That’s up substantially from the end of 2017 – around the time the market peaked – when just 3.8 million bitcoin, or 26 percent, was in the hands of individuals.The August numbers were the second-highest for individual accounts on record, and off only slightly from July’s high of 4.95 million bitcoin, or 33 percent of all coins in circulation.“There are more people who are holding crypto personally,” Chainalysis economist Philip Gradwell told CoinDesk.As a result, Gradwell said, “there’s a much larger supply that’s liquid. A lot of the people who bought [this year] are buying smaller amounts,” adding:“They are ready – if things were to change, [if] the opportunity to spend it were to arise – to actually spend it. We’ve kind of overcome the first hurdle of adoption, getting bitcoin into people’s hands.”Speaking to that potential, Gradwell said technical solutions aimed at improving bitcoin – like the much-lauded Lightning Network, which could enable faster payment processing options for merchants and service providers – could tip the scales for users deciding whether to transact with bitcoin or cash out during the next bull market.To be sure, bitcoin is still predominantly held as an inactive investment, whether custodied by an institution or individual, with 6.3 billion held in accounts that had no activity in over a year, according to Chainalysis data.Further, one person can control multiple wallets, so the data is an imperfect proxy for the adoption and distribution of bitcoin.And the original cryptocurrency’s deflationary supply and dramatic appreciation in its 10 years of existence tend to incentivize users to hold rather than spend, all else equal – many bitcoin proponents view this as a feature, not a bug.if(""undefined""==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper[""fpyRm""]={},window.datawrapper[""fpyRm""].embedDeltas={""100"":450,""200"":425,""300"":400,""400"":400,""500"":400,""700"":400,""800"":400,""900"":400,""1000"":400},window.datawrapper[""fpyRm""].iframe=document.getElementById(""datawrapper-chart-fpyRm""),window.datawrapper[""fpyRm""].iframe.style.height=window.datawrapper[""fpyRm""].embedDeltas[Math.min(1e3,Math.max(100*Math.floor(window.datawrapper[""fpyRm""].iframe.offsetWidth/100),100))]+""px"",window.addEventListener(""message"",function(a){if(""undefined""!=typeof a.data[""datawrapper-height""])for(var b in a.data[""datawrapper-height""])if(""fpyRm""==b)window.datawrapper[""fpyRm""].iframe.style.height=a.data[""datawrapper-height""][b]+""px""});if(""undefined""==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper[""V4eD7""]={},window.datawrapper[""V4eD7""].embedDeltas={""100"":475,""200"":425,""300"":400,""400"":400,""500"":400,""700"":400,""800"":400,""900"":400,""1000"":400},window.datawrapper[""V4eD7""].iframe=document.getElementById(""datawrapper-chart-V4eD7""),window.datawrapper[""V4eD7""].iframe.style.height=window.datawrapper[""V4eD7""].embedDeltas[Math.min(1e3,Math.max(100*Math.floor(window.datawrapper[""V4eD7""].iframe.offsetWidth/100),100))]+""px"",window.addEventListener(""message"",function(a){if(""undefined""!=typeof a.data[""datawrapper-height""])for(var b in a.data[""datawrapper-height""])if(""V4eD7""==b)window.datawrapper[""V4eD7""].iframe.style.height=a.data[""datawrapper-height""][b]+""px""});Whether bitcoin users are transacting with personal wallets or exchange accounts, Chainalysis economist Kimberly Grauer said the monetary aggregates for these categories have stabilized, suggesting news articles don’t spur as much dramatic trading activity as they did last year.“You don’t see wild fluctuations in the wealth between [investment accounts and active transactional accounts],” she told CoinDesk, adding:“This is a sign of a maturing market with less volatility.”Further, Chainalysis found that, from August to December, the amount of bitcoin held by service providers like exchange platforms increased by just 93,299. When viewed in light of the roughly 1 million bitcoin added to personal wallets over the same period, this implies the number of people using self-custody solutions is increasing at a faster rate than that of mere speculators.Adoption by merchants, legitimate or otherwise, is a different story. Gradwell said activity across various payment processing services and darknet markets hasn’t risen at the same rates as overall wallet activity, although it’s impossible to say how much activity represents peer-to-peer commerce.Gradwell described the current state of bitcoin wealth distribution as slightly more diverse, in part, thanks to long-term investors selling to new speculators late last year and earlier this year.Out of roughly 28.5 million bitcoin wallets across the market, he estimated only 150,000 of them hold more than 10 bitcoin each.Gradwell concluded:“Half of available bitcoin is still held by investors, but it has gotten somewhat less concentrated.”Bitcoin image via Shutterstock"

move towards the major support at $6,000, technical charts indicate.","Oct 11, 2018 at 11:00 UTC","Bitcoin’s drop to three-week lows today has likely kick-started a bearish move towards the major support at $6,000, technical charts indicate.","The leading cryptocurrency fell to $6,252 at 7:15 UTC on Bitfinex – the lowest level since Sept. 19 – and was last seen trading at $6,300, representing a 5-percent drop on a 24-hour basis.The failure to capitalize on Monday’s move above the crucial 10-week exponential moving average (EMA) resistance of $6,998, despite the upside break of a key falling trendline, ended up emboldening the bears, as expected.More importantly, the sell-off witnessed in the last few hours has put an end to a prolonged period of lateral trading. The technical indicators have rolled over in favor of the bears, adding credence to the bearish setup on the long duration charts.Further, the big drop in the equity markets this morning may not bode well for BTC, as the cryptocurrency is still being treated as a risk asset.As a result, the cryptocurrency is eyeing a drop toward $6,000. Here are four reasons why that is looking likely:The Bollinger bands (standard deviation of +2, -2 on the 20-day moving average) on the daily chart have been moving in a sideways manner since Sept. 22, signaling a lack of clear directional bias.As a result, bitcoin price volatility, as represented by Bollinger bandwidth and the gap between weekly high and low, fell to 21-month lows and 15-month lows, respectively, last week.A prolonged period of low volatility usually makes way for a big move in either direction. In BTC’s case, that move looks to have already started to the downside, with a breach of the lower band, and may move further towards $6,000.The relative strength index (RSI) has breached the rising trendline and fell into the bearish territory below 50.00. Notably, it is pointing lower and is well short of the oversold region (below 30.00), meaning there is enough room for a sell-off to $6,000.Meanwhile, the choppiness index has dropped below the 61.8 level and is pointing south, indicating that bearish move is gathering strength.Further, the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) has produced a bearish crossover.The bearish view put forward by the negative crossover between the 5-month and 10-month EMAs has gained more credence, courtesy of BTC’s failed breakout and a drop to three-week lows.Notably, the moving averages turned bearish last month for the first time since September 2014.BTC’s drop to lows below $6,300 comes a day after the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) shed 800 points. This isn’t the first time that the leading cryptocurrency has followed the action in the equity markets.As seen in the chart above, BTC pretty much mimicked the DJIA in the last quarter of 2017 and the first quarter of 2018.Looking ahead, the equities could drop further, courtesy of the rising bond yields, and push BTC lower.While many argue that BTC is a safe haven asset, the historical price action suggests that it in fact tracks equity markets. This is hardly surprising as BTC is still struggling to get mainstream exposure and investors may feel more secure with other classic safe-haven assets like gold (currently at $1,200 per Oz), which is also struggling to post gains.Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.Bitcoin image via Shutterstock; Charts by Trading View "

As such, bitcoin needs to rise above the September high of $7,400 to confirm a major bullish breakout.That would mean the number one cryptocurrency by market cap needs to rally close to 16 percent from the current price of $6,400 before the bulls can claim victory over the bears.Seasoned traders, however, are always on the lookout for patterns that might allow them to front-run an impending textbook bullish reversal.In bitcoin’s case, the 3-day chart – on which each candlestick represents price action over a 72-hour period – is signaling that the prospects of bullish reversal would rise sharply if prices can clear the former support-turned-resistance of the 50-candle simple moving average (SMA).As of writing, BTC is trading at $6,420 on Coinbase, representing a 0.5 percent drop in a 24-hour basis.The 50-candle SMA marked on the chart served as a strong support, or buying level, during the entire rally from October 2015 to December 2017.The SMA support became resistance in February after prices had dropped, and stayed in that role over the months since.Notably, the recent lower price high of $7,400 was created at the SMA hurdle, so a break above that resistance could be considered an early sign of bullish reversal.It’s worth noting that BTC’s bullish break above the 50-candle SMA in July ended up trapping the bulls on the wrong side of the market.Even so, the failed breakout was likely a result of the investor disappointment following the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s rejection of bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) at the time.Looking ahead, BTC is unlikely to trap the bulls this time round, as the majority of bad news has been priced in.Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.Bitcoin image via Shutterstock; charts by Trading View "

It had to grow to be strong, mighty and huge. It had to survive droughts, storms and predators. Its deep roots had to support the weight of becoming a new world reserve currency.To enjoy this article in its fullest, I recommend playing this song then continue reading. If you like this music, please follow my playlist on Spotify.Money is most easily defined as the medium in which value is transferred.But money is not just paper in your hand, or numbers in your bank account, money represents something much more fundamental:The main functions of money are Store of Value (SoV), Medium of Exchange (MoE), and Unit of Account (UoA). No money starts by providing all three functions, each new species of money follows a distinct evolutionary path that we will cover later. Let’s first start by identifying the newest species of money, bitcoin.“These protocols can’t be described comprehensively as static objective things. They’re best thought of as live systems.”  —  Ari PaulBitcoin is a new form of life, a new species of money called “cryptocurrency.” More importantly, it is “sound money,” or using proper taxonomy, “sanum pecuniam.” Sound money is defined as money that has a purchasing power determined by markets, independent of governments and political parties which is essential for individual freedom.“I had to write all the code before I could convince myself that I could solve every problem, then I wrote the paper.” —  Satoshi NakamotoThe code of life is written into an organism at its inception. Satoshi carefully architected Bitcoin’s DNA, or genetic code, to be the best sound money ever created.We can think of bitcoin’s genetic code as representing instructions that have been written to incentivize the organization and coordination of cellular function.“I believe I’ve worked through all those little details over the last year and a half while coding it, and there were a lot of them.” – Satoshi NakamotoBitcoin’s genetic code:“It lives and breathes on the internet. It lives because it can pay people to keep it alive. It lives because it performs a useful service that people will pay it to perform. It lives because anyone, anywhere, can run a copy of its code. It lives because all the running copies are constantly talking to each other. It lives because it is radically transparent: anyone can see its code and see exactly what it does. It can’t be changed. It can’t be argued with. It can’t be tampered with. It can’t be corrupted. It can’t be stopped. It can’t even be interrupted. If nuclear war destroyed half of our planet, it would continue to live, uncorrupted.”  — Ralph MerkleBitcoin’s genetic code manifests itself via traits (characteristics of an organism) that may or may not be visible.In biology, a trait or character is a feature of an organism.According to Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection, organisms that possess heritable traits that enable them to better adapt to their environment compared with other members of their species will be more likely to survive, reproduce, and pass more of their genes on to the next generation.Money is no different. Money has traits that enable it to survive and thrive as a Store of Value (SoV), Medium of Exchange (MoE), and Unit of Account (UoA). Bitcoin is a new species that has vastly superior traits to its predecessors. Below we dive deeper into those traits between different species of money.(The sections below, on the attributes that make for a good money, are largely borrowed from Vijay Boyapati‘s article “The Bullish Case for Bitcoin”)Fiat currencies and gold are fairly easy to verify for authenticity.However, despite providing features on their banknotes to prevent counterfeiting, nation-states and their citizens still face the potential to be duped by counterfeit bills. Gold is also not immune from being counterfeited.Sophisticated criminals have used gold-plated tungsten as a way of fooling gold investors into paying for false gold. Bitcoins, on the other hand, can be verified with absolute mathematical certainty.Gold provides the standard for fungibility.When melted down, an ounce of gold is nearly indistinguishable from any other ounce. Fiat currencies, on the other hand, are only as fungible as the issuing institutions allow them to be. While it may be the case that a fiat banknote is usually treated like any other by merchants accepting them, there are instances where large-denomination notes have been treated differently to small ones.For instance, India’s government, in an attempt to stamp out India’s untaxed gray market, completely demonetized their 500 and 1000 rupee banknotes. Bitcoins are fungible at the network level, meaning that every bitcoin, when transmitted, is treated the same on the Bitcoin network.However, because bitcoins are traceable on the blockchain, a particular bitcoin may become tainted by its use in illicit trade and merchants or exchanges may be compelled not to accept such tainted bitcoins.Despite this, there is no alternative pricing for “tainted Bitcoins” so it remains highly fungible.Bitcoins are the most portable store of value ever used by man.A single USB stick can contain a billion dollars, easily carried anywhere, transmitted near instantly. Fiat currencies, being fundamentally digital, are also highly portable.However, governments can control the free flow of capital. Cash can be used to avoid capital controls, but then the risk of storage and cost of transportation become significant. Gold, being physical in form and incredibly dense, is by far the least portable.When bullion is transferred between a buyer and a seller it is typically only the title to the gold that is transferred, not the physical bullion itself (It cost Germany $9.1 million to repatriate their gold).Gold is the king of durability — the vast majority of gold that has ever been mined or minted, including the gold of the Pharaohs, remains today and will for near eternity (it can only be destroyed through nuclear transmutation).While fiat currency exists both in physical and digital forms, we will only consider the durability of its digital form… the durability of the institution that issues them. Many fiat issuing governments have come and gone over the centuries, and their currencies disappeared with them.If history is a guide, it would be folly to consider fiat currencies durable in the long term — the US dollar and British Pound are relative anomalies in this regard. Bitcoins, having no issuing authority, may be considered durable so long as the network that secures them remains in place. Given that Bitcoin is still in its infancy, it is too early to draw strong conclusions about its durability.However, there are encouraging signs that the network displays a remarkable degree of “anti-fragility.”Bitcoins can be divided down to a hundred millionth of a bitcoin and transmitted at such infinitesimal amounts. Fiat currencies are typically divisible down to pocket change, which has little purchasing power, making fiat divisible enough in practice.Gold, while physically divisible, becomes difficult to use when divided into small enough quantities that it could be useful for lower-value day-to-day trade.The attribute that most clearly distinguishes Bitcoin from fiat currencies and gold is its predetermined absolute scarcity: only 21 million bitcoins can ever be created (the number of units is arbitrary, as bitcoins can be subdivided into 210 quadrillion satoshis).This gives the owner of bitcoins a known percentage of the total possible supply. Gold, while remaining quite scarce through history, is not immune to increases in supply. If it were ever the case that a new method of mining or acquiring gold became economic, the supply of gold could rise dramatically (ex: sea-floor or asteroid mining).Finally, fiat currencies, while only a relatively recent invention of history, have proven to be prone to constant increases in supply. Nation-states have shown a persistent proclivity to inflate their money supply to solve short-term political problems.No monetary good has a history as long and storied as gold, which has been valued for as long as human civilization has existed. Coins minted in the distant days of antiquity still maintain significant value today.The same cannot be said of fiat currencies, which are a relatively recent anomaly of history. From their inception, fiat currencies have had a near-universal tendency toward eventual worthlessness. The use of inflation as an insidious means of invisibly taxing a citizenry has been a temptation that no states in history have been able to resist.Bitcoin, despite its short existence, has weathered enough trials in the market that there is a high likelihood it will not vanish as a valued asset any time soon. Furthermore, the Lindy effect suggests that the longer Bitcoin remains in existence the greater society’s confidence that it will continue to exist long into the future. The median age of a human is ~30 years old, which means Bitcoin has been around for nearly 33.3% of the average human life.If bitcoin exists for 20 years, there will be near-universal confidence that it will be available forever, much as people believe the Internet is a permanent feature of the modern world.One of the most significant sources of early demand for bitcoins was their use in the illicit drug trade. Silk Road was a testament to this resistance.The key attribute that makes bitcoin valuable for proscribed activities is that it is “permissionless” at the network level. When bitcoins are transmitted on the bitcoin network, there is no human intervention deciding whether the transaction should be allowed.As a distributed peer-to-peer network, bitcoin is, by its very nature, designed to be censorship-resistant. This is in stark contrast to the fiat banking system, where states regulate banks and the other gatekeepers of money transmission to report and prevent outlawed uses of monetary goods. A classic example of regulated money transmission is capital controls.A wealthy millionaire, for instance, may find it very hard to transfer their wealth to a new domicile if they wish to flee an oppressive regime (Russian assets in the UK being frozen). Although gold is not issued by states, its physical nature makes it difficult to transmit at distance, making it far more susceptible to state regulation than bitcoin.India’s Gold Control Act is an example of such regulation. If your mission is to disrupt central banks, you need to have sovereign level censorship resistance.“Bitcoin’s advantages lie not in its speed, convenience, or friendly user experience. Bitcoin’s value comes from it having an immutable monetary policy precisely because nobody can easily change it.” —  Saifedean AmmousMoney that is costly to create, due either to its original cost (gold mining) or the improbability of its history (art) — and that it is difficult to fake this costliness. Bitcoin’s PoW ensures the cost to mine a Bitcoin is near equivalent to how much it would cost to purchase one on an exchange. The unforgeable costliness pattern includes the following basic steps:“(1) find or create a class of objects that is highly improbable, takes much effort to make, or both, and such that the measure of their costliness can be verified by other parties. (2) use the objects to enable a protocol or institution to cross trust boundaries” – Nick SzaboBitcoin is open-source; its design is public, it is usable by anyone/anywhere/anytime. Developers can freely program applications on top of the Bitcoin protocol without having to ask anyone for permission.“It is dynamic, upgradable and extendable. It does not need throwing out and replacing with each new iteration, it will continuously improve.” —  Neil WoodfineIn it’s simplest definition, decentralization means a lack of centralized control. Or the degree to which an entity within the system can resist coercion and still function as part of the system. Coercion doesn’t necessarily mean force, it means negative incentives to align with an authority.Decentralization is an important trait for money because any centralized control could threaten any one of the other traits (especially scarcity and censorship resistance)Decentralization is also important because it enables greater social scalability. The challenge is that natural systems inherently evolve towards centralization (hierarchies). We see this emergent property in cryptocurrencies as well. Hierarchy is an emergent property of networks. When we consider more complex systems, we must contend with more complex relationships between the layers. Quantifying decentralization is an especially thorny issue.“Decentralization is such a misunderstood concept, because people apply it to a whole system, when really it needs to be applied to multiple layers within the system: The Protocol, The Politics and The Practical.”  —  Sarah LewisFor a species of money to survive, it needs to be competitive on every attribute and be exceptionally better on a few of them. Attributes don’t sum, they multiply.When Gold was first introduced, the bead makers (an example of a more primitive form of money) probably tried to convince the ignorant population that gold was no substitute for beads. But it turned out that gold had traits that were more advantageous. It did not matter what anyone thought. Gold was destined to be a more powerful currency than shells or beads.The fact that gold has remained a valued commodity for thousands of years speaks to the importance of these specific traits. In fact, the combination of traits possessed by gold and other precious metals eventually provided the foundation for the next evolution in money, fiat currency.In money’s next evolution of species, fiat currency fulfilled several critical traits to an even greater degree than gold. Paper was more portable and could be more easily transacted.That is not to say it was entirely superior. In many cases, fiat currencies lacked durability, and as we will see, would eventually become less and less scarce (due to inflation). The critical flaw: its supply was controlled by kings and governments and increasingly used as a tool to wield power and control. Upon every new iteration of species, they each evolve in the following four stages (taken from “The Bullish Case for Bitcoin”):Bitcoin’s stage in the evolutionary process is shown below, provided by Murad Mahmudov.Extinction can most simply be described as the failure of a species to compete in an environment to such at a degree that it eventually ceases to exist. The inability to compete itself may be the result of two primary causes; increased competition from superior species or a dramatic change in environment.“Charles Darwin’s theory of natural selection originated to provide an evidence-based explanation of the past. We now leverage this theory to look forward and understand its implications on the future of currency. Given the ever-changing conditions of the future, will gold and fiat currencies continue to compete or go the way of the dinosaur?” —  Ryan Walker “On the Origins of Money: Darwin and the Evolution of Cryptocurrency”According to a study of 775 fiat currencies by DollarDaze.org the average life expectancy of a fiat currency is 27 years. The study also indicated the most common causes of any given currencies extinction are hyperinflation, monetary reform, war and independence.Looking towards the fittest of fiat currencies, those that become reserve currencies, we find that most last just under 100 years. (Note: US currency only starts from 1933 because USD was redeemable for gold prior to that)With fiat currencies being so susceptible to failure, gold has long served as an alternative as it is more scarce and durable. In terms of scarcity, fiat currencies can be printed and inflated at the will of their authorities.“While Bitcoin is a new invention of the digital age, the problems it purports to solve — namely, providing a form of money that is under the full command of its owner and likely to hold its value in the long run — are as old as human society itself.”  — Saifedean AmmousThe currencies are in a state of hyper-evolution as they continue to take on a varied array of distinctive traits that set them apart from one another within their own competitive ecosystem (fiat/crypto).Equally as threatening to traditional forms of money, the conditions of the environment in which currencies compete is in a constant state of change. Undertones of growing distrust in centralized entities encourage populations to consider alternative stores of value.Sovereignty, once a trait that was necessary for the survival of a currency, may now be falling out of favor. Centralized failures such as the US financial crisis of 2008 or hyper-inflated fiat currencies such as Zimbabwe dollars or Argentinian pesos compound these sentiments. The most profound of these conditions is the growing awareness throughout the world that decentralized trust is possible.Instead of becoming anti-fragile, which is the property of growing stronger in a volatile and stressful environment, central banks have removed danger and mortality from failure, which causes competition to stagnate or degrade.Sometimes stresses are so strong that they are fatal for a species of money. While this is devastating for the money itself, the population comprised of those that survive are fitter on average. This isn’t because any of the survivors grew stronger from the stress, but simply because the weaker monies were removed.“We humans regularly underestimate high-impact, long-tail events. Careful consideration of long tail events is especially important in the design of a protocol that has the potential to become the backbone of the global economy” — Hugo NguyenIt is interesting to imagine what Charles Darwin would make of the current state of money. History would have us believe that the existence and survival of any entity, be it plant, animal, corporation, or money is the subject to the laws of natural selection.With this understanding, it is hard to imagine Darwin contesting the opinion that Bitcoin possesses the necessary traits to become the dominant species of money.Bitcoin is perfectly honed for its environment through its exceptional genetic code and the manifestation of that code in the form of superior traits.Bitcoin is the apex predator of money, and is constantly evolving. None of the previous monetary life forms stand a chance.In Part 2, I will cover the season in which Bitcoin was planted — the 2008 financial crisis.

Since then, however, it hasn’t translated this into gains for investors.Rather, the price appears to be following a pattern last seen ahead of a bullish reversal from September 2015.Why is that important for traders now? When the bull market ended last time around, we saw a violent drop in price whereby bulls were unable to produce any significant highs over the course of the year.Comparing 2018 to 2015, there are other subtle similarities to draw on for analysts.In both 2015 and 2018, the price experienced peaks up 36 percent from their respective troughs in July, a development only to be followed through by a poor August performance.The difference, however, is that while 2015’s trend was finally broken by a higher high on July 6, bitcoin’s current bearish trend has not been breached in 2018. As such, breaking that trend at $8,500 (the previous significant high) could be key should history repeat.September, then, could be the make or break for the comparison, as the current uptrend that began August 24, has been slow and steady resulting in a more convincing move as it edges closer to the previous monthly high.Over on the daily chart, we can see BTC has produced a series of lower highs in the first seven months of 2018.Bears who have been in full control since the start of the year have defied each attempt to move higher, slapping bulls down with added sell pressure. However, the subtle differences between each drop have lessened in intensity.More importantly, despite the lower highs, the bears have repeatedly failed to secure a weekly close below the February low of $6,000. Further, BTC’s rally from the August low of $5,859 has created a first higher low of the year.So, it seems safe to say that the stage is set for BTC to print the first higher price high of the year by moving above the July high of $8,500.ViewThe author holds USDT at time of writingSlide image via Shutterstock; Chart via TradingView"

However, the institutional money is still largely waiting at the gates – a situation that may change if the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approves BTC exchange-traded funds in the coming months.BTC topped out around $20,000 in December 2017 but has dropped significantly this year. However, many believe the cryptocurrency has charted a bottom at around $6,000 in the last four months, although a bullish reversal is seen only above the September high of $7,400.Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.Bitcoin image via Shutterstock; charts by Trading View "

That’s the longest volatility has been so low since April 2017.It is worth noting that BTC averaged around $1,200 in April and early May of 2017. Further, the average daily volatility during that period was $33, that is, prices moved 2.75 percent on a daily basis. Hence, back then, a $100 daily volatility reading was a normal thing.As of now, BTC is averaging around $6,500 and the average daily volatility has dropped to $56 in the last seven days, meaning prices are moving just 0.86 percent on a daily basis. So, it seems safe to say that we are witnessing an unprecedented period of low volatility.Such calm periods often end in a big move on either side. However, bitcoin price volatility has been falling over months now and a promised sustained shift to either bulls or bears has so far not materialized.Under these conditions, the best thing to do is to jot down the key levels and trade the breakout.A break above the September high of $7,400 would put an end to the series of lower price highs (marked by circles). The bull breakout, if confirmed, would open the doors to a stronger rally to $10,000. On the way higher, BTC may encounter resistance at the July highs near $8,500.As seen in the weekly chart above, BTC seems to have carved out a bottom around $6,000. The likes of billionaire investor Novogratz have also echoed similar sentiments recently. As a result, $6,000 is the level to beat for the bears.Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.Bitcoin image via Shutterstock; charts by Trading View "

BTC also registered a 10-percent decline in August, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).However, despite the back-to-back monthly losses, the cryptocurrency is flashing a 2 percent gain for the third quarter. Further, the quarterly gain could have been much bigger had the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) not rejected a notable application for a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).Bitcoin jumped to a two-month high of $8,507 on July 25, confirming an upside break of the four-month-long falling channel.However, the long-term bearish-to-bullish trend change was short-lived as prices fell back below $8,000 on July 27, courtesy of the SEC’s second rejection of the Winklevoss brothers’ application for a bitcoin ETF.Nevertheless, the leading cryptocurrency posted a 21 percent gain in July, snapping the longest losing streak in nearly two years.BTC was down for the first two weeks the ETF rejection in late July. The cryptocurrency fell to a low of $5,859 on Bitfinex on Aug. 14 before rising back to $7,000 by the month’s end.Signaling a rotation of money out of high-risk alternative cryptocurrencies and into bitcoin, and possibly into fiat currencies, the BTC dominance rate also rose above 50 percent for the first time since Dec. 19, 2017.It is worth noting that the SEC disapproved several other ETF proposals in the second half of August month. Yet, BTC remained well bid, possibly because the investor community had priced in the widely expected bad news.That resilience triggered speculation that better times lie ahead for the cryptocurrency and overshadowed the 10 percent monthly decline in prices.BTC’s rise to highs above $7,500 in the first half of the month was supplemented by the bullish turn in the weekly MACD. As a result, the cryptocurrency was looking likely to rise further toward July highs above $8,500.Instead, prices fell sharply on Sept. 5, leaving another lower high around $7,500 on the daily chart. The rising wedge breakdown on the daily chart signaled a resumption of the sell-off from the July highs. But, once again, the area around $6,000 proved a tough nut to crack for the bears.The cryptocurrency’s persistent defense of $6,000 has convinced many, including the likes of billionaire investor Novogratz and Fundstrat’s Tom Lee, that the BTC market is experiencing seller fatigue and has reached a bottom around $6,000.However, a bullish reversal would be confirmed only after BTC has found acceptance above the recent lower price high of $7,429.On the weekly chart, BTC has charted a narrowing price range. Interestingly, the upper edge of the range is located around that $7,429 (August high) price point.A move above that level would signal a bearish-to-bullish trend change and allow a stronger rally toward key resistances located at $8,507 (July high) and even $9,990 (May high).Any bullish move post-breakout could be a rapid one as a prolonged period of range-bound trading is often followed by a big spike in volatility, according to technical theory.The prospects of BTC witnessing bull breakout in the fourth quarter are high as the cryptocurrency tends to perform well in the last three months of the calendar year, seasonality analysis indicates.if(""undefined""==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper[""JKCPP""]={},window.datawrapper[""JKCPP""].embedDeltas={""100"":460.020834,""200"":433.020834,""300"":407.020834,""400"":407.020834,""500"":407.020834,""700"":407.020834,""800"":407.020834,""900"":407.020834,""1000"":407.020834},window.datawrapper[""JKCPP""].iframe=document.getElementById(""datawrapper-chart-JKCPP""),window.datawrapper[""JKCPP""].iframe.style.height=window.datawrapper[""JKCPP""].embedDeltas[Math.min(1e3,Math.max(100*Math.floor(window.datawrapper[""JKCPP""].iframe.offsetWidth/100),100))]+""px"",window.addEventListener(""message"",function(a){if(""undefined""!=typeof a.data[""datawrapper-height""])for(var b in a.data[""datawrapper-height""])if(""JKCPP""==b)window.datawrapper[""JKCPP""].iframe.style.height=a.data[""datawrapper-height""][b]+""px""}); As can be seen on the above performance table, the cryptocurrency scored gains in the fourth quarter in six out of the last eight years.The pattern looks likely to repeat itself, given the cryptocurrency is down 70 percent from the record high of $20,000 clocked in December 2017 and sellers seem to have run dry around $6,000.Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.Bitcoin image via Shutterstock; Charts by Trading View"

Interestingly, the moving averages on the short duration charts are aligned for a potential break above the triangle resistance.At press time, BTC is trading largely unchanged on the day at $6,440 on Coinbase.The 50-, 100- and 200-hour exponential moving averages (EMAs) are trending north, indicating a bullish setup. Further, the stacking order of the 50-hour EMA above the 100-hour EMA, above the 200-hour EMA is a classic bullish signal.As a result, BTC is more likely to cut through the upper edge of the triangle, currently at $6,460.Another sign of a possible building directional change comes from the choppiness index, which has dipped below the 38.2 percent level.So, it seems safe to say that triangle breakout, if confirmed, could yield a sharp move higher, possibly toward $6,800.Over on the daily chart, BTC has cleared the trendline falling from July highs and the 5-day and 10-day EMAs are beginning to rise in favor of the bulls.Thus, prospects of a triangle breakout are high.ViewDisclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.Bitcoin image via Shutterstock; charts by Trading View "

In reality, however, it is the result of a prolonged bear market – i.e., it’s a backward-looking indicator. As a result, the oversold market usually sees a bounce after a bearish crossover is confirmed.In this case, the crossover looks likely to occur in the next few days. The bulls, however, are cautioned against betting on a follow-up price jump immediately, as prices dropped 50 percent in the four weeks following the death cross confirmation in mid-December 2014.At press time, the leading cryptocurrency is trading at $6,185 on Bitstamp, representing a 0.8 percent drop on a 24-hour basis.On the three-day chart, the impending death cross can be seen as the confluence of the 50-candle and 200-candle simple moving average (SMA), which have closed sharply in the last three months.Further, the relative strength index (RSI) of 41.00 is biased toward the bears and holding well above the oversold territory (below 30.00).Therefore, prices could be in for a deeper drop in the short-term, possibly to levels below the June low of $5,774.It’s worth noting that the sell-off witnessed after the death cross seen in December 2014 ended up carving a long-term bottom at $152 in January 2015. On similar lines, the impending crossover and the resulting slide in prices, if any, could turn out to be the final leg of the bear market.As for today, the cryptocurrency is looking weak, having found acceptance below the trendline connecting the Oct. 11 and Oct. 31 lows.Over on the daily chart, the violation of the ascending trendline support is backed by the downward sloping 5- and 10-day SMAs. This backs up the view that deeper losses toward $6,000 could be in the offing in the next 24 hours.Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.Bitcoin image via Shutterstock; charts by Trading View "

Casey is the chairman of CoinDesk’s advisory board and a senior advisor for blockchain research at MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative.,"The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers.Rekt? You should see the other guy.For anyone concerned about bitcoin losing another 4 percent in October to post its third straight monthly loss, it’s worth comparing that loss to those seen by traditional financial markets.By standard measures, last month was the worst on Wall Street since the 2008 financial crisis. The Nasdaq lost 9.2 percent, the Dow Jones Industrials, 6.9 percent, and the S&P 500, 5.1 percent. Riskier markets such as tech stocks and emerging markets were hit especially hard.A 4 percent decline is still hefty. But given its past volatility, the lead cryptocurrency’s relative stability amid the angst on the Street is notable.The general impression produced by last year’s wild crypto bubble was that bitcoin and all other such tokens exist at the extreme end of the speculative class of assets. So, if world markets become risk-averse, as they did severely last month, the thinking was that people would dump bitcoin along with every other high-risk asset in their flight to dollars.Instead, up until Monday, October 30, when bitcoin suffered a $200 drop, it was more or less stable. By crypto standards, it was a boring month.It might be tempting to conclude that bitcoin is attracting a safe-haven bid, that people are looking to hedge their risks with a stable-yet-liquid asset that’s immune from the politics of financial crises. The idea is that bitcoin is starting to assert itself as a new type of uncorrelated reserve asset, a digital gold for the digital age.But the truth is there is very little of this safe-haven buying going on in bitcoin prices right now. There was no noticeable spike in transactions last month, just more of the very, very gradual increase that has occurred off the low base reached during the post-bubble period of the late winter.While there are surely some newcomers shifting their assets into bitcoin, especially in places like Venezuela, there’s no great wave of people suddenly realizing that this new digital asset might be a hedge against future political and economic turmoil.So why did this notoriously volatile asset have a relatively quiet October?One way to think about it is to reflect on the changing nature of the bitcoin investment community, which can be divided into speculators and buy-and-holders – better known as hodlers.The speculators who dominated the community last year have gone – certainly the newcomers who drove the bitcoin price to its ridiculous peak above $19,000 in December. You know the type: your mother, your cousin or that high school friend you hadn’t spoken to for years who asked for tips on what coins to buy.That leaves the hodlers, the true believers, those in it for the long term. These people are far less likely to care about turmoil in world markets putting their dollar-based wealth at risk. Many don’t even measure their risk exposure in dollar terms.They don’t – at least to a point. You see, here’s the thing: This remaining community of hodlers may soon be the guinea pigs in a much more important bitcoin stress test.What happens if, as a number of market prognosticators believe, things get truly nasty economically?I mean 2008-like nasty, when a financial crisis morphed into a full-blown economic crisis. Will these diehards resist liquidating their bitcoin assets then?The answer may be a function of their real-world economic profiles. Do most of them comprise developers and entrepreneurs paid in bitcoin and ether whose expenditures are also largely for goods and services remunerated in the same? If they can subsist in the crypto economy, then maybe they’ll keep hodling.If they do hang on, they’ll give bitcoin an impressive show of stability. Amid economic chaos, such resilience would look quite impressive to the outside world, potentially drawing another round of newcomers into the mix – not speculative “too the moon” lambo-hunters but people who get the idea that this is a valuable hedging asset for the digital economy.The number of people who live in that crypto-dominant economy is bigger than is recognized by crypto critics, who tend to see every action of this community through the lens of investors marking their profits and losses to market in dollar terms. Still, it’s difficult to say whether this group is big enough to offset the many others for whom a serious 2008-like blow to their fiat incomes will drive them to liquidate bitcoin along with other assets.Complicating matters is the fact that a host of new exchanges, custodial services and trading platforms are coming that could attract large institutions into this market. There might be a sizable amount of Wall Street money coming into bitcoin over the coming year.Bitcoin speculators hoping to turn their holdings into dollar-based fortunes tend to see this as a positive prospect, assuming the influx of funds will drive up the price. But while that might happen in the short term, the experience of last year, when short-selling accompanied the introduction of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s and Chicago Board Options Exchange’s cash-settled bitcoin futures contracts, is that these professional solutions can also invite volatility.These new institutional tools give the big guys greater capacity to get in, but they also give them the means to get out. Hedge funds are definitely not interested in hodling for holding’s sake.This stability may not last, in other words. It’s another matter whether that provides the kind of stress test that bitcoin needs to prove itself as a reserve asset.Bitcoin hammer image via Shutterstock"

As disclosed ...","Sep 21, 2018 at 22:30 UTC",This week’s major bitcoin bug was even worse than developers initially let on.,"The bug originally rocked the bitcoin world when it was reported the vulnerability could be used to shut down a chunk of the network.While this sounded bad enough for many, it turns out developers for Bitcoin Core kept a second, bigger part of the bug a secret. As disclosed through an official Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) report, an attacker could have actually used it to create new bitcoin – above the 21 million hard-cap of coin creation – thereby inflating the supply and devaluing current bitcoins.Such a perversion of the rules would, at worst, according to many, make users not trust the cryptocurrency anymore.Because of the disastrous implications of the bug, developers decided to keep it a secret, buying themselves time to fix the exploit and urge miners and users to upgrade their software.The CVE report written by Bitcoin Core developers explains:“In order to encourage rapid upgrades, the decision was made to immediately patch and disclose the less serious denial of service vulnerability, concurrently with reaching out to miners, businesses and other affected systems, while delaying publication of the full issue to give time for systems to upgrade.”And for now, the plan seems to have worked.Over half of bitcoin’s mining hash rate has upgraded to the patched software version, meaning the attack can no longer be used, and developers are “unaware of any attempts to exploit this vulnerability,” the report states.Finding such a serious bug was a stressful position for developers to be in.According to the report, an anonymous user originally filed a report about the denial-of-service bug to top developers of Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin ABC, the main software implementation of bitcoin cash. About two hours later, Chaincode engineer and Bitcoin Core developer Matt Corallo realized the bug could have been exploited to print unlimited bitcoin.Based on the seriousness of the vulnerability, the developers decided to keep those details secret at first.Instead, beginning with Slush Pool, they started pushing miners to upgrade. And for bitcoin users running a full node, the call to action is the same.“You should not run any version of Bitcoin Core other than 0.16.3. Older versions should not exist on the network. If you know anyone who is running an older version, tell them to upgrade it ASAP,” bitcoin subreddit moderator Theymos remarked in a post currently pinned to the top of the forum.Yet, another problem exists now – the possibility of a bitcoin chain splitSince users are now running different versions of the bitcoin software, there’s a risk the network will temporarily split into two, then come back together again. Transactions on the chain running old software, then, might ultimately be lost.While the situation is being monitored closely, Theymos thinks the risk of this happening is small. But, he argued that people should still take precautions, such as waiting longer to make sure a bitcoin transaction actually gets verified.Theymos added:“For the next week or so you should consider there to be a small possibility of any transaction with less than 200 confirmations being reversed.”What’s on some users’ minds, still though, is whether it’s possible the bug has already been exploited.“How do we know if that vulnerability wasn’t exploited already and there is someone out there with a bunch of fake bitcoin?” asked one bitcoin user.Luckily, Bitcoin Core contributor Pieter Wuille explained, due to the power of code, bitcoin users would have been able to detect suspicious activity by now.When downloaded for the first time, full nodes double check every transaction made in bitcoin’s history. A node running the new software, 0.16.3, would detect the problem immediately.Even so, questions remain regarding what would have happened if the bug wasn’t caught in time.According to Theymos: “Even if the bug had been exploited to its full extent, the theoretical damage to stored funds would have been rolled back.”Theymos continued, saying that rollback would be much like what happened during the so-called “value overflow incident” in 2010 when 187 billion bitcoins were created out of thin air but, ultimately, were destroyed.Still, while Bitcoin Core, litecoin and several other coins that were based Bitcoin Core’s code have released a patch for the exploit, others have not – and might still be vulnerable to the inflation bug.Code image via Shutterstock"

Further, brief dips below that level quickly bounced back.The price action suggests that the bears have likely run out of steam and BTC may have carved out a bottom close to $6,000.However, that argument would lose credence if prices close today below $6,108, signaling a resumption of the sell-off from the record highs reached in December last year.At press time, BTC is trading at $6,265 on Coinbase, having hit a two-week low of $6,211 on Monday.As can be seen above, the 5- and 10-month EMAs produced a bearish cross last month for the first time since 2014, meaning the bears are already in control here.Hence, a close below the 21-month EMA will likely prove costly.The prospects of a bullish reversal above $7,400 (September high) would improve if BTC defends the EMA support for the fifth month straight.Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.Bitcoin and USD image via Shutterstock; Charts by Trading View"

What did it get wrong? And what questions do we still not know the answer to?This may be the hardest category to compile.One mark of a truly successful idea is that we forget how people thought about the world before that idea came around. Many of the most fundamental contributions of Bitcoin seem obvious only in hindsight.It’s easy to forget that cryptocurrency was a research backwater for most of the 2000s. After the failure of many attempts in the 1990s to build a working system (largely using the ideas outlined by David Chaum in the 1980s), few papers were published in the area. Many simply believed there was no viable market for a non-state currency.Prior to Bitcoin, decentralized systems were an active research area in the 2000s (often described as peer-to-peer networks) and anonymity research was coming into its own (with the development of Tor and other systems).But these were not seen as necessary features for a payment system. What did Bitcoin contribute?We’ll ignore some quaint-in-retrospect features in early versions of the bitcoin code, such as pay-to-IP-address and a built-in e-commerce system, that never saw the light of day.But there are several features of Bitcoin that appear “wrong” in that no system built today should repeat them.Arial maze via Shutterstock"

Up to Oct. 31, the two key support levels were the 21-month EMA and the trendline drawn between the June and August lows.In particular, the 21-month EMA was the level to beat for the bears till last month, meaning a close below that support would likely have revived the sell-off from the record high of $20,000 seen last December.While the 21-month EMA still remains a crucial support, the new make-or-break level is the seven-year-long rising trendline.That’s because the trendline support, which was located around $5,300 last month, has now moved closer to the current price and is seen rising above $6,300 in December. Hence, it may now be incorrect to call a break below the 21-month EMA a sign of a bear revival.At press time, BTC is changing hands at $6,330 on Bitstamp, representing a 0.5 percent drop on a 24-hour basis.On the monthly chart, a break below the trendline support of $5,830 would strengthen the bear grip and allow a drop to the psychological support of $5,000.The bulls, however, would feel emboldened if the cryptocurrency produces a strong bounce off that key support.As for the next 24 hours, investors should keep an eye on the symmetrical triangle seen in the chart below.The upper edge of the symmetrical triangle, currently at $6,400, is proving a tough nut to crack on the daily chart.

It said on Thursday that the exchange first noticed an unusual outflow of funds on the platform around 17:00 Japan time on September 14, after which the company suspended asset deposit and withdrawal services.Tech Bureau explained that after further investigation, it discovered that hackers with unauthorized access to the exchange’s hot wallets had stolen roughly $60 million in bitcoin, bitcoin cash, and MonaCoin. That being said, the exact amount of bitcoin cash stolen remains unknown.The exchange added that since its own asset reserve is currently around 2.2 billion yen (or $20 million), it has reached an agreement with a Japan-listed firm called Fisco to receive a $44.5 million investment in exchange for a major share of ownership.Tech Bureau said given the nature of the unauthorized fund access, it has filed the incident as a criminal case to local authorities for further investigation.The incident marks the second hack in Japan this year, after Coincheck also reported that a whopping $520 million in NEM tokens were stolen by hackers in January.Following Coincheck’s hack, the Financial Services Agency (FSA) – Japan’s financial watchdog – has launched a series of inspections on cryptocurrency exchanges in the country regarding their security measures.The FSA had already notably issued a business improvement order to Tech Bureau in March specifically on its security and anti-money laundering enhancement.Japanese yen image via CoinDesk"

As a result, they brought the case to the arbitrator, seeking the return of the assets with interest.The cryptocurrencies at dispute included around 20 bitcoin, 50 bitcoin cash, and 13 bitcoin diamond, worth around $493,158 combined, the plaintiff said.While there’s no specific law in China governing cryptocurrencies, the arbitrator’s analysis offers a window into its thinking on the nature of the financial technology.The arbitrator said one main argument made by the defendant was that the ban from the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) on cryptocurrency trading and initial coin offerings essentially means crypto payments and transactions should be illegal in China. As such, the entire contract, by default, would become invalid.Further, with the trading ban, the defendant said there was no venue to trade and send the assets to the plaintiff.However, the arbitrator disagreed, explaining the nature of the case is about the contractual obligation for returning cryptocurrencies, which does not fall under the cryptocurrency trading or initial coin offering categories outlined in the PBoC’s September 2017 ban.The arbitrator stated that there is no law in China currently that prohibits the possession of bitcoin and its transactions between individuals. Further, it said there should be no technical difficulties in sending bitcoin as long as one has a bitcoin address and private key.“The Arbitration Court noticed that, after September 2017, major bitcoin exchanges operating in China at the time suspended their businesses. But technically, that fact does not prevent the defendant from sending the bitcoin and bitcoin cash at dispute to the plaintiff upon the agreed deadline,” the arbitrator said.The court concluded that, whether bitcoin is a legal tender or not, does not have an impact on the fact that bitcoin ownership should be protected legally based on China’s contract law, adding:“Bitcoin has the nature of a property, which can be owned and controlled by parties, and is able to provide economic values and benefits.”The court is one of the Arbitration Committees established in China after the country enacted a law in 1995 enabling city governments to form such entities to rule on economic disputes relating to contract issues in areas such as business, finance and real estate.Chinese door via Shutterstock"

In particular, CoinGeek, the platform owned by Wright supporter Calvin Ayre, jumped from controlling about 30.6 percent of the overall hash power to 41 percent.In contrast, okminer and Mempool both lost a significant portion of the hash power, falling from 7.64 percent and 6.25 percent respectively to 3.47 percent each.Meanwhile, mining pools supporting the Bitcoin ABC implementation spearheaded by Roger Ver have made gains of their own. In particular, Bitcoin.com, Antpool and BTC.com now control 8.33, 4.86 and 6.25 percent of the total hash power respectively. Antpool and BTC.com are controlled by bitcoin cash supporter and hardware giant Bitmain.As of yesterday, both of Bitmain’s pools only controlled 2.78 percent of the power each, while Ver’s website had 6.25 percent.While several mining pools have firmly declared support for one party or another, a number have yet to publicly express which network they might help secure. The most prominent of these is ViaBTC, which controlled 7.64 percent of the network total yesterday, though its relative power dropped to 2.08 percent by 14:00 UTC Tuesday.Another pool, Northern Bitcoin, likewise has yet to commit to a particular implementation, though chief technology officer Moritz Jäger told Forbes that his pool switched from bitcoin to bitcoin cash to be among “the decision makers on the upcoming fork.”Still, while Bitcoin SV seems to have a clear advantage in hash power, traders seem more confident about Bitcoin ABC.BCHABC, a trading pair being offered in advance at some exchange, is still trading at a higher price than markets for SV, though its lead has shrunk slightly. At press time, pre-fork trading of the token hovered around $391 (priced in the USDC stablecoin), down from $415 just 24 hours ago.In contrast, BCHSV’s price surged 22 percent in that time period to reach $136.According to TradingView, BCHABC may also be seeing less interest in terms of volume, with only  876,258 USDC being traded over the past 24 hours, up from 818,375 yesterday.BCHSV, on the other hand, saw 969,715 USDC in volume over that period, though this fell from more than 1.2 million USDC traded previously.Bitcoin cash fork image via Shutterstock"

implementation of the blockchain software, Craig Wright seems to ...","Nov 8, 2018 at 03:25 UTC",“Do not come crying when you are bankrupt.”,"Lobbed at those bitcoin cash enthusiasts supporting Bitcoin ABC, the main implementation of the blockchain software, Craig Wright seems to have no intention to compromise as the cryptocurrency gears up for its next system-wide upgrade, or hard fork.The controversial figure who claims (without much evidence) that he is bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto has long been one of the leading figures of bitcoin cash, the fourth largest cryptocurrency by market cap, which famously broke off of bitcoin in the heat of the scaling debate last year.But while he was initially embraced by the bitcoin cash community, he’s now in the middle of a battle over its future.While bitcoin cash has undergone several hard forks over its one-year lifespan, the forthcoming one – set for November 15 – doesn’t have consensus from all the community.The arguments started over which set of upgrades should be included in the code change. And less than a week from the activation date, the debate looks like it’s going to split bitcoin cash into two different cryptocurrencies – one running Bitcoin ABC and the other running software created by Wright’s company nChain called Bitcoin Satoshi’s Vision (or Bitcoin SV). Though there aren’t many data points so far, an experimental predictive trading market indicates that Bitcoin ABC has more user support.And although Wright isn’t quite endorsing an attack fully, on Twitter he seemed to provide a rationale for miners to use their power to “kill off” the blockchain running Bitcoin ABC. According to Wright, by deploying hashpower, Bitcoin SV miners can effectively mine empty blocks on the competing bitcoin cash blockchain, stopping transactions from going through.Wright argues that these kinds of things are “a part of the protocol” and thus fine to do (and to his point, there are not rules preventing this).And sure enough, one new mining project called SharkPool tweeted that it will “exclusively” mine empty blocks, pointing to Wright’s tweetstorm as reasoning.Still, Peter R. Rizun, the chief scientist for Bitcoin Unlimited, the second most popular software implementation of bitcoin cash, contends these threats are likely “a bluff” meant to scare Bitcoin ABC supporters.Yet others, including Chris Pacia, a developer for ecommerce platform Open Bazaar and also on bitcoin cash, believe this to be the malicious attack of a man “hell-bent on getting his way.”Pacia told CoinDesk:“I don’t mind splitting Craig Wright off, but he’s threatened to destroy the other chain with a 51% [attack]. That’s really uncool.”If you’ve been in bitcoinland for long, this could all sound pretty familiar.It was a little more than a year ago that bitcoin was seeped in debate about how to scale the network, and the community was battling over a seemingly very small feature of the online money: the size of its block size parameter.Not everyone agreed on the way forward, so the debate into threats of a split. Bitcoin miners, much like Wright, even threatened to attack the other chain after the split.Thus was forged bitcoin cash, a cryptocurrency which scrapped the upgrade Segregated Witness (SegWit) for a much larger block size parameter.And while the bitcoin cash community largely agreed on the crypto’s way forward for this first year, this harmonious face began to crack as the community grew. Soon enough, the community found itself immersed in its own block size debate.The Bitcoin ABC software upgrade features a couple of key technical changes, including a so-called opcode to make it easier to execute “atomic swaps,” a technology for trustlessly trading one cryptocurrency for another. But it does not increase the block size any further – currently bitcoin cash has 32 MB block sizes.But Wright’s Bitcoin SV wants to see an increase in the block size parameter from 32 MB to 128 MB.It’s technical – and some would claim unnecessary at this point – but over the past several months, bitcoin cash supporters have begun choosing sides.The largest bitcoin cash mining pool, CoinGeek, for instance, publicly announced that they were in support of Bitcoin SV (and bigger blocks) in August. On the flip side, information site and mining pool Bitcoin.com (run by perhaps bitcoin cash’s most vocal supporters, including Roger Ver) recently announced support for Bitcoin ABC.As a result of the ongoing controversy, many bitcoin cash-supporting businesses and exchanges – including Binance, Coinbase and Polintriza, as well as, instant payments application Money Button – have largely frozen operations for the time being.Speaking to the nature of the upcoming hard fork or forks, CEO of Money Button Ryan X. Charles said that eventually “users running implementations of the bitcoin cash software will have no choice but to upgrade to either one of the two competing.”So while the debate seems pretty technical, according to Bitcoin Unlimited’s Rizun, the arguments boil down to a fight over power.“I don’t want to participate in something to give more influence to nChain and Craig Wright,” Rizun said, adding:“It’s not a technical debate, it’s about control.”Meanwhile, Bitcoin SV supporters argue similarly about the other side.“Bitmain and Bitcoin.com working hard to ruin bitcoin,” Calvin Ayre, the CEO of CoinGeek, tweeted.He sees the changes BitcoinABC is hoping to make are dangerous, going as far as to argue in a blog post that one feature being put forth, DSV, which would give the cryptocurrency Augur-like mechanisms, could “enable the network to be halted.”Either way, though, Rizun argues that this level of heated debate shows that bitcoin cash will no longer be able to make the type of upgrades at the speed they used to.“I think what’s happening is bitcoin cash has outgrown the need to have these regular hard forks,” Rizun told CoinDesk. “Because we set this plan in motion, we have this issue now for the first time where regulated hard forks are causing controversy.”Yet, this controversy is affecting the businesses that moved over to bitcoin cash during its split from bitcoin in an effort to pioneer the cheaper, faster payment network they believed was the original intent of Satoshi Nakamoto.Caught in the crossfire of the debate, Money Button’s Charles is just waiting for the controversy to cool – hopefully with only one coin emerging.“The theory of money button is one money, not many. The product is worse in every way if we have to worry about managing different coins at the same time,” Charles said, concluding:“I will happily embrace either side so long as there’s a clear winner.”Bitcoin.com logo via Consensus archives "

Arrived. Oct 10, 2018 at 15:59 UTC Updated Oct 11, 2018 at 12:09 UTC. 
sanders- ...","Oct 10, 2018 at 15:59 UTC","Three years in the making, bitcoin’s first sidechain “Liquid” is now live.","Launched by San Francisco startup Blockstream, Liquid is arguably the most advanced implementation of a technology called sidechains that’s long been a holy grail for bitcoin coders (though what’s being launched today may be a watered-down version of the original “trustless” vision). Still, that doesn’t dilute the capabilities of what the company, founded by bitcoin’s top open-source coders in 2014, has created.Built off of the live blockchain, Liquid will now be used to carry large volumes of transactions at a higher speed for several of bitcoin’s largest companies.A notable milestone, Liquid has been in progress for quite some time. Blockstream first unveiled the idea in 2015, then the sidechain was launched in beta – being put to the test on bitcoin’s main network – last year. Today, however, the network is finally opening up for all of Blockstream’s partners to use for real transactions.Initial users included 23 bitcoin companies, including exchanges, brokers and other institutions, who will help to manage the sidechain, as well as use Liquid to send transactions.The full list includes include Altonomy, Atlantic Financial, Bitbank, Bitfinex, Bitmax, BitMEX, Bitso, BTCBOX, BTSE, Buull Exchange, DGroup, Coinone, Crypto Garage, GOPAX (operated by Streami), Korbit, L2B Global, OKCoin, The Rock Trading, SIX Digital Exchange, Unocoin, Xapo, XBTO and Zaif.With many of bitcoin’s big exchanges on board, the companies make up 50 percent to 60 percent of bitcoin’s trading volume, according to CoinMarketCap.“This will bolster the bitcoin ecosystem because you can trade more securely and rapidly,” Blockstream CSO Samson Mow said in interview.He told CoinDesk:“It’s ready for commercial use. At this point, it’s just a matter of getting exchanges to integrate.”On a more technical level, the product works in a way that’s akin to a kind of digital alchemy.An exchange converts its bitcoin into “LBTC” – the liquid bitcoin token – which is pegged to actual bitcoin. Once sent there, exchanges can move money around securely and much more quickly than on the main bitcoin chain.“If there’s one thing our traders need, it’s speed. Liquid delivers that in spades,” said Paolo Ardoino, CTO of Bitfinex, in a statement. “Liquid’s instant settlements will allow our traders to achieve faster bitcoin deposits and withdrawals, more efficient arbitrage, and even better pricing through tighter spreads.”But, there’s a huge caveat, one that long-time bitcoin enthusiasts are sure not to miss.Liquid is not exactly a “real” sidechain, or at least not the type Blockstream was founded to research and build. Instead of building a sidechain that allows users to swap bitcoins for sidechain coins without a trusted third party, Blockstream built what’s called a “federated sidechain.”Federated sidechains rely on a group of companies – in this case, Blockstream’s launch partners – to collectively manage the sidechain. (A white paper released last year explains in more detail the technicals of the specific type of federated sidechain Liquid uses.)For this reason, critics like pseudonymous bitcoin subreddit moderator ThePiachu have called the tech “not innovative” – even as far back as three years ago. “Liquid looks like a very interesting project, but it’s not the sidechains we are looking for,” the moderator wrote.While this might seem like a catch in the development, for the companies involved it doesn’t matter all that much, since Liquid helps solve more than one problem that’s been bothering them. In addition to moving money faster, partners will also be able to launch tokens on the platform, representing financial instruments, fiat currencies or crypto assets.Mow went as far as to argue that the sidechain works better than the smart contract blockchain ethereum for launching tokens.On top of that, in the coming weeks, Blockstream will be releasing a wallet specifically made for Liquid transactions. Plus, the company’s bitcoin wallet GreenAddress already supports Liquid. Hardware wallet providers Ledger and Trezor have unveiled plans to adopt the technology also.While that sounds like quite the momentum, it’s been a long road for Liquid.“From a high-level view, Blockstream was founded on two-way peg sidechains. So, you could say Liquid is essentially our company purpose. If you look at it that way, it’s been a few years in the making, but actual R&D has been two years,” Mow said.So, why did it take so long for Blockstream to build this?“It’s difficult to launch something like Liquid because it requires security engineering on both software and hardware. It’s not something we want to rush,” Mow contended.This seems to be proven by recent events. As explained in more detail in a recent blog post, Blockstream argued that when they heard about an unconfirmed security breach of major hardware that’s currently rocking the technology world, they shipped their hardware out for an audit – just in case.They’re being picky about their security, Mow said, because they have big plans for the sidechain – that being that the technology could potentially carry a large chunk of bitcoin’s total transactions.Speaking to this, Mow told CoinDesk:“It will potentially be transacting billions of dollars worth of bitcoin a day.”Still, even though the technology is live now, there’s a long way to go before the platform reaches that kind of scale. According to the Blockstream team, they’ll continue to work with exchanges and wallets to integrate Liquid into more platforms.Water chutes image via Shutterstock"

What’s more, a number of ethereum-based projects are also reporting that they will support adoption of the token once released.These include decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges and finance-focused blockchain projects participating as “launch members,” such as MakerDAO, Dharma, Airswap, Gnosis, IDEX, Radar Relay, Compound, DDEX, Hydro Protocol, Set Protocol and Prycto.Aimed at replicating the utility of bitcoin in a way that’s interoperable with ethereum, the “wrapped bitcoin” or WBTC token will facilitate any decentralized application running on the blockchain.Calling it “the best of both worlds,” CTO of BitGo Benedict Chan characterized WBTC as possessing both “the stability of bitcoin and the flexibility of ethereum.”Chan told CoinDesk:“It’s very similar in some ways to how people created banknotes that represented a pound of gold. A pound of gold was heavier and it took longer to trade. You could use a note which represented a pound of gold and it was well accepted.”In the case of WBTC, BitGo is the primary custodian in charge of holding a reserve of bitcoins to back all minted WBTC tokens in circulation on the ethereum blockchain.And unlike other stablecoins pegged to fiat currencies, WBTC tokens will feature a full proof-of-reserves verifiable directly on the two blockchains.“The beauty of that is all we have to do is put up a webpage and show all the addresses that have the bitcoins … and at the same time, people will be able to check how many WBTC are in existence just by looking … on the ethereum blockchain,” said Chan.Apart from a bitcoin custodian, there are also registered “merchants” responsible for disseminating and redeeming WBTC tokens to all users. Currently listed to be the Kyber Network and Republic Protocol, merchants complete transfers of WBTC for bitcoin and vice versa, in the form of atomic swaps.As background, atomic swaps facilitate two-way cryptocurrency trades across different blockchain platforms without any risk of one party defaulting on their end of the agreement.This ensures that for every transfer of WBTC for bitcoin (or the other way around), reserves remain “one-to-one backed and totally verifiable” as highlighted by Chan.The initiative by BitGo, Kyber Network and Republic Protocol is envisioned to be a community-driven effort.Looking to expand services to a growing number of WBTC users, the goal is to eventually onboard several custodians and merchants in the long run.WBTC token dissemination structure. Image courtesy of Kyber Protocol.To this end, Loi Luu, CEO of Kyber Network, emphasized that with the official launch of the WBTC token in January of next year, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) would also be activated and tasked with overseeing the ongoing development of the project.Luu explained told CoinDesk:“One of the main reasons why many projects support this initiative is because there’s a DAO that’s going to govern the whole project including making major upgrades, adding more features, adding more merchants, even adding new custodians as well.”As of now, what remains undetermined is the list of the companies that comprise the DAO, as well as specifications on how DAO members will propose and vote on improvements to the WBTC token.Expected to be publicized on code-sharing platform GitHub at a later date, Luu affirmed that decentralized leadership would be a key component to the success of the WBTC token.“I think it couldn’t be that successful if the initiative is owned by Bitgo or by Kyber [Network] or Republic [Protocol] alone,” said Luu.New shiny Bitcoin laying on a pile of old euro cent copper coins image via Shutterstock"

The developers ...","Oct 2, 2018 at 20:05 UTC",A severe bug discovered just weeks ago in bitcoin’s code has been exploited – albeit on a lesser-known cryptocurrency.,"The developers behind the pigeoncoin cryptocurrency confirmed the exploit to CoinDesk on Tuesday, reporting that an unknown attacker successfully took advantage of the bug on September 26th, showcasing in the wild how it could have been used on bitcoin by printing 235 million coins worth about $15,000.That’s because while the severe inflation bug was patched on bitcoin, other coins that have borrowed bitcoin’s public code over the years are still vulnerable (if they haven’t corrected their code). If exploited, the bug gives an attacker the ability to print as many coins as they want, going even above the hard-coded limitations on supply cryptocurrencies often have and decreasing the value of all the other coins investors hold.Set apart by its X16r mining algorithm, pigeoncoin is not exactly a big cryptocurrency, not even ranking in the top 1,000 in terms of how valuable it is compared to others on CoinMarketCap. Still, the attack may be no less impactful on its efforts to use a blockchain to “end abusive data collection.”With a total supply of 970 million pigeoncoins, the attacker was able to print an amount equal to one-fourth of all publicly traded pigeoncoins, prompting one of the only exchanges to support the currency, CryptoBridge, to temporarily suspend trading while developers moved to enact a fix.After the inflation was detected, developers of the coin quickly released a software fix borrowing from the code bitcoin developers put out a couple of weeks ago. “Pools and exchanges must upgrade immediately to resolve a double-spend exploit derived from bitcoin source,” the notes for the fix explain.But while users might not particularly care about what happens to the little-known coin, the exploit has wider implications for the cryptocurrency world.Cryptocurrency developer Scott Roberts argued that the main takeaway from this event is that the bitcoin bug was really as bad as it sounded:“Mainly it’s just nice to know for sure by this example that coins in the wild were really vulnerable. It was not just some vague theoretical problem.”Now the bug is fixed, observers are wondering what the attacker will do and whether he or she will successful be able to trade their gains for fiat money. In order to do so, the attacker most likely will need to convert their pigeoncoin into another cryptocurrency that’s more widely accepted.“Many of us are now waiting to see what happens with the hacked coins and if there’s going to be a dump soon,” pigeoncoin developer Michael Oates told CoinDesk.The community is following the events closely in the pigeoncoin Discord chat channel. “My guess is the funds won’t move for a few days. It would be stupid to try and move them all at once,” Oates added on Discord.The other big concern is, if pigeoncoin was attacked, what about other coins that have cloned bitcoin’s code?“It would be interesting to see how many coins suffered an attack due to [the] bug,” Roberts told CoinDesk, adding that pigeoncoin is the only one he knows has been exploited so far.Still, Roberts added that many cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin gold and litecoin, have now upgraded, so hopefully the same attack won’t be executed on other coins.He concluded:“It looks like most coins have already updated, so it’s not likely to be a problem.”Pigeon image via Shutterstock"

From a technical perspective, the relationship BTC has with traditional charting patterns is occasionally counter-intuitive to what one would normally expect. Take, for example, the descending triangle which is typically bearish in nature.While it does contain the prospect for breaking either way, the repeated failed (bearish) descending triangle breakdowns over the course of bitcoin’s life cycle, leaves an unanswered question, are we viewing these patterns the wrong way? And if so what makes this year different?Bitcoin’s relationship with the 200-day moving average (DMA) and descending triangle pattern has been significant.Descending triangles are measured by connecting a series of lower highs, usually angled at 45 degrees and breaking down left to right thus creating a primary trendline. The secondary baseline connects two or more of the lowest lows in a series to form the horizontal ‘floor’. What you end up with is a descending triangle pattern that demonstrates a gradual loss of confidence in the asset you are looking at.When the patterns and indicators are combined on bitcoin’s weekly chart they show a consistent counter-play to their traditional bearish norms. As can be seen, price generally breaks bullish from the formation instead of continuing to lower supports as it normally should.The only other time bitcoin broke down from the descending triangle was back in March 2014. Post-breakdown, the bulls managed a short-term rally before being rejected by the 200-DMA, which held price under for 1.2 years.It’s clear that the price of bitcoin being under the 200 DMA firmly establishes the market as bearish, and this time around is no exception. That said, history would suggest an upside break of the current descending triangle may be on the cards soon, and that could initiate a move above the DMA as a sign of a larger trend reversal. While it does offer insights into the relationship bitcoin has with the 200-DMA, it is key to remember that the patterns also vary in scope and size, which is usually telling of the price action that follows.So, based off the previous 1.2 year bear run, it’s possible bitcoin could turn bullish by early next year, especially if all fundamentals are taken into account, as suggested by CNBC cryptotrader, Ran Nuener.On the flipside, bitcoin has been staring down a bear market for the last 7 months and has dropped below the significant 200-DMA beginning Feb. 5.Traditional patterns such as descending triangles are still worth viewing in bearish terms since the onset rush from 2017/18 was unprecedented and the subsequent sell-off that followed has seen bitcoin drop 67 percent to date from its all-time-high in December 2017.As stated earlier, price falling below the 200 DMA has proven to be a sign the market has officially turned bearish. A bearish trend combined with a bearish price pattern, the descending triangle, creates an ideal technical set up for further depreciation even though bitcoin tends to negate the bear view. If price does break down as it technically should, there is a prior resistance and support zone in the $4,900 to $5,400 that may once again offer support to the falling price. If price breaks up as it historically should, the nearby lower highs need to be surpassed on the higher time frames in order to prove a bearish to bullish trend change is in order. The first lower high that price needs to find acceptance above is near $6,850 (differs among exchanges dealing in USDT), while the next is closer to $7,400.Disclosure: The authors hold USDT at the time of writing.Candlestick chart image via Shutterstock; charts by Trading View"

Mining pools Bitcoin.com, BTC.com and Antpool have controlled the ABC action to date.As of press time, Bitcoin ABC is 10 blocks ahead of Bitcoin SV, according to data compiled by Coin Dance.Thus far, most blocks mined on the Bitcoin ABC network have featured over 1,000 transactions, though starting at 20:48 UTC a significant drop in both block size and transaction count was recorded on blockchain explorer site Blockchair.A few hours before hard fork activation, mining pools purporting to support the Bitcoin SV roadmap controlled a supermajority of the bitcoin cash network. However, according to bitcoin cash monitoring site CoinDance, Bitcoin ABC is now leading in terms of total hash power support.One such example that received high attention over the course of today’s events was mining pool Bitcoin.com, which released an announcement to users saying all hash power going into mining the bitcoin blockchain would be temporarily deployed to mine Bitcoin ABC blocks.Though this announcement received negative feedback from those who claimed the organization had no legal right to redirect mining support in this way, data on the site indicates that starting at 17:30 UTC the mining pool has steadily been reallocating hash power in support of the Bitcoin ABC blockchain.In fact, as of press time, bitcoin.com purports that a total of 4218.89 Ph/s of hash power is being used to mine blocks on the Bitcoin ABC network; just one day prior that figure sat at roughly 240.00 Ph/s.As might be expected, the existence of two bitcoin cash chains leaves many questions, primarily regarding what will transpire in the days that come – and whether one chain ultimately gives way to another.There was also an event Thursday that left lingering questions: as shown by blockchain explorer BlockDozer, a major spike in activity occurred within minutes of the chain split.Who caused this spike in transaction activity – and for what purpose – remains unknown at this time, though the potential for another spam attack in efforts to overload either network is an ongoing possibility.What’s more, wild fluctuations in bitcoin cash price were also seen throughout the day across different cryptocurrency exchanges.Depending on ongoing hash power support and implementation of either software upgrade from users, prices could continue to see swings – but given the uniqueness of the scenario, it’s difficult to say at this time.According to numbers on crypto exchange Poloniex, the comparative value estimated of both bitcoin cash cryptocurrencies is currently about $94 for Bitcoin SV and $285 for Bitcoin ABC.David Floyd contributed reporting.Bitcoin Cash image via Shutterstock "

during the previous decade. While my family and I adored living ...","Sep 10, 2018 at 08:00 UTC",Michael J. Casey is the chairman of CoinDesk’s advisory board and a senior advisor for blockchain research at MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative.,"The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers.When people ask me what got me into bitcoin, I often answer with one word: “Argentina. ”Amid the sad news that the South American country is again gripped by a currency crisis, I’m getting a strong reminder of that connection.Below, I explain it and explore one crypto team’s proposal for the Argentine government to overcome this latest meltdown with a stability-seeking strategy that partly includes bitcoin.Over the past 30 years, Argentina has tried a diverse toolkit of mainstream economic solutions to its persistent drift into chaos, and each has failed. Perhaps a new, outside-the-box, crypto-friendly approach is needed. And with other emerging-market countries now suffering “contagion” from Argentina’s, Turkey’s and other developing countries’ woes, maybe there’s a lesson for the wider world too.My Argentina-bitcoin connection stems from six years spent in Buenos Aires during the previous decade. While my family and I adored living there, we had a tortured, love-hate relationship with the country.On the plus side, in addition to its great food, wine and culture, we made some of the best, most loving, loyal friends we’ve ever made in our adult lives in Argentina.On the negative side: broken civil institutions and a history of corrupt governments ensured that a dysfunctional economy would repeatedly, almost inevitably, drift toward monetary crises. This stoked inflation and bred uncertainty, making it increasingly difficult to make economic plans.Eventually, the latter problem forced us to leave. We wanted our kids to grow up in a society that offered greater long-term opportunities. Even after we’d made the decision to go, Argentina’s dysfunction almost destroyed us financially, when we struggled to get our life savings out of the country — as readers of Paul Vigna’s and my first book, The Age of Cryptocurrency, will know.What does all this have to do with bitcoin? Well, it starts with the core social problem of trust, which, in essence, cryptocurrencies and blockchains strive to resolve with their unique, decentralized approach to recordkeeping and value exchange.Both the positives and the negatives of our Argentine experience stem from this trust challenge. In Argentina, as with other societies with notoriously corrupt or failed institutions, strong personal bonds of trust are forged among family and friends because they provide a social safety net to help you secure your property and well-being against a wider system that can’t be trusted to protect them.What’s lacking is a lasting social covenant between citizens and institutions of government, the kind that, in more functional economies, breeds the former’s trust in the latter. (Be warned, Americans, that covenant is not guaranteed forever. It can be destroyed.) It becomes entirely expected that government officials will rob the public purse. As a result, tax avoidance and graft are normalized and entrenched.The ultimate measure of whether a society enjoys such a covenant is the stability of its fiat currency, whose value will evaporate if users don’t trust the government not to debase it in pursuit of its own interests. This is the core story of Argentina, whose habit of succumbing to a crisis every ten or so years has over time taken this resource-rich country from being one of the world’s wealthiest at the start of the 20th century to a byword for economic dysfunction.Note: this is not per se a commentary on the government of President Mauricio Macri, which has, in my mind, pursued some of the more sensible policies of any in recent decades and has avoided turning the peso’s printing presses into a funding vehicle. The problem is that even the most well-intended, honest shooter of a president will struggle against this ingrained structure of mistrust and corruption.So, with all of that as a relatively fresh experience, bitcoin came as a revelation when I finally grasped its central promise in 2013.What if Argentines could outsource the record-keeping system underpinning their payments and value exchanges to a decentralized network that’s controlled not by mistrusted human institutions but by a common, censorship-resistant, math-driven protocol?What if the teeming poor who fill the ever-growing shantytowns on the outskirts of Buenos Aires had a more trustworthy system for recording and monetizing their assets and identities?What if a digital currency that’s easily available for electronic, cross-border transactions became these people’s go-to means of storing wealth, rather than greenbacks stored in hidden safety deposit boxes that can’t be easily moved offshore?It turned out I wasn’t alone in thinking this way. Early bitcoin thought leaders such as Wences Casares and Andreas Antonopoulos were already articulating how cryptocurrencies would appeal to people in places with failed economic systems.Their predictions have steadily played out. Argentina has become a hotbed of crypto development. Venezuela’s mining rigs are now legendary. And lately Turkey has seen a surge in demand for bitcoin.But what if it wasn’t just private citizens turning to this technology as a fix, but governments?Enter Santiago Siri, a San Francisco-based blockchain technology enthusiast who’s best known for his work developing the voting platform Democracy Earth. Siri’s heading back to his native Argentina later this month with a proposal for Luis Caputo, the President of Argentina’s Central Bank.His idea, announced in a tweet (in Spanish) last month, is that the central bank place up to one percent of its national reserves in bitcoin. It’s a modest idea, but with potentially significant ramifications.Because of its focus on reserves, which developing countries use as a buffer to help stabilize their currencies, it might be tempting to compare this strategy to Argentina’s past dollar-focused models, including the infamous “convertibility plan” of the 1990s. Under that model, the Argentine peso was rigidly pegged one-to-one to the dollar via a constitutional commitment to hold at least the equivalent value of its money supply in U.S. currency reserves.This “currency board” arrangement worked well for a few years. However, its fatal flaw — the misalignment of Argentina’s and the United States’ economic interests — was exposed when the U.S. Federal Reserve began aggressively hiking interest rates at the worst possible time for Argentina’s then-slowing economy.The local currency became heavily overvalued relative to its economic health — ultimately, unsustainably so. The peg broke, essentially bankrupting the country, and setting forth a pendulum swing that took the country from a heavily deflationary environment to the unsustainable inflationary situation of the present.Siri’s proposal has no such extreme pegging concepts behind it. It would simply add more diversity to the central bank’s reserves. But by exposing some of the nation’s official reserve holdings to a cryptocurrency that many of its people are increasingly holding, and shifting some of it away from U.S. policy-dependent dollars, there would, in effect, be a modest aligning of interests. Siri also suggests the government use some its large nuclear power capacity to engage in state-owned bitcoin mining to cheaply expand its reserves.As modest as it, a nod toward bitcoin of this kind could be meaningful for the country, signaling support for financial innovation and for decentralized models that reinforce public confidence.And while the downside of price volatility is limited by the one-percent cap, the upside financial boost could be significant if, as Siri expects, bitcoin rallies when foreign governments start abandoning dollars in the midst of a mounting global trade war.Putting one percent of its reserves in bitcoin, Siri estimates, would leave the country holding a hefty 0.5 percent of the total float for the cryptocurrency, giving it “first mover” advantages.The proposal raises as many challenging questions as it answers, including how ownership of the nation’s private keys will be defined. (Siri has flagged the idea of the presidency and the central bank sharing a multi-sig wallet.) He is also proposing changes to Argentine law, including to custodianship rules and those dealing with the tax treatment of crypto.A move of this kind would be a noteworthy departure from the fiat-centric orthodoxy of traditional economists. But for a country that has tried these experts’ prescriptions from across the spectrum of economic beliefs, maybe it’s time to look outside the mainstream.Argentine banknotes image via Shutterstock"

blockchain by market cap, and other smart contract protocols, have been ...","Oct 7, 2018 at 10:30 UTC","By the end of the year, an initial coin offering, or ICO, will be launched on bitcoin.","You heard that right – on bitcoin.While ethereum, the second largest blockchain by market cap, and other smart contract protocols, have been the choice for the majority of entrepreneurs interested in creating new crypto tokens, with a sidechain created by RSK, bitcoin will now have the ability to host the new fundraising mechanism as well.In fact, the original concept of an ICO was first started on the bitcoin blockchain itself back in 2013 – though with comparatively limited blockchain infrastructure to that of ethereum today – by self-proclaimed inventor of the idea,  J.R. Willett, who raised a total of half a million dollars for the token “mastercoin,” later renamed to omni.And sometime in late November, Temco, a South Korea-based blockchain startup targeting supply chain management, will take advantage of both the seminal idea and RSK’s technology, launching a public token sale with the goal of raising $19 million.Stepping back, RSK has been working on its Turing-complete smart contract sidechain for bitcoin since early 2016. The smart contracts are written in the same dominant language as ethereum – that being Solidity. And the network is fueled by a bitcoin-pegged cryptocurrency dubbed “smart bitcoin,” or SBTC.Still in beta, only a handful of crypto projects are deploying smart contracts on the RSK sidechain currently.However, given time, Temco’s CEO Scott Yoon and head of business development Joey Cho said they believe bitcoin will soon attract a greater number of blockchain projects and one day have “the same function like ethereum.”Yoon is adamant that bitcoin possesses the potential to become much more than “just payment cryptocurrency,” seeing the upcoming launch of Temco’s ICO as indicative of this.Speaking to CoinDesk, Yoon said:“RSK … will be dominating [the smart contract] ecosystem and [for] bitcoin that will open another era of bitcoin, like ethereum.”Temco’s crypto token will be used for a variety of different purposes.The startup’s main interest is in giving small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) the ability to track products throughout the supply chain, from its origin to its final consumption – a hot use case for the nascent technology today.According to many enthusiasts, a blockchain will give businesses a cost-efficient and immutable method for storing supply chain data.In Temco’s case, the token will be used by both vendors and consumers for things like payment for products, storage of data and subscription to business intelligence tools.In addition, consumers will be awarded points – later converted into these tokens – for general participation, such as tracking their purchases from data stored on the blockchain and reviewing these purchases to ensure product quality, in the ecosystem.This blockchain architecture, as Cho explains, is an important tool for SMEs that can offer “better insight, better operating system [and] better planning” at minimal overhead costs to vendors without a pre-established infrastructure to monitor product movements.As such, Cho expects about 40 percent of the money to build the infrastructure to come from the public token sale. The rest of the money needed will be raised in private investment deals – one of which was recently announced: South Korea’s largest venture capital firm, Korea Investment Partners invested an undisclosed amount into the company.The public sale, which will accept both bitcoin and ether, will be available to investors around the globe, with the exception of people in China and the U.S.Pointing to “legal risk,” Yoon explained that regulation surrounding token sales in these two countries are either met with hostility (such as China) or is in the process of being fully fleshed out (such as the United States).All of these details about the upcoming Temco ICO are really no different than if the sale were being conducted on ethereum instead.They function in exactly the same way, for the same purposes of raising initial funds from the public through a highly fast-moving and largely unregulated fundraising vehicle.The difference, in the eyes of both Yoon and Cho, is that other blockchains, including ethereum, cannot sustain the creation of “real products” for mass adoption like bitcoin can.Cho explains, “We believe RSK is one of the best blockchain technology because … if we create our supply chain on top of let’s say ethereum … number one the gas fee is amazingly expensive…which is not ideal for the Temco supply chain since we use lots of smart contract transactions.”Adding to this, Cho also highlighted that the transactions per second (TPS) speed of the RSK sidechain was on par to that of online payments giant, like PayPal.Reiterating these sentiments, Yoon added:“Bitcoin network is really ideal because scalability is number one and you don’t have to worry about hacking. So when smart contract tool is brought to the bitcoin network … everybody’s going to want to come to bitcoin.”For these reasons, Yoon and Cho anticipate that one day token projects will choose to launch on bitcoin from the get-go and even ethereum-based token issuers will migrate to bitcoin for RSK’s features.However, at present, the RSK sidechain is still in development.Having launched the beta version in January, the platform is currently only accessible to a select group of developers, business partners and bitcoin miners. And it’s currently run by a collective group of blockchain companies, dubbed the “federation,” who oversee the value being moved on- and off-chain.But there are plans not only to open up the sidechain to anyone and everyone but also to decentralize the federation somewhat.Having secured a reported 80 percent of all bitcoin miner support, RSK announced in May that it was looking to implement significant upgrades that would address the very same scalability issues being tackled by many of the world’s biggest blockchains today.And Yoon, for one, is optimistic about the promise of smart contracts and blockchains, especially bitcoin to become much more than just what it’s used for today.Speaking to this, he concluded:“The reason why we started Temco was we want to see a real blockchain technology actually implementing in the real world and change the society for the better.”RSK image via Consensus archives "

First and foremost, Blockstream co-founder Mark Friedenbach recently found that the exploit could be harnessed to help bitcoin scale – that is, reach more users and process more transactions faster, if developers embrace and implement the idea.But since its unveiling last week, the discovery has driven a shift in the conversation around the attack, meant to describe how miners might submit blocks featuring timestamps that are larger than they should be to push down the difficulty of creating new blocks (a trick that could help them to earn and collect more bitcoin rewards).The result is that prominent thinkers in the bitcoin development community now appear split on an issue that’s been the subject of discussion since 2012..Greg Maxwell, a Blockstream co-founder and one of bitcoin’s most prominent developers, for example, recently called for a fix to the long-standing bitcoin attack on the bitcoin mailing list, the leading gathering point for development conversation globally. Maxwell has been silent on Friedenbach’s proposal specifically, but the call did occur after chatter began about the research, formally called “forward blocks.”As a result, this divide might be likely to continue.Friedenbach’s research, after all, proposes an idea that developers seeking to secure the protocol find enticing: It allows bitcoin’s block size to be increased without asking all of those operating the software to upgrade. (Seeing as this minor parameter has been a hot point of contention among the community for so long, some see it as a sort of “breakthrough.”)That said, some argue Friedenbach’s new research makes fixing the attack even more pressing.To begin, however, it helps to understand why the attack exists to begin with.Individual actors (miners) on the network report the time an event happens – when a transaction was made or when a block was created. So, there’s a small chance someone can manipulate the time a little bit, even while following the rules of the bitcoin code that network nodes are constantly checking.As such, miners report blocks with the wrong time on occasion. It’s easy to tell because every once in a while, a block rolls in with a timestamp that’s earlier than the block before it (essentially appearing out of order).To explore why this happens, blockchain analysis company Chainalysis recently pulled together a report exploring how the error rates have changed over time.“The declining error over time in timestamps reflects the evolution of people getting involved,” Gradwell, who co-authored the report, told CoinDesk, arguing that according to the data, timestamp errors seem to “spike” when the mining industry sees a technology shift.For example, when miners started joining together to form “pools” early on in 2012 the percentage of timestamp errors rose to 8 percent of timestamps.Gradwell argues that this data suggests the errors are accidental, rather than done for malicious reasons, as miners need to get used to new equipment.The timewarp “attack” is a bit different, though, in that it requires much more specific manipulation by miners who twist the rules in the hopes of earning money. This can happen when miners collude together to report incorrect timestamps that are farther apart, messing with the rate at which blocks can be mined.Luckily, this attack is difficult to execute.“I, and I assume others, haven’t put a big priority into fixing this vulnerability because it requires a majority [of mining] hashrate and could easily be blocked if someone started using it,” Maxwell said.In the case where one group of miners were to collect most of the hashrate, a time attack would be the least of bitcoin’s worries. (“And then there will be other problems,” as Chainalysis chief economist Philip Gradwell put it in conversation with CoinDesk.)For one, it would mean centralization of the network. And the main thing that is supposed to set bitcoin apart from other cryptocurrencies is that it isn’t controlled by any one entity. Not to mention, at this point, the miners in power would be able to perform what’s known as a “51 percent attack,” thereby using their numbers to exert influence over the network.But even if it’s difficult to execute, developers see it as a problem, one that can be fixed easily if so desired.In his call for proposals, Maxwell mentioned that he had an idea that he tried out on bitcoin’s testnet years ago, but he wants to make sure there isn’t some other, better idea out there before plugging away at his fix.“Before I dust off my old fix and perhaps prematurely cause fixation on a particular approach, I thought it would be useful to ask the list if anyone else was aware of a favorite backwards compatible timewarp fix proposal they wanted to point out,” Maxwell continued.“Backwards compatible” is key here. The requirement is for the change to not have a chance of splitting the network.At Maxwell’s request, a few different proposals have trickled in.Bitcoin Core contributor Johnson Lau put forward a couple of ideas, both good and bad, to show the tradeoffs of various approaches. He argued that the most “naive” approach would be to just require a block to not submit a time lower than the block before it.But since this would require a certain type of change, it could lead bitcoin’s software to split into two versions. Lau argues the trick is finding a solution that decreases the likelihood of a timewarp attack, while also not risking a split.“The aim is to find a [time value] which is small-enough-to-prohibit-time-warp-attack, but also big-enough-to-avoid-split,” he said, adding that he thinks this can be accomplished with a “weaker” version of this naive approach.Lau’s idea even sparked a little philosophical discussion about “soft forks,” a backwards-compatible way of making such a code change in bitcoin, and how different types can have different consequences.“In general, soft forks are better when they don’t cause orphaning on non-upgraded miners,” wrote BitTorrent creator Bram Cohen, who’s been focusing his developer efforts on cryptocurrency these days.All in all, though, he supported Lau’s proposal, but argued for a time window of three hours. “It suffers from still allowing the attack a little bit, but three hours out of every two weeks seems like no big deal,” Cohen said.Another developer, Scott Roberts, submitted a proposal that turned out to not be “off the mark” for bitcoin in particular, he told CoinDesk. In the end, he agrees with Cohen, though he thinks three hours might be “too tight.”“I don’t know what the decision will be, but I think the fix is as simple as limiting timestamps to plus or minus something like three to 24 hours from the previous timestamp,” Roberts said.But the problem is that eradicating the time warp attack would ruin forward blocks.“‘Fixing’ the time-warp attack in the sense of making time warp impossible would prevent entirely forward blocks from achieving on-chain scaling. It might still be worth deploying for the proof-of-work upgrade or increase censorship resistance of sharding,” Friedenbach told CoinDesk, adding:“But the main advantage [of scaling bitcoin] which excites people would be gone.”Thinking about this, Friedenbach came up with another proposal, one that would preserve forward blocks, but would expunge the “worst exploits” of the timewarp attack. He went on to argue it “could be deployed early to prevent reckless exploitation of the time-warp bug,” he added.But many bitcoin technologists seem unsure that pure forward blocks are worth preserving.Blockstream CEO Adam Back argues that while he thinks it’s interesting research, he’s not sure the community would support it.“I think it’s useful to explore the technical possibilities, which is what Mark has done. But the main limitation is, will there be consensus for making a big tradeoff of decentralization, censorship-resistance and self-validation cost for brute-force layer1 scale,” Back told CoinDesk.While forward blocks are interesting because they increase bitcoin’s capacity without a hard fork, a type of change that could split bitcoin in two, it’s still forceful.And since forcing through a change that not everyone wants and could decrease decentralization was a key reason why the community fought so zealously in bitcoin’s years-long scaling debate, Back argues the community wouldn’t take this type of a change lightly either.He went as far as to argue that “there are likely simpler, less hacky approaches” than Friedenbach’s to boost bitcoin’s layer-one scale.With this type of criticism still rolling in, it seems to be an ongoing discussion, as Friedenbach continues to argue forward blocks are worth preserving as a tool:“The dangerous outcomes of the time-warp bug can be prevented without fixing the bug entirely, and therefore without blocking off forward blocks or related scaling solutions.”Clock photo by Srikanta H.

27,www.coindesk.com,"Sep 18, 2018",Palestinians Are Using Bitcoin to Transact Across Borders ...,https://www.coindesk.com/crypto-gaza-west-bank-bitcoin-palestine,"For a small but growing community of users in the Palestinian territories 
of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, bitcoin has become a lifeline.","Sep 18, 2018 at 04:03 UTC","For a small but growing community of users in the Palestinian territories of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, bitcoin has become a lifeline.","Ahmed Ismail, a financial analyst in Gaza, estimated there are at least 20 unofficial “exchange” offices there dealing cryptocurrency to local users. Ismail himself helps 30 clients use bitcoin to purchase investments abroad, such as stocks, since there aren’t any local alternatives for putting money to work.One such currency dealer in Gaza, Mohammed, told CoinDesk over the past four years he helped up to 50 families a month purchase an average of $500 worth of bitcoin each to send money abroad or shop online.“Bitcoin, in their opinion, is cheaper, safer, and quicker,” he said. “Nothing works with Palestinian banks. Bitcoin wallets are alternative banks.”While Palestine is not the only politically and economically isolated part of the world where cryptocurrency is making inroads, it’s somewhat unique among these markets in terms of the drivers – and limitations – to adoption.For example, Palestinians do not face the kind of hyperinflation that drives Venezuelans, Iranians and Turks to hodl a digital currency with a limited supply, since they don’t have a national currency at all, instead using stable foreign currencies.But another core property of public blockchain networks is particularly appealing in the Palestinian territories: censorship-resistance.Anyone can conduct a peer-to-peer bitcoin transaction. Once the transaction is paid for, it can’t be vetoed by an intermediary. This would appear to solve a real problem for a population with restricted access to the global economy amid the ongoing conflict with Israel. Even supporters in the West have had their bank accounts shut down for sending money to Palestinians.“There is no payment gateway, like PayPal, for entrepreneurs to receive payments internationally,” Laith Kassis, CEO of the nonprofit Palestine Techno Park in the West Bank, told CoinDesk. “So here comes solutions on blockchain with private nodes.”(The local alternative, PalPay, predominantly serves Bank of Palestine customers rather than offering a gateway to global commerce.)However, an electronic currency can only do so much in a place where power outages can be a daily occurrence and even traditional banks sometimes struggle to transact with much of the outside world.While sending or receiving bitcoin may be frictionless, on- and off-ramps just don’t exist in the Palestinian territories.There’s no way for Palestinians to get their Israeli shekels, U.S. dollars or Jordanian dinars to online crypto exchanges since none of them work with local banks. Hence, they must rely on dealers as liquidity gateways, and that adds friction back in.One Palestinian tech worker told CoinDesk that when she tried to cash out a bitcoin payment from a remote employer, she couldn’t get a fair fiat price from dealers in Gaza because crypto prices were soaring at the time.As such, Saifdean Ammous, the Palestinian-born author of “The Bitcoin Standard,” is skeptical about any claims that the cryptocurrency currently offers a solution to his homeland’s economic straits.“If the people who want to do the transaction don’t both have balances in bitcoin then you’re just adding extra layers of conversion from their home currency to bitcoin and back to the home currency,” said Ammous, who is a professor of economics at the Lebanese American University. “That’s never going to be a sustainable solution.”Another non-starter, in his view, is the Palestinian Monetary Authority‘s publicly touted plans to create a national cryptocurrency. Ammous said it “completely misses the point to think of bitcoin as a payment solution that can be added onto existing monetary systems.”He added:“Rather, it [bitcoin] is its own monetary system and it will have its own payment solutions.”Plus, Palestinian communities revolve around local trust networks and physical assets like cash, because high unemployment and poverty rates create urgent daily needs. According to World Bank estimates, 21 percent of Palestinians live below the poverty line on less than $5.50 a day.In that context, volatile and illiquid assets are predominately useful for cross-border transactions, but not everyday ones.On the other hand, tech industry optimists like Kassis take a different approach than Ammous or Ismail by engaging with the PMA.Kassis’s Techno Park hosted its first blockchain boot camp the first week of September, with 29 participants ranging from students to entrepreneurs and government officials. By the end of the five-day technical boot camp, several developers were working on new applications. Representatives of the PMA have participated in the center’s educational programming.“The whole ethos of decentralized ledgers plays into the [Palestinian] community’s need to talk peer-to-peer, that will enable Palestinian entrepreneurs to do business internationally,” Kassis said, adding:“I think blockchain and fintech has a huge potential to change the dynamics of our economy and solve many of the financial constraints [by] leveraging the decentralization of the network.”Kassis said he hopes upcoming programs like the Techno Park crypto hackathon later this year will leverage Diaspora connections to foster local expertise for institutional payment solutions.So far, the Techno Park’s blockchain seminars at four universities across the West Bank have discussed government-sponsored pilots, enterprise crypto services provided by companies like Ripple, and initial coin offerings, in addition to bitcoin.“It’s all about bringing awareness and creating new markets,” Kassis said. “The younger generation is more knowledgeable about crypto, more than the IT departments at banks.”And even if it’s too soon for bitcoin to make much difference now, Ammous said he believes that in the long term it has great potential to spark societal change.Ammous argues that governments, including those in the Middle East, have been able to fund destructive ideas, such as wars, precisely because of their ability to issue unbacked fiat via central banks.“The key thing is that the more it [bitcoin] grows, the more it will deprive governments of the ability to print more money,” Ammous said, concluding:“I think, in the long run, this is going to be a very good thing for everywhere in the world, particularly places in the Middle East.”Palestine image by Dominika Zarzycka; Shutterstock"

with a key volatility indicator reaching its lowest level for 21 months.","Sep 26, 2018 at 11:11 UTC","A three-month long bitcoin price squeeze (BTC) could be nearing an end, with a key volatility indicator reaching its lowest level for 21 months.","The leading cryptocurrency has charted lower price highs and lower price lows (pennant) since the end of June and the lack of strong direction bias has both bulls and the bears waiting on the sidelines.As a result, volatility as represented by Bollinger bands width – a technical analysis tool derived from +2, -2 standard deviations of a price’s moving average – has hit the lowest level since December 2016. When measured by standard deviation across all exchanges, volatility is at the lowest since July 2017, according to Bitcoinity.It is worth noting that an extended period of low volatility usually paves way for a strong directional bias, meaning bitcoin could soon witness a big move in either direction.At press time, BTC is trading at $6,490 on Bitfinex.Over on the daily chart, BTC is trapped in a pennant pattern. As of writing, the top edge (resistance) of the pennant is located at $6,900 and the lower edge (support) is seen at $6,270.The Bollinger bandwidth (gap between Bollinger bands divided by 20-day moving average) has dropped to a 21-month low of 0.0975 today. Further, the oscillator is showing that volatility has steadily declined over the last nine months.So, it seems safe to say that a spike in volatility (big move in prices) is overdue and going by the moving average studies on the long-term charts, it could happen on the downside, that is, the pennant support could be breached.The 5-period and 10-period exponential moving averages (MAs) have produced a bearish crossover on the monthly chart for the first time since the second half of 2014. More importantly, the bearish cross has gained more credence, courtesy of BTC’s drop from the weekend high of $6,841 to the previous day’s low of $6,325.Over on the hourly chart, BTC is struggling to pick up a bid despite the bullish divergence of the relative strength index (RSI) and an inverse head-and-shoulders breakout. All of which indicates that bearish sentiment is quite strong.Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.Bitcoin image via Shutterstock; Charts by Trading View"

“ ...","Oct 14, 2018 at 11:59 UTC","Volatile price swings and plummeting valuations have been a reality for bitcoin investors of late, but those who own traditional equities haven’t been immune either.","In fact, bitcoin and the S&P have correlated on and off for almost a year, each taking turns as the leading indicator. Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency advertised as digital gold due to its difficult means of production and limited supply, is expected by some to act as a “safe haven asset,” one that rises or remains stable in times of economic turmoil (just as its metal companion traditionally has). To date, though, rarely has that been the case. Since Oct. 10, both bitcoin and equities markets have taken a notable plunge, and interestingly enough, to around the same degree. The S&P 500, the benchmark for equities worldwide, at its lowest point of the day of $2,710 market a 5.69 percent loss from the opening price of the day prior. Similarly, bitcoin’s low yesterday of $6,205 marks a similar 6.7 percent depreciation from the opening prices two days ago, according to data from Binance. The respective performances suggest bitcoin is behaving like a risk asset rather than a safe haven alternative – a claim backed up by their technical charts.The daily chart comparison between the S&P 500 Index (SPX) and BTC shows a similar correlation in price action and direction, with a notable dip in both markets in September and October. It has often been the case that as bitcoin gains in value, so too does the SPX, and vice versa, providing an indication on the status of investor sentiment worldwide.Observing the end of September for bitcoin, we see how prices peaked and sharply fell as the month of October rolled around, the SPX also retraced around the same time. The first indications for bitcoin’s most recent breakdown appeared on the SPX on Oct. 4-5, demonstrated by the peak in price and a bearish 3-candlestick breakdown that triggered a sharp sell-off. Bitcoin followed suit a day later after printing a similar bearish candlestick on both charts.So, for now, it seems as though the SPX is providing signals for the bitcoin market a day or so in advance. Risky assets are the ones that have a significant degree of price volatility and do not offer fixed returns. Further, the prices of these assets tend to rise when the domestic and global economy is growing. For instance, stock markets do not offer a guaranteed return and usually rally when the economy is doing well and vice versa.On similar lines, emerging market currencies, base metals and oil are risky assets, which closely follow the action in the major stock exchanges across the globe.BTC does share some of the properties of the risky assets. For instance, there are no fixed returns in the bitcoin market and historically, it’s been highly volatile. More importantly, it is closely following the stock markets. So, it is safe to conclude that BTC is currently being treated as risk assets by some investors.The leading cryptocurrency will likely start behaving like a classic safe haven asset after its adoption rates have increased significantly.Disclosure: The authors hold USDT, BTC, AST, REQ, OMG, FUEL, 1st and AMP at the time of writing.Newspaper image via Shutterstock; charts via TradingView"

Earlier this year, a crypto enthusiast won $50,000 worth of bitcoin by solving a puzzle in a painting called “The Legend of Satoshi Nakamoto” by visual artist turned blockchain developer Marguerite deCourcelle.Similar to the 310 BTC Bitcoin Challenge, enticing users to find bounties of bitcoin concealed within a computer-generated image, one of Driscoll’s puzzles took more than two years to solve.For Pip, the game, which debuted on October 2, was an experiment, he said, created “to make someone else happy.” Pip claims to have amassed “a treasure chest” of bitcoin largely for free as an early adopter.His puzzle, though, is already near completion. In fact, within eight days of the challenge being released, three of the four wallets were successfully unlocked and emptied – this including the grand prize allotment of 310 BTC.Shocked at how quickly the funds were moved, Pip posted on Reddit, “I’m very surprised and impressed at the same time. For my next challenge, I can clearly beef up overall complexity.”The web page reports over 400 registered participants – and counting. While the majority of staked funds have been claimed, the challenge is ongoing with one final wallet containing 0.31 BTC, around $2,000, yet to be unlocked.As such, active discussions among interested parties on not only Reddit but other public channels such as Discord and BitcoinTalk posit different techniques to uncover the remaining secrets hidden in the PNG file.To crack the code, participants will require a combination of different skills including image manipulation, bytecode manipulation, text encoding and cryptography.Adding to this, Steve Wilson, a cryptography expert and principal analyst at emerging technologies advisory firm Constellation Research told CoinDesk the final solution could also entail a “cultural” understanding specific to open-source development communities.“I bet you there are patterns and clues and inside jokes and a culture that might be useful for solving the problem,” he said, adding:“There are probably clues going on here and ways of solving problems that are shared by the community without necessarily being mathematical.”Below is a recounting of how the first three puzzles were figured out and how those techniques might be used to unlock the last of the bitcoin.310 BTC Bitcoin Challenge PNG image from bitcoinchallenge.codesIndeed, Pip himself affirms that part of the solution to the challenge can simply be gleaned through careful inspection of the image by anyone, even “while on the bus.”Hinting at techniques used in a branch of cryptography known as steganography, where secret messages are hidden in plain sight, the first step to cracking the code is merely paying attention to image details.Zooming in on the above image, some have found key pieces of information, such as a date reference to when the challenge first started.Transforming this image so that it is reflected by a central axis reveal additional clues to suggest the curves and lines superimposed on the mosaic-like grid actually serve to group together different letters and numbers scattered about.Another key element to uncovering the last remaining code is knowing what to look for in context of how bitcoin storage works.There’s a variety of different digital wallets able to hold bitcoins, or rather bitcoin private keys, indicating de facto ownership. Among the many ways a user might ensure safe holding of their tokens, a grouping of 12, 18 or 24 words – together called a “seed phrase” – can be randomly generated and used as the ultimate recovery password to gain wallet access.From a previous solution to a holding of 0.1 BTC, the seed phrase for one of the wallets in the challenge was: cry buyer grain save vault sign lyrics rhythm music fury horror mansion.And as most bitcoin enthusiasts will know, the possible words that make up these seed phrases are compiled in multi-language lists found on Github repositories of bitcoin improvement proposals.Therefore, in order to unlock the remaining bitcoin wallet, challenge participants will likely have to put together the correct combination of words to compose a bitcoin seed phrase relying upon one or more of these Github word lists.It’s unavoidable. There likely does require some knowledge of code manipulation in order to complete this challenge.For example, participants so far have relied on a programming operation known as bit shifting in order to decode messages found within the challenge image.As background, bit shifting essentially moves a value – be it a binary value composed of ones and zeroes or a hexadecimal value composed of numbers and letters – either to the left or to the right by a set amount, much like how you would add or subtract in basic mathematics.Looking closely at the original image, there is a grid of hexadecimal values that can be converted using a common shift key such as the challenge start date and then transformed into a new set of values.Edited 310 BTC Bitcoin Challenge PNG image. Original can be found on bitcoinchallenge.codesGiven this grid’s use case for other wallet solutions, it is likely that operations in the same vein as bit shifting will be required to further decode the message behind these values.Last but not least, this would not be a bitcoin challenge without emphasis on techniques used by computer science professionals and cryptographers.So far, challenge participants have leveraged an open-source software known as OpenSSL, or the Open Secure Sockets Layer, to decrypt part of the challenge solutions.Speaking to the highly popular use case for the technology, Constellation Research’s Wilson explained that in essence, OpenSSL is “a code library that helps you secure your website,” adding, “It’s being used by essentially every web server.”Indeed, the unique code base and commands of OpenSSL able to encrypt web communications has also been used to similarly encrypt digital wallet codes as part of Pip’s bitcoin challenge.Knowing all this, the remaining task of deciphering the last piece to the 310 BTC Bitcoin Challenge is most likely a mixture of these techniques.

However, it’s unclear at this juncture which of the two will become the dominant software of the BCH network – or if two distinct chains will continue to co-exist in the long-term.The last “common block” among bitcoin cash miners was #556,766, mined by SVPool. As of press time, Bitcoin.com – which is supporting Bitcoin ABC – had mined a new block, signifying that the two chains have divided into two, according to data from Coin.Dance.To recap, the implementation put out by leading bitcoin cash developer group Bitcoin ABC introduces a series of technical upgrades to the network, such as a reordering of transactions to increase block capacity as well as additional code to support greater interoperability between cryptocurrencies.The other implementation, dubbed Bitcoin “Satoshi’s Vision” or Bitcoin SV, rejects these changes to instead restore retired code from the original bitcoin protocol and increases the block size from 32 MB to 128 MB.In the lead-up to this event, threats of chain sabotage by avid Bitcoin SV supporter Craig Wright suggested the potential use of hash power to mine both a Bitcoin SV chain and create empty blocks on an opposing Bitcoin ABC chain, which could fatally damage operations on the opposing network.Though refuted by Bitcoin ABC supporters as unlikely, data three days prior to hard fork activation revealed that bitcoin cash mining pools supporting Bitcoin SV actually consolidated a majority of the network’s total hash power, suggesting strong capability to follow through on the threat.These numbers as they relate to hash power are still highly subject to change. Indeed, there remains the possibility of mining support switching from one side to another, as well as additional resources being added to reinforce either chain.With several platforms closely tracking the outcome of events still to come, the future of the bitcoin cash community remains to be determined.Road image via Shutterstock"

bitcoin custody startup Xapo, told CoinDesk: “If the [Bisq] founders want 
to ...","Oct 25, 2018 at 04:00 UTC","Of all the cryptocurrency projects describing themselves as “decentralized exchanges” (DEXs), Bisq may live up to the description better than most.","Operating since 2016, when it was originally called Bitsquare, the Bisq DEX runs directly on the user’s computer, rather than a hosted site, as many of the self-described DEXs currently do. And while DEXs like Airswap and Everbloom are operated by startups, Bisq is a strictly open source project developed by a grassroots collective.However, the team behind Bisq recognizes it has more to do to eliminate single points of failure. As Bisq contributor Felix Moreno, a former chief financial officer of the bitcoin custody startup Xapo, told CoinDesk:“If the [Bisq] founders want to go complete Satoshi and disappear from the project, it has to be able to survive that.”So the Bisq team is launching a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), essentially software designed to manage compensation for contributors to the project’s code without oversight from any single party. The testnet goes live in November, with the mainnet launching later this year.That compensation will come in the form of a new cryptocurrency called BSQ. It’s a colored coin, essentially bitcoin that’s been marked as representing some other form of value in a layer above the core protocol. The Bisq DAO will distribute bitcoin that’s been donated to the project, in this watermarked form, to those contributors that the community has voted to approve.“Every month there is this voting and compensation cycle where any contributor files a compensation request for the amount of BSQ,” Bisq co-founder Manfred Karrer told CoinDesk. “Then the BSQ stakeholders, anyone who has BSQ, can vote if they accept or decline this compensation request.”To be sure, this plan combines two crypto concepts with inauspicious histories. The bitcoin community’s colored coin projects have generally floundered and attracted far less usage than ethereum-based tokens, which allow people to issue their own cryptocurrency without creating a unique blockchain. And the most famous example of a DAO, known simply as The DAO, collapsed after a highly publicized security breach in 2016.Yet security is precisely the reason Bisq is launching BSQ on top of bitcoin, rather than ethereum, where The DAO debacle led to a contentious hard fork. Karrer said proof-of-work coins, which rely on miners doing complex calculations to update the blockchain ledger, are only secure when they’ve reached as widespread usage as bitcoin has. Furthermore, the Bisq community doesn’t believe that ethereum developers are able to provide secure, bug-free token generation quite yet.“It [BSQ] is running on bitcoin, which on one hand is much harder to do because the programming language is not as flexible. But on the other hand, it’s more secure,” Moreno said.So far, the Bisq project has received 2.5 bitcoin in donations, which can potentially be marked and divided into roughly 2.5 million BSQ tokens. But these tokens aren’t automatically generated. They are created if and when a DAO compensation proposal is approved. Then, much like a subway token or a movie ticket, BSQ will be consumed when someone spends them to use the DEX.Specifically, the tokens will be used to pay trading fees to Bisq and security deposits via the DEX’s multi-signature smart contract, which holds bitcoin in escrow until the seller confirms receiving payment (off-platform, in another currency) from the buyer.But while BSQ is one-time-use, the tokens will retain value as bitcoin, and those fees are generally used to pay bitcoin miners for processing transactions, as well as an arbitrator to referee disputes when necessary.The road ahead is steep. A comparative lack of market makers is a serious issue for the Bisq network.Many ethereum-based tokens that proliferate on other DEXs are scarcely represented on Bisq’s order book. For example, out of 236 sample Bisq orders for bitcoin, the only cryptocurrency payment option with more than 10 orders was the privacy coin monero, with just 23 compared to the 46 euro offers for bitcoin. Indeed, The Block reported nearly 89 percent of Bisq’s trading volume over the last three months involved monero.To a degree, this underscores the Bisq community’s privacy focus. When the DEX garnered more than $2 million in transactions through more than 979 trades in September, overall monero was the most popular crypto swapped directly for bitcoin. (Bisq also works through the anonymizing Tor browser.) Then the exchange reached an all-time high in October, with an overall monthly trading volume exceeding $3.5 million.Yet while Bisq has been regularly processing more than 900 transactions a month since April 2018, this is a small number of transactions compared to DEX ecosystems like 0x, which facilitates thousands of transactions a week, including more than 100 cryptocurrencies. In terms of overall offers, the institutionally focused Everbloom recently aggregated 140,000 offers at once and garnered roughly 5 percent of its traction from India, plus 7 percent from Turkish crypto traders.Moreno told CoinDesk the team aims to increase global diversity, especially fiat options. “We want it to be able to run in India and China, even if there’s a complete ban in those countries on all things crypto related,” he said.So far the only developing market Bisq has any modest volume in is Brazil, with just over $7,000 worth of transactions in September. Although most current users hail from tech-savvy circles in North America and Europe, volunteers are now working on a Farsi-language interface.A software developer who works in Iran’s nascent blockchain industry, Yashar Rashedi, told CoinDesk he is intrigued by Bisq’s potential. But Rashedi went on to say Bisq is not yet mature enough, both technically and in terms of a critical mass of users, to support crypto traders who need to circumnavigate internet censorship.Speaking more broadly about DEXs, he added:“Right now a very small percentage of people are using DEXs. They are complicated, slow, don’t have a matching engine (mostly), not completely decentralized and private as they promote themselves.”This is why bitcoin advocate Udi Wertheimer balks at the idea of calling Bisq a DEX at all. He told CoinDesk he sees Bisq as more of a peer-to-peer, over-the-counter trading desk.“Exchanges that don’t have [order books] can’t really help with price discovery, and are open to all kinds of manipulation,” Wertheimer said. “So they can’t really be considered exchanges in the same way that the incumbents are.”So far more than 144 people contributed to the Bisq project, with roughly 10 developers handling most of the heavy lifting. At the moment, roughly 200 people hold small amounts of BSQ.Many more will need to join the pack in order to create a truly decentralized BSQ ecosystem. Karrer concluded:“The goal is to become as decentralized and censorship-resistant as bitcoin. That’s a very high goal and it took bitcoin a very long time to get there.”Image of Manfred Karrer via the Bisq team"

At $2.8 billion, this year’s revenues had already surpassed last year’s total by the end of June, according to the document.if(""undefined""==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper[""QTeIQ""]={},window.datawrapper[""QTeIQ""].embedDeltas={""100"":520,""200"":439,""300"":400,""400"":400,""500"":400,""700"":400,""800"":400,""900"":400,""1000"":400},window.datawrapper[""QTeIQ""].iframe=document.getElementById(""datawrapper-chart-QTeIQ""),window.datawrapper[""QTeIQ""].iframe.style.height=window.datawrapper[""QTeIQ""].embedDeltas[Math.min(1e3,Math.max(100*Math.floor(window.datawrapper[""QTeIQ""].iframe.offsetWidth/100),100))]+""px"",window.addEventListener(""message"",function(a){if(""undefined""!=typeof a.data[""datawrapper-height""])for(var b in a.data[""datawrapper-height""])if(""QTeIQ""==b)window.datawrapper[""QTeIQ""].iframe.style.height=a.data[""datawrapper-height""][b]+""px""});Profits have also shot up in a few short years, from $48.6 million in 2015 to $952.6 million in 2017 – a 280 percent compound annual growth rate. While profits for the first half of 2018 have not quite surpassed the total for the whole of last year, they are close, at $952.2 million.For comparison, Nvidia, a chip manufacturer that enjoyed a windfall when crypto miners began to adopt its graphics processing unit (GPU) chips, but which long predates the invention of cryptocurrency, earned $3 billion on $9.7 billion in revenues in 2017.Intel, the semiconductor giant, earned $9.6 billion on $62.8 billion in revenues.The recently published prospectus also provides a detailed view of the sources of Bitmain’s revenues.The breakdown makes it clear that the bulk of Bitmain’s sales have consistently come from selling mining hardware, specifically the application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) that have displaced GPUs in a number of markets (in many cases, because Bitmain introduced the ASICs).Notably, however, mining hardware sales have grown as a share of total revenue, from 79 percent in 2015 to 94 percent in the first half of 2018.if(""undefined""==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper[""zTCA7""]={},window.datawrapper[""zTCA7""].embedDeltas={""100"":495,""200"":439,""300"":400,""400"":400,""500"":400,""700"":400,""800"":400,""900"":400,""1000"":400},window.datawrapper[""zTCA7""].iframe=document.getElementById(""datawrapper-chart-zTCA7""),window.datawrapper[""zTCA7""].iframe.style.height=window.datawrapper[""zTCA7""].embedDeltas[Math.min(1e3,Math.max(100*Math.floor(window.datawrapper[""zTCA7""].iframe.offsetWidth/100),100))]+""px"",window.addEventListener(""message"",function(a){if(""undefined""!=typeof a.data[""datawrapper-height""])for(var b in a.data[""datawrapper-height""])if(""zTCA7""==b)window.datawrapper[""zTCA7""].iframe.style.height=a.data[""datawrapper-height""][b]+""px""});The revenues contributed by other lines of business – most importantly, proprietary mining – have shrunk as a proportion of Bitmain’s total sales. In absolute terms, however, revenues from every source grew from 2015 to 2017 and appear set to grow again by the end of 2018.This breakdown could potentially raise questions about shrinking revenue diversification at Bitmain, as the company depends more and more on selling mining hardware. On the other hand, this monolithic category (“mining hardware”) hides Bitmain’s recent expansion into new sorts of mining hardware, which decreases its reliance on the market for bitcoin and bitcoin cash ASICs.“We have focused on developing mining hardware with different algorithms covering major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ether, Litecoin, Dash and Zcash,” the prospectus says, “which makes us one of the few companies offering mining solutions for various cryptocurrencies.”Crunching Bitmain’s revenue and profit numbers, something stands out: profit growth has lagged behind revenue growth by a noticeable margin, meaning that the company is either re-investing money in the business, or facing higher costs.It turns out, the answer is a bit of both. The largest increase in spending came from materials and manufacturing costs, which the company notes in its prospectus: “represent our payment to our production partners for the fabrication and the packaging and testing of our ASIC chips.”The steep rise in these costs – from just $93.7 million in 2017 to $1.5 billion in the first half of 2018 – signal that Bitmain is ramping up production fast.The increase in manufacturing and materials costs, the firm notes, “is in line with our business growth.”if(""undefined""==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper[""uqQE5""]={},window.datawrapper[""uqQE5""].embedDeltas={""100"":526,""200"":428,""300"":428,""400"":414,""500"":414,""700"":400,""800"":400,""900"":400,""1000"":400},window.datawrapper[""uqQE5""].iframe=document.getElementById(""datawrapper-chart-uqQE5""),window.datawrapper[""uqQE5""].iframe.style.height=window.datawrapper[""uqQE5""].embedDeltas[Math.min(1e3,Math.max(100*Math.floor(window.datawrapper[""uqQE5""].iframe.offsetWidth/100),100))]+""px"",window.addEventListener(""message"",function(a){if(""undefined""!=typeof a.data[""datawrapper-height""])for(var b in a.data[""datawrapper-height""])if(""uqQE5""==b)window.datawrapper[""uqQE5""].iframe.style.height=a.data[""datawrapper-height""][b]+""px""});The picture is not entirely rosy, however.The company took two big hits of around a quarter-billion dollars each in 2017 and 2018, which it describes as “provisions for impairment of inventories and prepayment to suppliers.”The document explains that these costs are ultimately due to the unpredictability of cryptocurrency prices: “the fluctuation of certain cryptocurrencies caused the anticipated selling price of certain mining hardware below their cost.”Bitmain is vulnerable to cryptocurrency market turns on more than one front.While it does mine on its own behalf and takes a share of mining pool rewards, those lines of business accounted for a fraction of revenues in the first half of 2018. Most of Bitmain’s (considerable) cryptocurrency holdings, the prospectus notes, come from sales of hardware settled in crypto.At the end of June, Bitmain held $886.9 million worth of bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ether, litecoin, dash and other crypto assets – more than twice what it held in fiat currency.﻿if(""undefined""==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper[""NpOcF""]={},window.datawrapper[""NpOcF""].embedDeltas={""100"":484,""200"":414,""300"":414,""400"":400,""500"":400,""700"":400,""800"":400,""900"":400,""1000"":400},window.datawrapper[""NpOcF""].iframe=document.getElementById(""datawrapper-chart-NpOcF""),window.datawrapper[""NpOcF""].iframe.style.height=window.datawrapper[""NpOcF""].embedDeltas[Math.min(1e3,Math.max(100*Math.floor(window.datawrapper[""NpOcF""].iframe.offsetWidth/100),100))]+""px"",window.addEventListener(""message"",function(a){if(""undefined""!=typeof a.data[""datawrapper-height""])for(var b in a.data[""datawrapper-height""])if(""NpOcF""==b)window.datawrapper[""NpOcF""].iframe.style.height=a.data[""datawrapper-height""][b]+""px""});At 28 percent of total assets, Bitmain’s crypto holdings made up a slightly smaller share in June than at the end of 2017 (30 percent).

He will guide the Mexico City-based startup’s expansion in Latin America, including a new system for price-stable assets that Hanke will design himself.“He’s very close to the problems that we are trying to solve,” AirTM CEO Ruben Galindo told CoinDesk, suggesting inflation in Argentina and Mexico might make those markets ripe for user acquisition and marketing campaigns.Indeed, throughout his career, Hanke has advised several governments, including Argentina (which, it should be noted, did not fully heed his advice), on ways to stabilize their currencies with a combination of exchange controls and fiat-pegged reserves.“Imagine you’re playing with golf and get to play with Tiger Woods. That’s how we feel with Hanke,” Galindo said.This seemingly unlikely alliance comes at a time when so-called stablecoins are all the rage, with several new assets of this kind launching this year to compete with the long-running and dominant but beleaguered tether (USDT). While the main use case for stablecoins so far is allowing crypto traders to move money between exchanges quickly without relying on the banking system, AirTM is among those that see broader applications.Despite his skepticism about other crypto coins, Hanke told CoinDesk he sees potential in price-stable digital assets, saying:“It is a good idea conceptually, but no one knows how to do it… I know how to do it. I’ve done it.”AirTM now has two separate stablecoin projects. Previously, the company started issuing an ethereum-based token collateralized by fiat.“AirTM dollars will be an ERC20 token that will be backed by dollars in our reserve, with the help of our banking partner Synapsify,” Galindo said. “I see a great value for stablecoins in developing nations.”There is already $3 million worth of AirTM dollars in circulation out of the total supply worth $10 million.Perhaps more ambitiously, Hanke will design a currency-board style system for issuing price-stable digital currencies through AirTM. According to Hanke, a currency board – a type of monetary authority that prioritizes fixed exchange rates over the other objectives of central banks – guarantees the asset’s price remains perfectly stable against the anchor.It’s unclear what Hanke’s upcoming AirTM assets will eventually look like, or how they will fit into the AirTM ecosystem, although the economist expects his design will also involve blockchain technology.“It would be a unit of account that is stable and could be used for clearing,” he said, adding this new asset would not be as speculative as cryptocurrencies like bitcoin.In Hanke’s mind, the fact that bitcoin was designed so that the overall supply capped at 21 million digital coins inherently guarantees its price will be speculative. He prefers to focus on dollarization, the process of aligning monetary policies with anchors such as the U.S. greenback.“You have a completely inelastic supply curve,” he said of bitcoin, meaning the amount to be issued is set in stone regardless of what the price does. “Who in their right mind would make a contract with bitcoin?”Hanke told CoinDesk he was drawn to AirTM because the company, which he described as a digital clearing house helping Venezuelans swap bolivars for U.S. dollars, has some of the world’s best primary data about Venezuelan currency trading. As of May 2018, the company’s records showed 65 percent of AirTM’s 4,000 daily users hailed from inflation-riddled Venezuela.The startup itself needed guidance on macroeconomics as it expands across Latin America, plus insights into how to offer a greater variety of stable assets across borders. Hanke wanted a way to apply his research and experience to the current crisis in Venezuela. It was a perfect match.This economist believes his upcoming blockchain solutions will offer a more stable unit of account that meets bitcoin’s original objective outlined in the decade-old white paper, which stated the cryptocurrency would be a “purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash” allowing “online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.”Galindo, a veteran bitcoin user, said he’s excited to offer a variety of cryptocurrency tools to users in inflation-riddled countries. He described AirTM as a “dollarization machine” for Latin America.“If people have a use for bitcoin for some reason, we’ll give them access to it,” Galindo said. “In the future, it will be so much easier to issue new currencies on a digital currency-board type of thing than with paper.”The entrepreneur went on to say he doesn’t judge assets based on how people use them, whether for speculation, trade or clearing. Unlike the academic Hanke, Galindo avoids labeling which assets are “currencies.”Instead, the AirTM team aims to provide Latin Americans with lawful on-ramps for useful assets, regardless of form. Overall, Latin American crypto users conduct $9 million worth of transactions a month through AirTM’s businesses.“We don’t care who owns the asset. If it’s the Venezuelan government who wants to have a USD reserve and they want to audit it, we wouldn’t mind giving people access to that,” Galindo said, concluding:“If in the future, a president calls Professor Hanke up and says we want to solve hyperinflation, he will know that AirTM has the infrastructure to do that.”Steve Hanke image via YouTube"

Further, it witnessed a symmetrical triangle breakout earlier this week, suggesting that bulls had come out victorious in a tug of war with the bears.The breakout had looked legitimate as the technical indicators turned increasingly bullish. In particular, the relative strength index rose to a three-month high of 59.00 yesterday, signaling strong bullish conditions.As a result, BTC was expected to remain well bid above $6,500 and looked likely to rise to $6,800 in the near-term.Instead, it fell back to $6,450 on Coinbase earlier today, invalidating the bullish higher lows and higher highs pattern, as seen in the chart below.The rising channel seen in the hourly chart has been breached to the downside, meaning the recovery rally from the Oct. 31 low of $6,201 likely ended at a high of $6,540 reached yesterday.The stacking order of the 50-hour exponential moving average (EMA) above the 100-hour EMA, above the 200-hour EMA indicates the path of least resistance is still on the higher side. That bullish signal could soon weaken, though, as moving averages are lagging indicators.While the channel breakdown has opened the doors for a deeper drop to $6,372 (horizontal support line), a bearish reversal would be confirmed only if BTC drops below 6,200 (Oct. 31 low).Over on the daily chart, BTC bears may feel emboldened if prices drop below $6,200, negating the higher low pattern. That scenario seems unlikely with bitcoin’s current lack of volatility, however.Investors should keep an eye out for a strong bounce from the ascending (bullish) 10-day EMA, as that could recharge the engines for a rally to $6,800.Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.Bitcoin image via CoinDesk archives; Charts by Trading View "

The design requirements for traditional chips are very different from those needed for crypto, he said, and in fact that provides the industry a special advantage.Even if history is repeating itself in terms of price cycles, the market dynamics of cryptocurrency mining are certainly shifting, with major industry players now more mature and even eyeing initial public offerings (IPOs).As CoinDesk has reported, another mining firm, Canaan Creative, has already filed an application to go public in Hong Kong, as has Bitmain – although its bid to go public hasn’t been without controversy.Further, Bitmain, which has a dominant position as a maker of cryptocurrency mining hardware, is facing increasing disruption from competitors, as well.Discussing these factors, Xin Xu, CEO and co-founder of ethereum mining pool SparkPool, said a sign that the cryptocurrency market has become relatively more mature is that the mining industry is “starting to get into the public’s eye sight.”Monzon shared a similar view, saying that, with mining playing a key role in supporting cryptocurrency networks, increasing public awareness “points to some maturity.”Still, the industry players on the panel were somewhat skeptical when discussing the IPO aims of some mining companies.Speaking from an investor’s perspective, Bing Lin, CEO and co-founder of C Block Capital Group, said that, after having reviewed the financial numbers of many mining firms, he believed that many of them spent their revenue on seemingly irrelevant research and development, such as on AI and the internet of things.Lin said:“That’s like investing in the sesame, not the steak. I don’t feel that being listed necessarily gives you an advantage. Money is not necessarily the only driver.”Adding to that point, Innosilicon’s Ao commented: “If you truly believe in blockchain, you would continue to be creative without the constrains after going for public money,” referring to public firms’ strictly mandated earnings disclosures and financial stability.Monzon further expressed doubts that there will be an IPO from a crypto mining firm in 2018, adding: “I don’t think Bitmain’s business model is even sustainable.”Panel image via CoinDesk"

Did Satoshi Nakomoto at the time fully grasp the historical significance and unique opportunity presented in autumn 2008 to kickstart a new financial system and motivate people to use a new currency?It is timely to reflect back on both these events, and how the two have evolved in the years since arguably the greatest global financial shock since the Great Depression.The 2008 financial crisis reached its nadir with the collapse of Lehman Brothers on September 15, just six weeks before Satoshi Nakamoto published the bitcoin paper.With the passage of time and post-crisis economic recovery, some may have forgotten just how serious the financial crisis was. In fact, Lehman’s bankruptcy led to such a panic that famed Wall Street wizards like Pimco’s Mohammed El-Erian asked his wife to withdraw cash over the fear that ATMs could stop working.In the wake of the Lehman cataclysm, a number of initiatives arose that were aimed at preventing another financial crisis. New regulations and capital requirements like the Dodd-Frank Act in the U.S. and the Basel III banking standards were introduced. A second response to the crisis was socio-political, marked by the rise of movements like Occupy Wall Street.What has been the lasting impact of these regulatory and social initiatives?From our vantage point today in 2018 we can see that financial institutions like Lehman are not the only things that have been reduced to ashes. Many of the regulatory restrictions on financial institutions introduced post-crisis have been or are in the process of being eroded away, and social movements like Occupy Wall Street have long since fizzled out and faded into memory.Given the lack of lasting structural and political reform, should we expect another financial crisis? The short answer to this question is an unequivocal yes.The economist Hyman Minsky developed a theoretical framework showing that reoccurring financial crises are an inherent feature of our current financial system. In other words, it is always only a matter of time before the next blowup.Unfortunately for Minsky (and all of us), his theory was largely dismissed by the mainstream economics community and central bankers during his lifetime, leaving Minsky somewhat of a tragic Van Gough-like figure in the economics world. However, post-2008 his theory has at last seen the more favorable treatment it deserved by economists, and very few today would argue that some type of permanent ‘great moderation’ of financial instability is at all realistic.Former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen recently sounded the economic alarm, highlighting in particular the relaxation of loan standards, saying “there has been a huge deterioration in standards; covenants have been loosened in leveraged lending” and “I am worried about the systemic risks associated with these loans.” There are numerous other unsettling developments roiling global markets today that may increase the likelihood of soon seeing another “Minsky moment,” although relatively subdued inflation provides central banks with some room to maneuver.In markets, it is the timing, not the diagnosis, that is nearly always the hardest part to get right.Right on the heels of Lehman’s bankruptcy, a hitherto unknown figure named Satoshi Nakamoto published a paper on an obscure technology mailing list describing a new “peer-to-peer electronic cash system” that utilized a ledger secured with “hash-based proof-of-work” (or what we now refer to as a ‘blockchain’).The bitcoin paper was initially greeted with skepticism by the handful of people who actually read it, and even after Bitcoin was operationalized on January 3, 2009, it was largely ignored for the first year of its existence. Bitcoin hardly got off to an auspicious start.However, Bitcoin steadily attracted more use and interest, and a growing group of people began to see that the innovation created by Satoshi’s solution to the long bedeviling ‘double-spending problem’ in computer science could also serve as a cornerstone for creating a new and better financial system.As I suggested in 2014, regulatory reform would fail to fundamentally address the root causes of the financial crisis and other problems embedded in traditional finance. Regulations enacted in the wake of a crisis are too often easily rolled-back once the waters have calmed, and it can be difficult to sustain over time the momentum of social movements focused around obtuse subjects like financial system reform.Instead, I argued that to truly fix the problems in our financial system we needed to change our problematic financial architecture, or ‘plumbing,’ as it is referred to by economists like Olivier Blanchard.A new blockchain-powered financial infrastructure offers the possibility of long-lasting improvements and changes in the fundamental nature of our financial system. One particularly radical sea changes that Satoshi’s invention makes possible is that in a blockchain-based system we ‘the people’ can effectively become the bank.Many of the details associated with bitcoin’s creation, such as the explanation for why Satoshi chose Halloween as the actual paper publication date, remain unanswered.What we do know is that such unanswered questions have generated immense curiosity, creating a durable mystique around Satoshi Nakamoto and attracting an unprecedented level of attention to his alternative currency. And the resultant publicity has arguably proven just as important to bitcoin’s success as the underlying technical innovation.In addition to computer science, mathematics, cryptography, and economics, we must also be sure to append the often-underemphasized skill of marketing to Satoshi Nakamoto’s diversified CV.What we also now know 10 years on, with the millions of rapidly growing users of cryptocurrency, is that for those interested in reforming the financial system Satoshi’s invention of bitcoin and blockchain technology has proven to be the ultimate “treat.”And what about for the many banks and others invested in maintaining the financial system status quo? Was there some message Satoshi was trying to send to this group by publishing on Halloween 10 years ago?Based on a number of other clues and comments left by Bitcoin’s creator, I think we can pretty safely guess what Satoshi had in mind.Jack-O-Latern via Shutterstock"

Again, prices tanked – although it seems to have taken several hours, until the start of the US. trading day, for this measure to have its full effect…”Included in the report (and posted below) is a graph detailing market developments in the wake of both the SEC and FSA announcements. The BIS report goes on to outline other effects that regulation-related news has had on the market, but the data itself begs the question: why is this the case?Auer and Claessens posit that, in part, this is because of the reliance on regulated exchange points when moving funds from cryptocurrencies to government-issued ones.“Part of our interpretation is that cryptocurrencies rely on regulated institutions to convert regular currency into cryptocurrencies. Their cumbersome setup also means that many consumers hold and transact in cryptocurrencies through more interfaces, such as online crypto-wallets that are often regulated, or can be regulated in principle,” the two wrote, going on to state:“And international arbitrage is still limited. Agents cannot easily access cryptocurrencies’ markets offshore – because they may need to have a bank account in the foreign jurisdiction. Factors such as these create market segmentation and fragmentation, which currently make national regulatory actions bind to some degree.”Simply put, the report contends that such an impact suggests that regulations themselves can have an effect on the cryptocurrency space.“Our analysis shows that despite the entity-free and borderless nature of cryptocurrencies, regulatory actions as well as news regarding potential regulatory actions can have a strong impact on cryptocurrency markets, at least in terms of valuations and transaction volumes,” the authors later conclude.Image via Shutterstock"

The company already has 40 BTMs in the state, having been operating under a provisional license pending full approval.In a statement, NYDFS superintendent Maria Vullo confirmed the news, saying the license approval is “a further step in implementing strong regulatory safeguards and effective risk-based controls while encouraging the responsible growth of financial innovation.”Receiving the BitLicense, Spencer told CoinDesk, “is a validation of our business model [and] our compliance model.”He explained:“It’s been a long, involved process. The initial application was [in 2015, and] since then what we’ve seen is a great deal of diligence on NYDFS’ part, really pushing us to both explain and in some cases improve our policies and procedures.”These ranged from having a business disaster continuity plan to state-of-the-art cybersecurity measures, Spencer indicated. During the evaluation period, Coinsource grew from being an unaudited firm with three employees and a handful of BTMs to being fully audited and growing to more than 20 employees and over 200 machines.“We’ve had 500 percent growth over three consecutive years in terms of machines, and we’ve had comparable growth in revenue until spring of 2018, when it slowed down substantially,” he said.Compared with traditional exchanges, the firm’s BTMs are convenient and offer direct peer-to-peer transactions, Spencer said, adding: “We do our account opening and compliance in real-time.”The machines’ speed comes from a proprietary system that Coinsource developed to conduct know-your-customer checks. Where a customer would have to send a crypto exchange bank details and other proof of identification, Coinsource only needs a driver’s license, a selfie and a cellphone number.Coinsource also makes it easier for unbanked individuals to access cryptocurrencies, Spencer said, as they do not need to possess a bank account to purchase bitcoin and can pay with cash.At present, Coinsource customers can only buy or sell bitcoin through the BTMs – they can’t actually send funds to other wallets yet.Spencer explained that this is by design, as allowing that would be facilitating money transmission, so “you have to have a money transmission license in both jurisdictions – where you’re starting the transaction and where you’re ending the transaction.However, the company currently has money transmission licenses in 18 states, with pending licenses in another 15. Spencer anticipates that by sometime next year, Coinsource will have be licensed in all 50 states.“At that point in time, we’d be in a position to have people deposit cash into machines and transfer bitcoin into a third-party wallet, provided both customers were registered,” he said.Outside of the U.S., Coinsource plans to expand operations potentially to Japan, South Africa and Puerto Rico.Of these, Puerto Rico is likely to happen first, with the company already having a money transmitting license for the territory.“We have had preliminary discussions with regulators in Japan to use that as a springboard for Asia, and we’ve had initial conversations with bankers and regulators in South Africa, but that’s probably the furthest out in terms of development,” Spencer said.Further, being incorporated in Argentina, Coinsource already has a base for Latin and South American expansion.The addition of cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin across all the firm’s machines is also on the cards in the “near future,” but “that’s contingent, of course, on regulatory approval,” he said.Bitcoin ATM image courtesy of Coinsource"

for ...","Oct 9, 2018 at 04:00 UTC",Kaizen.,"The Japanese word for “improvement,” and as it relates to business, it’s the philosophy of continuous improvement on working practices. And with that as the tagline for the fifth edition of bitcoin engineering conference Scaling Bitcoin, it became a perfect way to summarize what’s happening today among the cryptocurrency’s developer ecosystem.With the scaling debate coming to a head last year – and ending with a group of big block supporting enthusiasts breaking off to form competing cryptocurrency bitcoin cash and bitcoin getting the long-awaited code upgrade Segregated Witness (SegWit) – this year’s Scaling Bitcoin conference just didn’t have the flair that perhaps past events had.What seemed pulled from another piece of the kaizen philosophy – the notion of eliminating waste for a lean business – many of the talks over the two-day conference held at Keio University in Tokyo revolved around little updates that could make a big difference in terms of efficiency of the network.From figuring out what to do with the vast amount of so-called dust (an output with tiny pieces of a bitcoin in them, small enough that the fees for sending eclipse the amount sent) on the network to fine-tuning the lightning network, Scaling Bitcoin seemed to present a much more relaxed and focused developer community.Jameson Lopp, a bitcoin developer and engineer at bitcoin security startup Casa, agreed.“Most of the presentations were of small improvements that seem fairly likely to be implemented, which is arguably preferable to huge overhauls that promise significant improvements but add a lot of complexity and would be contentious,” he told CoinDesk, adding:“Lots of small improvements add up over time too large improvements.”Still, that doesn’t mean the several hundred developers, academics and Japanese technology enthusiasts in attendance weren’t reminded about the potential of the protocol.During Keio University professor Jun Murai’s opening keynote, he pointed out that in 2000, only 6 percent of the world population was using the internet, but by 2017, more than 54 percent of the global population was online.“When you are developing for the bitcoin scale, this is what you have to see and to think,” Murai said.One area of small improvements that several presentations touched on was the massive amount of UTXOs, or unspent transaction outputs – especially those holding bitcoin dust.For Sergi Delgado Segura, a cryptocurrency researcher at the Autonomous University of Barcelona, the question is “how many unspent outputs are actually worth spending; how much space is devoted to storing not-worth-spending outputs?”Looking at the question with 110 satoshi’s per byte in mind, according to Segura, about 50 percent of UTXOs are actually dust – meaning those pieces of bitcoin are unlikely to ever be spent.“This is nothing new; this has been going on since the beginning of the coin,” he said, although, added: “We are reaching a certain point where this is becoming a real problem.”For instance, the same research was applied to litecoin and Segura found that almost 80 percent of UTXOs are dust.This becomes a problem namely for user’s ability to run a full node, especially in low resource devices (like general purpose laptops). By storing all these “unprofitable” UTXOs on the blockchain, full nodes must download and store all this data, even though it’s nearly useless.As bitcoin attracts more users, Segura said, the amount of dust-based UTXOs will grow, and it will grow unbounded because that’s how the system was built. While Segura said that’s not because anyone did anything wrong, there does need to be some real thought put into the proposals out there to mitigate this.For one, Segura said, everyone should be consolidating outputs when fees are low – like they are right now. Secondly, a good coin selection algorithm, which decides which bits of date come together to create a user’s bitcoin transaction, will also help.There are other proposals for this problem as well.For instance, Benedikt Bunz proposed using RSA accumulators, a cryptographic one-way function that answers a query about something without revealing all the individual data points that were used to come to that answer.While Merkle trees have been utilized in the past to allow clients to check that an unspent UTXO is being used without sending the client the entire state of the blockchain, RSA accumulators could be a more efficient replacement.During a Bitcoin Core (the most popular bitcoin software) developer meeting on Monday, October 8, Tadge Dryja, a developer and the co-author of the lightning network paper, proposed a similar thing.Instead of RSA accumulators – which he said are “unproven” – he’s working on a hash-based accumulator whereby the hash of each UTXO is stored, decreasing the amount of storage by half. Plus, instead of storing all the hashes of every UTXO, Dryja wondered whether storing some “compact representation,” or aggregated bundle of the UTXOs with their proofs would be less cumbersome.According to Lopp, cleaning up the UTXO architecture has been discussed on and off for about six years, and hopefully, with the concept of accumulators, something can be implemented that’s efficient.As the lightning network gains momentum, it’s no surprise that the layer-two scaling technology for pushing transactions off-chain got a significant amount of time.On day two of the conference, lightning had its own category – representing three talks that covered rebalancing (or the idea of closing a channel after a number of transactions have been performed) of lightning network channels; lightning benchmarks; and incentivizing watchtowers, the entities responsible for watching lightning channels to make sure no fraud occurs.But on top of that, other layer-two solutions got attention as well.For instance, in the incredibly fast-talking style Olaoluwa “Laolu” Osuntokun has become known for, the respected developer and co-founder of Lightning Labs, spoke about payment channels more broadly.And not only just a one-to-one payment channel but multi-party payment channels and channels upon channels.One such topic was so-called “channel factories,” which Laolu defined as “a layered set of transactions of intermediate transactions” – so multi-party channels layered on each other, each with their own way of validating transactions.He also spoke about route tunneling, or the ability to connect to users on other layers of the multi-party channel in order to create a specific channel with them.Speaking about this idea, Laolu said:“It’s sort of like a new dimension or a new underworld and you can tunnel them into the third dimension which I think is pretty cool.”This, he said, could be used if, for instance, “the liquidity wasn’t sufficient for selling stickers or whatever is cool these days, I can advertise shortcut routes that tunnel through channel formation. We are able to create new channels in seconds to satisfy directional flow above ground.”Other layer-two solutions that were touched on at the conference include statechains and a bitcoin bridge called Niji.Speaking to another difference between this year’s Scaling Bitcoin and subsequent year’s, Lopp said, it was the focus on lightning and the idea that “in general it is going to be easier to make changes to second layers because changes don’t require the same level of consensus if at all.”Scaling Bitcoin badge on computer image via CoinDesk"

The former chairperson of the U.S. central bank has struck critical tones in the past toward cryptocurrency, but elsewhere had said she views blockchain as an “important technology.”A day later, according to an email obtained by CoinDesk, Raz Suprovici, the founder of bitcoin gifting service Biterica, sent Yellen 0.0031642 BTC – or roughly $20 – by way of her University of California Berkeley e-mail address.When contacted to confirm the gift, Yellen said that she had received it but hasn’t gone far in investigating her newly-obtained coins.“I did receive a gift of bitcoins this morning and have been very busy ever since so I’ve not looked into it further,” she wrote. Yellen further said that she did not have anything to add to her previous remarks about bitcoin this week.Suprovici told CoinDesk that he wanted to help Yellen learn more about bitcoin, seeing the gift as the best avenue for that to occur.“Based on the way she spoke about it at the conference, it seemed that she had never owned any bitcoin,” he said, adding:“People are afraid of the unknown. I was hoping that when she logged into her bitcoin wallet with her ID and password, she would see it’s just like a typical online bank account. The money she owns is there, in her control, ready to spend … I hope that this sparks her openness to the technology.”“Maybe all policy-makers should be gifted a little bit of bitcoin,” he added.Janet Yellen image via Federalreserve / Wikimedia Commons"

Gox has revealed new details about the pace of cryptocurrency sales as part of the firm’s bankruptcy and rehabilitation process.,"Attorney Nobuaki Kobayashi explained in a September 25 notice on the Mt. Gox website that over $230 million dollar’s worth of bitcoin (BTC) and bitcoin cash (BCH) had been exchanged for fiat currency between March 18 and the start of civil rehabilitation on June 22.According to the notice, the trustee sold 24,658.00762 BTC and 25,331.00761 BCH – quantities that brought in 25,975,702,352 Japanese yen, or $230,269,821.82.Following the sale, the balance in the trustee account was “approximately JPY 70,059 million,” or around $621 million, Kobayashi added.In the notice, the trustee also explained that a trust has been set up to preserve funds in fiat for bankruptcy creditors of the exchange.Explaining the move to sell off the cryptos before the civil rehabilitation was initiated, Kobayashi wrote it was “necessary and appropriate to procure a suitable amount of money to secure the interests [of] the creditors for the principal amount and delay damages of the determined and undetermined bankruptcy claims” before the trust was set up.While some creditors had applied for fiat refunds from the remaining holdings of Mt. Gox, others had requested to have their balances in cryptocurrency returned, since the values of BTC and BCH have climbed far above the levels seen at the time of the exchange’s closure in 2014.While likely good news for creditors seeking to be repaid in fiat, the sell-offs haven’t been welcomed by some quarters of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Indeed, some have argued that the Gox trustee sales are partially behind the bear market seen across cryptocurrencies since the start of the year.Back in March, CoinDesk reported that $400 million in BTC and BCH had been sold off in the preceding months by the Gox trustee, with Kobayashi stressing that the process was being carried out in a way that would not negatively impact the market.Japanese yen image via Shutterstock"

In this newly-created position, Lopp will focus on making sure the company’s products complement its annual $10,000 premium vault service with a waiting list that already includes hundreds of bitcoin users.For example, the startup has sold more than 500 Casa Lightning Nodes, a device introduced in early September which taps into a second-layer scaling solution for bitcoin transactions called the Lightning Network.“We’ve only shipped our first batch, but it’s actually conceivable that if our current sales continue at the pace that they have been, by the end of the year Casa nodes could make up 20-25 percent all the Lightning nodes on the network,” Lopp told CoinDesk.Already, Casa nodes constitute roughly 12 percent of the 4,000-or-so nodes operating on the Lightning Network. The device allows users to just plug in, sync up the full bitcoin node that’s included inside, and start operating a Lightning channel within minutes if the user has some bitcoin. Without such products, operating a Lightning node requires an unusually high level of computer literacy, the type that restricts its use to programmers and tech-savvy hobbyists.For Lopp, the node is more than just a way to facilitate small everyday transactions in bitcoin through lightning. Rather, it’s a way to help make good on the cryptocurrency’s liberating promise.He said:“This is the ultimate level of self-sovereignty where you are yourself validating everything yourself on the device sitting there in your house.”Indeed, a fervent desire to make self-sovereign technical solutions more accessible was precisely what inspired Lopp to leave the institution-centric custody startup BitGo, where he was a backend engineer, to join Casa in March.Lopp is perhaps best known in the community for going “off-the-grid” earlier this year to live with his guns, Tolkienesque beard, an arsenal of wilderness-friendly gadgets. He applies the same homesteader mentality to managing financial assets as well.“It’s perfectly fine if people choose to trust a third party. But the whole reason we got into this system in the first place is that people don’t have to do that if they don’t want to,” Lopp said. “Having a non-custodial wallet where each user is their own bank is the first step of that.”In Casa’s vault service, which launched this past summer, includes a mobile app that works with the client’s own Trezor or Ledger hardware wallets, creating a multisignature storage system where Casa holds just one out of five keys as an emergency backup. The mobile app hosts yet another set of keys and the client can keep others elsewhere.Completing a transaction will require three out of the five keys, so if, say, the hardware wallet is stolen, the user’s money is still safe. Subscribers also have various alerts and notifications to help keep their devices and systems up-to-date.As a service-oriented startup, Casa will focus on tricks and tools to help such subscribers manage long-term bitcoin storage, including inheritance planning and protecting their hardware wallets. In addition to upkeep on the bitcoin-centric node product and key management service, Lopp will help develop complementary products and investigate how to keep all these devices safely up-to-date when Casa adds support for other blockchain-based assets beyond bitcoin.“I do see complexities and trade-offs coming in to play as we become an organization that supports a wider variety of systems,” he said. “So it will be fun to tackle that.”Speaking to his broader vision for Casa hardware products, Lopp concluded:“I’m just trying to merge together best practices that are hard to understand or create a huge learning curve, and package them in a way that’s simplified….you want to get a kit that includes everything you need and follow some simple instructions.”Image via Jameson Lopp"

As a result, the sell-off has stalled in the last 36 hours, although corrective rallies have been shallow.Notably, the cryptocurrency’s failure to scale $6,400 in a convincing manner despite signs of bullish reversal on intraday charts indicates that bearish sentiment is still quite strong.Hence, the next big move is more likely to be on the downside. At press time, BTC is changing hands at $6,290, representing a 0.6 percent rise in a 24-hour basis.The rising wedge breakdown and the downward sloping 5-day and 10-day moving averages (MAs), as seen in the chart above, indicate the path of least resistance is to the downside. The RSI of 39.14 is also biased toward the bears.As can be seen, BTC suffered a pennant breakdown on the daily line chart on Saturday, signaling a revival of the long-term bear market. Hence, prices could re-test the June lows below $5,800 in the next few days.The bullish divergence of the RSI has set the stage for a stronger corrective rally, however, it is likely to happen only above the trendline hurdle, currently located at $6,420.Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.Bitcoin image via Shutterstock; Charts by Trading View"

Further, trading on other, non-U.S. exchanges will not be interrupted during the suspension, the release suggested.“The broker-dealer application materials submitted to enable the offer and sale of these financial products in the U.S., as well as certain trading websites, characterize them as ‘Exchange Traded Funds.’ Other public sources characterize the instruments as ‘Exchange Traded Notes.’ By contrast, the issuer characterizes them in its offering materials as ‘non-equity linked certificates,'” the release reads.The SEC went on to say that the decision was in “the public interest” and that it was line with its mandate to ensure the “protection of investors.”The news comes nearly a month after the products, live on the Nasdaq Stockholm exchange since 2015, made a move to court U.S. investors, announcing that they would be quoted in U.S. dollars starting August 15.Billed as a “soft opening” for public markets crypto trading in press coverage by Bloomberg, the products were contrasted with more sophisticated exchange-traded fund (ETF) products which had recently been shot down by regulators and described as a more immediate way to access crypto exposure with dollars.“Everyone that’s investing in dollars can now get exposure to these products, whereas before, they were only available in euros or Swedish krona,” Ryan Radloff, the chief executive officer at CoinShares Holdings said at the time.Representatives from CoinShares Holdings declined to provide comment when reached.SEC image via Shutterstock"

At press time, they would be worth approximately $32 million.In Monday’s filing, he claims that 5,000 bitcoin in a wallet affiliated with him belonged to another individual whom he assisted, and that he, at no point, had access to the bitcoin.In a separate affidavit, Shrem says he helped this individual (whose name was redacted, with a note stating that an unredacted version remains under seal) transfer 5,000 bitcoin into a cold storage wallet in 2012.Shrem goes on to state that he “never moved those bitcoin again.”He added that he did not have access to the coins afterward, either. As such, he claims he “never personally owned the 5,000 bitcoins discussed above, nor have I ever personally owned 5,000 bitcoins all at one time.”Addressing the part of the Winklevoss brothers’ complaint stating he spent bitcoin to purchase new cars, boats and a $2 million property, Shrem added:“After I was released from prison, I had a net worth of less than $100,000 and worked for approximately six months at a restaurant in Pennsylvania. Since working at the restaurant, I have worked a variety of jobs that have allowed me to accumulate funds and to restore myself financially.”To support his claim, Shrem attached a pair of printouts of transactions as logged by Blockchain, showing that 5,000 bitcoin were moved twice on Dec. 31, 2012, into and later, out of a wallet associated with Shrem. Another redacted document includes emails explaining these transactions.He also claims that despite suggestions to the contrary, he has paid part of the $950,000 he owes federal authorities as part of his 2014 guilty plea deal for running an unlicensed money-transmitting business.Opposing the prejudgement freezing of some of his assets, Shrem further claimed that Winklevoss Capital Fund, the entity named in the plaintiffs’ side of the lawsuit, fails to prove either that the overall suit would succeed or that Shrem actively sought to defraud the plaintiffs.Tyler Winklevoss, Cameron Winklevoss and the Winklevoss Capital Fund did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

bitcoin's most severe bugs was discovered and patched last week.","Sep 25, 2018 at 04:40 UTC",“Shock” is perhaps the word that best describes the mood ever since one of bitcoin’s most severe bugs was discovered and patched last week.,"As the community reels over the vulnerability that was hiding in the code for two years, and that could have been exploited to print more bitcoins than the 21 million is hard-coded to be produced, developers are wondering: Is there a way to prevent such a severe bug from being added to the code again?Days after the discover, there hasn’t been any formal proposals. But that’s not to say the event hasn’t prompted discussion about how bitcoin works and how similar bugs in the cryptocurrency’s most popular software implementation, Bitcoin Core, can be identified and resolved in the future.It’s an important question, too – What if a malicious actor had found the exploit first? What if there are other hidden bugs in the code right now?To this point, pseudonymous bitcoin subreddit moderator ‘Theymos’ urged the community not to forget the bug.He argued it was “was undeniably a major failure” in a widely-circulated post, adding:“If all of Bitcoin Core’s policies and practices are kept the same, then it’s inevitable that a similar failure will eventually happen again, and we might not be so lucky with how it turns out that time.”That said, there’s an argument to be made that Bitcoin Core, powered by an open network of global participants, now has a more robust process for code review than at any time in the technology’s history.Right now, the implementation has more developers than ever contributing to the open-source codebase. And it is tested quite a bit; by one estimate, tests make up nearly 20 percent of the codebase.Still, developers argue more could be done to make sure the digital money works smoothly.Theymos thinks one avenue would be to build “more sophisticated” tests tailored at locating severe, but hard to find bugs, like the one last week. “Perhaps all large bitcoin companies should be expected by the community to assign skilled testing specialists to Core,” he continued, adding:“Currently a lot of companies don’t contribute anything to Core development.”Bitcoin Core contributor James Hilliard stressed much the same, suggesting that developers can increase the “amount” and “quality” of testing. Though, this might be easier said than done. Bitcoin Core contributor Greg Maxwell agreed in Theymos’s thread that testing is important, but the quality and detail of the tests is important.“Directing more effort into testing has been a long-term challenge for us, in part because the art and science of testing is no less difficult than any other aspect of the system’s engineering. Testing involves particular skills and aptitudes that not everyone has,” Maxwell said.This sort of expertise is hard to find.“Bitcoin development is largely bottlenecked by code review and there are not a large amount of people out there who are able to do that,” Hilliard told CoinDesk.Yet, many others believe the responsibility shouldn’t only rest on developers. A common sentiment shared was that as a decentralized project with no leaders, keeping bitcoin free of errors is a shared responsibility.“My main problem with a lot of the backlash is people pointing at specific developers to assign blame. The entire project is open, there is no ‘membership’ and users have just as much of a responsibility to audit code as developers actively contributing,” pseudonymous bitcoin enthusiast Shinobimonkey told CoinDesk.Such a sentiment was shared by Bitcoin Core maintainer Wladimir van der Laan who tweeted, “It was wrong that the buggy code was merged. Yes, we screwed up but the ‘we’ that screwed up is very wide. The whole community screwed up by not reviewing consensus changes thoroughly enough.”Chaincode engineer John Newberry agreed. Even though he didn’t write the buggy code, he argued that as a developer in the bitcoin world, he played a role in the error, too, by not looking closely enough.He went as far as to say that the code in question had looked funny to him. Yet, he assumed others had already checked.“Instead of verifying for myself, I trusted that people smarter and wiser than I am had it covered. I took it for granted that someone else had done the work,” he stated.Still, some argue there will always be a risk of bugs.“There’ve been bugs in bitcoin before and there’ll be bugs again. It’s just software. There’s nothing magical to it,” tweeted Blockstream COO Samson Mow.Along these lines, there’s another popular idea floating around.Today in bitcoin, there’s one main bitcoin software, Bitcoin Core, run by 95 percent of bitcoin nodes. (At least that’s according to one count – interestingly, there’s no way to see every bitcoin node, because some nodes want more privacy and don’t advertise their existence to the rest of the network.)One idea, then, is to make more bitcoin code implementations. That way if one implementation has a disastrous bug that crashes the network, the other implementations could still be fine, keeping bitcoin as a whole running.And to a certain degree, this already exists. There are lesser-known code implementations, such as Bitcoin Knots and Btcd. Elsewhere in the cryptocurrency world, this is becoming the norm. For instance, ethereum has two dominant implementations, geth and parity, each of which can be used by anyone running the software.Still, many bitcoin developers worry that adding more than one implementation could introduce problems that would be even worse than last week’s vulnerability.“What many people do not realize is that having people run different implementations makes it easier for attackers to partition the network,” Bitcoin Core contributor Andrew Chow argued in a conversation outlining the pros and cons.As such, developers don’t necessarily agree on exactly what needs to be done.Theymos perhaps put it best when he said:“I don’t know exactly how this can be prevented from happening again, but I do know that it would be a mistake for the community to brush off this bug just because it ended up being mostly harmless this time.”Metal shield image via Shutterstock"

It adds:“To facilitate the purchase of infrastructure used in their hacking activity—targeting anti-doping and other sports-related organizations and releasing the stolen documents—defendants … together with conspirators known and unknown, conspired to launder money through a web of transactions structured to capitalize on the perceived anonymity of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin.”“The use of bitcoin allowed the conspirators to avoid direct relationships with traditional financial institutions, allowing them to evade greater scrutiny of their identities and sources of funds,” it said.That being said, the indictment indicates investigators were able to track the machines used to initiate bitcoin transactions, noting that the defendants sent bitcoin payments from the same computers used to conduct some “hacking activity.”While not directly related to the ongoing investigation into suspected Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, John Demers, Assistant Attorney General for the DOJ’s national security division, said during a press conference Thursday that three of the named defendants were previously charged in connection with that probe. At the time, the named defendants were accused of using cryptocurrencies to fund and facilitate their alleged efforts.The full indictment can be read below:DOJ GRU Indictment by CoinDesk on ScribdDepartment of Justice announcement image via DOJ website"

He told CoinDesk that in the next few days, the rat would be positioned just blocks away from the Eccles Building, where the U.S. Federal Reserve system is headquartered. But that isn’t the only reason for the placement.According to Saiers, the rat will be let loose near Capitol Hill where Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman from 1987 to 2006, testified in 2008 that during his time at the central bank he had made a “mistake.”Saiers said he interprets this statement to be Greenspan conceding that he may have accidentally led the U.S. right into the 2008 financial crisis.Pointing again to Greenspan, the rat will now be wearing a Halloween mask of Greenspan with a speech balloon coming out of its mouth, saying “I made a mistake.”“Given … we were in the midst of the biggest financial crisis in 70 years it was a bit late for the guy who led the Fed … to come to this realization,” Saiers argued, adding: “Hence why I’m late to ‘trick or treat’ the Fed.”Whereas last time Saiers told CoinDesk the art is up to the interpretation of the viewer, this particular look is pretty on the nose. During the rat’s time in NYC, Saiers offered that the rat signified bitcoin taking on the existing financial system as an alternative currency option.The bitcoin white paper was released on October 31, 2008, in the midst of the crisis.Going forward, it’s not just the U.S. Federal Reserve system Saiers wants to install the rat in front of. After DC – coinciding with the 10th anniversary of bitcoin’s code release on January 9 – Saiers has tentative plans to fly to London to install the rat in front of The Bank of England.This bank is particularly special in Saiers’ eyes because it’s the one pseudonymous bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto “called out” in the message in the cryptocurrency’s genesis block – embedding a newspaper clip one of the bank bailouts.Speaking broadly about his art, Saiers concluded:“Again one of the reasons why a person may choose to invest in bitcoin is they are deeply scared of the Federal Reserve making a gigantic mistake.”Bitcoin rat image courtesy of Nelson Saiers"

I was working on graphics rendering problems requiring significant amounts of CPU power and wanted to distribute computing-intensive tasks to a network of devices.The goal was to have a number of computers performing simple tasks to contribute to a single result. Creating this system, though, was a complicated task.After the publication of Satoshi’s white paper, that’s no longer the case. Outlined in the paper was a peer-to-peer payment system poised to disrupt the financial industry, one that gave people the power to conduct transactions across a distributed network without the need for trusted middlemen.As a cryptography geek, I was enamored.Seeing the concept from my patent re-emerge nearly 20 years later, I was excited to see that now was finally the right time for this idea to succeed.At the core of this white paper was the chance to democratize value exchange. It has the ability to protect consumers should another financial crisis hit by allowing them to continue exchanging money without high interest rates and inflation. Using cryptocurrency also prevents expensive transaction fees and promotes financial inclusion, especially in developing countries.The exchange of digital assets provides the underbanked and unbanked population access to global markets that they wouldn’t have otherwise and offers a massive business opportunity for providers.The most important aspects of Satoshi’s decentralized network that aided in this democratization – transparency and consensus – are what make this such a revolutionary concept.When you pay your friend through Venmo or send a check to your landlord, you have no view into the transaction process. Satoshi wanted to provide users with the ability to know where their money was every step of the way. In that same vein, when you send your payment into the abyss, you are trusting a third party (AKA your bank of choice) to transfer your funds correctly and lawfully.The consensus protocol for bitcoin transactions requires every participant to enforce the rules, this way no one party can control what makes a transaction valid.I often compare this disruption to that of the Model T. Before it was created in 1908, cars were seen as a luxury item that most could not afford. The Model T was a practical and affordable option, democratizing the car industry. Soon after, others followed suit and started to create different types of affordable – and sometimes better – cars.Likewise, bitcoin was a catalyst for the industry, and thousands of others have since been inspired by it and iterated on blockchain technology.Maybe bitcoin won’t survive (just like the Oldsmobile), or maybe it becomes the ultimate store of value. No one knows for sure. What is clear is that there won’t be only one winner.There are, and will continue to be, different use cases for cryptocurrencies, including payments, stores of value and smart contracts – think of these as race cars, trucks and minivans, all serving a different purpose but derived from the same invention.And that’s the key – our world adjusted to the democratization of cars by building roads, highways, race tracks, and despite the hesitancy from regulators and institutions. We’ll see the same with blockchain.Without Satoshi and bitcoin, this industry wouldn’t be what it is today. But make no mistake, we are still in the very early days and will continue to see new ways to apply blockchain.It’s been over 100 years since the Model T’s creation, and the industry is still coming out with new concepts such as the driverless car and all-electric vehicles.It’s always hard to imagine what applications the future holds for new technologies, but there is a clear pattern emerging in cases where technology has drastically increased the speed of something while simultaneously decreasing its cost.The Internet did this for data exchange. We share massive amounts of data across the globe instantly and the technology is invisible. It doesn’t matter where in the world you are or how much you want to share – it is just something we can do now.Blockchain is doing this for payments. If the pattern holds, the next decade will bring an explosion of low-cost, high-speed payments that will transform value exchange the way the Internet transformed information exchange. Payments will just be something we can do now.Model T image via Shutterstock"

by ...","Sep 13, 2018 at 04:00 UTC","Hank Paulson, former secretary of the U.S. Treasury, called it “an economic 9/11.”","Having loaded up on mortgage debt that went sour, then failed to find a savior in the government or private sector, the 158-year-old Wall Street investment bank Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy on Sept. 15, 2008.The fallout over the following days, weeks and months would threaten to topple the entire financial system, necessitating trillions of dollars in rescue lending to banks and other firms by governments and central banks. The global financial system hadn’t looked more fragile at any point since 1929.Worse, support for the system was undermined by the fact that Wall Street executives still collected multimillion-dollar bonuses – even as millions of the taxpayers, who helped fund those bonuses, lost their homes.Within a couple of months of Lehman’s bankruptcy, though, a new piece of technology would debut – almost unnoticed – one that appeared to offer an alternative to this catastrophe-prone system. On October 31, 2008, an unidentified individual going by the name Satoshi Nakamoto published the bitcoin white paper to a cryptography mailing list.The paper described “a purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash [that] would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.”Satoshi had almost certainly been working on the protocol for months or years prior to Lehman’s collapse but, according to Cornell computer science professor and blockchain researcher Emin Gun Sirer, there was a timely motive to the launch.Sirer told CoinDesk:“It’s very clear that Satoshi was affected by the events that led up to the financial crisis of 2008, and then it’s obviously recorded in the genesis block as well.”Sirer is referring to the Times of London headline bitcoin’s creator pointedly inserted into the first bitcoin block ever mined, on Jan. 3, 2009: “Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.”As awareness of bitcoin spread, different people saw different things in it, but for many, it represented an alternative to fiat currency issued by central banks (which had just fired up the proverbial printing presses again) and the fractional reserve banking system (which had nearly collapsed beneath a mountain of lending).Most of all, it promised to bypass the financial institutions the crisis had cast such doubt on.Laszlo Hanyecz, known as “Bitcoin Pizza Guy” for becoming the first person to use the cryptocurrency to purchase real-world goods (two pizzas for 10,000 BTC in May 2010), told CoinDesk that he believed bitcoin could replace “the established system of banks and the endless line of middlemen all taking a cut.”Yet over the past decade, the worlds of bitcoin – and its cryptocurrency and blockchain offshoots – and traditional finance have begun to interact in ways almost no one would have predicted early on.Wall Street veterans are decamping to work for firms focused on cryptocurrency. Major financial institutions are flirting with blockchain. And cryptocurrency investors are pushing for the creation of investment vehicles by industry incumbents.Ten years after bitcoin was born into the flames of the financial crisis, have the cryptocurrency community and Wall Street made nice?Early on, the ethos around bitcoin was undeniably subversive.One early adopter and miner, who asked to remain anonymous, told CoinDesk that “in the very beginning” there was “a great deal of discussion about the anarcho-capitalist and/or libertarian ideals” that bitcoin appeared to make possible.He mentioned dark web markets such as Silk Road, which used bitcoin, but noted that these rested on a misunderstanding of the protocol’s limited anonymity.Even ignoring its illicit use cases, though, the creation of decentralized money appeared to pose a threat to the established order. It provided, the early adopter said, an escape from “the interpersonal and cultural damage and destruction done by the monetary monopolies” – meaning banks and governments.Taariq Lewis, a long-time cryptocurrency developer whose most recent project is codenamed Lyra Protocols, agreed that “bitcoin was always meant to bypass the financial system.”As such, some early bitcoiners worried that participating in such a project could be dangerous.Stefan Thomas, who discovered bitcoin through the random-browsing site StumbleUpon in 2010, and then went on to work as Ripple’s CTO before starting his own venture, told CoinDesk:“A lot of people early on in the bitcoin community were very worried that central banks would look at this as a fundamental threat to one of the key, key, pillars of power of the government, which is the ability to issue currency. And so a lot of people early on stayed anonymous, they did not reveal their real identities.”As it turns out, he said, most of the supposed central bank “illuminati” were simply curious about the new technology.Although, that’s not to say that mavens of established finance haven’t lashed out on occasion. Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan’s CEO since before the crisis, has called bitcoin a “fraud,” though he’s since walked that statement back. And Warren Buffett, the billionaire investor who bailed Goldman Sachs out in the week following Lehman’s bankruptcy, has called bitcoin “rat poison squared.”To be sure, for all the hope it’s inspired (and acrimony it’s generated), bitcoin is far from toppling the incumbent financial system.Wall Street banks – most of them – not only survived the crisis, but have grown bigger than they ever were before it. Central banks and fiat money show no signs of going anywhere, and bitcoin remains a tiny sliver of the global monetary system.“It’s turned out,” said Sirer, “that undoing the Fed and replacing money as we know it is actually a tall order, and it has to happen in stages if it’s going to happen at all.”In the meantime, he added, “There’s a lot to be had from playing nice with the existing system and making it better.”The view that bitcoin and traditional finance are anything but oil and water – unthinkable when bitcoin was young and the crisis’ wounds were raw – is now practically mainstream.Thomas described the shift in thinking over the past five years.In 2013, he said, Ripple was one of the first to think about taking blockchain into the enterprise space, and the typical reaction to that from that time period ran:“What the hell are you doing? This is the opposite of the whole point of this. The point is you don’t need a bank, why would you work with one?”He usually replied that banks are where consumers keep their money, so it “isn’t so realistic” to expect that to change soon.Tone Vays, a cryptocurrency researcher and consultant who worked at the investment bank Bear Stearns prior to its March 2008 collapse, and subsequently became a VP at JPMorgan Chase, made a similar point.“Most people aren’t ready yet to be in control of their own private keys,” he said.Far from eliminating middlemen, Vays said, the bitcoin ecosystem will have its own banks – in fact, it already does, in the form of Coinbase and other big exchanges.Nic Carter, who worked as a research analyst for the asset manager Fidelity before joining the cryptocurrency venture capital firm Castle Island Ventures, said much the same thing. Bitcoin demonstrated that “money and state can be separate,” he said, but added, “I don’t think bitcoin is incompatible with banks.”That sentiment is typical of a new generation of bitcoin, cryptocurrency and blockchain enthusiasts and professionals.Many of them, noted Amber Baldet, who worked as JPMorgan’s blockchain program lead before leaving to co-found a new blockchain startup, are “not necessarily of the same initial philosophy that captured the hearts and minds of early users.”In fact, Baldet, Vays and Carter have all previously worked in traditional finance.“Coming from the world of traditional finance, I am quite optimistic about the intersection of the two,” said Carter. “I think cryptocurrency will eventually be financialized and will be custodied by large institutions, regulated markets will emerge, along with all the hallmarks of what will become essentially a vibrant virtual commodity market.”Indeed, many in the cryptocurrency community appear to be welcoming the entrance of financial incumbents – for instance, bitcoin investors are holding their breath for SEC decisions regarding proposed bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).It’s worth noting, though, that despite signs of rapprochement, some in the cryptocurrency community remain wary of Wall Street, central banks and the like.“Bankers are experts on all the different kinds of market abuse and they are kept honest by market surveillance and government oversight,” Hanyecz said. “In bitcoin markets, anything goes, so I think bitcoiners would be wise to consider that before wishing for more institutional involvement.”And Carter cautioned that “bitcoiners will have to be vigilant that bitcoin itself is not totally co-opted.”But for Zooko Wilcox, old school cypherpunk and CEO of the Zcash Company, the point of cryptocurrency is not to “convert everyone else in the world to share our revolutionary fervor.” Rather it’s to provide people with “something they need – a fairer, safer, and more efficient financial system.”The kind of system, in other words, that Lehman’s bankruptcy proved the world didn’t have.Cryptocurrency “began with a small group of hardcore revolutionaries,” Wilcox said, but:“Success will mean billions of people finding cryptocurrency to be convenient and reliable without ever understanding either the scientific or the political revolutions behind it.”Occupy protester image via Daryl L / Shutterstock"

But this latest rat has been updated for modern times. Instead of a dull brown, it’s covered in colorful code and math equations in an ode to bitcoin.The massive art piece was just installed as a sort of “protest” designed to get viewers to think critically about the state of economics and money management. “Bitcoin will take you apart,” the rat seems to argue from its perch in front of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s iconic stone exterior. On its piercing blue eyes, its pupils spell out the letters “PoW,” short for proof-of-work, bitcoin’s underlying algorithm.Not a permanent installation, it’s expected to be on display for a few days according to artist and ex-hedge fund manager Nelson Saiers, who wants to use the piece to direct attention to The Fed, perhaps the world’s most powerful bank because it controls the U.S. dollar.While this control is intended to keep the U.S. economy running smoothly, critics argue that central banks devalue money and that it’s inner-mechanics aren’t as transparent as they should be (an opinion that has a lot of clout in bitcoin circles).As if a giant rat staring angrily at the Federal Reserve didn’t make this point already, Saiers specifically chose to set loose his creation on Maiden Lane, named after the entity that bailed out the giant companies AIG and Bear Stearns during the 2008 financial crisis.But while rats have a long history in protest, it arguably carries added symbolism for cryptocurrency enthusiasts. Remember the time Warren Buffet called bitcoin “rat poison squared?”You could think of the art installation as a kind of commentary on that, too.Saiers told CoinDesk:“Warren Buffett called bitcoin ‘rat poison squared’ but if the Fed’s a rat, then maybe rat poison is a good thing.”But if his latest project draws more than a few confused stares this week, know this sort of protest art isn’t exactly new for Saiers.Actually, the former mathematician has earned the nickname “The Warhol of Wall Street” with paintings that depict the darker side of finance, including the market crashes and other complexities that can impact greatly those who understand it the least.Saiers’ work has aimed to go beyond critiquing money. He’s also taken a stand against non-violent drug crimes by hanging football jerseys spelling out the first 100 or so digits of pi (the connection, in his mind, being that pi is an irrational number and arresting someone for smoking pot is similarly “irrational”.)However, this is his first piece related to bitcoin. While at first glance it might look like it, it’s really not an anti-Wall Street art piece. The rat is art, after all, so it’s really up to the viewer’s interpretation.But Saiers gives viewers a few things to think about. For one, he thinks the rat gets the bitcoin philosophy across in an easy to understand way. “The sculpture’s supposed to kind of reflect the spirit of Satoshi and what he’s trying to do,” Saiers said, adding that bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator seemed to be “against bailouts,” like the one in 2008.(When he or she first created and launched the cryptocurrency, they stuck a news clip of a bailout in the first block of the bitcoin blockchain, to be stored there forever, which many interpret as a criticism of banking and government ties.)Saiers sees his art as a way for onlookers to learn about bitcoin and the Federal Reserve – both of them. “They each have their strengths and weaknesses. Satoshi is obviously very talented. The Fed has lots of talented people as well,” he said, not advocating for one or the other, even if they seem like conflictingIn short, he just wants people to just enjoy the silliness of it and maybe learn a thing or two.“It’s art, so I hope they’re entertained by it. It’s informative, I hope people will learn [and] I’m hoping it’ll at least help people understand bitcoin better and be kind of faithful to what Satoshi would have wanted,” he said.As for whether this could be achieved with a more attractive piece of art, Saiers seems most keen on making an impression. (“Bitcoin has left economics and has entered the public consciousness,” Saiers argued.)Similarly, people sure seemed curious about the rat, with many passersby snapping selfies with it already. When Saiers and his friends first put up it up, they accidentally put it on private land. The security guards chased them off to the public sidewalk. But they did so kindly, as they all “got a kick out of the rat,” he said.Again, Saiers isn’t expecting much controversy. Part of the fun (he believes) is that the art is ambiguous. In his mind, it’s unclear whether bitcoin or the Federal Reserve is the rat.Saiers sees one other interesting connection. Like Satoshi, the famous street artist Banksy is pseudonymous, and he speaks about rats very fondly.“They exist without permission. They are hated, hunted and persecuted. They live in quiet desperation amongst the filth. And yet they are capable of bringing entire civilizations to their knees. If you are dirty, insignificant and unloved then rats are the ultimate role model,” Banksy wrote in his book “Wall and Peace.”Saiers thinks bitcoin might prove similar.“People have been mocking bitcoin, but now it’s a $100 billion entity. It’s been scorned, but will it play a role in dampening the importance of central banks and fiat currencies?” Saiers said, adding:“I’m not saying it will! But that’s why I chose a rat.”White rat sculpture image via CoinDesk"

When bringing coins back to the online hot wallet, however, the program requires multi-party signatures to initiate a transaction.Further, Menghrajani said the solution can also enforce certain preset rules, such as only sending bitcoin from the cold storage to Square-owned addresses.“The HSM is programmable, allowing us to support bitcoin wallets today while giving us the flexibility to implement other protocols in the future,” he added.Square, founded by the co-founder and CEO of Twitter Jack Dorsey, first announced the launch of a bitcoin trading service via its Cash App in November last year.The firm further expanded the bitcoin trading function to all 50 states in the U.S. in August this year after the business unit booked small margins for the firm in the first two quarters in 2018.Jack Dorsey image via Shutterstock"

type of ...","Oct 21, 2018 at 09:20 UTC","Ofir Beigel is the general manager of 99 Bitcoins, an informational site for newcomers to the space.","In November 2015, I started operating 99Bitcoins’ faucet. Almost three years later, on Oct. 8, I shut it down.Throughout its history, the faucet paid out over 12.795 bitcoins to its users. Here’s its story.Faucets are a type of website that work on traffic arbitrage. It means you “buy” traffic cheap and sell it expensive. It works as follows:As long as “Money paid to visitors” < “Money received from advertisers,” you’re profitable.The first faucet was actually created back in 2010 as a way of giving people free bitcoins to spread the word about it. You may not believe it, but back then that faucet gave out 5 whole bitcoins for each new visitor.Today faucets have evolved into different forms which I will cover in this post, but the concept stays the same: get cheap traffic, sell it for more. Of course, in the beginning, there were only bitcoin faucets but today there is a faucet for almost every major cryptocurrency out there.I started 99Bitcoins’ faucet as a side project. I bought an already existing faucet called “Bitcoin Genie” which back then was making around $300 a month and wanted to see if I can make something more out of it.I actually documented my complete journey in a series of blog posts so I’m not going to repeat what I’ve already put down on paper. I will just give you a short breakdown with references to the original posts.My first step consisted of actually building the faucet. Back then you have to know a little bit of code, but today there are various faucet plugins out there for WordPress that you can use (including one by 99Bitcoins).The first lessons I’ve learned revolved around how to set up the faucet. Mainly, what should be the time interval between user payouts and how much should I pay each time?The fact that cryptocurrency fluctuates a lot in price makes it hard to determine a fixed amount in crypto you want to pay users. If that specific coin suddenly appreciates drastically in price (just like bitcoin did at the end of 2016), you end up paying a lot more than you intended.That’s why later on I moved on to a form of payment that is stated in U.S. dollars and not in BTC, meaning users would get paid in BTC but the amount they would earn is a static USD amount. This is important since you’re earning revenues in fiat and at the end of the day, you want to compare revenues and expenses in the same type of currency.Initially, my main source of income was Google AdSense. This means that Google would show its ads on the faucet and I would get paid by them at the end of the month. Back then it was still unclear to me if this was allowed by Google but I took a chance and decided to check it out.After some additional tweaking to the site, I managed to earn a few hundred bucks a month with it. Additionally, I found out that you can use captcha services to earn money, so I added a captcha to the faucet. This helped prevent spam requests and also added an additional revenue stream.But the story was far from over.In March 2016, I managed to make over $1,500.At the height of its career, the faucet managed to net nearly $2,000 a month on almost complete autopilot. I recently made my complete revenue documentation public so you can see my exact calculations here.Then everything changed…In May 2016, Google banned my faucet from the AdSense program. Apparently, faucets are a form of incentivized traffic, which I wasn’t aware of at the time. This was a devastating blow to my main revenue stream and I had to find alternatives.Once banned from AdSense, I set out to find other ad networks that would supply a good revenue stream. I found several options but things weren’t the same as before. The revenues were substantially lower and the ad quality was more often than not very poor. In order to make a decent profit, I had to use pop-ups and promote spammy products.In the end, I decided to let the faucet run on a “break even” model. Meaning I didn’t earn anything but didn’t lose anything. I also didn’t have to promote anything I didn’t feel comfortable with to survive.Somewhere around March 2018 I removed the ads completely and decided to run the faucet at a loss. Why did I do this?I think that at this point 99Bitcoins as a whole was doing pretty well and the hassle it took to round up my revenue from the faucet wasn’t worth my time. So I decided to lose around $500/month and still run the faucet pro bono.The faucet was a good testing ground for various business models. For example, we tried implementing browser mining at some point, but soon found out it wasn’t profitable as well.Also, since we were maintaining our crypto faucet plugin for WordPress, I needed a working faucet to see it was working properly.Eventually, in September of this year I decided that the faucet was taking too many resources from our company (payments, development, customer support) and we shut it down on October 8.A lot of people are asking if running a faucet is still profitable. I believe you can still run a faucet in a profitable way, but you’ll need to work hard at it and I’m not sure it can be done in a “clean” way.Most of the major faucets I know of are no longer around. Those that are seem to be promoting a lot of junk. But the fact that faucets like Moon Bitcoin or Bonus Bitcoin are still around (and have been for a very long time) shows that the business model is viable.I think that today, in order to stay profitable with a faucet, you need to:Aside from the classic bitcoin faucet approach, there are many other sites that are doing something similar but not identical. Here are some examples:As you can see, you can get quite creative with this as long as you keep the simple formula of money spent on traffic < money earned on traffic.The downside with these types of projects is that usually, you have to code them from zero. There aren’t any “out of the box” plugins or scripts for sites that aren’t a normal faucet.To sum it up, running 99Bitcoins’ faucet was a great experience. I can’t say that it was immensely profitable but I did learn a lot in the process and managed to help people earn bitcoins for free, which is awesome.Faucets are unique in that they represent the first time we can distribute mass micropayments with relative ease and this is something that can serve many online platforms.So I don’t think this industry will die completely, it will just evolve. For example, there are already lightning network implementations in place.Faucet image via Shutterstock"

The opportunities of the blockchain are many, but the problems of bitcoin are also plentiful. I believe that Agustín Carstens summed its manifold problems up well when he said that bitcoin is ‘a combination of a bubble, a Ponzi scheme and an environmental disaster.'”Despite bitcoin’s issues, central banks can take advantage of distributed ledger technology to possibly issue central bank-backed digital currencies (CBDCs), he went on to add.Some banks have already begun exploring the concept of central bank digital currencies, with 69 percent of central banks already – or at least planning to in the near future – studying how these may be used to aid national monetary systems.In particular, he said, about 57 percent of central banks already studying CBDCs see two main potential applications. The first is specifically for high-value transactions, such as interbank transfers, whereas the second would be more general, for everyday consumers to spend.Banks are also finding that there is “a potential for cross-border remittances-related payment services” aspect.“There is broad agreement that a CBDC, in whatever form, is unlikely to be issued within the next decade, even among those four central banks that have indicated that they have reached the stage of developing a pilot project,” he said.

in hash power will allow Bitcoin SV to launch attacks against the ...","Nov 15, 2018 at 05:00 UTC",Bitcoin cash’s ongoing war of words is set to reach a conclusion today.,"That’s when a planned technical update (and an ongoing disagreement over the proposed code changes) may lead two major bitcoin cash implementations – Bitcoin ABC and Bitcoin SV – to split into separate blockchains.In the days prior to the activation, rising contention from both camps has culminated in what has been termed as “hash war,” as mining pools ramp up their computing power to show support for the various implementations.But rather than a future in which the two versions of bitcoin cash live in harmony, there’s a degree of concern that, under a scenario in which two distinct blockchains emerge, that same mining power could be wielded as a weapon against one of the networks.“An SV miner can even legally kill off a chain. That is the miner’s right. This is what bitcoin is,” Craig Wright, the controversial chief scientist behind nChain, the company that leads the Bitcoin SV implementation, tweeted.Hash power – the computing resources committed by miners toward securing a blockchain – has been fluctuating between both camps in the days prior to the activation, though all signs point to Bitcoin SV proponents having the upper hand on this front.Because of bitcoin cash’s underlying architecture, a 51 percent dominance in hash power will allow Bitcoin SV to launch attacks against the minority chain – and Wright has suggested that such action isn’t off the table.As such, according to Peter Rizun, the chief scientist of Bitcoin Unlimited (a bitcoin cash software implementation that supports Bitcoin ABC), the upcoming hash war is a test of what is known as bitcoin’s underlying security assumption, dubbed the “honest majority.”Detailed in the Satoshi Nakamoto white paper, the honest majority assumption is based on the premise that security is only guaranteed if 51 percent – or a majority – of nodes are behaving non-maliciously.“The security of blockchains come from economic incentives, not from math. We cross our fingers and hope that a group of attacker nodes will choose to play by the rules. Maybe they won’t,” Rizun said, adding:“The coming hash battle is putting Satoshi’s assumption to the test.”In effect, Wright sees the upcoming split in terms of bitcoin’s longest chain rule – the underlying bitcoin consensus mechanism that defaults to the longest chain in the event of multiple blocks being found simultaneously.When applied to a blockchain split, what this means essentially means is a fight to the death between the competing chains, where the last one standing would be considered the “true” bitcoin cash by nodes.For example, both implementations have declined to add so-called “replay protection,” or code that allows funds to be safely spent when a split occurs.“Neither Bitcoin SV nor Bitcoin ABC have implemented transaction replay protection, as the intention is for only one chain to survive,” nChain, the software company behind Bitcoin SV, wrote in a press release published earlier this month.This means that without special precautions, users could lose funds while transacting on a split chain. Similarly, hackers can exploit the vulnerability to extract funds from exchanges.“Users potentially stand to lose money because of this decision,” Chris Pacia, a developer for OpenBazaar, told CoinDesk, adding: “Not adding replay protection is a dick move.”And there are other ways that the two blockchains could continue to wage war following the fork – especially if one camp continues to dominate the hash power.At the time of writing, the prevailing hash rate is showing a preference for the SV side. If the preference continues, there’s a host of ways that Bitcoin SV could try to keep ABC from operating.For example, SV could mine empty blocks that do not contain transactions.Combined with a majority hash rate, this could result in user transactions being rejected from the chain, essentially pushing the blockchain into stasis. According to Rizun, the cost of this attack “is nearly zero for SV, assuming they have majority hash power.”For the honest minority, however, the cost is extremely high.“They spend a lot of resources to find a block, only to have it orphaned and lose the 12.5 BCH block reward. The honest miners might give up,” Rizun explained.Alternatively, the miner could simply include useless or “junk” transactions into the blockchain, which would have a similar effect to empty blocks, but according to Chris Pacia, this approach also “forces people to validate and store all the junk transactions.”Equally, having a 51 percent majority means that SV attackers could perform a so-called “double-spend attack,” in which an attacker prints non-existent funds from an exchange.A notorious attack within the cryptocurrency industry, such an attack requires the majority of hash power to function.Given the hash power, a miner can produce blocks in secret that contain false transactions before injecting the transactions into the blockchain.Still,  in this case, Rizun depicted this attack as one of the least likely outcomes of the bitcoin cash fork, because, unlike hostile activity between competing chains, double-spends are “blatantly criminal.”And there are other attacks that could be launched between the blockchains as well.According to Pacia, it is also possible for an attacker with the majority hash rate to let the ABC chain grow, before using the majority hash power to override blocks.“This would cause users, especially exchanges, to lose millions of dollars as they would see their transactions get reversed. [Wright] has threatened to do this,” Pacia said.Additionally, Rizun listed “poison-block attack, denial-of-service attacks, network-partition attacks, and zero-day exploits,” among the kinds of activity that could arise between the warring factions.For example, rumors have been building ahead of the release about something that has been nicknamed “Satoshi’s shotgun” – which would inject large volumes of spam transactions into the competing chain. Spam transactions would flood the blockchain, slowing the time that it takes for standard transactions to be confirmed.“We saw [Satoshi’s shotgun] in action on Nov. 10. Apparently, it generated up to 800 transactions per second,” Rizun said.Continuing, Rizun explained a further possibility – what he calls a “fair fight” – in which SV would simply prevent the changes that ABC intends to make from activating.Another attack that requires the majority of hash rate in order to function, SV could mine blocks that are valid to both implementations but would punish miners that attempt to activate ABC changes by simply refusing to include them in a block.“This way, SV could try to bleed the ABC-loyal miners dry until they give up on the changes,” Rizun said.Such an attack would prevent ABC from activating and ensure that SV becomes dominate on the bitcoin cash blockchain. According to Rizun, this is the most sensible and cost-efficient form of attack, but “also probably the most technically difficult to implement.”“[It’s] only really a good option if they actually care about BCH. If SV wants to destroy BCH, then [it] would not be a good option,” Rizun said.And while it’s unclear how Thursday’s hard fork will play out, according to Rizun, such attacks are “exciting,” because they allow blockchains to be battle-tested in more robust scenarios.“People think you just make a blockchain and it becomes secure by some mathematical pixie dust. It doesn’t,” Rizun said, concluding:“We don’t know if blockchains work. That might sound odd, but it’s true.”Bitcoin miners via Shutterstock"

bitcoin downturns and subsequent bitcoin/tether trading volumes ...","Sep 21, 2018 at 12:00 UTC","The issuance of tether (USDT), the controversial cryptocurrency tied to the U.S. dollar’s value, has had no meaningful impact on the price of bitcoin, an academic study has found.","The findings by Dr. Wang Chun Wei, a lecturer at the business school of Australia’s University of Queensland, contradict widespread and long-running speculation that Tether, the company behind the stable cryptocurrency, has been issuing USDT to pump up the price of bitcoin.Wei’s findings have been accepted for the October 2018 issue of Economics Letters. (The paper was originally published online in May.)In the paper, “The Impact of Tether Grants on Bitcoin,” he writes:“Our findings show that tether grants were potentially timed to follow bitcoin downturns and subsequent bitcoin/tether trading volumes increased … However, the impact of tether grants on bitcoin returns were not statistically significant, and therefore tether issuances cannot be an effective tool for moving bitcoin prices.”Tether is the market’s leading stablecoin. It maintains a steady price of about $1, ostensibly by backing each USDT with one U.S. dollar in reserve – though this claim is often disputed and hard to verify since Tether has not published a full audit. While the token has been valuable to exchanges, at least one top-20 exchange has recently moved to shift to a new alternative.Wei’s research focuses on the volume of USDT in the market and changes to that volume. It does not address controversies around the amount of U.S. dollars actually backing USDT.“This is for regulators and auditors to determine,” Wei writes.Instead, the paper simply addresses whether or not the issuance of new USDT could be used to manipulate the price of the world’s largest cryptocurrency. That critique of USDT has been articulated by the anonymous author of January’s “The Tether Report,” who wrote:“The highly correlated growth between tether issuance and bitcoin price raises several interesting questions: Is bitcoin growth driving Tether? Is tether issuance driving bitcoin? If one were to assume the worst case scenario, that bitcoin’s price has been artificially pumped up by tether issuance, one would expect the market price of bitcoin to be closer to $2,000 based on the trendline before April 2017 and the marked growth in tether issuance.”Tether Limited issues new USDT periodically in large lots typically referred to as grants. According to Wei: “The grants seem to occur in groups. I think Tether Limited breaks the grants into smaller blocks and issues them out over a couple of days.”Wei summarized the critique of Tether Limited’s detractors for CoinDesk, writing:“If tether tokens were not fully backed, then for the company to issue new tokens would be equivalent of printing money. If this was true, tether grants/issuances would be equivalent to ‘monetary easing’ in the cryptocurrency markets.”In monetary or quantitative easing, an increased money supply aims to boost economic activity by expanding liquidity.“It was argued that most of the increased Tether was used to purchase bitcoin,” Wei explained. “My paper tries to test this theory out empirically. Is it true that tether grants pushed up bitcoin prices?”The paper notes that bitcoin-tether trading pairs dominate across major exchanges and that more than $2 billion worth of USDT exists on the market. Further, it notes that trading in bitcoin does increase following new USDT grants. Nevertheless, that observation can be misleading.Acknowledging that trading volume is correlated with price, Wei went on to say: “However, you cannot use trading volume to predict price, as the effect is simultaneous. In my paper, I state that past trading volumes do not impact future returns.”To investigate these questions, Wei used two time-series models to input different variables over time and see if there was a causal relationship. The models specifically looked for evidence of changes going forward from new grants.He uses an “autoregressive distributed lag” model and also an “unrestricted vector autoregression” (VAR). Both of these are ways of investigating whether or not there is a causal relationship between something in the past and something in the future.Wei broke it down in layman’s terms: “We have a null model that tries to explain bitcoin returns using past bitcoin returns. We have a full model that tries to explain bitcoin returns using past bitcoin returns and past tether grants.”He summarized:“We then show the full model isn’t actually any better than the null model. Hence, past tether grants must have no impact on bitcoin returns.”In other words, when you add variables about USDT, it doesn’t show any direct impact on BTC returns any better than just looking at BTC on its own.“In fact, when we examine the bitcoin return equation of our VAR model, none of the lagged variables impacts bitcoin returns. This suggests bitcoin returns are showing greater signs of market efficiency than previously studied on older datasets,” Wei writes in the paper.Wei went on to argue that this makes intuitive sense, once the size of the bitcoin market is considered.“The grants come roughly at $100-250 million blocks. The daily trading volume of bitcoin is roughly $5-10 billion USD. At its peak, it was roughly $20 billion,” he told CoinDesk. “So the impact of tether is small. Claims saying that it is tether that props up bitcoin are definitely not true.”Prices on screen image via Shutterstock"

Coinbase says this wastes company time in pointless support requests and provides users with a “frustrating experience.”The reason fees rise and fall so readily is that rather than clawing back transaction costs via a percentage – as card firms like Visa and Mastercard do – bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies pay miners a fee to confirm transactions. And that’s based on a model not dissimilar to bidding at an auction.At times when the bitcoin network is busiest, miners have a queue of transactions to process and these are prioritized by dealing with the transactions offering the highest fee first.But the method can cause lengthy delays before transactions are confirmed and the funds have “arrived.” It can also cause spiking fees at the busiest times, as was seen in late 2017 when the price shot up to an all-time high of around $20,000.To address the issue, Coinbase says it has turned to a procedure which uses economic incentives built into the bitcoin protocol for improving confirmation time of transactions.“Child Pays for Parent” (CPFP), as it is called, has been rolled out at across the company’ systems in the last few months.CPFP works by following up a stalled bitcoin transaction (with a fee too low for the current market to want to process immediately) with a so called “child” transaction – a later transaction linked to the original “parent” transaction, and in this case, set to offer a higher fee.Since bitcoin mining clients will often batch a group of transactions, adding a better-rewarding child transaction can cause the parent to be processed sooner, the post indicates.Coinbase says that the process kicks in after a payment has been stuck for “at least 4 blocks” and has at times been used to automatically “rescue thousands of transactions in a single day.”The exchange adds that CPFP is carried out without the need for interaction from the customer and the results have been “really positive” so far.Delays image via Shutterstock"

During the same time, longs – or positions that are betting on an increase in bitcoin’s price – also witnessed a notable increase of 10 percent, the current number of which (24,410) marks a three-week high. Indeed, the sentiment here seems to be shifting in favor of the bulls. The price of bitcoin broke bearish from a historically tight, two-week range of just $139 on Oct. 29, yet sellers were not able to further capitalize on the bearish outcome. As a result, the price of bitcoin has risen roughly 4 percent since then to return to the range and negate the technically bearish view in the short term. What’s more, bitcoin bulls have market seasonality on their side. The fourth quarter of the fiscal year is traditionally bullish for bitcoin prices, specifically the month of November. Data reveals that bitcoin has only concluded November with a monthly percent loss once since 2010, in 2011. Looking at the chart below, it’s perhaps no coincidence that shorts began their more-than-30 percent drop just a day before November began.BTC/USD Longs, Shorts, and PriceWhen a short or long trade becomes overcrowded, it tends to represent overbought or oversold market conditions. For example, a short squeeze, or rapid price increase occurs when an abundance of shorts are forced to cover in order to avoid a losing trading. The same can occur for longs, too. If there are an abundance of longs and price begins to fall, those longing will likely need to close their trade and as result drive the price of the underlying asset lower and faster. Although BTC shorts have taken a hit as of late, an abundance of longs has yet to pile up. Data shows only 53 percent of the leverage positions on Bitfinex are longs, meaning 47 percent are shorts. The relatively even ratio shows longs are not yet an overwhelming favorite, but it’s worth keeping in mind that the higher the percentage of longs, the more likely the price of bitcoin is to experience a pullback in the near term due to the overbought market conditions it would create, as was witnessed at the beginning of September.

On social media, allegations emerged Bitmain was everything from insolvent to presenting a rosy outlook for its financials, all the while investors linked to the funding effort backed away from the deal.Now it appears Bitmain is facing a new and well-capitalized competitor.Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, Bitewei, a Shenzhen-based mining chip manufacturer led by Yang Zuoxing, the former director of design at Bitmain, has raised 140 million yuan (around $20 million) to bring to market mining chips that long-time mining industry insiders believe could lead it to rival at least one area of Bitmain’s business.Tyler Xiong, COO of the bitcoin mining pool operator Bixin, which joined Bitewei’s initial investment, told CoinDesk that it believes the company’s Whatsminer line of mining chips to be “a game changer.”Founded in Shenzhen in July 2016, Bitewei is now considered by some to be the most efficient hardware manufacturer on the market.According to test results published by Bitewei, the upcoming WhatsMiner M10 is roughly 30 percent more efficient, in terms of electricity consumption than Bitmain’s most recent flagship product the AntMiner S9 Hydro. Yang told CoinDesk Bitewei has so far received pre-orders of over 1,000 units of Whatsminer M10, a product scheduled to officially launch on September 19, but that started its pre-sale in mid August. With an average price around $1,600 depending on the shipping batch, the new product could already be generating a revenue beyond $1.6 million.That said, Bitewei admittedly has a long way to go, as IPO materials suggest Bitmain controls 85 percent of the global cryptocurrency mining hardware market. Further, it has a well-developed software-based business, with its BTC.com and Antpool mining pools providing mining tools to 30 percent of the network’s miners.This large market share is viewed with skepticism by cryptocurrency developers, who believe it conflicts with efforts to open access to cryptocurrency protocols and the digital monetary rewards they create.As such, the fact that hardware distributors are already selling Whatsminer products has created excitement among those who believe the rise of additional, competitive mining chip providers could benefit the industry while better ensuring its ethos.David Vorick, CEO of Obelisk, a company that set out to challenge Bitmain with an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) miner for the Siacoin cryptocurrency, said he believes Bitewei proves that competition is possible, if difficult to achieve.Vorick told CoinDesk: “There should be a lot more players in the bitcoin mining space and a lot more manufacturers, especially if we can figure out everything that Whatsminer is doing to get the efficiency gains that they’ve been getting.”Others, however, say efficiency isn’t everything, and that Bitewei must still prove it can execute, avoiding the pitfalls that have seen other mining firms go bankrupt despite competitive products.“It takes a lot, luck included, for a company to grow to that size and influence,” Xiong said, comparing Bitewei to Bitmain. “It’s hard for a new hardware company to get that influence now. Besides, there are only 4 million bitcoins left to mine.”Still, Bitewei’s test results suggest its product far exceeds the current norm.Ahead of the Whatsminer M10’s formal launch, Bitewei kicked off the pre-sale by publishing two rounds of testing results on August 10 and 25, respectively. In both cases, Bitewei claimed the machine was performing at a level that consumed 66 watts to 68 watts of electricity per 1 trillion hashes (66W/TH).In comparison, according to the official specifics published by Bitmain about its latest AntMiner S9 Hydro, the mining giant’s flagship product has a power consumption that’s around 96 W/TH.Speaking of growing competition from other bitcoin miners that recently launched products featuring 7nm chips, including Canaan Creative and GMO Internet, Yang said his next step is also to roll out a 7nm-chip bitcoin miner in 2019.Yet, Vorick said he believes Bitewei now has a considerable edge compared to both other startups and incumbent competitors, as Yang’s 50-people team combines experience with cutting-edge chip designs. “It seems like the majority of the design talent at Bitmain is now at Whatsminer [Bitewei],” Vorick said.  Perhaps that’s why Yang doesn’t appear deterred by fierce competition during the summer’s overall bearish crypto market, with bitcoin’s price sliding below $7,000. “The market always has ups and downs and 2018 is somewhat like 2014, during which the bitcoin price kept declining for a year,” Yang told CoinDesk. He added:“Nothing can stop the enthusiasm for people inside the industry. Outsiders may hesitate, like Intel or NVIDIA, but not us.”Bolstering the enthusiasm for the company is that this isn’t Yang’s first industry effort, as his experience with bitcoin mining started long before he joined Bitmain.After earning a Ph.D. in engineering physics from China’s Tsinghua University, Yang started in 2014 as a chip designer at ASICMiner, a bitcoin miner maker founded in 2012 by Jiang Xinyu – a.k.a Friedcat on bitcointalk.org – whose unexplained disappearance in January 2015 is still one of the bitcoin industry’s unsolved mysteries.Promptly after Friedcat’s disappearance, Yang presented his full-custom chip design to Micree Zhan, co-founder and chairman of the Beijing-based Bitmain. It was the design that would soon become Bitmain’s Antminer S7, as Yang joined Bitmain’s team in the spring of 2015. The full-custom methodology adopted by Yang, in layman’s terms, allows a designer working with integrated circuits to completely customize the layout of each transistor and how they connect to each other. The benefit is that, as opposed to other methods such as semi-custom which uses pre-designed layout to some extent, the full-custom method allows a designer with the right skill-set to maximize the chip’s output at the lowest point of power consumption. But, as Yang told CoinDesk, this method is also highly costly and time-consuming. That’s why it is best suited to large-scale production, like Bitmain’s factories. It could have been a perfect match. However, Yang said he decided to move from Bitmain’s Beijing’s office back to Shanghai after just two weeks because he didn’t fit in with Bitmain’s “working environment,” adding he “didn’t feel respected.”  So he continued working part-time on designing the Antminer S7, balancing that remote job with a new side project of his own.After Bitmain officially rolled out Antminer S7 in August 2015, Yang said he had five rounds of negotiations with Bitmain about equity, all while keeping control of his designs for the Antminer S9 for the company, soon to be Bitmain’s flagship product (revealed in May 2016).Yang said while Jihan Wu – also co-founder of Bitmain – agreed to offer him 2 percent of Bitmain’s equity, Zhan did not go along with that plan and made an alternative offer of 0.5 percent.When negotiations went sour, Yang ended his Bitmain contract in June 2016 and launched Bitewei one month later.Beyond Yang himself, Bitewei attracted several other bitcoin industry veterans. The startup’s list of early investors included notable figures in the Chinese bitcoin mining community, such as co-founders of the F2POOL Wang Chun and Mao Shixing, as well as Wu Ying, chairman of an investment firm called China Capital Group. Based on a Chinese business registration database, both Mao and Wang are now Bitewei board members. Bitewei’s rivalry with Bitmain intensified during the past two years as they battled over the intellectual property Yang designed.Last year, Yang told CoinDesk Bitmain filed a patent infringement lawsuit against him over Bitewei’s adoption of the so-called “serial power circuit design” for Whatsminer – a technology that Bitmain secured a patent for in March 2016.  In retaliation, Yang filed a claim to revoke Bitmain’s patent on the grounds that serial power supply circuit designs were widely used and documented. China’s State Intellectual Property Office (SIPO) invalidated Bitmain’s patent on April 8. The SIPO’s statement about revoking Bitmain’s authorized patent, for lack of unique creativity in the Antminer’s design, said:“If a technological solution sought by a patent has different characteristics than existing technologies, but such difference is public knowledge, then it is obvious the solution would incorporate this public knowledge.”The Urumqi Intermediate Court in China’s Xinjiang province, where the legal complaint was initially filed by Bitmain, then followed the SIPO’s lead and dismissed the case on August 31, according to a court document Yang shared with CoinDesk. Bitmain declined to comment.By this point, Xiong noted that the animosity between these manufacturing teams was common knowledge in bitcoin mining circles. But the controversy surrounded Bitmain has gone far beyond this patent fight and its ongoing hardware and mining pool dominance.Bitmain co-founder Jihan Wu has long been an outspoken supporter of the cryptocurrency bitcoin cash, created by a disagreement over the technical direction of the bitcoin software, a fact which has made him a persona non grata among bitcoin’s developers.Yet as argued by the research firm Alliance Bernstein, Bitmain’s strong belief in bitcoin cash may have caused it an issue of declining cash flow, and may put it in a further position to be challenged by a competitor. Analysts wrote in a recent report that Bitmain now holds about 5.7 percent of the total supply of bitcoin cash, which they said was “likely” purchased using its operating cash and bitcoin holdings.“These BCH holdings, valued at $890 million as of [Q1 2018], pose another major risk as BCH is illiquid and has depreciated nearly 20 percent since [Q1 2018],” the report noted at the time.Bitmain’s controversy could turn out to be a boon for Bitewei, which has avoided entanglements with blockchain industry rumors and conflicts. If Wu and Bitmain are bitcoin cash believers in their core, then Yang is simply the chip guy.“Full-custom methodology can be applied to literally every type of chip,” Yang said of his vision for Bitewei, which is to become the greatest chip maker, hinting in the long-term, the firm is not limited to just making crypto miners.He concluded:“Our miners’ market share may go above 50 percent. But our own hashing power will never go above 50 percent, in fact, 10 percent will be already good enough.”Bitcoin mining via Shutterstock"

With a single bitcoin valued at $8,935 at the time, the company is claiming that it is owed more than $5.5 million in damages.Bitmain claims that the thief used the bitcoin in its Binance wallet to buy MANA – a crypto asset used as part of the Decentraland project – “at a price that was far above the going market rate.”The thief also allegedly created a purchase order for ether using Bitmain’s BTC wallet, before making another purchase order for MANA using Bitmain’s ETH.At the same time, the attacker created a sell order with their existing MANA wallet, allowing them to trade Bitmain’s BTC for their MANA “at a correspondingly inflated price,” adding:“Upon information and belief, Binance’s automated system matched the deflated MANA sell order with the deflated MANA purchase order and executed the trade and John Doe obtained significant gains—at the expense of Bitmain. As a result, John Doe benefitted twice from transferring MANA into and out of Bitmain’s digital wallet.”The complaint filing in Seattle, Washington, has to do with the fact that the alleged thief is said to have utilized an account they held with crypto exchange Bittrex. The lawsuit alleges that the MANA the thief used in the transaction was originally stored in a Bittrex wallet, and Bittrex is based out of Washington.Moreover, “after John Doe had completed his/her theft of BTC from Bitmain, he/she transferred that BTC out of the John Doe’s Binance wallet and ultimately into a digital wallet on the Bittrex cryptocurrency trading platform.”The lawsuit is therefore claiming that the Washington court has jurisdiction over the matter based on the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, the Washington Cybercrime Act and other computer fraud laws.The court may also have jurisdiction depending on the thief’s identity, the filing stated.While Binance and Bittrex are named in the suit as the institutions providing accounts for Bitmain and the John Doe, neither are parties to the suit, meaning they are not being sued and are not suing.An attorney for Bitmain declined to comment when reached.Justice scales image via Shutterstock"

Gox creditors filed a petition to the bankruptcy court in Tokyo in an effort to move Mt. Gox out of the bankruptcy case – which started since its infamous hack in 2014 – into civil rehabilitation. The court subsequently approved the petition in June.Currently, Mt. Gox creditors are also drafting refund policies via their legal representatives, seeking to receive their bitcoin assets in the original form of the deposit – instead of cash– via a designated cryptocurrency exchange.Mt. Gox, at its peak the largest bitcoin exchange by trading volume, declared bankruptcy in 2014 following the theft of 744,000 BTC from the platform. Creditors subsequently began a years-long process in a bid to retrieve their funds still held by the exchange.Mt. Gox logo image via Shutterstock"

Poloniex will also support trading markets for both tokens after the hard fork.”In the message, the exchange stressed its intention to remain neutral during the split in order to allow the community to decide which blockchain it will support, demonstrated through advanced trading activity. It also stated that it would be evaluating each hard fork individually to decide whether to support the fork or continue pre-fork trading.Pre-fork trading has been made available for USDC/BCHSV and USDC/BCHABC as well as bitcoin trading pairs.Customers will also be able to convert their BCH into an equivalent amount of BCHABC and BCHSV and vice versa if they wish to withdraw funds, but they will not be able to withdraw BCHABC and BCHSV ahead of the fork.The exchange plans to continue supporting trading for both bitcoin cash ABC and SV after the planned fork on Nov. 15.Overall, the news comes during what has been a slower trading day for the crypto asset, one that has surged of late on the news traders may be able to receive additional tokens through the creation of a competing blockchain, should the blockchain’s users continue to support both versions of the technology.At press time, the price of bitcoin cash is down 0.81 percent on the day.Tram Tracks via Shutterstock"

But the W3C had trouble at first getting bitcoin developers and other cryptocurrency enthusiasts involved in the work.However, with the help of only a few developers, cryptocurrency is looking compatible with the API. And, further than that, lightning is already compatible with the specification.“All in all, we should be able to get bitcoin and lightning working with the [specification] without any major roadblocks,” prominent lightning developer Christian Decker told other developers in an email in August. In fact, Decker, an engineer at Blockstream, specifically joined the Web Payments Working Group to make sure bitcoin and lightning would not be missed.Such a step would put lightning on a similar footing as more established online payment methods, Decker told CoinDesk, adding:“This is exciting because switching between traditional payments and bitcoins and lightning payments could basically be a single click and make it easier for merchants to accept bitcoin alongside these traditional methods.”Plus, there are other advantages to getting lightning into the specification.Whenever a user enters their payment information, whether that’s their credit card number and expiration date or their lightning information, the API saves that information to the browser for easy payment the next time.Still, there is work to be done to make this happen.For one, Decker said that a so-called “payment method ID” must be assigned to bitcoin and lightning before it can be a functioning part of the API.“Currently only the basic-card identifier has been assigned, but we can apply for one eventually,” he said.Decker seems in no rush. According to him, lightning developers are taking a passive approach, watching developments within the Web Payments Working Group “very closely” to ensure that lightning remains compatible.“By being part of the working group we are in a position to raise objections should an incompatibility emerge and we [can] propose alternatives or improvements that better reflect the constraints that come from bitcoin and lightning being very unique payment systems,” Decker told CoinDesk.It’s important to emphasize, though, that members don’t have to do anything as a part of the working group – it’s all rather voluntary.And not everyone in the working group will necessarily have “crypto” top of mind. For instance, a bunch of companies contribute loosely to the W3C payment specifications, including the likes of Airbnb, Apple, Google, Facebook and Visa, companies that might be looking to push adoption of other, more obviously beneficial for their businesses, payment methods.Decker is the sole lightning representative in the group of 172 participants.As such, even though lightning is compatible, it’s still up to the browsers and merchants to actually add lightning support.Still, Ian Jacobs, the W3C payments activity head, argued these types of payments will be an option, telling CoinDesk:“The architecture is designed to enable new payment methods to be used on the web. That should include blockchain-based payment methods.”Turning the W3C standards into code is another key step for pushing lightning into the browser.Some browsers, including Chrome, Microsoft Edge (formerly Internet Explorer), Samsung browser and Safari have already put the API into practice, while Firefox uses it in “beta,” meaning it’s not quite stable yet.But so far, none have adopted the cryptocurrency or lightning part of the specifications.That’s likely partly because the specifications are still in progress. Not to mention, a developer needs to build the actual code implementation for the lightning payments, Decker said.“I’m not aware of any real implementation, but that would be a very welcome development, and I’d be more than happy to support it,” he told CoinDesk.One concern, though, is that lightning is so new and experimental, users have been known to lose money when sending a payment across the network. In other words, lightning still has a ways to go to even be safe to use – let alone easy. Bitcoin developer Sjors Provoost, who’s been thinking about how lightning in a browser might look, raised this concern in a comment on the project’s GitHub.“Bitcoin and lightning wallets are much more involved than just storing a credit card number in a browser,” Provoost contended.Yet Decker argued:“I’d say that using bitcoin or lightning payments are probably safer than credit cards.”Browsers image via Shutterstock"

Bitcoin is the awakened sleeping giant of it all because it has fundamentally and forever changed money and, more importantly, money’s seat of power.For me, this is the most important aspect of bitcoin and cryptocurrency: its role in propagating power to the greatest number of people possible. What Satoshi did when he democratized money was hand every individual alive – and generations to come – vast personal liberty.This shift in power from the few to the many equals events in history like the advent of democracy itself, the invention of the printing press and the Renaissance. But it’s important to remember that nothing is free. What we gained in liberty with bitcoin, we lost in the security of knowing someone else was responsible for protecting our money.But which would you rather have? Would you rather be able to spend your money exactly how you see fit and know that it is safe from the whims of political leaders with no skin in the game? Or would you rather have the comfort of knowing that if you fail to be vigilant, someone will make you financially whole again?This is why I’m an ardent student of history. It’s a shortcut to understanding human nature, and it tells me I’d rather take my chances being the one making decisions about my life.These days you don’t even need to study the past. The 24-hour news cycle gives us a window on economic disaster as it unfolds. We’re seeing in real time every stage of financial collapse on a national scale.Look to Venezuela to see a society in the last throes of a financial meltdown, its people starving while its leaders continue to thrive, inflation hitting numbers that seem made up.The International Monetary Fund expects that Venezuela’s year-end annual inflation rate will approach 13,000 percent. That’s astonishing when you consider that 4 or 5 percent makes news in other parts of the world. We’ve all heard about post World War I Germany and people using bags of money to buy bread. Here we are, a century later, and people are still subject to the capriciousness of the powerful.Bitcoin could have changed things for the Venezuelans if they’d had an inkling of what was to come – and they should have – and thought to buy bitcoin or some other currency not tied to the bolivar.Look to Turkey to see the early stages of a financial meltdown. The country is battling rising government debt, double-digit inflation and a currency whose value has plummeted. Turkish citizens are frantically unloading their lira to hang onto whatever value they can.Many are turning to foreign currencies and many to bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.According to a survey of 15,000 people by Statistica, roughly one in five Turks owns cryptocurrency, the greatest rate of adoption of any of the countries surveyed. Bitcoin is already changing things for the Turks.To see a society in the earliest stages of this kind of collapse, look to the U.S. Few here realize where we are headed with our inflationary monetary policy and runaway spending. But those few are already hedging against what many experts say will be a new and massive financial crisis for this country.For the few paying attention, bitcoin is changing things in the U.S. before they even get started.We all know from trading cards and small toys in the schoolyard that money is part of being human. If it doesn’t already exist for us, we create it. I saw that in prison.Despite rules and razor wire, prisoners were able to create a currency of mackerel packets and a black market economy that was stunningly diverse in what it offered for sale – everything from personal services like weight training and letter writing to specialty catering built on the limited, shelf-stable foods available.So in a sense, bitcoin is nothing new to money. People are always innovating, and bitcoin is the logical next step. It is the response of people long imprisoned by a system that puts them at a significant disadvantage compared to the powerful. It’s a system that has allowed those who rule money to steal from the people who use and save it for themselves and their families.Again, you don’t need a history book to see what happens when governments are sloppy and even malicious with monetary policy, when leaders neglect their duty to protect not only a country’s currency but also its value. All we need to know from history is that this has happened many more times than once and that it will happen again – is happening now.Our dependence on others to take care of us at the expense of personal liberty and responsibility has grown insidiously to the point when people are at the mercy of individuals and organizations who have never had their best interests at heart.Bitcoin comes with great rewards and risk, but your national currency is fiat with everything that entails and has its own even graver risks, I believe. To me, it is handing someone else the keys to the future and crossing your fingers.Any history book will tell you how well that’s worked out.Liberty Bell image via Shutterstock"

blockchain-powered video game aimed at mainstream audiences.","Nov 16, 2018 at 14:00 UTC",One of the bitcoin community’s best-known artists is gearing up to launch a blockchain-powered video game aimed at mainstream audiences.,"Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, Marguerite deCourcelle’s startup Blockade Games Inc. raised a $833,000 seed equity round the first week of November from investors including BlockTower Capital Partners and Horizon Digital, to put towards its flagship game, “Neon District.”With the raise, Blockade Games has garnered a $13 million valuation.Ari Paul, managing partner at BlockTower Capital, told CoinDesk that deCourcelle’s long-standing reputation first attracted him to the startup.DeCourcelle is known for fine art puzzles revealing the public and private keys – the alphanumeric strings that act as passwords for crypto assets – to bitcoin stashes worth more than $1 million total. But on top of that, the team includes artists and designers that worked on games like Spider-Man for the PlayStation 4 and the World of Warcraft trading card game,“There are tremendous economic incentives for game developers to integrate cryptocurrency and for game players to want them to,” Paul said, adding that new crypto assets dubbed non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, can also strengthen network effects across gaming communities.“I think we’ll see a rapid move towards this because we’ll see the economics are so beneficial in a straightforward way,” he added.Although deCourcelle didn’t commit to cryptocurrencies being hidden throughout the new game, she did say, it might very well include some of her trademark puzzles with bitcoin rewards donated by the Pineapple Fund.And with an advisor like “Age of Rust” creator Chris Loverme, who made one of the world’s first games with bitcoin rewards, winning the original cryptocurrency is looking more and more likely within the new game.According to deCourcelle, Loverme is helping create bridges between external games and Neon District, a cypherpunk roleplaying game, which will launch publically in May 2019.“For example, you could have an end-game experience in Neon District as a 2D game, then wake up in an Age of Rust storyline with your asset, and they can maintain some of the qualities they had beyond that trip,” deCourcelle told CoinDesk.She continued:“We’re really focusing on the utility of these game assets. So you have your core [storyline] loop, and then we already have designed multiple side loops that compliment and feedback into the larger ecosystem of the main game.”The design is also an important part of the game – it progresses the concept popularized by the virtual pets collectibles Crypto Kitties by allowing blockchain-based characters to accrue scars, skills, weaponry and other unique distinctions while enhancing storylines and squad-based gameplay.In addition to the characters themselves, the game will include puzzles that reveal NFT rewards like tools or weapons.So far, there are already 8,000 people signed up for the Blockade Games’ mailing list.While many of those people are perhaps crypto enthusiasts, the game is architected so that even those not familiar with cryptocurrency can play – and get their first experience with crypto.“Let’s say I’m playing the game, and I don’t even know it’s crypto related, and I earn some item or reward,” Paul told CoinDesk. “I’m then informed by a little drop down box that I don’t have to do anything. But if I want to, I can claim ownership of this item outside of the game or I can transfer it to another game.”Since utilizing the ethereum-based assets beyond the game will be optional, deCourcelle’s team is doing extensive research this winter through a holiday-themed mobile game called “Buidl Bear.” This digital version of Build-A-Bear workshops where people design their own stuffed animals was launched to better understand how gamers manage keys and interact with smart contracts.Speaking to the artistic potential such blockchain-based gaming assets could open up for developers, deCourcelle said:“I think there’s going to be a big creative explosion in this area. So we’re building this community that is very supportive.”Image courtesy of Blockade Games"

Later, in September 2012, they gave him $250,000 for the same purpose, the lawsuit alleges, but later realized that Shrem had not given them the full value of the amount in bitcoin.They now claiming to be short by roughly 5,000 bitcoin, worth almost $32 million at today’s prices. At the time of the deal in 2012, one bitcoin was worth approximately $12.50.The Winklevoss brothers claim they appealed to Shrem for the cryptocurrency they say they were due, but that it was not forthcoming. Specifically, the lawsuit claims that extravagant purchases Shrem has made since leaving jail two years ago – despite having previously said he had almost no money at the time of serving the sentence – including two Maserati sports cars, two powerboats and a $2 million property in Florida, are likely being funded by the alleged misappropriated cryptocurrency.“Either Shrem has been incredibly lucky and successful since leaving prison, or – more likely – he ‘acquired’ his six properties, two Maseratis, two powerboats and other holdings with the appreciated value of the 5,000 Bitcoin he stole …” the lawsuit states, according to the NYT.Shrem has now had some assets frozen by the judge presiding in his previous trial, according to the court documents.In a statement reported in the NYT, Shrem’s lawyer, Brian Klein, said:“The lawsuit erroneously alleges that about six years ago Charlie essentially misappropriated thousands of Bitcoins. Nothing could be further from the truth. Charlie plans to vigorously defend himself and quickly clear his name.”Shrem started his ordered two year prison term in March 2015, though ultimately only served one year.The CEO of now-defunct bitcoin exchange BitInstant, Shrem had previously been found to have violated anti-money laundering rules by dealing with a customer who supplied $1 million in bitcoin to people buying drugs on the online marketplace Silk Road.Shrem entered a plea bargain in court, agreeing to forfeit $950,000 to the U.S. government as a condition of compliance with the deal.The latter agreement may come back to haunt Shrem, according to the NYT, which says that an affidavit filed in court indicates that Shrem did not pay the $950,000 to the government.Charlie Shrem image via CoinDesk archives"

But, more interesting to me, is the usefulness of bitcoin. The ability of transfer values without a trust in the system is hugely disruptive,” he said.Last year, the Wall Street Journal reported that Cumberland had traded more than $20 billion worth of bitcoin, ether and other crypto assets since 2016.Wilson added that custody solution could be one key obstacle at the moment to a wider institution adoption of crypto trading as he sees that as a crucial stepping stone. Elsewhere in the fireside chat, Wilson also commented on yesterday’s report by the New York Office of the Attorney General, one which saw the regulator releasing findings indicating several crypto exchange may be involved in market manipulation and the violation of state laws.While agreeing to most of the arguments made by the regulator, Wilson sees “one of the biggest problems in this industry is the lack of clarity from regulators on what the rules are,” concluding:“Such uncertainty could drive away innovative projects in the space to other jurisdictions with clearer guidelines such as Switzerland and Singapore.”Cumberland image via Consensus Singapore"

As technology advances, financial transactions involving cryptocurrency have become more common. For some enterprises, it may be desirable to aggregate cryptocurrency deposited by customers in an enterprise account.”To that end, the bank’s system includes a processor and memory to store a private key associated with some cryptocurrency holdings. The patent goes on to describe how this system would be able to both store the holdings, as well as facilitate transactions when authorized.This sort of system brings a number of benefits in terms of using less bandwidth and memory, as well as requiring fewer computational and power resources, according to the document.To allow customers to conduct transactions with their funds, the system would grant the customer access to their specific account. They would then be able to execute a transaction with their cryptocurrency directly through the account.The patent award is the latest to emerge for Bank of America in recent days. In a patent award issued late last month, Bank of America hinted at a means for storing cryptographic keys – including those tied to crypto assets – on a hardware device.BoA image via Shutterstock"

It is worth noting that BTC is trading below all three major moving averages – 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day EMA – which could be considered a bearish sign.However, these averages are flatlined, which indicates that BTC has lacked a clear directional bias for far too long. As a result, a big move in either direction is overdue.Over on the 4-hour chart, BTC is trading just below the lower edge of the ascending triangle, meaning the bull failure at the 50-day EMA is beginning to prove costly.Furthermore, the relative strength index (RSI) has fallen back below 50.00 in bearish territory.A downside break would be confirmed if the current or the next 4-hour candle closes below the triangle support. In that case, BTC could fall quickly to $6,328 (Sept. 28 low).Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.Bitcoin image via Shutterstock; Charts by Trading View"

Fear of the unknown, fear of change. In these times, we need to be vigilant about how we examine what’s new or different.Hundreds of articles have been written about campaign contributions made with cryptocurrencies — and all too often they get it wrong. Many of these articles are riddled with factual errors, but more distressingly engender fear of something new based on a deep misunderstanding.I know because, during my recent run for Congress, approximately $300,000 of my campaign contributions were donated in cryptocurrency.I wasn’t a fringe candidate who rails against the government. I was a Senior Tech Advisor in President Obama’s White House who wrote the White House memo on Bitcoin and briefed the president on the technology.After leaving the White House, I started the research lab on cryptocurrencies at MIT to help the world better understand this emerging technology and its global impact – and that’s what I seek to do in this article.Here are some of the biggest misconceptions:While bitcoin was invented more than 10 years ago, there are still far too many misconceptions about the technology. The misconceptions lead to fear and fear leads to hysteria. It’s more important than ever that public officials are guided by facts and not hysteria.For one, our elected representatives will be asked to regulate this new technology. Second, this technology is being developed for even greater participation.In 2016, nearly 300,000 overseas voters who requested ballots were not able to return them to their county clerks. I wasn’t surprised by this number. I lived abroad while serving in the Peace Corps and sent in my ballots only for them to be infrequently counted during my time in Nicaragua.Bradley Tusk, a supporter of my campaign, is working with officials in West Virginia to address this by enabling our Americans serving abroad to vote with a mobile application built with the technology powering cryptocurrencies, blockchain.

much-anticipated talk at Scaling Bitcoin Friday, where the Blockstream ...","Oct 6, 2018 at 03:07 UTC","Some dub it a “breakthrough,” others call it a “network attack.”","Those were the prevailing opinions leading up to Mark Friedenbach’s much-anticipated talk at Scaling Bitcoin Friday, where the Blockstream co-founder presented for the first time “Forward Blocks,” a proposal that claims to make future, contentious changes to bitcoin – such as block size increase or proof-of-work change – easier to do.It’s a big announcement, one that was shrouded in secrecy in the weeks leading up to the event as it challenges core perceptions that are widely held within bitcoin’s community. Chief among them is the assertion that massive changes can be made to bitcoin in a backwards-compatible way, without asking every user to upgrade their software.One issue – that many bitcoin users use the protocol to achieve a kind of sovereignty over their money, and that mandatory software changes essentially undermine that control – has long loomed over protocol changes, surfacing as a major point of contention that ultimately led to the network’s infamous bitcoin cash fork.In this way, Friedenbach’s research addresses an issue cryptocurrency developers have been grappling with for ages: how, exactly, should bigger changes be made to a massive distributed system? Many would argue that more drastic bitcoin changes are, and should be, difficult, contending that as bitcoin is decentralized, and has no “king,” users should be able to choose to adopt or reject changes.Further, it was thought that some of the biggest changes to bitcoin could only be made with a “hard fork,” a change that isn’t backwards-compatible, requiring all the cryptocurrency’s users to upgrade to keep up with the change. Or, as Friedenbach argues, such was the case before “forward blocks.”“Most of the scaling debate is wrapped up in the issue of how to do a hard fork safely, and when, if ever, we should do a hard fork for scaling purposes,” Friedenbach told CoinDesk. However, with his new work, he’s arguing this isn’t a problem anymore.He said:“‘Forward blocks makes that whole argument pointless. We don’t need a hard-fork to scale bitcoin, if and when we decide to do so. It can be accomplished as a soft fork, like SegWit was.”Here, Friedenbach is arguing that opt-in changes to the bitcoin network, such as the one used in bitcoin’s upgrade last year, could be used even for larger changes.A developer working in the background, Friedenbach’s not particularly well-known in cryptocurrency circles.He left a job developing space research apps at NASA to work on bitcoin full-time, going on to work on the theory behind some possibly huge future changes to bitcoin, like boosting its smart contracts functionality so that users can make more complex types of transactions and co-authoring the original Blockstream paper on sidechains.With all this under his belt, perhaps it’s not surprising he took an interest in how to make changes to the cryptocurrency.Actually, it wasn’t bitcoin’s block size, but a different code change entirely that prompted Friedenbach to look into the idea: Changing bitcoin’s proof-of-work algorithm, commonly seen as a check against those securing the network with powerful computing hardware (miners) from racking up too much power.As ASICs have creeped onto a number of blockchains that have sought to resist them over the past year, many have been advocating for a formal change to be made to bitcoin. For example, in the Sia community, users recently decided after months of debate that they will enact the “kill switch” hard fork to kick out the current ASICs in power.Developers have generally thought a hard fork was the only way to make this change, making it a particularly contentious proposition. But as it turns out, Forward Blocks are helpful here as well, making it possible to execute a consensus change with a soft fork rather than a hard fork.So, how do forward blocks work? In his new paper, Friedenbach describes the change as a sort of mash-up of a variety of types of forks.“While each of these approaches individually have unacceptable trade-offs, it turns out, remarkably, that combining them all together ‘cancels out’ most of the bad tradeoffs while retaining the combined benefits,” the paper explains.“The resulting scheme, held together by a novel new mechanism we call forward blocks, is actually less complicated than one might think of a ‘everything and the kitchen sink’ proposal,” the paper goes on.Since it’s such a general upgrade – a way to make changes, it’s worth noting the two upgrades Friedenbach emphasizes – block sizes and proof-of-work – aren’t the only possible applications. Friedenbach even argues the method of change could be used for “sharding” bitcoin to scale the protocol further, a term that evokes a technique being pursued on ethereum.(The paper describes all these ideas as well as how forward blocks are accomplished in greater detail).Still, while the paper wasn’t presented in full until today, there’s been some chatter on social media ahead of the talk. Some bitcoin developers are much less excited by the idea.“It’s a network attack being called an upgrade,” pseudonymous bitcoin enthusiast “Shinobimonkey” told CoinDesk. (In fact, he has harsh words for the Scaling Bitcoin conference where the paper was proposed in general. “This event needs to be eviscerated, ridiculed and drown in the bathtub,” he tweeted.)Blockstream CEO Adam Back similarly painted it as interesting upgrade, but maybe not such a big deal.“I think it’s OK. Discovering mechanisms can be useful and separate from whether it would be practical technically and in terms of user consensus. It’s just another tool to know about,” he told CoinDesk.But the proposal has also attracted eager supporters. Bitcoin Core contributor Karl-Johan Alm went as far as to call it a “breakthrough,” while still arguing it’s unclear whether it will be used in practice just yet.“Regardless of what the outcome is, options are opening up to do things we didn’t think could be done previously. Whether we do them is a completely separate story,” Alm continued.Friedenbach isn’t necessarily advocating for it to be used on bitcoin either. Rather, he’s just trying to point out that the option exists, opening a wider discussion.“Tools aren’t moral objects, they don’t have ‘good’ or ‘bad’ moral weight. They just are. How you use a tool is the question, and with respect to bitcoin this is not something that I have an opinion on,” Friedenbach told CoinDesk.Time will tell if the bitcoin community finds it’s worth a try.In the meantime, Friedenbach is planning to test the change on “Freicoin,” a cryptocurrency project he co-launched years ago with a slightly different economic model than bitcoin. And, if the small community Freicoin decides to adopt it, the method of upgrading will be tested in the wild for the first time there.Correction: Due to an editing error, an earlier version of this article called Shinobimonkey a bitcoin developer. This has now been corrected.Mark Friedenbach presentation at Scaling Bitcoin image via CoinDesk

Notably, while Bitmain is only just now enabling these mining devices to use AsicBoost, the chips were already capable of supporting the function on a hardware level.In particular, the post claims that this will ensure Bitmain’s machines remain effective at mining the number one cryptocurrency by market capitalization, while simultaneously increasing the hashrate of the bitcoin network and reducing its energy footprint.The company explained that it previously had not intended to release software supporting the AsicBoost method due to concerns that the software may be protected by patents. However, the company’s legal counsel had decided that there presently is no specific patent claim over the software.According to the announcement:“Now we are pleased to give Antminer users whose miners have the capability to support this function a choice to avail this advantage without any negative impact on the Bitcoin protocol. This variant of the ‘overt AsicBoost’ simply uses version bits different from those that other manufacturers have been using. It is equally transparent because it can be seen in the blockheader of boosted blocks.”Bitmain added that it also intends to release firmware supporting the same functionality for its Antminer R4, S9i, S9j, T9 and T9+ miners next week.AsicBoost has seen some controversy in the past, with Bitcoin Core developers claiming that miners using the method – which exploits a flaw in bitcoin’s proof-of-work algorithm to mine bitcoin a 20 percent hike in efficiency –were engaging in unfair practices that could harm the network.While Bitmain was accused of covertly using AsicBoost in April 2017, the company denied using it in any production capacity.Bitmain’s software release comes days after software startup Braiins announced it would publish open-source code to enable AsicBoost on the Antminer S9 on its own.In a blog post last Thursday, the startup said it had independently verified that the miner was capable of supporting AsicBoost, though it said adding the code would save about 13 percent of energy costs, rather than the 20 percent claimed last year.In today’s announcement, Bitmain noted that its btc.com and Antpool bitcoin mining pools both implemented AsicBoost from March 2018.Bitcoin mining image via Shutterstock"

The committee didn’t reach a conclusion at the time, needing a longer period to fully understand the issue.While some commissioners at the hearing argued against an outright ban, others raised the question of how to verify the origin of a virtual currency donation.With the decision now made, an FPPC representative told CoinDesk on Friday that there will still be further debate and analysis on the issue in the coming period, stating:“There was extensive research by staff, input from stakeholders that was publicly displayed on our website and public debate among the Commission today and that is the decision rendered. As was publicly stated by many if not all of the Commissioners, there will be further debate and analysis in the coming months and years.”Currently, the U.S. Federal Election Commission allows candidates to accept cryptocurrencies like bitcoin as an in-kind donation, a ruling that was made back in 2014.On a state level, some, such as South Carolina, have taken a similar stance as California and prohibited bitcoin donations outright.

As a so-called stablecoin, TrueUSD is designed to maintain parity with the U.S. dollar.For customers outside Bangalore, support for stablecoins may provide an indirect way to add or hold value in their Unocoin accounts without quite as much volatility, albeit it falls short of a fiat on-ramp. However, that transaction volume is still less than a few thousand TUSD per day.“We never even considered that [stablecoins] before,” Ray said. “That’s more just like a stop-gap solution. It’s not like an actual, final solution to everything.”As Unocoin investigates how to scale compliant ATMs, Ray said the team is also looking to expand to Malta and Canada, in case operating in India becomes impossible altogether, all while exploring the options for listing several new stablecoins.Stepping back, an ongoing legal battle to overturn or alter this ban hasn’t yielded any results to date. Meanwhile, the ban is having a disastrous impact on India’s crypto community, with the popular exchange startup Zebpay abruptly shutting down late last month.As Kashif Raza, a co-founder of Crypto Kanoon, an Indian regulatory news startup, told CoinDesk:“The crypto community is suffering from this ban as there have been instances where the bank accounts of individuals have been closed who were found to be dealing in cryptocurrencies.”The crackdown has been so severe that Raza said it has created a misconception in India that bitcoin itself is outlawed, even though the ban only applies to entities governed by RBI.“From a regulatory perspective there hasn’t been any real clarity,” Ray said. “We as a company are working on a couple of solutions.”None of this should imply that Indian crypto startups are now operating in a black market. To the contrary, Raza said exchange accounts can sometimes require more know-your-customer (KYC) paperwork than opening a new Indian bank account. Many see the ban as an inconvenient pause, not a death knell.“Given the fact that the Indian government seems to be in favor of the technology behind virtual currencies, the crypto community is quite hopeful that [banking crypto companies] will be regulated in future,” Raza said.Plus, Unocoin’s ATMs allow for regulation-conscious investors like Karthik Reddy of Blume Ventures, who praised the new ATMs in a press statement, to keep detailed records of their crypto portfolios while still depositing fiat currency as needed.On the other hand, the ban has certainly invigorated peer-to-peer trading. Indeed, the P2P exchange WazirX reached a new daily trading volume peak of 50 BTC in September 2018. At the same time, the global P2P exchange LocalBitcoins reached nearly $1.5 million in weekly Indian trading volume at least three times since August.And there’s even silver lining for Unocoin, which has seen up to 500 new account registrations every day ever since Zebpay closed its doors.“It’s almost kind of freeing in a way because there are a lot of people in India that don’t have online banking,” Ray said. “Almost everybody in India uses cash, so it might in an odd way open us up to an even bigger market.”Still, speaking to how restricting crypto companies that seek to serve a country of 1.3 billion could affect global adoption, Ray concluded:“Innovation is being squashed in a country where one in seven people live.”Unocoin’s Bangalore ATM image via Unocoin."

LightningPeach, the team behind the new vending machine, added a device capable of joining the network to a coffee machine that already sported some built-in smart components.The device is composed of a small Raspberry Pi computer and a unique circuit board designed by the team to process transactions.Vasyl Grygorovych, LightningPeach’s head of community, told CoinDesk that the team’s strategic goal is to develop a real-world infrastructure for faster bitcoin payments.“With a small computer and a chip, which is assembled by us or is easy to reproduce … it is much easier to pay with cryptocurrencies than with credit cards, because you don’t need your credit cards at all, you just need your mobile device,” he said.The team’s head, Pavel Prikhodko, explained that the chip can be installed on other types of devices as well.He continued:“In a way, as we connect this machine, we can connect lots of other stuff, both offline and online. It relies on the infrastructure we built, so we really want for this to open the road to other businesses who want to try crypto. We want to [build] a way to do this easily.”Users can scan a QR code on the machine using their phones, which connects to a bitcoin  wallet, the release explains. They would then be charged $2 for a cup of coffee, which the system would then convert into roughly 15,800 satoshis (smallest subdivision of a bitcoin).Grygorovych said the team modified a commercially available coffee maker, which already had the ability to connect to the internet, making accessing the Lightning Network relatively easy.“We just need to put this hardware inside,” Prikhodko said.Moreover, Prikhodko explained, “Cheaper [chips] can be installed into a majority of vending machines, so you can use them whenever you want … like universities or malls. And people [who] have bitcoin wallets with Lightning support can just pay with no issues.”While the first coffee machine LightningPeach has modified remains operational inside Bitfury’s office, there are no plans to distribute a mass-production version at this time. Rather, the device was built to determine whether Lightning-compatible vending machines were feasible at all.“We’re still thinking if we should scale this or just keep this … but overall we work with lots of companies around the world in understanding use cases and understanding what needs to be created, how real businesses … [might] use Lightning. That’s just one example,” Grygorovych said.LightningPeach coffee machine image courtesy Rachel Pipan/Bitfury"

Upon discovering Kim’s theft in November of that year, the firm immediately fired him.But Kim didn’t stop there. He then started soliciting funds from individual customers, apparently to continue trading in crypto with the hope of making profits to repay his ex-employer. As a result, he fraudulently obtained approximately $545,000 from at least five customers between December and March 2018.Kim reportedly lied to customers that he had voluntarily left his employer to start his own trading company. He also falsley claimed he would invest funds in a low-risk arbitrage strategy, when in fact, he made high-risk trades with the cryptocurrency and lost all $545,000 of his customers’ funds.In addition to a fine of $1,146,000, the CFTC has also permanently banned Kim from trading, including in cryptocurrencies, and sentenced him to 15 months in jail, according to the release.James McDonald, director of enforcement at the CFTC, said:“Today’s Order stands as yet another in the string of cases showing the CFTC’s commitment to actively police the virtual currency markets and protect the public interest.Bitcoin and gavel image via Shutterstock"

The report is dated October 31.Perhaps most notably, the report emphasized its writers’ view of the market’s “rapidly morphing thesis,” which began by defining bitcoin as “digital cash” and noting that investors had full confidence in it, to a solution for issues in the financial system, to a new payment system to ultimately a new institutional investment class.Various issues and discoveries around the bitcoin ecosystem have caused the thesis to evolve, including the permanent ledger recording all transactions, a number of hacks, hard forks, new technologies which are cheaper than bitcoin, market volatility and other concerns, the report explains.As such, the market’s current thesis appears to be that bitcoin is a “new institutional investment class,” and has been for almost a year, the authors wrote. The amount of crypto assets under management has been increasing since January 2016, with $7.11 billion currently being stored by hedge funds, venture capital firms and private equity firms.The fact that major financial institutions are increasingly getting involved supports this thesis, the report continued, citing Fidelity’s new crypto services division, investments in Seed CX, BitGo and Binance, regulatory approvals and Coinbase’s recent fundraising round.That being said, the report did cite three issues clients had with investing in the cryptocurrency space: regulatory uncertainty, a lack of regulated custodian solutions and a current lack of large financial institutions in the space.The report also delved into a popular topic as of late: stablecoins, or types of cryptocurrencies that seek to enable some form of price stability.Bitcoin is “moving increasingly towards trading vs the stable coin USD-Tether (USDT) [sic],” the report states, referring to the controversial, dollar-linked token operated by Tether. Half of all current bitcoin trading is now against another digital asset, continuing a trend which began last year.The fact that many crypto exchanges do not accept fiat currencies contributed to this state of affairs, the report’s authors said.They went on to explain:“USDT took an increasing share of BTC trading volumes as cryptocurrency prices started falling. This occurred because many exchanges only trade crypto->crypto and not crypto->fiat. Trading crypto->fiat requires going through the banking sector which charges a higher fee. Also as bitcoin prices fell, so did most all other coins so if owners wanted to come out of bitcoin holdings, they needed to go to another asset which was closer to the valuation of the U.S. dollar.”Crypto startups are now hopping on the trend, with exchanges and other companies developing their own stablecoins as “part of the next wave of development.”That being said, the researchers do not see all stablecoins surviving: only those “with the lowest transaction costs, highest liquidity and defined regulatory structure” are likely to see increased adoption.Editor’s note: This article has been updated to clarify that report represents the Morgan Stanley research team’s view of the market’s evolving thesis on bitcoin and cryptos, not their own specific thesis.Morgan Stanley image via Ken Wolter / Shutterstock"

At this point, we are unable to find a reasonable way to conduct the cryptocurrency exchange business. As a result, we are stopping our exchange activities.”Zebpay stressed that its wallet service will continue to operate even after the exchange halts, saying:“Please note that the Zebpay wallet will continue to work even after the exchange stops. You are free to deposit and withdraw coins / tokens into your wallet.”Based on data from CoinMarketCap, trading volume on Zebpay has been heavily impacted by the Reserve Bank of India’s decision.Following the exchange’s announcement in July that it would pause Indian rupee deposits and withdrawals, 24-hour trading volume on the platform plunged from $5 million in early July to currently just a little over $200,000.As CoinDesk has reported previously, the Indian central bank issued the bank ban in April, after which crypto exchanges filed a petition to the country’s supreme court.Yet, the court said in July that the ban would remain active until it makes a final hearing – which is yet to be conducted after the case was postponed earlier in September.Zebpay had not responded to a CoinDesk request for comment by press time.Zebpay image via Shutterstock"

It’s a bit of closer-knit community in Iran.”Some vendors have even set up physical shops and conduct traditional KYC, just in case Iranian authorities ask about their activities.Stepping back, U.S. regulatory crackdowns against trading platforms such as EtherDelta have inspired some exchanges that serve American customers to start being more cautious about KYC requirements. And, according to SimilarWeb, roughly 13 percent of Binance’s website traffic comes from the U.S.“Regulators are starting to focus more on exchanges,” said attorney Nelson Rosario, who specializes in legal issues related to cryptocurrency at the Chicago-based firm Smolinski Rosario Law. Regarding Binance’s moves to de-risk, he added:“This is an example of how operating a business that deals with people all around the world can be extremely complex and it is nearly impossible to identify all the potential pitfalls in advance.”However, Rosario noted, Binance doesn’t have any operations in the U.S. and regulators have been paying the most attention to local companies.Binance is cutting ties with Iranian customers at a time when Iranian authorities are reportedly moving forward with plans for a national cryptocurrency akin to Venezuela’s petro.Mahmoud Eskandari, a Binance user and blockchain developer in Tehran, told CoinDesk he worries the government wants to “completely dominate the economic crisis” by controlling the crypto market.Such concerns are driving many Iranian crypto fans to establish small mining operations, rather than rely on external platforms.The narrowing range of exchange options has not dampened crypto fever among Iranians, however.Dehqan said the Binance news isn’t having a dramatic impact on Tehran’s bitcoin community because more Iranians mine cryptocurrency or hodl their assets, to hedge against inflation, than engage in speculative trading. He added:“The sanctions don’t have much effect on mining bitcoin. It’s actually profitable in Iran, compared to other countries.”Over the past year, Dehqan said Areatak has received inquiries for more than 1,000 colocation mining contracts, setting up the infrastructure and charging miners a percentage of their earnings, because electricity is so cheap.Dehqan estimated cryptocurrency mining in Iran requires a quarter of the electricity costs, less than a single cent per kilowatt hour, than mining in most industrialized countries.“Many people from other cities come to Tehran to buy mining devices,” said Eskandari, who also mines both bitcoin and ethereum. “My friend sells Antminers and mining devices in Tehran. He sold about 100 devices in the past month.”According to Iranian news reports, local regulators are also hammering out a legal system for tallying this burgeoning mining industry.“We have a lot of investors that have visited Iran since the World Mining Summit,” Dehqan said. “All and all, you can actually access buying cryptocurrency in Iran and that’s the only thing that matters.”Anna Baydakova contributed reporting.Iran image via Shutterstock"

while supports are labeled as “S1” and “S2,” with the pivot point ...","Oct 6, 2018 at 09:30 UTC",So you’ve pivoted to the upper echelons of your newfound expertise and are looking to increase your skill set to enable a greater understanding of the markets. ,"When combined with other technical tools, pivot points are valued among day traders for their ability to analyze price movement of an asset as well as defining the support and resistance levels during a short-term trading session.Pivot points were first developed by floor traders to predict support and resistance levels in the equity and commodities markets. They can also help to determine overall market trends, whereby if prices break upward past a certain area they can be considered bullish or, conversely, bearish if they pass below the same region.The most common way to calculate a pivot point is the “five-point system.” This comprises an average of the numerical high, low and close of the previous trading period to plot a course for five levels: two sets of supports, two sets of resistance levels and a “pivot point.”The five-point system is just one of a number of ways that was devised to calculate and identify support and resistance levels but it is also one of the simplest, the equation is as follows:Pivot Point (P) = (Previous High + Previous Low + Previous Close)/3Support 1 (S1) = (Pivot Point x 2) – Previous HighSupport 2 (S2) = Pivot Point – (Previous High – Previous Low)Resistance 1 (R1) = (Pivot Point x 2) – Previous LowResistance 2 (R2) = Pivot Point + (Previous High – Previous Low)The pivot point in the example above is derived from the previous low and previous close divided by 3, allowing traders to define an area on the chart where they believe price action is most sensitive and likely to cause a shift in sentiment should it close above or below that point.As seen from above, the equation is often tedious and time-consuming to complete by hand. However, if you use an online charting program this can be done automatically for you, plotting horizontal lines using the aforementioned formula with ease, just select the pivot point tool calibrated to the Fibonacci sequence.While there are traders out there who’ve adopted pivot points for longer time frames, common industry practice looks at the 4-hour and 1-hour charts, as well as the 30 and 15-minute time frames.When used in conjunction with other indicators such as the MACD and the relative strength index (RSI), traders can be more sure that the price action they are looking at is legitimate and significant.Take a look here at why we use Fibonacci theory to define support and resistance levels in our trading.In the bitcoin chart above the resistance levels are marked “R1” and “R2,” while supports are labeled as “S1” and “S2,” with the pivot point marked as “P.”Some traders use up to four resistance and support levels, but for now, let’s stick with the traditional two.The first example, dated Sept. 12, shows that pivot point, marked “P,” acted as a crucial threshold for prices to cross bullish for continuation, confirming to traders that the move past $6,285 was legitimate and that prices would move higher. The other indicators also confirmed the bullish move. For instance, the RSI showed oversold conditions prior to the breakout and the MACD, which later printed a bull cross, added an additional layer of confirmation of the bullish outlook for the beginning of the month. After several unsuccessful attempts to surpass the higher set of resistances (R1) bitcoin plummeted on Sept. 14, when it continued to toy with the second pivot point and traded more or less sideways along the supports (S1 + S2) for three days.Finally, bitcoin’s price broke down through the pivot and both supports on Sept. 17. Each instance had multiple indicators that confirmed the bullish or bearish moves as either a resistance/support test or a legit breakdown/rally including volume, which featured heavily during bitcoin’s most recent breakdown to $6,200.Pivot points are a useful addition to your technical toolbox for their ability to confirm support and resistance levels as well as judging the strength and significance of big price moves. They can help determine when to enter or exit a particular trade based on the positioning of the price, adding a useful layer of confirmation to your technical analysis when charting the safest route. Disclosure: The author holds USDT at the time of writing.

Instead, it bounced back from $6,170 — the support of the trendline connecting the June low and Aug. 11 low — and closed largely unchanged on the day at $6,290.At press time, BTC is changing hands at $6,250 on Bitfinex and the trendline support is seen slightly higher at $6,180.As seen in the above chart, the lower end of the pennant pattern – the trendline sloping upwards from the June low – is proving a tough nut to crack. This could be considered a sign of bearish exhaustion, given that the crucial support is holding ground after a 16 percent drop.That argument has merit since the cryptocurrency created a “spinning bottom” candle yesterday, signaling indecision in the marketplace.A UTC close today above $6,400 (previous day’s high) would validate the spinning bottom candle, opening doors to a stronger corrective rally toward $6,830 (10-week moving average).On the other hand, acceptance below the pennant support will likely accentuate the bear case.Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.Chart image via Shutterstock; Charts by Trading View"

After all, IoT is a broad category that includes everything from pocket-sized temperature sensors to internet-connected automobiles. As such, all or some of the devices in an IoT network might not be able to solve very complex PoW puzzles. Hence the impetus to make PoW energy-efficient, according to the IBM researchers’ paper: “Efficiency in IoT can be defined as an optimal utilization of hardware resources and energy. Therefore, in order to achieve that, the IoT devices on the blockchain should optimally utilize resources and energy to maintain and progress the blockchain.”Their proposed solution takes advantage of the fact that not all nodes on a network have to engage in mining. (Many dedicated bitcoin users, for example, simply run full nodes to check miners’ work and keep them honest.) Working on a testnet, or simulated blockchain environment, the IBM researchers have been dividing the nodes into small groups of 250 to 1,000 and then allowing an algorithm to decide what proportion of each group should be doing the mining work, depending on the amount of power used by each node and the security required. This, they say, gains optimum results in terms of conserving power while preserving security.“At the moment we look at blockchains like totally flat peer-to-peer systems, in which all the nodes have to do the same things, compete against each other to get that mining reward, for instance,” Dr. Emanuele Ragnoli, technical lead at the IBM Research – Ireland, told CoinDesk. “But you don’t need everybody to do the same type of job.”Ragnoli said he wanted to create a “layered ecosystem” in which different peers can do different things, thanks to clever algorithms which cluster nodes according to their capability and assign specific duties to them.“Some of the nodes do the full PoW, like you have in bitcoin,” said Ragnoli. “They do that because of the analytics behind the blockchain, which can actually see whether a device can do that kind of job, and place that device accordingly into a cluster of other devices that will be assigned a certain type of consensus.”The “sub-blockchains” maintained by these node groups are then connected using interoperability technologies such as Cosmos and Polkadot. In a nod to this patchwork, the IBM Research team has dubbed its lab project “Hybrid IoT Blockchain.”Stepping back, the IBM Research work is part of a broader push to create a future machine-to-machine economy, in which devices would have their own blockchain wallets and trade with each other (picture one self-driving car paying another for the right of way).But Ragnoli is realistic about the scale of the IoT challenge for blockchains, saying this world is still a “huge set of leaps” away.Attempting to take on a bite-sized chunk, his team investigated how a machine-to-machine ecosystem might work in an industrial setting, connecting cutting-edge manufacturing activities between a number of factories in the Netherlands. (IBM wouldn’t identify the enterprises involved but said there is a consortium on the horizon.)“Nowadays in industry 4.0, or manufacturing, you have many different factories that collaborate with each other to create a single product,” Ragnoli said. “So you have sensors, machines, even algorithms and analytics operating in the different factories, and inside the same factory, that the need to interoperate with each other.”From linking these factory devices together with the hybrid model, IBM found that arranging nodes in clusters of about 250, with 7% of those sub-blockchains doing PoW, achieved the best in terms of scaling, without sacrificing the hard-won security associated with PoW.“We are taking common consensus algorithms like PoW, the vision of Cosmos, etc., and we are altering ways of putting them together. The way we are designing this is like small Lego blocks, driven by the AI layer,” said Ragnoli.The IBM Research project is notable because it suggests that the deterministic requirements of blockchains can be combined with the black box of AI, allowing machine learning algorithms to alter the shape of blockchains to adapt to power or latency limitations, without compromising security. As such, this would seem to open the door to a whole new design space.“Why not augment the blockchain with analytics and AI algorithms that can actually shape the blockchain in a way that it helps it to overcome some of the limitations that are out there now?” said Ragnoli.In the case of IoT, the way this works is the AI receives as an input the IoT devices that are on the system and the available resources of those devices. It also assesses the overall security requirements of the system and decides which and how many devices are mining, the PoW difficulty, the block generation rate, the block size and tries to balance between required security and scalability.Therefore, IoT devices can still perform their application-specific tasks, such as data processing, and concurrently continue to mine blocks.So how could this work impact the world of cryptocurrencies? Merely saying that PoW just needs to be better organized is like saying the free market could be more efficient.Ragnoli said there could be a possibility to alter the way trading systems work in a dynamic way with different currencies, adding, “I’ve not gone as deep as actually altering the cryptographic consensus within – although that is actually a very interesting direction to explore.”IBM image via Consensus archives "

I also remember the phrase that really grabbed my attention:“We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer distributed timestamp server to generate computational proof of the chronological order of transactions…”Of course, at the moment, I thought, “Whoa, this can’t be true. How can he possibly have a solution to the double-spend problem that is peer to peer?”Up until Satoshi’s innovation, the double-spend was the Achilles’ heel of digital currency transactions – it simply wasn’t possible for a digital system to prove two, or more, different people didn’t spend the same digital money without the use of an intermediary. Despite advances in payment tech and services (the forebears of bitcoin already existed in technologies like DigiCash), all internet-based transactions still required a trusted third-party such as a bank, government or a credit card company.Trust is a component of traditional payment schemes such as credit cards, ACH or bank wires, but involving third-parties into payments adds friction at the cost of time and money. These payment schemes all address the problem that fiat money is a paper-based bearer instrument that can only be transferred peer-to-peer in person, in the physical world. That assumes that paper money cannot be copied which, of course, it can be.Solving the double-spend problem in the digital world makes near real-time commerce possible across the entire planet without regard to individual banking access, currency denominations or geographical location.I think a large part of bitcoin’s success is that it was the right idea at the right time. Between the financial crisis of 2008 and the fallout and subsequent crackdown following 9/11, banking regulations and best practices changed dramatically.The result was that banks were becoming more and more inaccessible for those “stuck” in the cash economy — money transfer, checking and debit services, and obtaining credit became harder and more costly. This trend definitely impacted consumers, but it also created a higher hurdle for retail banking and financial innovation.At the time of the bitcoin white paper’s publication, I was building a company in the global mobile banking space. One of the biggest obstacles for growth was managing for all of the needs of different banking and regulatory requirements. Those requirements turned into constraints that proved untenable at scale.So, in that context, solving the double-spend problem opened a massive technological frontier that allowed for experimentation and the design and deployment of a new financial sector. The true beauty of bitcoin is that it’s based on open-source computer code and it’s not owned or controlled by anyone. It is globally accessible in that the only requirement for participation in the new economy is an internet connected device.Right in the bitcoin genesis block, Satoshi warns of bank bailouts. History leaves clues and those who don’t understand history are doomed to repeat it.But, solving the double-spend problem wasn’t just a milestone achievement in computer science. We are only 10 years in, but already we can see the far-reaching results of what a permissionless, distributed economy can look like – and what the impacts might be.At this point, it’s clear that bitcoin is not just a new feature set of the existing economy, but that it is fueling its own economy that will be built on different principles then what came before.By eliminating the need for a centralized middle-man, bitcoin created the foundation for an entirely new banking infrastructure. By design, the infrastructure is incredibly secure. It was created as a protocol that allows other layers, apps, and services to be built on top of it.And that’s what we are seeing now the emergence of bitcoin service providers. Think about Lightning, Abra and LocalBitcoins as real examples.Today, companies are building bitcoin services that range from exchanges, that serve as basic on and off ramps for transfers of value from legacy systems to crypto-based systems, and back again. New companies are using bitcoin to rethink credit and lending, while others are using the technology to make creating and securing a digital identity more straightforward.It’s exciting to think about all that has been made possible — and will be made possible thanks to bitcoin. Bitcoin gives us the ability to be build a future based on sound and programmable money.In the future, bitcoin will make all kinds of financial innovation possible. At Abra, we are particularly interested in making money borderless (the company was founded to address this issue of near-free and private person-to-person money transfers).We are also interested in how bitcoin will enable consumer asset financing in the form of pay-as-you-go style arrangements. Think of it as a hardware as a service model, which will not only be massive for technology adoption in developing economies but also create opportunities to tackle issues related to poverty and global public health.We also foresee a world of micro-investing in stocks, bonds, mutual funds, etc., all made possible by bitcoin’s programmable money attributes. Abra’s synthetic assets are bitcoin collateralized contracts that make this type of micro-investing a reality today. Our goal is to democratize access to investment opportunities on a global scale.The programmable facets of bitcoin make these ideas possible, and the greatest part is that the consumer or investor won’t even need to know that they are utilizing bitcoin. Just like today’s internet user doesn’t understand the ins and outs of TCP/IP when they watch a Netflix or Youtube video, the bitcoin users’ experience will someday be invisible and seamless.Solving the double-spend problem helped move the internet one step closer to its initial promise of an open information network. By eliminating the need for trusted third-parties, bitcoin has become the foundation for the ultimate economic freedom.Two coins via Shutterstock"

Binance’s Zhao Changpeng, Huobi’s Li Lin and OKCoin’s Star Xu, are the next on the list among the richest cryptocurrency entrepreneurs, with $2.1 billion, $1.4 billion, and $1 billion in net worth, respectively.The report also estimated the wealth of Li Xiaolai, the English teacher-turned crypto investor, at around 7 billion yuan, or $1 billion.Also notably, six out of the total 13 crypto executives who made it to the list are from Bitmain, while three come from the firm’s rival chip maker Canaan Creative. Another hails from the network hardware-turned bitcoin miner maker Ebang.So far, all of the three mining firms have filed applications to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, seeking to go public in the Chinese autonomous territory and economic hub.

Further, volatility readings have hit multi-month lows, indicating a big move up or down is overdue.For instance, volatility, as indicated by Bollinger bandwidth, fell to its lowest in nearly two years on Sept. 26 and has remained low since. Yet, the big move still hasn’t materialized.Under such circumstances, most traders prefer to wait on the sidelines and enter the market after the range has been breached. So, having a tool which might indicate that BTC is in the early stages of a big move would boost traders’ ability to time the impending breakout.One such technical tool is the choppiness index, which oscillates between 0.00 and 100.00. Above 61.8 means the market lacks a clear directional bias and is likely to continue sideways trading. On the other hand, a reading below 38.2 indicates strong bullish or bearish bias.Notably, the 61.8 level can be used to determine range breakout too, when the market is exhibiting choppiness.The choppiness index is currently holding above 61.8, meaning the bitcoin market has remained stuck in range for a long period. However, traders should watch for a move below 61.8 – considered an early indication that an asset is preparing for a direction breakout.As of writing, the index is located at 63.00.Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.Bitcoin image via Shutterstock; Charts by Trading View"

Only miners – those that run hardware and spend energy ordering transactions on the network – can exploit the vulnerability by double spending a transaction and placing it in a block.But, it’s not exactly painless for them to execute, either. If they try the attack, they would lose their block reward, which is worth more than $75,000 at today’s prices.The vulnerability was introduced in Bitcoin Core version 0.14.0, which was first released in March 2017. But the issue wasn’t found until just two days ago, prompting contributors to the codebase to take action and ultimately release a tested fix within 24 hours.And luckily, most bitcoin users don’t have to do anything to be protected from the vulnerability now.Developers stressed that “stored” bitcoins are not at risk. Yet, it could impact those using the Lightning network, an in-development transaction layer that seeks to allow faster and cheaper transactions.Still, because the bug is potentially dangerous for the network, developers strongly advise users who are running so-called “full nodes” that store bitcoin’s complete transaction history to upgrade their software. Moderator Theymos also pinned a notice to the top of the bitcoin subreddit.The Bitcoin Core notes describing the software patch state:“We urge all network participants to upgrade to [the new software] as soon as possible.”As it turns out, a popular quote in tech circles aptly applies to this kind of bug.“A distributed system is one in which the failure of a computer you didn’t even know existed can render your own computer unusable,” said famous computer scientist Leslie Lamport.In this particular circumstance, a miner making a faulty transaction can impact nodes running across the network. As noted in the Bitcoin OpTech newsletter, a miner would need to try to double spend some bitcoin in order to crash bitcoin nodes.Bitcoin’s code is set up to largely to guard against this kind of problem, but this bug shows how a way around such measures managed to seep through.Perhaps the biggest impact is on bitcoin-tied technology that isn’t ready for primetime. If this attack were to be executed, bitcoin users running Lightning on the mainnet could be impacted.“If you’re reckless enough to be running lightning, you should really update ASAP, or close your channels. Updating is easy enough luckily,” Blockstream engineer Gregory Sanders urged on reddit.Since Lightning is in such an early stage, it requires users to watch their “channels,” which hold their bitcoins in the experimental layer. That way they can stop a party they’ve established a channel with if that party attempts to cheat. Of particular concern here though: if a user’s node is crashed by a miner exploiting this bug, a malicious actor could use the opportunity to cheat other Lightning users.Even so, some developers argue that successfully doing all of this would be pretty hard to accomplish.“I find it highly unlikely it has much of an impact,” developer Justin Camarena told CoinDesk.That’s why some argue that regular users don’t need to worry about it, although there’s been a general sense of urgency in light of the overall risk.“Unless you’re running a business or lightning network node you really have no funds at risk,” Sanders added later.Yet how significant this bug is in the context of bitcoin’s history remains difficult to figure out.Blockchain.info data engineer Antoine Le Calvez tallied up a list of similar exploits made over the years, showing that they were more common in bitcoin’s earlier years.But Bitcoin Core contributor Luke Dashjr responded by arguing that exploits might not be decreasing over time as the data suggests.“Sadly, I think recent years suffer from lack of disclosure rather than having fewer exploits,” he said.He went on to admit he doesn’t know why this is the case, but he nonetheless argued that some bugs in the bitcoin software are found and patched up, yet are never publicly disclosed.Meanwhile, others are drawing other conclusions from the bug – namely that bitcoin programmers are mere mortals. OpenBazaar lead developer Chris Pacia went as far as to argue that while many users argue that bitcoin developers are among the best in the world, this proves they’re actually normal developers who run into obstacles.“Bugs happen. This is a fact of life,” he remarked on Twitter. “I’m not criticizing them for having a bug. I’m criticizing the idiot minimalists who insist Core developers are God-like individuals.”Still, Camarena thinks that because of the bug’s nuances and how difficult the attack is to execute, people are making too big of a deal out of the bug.He told CoinDesk:“It’s a serious bug, but not as bad as some are making it to believe.”TV without signal image via Shutterstock"

When questioned, a spokesperson told CoinDesk the company is”not aware of such a problem.”Caixin indicated the group of investors spotted Xu’s whereabouts by following his personal trainer to the hotel where he was staying on Monday, and went managed to bring about a face-to-face dispute. Xu subsequently called the police, after which officers arrived to take both Xu and the investors to the police department for further questioning, according to the report.On Tuesday morning, more investors who allegedly suffered from the system crash arrived at the Shanghai police station to submit materials seeking to prove their accusation, Caixin said.The Weifang Xincun precinct couldn’t be reached for comment to confirm who initially called the police and whether Xu was questioned as a witness or as a suspect.In a response to a CoinDesk enquiry, OKEx said:“As far as OKEx is aware, it was Xu who called the police for help when he was surrounded and intimidated by a gang during his visit in Shanghai. The Shanghai police officers arrived the scene and invited all the related parties back to the police station. … Xu was then invited for questioning while the gang was detained. Then Xu left the police station.”The firm further said that Xu was the founder of the OKCoin exchange but now is the head of OK Group. As such the company claimed Xu currently does not represent OKEx “in any way” since the exchange does not belong to the group.Addressing reports in the crypto media yesterday suggesting Xu had been arrested, they also stated: “It is unfortunate that the story was twisted.”A Chinese business registration database indicates that OKEx belongs to a company that also operates OKCoin.Star Xu image via TNABC/Joshua Dykgraaf"

And what had perhaps been unthinkable in the years previous, by 2017 the largest crypto wallets in BitGo’s charge reached close to $1 billion.Looking ahead to the next milestone, BitGo CEO Mike Belshe will give a talk next month at Stanford University entitled “Securing the Trillion Dollar Wallet.” In a world of tokenized everything – not to mention hedge funds and other institutions redefining the meaning of a whale crypto investor – this no longer seems far-fetched.“Now we are really thinking, what’s it going to take to secure a trillion dollars?” Belshe told CoinDesk. “It may be a little far away, but we have to start thinking about it now; we have to start designing it now in order to get there.”Designing a system like this involves a complex blend of hardware and software, policies and procedures, not to mention meeting externally audited regulatory requirements (BitGo recently received approval in the U.S.to act as a qualified custodian for digital assets on behalf of institutional investors).However, as one security consultant told Belshe’s team, building a secure vault for such a large sum of money basically comes down to two things: kids and fingers.It’s one thing to keep the cryptographic private key controlling a bitcoin wallet in cold storage, i.e. on a piece of paper or a hardware device disconnected from the internet and locked in a safe. But if a bad guy comes into your office and is ready to cut off your finger or put a gun to your child’s head, what are you going to do? Obviously, quick and ready access to those assets means the security will be cracked.The trick is to marry technology with process and controls such that it’s difficult to get the money out – or at least so that moving the vast majority of the assets involves lots of independent, separate people whose key signatures are all required, said Belshe.He added:“Some of the technology guys out there are saying, ‘hey we can get you out of cold storage in 10 minutes.’ I’m sorry, but if you can get a billion dollars out of cold storage in 10 minutes, that means there’s somebody’s finger that you can threaten.”Stepping back, becoming a qualified custodian has taken Belshe years and has seen BitGo come close to acquiring qualified custodian Kingdom Trust, before going it alone to establish BitGo Trust.With the addition of a regulated trust function, BitGo, which currently handles around $15 billion in monthly crypto transactions, is arguably pulling ahead in the race to secure digital assets for the institutional set. Competitors in this space include the hardware maker Ledger, the traditional U.S. custodial bank Northern Trust, and blockchain startup itBit.But Belshe views the inevitable evolution towards digital assets as a rising tide that will benefit everyone in the industry. He also admitted clients are really looking for custodians with big balance sheets, something which BitGo does not have today.“I would love if the big players came in and put their balance sheet behind the security of their custodianship of digital assets. It would be amazing for all of us,” he said.Since the 2008 crash, the onus has been on diversifying custody arrangements, something the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has encouraged. These days, hedge funds will often be using 15 to 20 custodians with perhaps only 5% in each to limit their exposure, noted Belshe.He said BitGo has been in talks with many hedge funds and found there are “literally dozens” that can’t wait to use its trust service.In the detail, achieving parity with established qualified custody providers involves gaining third-party certification of policies and procedures, or SOCs (system and organization controls). BitGo has now attained SOC I and II certifications, with the auditing of those carried out by Deloitte.It’s a length which few, if any, other crypto companies have gone to, said Belshe, and it encompasses a wide range of eventualities.“You can have the most secure software in the world and the most secure hardware. But inside your company what’s the policy for keeping things safe? What happens if your data center goes down?” he said. “We have policy, procedures and plans for all this, that have been tested and are in place.”Following BitGo’s qualified custodian announcement, the startup’s next big step is a crypto insurance product to be released within a couple of months. Such insurance typically covers investors for risks such as theft.BitGo wouldn’t write the policies, but rather white-label the product with an established insurer. Belshe wants to do this right and has amassed a deep knowledge of the subject along the way. The experience has left him circumspect whenever he hears about crypto insurance being offered in the market.“The insurance claims out there are wide and wild and often not really of value,” Belshe said (meaning “claims” as in representations about insurance, not requests for payment from an insurer). “Anybody that’s looking at insurance, or a provider that claims to be insured, ask them to really show you what the [coverage] limits are.”This can take some digging. As hard as it is to differentiate BitGo’s cold storage from somebody else’s cold storage solution, it’s equally hard to differentiate one claim of full insurance from another, said Belshe. Oftentimes, you’re dealing with small policies of $10 million or less that may not even cover theft.Typically the questions that need answering are: Who is the underwriter? What cases are covered? What about insider theft? What about executive insider theft? What are the caps, what are the deductibles? Can you cover your deductibles?Belshe acknowledged that underwriters are there to provide a service and don’t want to be used as marketing, but in the end, full transparency has to be made available for customers.Someone offering a great insurance program would find a way to get “solid green lights” from anyone who wanted to review it, even if they had to do that under a non-disclosure agreement (NDA), said Belshe, concluding,“If they are not willing to talk to you about it, it’s a red flag. I guarantee you, if it’s in secret, there’s a reason it’s in secret.” Correction: the original version of this story stated that firms were waiting for the end of a 30-day review period to use the qualified custodian service. That review period had ended.BitGo at Consensus image from CoinDesk archives"

As detailed by CoinDesk, Taaki is also ...","Oct 11, 2018 at 00:05 UTC",A region home to 4 million people in Northern Syria is looking to cryptocurrency as a way to overcome economic sanctions.,"Rojava, also known as the Democratic Federation of Northern Syria, has spent the last six years at war for its territory. Now under a fragile peace, the region is under economic sanctions from all sides – Turkey, Iran, Syria, Iraq. In the midst of this uncertainty, however, those backing the state are putting a new emphasis on monetary independence.Because its primary currency is the Syrian lira, the main currency of the Syrian state (which Rojava has just spent years fighting), there’s a growing belief in some quarters that cryptocurrency could provide a better alternative, Erselan Serdem, a leader of Rojava’s technological development program, told CoinDesk.Alongside a system of self-governing communes, Rojava plans to implement new technological academies, with a particular emphasis on cryptography and cryptocurrency, Serdem said.Assisting the change is Amir Taaki, an early bitcoin developer who fought alongside Rojava in the war. As detailed by CoinDesk, Taaki is also in the process of setting up a European-based technological academy in Barcelona.“[Rojava is] a revolutionary project that wants to build a new society based on anarchist principles, and that means law, defense, society and culture,” Taaki told CoinDesk.The new academies follow the philosophy of Kurdish political theorist Abdullah Ocalan, who is promoting a form of governance called “democratic confederalism.” Advocating for direct democracy, feminism and ecology, Serdem said that blockchain and cryptocurrency are crucial for achieving this vision.“You need technology to spend less water, you need technology to have an equal relation with the earth, you need technology to use networks, like the blockchain. We see blockchain as a practical network in society that people use,” Serdem said.And while achieving adoption for a cryptocurrency throughout the region is an ambitious project, Serdem believes Rojava’s experience in war has given it the ability to both organize effectively and to set a positive example for the world.“We have to think deeply about the future of the new system, and how the people can arrange and manage resources democratically without any form of centralization,” Serdem continued, adding:“We call our system a decentralized system of society.”The push toward cryptocurrency is notable because, at the time of writing, Rojava’s economy is based purely on paper currencies, according to Taaki, who spent nearly two years in the country during the conflict.Taaki reports that, as a consequence, a large infrastructure has developed around the processing of fiat currencies, with centers throughout the country dedicated solely to accounting. Combined with high inflation, this means that locals depend on large amounts of cash to secure trades.Economic sanctions with neighboring countries also mean that in order to send money outside the region, payments are subject to high fees.“The cost of making a transaction with Istanbul is currently 10 percent,” Taaki said, “We believe that with cryptocurrency we can make this 2 percent globally, not just with Istanbul.”As such, Taaki said the first steps are to equip local currency exchanges with bitcoin and providing residents with wallet software that has been translated into local languages. Additionally, payment infrastructures such as bitcoin’s lightning network, or a custom payment network, could be deployed to make trade fast, cheap and secure.Research is currently being conducted into solutions that don’t rely on the internet, such as cryptocurrency transmitted over radio, and paper-based currencies that are pegged to crypto.“Not everybody has mobile phones, so we see research into paper currency as an important project,” Taaki said.Yet, while work still remains before cryptocurrency adoption is actionable in the region, Taaki and Serdem emphasized that the steps are necessary to ensure Rojava’s autonomy from neighboring forces.“We do not like to depend on the Syrian government money, which is state money, we want to trade our own cryptocurrency,” Serdem said.Still, he emphasized that an underlying analysis must be completed before cryptocurrency can be implemented, one that will require intensive documentation of human population and surveys of geography and natural resources, such as oil, water and sunlight.“It’s about resources,” Serdem said, “To create academies you need to have a resource, to make blockchain network we also need resources. We need to calculate all the resources and use it in the process.”Underpinning Rojava’s new society is a system of cooperatives that each fulfill different functions within society.For example, cooperatives that perform roles like healthcare, agriculture, media and the arts, are comprised of volunteers – maintaining a strong principle of non-coercion. Going forward, Taaki said the technological committee will help establish local cryptocurrencies to allow these cooperatives to engage in trade, as well as issuing financial instruments that can be used for fundraising.“The cooperatives can trade with each other based on currencies that are pegged to a basket of goods, or just free floating in the market,” Taaki said.Additionally, the technological committee has plans to use blockchain beyond its implications in finance as well.For example, Serdem said that blockchain could be deployed as a new governance infrastructure that allows for distributed, democratic control and a high level of transparency.“With technologies like blockchain we can have a system, like a network, between all the communes we’re going to create in the future,” Serdem said,“With the base of the blockchain we can create a process of self administration. We can distribute all the roles in the society.”Toward this, the technological committee will experiment with new forms of digital governance that fulfill Rojava’s democratic ideals.For example, blockchain technologies could allow people to assert power over institutions, to establish smart contracts to formalize relationships and to oversee operations in a transparent manner.“Rojava is a good opportunity to see how it works in practice,” Serdem said.With these tools, Rojava wishes to set an example of democratic society throughout the Middle East and the world.Crucially, Serdem emphasized that such change will be achieved not by violent measures, but by demonstrating to the world that another system is possible – one that operates in tandem with ecology, autonomy and self-administration.“We do not use the force to develop this idea, it’s about evolution,” Serdem said.Such evolution resides on a subtle updating of old systems with new technologies, Serdem continued, that lends the movement a strength that former revolutions haven’t achieved.Additionally, the project looks to attract allies throughout the world, “revolutionary hackers,” Serdem said, that can help the project realize itself.“We know that there are many people with the expertise and with the philosophy. They know very well the current system doesn’t work. Globally, it doesn’t work,” Serdem continued.In part, Taaki’s efforts in Europe to attract idealistic young programmers interested in putting ideas of decentralized, societal change into practice are related to this.According to Serdem, Rojava represents the last opportunity for which such a revolution in possible – to overthrow the old system of globalization, capitalist exploitation and a new form of consumer slavery.“Rojava, this is for me, this is the last opportunity for humans,” Serdem told CoinDesk, concluding:“We need to create this as an example. Rojava can be our first step of how we can be captain of our planet which is occupied by the old system.”YPG fighters via Kurdish Struggle/Flickr"

Like another famous white paper, Alan Turing’s “Computing Machinery and Intelligence,” bitcoin’s was clear and scientific, describing with authority a particular – and new – idea.This is an important differentiator. We tend to think of bitcoin as the network, nodes, miners and HODLers, but it’s really an idea, first expressed in the white paper. (Many so-called white papers today are simply marketing or legal documents.)Everything that came after, including the code, is a continuation of that idea. An ideal white paper, then, is an objective description of an idea. Beliefs about what the idea means can change, but if an idea is good people will build on it.The concept of bitcoin as an idea is basic, but it’s also easy to misunderstand.Bitcoin was a new invention that could do things that were not possible before. The world just does not work the same way as it did before the existence of the bitcoin white paper and its idea. That’s a big distinction from describing an idea based on an existing invention.One can argue that they think an idea is bad or they can say that they think that it won’t have much application or adoption. There are valid debates about the technology, but the basis for them should acknowledge that the idea exists and is indeed new.At least for now, bitcoin does work. It also works in a different way than anything else before it ever worked: this is important. Those who criticize the technology without understanding what it can do as “nothing more than a database” are missing this key point.It really is a new idea and can do things differently.Once we have a basis to agree what an idea is, we can begin work on that idea.I was early enough in bitcoin to see this firsthand: a mostly unified vision of what this experiment might do. In those early days, there was also much less focus on day-to-day economics. Early on, it’s easy to gather around a vision. As time goes on and interpretations of the idea change, there will be differing opinions about direction.
White papers, like bitcoin’s, both help people gather around an idea that they share in common and serve as a guideline for future people working on that idea.When those interested in bitcoin as an idea differ on the direction of a project, they can choose from several options:Ideas, at least at first, are always centralized.On day one, no one really disagrees about what that idea means. The creators of that idea can be very clear and no one can say “this is what you meant.” This key early centralized authority to define and start a project is crucial.But as bitcoin adapts and grows, we’re seeing that disagreement unfolds in a special way.Bitcoin is like planting a forest: an idea started with somebody planting a seed. In the case of the bitcoin white paper, the planter was Satoshi Nakamoto.Then people come along to water that seed (early developers). Then more people help: other developers, companies, and individuals begin to support it. People take clippings from this little tree that’s now growing and they plant their own copies of it.Some are an identical copy, some use the same seeds, some are clones. Some are mutants, some are what some call weeds. Some die.Eventually a whole bunch of people plant more plants, water them, feed branches and together we built a forest. It’s in the later stages that it gets more and more tricky. As systems become large and complex, there are more stakeholders and disagreements.It is inevitable that there will be shifts and splits, fragments and schisms. You can hang out in any section of that forest you want.But when people disagree, bitcoin (the idea) has a unique mechanism to deal with this (as do other the projects which copy it in form and substance). Bitcoin is a huge network now with diverse participants with diverse goals. Many of these participants may or may not like every aspect of the way that bitcoin evolves.But, we all have shared incentive as participants in the network to make the work network work. If it is got a network effect and it’s secure, then we are going to continue to use it.A key part of the invention is that bitcoin is designed to prevent mob rule.Efforts in the past in global politics have worked on trying to fight, control or end mobs. In crypto, mobs can go their own way. People who agree to a certain set of rules can participate on a network with any set of rules that they agree with.The mob does not have the ability to outvote them. They can still run that chain. The only effect other individuals can have is to move elsewhere and build something new. If it makes your system obsolete then you can choose to follow them.Inevitably as with all important texts, we had major groups which fractured and disagreed over their interpretation of the paper.Ultimately, in bitcoin, each party is able to run the code that they prefer based on the rules that they like. People are free to choose their own personal interpretation of what the white paper means (or whether that is even relevant or important).The success and popularity of bitcoin helps to contribute to a new governance system. This could perhaps affect commerce and other voluntary interactions: the ability to voluntarily run the code with the rules you want.Many people do not understand this. We still have people concerned about the centralization and control over bitcoin by key developers or companies. Other projects may have more centralized or influential personalities. While certain people have great *influence* over some projects, they only have control if they control consensus.This is what’s great about decentralized open-source projects, and it’s a critical part of bitcoin as an idea.Running code is like running your own personal Constitution. When you run the bitcoin software, you are agreeing to a set of rules that can’t be affected by mob rule. If times or your beliefs change, the system allows you to adapt and change with the rules you prefer.Whatever comes next, the white paper will be the root of it all.Formal penmanship image via Shutterstock"

Today’s 15 percent depreciation has led the market to its lowest value since Oct. 31 of last year, CoinMarketCap data reveals.Other major cryptocurrencies are reporting declines in excess of 10 percent on the day, including ETH, XRP and bitcoin cash – the latter of which is gearing up for a contentious hard fork on Nov. 15.Notably, market data indicates that in light of today’s market drop, XRP (as of the time of this writing) has the second-largest market capitalization for cryptocurrencies, surpassing ETH.USDT, the stablecoin known more commonly as tether, saw a notable drop in its price to a low of $0.95 on crypto exchange Kraken, which offers one of the few trading pairs of the token against the U.S. dollar.Tether, among other stablecoins, is intended to hold parity against the U.S. dollar, and data from CoinMarketCap shows that the token is trading in the $0.96-$0.97 range.Because of the dip in USDT, the BTC premium on exchanges like Bitfinex, which trades against USDT, has risen to over $300. In other words, a single unit of bitcoin can now be purchased for $5,557 on Coinbase (a regulated exchange trading against USD) while the same unit costs $5,870 USDT on Bitfinex.Disclosure: The author holds BTC, AST, REQ, OMG, FUEL, 1st and AMP at the time of writing.Bear-gold-bitcoin-cryptocurrency-mouth-on image via Shutterstock; Graph via CoinMarketCap"

Wu further said said that, in tests, the chip “can achieve a ratio of energy consumption to mining capacity that is as low as 42J/TH.”So far the firm has not released detailed specifications for the new ASIC. However, Bitmain says it is now moving to mass-produce the new ASIC.As reported by CoinDesk, Bitfury launched its 14nm Clarke chip Wednesday, saying it “offers the strongest performance among bitcoin mining chips and is unparalleled in efficiency.” The ASIC is said to have power efficiency up to 55 mW/GH and a hashrate up to 120 GH/s.In June, Japanese tech giant GMO also said it was launching the “world’s first” 7nm ASIC, slating the first shipments for October.According to a report at the time, the chip was to be fitted in a new miner called the B2. That machine will reportedly provide a hash rate of 24TH/s and power consumption of 1,950W per unit – which breaks down to 81W per 1 TH/s.Jihan Wu image via CoinDesk"
106,www.coindesk.com,"Oct 5, 2018",VOIP Pioneer Says New Startup Is Paying Users Interest on ...,https://www.coindesk.com/crypto-wallet-loans-bitcoin-eth,"Celsius, a cryptocurrency lending startup, says it's paying thousands of 
users interest for depositing bitcoin and ether with its wallet app.","Oct 5, 2018 at 12:30 UTC","Celsius, a cryptocurrency lending startup, says it’s paying thousands of users interest for depositing bitcoin and ether with its wallet app.","Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, Celsius claims to have garnered more than 10,000 users since the soft launch of its mobile app on June 29, with an average deposit of 0.5 bitcoin or 5.5 ether earning up to 6.7 percent on an annualized basis. The interest comes from income Celsius makes lending fiat and crypto, much of the latter to hedge funds that want to short, or bet against, the coins.“When we make interest income we pay a chunk of that back to the people who gave us BTC,” said Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky, who’s best known as a pioneer of Voice over Internet Protocol (VOIP), the technology that allows phone calls via cyberspace.Celsius raised $50 million in an initial coin offering last year, selling a token called CEL. Since then, it has gathered crypto deposits worth several million dollars, with hundreds of new users joining the platform each week in September, the company said.Stepping back, interest-earning opportunities for crypto users are rare and may be particularly welcome in the current bear market as coin prices languish. As reported by CoinDesk, a rival company, Compound, launched last month, allowing people to invest crypto in a pool of short-term loans similar to a money market fund.Yet crypto and lending often don’t mix well. For instance, BTCJam and BitLendingClub, two peer-to-peer lending platforms, both wound down in 2016, citing regulatory issues. The individuals lending on these platforms had little recourse when the borrower defaulted, apart from online arbitration and, failing that, court.Moreover, the ups and downs of crypto prices can only amplify the risk inherent in lending money.“To be able to consistently provide that return in assets that are so volatile is always going to be hard,” said blockchain consultant Angus Champion de Crespigny.Celsius, though, requires collateral for all its loans and it operates more like a bank than a P2P platform. The startup also boasts gravitas: In addition to telecom veteran Mashinsky, it counts academic cryptographer Scott Stornetta, who was cited multiple times in the original bitcoin white paper, as an advisor.And beyond its current model, Celsius has a grand vision of putting its activities on its own blockchain.Unlike new rival Compound, which strictly lends crypto, most Celsius loans are issued in fiat, although the company requires crypto to be pledged as collateral for these.Mashinsky told CoinDesk that Celsius’ custodial crypto wallet, offered through a partnership with the qualified custodian BitGo, resembles a bank account in that users earn interest on their deposits every Monday.Even as they do so, Celsius wallet users can withdraw their deposits at any time to a non-custodial wallet, or one where they control the private keys. In this way, the wallet resembles an interest-bearing checking account (though to be clear, there’s no federal deposit insurance here).Also like a bank, Celsius loans out part of the money deposited by crypto wallet users. The borrowers, typically hedge funds looking to sell the coin short, pledge dollars or other cryptos as collateral in these transactions, and pay interest in bitcoin.In addition to these crypto wallet deposits, “we have U.S. lenders who say ‘show us you have capital and then we will lend you dollars cheaply,'” Mashinksy said.On the asset side of its balance sheet, Celsius has generated a dozen fiat loans totaling roughly $11 million, with repayment periods ranging from 30 days to three years. The startup is finalizing a $10 million loan in XRP.The company also recently secured a deal to manage the United Nations Fifth Element crypto deposits from donors worldwide, assets the UN plans to deploy for various sustainability initiatives.Yet Celsius could eventually face more formidable rivals, like actual banks. According to de Crespigny, there’s no reason traditional financial institutions couldn’t offer a competing deposit service for crypto assets. “They [banks] are just evaluating the risk and rewards, the regulatory risks and the volatility of this product,” he said.Conversely, Celsius COO Daniel Leon argued that the startup could attract new users away from such institutions by consistently offering better returns to depositors and cheaper loans to borrowers without credit checks. He told CoinDesk:“We believe if we pay them [users] a little more, if we charge them a bit less, then we’re going to win.”One other thing Celsius has in common with banks: requiring know-your-customer identity checks.All things considered, Celsius hopes its biggest differentiator will be the auditable CEL blockchain, which it expects to launch by 2019.“We’re building our own blockchain that is going to provide total transparency on all our banking activities like no other service out there,” Leon said. “That’s our commitment to do this on a distributed ledger rather than a private server.”Even before the CEL blockchain launches, Celsius accepts this ethereum-based token as repayment regardless of whether the loan was in a different currency, in order to establish the utility value of the token.“It’s up to the user whether they repay in dollars or in CEL,” Mashinsky said.Once launched, the public CEL blockchain should allow users to audit every function performed across the platform, without revealing the identities of borrowers or depositors, the company says. Mashinsky said Celsius will use this blockchain to hold itself accountable for distributing all profits after operating costs to users.That vision is what persuaded Satoshi-cited cryptographer Stornetta to join Celsius as an advisor. He’s generally avoided involvement with crypto startups until now.“I made an exception, the first exception, for Celsius because I think their success is going to be a win for the entire blockchain community,” Stornetta told CoinDesk.Speaking to how Celsius offers services comparable to traditional banking, he concluded:“You have to take your idealism and couple it with the nuts and bolts of building a compelling, end-user value proposition.”Alex Mashinsky photo by Nikhilesh De for CoinDesk"

The terms of the deal, including the sale price, were not disclosed.Bitstamp backer Pantera Capital will also retain a 6 percent ownership stake in the exchange, according to statements, and Bitstamp will continue to operate independently.NXMH’s parent company, NXC, also owns the South Korean cryptocurrency exchange Korbit. NXC owns Nexon, a maker of popular games for both desktop and mobile platforms. Public filings released earlier this year had linked NXC and Bitstamp.Bitstamp’s customers will not see any immediate change in services, Kodrič told CoinDesk. The exchange has an existing roadmap for improvement, which it intends to stick to for the time being. During negotiations with NXMH, the investment firm essentially agreed with Bitstamp’s goals, he said.“We realized very early on that our outlook for the crypto industry is very much aligned with them,” he explained. “They’ve given us a lot of confidence that our execution will proceed … They understand the industry.”NXMH and Bitstamp will continue to work to “bridge the gap between traditional finance and crypto,” a goal that Bitstamp has been working toward for several years already, Kodrič said.He added:“Unlike some of our competitors who take more of a lax approach, we want to [set standards] … We’ve already taken the regulatory framework seriously starting back in 2014, we started doing [know-your-customer] before it was an industry standard. All of it comes down to us viewing crypto as being a spark of everyday life.”In a statement, NXMH investment manager Hendrik Ghys said, “Bitstamp is one of the oldest and most-respected cryptocurrency exchanges and we see positive growth potential as the industry continues to evolve … We acquired Bitstamp because we see it as a strategic, long-term investment.”According to the companies, Bitstamp will focus on improving user experience, customer service, trading functions and other operations, as well as maintaining a secure trading environment.Speaking to concerns about issues withdrawing funds, Kodrič noted that a number of corresponding banks began freezing or examining cryptocurrency-related transactions over the past few months, and mitigating customer impact is “a continuous process.”Similarly, the exchange is working to prevent its order books from displaying large amounts of volatility, he said.Earlier this month, a number of Reddit users commented on rapid bitcoin price fluctuations on the exchange, noting that the cryptocurrency’s price changed by as much as 28 percent over a few minutes.Preventing this sort of issue in the future is “on the top priority list,” Kodrič said. He explained that “there was a one client where its trading algorithm made some irrational choices and effectively triggered a couple of large orders on the market, which was later frozen.”“It was a mistake [by] the client, that cost them some money. As a part of some of the changes on the road map … specifically tied to technical improvements, we’ll [fix this],” he said.Bitstamp image Piotr Swat/Shutterstock"

That’s 1,207 downloads too many.”The team found that the malware was designed to steal data from users’ PCs ranging from browser autocomplete text to Steam sessions, and ultimately sends the ill-gotten info to an I.P. address in the Russian Federation.Of concern to cryptocurrency users, it also looks for data linked to bitcoin wallets – with one image provided in the report that shows the malware specifically seeks out data related to the Electrum wallet.While the malware itself likely isn’t new, the firm warns that it can still be damaging to those that install it.“Combining it with the current fever for new Fortnite content is a recipe for stolen data and a lot of cleanup required afterward,” the firm says.Fortnite image via Shutterstock"

simply based on informational changes in fundamental value,” Wei, who ...","Nov 7, 2018 at 10:00 UTC",The contentious nature of the ecosystem around cryptocurrencies is partly what gives them value – academics call it “belief heterogenity.”,"But discord and personal sentiment alone isn’t enough to keep prices above zero, according to research from Wang Chun Wei, Ph.D., a finance lecturer at the University of Queensland in Australia. According to Wei, if it was easier to bet against cryptocurrency prices through short positions – when someone borrows, then sells an asset with the expectation of buying it back at a lower price in an effort to make a profit on the difference  –  more of those assets would go to zero.“Daily volatility of bitcoin is around four percent. This is too high to be simply based on informational changes in fundamental value,” Wei, who previously studied whether Tether’s controversial stablecoin, USDT, could be used to prop up the price of bitcoin, told CoinDesk.As such, to investigate a better explanation for this observation, Wei looked at coins that most people would agree should be worth zero: cryptocurrencies believed to be either jokes or scams.His latest investigation into crypto values, first published in October, confirmed a longstanding theory of finance – something called the resale option hypothesis – at least partly explains why cryptocurrencies are valued the way they are today.The resale option hypothesis, which originated in 2003 from Princeton researchers Jose Scheinkman and Wei Xiong, argues that an asset tends to favor the most optimistic participants in a market (those with long bets) when two conditions persist: lots of disagreement about price and impediments to shorting the asset.“Both conditions exist in the crypto market,” Wei said.Without easy ways for people to short then, the market favors the long position.Wei told CoinDesk:“The hope that you can sell it to someone for more than what you paid for is an important factor driving cryptocurrency prices.”While Wei conducted his study on altcoins – particularly those with shady reputations – he reasoned that what he found should also explain some of the strangeness behind bitcoin’s price movements.For much of its history, the exact reasons for bitcoin’s price moves haven’t been readily apparent – these fundamentals mysterious even to the most devout maximalist.Wei studied three baskets of cryptocurrencies: mainstream coins, alleged scams and outright jokes.The mainstream basket included seven cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, ethereum, litecoin and XRP.The list of less-than-savory coins included the Ponzi scheme-tied Bitconnect, Urocoin (originally pitched as a coin for farmers) and ParagonCoin (a cannabis industry everything-coin).The joke-coin list featured dogecoin, RonPaulCoin and Useless Ethereum Token (UET) – the latter which wasn’t a true “scam” because its creator was forthright about his intention to take investor funds and run.According to Wei, differences of opinion help illuminate why joke coins tend to hold on to their price a bit longer than cryptocurrencies identified as fraudulent. While fraudulent tokens might hold onto their value even as suspicions mount, that eventually changes as the hustle is definitively revealed.“Once it becomes crystal clear that there’s no fundamental value, then you lose belief dispersion and the resale option value plummets,” Wei wrote in the paper.But if a coin was made in jest – without maliciousness – who’s to say it couldn’t be viewed as valuable regardless? he reasoned.So, how can this price effect be seen for the cryptocurrencies with bigger market capitalizations and wider network effects?Resale option value is, in itself, difficult to pin down.“There’s no precise way of calculating resale option value,” Wei wrote.In his paper, he tested “the statistical significance of the interactions between turnover, traded price and realized volatility” to infer a value.And based on that analysis, the hypothesis does apply to more mainstream coins.“We find mainstream cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, ethereum and [XRP], test positive to the resale option test,” Weid said. “This suggests that the price-volume relationship for mainstream cryptocurrencies exhibit speculative behavior, and thus it is unlikely that traded price for these cryptocurrencies reflect only fundamental value.”Indeed, according to Wei, the market got something of a real-world test of this idea recently as bitcoin futures began to trade on major markets starting at the end of last year.Wei told CoinDesk:“Theoretically, the introduction of shorting instruments should reduce the resale option value, and consequently reduce bitcoin price (the latter which we can see clearly).”Shorting options will soon expand for other cryptocurrencies as well. For example, Dydx is offering tokens for shorting, and crypto startup Compound has created a borrowing market that can be used for shorting coins.If Wei’s analysis proves accurate, that could increase pressure on more of the tokens that have been able to maintain higher prices.As Wei wrote in the paper, “Overall, we provide ample empirical evidence in support of anecdotal claims that cryptocurrency prices are supported by the hope of selling it to somebody else at a higher price.”Charts via Shutterstock"

of bitcoin. Because a 51 percent attack requires a miner to produce ...","Oct 10, 2018 at 12:59 UTC",One of crypto’s most feared attacks may have an elegant solution.,"At least, that’s according to the team behind cryptocurrency project Horizen – formerly zencash – which saw more than $500,000 hacked from an exchange in such an attack, called a 51 percent attack, earlier this year.This attack happens when one single malicious miner controls more than 51 percent of the compute power on a blockchain network and can then inject false transactions into the system.In a paper released today, the Horizen team claim to have found an innovative solution – by updating their proof-of-work consensus algorithm with a so-called “delay function” that penalizes miners that could be preparing for such an attack. Horizen is a fork of privacy-oriented crypto zcash, which is itself a fork of bitcoin.Because a 51 percent attack requires a miner to produce blocks in secret before posting them to the blockchain, co-founder of Horizen Rob Viglione said a delay function allows for penalties that make such attacks prohibitively expensive.“So what it does is essentially it poses a massive cost, a 10x cost, on trying to launch one of these attacks,” he told CoinDesk.Stepping back, the 51 percent attack has been a part of many crypto enthusiast’s awareness this year, after five major cryptocurrencies lost money due to the attack in June.Because they damage the confidence in the security of cryptocurrencies more broadly, Viglione described such attacks as a “negative externality on the entire industry.”And with direct insight into the attack – the 51 percent attack on Horizen resulted in 36 fake blocks being included in the blockchain – Viglione said:“Right after the attack our engineers started brainstorming and we think we have a very elegant, simple solution to make sure that this doesn’t happen again.”He continued, “Technically, to make it costly if it were ever to happen again.”To do this, Horizen’s new algorithm introduces penalties for delayed blocks – those that are broadcast to the network a long time after the latest block.In effect, the new code release modifies a feature of the underlying consensus algorithm, the so-called “longest chain rule,” with a delay function.For example, if a block is proposed that is 5 blocks or more behind the most recent, a penalty is introduced, Viglione said. That quadratically increases the amount of blocks a miner needs to produce in order to have transactions accepted onto the chain, he continued.As such, the chances of a 51 percent attack are decreased.And because of the nature of Horizen’s architecture, such a penalty should only occur if the miner is malicious, Viglione said.“We have an average block find time of 2 and a half minutes, maximum latency to broadcast anywhere in the world is like one or two seconds, so there’s no way you could be 5 blocks behind legitimately,” he explained.This though, Viglione noted, could cause a network partition to occur on the blockchain, as multiple chains of blocks compete to be recognized as the honest chain. In this case, Viglione said miners will vote to determine which chain is legit.“They essentially elect which chain is legitimate and they start mining on that just like they would any longest chain rule,” Viglione said.Additionally, to prevent such network splits from being permanent, Viglione said that penalties decrease on the accepted chain.“Blocks are added and there’s a negative one decrement to the penalty that was previously assessed, so there’s always a convergence that can happen to prevent the network partition being permanent,” he told CoinDesk.Accompanying the release, a white paper states that should a chain of blocks be rejected due to being too far behind the most recent block, exchanges can freeze suspicious deposits until the situation is resolved.Additionally, Viglione said the specifics of the penalties can be tweaked depending on network conditions.“We can tune and dial up the cost if we ever think it’s insufficient relative to hashrates and all that,” he told CoinDesk.Still, it’s worth noting that such changes have long been the subject of research, and others are skeptical about whether Horizen can achieve its claims.For example, leading ethereum proof-of-stake researcher Vlad Zamfir noted that while he had yet to dig into Horizen’s new code, “the design space doesn’t include miracles.”Additionally, consensus researcher Emin Gur Sirer expressed skepticism, telling CoinDesk, “these protocols are subtle and difficult to get right.”But, following several months of testing, Viglione is confident that the new algorithm works well in practice, and hopes it can set an example for the broader cryptocurrency industry.“We’ve been testing it internally for a little while now, a couple of months, so we’re pretty confident with the code,” Viglione said, adding:“I’d imagine that other projects should, they really should update their code as well.”EDIT (16.20 UTC October 10 2018): This article has been updated to reflect that the victim of Horizen’s June 51 percent attack was a cryptocurrency exchange, not Horizen itself.Cut wire image via Shutterstock"

As such, Binance’s chief financial officer Wei Zhou told CoinDesk:“They [users] just have to have money within the mobile payment system. They don’t have to have bank accounts.”Aside from the local focus, the effort differs from Binance’s flagship global trading platform in at least two other notable ways.While Binance only offers trading of cryptos for other cryptos, its new unit in Uganda is partnering with a local mobile payments provider that will convert fiat to crypto or vice versa. (The partner asked not to be named, due to safety concerns related to managing large quantities of cash.) Unlike its Malta-based parent company, a spokesperson told CoinDesk that Binance Uganda plans to eventually open local bank accounts.“One of the major issues in the region, in the continent, right now is liquidity and Binance will bring us liquidity,” Nairobi-based entrepreneur Marvin Coleby in nearby Kenya, co-trustee of the African Digital Asset Framework, told CoinDesk. “These digital assets can move, borderless, around the continent.”Further, the prospective Ugandan users are still undergoing the know-your-customer (KYC) onboarding process, verifying their government-issued IDs. Binance was historically known for only requiring an email address to trade crypto-to-crypto.Previously, Ugandans who wanted to trade crypto were mostly reliant on peer-to-peer exchanges like LocalBitcoins or nearby services such as the Zimbabwean exchange Golix. However, Kwame Rugunda, chairman of the Uganda Blockchain Association and co-founder of the Ugandan blockchain startup CryptoSavannah, told CoinDesk such platforms hardly represent a “large population in the country that are unbanked” and “hungry” for access to cryptocurrency.Since Binance Uganda opened, Rugunda said, several other global exchanges have started contacting local regulators.“We’ve already heard of interest from other players that are looking at the Ugandan market,” he said.Meanwhile, Zhou told CoinDesk that Binance Uganda is looking to hire local operational staff for both local support and expansion of similar subsidiaries in 2019 to either Kenya, Nigeria, or South Africa.“Uganda is our pivot to reach out to other African markets,” Zhou said.Remittance is a crucial factor driving demand for bitcoin in Uganda, Rugunda said.A 2014 national census revealed nearly 10 percent of Ugandan households received remittance from neighboring Kenya, only a few percentage points below the most popular remittance sources in Europe, Sweden and Germany. But these transfers carry high conversion fees, creating demand for alternatives.“There’s a lot of cost in the financial system when you switch the currencies back and forth, in addition to inflation,” Zhou said, adding:“That tells us that a use case for cryptocurrency in Africa is as a hedge against inflation.”Other factors driving cryptocurrency adoption in Uganda are rampant unemployment beyond the agricultural industry and demand for imported products, Rugunda said.“There’s a large consumer market for people purchasing cars, for example, because bitcoin is legal tender in Japan,” where the cars are manufactured, Rugunda said.Meanwhile, the International Labour Office estimated in 2017 that almost 15 percent of working-age Ugandans under 30 were unemployed, plus nearly 49 percent who were employed only had irregular or temporary work. As such, many are becoming self-employed.“Unemployment is another real factor,” Rugunda added. “It forces people to look outside of formal employment structures.”This harkens to similar factors noted by cryptocurrency advocates in the Palestinian territories, where educated young people look online for opportunities to earn, shop with, and trade crypto when white-collar jobs are scarce.On the other hand, there’s still a long way to go until those 40,000 Binance Uganda users start to rely on bitcoin for daily remittances.BitPesa CEO Elizabeth Rossiello, based in nearby Kenya, told CoinDesk that many Ugandans became skeptical of bitcoin after criminal operations promised Ugandans bitcoin then defrauded them instead.“Uganda is a heavily offline market, where trust is built through face-to-face interactions,” Rossiello said. “We are very hopeful in regards to regulation and government support, as they have been recently very open to new blockchain events and innovations.”In his dealings with local authorities, Rugunda said he’s seen an increasing openness to the cryptocurrency industry, including the establishment of a National Taskforce for Blockchain. In fact, Ugandan royal Prince Kudra Kalema is currently spearheading an energy project with the crypto startup Wala, which already has thousands of Ugandan mobile app users.Zhou agreed Uganda is “an up-and-coming African country” with a relatively crypto-friendly and stable political system. Speaking to the high demand for fiat liquidity and affordable cross-border crypto transactions, he concluded:“For Africa as a whole, this is just step one for Binance to serve Africa.”Uganda image via ShutterstockCorrection: This article has been updated to note that Binance Uganda plans to work with local banks."

Like with most indicators though, money is made by understanding how to use the indicator rather than how it works, but it’s worth explaining the inner workings of the MACD so you get an idea why it is such a beloved indicator.There are three main components to the MACD indicator: the MACD line (blue oscillator), the signal line (orange oscillator) and the histogram. The explanation may be hard to wrap your head around, but the MACD is one of the easiest indicators to use because of how simply it’s data is visually represented.When the MACD crosses above the signal line, it is known as a bullish cross and when it crosses below, its known as a bearish cross. The crosses indicate a shift in trend momentum and represent buy or sell signals depending on the type of cross. BTC/USD Daily ChartAs can be seen, MACD crosses tend to provide confirmation of a trend change, at least in the short term. For example, on November 16, 2017, the MACD line made a bullish cross above the signal line, presenting a buy signal. The MACD stayed above the signal line for over a month when the rice went on to rally more than 150 percent before its next bearish cross. The bear cross occurred on Dec. 20, 2017, which signaled a bullish-to-bearish trend change.It’s recommended to use the MACD in conjunction with other indicators like volume, RSI or price action because like any indicator the MACD is not 100 percent accurate and can give off false signals.For example, the bullish crosses in January and March were relatively flat and failed to stay above the signal line for very long, resulting in short-lived price rallies and poor buy signals. The MACD is great for identifying possible changes in a trend. But it can also identify overbought or oversold market conditions, as we’ll explore below. The conditions are presented when the MACD and signal line separate too far away from both one another as well as the zero line. BTC/USD Weekly ChartAs can be seen, the MACD line began to stray noticeably far away from the signal line in December of 2017. Also at this time, both the MACD and Signal were well above the zero line. The combination of the two warned investors that the surge in price action was causing over-extended market conditions and a pullback was becoming likely. The zero line marks the midpoint of the MACD oscillator. When the 12 EMA crosses above the 26 EMA, the MACD crosses above the zero line, presenting a buy signal. Conversely, when the 12 EMA crosses below the 26 EMA, the MACD crosses below the zero line and presents a sell signal. The histogram (pink bars) quantifies the distance between the MACD and the signal line. The histogram prints a bar above the zero line when the MACD is above the signal line and prints below when the MACD is below the signal line. The size of the bar depends on the how great the distance is between the two lines. As you can see in the above chart, the histogram reaches its highest level when the MACD is at its farthest point above the signal line, implying the rally is becoming overstretched. Once the pullback occurs, the bearish MACD cross and histogram retreating below the zero line cemented the trend in bearish favor.The MACD is a great tool for the trend following traders, whether you’re a beginner or a professional.It depicts buy and sell signals simply by the crossing of two lines, so even the most novice traders can quickly become comfortable with the tool.Disclosure: The author holds BTC, AST, REQ, OMG, FUEL, 1st, and AMP at the time of writing.Digital Graph Chart via Shutterstock"

CEO Ann-Marie Hopkins told CoinDesk that the wallet will allow users to buy some amount of cryptocurrency, such as bitcoin, and ensure that “it’ll be easier to get bitcoin from one person to another.”Bitsy – which has seen investment from Medici Ventures, the blockchain subsidiary of retail giant Overstock.com – says its wallet offers a clean interface for newcomers to the tech, one which hides wallet addresses, transaction verifications and other technical details, though those will still remain accessible for more experienced users.Hopkins explained:“We want the regular bitcoin technical person to appreciate it, but at the same time we want it to be more mainstream, more usable, and until we make it more approachable, we don’t think people will use it.”According to the firm’s website, the product will use facial recognition for wallet access on devices fitted with the technology.To use the new product, users purchase their desired amount of bitcoin in U.S. dollars, and the crypto “goes right into your wallet,” according to Hopkins. To transfer bitcoin to someone else, the wallet defaults to a QR code instead of a bitcoin address.“If you don’t want to worry about the technical stuff, you don’t have to. Of course, you have access if you want to look at the verifications,” she added.At launch, users will be able to transfer funds chiefly between individuals. However, the company intends for its platform to act as an on-ramp for those looking to purchase goods or services online, as well.“That’s eventually, probably where we’re going. That’s the ideal, companies all get a wallet, you send them the bitcoin, they charge you the bitcoin, it can just be another form of payment,” the CEO said.To kick start that expansion, Overstock.com will add an integration for the wallet in late 2018 or early 2019, which will enable customers to quickly purchase items for sale on its platform using cryptocurrency. Ultimately, Overstock.com customers will even be able to directly purchase bitcoin through the app.Moreover, while users in developed nations may already have options to purchase and transact with bitcoin, those who have difficulty accessing banking services may be able to more easily conduct transactions using Bitsy, Hopkins said.Bitcoin wallet image via Shutterstock"

A link posted to the tweet directs to a giveaway site (which CoinDesk is not linking), prompting users to “sеnd frоm 0.2 to 5 BTC tо the address bеlow and gеt frоm 1 to 100 ВTC back!”The news triggered an outcry from users who saw the tweet, renewing scrutiny of the social media platform’s anti-scam practices.The incident is notable given that it involved a verified account but also that the scam information was circulated by way of a promoted tweet. Promoted tweets are paid for and are generally used by advertisers to reach a wider audience than they normally would through their existing network of followers, taking advantage of search trends (in this case, the public interest around the controversial Tesla CEO) to boost performance and visibility.Twitter has long faced criticism for the prevalence of giveaway scams. Indeed, Elon Musk’s identity has been used in the past by other would-be scammers hoping to parlay Musk’s popularity in order to trick users into thinking that he is, in fact, giving away cryptocurrency.In August, a group of researchers published evidence of a massive botnet fueling crypto scams on Twitter, utilizing fake accounts to give the appearance that real people were interacting with the giveaway organizers.It’s an issue that Musk himself is fully aware of, having posted about the issue last month. At the time, he sought help from crypto-community members, including dogecoin creator Jackson Palmer, in an effort to block the scam solicitations from his feed.Twitter did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Editorial credit: Pe3k / Shutterstock.com"

Authorities were also probing whether the same hackers were behind the January hack of the Coincheck exchange, which saw over $500 million in cryptocurrency taken – though Lazarus wasn’t specifically mentioned.More generally, Group-IB also indicates that $882 million in cryptocurrency was stolen from exchanges in total from 2017 to 2018, according to a summary of the report obtained by the tech news source.The security provider said the number of attacks targeting crypto exchanges is likely to rise further, with hackers of more traditional financial institutions such as banks being drawn to the space seeking big gains.The summary also looks at the methods used by hackers in order to carry out their attacks, saying spear phishing, social engineering and malware are the most widespread tools of the illicit trade.TNW cited the report as saying that spear phishing – targeting individuals or organizations with malware delivered via an email attachment – is the “major vector of attack” on enterprise networks. It adds:“After the local network is successfully compromised, the hackers browse the local network to find work stations and servers used working with private cryptocurrency wallets.”Furthermore, says Group-IB, hackers have made off with 10 percent of the funds raised by ICO platforms since early 2017, with phishing the most common means of attack.The firm reportedly suggests that over-keen investors have been rushing to participate in token sales without paying sufficient attention to their security, often falling foul of tricks such as fake websites. For example, one such fake targeted would-be investors in the major ICO launched by Telegram, as reported in March.Group-IB further warns that mining pools could prove a tempting target for hackers, saying bad actors could employ 51 percent attacks to take over networks, as has happened at a number of crypto projects this year.Hacking image via Shutterstock"

SMA (white line) for bitcoin responded to a sharp move up in price ...","Sep 9, 2018 at 11:00 UTC",New to crypto trading? Read CoinDesk’s full set of guides.,"If simple moving averages are your game as a crypto-trader, it’s time to take it to the next level for this week’s Crypto 101 guide. Last time, we discussed simple moving averages (SMAs), and in this segment, we will look at a strategy utilized by the moving-average elite – the “crossover”. By now you should have learned how moving averages function, their specific purpose and the strategy used to determine if the trend is actually at an end or about to make a reversal. If not, then you should take some more time to study,  getting to know the various ins and outs of SMA’s on different time frames.Moving on, the SMAs we discussed previously tend to move in relation to a set of data over a specified period of time, plotting a line on the chart that illustrates whether or not a trend is bearish or bullish – as well as the momentum behind certain price moves.A moving average crossover occurs when two or more moving averages cross paths, confirming a shift in the market trend. They happen when large shifts in price action become manifest, pushing the lines up or down and, thus, causing them to cross.You can see these events in action through the image below:In the example, there are two simple moving averages (SMA’s) “crossing over” on multiple occasions, whereby the faster SMA (21-period) passed over or under the slower one (55-period), thus confirming a bullish or bearish signal.In the first example on the chart (left to right), we see how the 21-period SMA (white line) for bitcoin responded to a sharp move up in price crossing paths with the 55-period SMA (red line) from underneath.From there, it maintained its position below the candlesticks and above the 55-period SMA until they met again two weeks later.(Click here to learn why the two Fibonacci numbers were chosen.)Notice in the second example how the candlesticks pass below the lines after crossing, confirming the price has turned bearish and that it is a good time to exit long positions.This bearish trend lasted almost a month, from August 1 to August 23, during which time they met once more (example 3.), forming a weak bullish signal. In order to spot the confirmation, in this case, a helpful tip would be to wait until the lines have parted far enough to your satisfaction, as this demonstrates a movement away from bearish conditions.That brings us fourteen days ahead to example 4 on the chart when the lines crossed bearish, confirming the $1000 drop in price as a greater bearish move. The lines will remain that way until another crossover occurs and the faster SMA pushes up above the slower one in the never-ending cycle.The bottom line is that there are many different variations of crossovers, from the stochastic oscillator to the MACD indicator. As well, there are different types of moving averages – simple, smoothed and exponential – that can work for you depending on the time-frame and asset.These can be useful tools in your arsenal to equip you with a better understanding of the current trend, momentum in price action and whether or not to enter or exit a particular position. While there are complex terminologies like ‘golden cross’, ‘silver cross’ and ‘death cross’ hovering around out there on the fringes of this narrative, it is best for now that you start familiarizing yourself with the basics in your journey to becoming a crossover master.The critics of the moving average crossover strategy often point out that it is a “lagging indicator,” meaning it lags price or happens after a certain price move has appeared.This line of reasoning has merit. Moving averages consider historical data and, hence, the longer the period of the moving average, the more it tends to fall behind price.For instance, the much-feared “death cross” or the bearish crossover between the 50-day SMA and 200-day SMA is considered by many as a “contrarian indicator,” meaning that by the time the positive crossover is confirmed, a major part of the rally has already happened, leaving the market vulnerable to profit-taking.On similar lines, the”death cross” or the bearish crossover between the 50-day SMA and 200-day SMA is a big-time lagging indicator and often works the other way around.However, that does not mean we should exclude MA crossover from the market analysis arsenal. The idea is to focus on the short-term crossovers for trend confirmation. For instance, the 5-day and 10-day MA crossover strategy is widely used for short-term trading.Meanwhile, the long-term MAs – 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day – tend to serve well as key support and resistance levels.As always, using MA crossover along with basic price chart analysis and indicators like RSI will improve the accuracy of market analyses.Disclosure: The author holds USDT at the time of writing.Crossing tracks image via Shutterstock"

While recent successes include waffle recipes, romantic fiction and crypto punditry, berniesanders gets a pretty steady paycheck (about $30 at a time) for his single sentence, self-described “shit posts.”A recent sampling: “Are you having fun? I’m having fun.” ($60), “I’m on a boat!” ($31), “Show me your shoes.” ($30) and “How many comments can a shit post get?” ($263 and 319 comments).But for a few hours on September 17, the Steemit community was deprived of berniesanders’ wisdom.On that day, Steemit became unavailable when Steem suffered an outage and stopped adding new blocks. The blockchain and the apps on top of it had gone dark.Steem’s outage, the company explained, was related to an upcoming hard fork update. The code for the fork was being run by some nodes in advance, and as such, these nodes split off onto an incompatible chain when certain safeguards failed. The nodes accidentally hard forked the network early, and as a result, the nodes couldn’t come to consensus on new blocks.“The blockchain was the piece that was halted in this case,” Ned Scott, the founder and CEO of Steemit, told CoinDesk. “But it caused a ripple effect, a domino effect on all the apps built on top.”For the Steem blockchain, that’s 400 applications, according to Scott.And several of those applications likely had confused, worried and sometimes angry users wondering why they couldn’t interact with their favorite blockchain-based tools. Case in point, once the Steemit network began functioning normally again, berniesanders returned with a post tagged “testingshitsteem,” “amateurshitdevs” and “deadchain.”That’s perhaps a bit harsh.Sure enough, other users weren’t quite so critical. A Steemit user going by “alphasteem” (she of the waffle recipes) said:“I guess that’s the way things work with new technology.”The only problem is, that’s not how things are supposed to work with this particular piece of new technology. One of the most frequently cited advantages of blockchain networks is that they suffer zero downtime – or close to it.For example, there’s a website dedicated to tracking bitcoin’s uptime since its launch in January 2009: 99.992559576 percent, at the time of writing. And the Ethereum Foundation describes the network’s applications as running “exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third-party interference.”In recent months, though, major blockchain networks have seen downtime, and the trend has some people wondering, WTF?The incident on the Steem network is not the only recent example of a blockchain going down (in fact, it’s not the only time Steem has gone down in recent months).In March, Neo’s blockchain was temporarily halted. This can happen, the project’s senior research and development manager Malcolm Lerider initially explained, “when a consensus node gets disconnected during the consensus.”In response to pointed criticism – to the effect that, if just one of only seven consensus nodes on the Neo network can pause the chain by going offline, Neo is highly vulnerable – Lerider stepped that response back a bit. He said Neo could handle the loss of a consensus node, and that the circumstances leading to the incident were more complicated.A few months later, the EOS blockchain also saw the production of new blocks halted for nearly five hours.According to Thomas Cox, who at that time was the vice president of product at Block.One, the company behind the EOS protocol (he’s since left the company), the deferred transactions weren’t being checked correctly, which led to a “weird state” and “prevented further blocks from being created.”This incident occurred just a couple of days after the EOS network went live in June.These examples raise the question of why, nearly a decade into the existence of blockchains, the promise of zero downtime is starting to show cracks.The answer may have to do with the emergence of new ways of achieving consensus: the process by which all the participants in a blockchain system come to agreement on the state of the network.In bitcoin, ethereum and other proof-of-work (PoW) systems, the way consensus is achieved makes it extremely unlikely that a network will come to a halt – even if a high number of nodes drop off.Speaking to this, Riccardo Spagni, project lead at monero (a proof-of-work cryptocurrency), told CoinDesk:“PoW can handle things like the network partitioning and coming back together after some time. It’s incredibly robust.”In contrast, a newer method – versions of which Neo, EOS and Steem all employ – designates a certain set of specialized nodes to determine the state of the network. Rather than “mining,” these nodes come to agreement through quicker and less energy-intensive processes, enabling faster and cheaper transactions than bitcoin or ethereum.These systems are broadly known as federated or delegated protocols, with more specific labels applying based on the exact cryptographic methods involved: delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance (dBFT) for Neo and delegated proof-of -stake (DPoS) for EOS and Steem.Neo’s Lerider disputed the idea that federated blockchains are more susceptible to downtime in general. “Different consensus algorithms may be used in a federated chain,” he told CoinDesk, and “to know which ones that have potential to go down,” it’s necessary to look at the specific implementation.Broadly, though, delegated consensus has brought something new to cryptocurrency: the potential to scale enough to accommodate use cases that only centralized providers were previously able to handle. For instance, Steem and EOS can support millions of transactions per day, according to the website Block’tivity.Yet, at the same time, these new protocols have reintroduced a foible of centralized providers to the world of blockchain: downtime. When key nodes in a federated system go down or fall out of sync, the entire network can grind to a halt.That’s not to say these systems are necessarily inferior to traditional proof-of-work, however.There is an important tradeoff at work, according to Eric Wall, blockchain and cryptocurrency lead at the Swedish fintech firm Cinnober.“All distributed systems are fundamentally limited by the CAP theorem,” he told CoinDesk.According to this theorem, which is often cited in discussions of blockchain networks, a given system can only optimize for two of three characteristics: consistency, availability and partition tolerance (hence the acronym “CAP”).Although, in reality, the range of choices is narrower. Partition tolerance – the ability to run a blockchain over a network that loses some messages, as the internet does – is “non-negotiable,” said Wall. So engineers can either favor accessibility, as in bitcoin and ethereum; or favor consistency, as in EOS, Steem and Neo.Wall described what these options look like in practical terms, saying, “Many federated systems will simply halt in contingency situations, often requiring manual intervention to start running again. Bitcoin, on the other hand, will typically not halt, but instead bitcoin forks into two blockchains for a short period of time a couple of times a month.”In other words, from the user’s perspective, the bitcoin network may never go down, but there’s no guarantee that a user hasn’t found themselves on a fork that will eventually be abandoned in favor of a canonical chain.Most of the time, Wall continued, bitcoin’s lack of consistency isn’t a big deal. The network “does have eventual consistency,” he said, “which comes from the fact that the forks resolve themselves automatically after a short while.”He added, “So while Bitcoin is not a true CAP system, it’s practically as good as one.”Then again, certain incidents have shown that favoring availability over consistency can get blockchains into trouble. Steemit’s Scott pointed to an incident in March 2013, when bitcoin forked in what Vitalik Buterin – then a journalist – called “one of the most serious hiccups that we have seen in the past four years.”Echoing that, Wall suggested that such incidents may be an argument for consistency-favoring “CP” systems over accessibility-favoring “AP” ones:“Two conflicting forks are a much bigger danger to the network than a single halted one.”What might seem notable here, though, is that bitcoin hasn’t suffered a similar incident since 2013, while younger networks continue to experience “hiccups.”“The reason why these bugs have been more prevalent in federated systems than in PoW-based systems recently boils down to the fact that the Bitcoin codebase is more battle-tested, more stringently vetted and of superior quality than its federated counterparts,” Wall said.Indeed, when the oldest dPOS blockchain, Bitshares, launched in 2015, bitcoin had already been live for more than six years.But the younger networks might well catch up. “Steem is now a very battle-hardened blockchain,” Scott said following the recent outage.“I don’t look back and say there weren’t bumps in the road,” he continued. “I look at those bumps and bruises as testament to our strength and resilience and our drive for innovation.”Steem still plans to go ahead with the planned hard fork update – its 20th – on September 25.It is also notable that, grizzled veteran though it may be, bitcoin narrowly avoided terrible consequences from a severe bug discovered this week, which could potentially have taken down large swathes of the network for a relatively low cost.Speaking to this, Zooko Wilcox, founder and CEO of the Zcash company (zcash, like bitcoin, is a proof-of-work cryptocurrency), told CoinDesk that at the end of the day, no network is perfectly safe.He concluded:“There is a risk of software failures taking down any software system, including any blockchain such as Bitcoin, Ethereum or Zcash.”Light image by Artur Matosyan on Unsplash"

The document, titled “Cryptocurrency Anti-Money Laundering 2018 Q3,” indicates the losses are 3.5 times higher than the levels seen in 2017, which came to $266 million. CipherTrace estimates the total figure will reach over $1 billion by the end of 2018.The most notable theft of the year 2018 was the hack of Japanese exchange Coincheck, which saw $530 million-worth of cryptos stolen.Other major breaches included a number of crypto exchanges such as Italy’s BitGrail ($195 million), Japan’s Zaif (around $60 million) and South Korea’s Coinrail (over $40 million) and Bithumb (over $30 million). Other types of businesses hit included token creation platform Bancor ($23.5 million) and Geth, an ethereum client (over $20 million).While the biggest attacks dominated the headlines, the report also cited a steadily growing number of “smaller” thefts in the range of $20 million–$60 million, totaling $166 million since the second quarter report. The report states:“This data indicates a pattern of smaller robberies on a regular basis and sophisticated professional cyber thieves who carry out hacks at both the exchange and platform levels by capitalizing on exposed vulnerabilities, as well as by socially engineering employees who work at these companies.”Some other hacks such as the CoinHoarder phishing thefts, estimated at $50 million, were excluded from the report, CipherTrace said, adding that it will include them in the 2018 annual report if the figures can be confirmed. The firm also said that it is aware of an over $60 million hack, which has not been reported publicly.CipherTrace further revealed that 97 percent of the direct bitcoin payments from criminals went to exchanges in countries with weak anti-money laundering (AML) laws, and that the exchanges have laundered a significant amount of bitcoin, totaling 380,000 BTC or $2.5 billion at current prices. Some governments around the world have taken stricter measures to curb the thefts, the report said, while many other governments are expected to come up with tighter cryptocurrency AML regulations by the end of this year. Dave Jevans, CEO of CipherTrace, said in a press release: “Different geographies are competing on regulations and trying to become ‘trusted’ digital currency hubs in order to grow their economies. We will see the opportunities to launder cryptocurrencies greatly reduced in the coming 18 months as cryptocurrency AML regulations are rolled out globally.”Earlier today, CoinDesk reported that Tech Bureau, the firm behind Zaif, has revealed a new plan to compensate users after a major hack last month that would see it taken over by another crypto exchange. CoinDesk also previously reported that the Bancor team managed to block the transfer of 2.5 million of its BNT tokens (worth around $10 million), reducing its total loss to $13.5 million.

The fake domain swapped two letters from the original to form “StatConuter”, which can be difficult to spot while scanning for unusual activity, says ESET, adding that the domain had previously been suspended in 2010 for association with abusive behaviour.StatCounter is used by more than two million websites, according to its own figures, and it provides statistics on billions of web hits daily.  The fake account managed to get picked up by a number of sites, although Gate.io seems to have been the only target.The report states that the script targets a specific uniform resource identifier (URI): “myaccount/withdraw/BTC.”“It turns out that among the different cryptocurrency exchanges live at time of writing, only Gate.io has a valid page with this URI. Thus, this exchange seems to be the main target of this attack,” it concludes.The URI is notably used by Gate.io to transfer bitcoin from its own account to an external bitcoin address, according to the report. The hackers’ script automatically replaces a user’s bitcoin address with one belonging to the attackers.As the malicious server generates a new bitcoin address each time a visitor loads the StatConuter script, “it is hard to see how many bitcoins have been transferred to the attackers,” the researchers say.After being notified by ESET about the breach, Gate.io announced Wednesday that it “immediately removed” the StatCounter service from its site, and stressed that the users’ funds are “safe.”CoinMarketCap data indicates that Gate.io is the 38th largest crypto exchange globally by adjusted trading volume.

After that, users can only regain access to their crypto assets via mnemonic phrases – a set of words that can be translated into private keys.Liu said the company has started the pre-order of the hardware with shipments scheduled around early December.The new funding comes after Cobo raised a total of $7 million in a seed round in October and also a pre-A round in December last year, the company said.Mao Shixing image courtesy to Cobo"

Research. News; Learn; Research. Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Oct 17, 2018 at 04:00 UTC","If there’s money to be made in the crypto markets, you can bet traders will be the first on the scene.","Such was the case at least last week, when Coinbase Pro, the cryptocurrency trading platform operated by San Francisco startup Coinbase, announced it would list the cryptocurrency 0x (ZRX), a move that put the “Coinbase effect” on display when ZRX surged nearly 40 percent on the news.That perhaps isn’t so much of a surprise. Coinbase is the largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange by volume, and recently valued at $8 billion because of its millions of users, a common byproduct of new listings is a double-digit price surge.Still, it wasn’t just Coinbase that got a tip off about the listing prior.Data shows prices for ZRX began to surge on other exchanges a few minutes before Coinbase made its official public announcement at 17:00 UTC. But while there were whispers online about the possibility of insider trading, a charge the exchange has denied in the past, there’s another explanation that is perhaps more plausible.Savvy traders may have been simply making use of well-timed trading bots, computer programs that automatically scout technical price charts and exchange APIs to identify actionable and profitable developments. The bots can then either immediately act on their findings by placing a trade, or send a signal to their users in the form of a message via social media.It’s often free to receive the signals, but bots capable of placing trades generally come at a cost.Altcoinnotify, for example, is a bot used only for signals only, and is free on Twitter. On the other hand, more expansive and customizable bots like Cryptohopper, which are capable of placing instantaneous trades based on multiple signals, can cost $20 to $99 per month.If traders would like more control over a bot, they can even program their own. Estimates suggest experienced programmers can put together the code in just a few days, though it remains a matter of expertise to search for the right buy and sell signals.In the case of this particular listing, API bots like Lightingsignal appear to have been designed well enough to read Coinbase Pro’s API and notice that it had added a new cryptocurrency to it’s server. As can be seen in the image below, the bot sent out a signal via Twitter at 16:56 UTC, four minutes before the public announcement.Cryptocurrency trader Johnny Moe explained how such a signal can give a significant advantage, putting them a leg up above traders seeking to place their own bets on exchanges.Moe told CoinDesk:“By the time a manual trader would see the API addition, and navigate the exchange UI, login with 2FA, navigate to the trading page for the coin in question, fill an order entry, etc., the price is already moving up from trading bots having made their purchases.”Yet, in the world of crypto trading bots, it’s unlikely Lightningsignals was the only computer program to convey a timely signal, particularly because even a small informational advantage can yield big results in the crypto markets.Should a trader have acted on the notification from Lightningsignals, it would have allowed them enough time to purchase ZRX at a near 15 percent better price than the casual investor.
As can be seen in the above chart, the price of ZRX/USD began a noticeable increase at 16:56 UTC on the Binance exchange (the time of the signal), rising from $0.68 to $0.77 by the time Coinbase Pro made a public announcement at 17:00 UTC.The price was able to record a 13 percent increase in that four-minute span and ultimately reach a 24-hour peak of $0.91 at 17:09 UTC.If a trader was utilizing Lightningsignals or a similar API bot, he or she would have been able to capture as much as 35 percent profit whereas the public would have had to settle for a more modest 18 percent grain, bringing in nearly half the profit.Still, it’s not exactly clear how widespread the use of bots is, or how many traders may have acted on such signals at the time of the 0x listing. (Coinbase did not respond to requests for comments about the activity).Further, while successfully running a bot can greatly increase a traders’ competitive edge, the process is easier said than done. A cryptocurrency trader known by his handle “Cryptohustle” explained he uses the tools for “market intel,” but that he still prefers other trading options.“These bots are just additional intel for me, I haven’t built any strategies around them,” he said.Other traders argue that something bots can’t do better than humans, at least for now, is fundamental analysis.“I don’t use bots because it is not  necessary for me to find what I want. I look for projects that have a clear roadmap, achievable goals, leadership, and a “what tech/industry am I displacing,” a pseudonymous trader going by the handle ‘TruthraiderHQ’ said. That said, most traders accept that the bots are part of the market, and that, for the continued future, traders will continue to build strategies, some including the bots such as those that tracked the Coinbase announcement.“There is no ‘insider’ info occurring here,” Moe said, concluding:“There is just technical wherewithal to access it. Or really, since there are publicly available feeds that share this information, just the social wherewithal to use it.”Coinbase image via Shutterstock"

The deal was expected to raise US$17 million when finalized, but it is currently unclear if it reached that stage.The pool accounted for 1.1 percent of bitcoin’s hashing power in June of this year, according to data from blockchain.info. At press time, its hashing power is not sufficient to register on the site.BTCC’s crypto exchange business was previously known as BTC China and was one of the longest-running and once top-three trading platforms in the country before regulators effectively banned crypto trading in September 2017. In January of this year, the exchange was acquired by a Hong Kong-based blockchain investment fund, and in July it relaunched with a plan to issue its own tokens.BTCC Pool said in today’s announcement that it believes that crypto assets and the blockchain industry will continue to “develop and improve.”Hong Kong image via Shutterstock "

This in turn harmed  investors, he said in March.In the original complaint, filed in March, Berk claimed that “unsurprisingly, those who had been tipped off [about bitcoin cash’s listing], immediately swamped Coinbase and the GDAX [sic] with buy and sell orders, thinning the liquidity but obtaining BCH at fair prices. The market effect was to unfairly drive up the price of BCH for non-insider traders once BCH came on line at the Coinbase exchange.”In dismissing the suit, Judge Chhabria wrote that “Berk’s complaint does not sufficiently articulate the legal basis for his claims,” and explaining that “a reader of the complaint is thus left wondering what Coinbase should have done differently, or why the rollout of bitcoin cash would have gone more smoothly had Coinbase done whatever Berk thinks is appropriate.”With one exception, all of Berk’s claims were dismissed without prejudice, the judge continued. As a result, Berk and his attorneys now have three weeks to file an amended complaint.This exception revolves around a claim Berk made concerning the Commodity Exchange Act. However, Berk lacks the standing to make this sort of argument, according to Stephen Palley, an attorney with corporate law firm Anderson Kill P.C.“The Court dismissed with prejudice a claim purporting to arise out of the [CEA]. While a private right of action might exist under the CEA, it only arises if there’s a futures contract at issue. Here, there’s no futures contract. The Court says that claims of fraud/manipulation related to spot market virtual currency trades under the CEA can only be asserted by the [Commodity Futures Trading Commission] in an enforcement action and the Plaintiff here isn’t the CFTC,” he explained.Lynda Grant, an attorney for Berk, told CoinDesk via email that she will be filing an updated complaint within the deadline, though she did not provide any further details.“We intend to amend the complaint,” she said.A representative for Coinbase declined to comment on the case.Coinbase’s victory in getting the case (at least temporarily) dismissed came alongside a loss in another motion the exchange filed.In his ruling, Chhabria denied a Coinbase motion to compel arbitration, which sought to force Berk to sit for individual arbitration, rather than continue the case to a potential trial.Coinbase claimed it had the right to compel arbitration according to the User Agreement Berk had to have agreed to when signing up for the exchange. However, a judge dismissed this motion without prejudice (meaning Coinbase can try again after Berk’s amended complaint is filed).Palley said that this particular aspect of the ruling stood out to him, adding “my view of this case is that it tells you something about the Coinbase arbitration clause.”Regardless of the eventual outcome of this case, the ruling on the motion to compel arbitration is likely one that will be referred back to in future suits, Palley said, explaining:“What happened was Coinbase moved to compel arbitration and also to dismiss, and the thing that jumped out at me was that it obviously matters a lot to them, they would prefer not to have cases heard or tried in court, they’d rather have it tried in arbitration, they have an arbitration case … [but] the court denied the motion saying the arbitration clause should only apply to things that are under contract.”Berk’s allegation that Coinbase hurt consumers by allowing market manipulation does not fall under this contract, according to Chhabria.In his ruling, the judge noted that Coinbase’s motion to dismiss did not reference the user agreement, and “assessing whether Coinbase might have engaged in market manipulation or unfair business practices does not require ‘reference to the underlying agreement or interpretation of the parties’ contractual relationship.'”The ruling is significant to how the case may proceed, Palley said. While Coinbase has the option to file another motion to compel arbitration, the amended complaint is likely to move even further away from the user agreement than the original.“A decent lawyer isn’t going to make a losing argument when they’ve already lost on the point before,” he said.As a result, the case may then proceed through the court system.While Palley did not speak to the merits or the claims made in Berk’s suit specifically, he noted that generally, if a lawsuit moves past a motion to dismiss and discovery and is certified as a class action, “in most cases these things settle.”“If you’re a class, if I’m one person and I’ve lost $50 that’s not very much, but if I’m … representing 10 million people and we’ve all lost $10 then that’s $100 million. That’s the advantage of a class action,” he said.Read the full ruling below:ORDER DENYING MOTION TO COM… by on ScribdEditor’s note: This article has been updated for clarity.Gavel image via Shutterstock"

bitcoin trading at $8,602 (compared to about $6,450) and ether at $319 ...","Oct 23, 2018 at 01:07 UTC","Users of the long-troubled cryptocurrency exchange WEX have begun filing police reports after more than three months of being unable to withdraw major cryptocurrencies or fiat, CoinDesk has learned.","A WEX trader named Ruslan, who has been encouraging other users to seek an official investigation, told CoinDesk that as many as 35 such reports have been filed thus far online through the website of the Russian Interior Ministry. Coordinating through a specially created website and a Telegram chat group, users have been sharing confirmation numbers the filing system sent them after their reports were submitted. At least seven such reports CoinDesk was able to confirm against the Interior Ministry’s website.The fact that users of a cryptocurrency exchange that has operated at the fringes of the market would seek help from the government is itself notable. WEX was built on the ashes of BTC-e, the mysterious, long-running exchange that ultimately collapsed after U.S. officials seized its domain and then slapped BTC-e and its suspected operator with a massive $110 million fine.But this summer, the initial enthusiasm around what was effectively a rebirth of BTC-e gave way to growing complaints around withdrawals, which manifested in sky-high prices well beyond those reported on more well-known exchanges. Those issues continue to this day, with the price of USDT – a controversial stablecoin that lost its parity with the U.S. dollar last week – trading for a whopping $6.99 on WEX.As such, WEX traders – after months of demanding answers (WEX’s last public message on Twitter was posted in late August) – are taking matters into their own hands, seeking an investigation in an effort to get their money back. What’s more, recent developments continue to further stoke questions over who is actually running WEX and, by association, who is safeguarding user funds.Ruslan told CoinDesk that he hoped to make law enforcement take measures against WEX’s CEO Dmitri Vasiliev and “his conspirators” to prevent them from initiating any new projects in crypto.“The main idea has been to show other users that they are not alone, that we can act together and fight for our rights by legal means,” he said.Neither WEX’s CEO Dmitrii Vasilev nor WEX’s official Twitter account responded to CoinDesk’s requests for comment for this story.To be sure, users say they’ve been able to withdraw certain coins from WEX since the troubles began – but at a very steep cost.Specifically,  tether (USDT), zcash, namecoin and peercoin have been available for withdrawal. But their prices on WEX are extremely high compared to the rest of the market, so buying them just to get money off the platform is an expensive proposition.Other cryptos also maintain extraordinarily high price tags on WEX, with bitcoin trading at $8,602 (compared to about $6,450) and ether at $319 (versus roughly $204).At some point, around late July, fiat withdrawals were opened but with commissions ranging as high as 45 percent. Even at that price, some users in WEX online chats said they were considering taking their money out, since the longer they waited, the less they trusted the exchange’s management. But now, even this option is no longer available, users have told CoinDesk.It was around that time that it became public that the owner and CEO, Dmitrii Vasilev, was going to sell the exchange to Dmitry Khavchenko, a militia fighter in Eastern Ukraine, according to a report by Russian media service RBC. Withdrawals were frozen in the wake of that report, and Vasilev later told CoinDesk he hadn’t been in control of the exchange and that the administrators weren’t communicating with him. The identities of the exchange’s administrators, as well as those who actually custody user funds, has never been openly disclosed.Khavchenko told CoinDesk last week that the deal was signed and the money passed to the seller. Yet according to the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority of Singapore, where WEX is registered, as of Monday, Vasilev was still listed as the owner.With traders devastated by the situation, trading volume on WEX, once in the tens of millions, has plunged to less than $1 million daily.Frozen bitcoin image via Shutterstock"

Sadly, due to market conditions this did not prove possible at this time, but we will revisit this if and when market conditions are right.”RMG was initially scheduled to launch in the fall of 2017, but the CME partnership failed “at the last minute,” resulting in the Royal Mint no longer having a trading platform to issue tokens on. While the organization tried to find a crypto exchange to partner with instead, the British finance ministry reportedly blocked the move.The RMG token was later scheduled to be issued in spring of 2018, but this again did not work out.RMG was envisioned as a way to manage small amounts of gold, making it easier for investors to enter the market and increase liquidity. The Royal Mint also believed the blockchain platform RMG was based on could be used to track and prove a piece of gold’s provenance, as well as support global trades.Crypto security firm BitGo was tapped to build digital wallets for storing the tokens, while Civic would provide know-your-customer (KYC) services for the project.A request for comment to CME was not immediately returned.Gold image via Shutterstock"

on bitcoin (BTC) – the world's largest cryptocurrency by market ...","Sep 13, 2018 at 18:35 UTC","The cryptocurrency market has been making history for all the wrong reasons as of late, most notably by recently surpassing the plunge of the infamous Dot-Com bubble in the early 2000’s.","With that said, cryptocurrencies tend to make recoveries when all hope is seemingly lost, and today’s price action of the world’s second largest cryptocurrency, ether and many others is no exception. At press time, several of the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization are reporting 24-hour gains above 10 percent, including monero (XMR), litecoin (LTC), and EOS. Ether (ETH) is leading the pack while boasting a 17 percent price increase. Further, the total market cap has edged back up over $200 billion, after falling lower earlier this week.Still, it’s too early to call any type of long-term bullish reversal in the market, but there are three encouraging signs cryptocurrencies may see much-needed relief at least in the short term.Until today, the price of ETH/USD had fallen more than 40 percent since September 5 and 85 percent from its all-time high north of $1,400 set last December. Today though, tells a different story. Since the low of $167.32 yesterday, price has recovered more than 20 percent reaching a 24-high of $207.67, according to data from the Bitfinex Exchange. ETH/USD Daily ChartAs seen in the above chart, the recent price recovery can be attributed to finding support on the lower trend line of a falling wedge, a bullish reversal pattern, in a historical support zone depicted by the green box. Further, the daily RSI was showing bullish divergence, giving all the more reason for a relief rally to occur. In order to provide confirmation of a larger trend reversal, price would need to close a daily, more preferably a weekly, candlestick above wedge resistance with a notable increase in volume. A common method of estimating the breakout target of a falling wedge is to add the base range to the breakout point. Since the base range of this wedge is over $900, a long-term measured objective for price would be in the $1100 area if price were to break out near $230. Many alternative currencies are built on the ethereum blockchain, so a strong recovery from ETH would likely translate to a recovery for others as well. The future prospects for cryptocurrencies in general are heavily dependent on bitcoin (BTC) – the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.Down 70 percent from the record high of $20,000 reached in December, BTC could scare the most seasoned investor. However, a closer look at the long duration technical chart reveals the cryptocurrency is silently charting a major bullish reversal pattern.Weekly chartAs can be seen, BTC’s recovery from the low of $5,859 in August established the first higher low pattern of the year, the previous low being $5,755 hit in June. Further, the recent sell-off ended at $6,119, meaning another higher low has been created.The trendline connecting the higher lows indicates long-term bearish exhaustion. Hence, there is reason to be optimistic as long as prices hold above the trendline.What bulls need now is for BTC to set a higher high by moving above the July high of $8,507. That would confirm a long-term bearish-to-bullish trend change and could yield a sustained rally above $10,000.Risk assets across the globe have picked up a bid in the last 24 hours on reports that the U.S. and China are heading back to the negotiating table.For instance, the AUD/JPY pair, which is widely considered as a risk barometer of global markets, is up 1 percent at press time. Meanwhile, the dollar index is down 0.24 percent.Clearly, investors are hoping that these talks would yield results, however, trade wars would end only if the U.S. officially drops tariffs. More importantly, the past experience suggests such talks tend to break down in a few days. That said, the renewed hopes of the U.S.-China trade talks could keep the risk assets well bid in the short-term. Further, Turkey hiked rates by 625 basis points today to save its stumbling currency and the move has pushed equity markets higher across the globe. All of this will likely bode well for the cryptocurrencies as the investor community still considers bitcoin and other innovations as risk assets.Disclosure: The author holds BTC, AST, REQ, OMG, FUEL, 1st and AMP at the time of writing.Bull-run via Shutterstock; Charts via TradingView"

Rather than serving as vehicles for investment, the tokens are intended to act as a kind of incentive for fans of artists like Young Dirty, allowing them to be spent at shows or on merchandise.The use of blockchain as part of consumer inventive schemes has been explored in the past by numerous companies, including American Express and Singapore Airlines, among others.But the closest analogue is perhaps a loyalty project involving IBM and China UnionPay, which back in 2016 unveiled a proof-of-concept that sought to make incentive points freely tradeable between users. It’s that sort of commodification that the ODBCoin’s creators are betting would be adopted – and indeed, embraced – by an artist’s fanbase.“It’s a great way to connect with fans and reward them for their interest. I look forward to delivering even more music that would make Dad proud,” Young Dirty explained.Ultimately, the goal is for ODBCoin to pave the way for other artists to create similar tokens, with Weiner saying, “We will be announcing our next project at the conclusion of this sale.”“We are quite proud of the response from the music industry and we look forward becoming home to the biggest names in music,” Weiner told CoinDesk.Young Dirty image via Facebook"

Casey is the chairman of CoinDesk’s advisory board and a senior advisor for blockchain research at MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative.,"The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers.The term “institutional crypto” sounds like an oxymoron. There’s something quite ironic about financial institutions adopting a renegade technology that was designed to do away with them.Yet a string of developments this past month suggests that – to put it bluntly – the institutions are coming for your crypto.Whether this is something to be alarmed, excited or bemused by, depends on what you want out of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. Do you want fully independent control over your assets, a more efficient and inclusive global economy, or just to get insanely rich?What is clear is that, for a time at least, there will be an awkward and increasingly intensified clash of cultures between the pinstripes of Wall Street and the hodlers of crypto land.And while an influx of institutional money may at some point drive up crypto prices, that clash portends more uncertainty and volatility for at least a while longer.An important development came with the news two weeks ago that Fidelity will offer a digital asset trading service. The sixth-biggest fund manager in the world announced a project catering specifically to the trading demands of large institutional investors in which, most importantly, they will provide services such as “institutional-grade custody.”For believers in the “be your own bank” philosophy of bitcoin, the very idea of third-party custody is contradictory to the “trustless” ideals of cryptocurrency’s origins.But this was inevitable. If corporations – banks, hedge funds and brokerages, first, then non-financial enterprises, second – are to participate in the crypto economy, the legal, compliance, insurance and risk management demands they live under almost require that they pass off the risk of holding such assets to outside custodians.And let’s face it, an increasing amount of the world’s crypto holdings is in the custody of third-party operators, whether it’s with custodial wallet providers such as Coinbase or at centralized crypto exchanges that comingle customer assets with those of others.A key difference is that these kinds of services are now being developed for hedge funds and other professional investment firms by more heavily regulated firms such as Fidelity. Custodial banks such as State Street and Northern Trust are also working on delivering similar services.At the same time, a number of providers that started as crypto companies have earned regulatory status as qualified custodians, allowing them to also go after compliance-sensitive institutional investors as clients. These include BitGo, which received a charter from the South Dakota Division of Banking in September and Coinbase, which only last week received a similar qualification from the New York Department of Financial Services.Meanwhile, the Intercontinental Exchange, or ICE, which owns the New York Stock Exchange, is preparing to launch Bakkt, a new bitcoin futures trading service – likely in December, the company said last week. The key difference with the futures contracts that were launched late last year by both the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of Options Exchange, is that Bakkt’s will be for physical delivery rather than merely a cash-based settlement. That will, in turn, require custodial and other services.This race to serve institutions comes as the mania for initial coin offerings, or ICOs, has waned on account of the dramatic downturn in the prices of tokens attached to decentralized applications. That was in turn mostly due to a regulatory pushback from the Securities and Exchange Commission, after commissioners argued that most, if not all, ICOs were in breach of securities registration rules.Now, a new buzzword is emerging in the ICO’s place: the “STO.”This is the idea of a security token offering. In many respects, it is far less revolutionary than an ICO. Most ICOs purport to be selling “utility tokens” whose governance structure includes a unique cryptoeconomic model for rewarding and incentivizing certain behavior within decentralized networks. STOs, by contrast, are a crypto-based version of more traditional assets such as bonds or equity.Still, R3, the distributed ledger technology consortium founded by large banks, is already calling security tokens the “third blockchain revolution.”It’s perhaps a little ironic that a group founded by Wall Street firms, which scoffed at the absurd hype in the ICO market last year, is now using language that could also be deemed hyperbolic. Still, it’s true that STOs could have a big impact, especially in terms of smart contracts helping to more efficiently manage cap tables and, potentially, bypass underwriters in a more direct issuer-to-investor model.To be clear, though, the impact will mostly be felt by traditional investment firms and other accredited investors who participate in primary securities markets. It might make it cheaper to raise capital and open up new models for doing so with institutional investors.But it’s not really about democratizing finance, as the ICO phenomenon, with its direct reach into retail markets, was purported to be.There’s a pattern to all this: new custodial and trading services being offered by large, regulated entities, all in preparation for an expected influx of new securities that use smart contracts and blockchain technology to manage transfers of more traditional assets. All are aimed squarely at the expected arrival of institutional investors into the crypto world.Holders of bitcoin, ether and other crypto assets that might now receive a flood of incoming orders from these deep-pocketed investors sometimes salivate at this idea – essentially because they expect prices to rise.That might be the case, but this is not going to be a smooth ride.One reason is that, for all the efforts to jam the square peg of cryptocurrencies into the round hole of regulated, intermediary-managed capital markets, there is a fundamental contradiction that won’t be easy to reconcile.Wall Street types like to talk about crypto as a new asset class, one to add next to stocks, bonds and commodities in their clients’ portfolios. But for the time being at least, while early-adopting retail players of varying size still dominate the crypto community, this “asset class,” if it can be called that, is going to behave in a very different way from others.That’s because, for now at least, when you buy bitcoin, ether or other pure cryptocurrencies, you’re not just buying a piece of real estate or a claim on a company’s equity, you’re buying into an idea.And that idea, one that’s supported by a very motivated, enthusiastic—if not always rational – community, supports a paradigm that would see these very same intermediating institutions removed from the economy.I feel Wall Street analysts are going to have a hard time grappling with that contradiction. There will be a lot of surprises. And surprises create volatility.Making a deal image via Shutterstock."

Together with Socios.com, we believe we can offer new opportunities to our worldwide fan base to engage in cutting-edge way with their favorite club.”The announcement comes amid a recent spate of soccer clubs turning to blockchain tech to try and engage further with their fan-bases.Just two weeks ago, top French league team Paris Saint-Germain, revealed plans to issue its own cryptocurrency as a way to incentivize participation from its fans around the world. That project is also being conducted in partnership with Socios via a similar Fan Token Offering.In fact, Socios indicated in today’s release that it hopes to engage with more soccer clubs, possibly as many as 50, going forward.“Our ambition is to build the world’s biggest global football community and marketplace for football fans alongside demonstrating that blockchain and cryptocurrency is the trusted technology of the mainstream,” said Alexandre Dreyfus, the firm’s CEO and founder.Brazi’s Avaí Futebol Clube, a Series B soccer team, announced Sept. 12 that it is creating a cryptocurrency as part of an effort to develop a digital ecosystem for its fans and raise $20 million. The project is aimed to help it develop in order to qualify for the top Series A tier of Brazilian soccer and to build up the team’s physical infrastructure.Cristiano Ronaldo image via Shutterstock"

The vice principal was given a warning. While no institution is likely to allow employees to use their facilities or power to mine cryptos, that hasn’t stopped some from trying.Back in March, a state employee at Florida’s Department of Citrus was arrested for allegedly using official computers to mine cryptocurrencies. At the same time, Louisiana’s attorney general was investigating a group of former staffers for the same offence.And last year, a former employee of the Federal Reserve Board of Directors was fined $5,000 and put on probation after being caught mining bitcoin on a server owned by the U.S. central bank.Mining farm image via Shutterstock "

The results of that effort can be seen in the photo below:In a follow-up post, benevolinsolence revealed an update to the costume complete with glowsticks for the occasion.Even industry startups like Blockstream got into the Halloween spirit with some in-office costumes.Keeping in the spirit of the double-holiday, journalist Laura Shin dressed up as the bitcoin white paper itself.This group of revelers offered a unique take on the term “bitcoin miners,” including both a hard hate and a live-price ticker for bitcoin. As a subsequent tweet revealed, the group won first place in a costume contest.Some costume-wearers took on the topic of cryptocurrency forks (with an emphasis on the breakaway cryptocurrency bitcoin cash) this Halloween.All in all, the crypto community put its creative spirit to the test this Halloween.

It has also set up a task force to foster cryptocurrency commerce.There have also been moves within the EU to develop new rules for cryptos, with one lawmaker also proposing standards for ICOs that would allow token sale projects to operate across the economic zone.Joseph Muscat image via UN/YouTube"

FINMA said it advises banks and securities dealers to assign a “flat risk weight of 800% to cover market and credit risks” against crypto assets. That means, for instance, if the current price of bitcoin is $6,000, institutions would have to value each coin on their books at $48,000 when deciding on an adequate level of buffer.The guidance is on the high end of the range and on the level of hedge funds, according to the report, meaning FINMA considers crypto assets to be volatile.Swissinfo.ch reports that FINMA has also set a crypto-trading cap at 4 percent of a bank’s total capital, and said they must report to the authority if they reach that upper limit.While the letter offers insight into the regulator’s stance and outreach on this issue, it hasn’t yet released official rules for how Swiss banks should deal with cryptocurrencies under the Basel III international banking regulations, according to the report.Back in February, FINMA did issue official guidance for initial coin offerings (ICOS) after receiving a large number of enquiries on the issue.The regulator said at the time that it would determine the applicability of regulation to crypto tokens on a case-by-case basis, taking a similar stance to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in its guidance, released last July.In particular, the agency said it regards “asset tokens” as securities, which means that there are securities and civil law requirements for trading such tokens.  “Payment tokens” and “utility tokens” were unlikely to sit in the securities category, FINMA said.Swiss flags image via Shutterstock "

To the newly crypto initiated, however, it can often be a dangerous game as consolidation periods generally breakout/down hard and fast, leaving many short/long positions in the dust.This is especially true if you are a high-risk taker that continues to “all-in” on your favourite coin without first assessing the direction of grand-daddy bitcoin and the fundamentals affecting the market. It’s always best to wait for confirmation in a change of direction or trend to reduce the risk of being caught on the other side of the fence with your pants down. Often times, inexperienced traders will sit on their investments long-term after a big move, believing that the price will go back up.  However, it’s paramount you observe the overall trend before deciding on a reasonable entry/exit.As we can see on the weekly chart the breakdown from Dec. highs flung the cryptomarket into the jaws of the big sleeping bear and has remained a bloody mess for 9-months. This choice often leads into the stubborn investor “HODL” mindset, whereby traders refuse to sell the given asset based on their belief that price will rise back to the level they bought in just so they can ultimately exit the market altogether.But waiting on a recovery could take years, with some having tied up the majority of their personal liquidity in crypto – the situation would look fairly dire.It’s possible that the majority of new traders seen toward the end of 2017 are just itching to exit the market based around that particular strategy and certain price levels in hopes of coming out of the whole ordeal cost neutral but there is merit for the “HODL” strategy.Provided you don’t check your Blockfolio every hour of the day. If you bought bitcoin at $10,000 why do you care what the price is today? That, of course, depends upon your risk appetite, trust in the asset and whether or not you’re happy to wait out another possible year of bearish conditions with your “loose change” locked up in crypto.Which brings us to the last strategy new traders forget to embrace; reducing your risk of exposure in the market.This can be achieved simply by limiting the total amount of coins you buy at each juncture/period and the variety of coins you decide to stock in your bags.As mentioned above, too often is the case that new traders will decide to “all in” on their favorite crypto as all this really achieves is increasing your exposure to market fluctuations and volatility.So don’t be the guy that puts all his eggs in one basket or you’ll get burnt.On a side note, it is worth being wary of the amount of disinformation out there as noted by Anthony Pompilano who demonstrated the case by posting a tweet that possessed bullish sentiment at the expense of inaccurate information, thereby accruing large activity on the tweet, while duping many in the process. The experiment showed that the dissemination of misinformation is generally linked to opportunistic agendas, so it pays to do-your-own-research (DYOR).Disclosure: The author holds USDT at the time of writing.Businessmen on chart image via Shutterstock; charts by Trading View "

However, the report did not state clearly whether that comment was referring to Beijing Bitmain Technology or the holding company.Various media reports have subsequently cited the news and alleged that Wu is no longer at the board of the holding company and hence has no voting power on the firm’s management.Based on a Chinese business registration database, Beijing Bitmain Technology did record board changes on Nov. 7.Responding to a CoinDesk enquiry, however, a Bitmain representative said the board change was solely at the subsidiary company. Regarding BitMain Technologies Holding Company, the representative said: “To be clear, there is no change in the board structure there.”The structure reshuffle at the Beijing subsidiary shows that Ketuan “Micree” Zhan, who previously served as the chairman of the board, has now become an executive director of the subsidiary.At the same time, Wu’s role has changed from board director to supervisor, while other directors including Zhaofeng Zhao and Yuesheng Ge are no longer on the list of board directors, as per the database.The company further stated in an email response:“As is standard listing practice, Bitmain is restructuring its board and group structure, to ensure it meets regulatory requirements on its road to IPO. This is to simplify the board structure to facilitate its management. There have been no board departures and co-founder Jihan Wu will continue to lead the company as co-chair, together with co-chief executive officer, Micree Zhan.”Based on Bitmain’s draft IPO prospectus, there are currently seven members of the holding company board. Zhan and Wu both serve as co-founder, executive director, co-chairman and co-chief executive officer. Ge and Luyao Liu both serve as executive directors.The board also includes three independent non-executive directors, not affiliated to the holding company. The listing rules and guidance provided by the HKEX requires that any IPO issuer “must appoint independent non-executive directors representing at least one-third of the board.”Based on Bitmain’s draft IPO prospectus, for now, both Zhan and Wu seem to be far from losing any voting power, as claimed in some reports. The holding company adopted weighted voting rights (WVR) – a dual-share structure – after WVR was given the green light by the HKEX in April following a years-long debate on the issue.The prospectus stated Bitmain’s share capital comprises Class A and Class B shares, adding:“Each Class A share entities the holder to exercise one vote, and each Class B share entitles the holder to exercise ten votes, respectively, on any resolution tabled at our Company’s general meetings, except for resolutions with respect to a limited number of Reserved Matters, in relation to which each share is entitled to one vote.”Currently, Zhan and Wu hold about 3.9 billion and 2.2 billion Class B shares, respectively, although the firm has yet to indicate what percentages those amounts represent of the company’s entire Class B share ownership.The HKEX had long adhered to a “one share, one vote” approach, a policy that prompted Chinese internet giant Alibaba to choose the New York Stock Exchange over Hong Kong when it went public in 2014.The Hong Kong exchange later altered the rule in a bid to attract more technology startups, as the dual-share structure is popular among major international tech firms such as Facebook and Google.BitMain is the fourth company to have adopted the WVR approach for an IPO since the HKEX changed the rule in April.Jihan Wu image via CoinDesk"

During this attack, a miner takes over more than half of a cryptocurrency’s mining power, which then allows them to erase a past transaction and replace it with another transaction – called a double spend.While the ecosystem that’s been built up around bitcoin and other top-tier cryptos make them resistant to these kinds of attacks, other cryptocurrencies with less of a community of miners aren’t as secure.Sure enough, on smaller coins, these kinds of attacks are getting more common. In a new report, Group-1B found $20 million worth of crypto theft accomplished with such attacks in 2018, as TNW reported.On Saturday, October 13, geocold51 decided to display just how easy it was – livestreaming his attempt to 51% attack Bitcoin Private, a crypto with close to a $47 million market cap (at the time of writing).Speaking to CoinDesk, geocold51 said, if a cryptocurrency can be so easily attacked, “it’s sort of a misvalue of a given currency by different investors.”Geocold51 estimates he spent $100 to get to the point where he could have done a demonstration double spend on bitcoin private, but he stopped because his livestream got pulled.Just to be clear, geocold51 wasn’t interested in stealing, and so he set up the demonstration where he’d send the bitcoin private he owned to two different wallets he owned. In that way, no user or exchange provider gets ripped off.For him, it’s about displaying that many coins are vulnerable and, therefore, perhaps vastly over-valued.That said, he estimates that to make a profit off a 51% attack, it would cost a malicious attacker roughly double – so around $200 – to buy some bitcoin on an exchange with his bitcoin private and then make another transaction on the longer chain that invalidates the first transaction, giving him his bitcoin private coins back and leaving the exchange coming up short.While going through the exchange process costs more, the 51% attack has still become quite economical due to the rise of cloud computing. According to geocold51, without access to cloud mining, an attack like he did on bitcoin private would have cost him about $100,000 in hardware.“Nicehash and the ability to rent hashing power fundamentally changes the landscape of 51% attacks,” geocold51 told CoinDesk, adding:“If there’s not a lot of hashing power to secure it, but there is a lot of value associated with it, that’s where you can do a 51% attack.”Because geocold51 announced the livestream on Reddit (the post got 1500 upvotes and 60,000 views, he said), the attempted attack got quite a bit of attention – even dogecoin creator Jackson Palmer tweeted about watching.Still, the livestream didn’t work exactly as planned, and because of that, geocold51 said he would run a complete attack later. He told CoinDesk he will do it without a stream this week and release a recording of his demonstration on YouTube shortly after.The young security researcher’s handle might remind some of another security guru.According to geocold51, he was inspired by one of the most legendary hackers of recent years: geohot, who famously jailbroke the original iPhone, which means the restrictions on carriers and apps were removed.These days, geohot likes to livestream himself searching for vulnerabilities.And geocold51 figured he could start doing the same within the cryptocurrency ecosystem.Geocold51 has a good knowledge of crypto. Back when GPU hardware was still lucrative for hobbyist miners, geocold51 mined quite a bit of bitcoin. He then began trading money on Cryptsy, before the exchange’s CEO allegedly walked away with millions of dollars in its user’s money.In that, he lost nearly all his bitcoin.But he still remained interested in the space, and continued to study up on how it all worked. And as the industry divided into hundreds and thousands of different cryptocurrencies, geocold51 thought he might be able to shine some light on the security pitfalls.And others were interested in that too. His Reddit post about the challenge garnered 1500 upvotes and over Twitch, he received $888 in donations.What’s also interesting is that bitcoin private wasn’t his first target.Instead, geocold51 had intended to go after einsteinium, a volunteer-run litecoin fork with a $19 million market cap and $598,000 in trading volume per day, at the time of this writing.He announced his intent publicly, and as he got ready for the attack, commenters within his Twitch feed noted that the cryptocurrency’s hash rate was spiking.Because he had announced the attack in advance, the einsteinium community boosted the hash rate because it was worried that such an attack could cause a chain split and create a second blockchain that people could get stuck on, according to Ben Kurland, one of the project’s board members. At that time, einsteinium was in the middle of a wallet upgrade. If users or exchanges did not upgrade their wallets in time, the blockchain split could have caused property loss.Seeing the increased hash power, geocold51 decided to attack bitcoin private instead.According to geocold51, he got over 600 views during the Twitch livestream, before Twitch shut the stream down. The team at Twitch, he said, temporarily suspended him under the “attempts of threats of harm” section of its community guidelines.He got another livestream up on Stream.Me a half-hour later.Once broadcasting there, he was able to hire miners through Nicehash to mine bitcoin private. In fact, he almost immediately mined a block. And in very little time, he was controlling more than 50 percent of the hash power on the blockchain.Pretty soon an account called “CommunityWatch” popped up in the stream and wrote: “Just a quick question: I’m assuming everything we are doing here is legal?”Minutes later, geocold51’s video feed on Stream.Me cut out.Geocold51 told CoinDesk that he had already gotten about two-thirds of the hash rate on bitcoin private. He’d transmitted his first transaction to a second wallet he controlled. And he had written another transaction onto an offline chain that went to a third wallet he controlled.He was about to send this longer chain to the network, but since the whole point was to show people the attack could be done easily, he stopped once the livestreams shut off.Still, geocold51 is determined to follow through with his mission, and so will record his next attack to share on YouTube soon.And while this vulnerability is likely to be worrying to many in the community, geocold51 noted that there is another way these coins are protected based on cryptocurrency game theory.If someone tried to sell any significant volume of the coins, their price would likely plummet, since the community isn’t robust enough and doesn’t have huge amounts of liquidity. As such, geocold51 argued, even if it is easy to buy hash power and take over a network, it might not be feasible to make a lot of money from an attack.Nevertheless, geocold51 is committed to continuing, using the donations he received to maybe even try to 51% attack more cryptocurrencies as well.In fact, he told CoinDesk, he may intentionally attack some cryptocurrencies that have set up preventative measures for 51% attacks, to test them in production. For instance, the team developing Horizen (formerly zencash) believes it’s found a way to disincentivize 51% attacks by introducing certain miner penalties.Geocold51 said he would be happy to fail against some of these measures.Running the demonstrations privately and adding some production value on the final recording will likely make for more edifying content, according to geocold51, but he’s still a bit disappointed that his original plan didn’t pan out.To CoinDesk, he concluded:“There is something kind of neat about it being live.”Twitch, Stream.Me and bitcoin private’s teams did not reply to a request for comment for this story.UPDATE (25 October 14:46 UTC): This story has corrected the number of views on the Twitch stream.Hand shadow on keyboard image via Shutterstock"

al-Sadaqa (Arabic for “the Charitable Giving”) and claimed to be raising 
funds ...","Sep 10, 2018 at 21:00 UTC","A new report from a Washington, D.C. think tank presented last week argued that cryptocurrencies aren’t well-suited for terrorist financing – while also highlighting the limited success terrorist groups have had attempting to raise funds with the technology.","The paper was produced by the Foundation for Defense of Democracies’ Center on Sanctions and Illicit Finance and presented during a hearing before the U.S. House of Representatives Services Committee’s hearing on terrorism financing. Authored by Yaya Fanusie, director of the center, the full text has since been published on the Committee’s website.Noting that “cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology are not innately illicit and should not be feared,” the report provides an overview of several cases in which groups used cryptocurrency to raise funds.These include pro-Islamic State websites, a group based in Gaza, a group allegedly connected with Al-Qaeda, and a contractor training ISIS fighters. It also cites the case of Ali Shukri Amin, who pleaded guilty in 2015 after he penned a blog post explaining how ISIS could raise money using bitcoin.Still, the technology isn’t well suited for those who are raising funds in war-torn areas, writing at one point that “operating financially with digital currencies remains a fringe activity both among the general public and within the population of global jihadists.”“The good news is that most terrorists, particularly those operating on jihadist battlefields, inhabit environments that are not currently conducive to cryptocurrency use,” the FDD notes elsewhere in the report. That said, according to the report, barriers including the public nature of crypto-transactions “may fall away” over time.The FDD also cites reports from 2017 of a fundraising campaign led by a consortium of jihadists in the Gaza Strip called the Mujahideen Shura Council (MSC), which was deemed a foreign terrorist organization by the State Department.The fundraising campaign, named Jahezona (Arabic for “Equip Us”), aimed to raise $2,500 per fighter but ultimately raised “a little over $500 in bitcoin” based on information gleaned from public blockchain data.Notably, the FDD contended that deposits were made via the now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange BTC-e.Another group that tried to attract bitcoin donations called itself al-Sadaqa (Arabic for “the Charitable Giving”) and claimed to be raising funds for fighters in Syria. According to the report, the group was connected to Al-Qaeda and promoted its propagandist content. As a result, al-Sadaqa was able to gather about $685 worth of Bitcoin, the researchers found.The account of another organization, called Malhama Tactical and founded by an Uzbek who served in the Russian military before leaving to join rebels in Syria in 2013, had gathered less than $100 worth of bitcoin as the researchers monitored it.Another element that would serve to curtail the success of such campaigns: the ability of U.S. regulators to watch those transactions in real time, as they have become “proficient in analyzing cryptocurrency transactions,” the report suggests.“While cryptocurrencies are not expected to displace conventional means of terror financing anytime soon, terrorists will likely use them if they grow more accepted for real-world goods and services,” the FFD’s report notes, adding:“Therefore, all agencies with counter-threat financing groups should have dedicated analysts who specialize in blockchain analysis.”Image via Shutterstock"

With that experience in mind, Srinivasan backed Coinmine during its angel round, while the company was still very much under wraps.With its announcement, it revealed that Coinbase Ventures is now also a backer.No stranger to home mining, 21.co attempted to foster an ecosystem of home mining by building the 21 Bitcoin Computer, built both to mine and run bitcoin-based apps.21.co retired support for the device in 2017 and later pivoted to become Earn.com, a company that allowed people to earn bitcoin for replying to emails and completing other tasks. Earn was later acquired by Coinbase, at which point Srinivasan took on his current role.Still, underlying the investment is Srinivasan’s belief in a diversified crypto economy.Despite his prior company’s pivot away from mining, Srinivasan believes that crypto has changed in two substantial ways that make home mining more feasible in 2018 than 2015.“Back in 2015 only bitcoin had any significant share, so the viability of any decentralized mining approach was benchmarked against BTC alone as opposed to 1,000-plus new digital assets,” he said.Thanks to a boom that has brought to market thousands of cryptocurrencies, the technology’s enthusiasts don’t have to compete futilely against Bitmain and other giant pools.“The big difference with decentralized mining in 2018 is that there are now so many different coins and tokens out there that it’s almost certainly possible to make a profit – or at least mine a decent amount of some crypto – via a decentralized home mining device like Coinmine,” Srinivasan wrote.BoostVC cofounder Adam Draper spoke to similar themes when he told CoinDesk he’d backed his 100th crypto startup. He pledged to back 100 bitcoin startups in 2015, but he also saw the industry change into one where there was more to crypto than bitcoin.Innovative new coins alone would not be enough to make Coinmine worth it, though. Srinivasan said it’s also important that so many of these new tokens have been judged worthy enough by the market to maintain significant valuations.Srinivasan sees Coinmine as a bet on more worthwhile coins to come. “There will likely always be some asset or set of assets that Coinmine can mine which makes a profit,” he wrote.Remote updates will be key to Coinmine’s success, in Srinivasan’s view.He’s optimistic about Coinmine’s ability to add new coins later, and he foresees a future where the company could play a key role in launching new tokens. He said, “If Coinmine gets to substantial scale, you might even see some new digital assets in the future with ASIC-resistant hash functions launching directly on Coinmine.”Notably, the system is built to run two tokens: one proof-of-work, one proof-of-stake, though the latter will only be enabled with updates coming in 2019. The anticipated networks for staking currently listed on its website are: tezos, casper, dfinity, filecoin, spankchain, polkadot, cosmos and foam.Still, users will pay a high price for that ease and convenience. As CEO Farbood Nivi explained to CoinDesk, Coinmine will automatically put users into mining pools. It’s one more way of making the product plug-and-play, but it also cedes a significant amount of control.Further, the company will take a 5 percent cut of users’ earnings as they mine, according to a spokesperson for Coinmine.As expected, hardcore crypto enthusiasts cast a lot of doubt on the new product’s potential for return on investment. Rob Paone’s tweet was representative, contending that for a $799 user, users could expect to earn roughly $5 per day, not counting whatever electricity costs accrued.“Sounds like it’s more of a fun/hobby purchase than a purchase for expected return,” Paone wrote.That does seem to be the market Coinmine is aiming for: people for whom $799 is not a major investment and who believe in crypto enough that they think it will eventually see major gains (but also aren’t interested enough to learn how to run their own rigs).Srinivasan agreed, arguing that crypto should welcome Coinmine into the market as a new resource for increasing the security of various networks.He wrote:“I believe that decentralized mining is an important idea and worth trying again. It’s mining as Satoshi intended: many devices around the world with no single point of failure.”Balaji Srinivasan image via CoinDesk Consensus 2016 archive"

But this year it’s struck a handful of deals with crypto startups – most recently the Bitstamp exchange, which announced this week it will be the first in the space to use the vendor’s TRADExpress platform, alongside the likes of the London Metal Exchange.And it likely won’t be the last crypto exchange to do so. Cinnober says it’s looking for other potential partners in the market and sees around a dozen that would fit its criteria for selection: the biggest trading volumes and an effort to gear up for serving institutional investors.“The most suitable ones are those who are looking to participate in the transformation that the industry is going through,” Eric Wall, Cinnober’s cryptocurrency and blockchain lead, told CoinDesk. “We can serve retail-only focused cryptocurrency exchanges, but the ideal customer for us is the one that is looking to cater more heavily to institutional investors.”Getting institutional investors as clients will become crucial for cryptocurrency exchanges to survive, Wall believes, and it will require significant adjustments.He added:“Cryptocurrency exchanges currently are extremely immature from the traditional financial markets perspective. Many of them lack basic knowledge of how to operate robust and reliable financial markets.”In particular, to attract institutional investors, crypto exchanges should provide the same functionality as traditional stock and commodity exchanges do, Wall says, including trade compression, netting and clearing, so that cryptocurrencies can be traded like a typical financial asset.Typically, crypto exchanges operate on pre-funded basis, only allowing users to trade as much as they have on their accounts, while traditional financial exchanges use cleared trades when customers maintain collateral deposited with a clearing house, and the outstanding trades are settled at the end of a trading cycle.“Right now the cryptocurrency exchange market is very inefficient as there are no clearing technologies and clearing houses in place,” Wall explained. “We can help a cryptocurrency exchange become a real exchange that has a clearing module, so trading is more efficient for institutional investors.”This is what Cinnober is going to help Bitstamp with. To start, it will replace the exchange’s matching engine, but “in a later phase, we are looking to help Bitstamp to fit into the market structure that institutional traders expect and require,” Wall said. In particular, Cinnober will allow Bitstamp to become a de facto clearing house for its own trades.To be sure, Wall – who said he has been a customer of Bitstamp himself since 2013 – gives credit to crypto exchanges for their creativity and ability to function in a total regulatory uncertainty, making cryptocurrencies a tradable asset.But now they should learn how to wed established financial market practices with cutting-edge technologies, and the choice for them is “grow or die,” Wall said.Noting that Intercontinental Exchange (ICE, the parent of the New York Stock Exchange), Fidelity Investments, Citi and Goldman Sachs are expected to enter the market with trading and/or custody offerings, he said, “in order for cryptocurrency exchanges to be competitive in that market, they would have to become more sophisticated.”Stepping back, Cinnober has been exploring the crypto space since well before most of its buttoned-up core clientele probably even heard of bitcoin, much less took an interest in it.According to Wall, as early as 2015, the company built a trading system for a Swedish startup called Cryex, but the exchange never went live because it couldn’t get a banking license.In October 2017, Cryex was acquired by another Swedish exchange, Safello, and it’s not clear if it’s going to use Cinnober’s system, Wall said.This year, however, Cinnober has brought a number of other solutions for the crypto industry online. In March, a Cinnober subsidiary called Irisium sold a market surveillance solution to Bitfinex. Then in July, the company partnered with BitGo to deliver a wallet solution for crypto exchanges. And last month, Cinnober announced a collaboration with GAP600, a startup enabling instant cryptocurrency transactions.But Wall framed the Bitstamp deal as more than just another score for his company. Rather, he argued that adoption of institutional-grade technology by exchanges will help address the kind of concerns that have made regulators such as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reticent to approve retail products like bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).As he put it in a tweet Monday:“If there was ever any uncertainty from the SEC to approve a bitcoin ETF owing to exchange immaturity, this is a step forward to close that gap.”Eric Wall image via via YouTube/EFN"

Users can also cash their USDC tokens out into their bank accounts.The stablecoin is the first “fiat token” that CENTRE will release, the post indicates, though no details were provided on any future projects.“Crypto assets and blockchain technology will enable us to exchange value and transact with one another … instantly, globally, securely and at low cost,” Circle said, adding:“A fundamental building block of this vision is the tokenization of fiat currency itself, through what are now referred to as fiat stablecoins. A safe, transparent and trustworthy layer for fiat to operate over open blockchains and within smart contracts is a necessary precondition to the broader and more revolutionary potential of a crypto-powered global economy.”At launch, the token will be available on Poloniex, the exchange Circle acquired earlier this year, as well as OKEx, DigiFinex, CoinEx, KuCoin, Coinplug and XDAEX.Circle is also announcing that the Kyber Network, IDEX, Radar Relay and Tokenlon are partnering with Circle at the protocol level, while Dharma, Origin, BlockFi, MoneyToken, Melonport and Centrifuge will work with the stablecoin for lending, investing or payments, according to the release.Further, the company told CoinDesk that professional services firm Grant Thornton will “assist management” in verifying Circle’s U.S. dollar reserves.With the move, Circle joins a host of other startups in to have recently issued stablecoins – crypto exchanges Paxos and Gemini, startups such as Carbon and Havven, and even corporate giants such as IBM have all announced or released dollar-pegged tokens in recent months.While these companies employ a number of methods to maintain their tokens’ price – ranging from holding an equivalent number of dollars in custody to algorithmic models – they were all developed to streamline the transfer of value, as previously reported by CoinDesk.“Price-stable tokens are foundational requirements for enabling powerful new global financial contracts, products and services on the internet,” Neville and Allaire explained Wednesday.Editor’s note: This article has been updated with new information from Circle. Circle image via CoinDesk archive"

The leading cryptocurrency rose as high as $7,788 on Bitfinex, which operates Tether LLC, the firm that developed the USDT token.Some reports are putting the price drop down to traders losing faith in the token, amid claimed lack of transparency over tether’s true USD holdings and rumored issues at partner firm Bitfinex.Interestingly, other recently introduced stablecoins like Gemini Dollar (GUSD) and TrueUSD (TUSD) are up 1.85 percent and 4.96 percent, respectively.Whatever the reason for the drop, it seems safe to say that traders have likely rotated money out of USDT and into bitcoin and other stablecoins.Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.Traders via CoinDesk archives; charts by Trading View "

Research. News; Learn; Research. Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Sep 17, 2018 at 18:00 UTC","Bancor, one of the most popular and valuable decentralized applications on ethereum, is expanding to the EOS blockchain.","According to a company announcement, the “decentralized liquidity network,” which allows users to trade a range of ethereum-based tokens without depositing funds in an exchange or matching trades in an order book, will bring that capability to EOS.The new cross-chain product, called BancorX, will allow users to trade between select EOS-based tokens – which have yet to be specified – as well as between EOS- and ethereum-based tokens.“Bancor is now evolving into a cross-chain liquidity protocol,” the company explained in the announcement, adding that it has published code for open-source smart contracts on EOS, allowing users to experiment with the protocol in a testing environment.No timeline was set for BancorX’s launch on EOS’ live blockchain.Explaining the decision to launch on EOS, Bancor’s announcement cited the blockchain network’s transaction speeds, which are faster than ethereum’s, as well as its lack of fees – in contrast to the often-costly “gas” fees ethereum users must pay to call smart contracts.As a corollary to the lack of fees, Bancor said that EOS eliminates “front-running risk,” since transactions aren’t prioritized in exchange for paying higher fees.It is worth noting, however, that while EOS transactions are fee-free for users, deploying dapps on the blockchain can be costly for developers, unless they choose to pass the costs on to users.One feature of EOS that Bancor’s announcement did not cite, but which may be relevant to Bancor’s offering, is the ability for a supermajority of the network’s block producers – who maintain the EOS blockchain in a way analogous to ethereum’s miners – to effectively reverse transactions.While block producers cannot erase completed transactions, they can forcibly transfer tokens from one address to another.Nate Hindman, Bancor’s communications director, denied that this feature of EOS influenced Bancor’s decision to expand to that network, instead reiterating the benefits mentioned in the company’s announcement: faster transactions, zero fees and resistance to front-running.The freezing and reversal of EOS transactions has proved controversial, as many in the cryptocurrency community see the inability to do these things as a core appeal of blockchains. Indeed, many commentators reacted negatively to EOS block producers’ decision to freeze transactions from a number of compromised accounts soon after the network’s launch. Subsequently, the network’s arbitration body ordered block producers to freeze yet more accounts.Bancor, in a similar vein, is notable for its decision to write the ability to freeze and reverse certain transactions into its ethereum smart contract, as cryptocurrency developer Udi Wertheimer detailed in a blog post last year.Eyal Hertzog, Bancor’s co-founder and product architect, defended these design choices, citing the infamous DAO hack, which saw millions in funds siphoned away from smart contracts with no way to stop the theft. The incident eventually led the ethereum community to hard-fork the chain in order to reverse the damage.Bancor made use of these capabilities following a security breach in July, when it blocked the transfer of 2.5 million BNT tokens, worth around $10 million at the time. The company was not able to prevent the theft of around $12.5 million worth of ether, however.EOS, in contrast to ethereum, provides the ability to refer alleged thefts to arbitration and to have block producers reverse the damage through accepted – if controversial – methods.Bancor’s protocol is already being used on the EOS network to govern the market for RAM, a resource necessary for the creation of EOS accounts.

However, he added:“We’re definitely seeing a lot of traditional asset managers and banks start to explore how they are going to enter and support this asset class moving forward.”Yet when it comes to bitcoin, Soong said traditional asset managers across APAC still prefer to move their funds into crypto when custody solutions can offer the same security and trust level as banks. Hence, Ledger has an institutional custody partnership brewing with the Japanese bank Nomura.“They [wealth managers] would ultimately prefer to work with traditional financial institutions, which is why partnering with Nomura makes a lot of sense,” Soong said.Corporations, currency exchanges, and banks in Hong Kong have already started reaching out to inquire about crypto custody solutions, Soong said. “Hedge fund managers, people who were in investment banking, are all moving into this space to help build up the infrastructure for this new asset class,” he said.Meanwhile, Ledger is also forging closer ties with the Hong Kong-based blockchain startup Input Output Hong Kong (IOHK), led by ethereum cofounder Charles Hoskinson. Next week, during Hong Kong Fintech Week, Ledger and IOHK will host a joint party for the local crypto community.Ledger image via Shutterstock"

something in their portfolio that's not correlated with the crypto market.","Sep 19, 2018 at 08:00 UTC",Eidoo has become the latest cryptocurrency startup to seek to create a more stable token by tying it to the price of gold.,"The Switzerland-based startup says the ERC-20-compatible token, dubbed the ekon, will sit alongside its multicurrency wallet and decentralized exchange. But perhaps more notably, each token will be redeemable for one gram of 99.9 percent fine gold, which the startup says will be stored in its vaults and audited every 90 days.“People will be able to see the gold stored in the security vaults through a video camera, we will post a link on the website so everyone can control the gold,” Natale Ferrara, the startup’s founder, told CoinDesk in an email via a spokesperson.Fees for buying and selling ekon on the exchange will generate revenue for Eidoo in the form of its EDO token (CoinDesk previously reported on the company’s unique approach to its revenue). Ferrara also said that fees will be assessed if anyone wants to trade in their crypto token for an actual gram of gold.“Each Ekon token will be backed by … [24-karat gold], so we will issue new tokens only if the gold is available and only if the user has completed the KYC and all the legal requirements that the Swiss law requires,” Ferrara wrote.Eidoo raised $27.9 million in a token sale last October, and its app has since become one of the more popular platforms for launching initial coin offerings. As it has expanded services to crypto users, it has added exchange services – an area that the gold-backed stablecoin fits within.The announcement comes amid what one could call a boom in stablecoin announcements, including two – from Gemini and Paxos/itBit – which have won approval from regulators in New York.And while the controversial tether (USDT) remains the market leader in this area, one exchange recently revealed that it’s moving on from the token – suggesting that other rivals could begin to grab at market share.But a gold-backed token is perhaps a strange choice for a stablecoin, primarily because the metal’s price itself isn’t very stable. Its price is down $150 since the spring, but up about $25 over the last month, according to data from APMEX.“Benchmarked against the USD, gold is not necessarily ‘stable,'” Dr. Wang Chun Wei of Australia’s University of Queensland told CoinDesk in an email.He went on to explain:“Most exchanges (and investors) use USD as the reference currency, hence it makes more sense for the stablecoin to be based on that reference currency.”Wei – who released two papers this year, one on liquidity in crypto markets and a second focused specifically on the relationship between the stablecoin tether (USDT ) and bitcoin – acknowledged that some crypto holders might just like having something in their portfolio that’s not correlated with the crypto market.That lack of correlation was something investors spoke to in the context of crypto-based real estate investments.Scott Hoch of Apex Token Fund, for example, previously argued that crypto-native investors want all their investments on a blockchain, which explains why they might favor a token over a gold exchange-traded fund.That way, if someone using Eidoo wants to look at all their assets in one place, including a gold hedge against the risk of the crypto market, then it might help to have a token which does that for them.Others aren’t so convinced, including Kyle Samani of MultiCoin Capital.“This already exists but not tokenized,” he told CoinDesk. “I think it’s hype. Doesn’t change anything.”But for a small brand in a crowded space, hype could make a difference.“I can see the appeal – i.e. the Austrian/libertarian angle,” Wei told CoinDesk.Gold nuggets image via Shutterstock"

(BTC) was ...","Nov 11, 2018 at 11:40 UTC",Market capitalization gets a lot flack for being a poor metric to measure the value of a cryptocurrency – and perhaps rightly so – but that shouldn’t stop traders from using it as a tool to generate a market bias. ,"To summarize: the market capitalization of a cryptocurrency is a function of market price multiplied by the circulating supply, so its fluctuating value ends up visually mimicking that of price action when plotted on a price chart. And if it mimics price action, then technical analysis – the study of market behavior via price movement – can be applied to it just as if the price chart for bitcoin (BTC) was being analyzed. It’s no secret that cryptocurrencies are highly speculative assets that all bank on the widespread adoption of blockchain and distributed ledger technology (DLT). Since the entire market is so reliant on the success of this factor, it’s rare for the trends of individual cryptocurrencies to deviate too far from one another for too long. In other words, they are highly correlated, so if one cryptocurrency goes up or down in price, the others are soon likely to follow.For the swing trader or long-term investor who does not care about intraday price fluctuations, charting the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies or just alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) can be an insightful way to analyze the long-term trend or bias of the broader market. As it turns out, the total capitalization of the altcoin market is at an interesting technical juncture that could soon lead to another boom or bust for the market, which is further analyzed below through the use of technical analysis.If we perform a simple technical analysis of the total capitalization of the altcoin market and connect the two major peaks in 2018, a long-term diagonal downtrend line is created. In technical analysis, breaking a trendline to the upside is a bullish indication and hints the overarching trend is beginning change. The longer-term the trendline, though, the harder it is to break. As can be seen in the above weekly chart, the capitalization came very close to touching the trendline but has since pulled back, as indicated by the visible upper wick. Looking at weekly candlesticks from January and May, another rejection from the trendline could lead to a significant sell-off, whereas a weekly close above the trendline would suggest the long-term trend of the altcoin market is beginning to shift from bearish to bullish. While the weekly chart displays a major resistance hurdle that needs to break for a longer-term market trend reversal to take place, the daily chart reveals a nearer-term perspective on the outlook of the market, which has its own obstacles.The pattern highlighted in the above chart is known as an inverse head and shoulders pattern which is a common ‘bottom’ or reversal pattern. The pattern is comprised of three successive troughs, with the first and the third being similar in width and depth yet more shallow than the middle trough, known as the head. In order for the reversal to take effect, the market capitalization would need to find acceptance above the neckline that was created by connecting the peaks on either side of the head with a trendline.  If successful, the depth of the head can be added to the breakout point to set a potential target. The depth of the head here is $34 billion, so if we add that to an anticipated breakout point, the market would have the potential for a 31 percent increase towards $141 billion in the not too distance future.The Fibonacci retracement levels could be used as intermediate resistance levels, the nearest of which is the 0.382 retracement near $114 billion.ViewDisclosure: The author holds BTC, AST, REQ, OMG, FUEL, 1st and AMP at the time of writing.Chart image via Shutterstock"

Both firms have come under increasing scrutiny following USDT’s dramatic break with dollar parity last week, when the exchange rate briefly dropped as low as $0.85 on the Kraken exchange. It has yet to fully recover.It’s notable, then, that a wallet address controlled by Bitfinex has sent 630 million USDT to an address known as the “Tether treasury” in six large transactions over recent days. The first, of 200 million USDT, was sent the morning of Oct. 14, when Tether’s dollar exchange rate was beginning to hit multi-month lows.Another 200 million USDT transaction followed two days later, when the token’s price was beginning to recover its peg to the dollar. The other 230 million USDT was sent over the following three days.Tether treasury balance (labeled “Bitfinex Treasury”) in red. Image via Next Wave Strat.These transactions have removed a massive chunk of USDT from circulation: CoinMarketCap shows Tether’s market capitalization falling by nearly a quarter as a result, to $2.1 billion at the time of writing.It’s unclear why Bitfinex is taking supply off the market, but one theory is that Tether is getting out of the stablecoin business, buying back its own tokens at a profit.This interpretation was put forward in a recent post by Su Zhu, CEO of the Singapore-based fund manager Three Arrows Capital, and a researcher publishing under the name “Hasu.”According to Tether’s white paper, holders of the token can “redeem” USDT for U.S. dollars, which – according to the white paper – Tether holds in a bank at a one-to-one ratio with the USDT tokens in circulation. In practice, there is little evidence that people are able to do this, and some token holders have complained that getting fiat currency from the company is impossible.According to Zhu and Hasu’s argument, Tether is in effect redeeming the tokens with itself, buying them at a discount on the market and transforming the U.S. dollar collateral from a liability to an asset.It’s worth noting, however, that the tokens have not been destroyed, as Tether said it would do with redeemed tokens in the white paper.“Anyone could make money by arbitraging the USDT spread (the price at which it trades for on exchanges),” Hasu told CoinDesk in a private message, adding, “it would make sense that Tether itself would be participating in these buybacks.”Indeed Dong Zhang, a Chinese over-the-counter (OTC) cryptocurrency trader and Bitfinex shareholder, told CoinDesk that he “actually made money” from USDT arbitrage since the peg broke.“I buy from people who are losing hope on Tether,” he added.Hasu isn’t the only one to espouse the theory that Tether would pursue this kind of strategy, said a vehement critic of Bitfinex and Tether who goes by Cas Piancey. “I’ve had others pose that to me as well,” he told CoinDesk.But Piancey disagrees with Zhu and Hasu’s assertion that “there is nothing shady” about Tether hypothetically buying its own tokens at a discount. If the company is doing so, he wrote in a private message, it means “Tether is only solvent through fraud.”Matthew Green, a cryptography professor at Johns Hopkins University, echoed that sentiment, writing, “by continuing (perhaps deliberately) to exhibit behaviors that increase customers’ doubts, Tether can make a neat profit at their customers’ expense.”The recent drop in USDT’s price coincides with growing doubts about the company’s claim to back its tokens with dollar deposits. The company has been secretive about its banking relationships, which change frequently, according to reports. Nor has the company provided the regular audits of its fiat collateral promised in the white paper.Tether did not respond to requests for comment before press time. A Bitfinex representative called Zhu and Hasu’s analysis “surprisingly fair given the multitude of accusations we face.”Safe deposit box image via Shutterstock"

GUSD or converting it to a non-pegged cryptocurrency such as bitcoin.","Oct 19, 2018 at 09:10 UTC","Huobi, the Singapore-based cryptocurrency exchange, has just launched a solution that enables users to switch between different types of fiat-pegged cryptocurrencies, or stablecoins, in event of market fluctuations.","Announcing the solution, called HUSD, at a press conference on Friday, the firm said Paxos’ PAX, TrustToken’s TUSD, Circle’s USDC and the Gemini exchange’s GUSD tokens are being supported initially.Previously, users that deposited, say, GUSD, were limited to taking out GUSD or converting it to a non-pegged cryptocurrency such as bitcoin. Using HUSD, though, they can deposit one of the four stablecoins and withdraw a different stablecoin of their own choice.Huobi’s chief operating officer, Robin Zhu, further explained that HUSD is not itself a stablecoin or protocol, but rather, a medium that facilitates exchange between the different stablecoins.For instance, if a user deposits 10 PAX to the exchange, the user’s account will be credited with 10 HUSD. When withdrawing these assets after trading, the user can choose to withdraw, say, 10 GUSD, which will be drawn from the pool of GUSD that other users have deposited to the platform.However, whether the user can withdraw all their assets in a single stablecoin depends on there being sufficient supply in the pool.Zhu said he expects the platform could potentially run into a situation where a stablecoin may not have a big enough pool to cover all withdrawal requests. “In those circumstances, we will buy back these stablecoins from their issuers into the pool,” he said.As such, Huobi will not list trading pairs for every stablecoin it supports against major crypto assets such as bitcoin and ethereum. Instead, the company will open trading pairs for HUSD against those cryptos in the coming weeks.Notably, the most established stablecoin to date, tether (USDT) – one that has been at the center of rumors over the reliability of its U.S.-dollar peg – is not included in the pool. Instead, Huobi will open a trading pair for HUSD against USDT on Oct. 22.Zhu explained that the primary reason for that is due to concerns over whether USDT can meet its compliance requirements.He said:“Tether doesn’t have a regularly released auditing report to prove its U.S. dollar reserve.”As CoinDesk reported in June, Tether did release a document aimed to prove its U.S. dollar reserves, but it was prepared by a law firm not an independent auditing company.According to Zhu, HUSD allows users to withdraw the stablecoin asset they consider is most stable, since the market has recently seen several assets wavering from their pegged fiat currency’s value.“The market could see over hundreds of stablecoins in the future,” he noted. “While we welcome the integration of more regulated stablecoins, we hope the use of HUSD could help maintain the stability of this market.”Huobi started accepting PAX, TUSD, USDC, GUSD at 8:00 UTC on Friday, having announced the move earlier this week.Editor’s note: After this article was published, Huobi further clarified that Zhu’s comment on Tether was premised upon the fact that Tether, unlike the other four U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins, is currently unregulated and is subject to a lower regulatory standard.Huobi image via Shutterstock"

(Gemini, the exchange founded by the Winkelvoss twins, does not currently offer trading pairs using its stablecoin.)According to internal data Bibox shared with CoinDesk, trading volume for GUSD pairs on the exchange roughly doubled in the wake of the tether turmoil.Bibox’s trading volume in USDT pairs, meanwhile, fell by around 70 percent. “Traders have less incentive to trade USDT as a method to hedge risk,” the exchange’s co-founder, Aries Wang, told CoinDesk.Even following this shift, however, GUSD volumes pale in comparison to those for the older and better-established tether. Bibox only announced GUSD trading in late September, making it, Wang said, the first exchange to list it.“I think USDT still has a dominant trading volume among all other stablecoins,” Wang said, noting that USDT volume on the exchange fell from a high of $50 million, while GUSD volume rose to a high of $2 million.Indeed, GUSD launched only a month ago, so the surge in volume is from a small base. According to CoinMarketCap, six exchanges currently offer live trading in GUSD, of which just three – Bibox, OKEx and HitBTC – have 24-hour trading volumes above $100,000. And OKEx has only offered trading in GUSD since Tuesday.Still, as CoinDesk previously reported, demand for non-tether stablecoins has caused their dollar pegs to break as well, driving GUSD’s exchange rate as high as $1.09.And judging by a recent spate of listing announcements, USDT’s dominant position appears to be in play.Within hours of Tether’s peg breaking, exchanges rushed to offer trading in Tether alternatives such as GUSD, Circle’s USD Coin (USDC), Paxos Standard (PAX), and  TrustToken’s TrueUSD (TUSD).The rush began with OKEx and FCoin, which announced that they would each list TUSD, USDC, GUS and PAX.Huobi soon followed, saying it would list the same four stablecoins. BitForex said it would list GUSD; ZB.com announced that it would list PAX; and Bit-Z said it would list all four: USDT, GUSD, USDC and PAX. BCEX announced GUSD and PAX trading pairs. An outside spokesperson for CoinBene told CoinDesk the exchange would soon announce listings of GUSD and PAX.Bibox, which had beaten the rush, reminded customers that USDT was not their only option.“What to do now if you are holding #USDT?” the exchange tweeted, throwing in a “face screaming in fear” emoji for good measure. “How about converting it to other #stablecoins such as #GUSD?”Another early adopter of non-Tether stablecoins, DigiFinex, has gone further than the others, announcing in mid-September that it would not only list TUSD, but phase out trading in USDT.“We have set a goal of getting rid of Tether within this year,” DigiFinex co-founder Kiana Shek told CoinDesk. The exchange has since announced the additions of PAX and USDC, she added. “We are looking forward to the day Tether falls and [are] well-prepared.”Tyler Winkelvoss image via Instagram"

A member of the publicly traded Match Group, which controls most of the world’s major dating apps, Tinder was able to pierce the public consciousness by making online dating feel more like a game.And for all the memes and Tumblrs it has spawned, the Tinder team has a reputation as a focused product company, one with an app honed to make introductions between strangers through its innovative double opt-in approach.Morris serves as director of product and revenue at the dating site.And he told CoinDesk, that experience has provided a lot of lessons that help him decide what crypto companies to invest in and that the broader crypto industry might need to take heed to.But as someone in a super successful traditional tech company, Morris’ realization that the crypto industry was flush with innovative ideas didn’t come right away. There wasn’t much pushing him to really think heavily about crypto until his career network started shifting and displayed that he might be missing something.He told CoinDesk:“Crypto didn’t feel super real to me until I saw people I knew working at brand name companies going to work on crypto projects.”And so, at the start of the year, Morris wrote on Chapter One’s website that he wanted to invest in 10 crypto projects in 2018. He’s already surpassed that, though, with 12 investments made, five of which are companies that haven’t told the public they exist yet.He added, “The hardest part right now is having the discipline to say no.”What’s so exciting about the crypto space to Morris is that it’s all built around digital goods – which he has seen the power of at Tinder.While subscriptions lead Tinder’s revenue, under the hood, the dating app is one of the most successful digital product apps of all time.It has introduced two digital products – Tinder Boost, which increases the number of times a user gets seen for a certain amount of time, and the Super Like, which allows a user to alert another user that they’re overly interested – that have been extraordinarily popular.Indeed, Tinder dominated the iOS app store in revenue in 2017. With 3.8 million average subscribers (paying users) in the second quarter of 2018, Tinder’s revenue this year will eclipse $800 million, more than double what it brought in in 2017, according to projections from its executives.Tinder doesn’t break out specific revenue numbers for Super Like or Boost, but their success shapes Morris’ thinking about the promise of crypto.While both of those products have been successful, the company had to be thoughtful about how they were introduced and rolled out so that people understood them and wanted them and so that their value didn’t get diluted.And when Morris invests in a crypto company, he wants that same amount of attention.“I have definitely seen the power of digital goods at Tinder in terms of creating intellectual property that adds value to consumers lives,” he told CoinDesk. “When I saw CryptoKitties created, I thought: This could be the start of an entirely new application of digital goods.”And with that, Morris concluded:“If you can create scarcity and if you can create value for users through digital goods, the margins are great.”What could hold the crypto industry back, Morris thinks, is the lack of people with specific product experience.Sure the space is full of great engineers, he said, but it needs product professionals who know how to guide engineering teams to build things people actually want and need and make it easy for the desired user base to adopt and start using.As such, Morris, who was already an angel investor before the fund was set up, told CoinDesk, “I am investing in the best product teams I can find in this space who have shipped products at scale before.”For example, he pointed to the CEO of one of his portfolio companies, Robert Leshner of Compound Finance, the crypto lending platform. Leshner previously held a product role at Postmates, a mobile-first company that facilitates local delivery and has been a solid success.That’s the kind of resume he believes the crypto industry needs so the use cases can “persevere for a sustained period of time.”CryptoKitties and Augur, he said, have had their moments, but they haven’t sustained interest for very long. The best crypto-adjacent product he’s seen for holding users has been Brave, but it’s not really its crypto product that’s kept people around, it’s their ad-blocking browser.To this, he said:“[The crypto industry is] reaching a point where layer one is starting to require product thinkers.”Those people, he argues, will be more focused on problem-solving and less interested in the decentralization narrative – “decentralize all the things” – which has been holding the industry back in his mind.An easy example to point to, last year, during the initial coin offering (ICO) boom, a lot of companies came out with decentralized versions of well-known tech companies (such as Ebay, Netflix or Spotify). The trouble is, those companies are already solving the problems their customers needed solved, and so decentralized versions are unlikely to go very far.Morris warned, “It isn’t going to work if you’re just copying current use cases.”Instead, the decentralized web needs completely new uses for the internet.“I’m really excited to see people enter the space who really build these things from scratch,” Morris said. “The internet is kind of this giant paywall … or it’s set up to make you hit paywalls. When the internet is more open, it’s exciting from a product point of view.”Still, it’ll be a tough sell to bring this segment of tech talent into the crypto space at the moment.Even if a well-funded ICO can pay competitively, an elite product executive is going to find themselves leading a tiny team compared to those at a well-established company, which isn’t necessarily appealing.“I’ve seen projects have an easier time recruiting engineers than A-level product talent,” he told CoinDesk.But, he does think, that will change with time.According to Morris, the first really powerful digital products on the decentralized web will likely show up in gaming. That’s been historically true because gamers and game companies are less conservative about technology and try new things often.Plus, gamers already spend a significant amount of money on digital goods. Decentraland’s Tony Sheng recently wrote a blog post about the power of scarcity and the incentives for game makers to adopt crypto models.Yet, that isn’t to say that only game companies are thinking about the possibilities of blockchain right now. In fact, Morris thinks it’s much, much broader than that.“I think every major consumer tech company has probably already asked themselves: ‘How seriously should we explore blockchain? How relevant is it to what we do?” he said, adding:“There’s probably more activity happening than we could even really understand now.”Courtesy photo of Jeff Morris, Jr. "

withdrawals for major cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether since July.","Oct 30, 2018 at 19:15 UTC","The world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange Binance has frozen accounts that received more than 93,000 ether from two wallets indirectly linked to the troubled Russian exchange WEX.","The accounts were frozen on October 25, Leah Li, a spokeswoman for Binance, told CoinDesk. The action was taken in response to pleas from WEX users who have been watching the ethereum blockchain, the known location of a public wallet belonging to the WEX exchange, uneasily in recent months while they have been unable to withdraw their funds off the exchange.These users traced the flow of funds through the ethereum blockchain and concluded that the two wallets that sent the ether to Binance – in 25 transactions from August through October – were controlled by entities related to WEX. The traders have expressed concern that they won’t get their money back now that the funds have been moved to Binance.They are worried because WEX, a successor to the defunct BTC-e exchange that inherited its infrastructure, has not allowed withdrawals for major cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether since July. Given a lack of answers or clarity about the state of affairs at WEX, frustrated users began filing police reports with Russian authorities earlier this month.Hundreds of users appear to be affected by WEX’s ongoing withdrawal issues, judging from the size of the Telegram chat groups devoted to discussing the situation; one has more than 1,000 members, another focused on filing police reports has more than 400.And at least $18 million is now believed to be at risk, based on the market value of the ether that flowed into Binance. The total figure could be higher, since only ether has been spotted leaving WEX-linked wallets so far, and users have been unable to withdraw most other coins for months.The situation underscores the risks crypto users have long faced when trusting exchanges with their money. WEX opened for business shortly after the U.S. government shut down BTC-e in July 2017, slapping it with a multi-million dollar fine. At launch, WEX founder Dmitrii Vasilev framed the new exchange as a re-launch of BTC-e and said he was working with the old platform’s administrator and would restore its customers’ balances.For almost a year, WEX functioned normally and had the full trust of former BTC-e users, some of them told CoinDesk. But the situation has gone quickly south, perhaps best exemplified by the highly inflated prices for many of the exchange’s trading pairs.“Help us to return our money!” a trader named Maxim M. wrote in an Oct. 20 email to Binance and shared with CoinDesk. “If you don’t want to follow the path of BTC-e, which was closed down by the authorities following its use in the laundering of cryptocurrency stolen from Mt. Gox, you should suspend all the WEX’s wallets and accounts.”Vasilev did not respond to requests for comment for this story.Binance’s Li said the Malta-based exchange was “not familiar with the specific situation at WEX,” but “we always investigate user claims thoroughly and we will suspend account access if any unusual activity is detected.” She added:“We are encouraging users who may be impacted to file reports with local law enforcement and ask them to send us case numbers or official notices/letters of investigation. So far, we haven’t been provided with any notices yet.”Li later clarified that the freeze is only temporary, saying, “we’re only able to freeze accounts for a short time; some sort of letter from law enforcement is required for a longer-term freeze.”A CoinDesk review of public ethereum data found that the trail from the two wallets that sent ETH to Binance ultimately leads back to an address that was controlled by BTC-e.Further, the analysis shows that the BTC-e-tied address is linked, by way of a divergent path of transactions, to the one wallet clearly belonging to WEX.The BTC-e address is identified as such on Etherscan, a popular ethereum block explorer. Often, exchanges ask Etherscan to attach their brand name to their wallets, and if they can prove they are the real owners, the name gets assigned. Binance’s address is similarly labeled, but none of the more than 10 others are in the web of transactions between it and BTC-e.The series of transactions began on July 29, 2017, when 485,705 ETH was transferred from the BTC-e address in one batch to another address that users believe to be WEX’s first wallet. Subsequently, that address sent 480,000 ETH in 32 large, round-number transactions from September 2017 through January 2018 to a single address. CoinDesk has confirmed that this wallet, pictured in the image below, belonged to WEX, since six users provided screenshots of their WEX withdrawal transactions – all of which involved the address, 0xb3AAAae47070264f3595c5032eE94b620A583a39.But this WEX wallet was not the only recipient of ether from BTC-e. Another 184,772 ETH was transferred to the address 0x95cDdecd01856aA896426bd1ee021D87F3A5c199, and from there, smaller portions later traveled through several different addresses.Eventually, two addresses – each connected to the BTC-e wallet through a different chain of six addresses – sent significant amounts of ETH to the address identified on Etherscan as belonging to Binance.The first of these wallets sent 78,581 ETH to Binance in about two dozen transactions between August and October. The other wallet sent 14,794 ETH to the exchange in three transactions on October 15, October 18 and October 22.Maxim, the trader, said Binance’s initial response to his alert was discouraging.“They responded that they can’t do anything so far but would watch those wallets carefully,” he said.The text of Binance’s response, which Maxim sent to CoinDesk, reads: “Really thanks for your information, we are willing to cooperate with you. But at present it is hard for us to check all the account from WEX and take action. Anyway, we will keep an eye on this issue, if any update please feel free to contact us.”While Binance spokesperson Li said the accounts were frozen on the 25th, this information was apparently not shared with frustrated WEX users until after CEO Zhao Changpeng (CZ) was asked about the issue on Twitter.On Monday night, a Twitter user going by the name John James tweeted: “WEX cold wallets are moving funds through @binance. Meaning Binance is potentially help launder millions of dollars worth of stolens funds from Wex users. We have proof too. @cz_binance.”CZ responded quickly: “The identified accounts are frozen, please report to law enforcement and have a case number. We will work with LE. This is part of centralization we hate too, dealing with other exchange’s mess (we don’t even know the details). But we will do what we can.”Drain image via Shutterstock; Address graphs created by Anna Baydakova for CoinDesk"

stablecoins, because the dollar is still the default currency in some of 
these ...","Oct 18, 2018 at 20:50 UTC","Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by adjusted volume, is actively looking to list more stablecoins in addition to the three it already supports, which include the recently beleaguered tether (USDT).","“We hope to be able to list a few more stablecoins on our platform,” chief financial officer Wei Zhou told CoinDesk Thursday.But that does not mean the Hong Kong-based exchange is souring on USDT, which lost its parity with the U.S. dollar on Monday and has yet to fully recover, trading at $0.976 on Thursday.“As a whole, we believe things will even out. We will continue to support USDT,” Wei said.Indeed, Binance’s interest in expanding its stablecoin options predates tether’s breaking of the buck. The exchange added support for Paxos Standard (PAX) in late September, weeks before USDT lost parity, and TrueUSD (TUSD) back in May.Currently, Wei said the Binance research team is evaluating almost all the other stablecoins on the market, such as the Gemini Dollar (GUSD) backed by the Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss. All of these newer stablecoins also broke their one-to-one fiat peg this week during the frenzy, though unlike USDT, they rose above $1 rather than falling below it.Speaking to Binance’s recent expansion in Uganda to work with local institutions for fiat on-ramps, Wei added:“Rather than hold bitcoin, [institutions] actually prefer to hold more stablecoins, because the dollar is still the default currency in some of these countries. That’s just one use case that we’ve seen that’s different in this part of the world, versus other parts of the world.”Part of that appeal for institutional players – especially if a heavily monitored asset like GUSD enters the mix – will involve analytics tools developed with the investigation software provider Chainalysis to help improve Binance’s compliance procedures.To be sure, Binance still sees USDT as a linchpin of the crypto markets.Regarding tether, Wei said:“We do believe this stablecoin, as an entity, is critical for our ecosystem right now because it offers an alternative for investors to park their assets in something they can relate to.”Lately, however, many investors have been pulling out rather than parking assets in USDT, and Binance briefly suspended withdrawals of the stablecoin earlier this week when price fluctuations followed a trading spike.Wei said the oscillation was sparked by “rumors being spread untruthfully” about Tether, the company that issues USDT and has close ties to crypto exchange Bitfinex, although he added that “from our perspective, we believe the market is always right.”According to CoinMarketCap, bitcoin-USDT pairings made up over 14 percent of Binance’s global volume over the past 24 hours, in addition to 12 percent of traction from USDT pairings with other popular altcoins. (The exchange ranks No. 1 by 24-hour volume if one excludes no-fee markets and transaction mining, No. 3 if such trades are included.)Yet some are skeptical about the prospects for the newer, regulator-oriented stablecoins to take up some or all of tether’s slack.Nic Carter, a co-founder of Coinmetrics.io and partner at Castle Island Ventures, argued that stablecoins are currently used by traders who lack fiat on-ramps for regulatory arbitrage or want to avoid capital controls.“I don’t believe traders will adopt the regulated alternatives, like the Gemini Dollar, which has anti-money laundering built into it,” Carter told CoinDesk, adding:“To me, those aren’t even playing in the same sandbox.”Binance image via Shutterstock"

Research. News; Learn; Research. Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Sep 13, 2018 at 17:45 UTC","Josh Garza, the CEO of the now-defunct cryptocurrency mining company GAW Miners, has been sentenced to 21 months in prison after pleading guilty to a wire fraud charge.","As part of the sentence, Garza was given 6 months home confinement and three years of supervised release overall. The court proceedings, which took place on a cloudy day in Hartford, Connecticut, saw several customers of the disgraced company read statements about their experiences with GAW. Garza himself gave a courtroom statement prior to the sentencing and expressed remorse about his actions.Thursday’s sentencing caps a years-long saga that began in 2014, with allegations that GAW was acting as a Ponzi scheme by selling more cryptocurrency mining processing power than the firm actually possessed. During that time, GAW released a controversial cryptocurrency called paycoin that would feature prominently in the Justice Department’s case.It also marks a conclusion of sorts for an early effort by the U.S. government to police the crypto space, arguably setting the stage for some of the enforcement actions and lawsuits filed in the past year and a half against a slew of alleged scammers.The original allegations of fraud made against GAW – vociferously denied by Garza and other supporters at the time – ultimately proved to be true in the wake of the company’s 2015 collapse and subsequent lawsuits initiated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and, later, the Justice Department.Internal company emails leaked amidst GAW’s collapse also included revelations about paycoin, its failed cryptocurrency project that was pitched as having a price “floor” at $20, as well as confirmation that the company was being investigated by the SEC.Paycoin would later feature in the Justice Department’s lawsuit against Garza, with the SEC avoiding that element of GAW’s operations in its focus on the so-called “hashlets,” which the company pitched as “virtual miners” that the U.S. regulator later deemed a security.Garza pleaded guilty in July of last year in the Justice Department’s case, though the SEC suit remains ongoing, according to public records.GAW Miners, based in the United States, initially served as a reseller and distributor of mining equipment, later moving into the hosted mining business – that is, the firm would purchase and operate machines on behalf of its customers.Toward the latter half of 2014, GAW began pitching the Hashlet, which the company sold through an in-house marketplace. It was around this time that skepticism about GAW’s claims began to steadily grow, including questions about its mining operations, relationships with well-known businesses and Garza himself, who played an outsized and at-times controversial role in public messaging on social media channels and in the media.Indeed, GAW made waves that August when he announced that he had purchased the BTC.com domain name for $1 million. It would later be shown that the domain name was obtained through a long-term agreement that ultimately lapsed.In December of 2014, GAW launched paycoin. At the time, Garza publicly delcared, “I have confidence that paycoin will be established as the new dominant global online currency.”But opposition to GAW had been steadily growing, with a public gulf widening between the company’s often-zealous clients on its official forum and opponents – in many cases customers or former customers themselves – on BitcoinTalk. Even still, the coin was positioned as a payments-friendly altcoin with the backing of GAW.Yet as CoinDesk reported at the time, paycoin would ultimately fail due to the very same pump-and-dump tactics that Garza and GAW decried when launching it. As data from CoinMarketCap shows, paycoin’s $20 “floor” didn’t last long, as the price tumbled below $2 by the end of January 2015.A buyback scheme was subsequently announced, but the cryptocurrency’s price continued dropping in the days that followed.Ultimately, the paycoin debacle would prove to be the first stage in a months-long collapse for GAW. The period saw Garza himself go (in the eyes of some) from cryptocurrency messiah to cryptocurrency pariah.February saw the release of hundreds of thousands of internal emails, including those written by Garza himself, which revealed the existence of the SEC inquiry – reported first by the cryptocurrency blog CoinFire but denied at the time by the company. Subsequently leaked emails would also show that GAW had, in fact, sold more mining processing power than it actually possessed.The following weeks and months featured the emergence of new efforts to revive GAW’s fortunes, through aborted services like Mineral (a crypto exchange) and CoinStand (a paycoin-focused site for buying products from Amazon).That summer, a power company in Mississippi won a default judgment against GAW after the company failed to pay for power at a facility in the state.In December 2015, Garza, GAW and ZenMiner, an affiliated mining company, were sued by the SEC for the unlicensed sale of securities and operating a Ponzi scheme, as CoinDesk reported at the time. An investigation by the Justice Department, simultaneous with the SEC pursuit, culminated with the wire fraud charge guilty plea.Nearly two years after the initial SEC lawsuit filing, a U.S. district judge held Garza liable for more than $9 million, a move that came months after the SEC’s bid for an $11 million default judgment against GAW Miners and ZenMiner was approved.Josh Garza (on the right) image via CoinDesk archives"

But the tone distinguishing this event from the plethora of blockchain conferences was an acute focus on shortcomings and open-ended questions.“Decentralization is not a myth,” Demirors, founder of Athena Capital and chief strategy officer at the asset manager CoinShares, told the audience. “It just hasn’t been implemented properly yet.”She was hardly the only one to espouse this view. In his presentation, Dogecoin creator Jackson Palmer even went so far as to lambaste the Bitcoin Core team for the “centralized way” in which they fixed the recently discovered bug in bitcoin’s code, which involved coordinating with bitcoin miners behind closed doors.Palmer also said there is a “complete lack of transparency” about who manages the Bitcoin Core code base, and that he believes the whole bitcoin ecosystem suffers from a lack of diversity regarding both programming languages and implementations.“A lot of people in the space are afraid to reflect on bitcoin,” Palmer told CoinDesk, questioning why retail adoption is still a rarity. “If bitcoin was a startup, it would be dead. It hasn’t reached product-market fit.”Addressing one of these criticisms, Bitcoin Core developer Matt Corallo told CoinDesk that diversifying bitcoin might require a great deal of extra work to maintain consistency across the complex network, at best, and lead to network forks that reduce bitcoin’s usability at worst.“If you have multiple implementations that people run, then [nodes] have to run both,” Corallo said. “With multiple languages, you’re going to have different behaviors…you don’t want to rewrite too many things because that’s how you end up with lots of bugs.”One point of broad consensus at the event, though, was that the godfather of cryptocurrencies requires more peer review.“There needs to be more talent working on [bitcoin] full-time,” Palmer told CoinDesk.Corallo agreed, adding the shortage of code reviewers isn’t caused by a lack of funding opportunities. In Corallo’s mind, the problem is a lack of skilled engineers willing to devote their time to this space.Referring to the power to merge changes into the bitcoin code, he said:“People who can press the big red button are much less interesting because they push the big red button when there has been sufficient review.”And regarding the recent bug, Corallo said Bitcoin Core’s mentality is to place more responsibility on reviewers than solely on the shoulders of the few full-time contributors. When the community lacks an abundance of skilled reviewers, the open source process is inherently hindered.So Satoshi Labs co-founder Alena Vranova, who recently left the helm of the crypto wallet maker Trezor to found the nonprofit B Foundation, told CoinDesk her next goal is to create online courses and grants to increase the number of engineers contributing to bitcoin.“More implementations doesn’t necessarily fix the issue of bugs. If you have forks, they can just inherit the bugs,” Vranova said. “You can either create specific bug bounties for different implementations or you can make sure there are plenty of developers who understand the code enough to do peer review.”Throughout the conference’s first day, people expressed differing opinions on how cryptocurrency could change the world.Corallo’s presentation on Thursday will focus on decentralization and mining, especially bitcoin’s underlying principle of censorship resistance, which the developer told CoinDesk he is still unsure could scale to a trillion-dollar market.Crypto Springs co-organizer Elizabeth Stark, CEO of Lightning Labs, a startup that focuses on the scaling solution called the Lightning Network, said corporate incumbents are the biggest threat to the crypto ecosystem.But Lightning developer Jack Mallers, maker of the crypto wallet Zap, took a more enterprise-friendly approach.“This market is really volatile. It’s really immature,” Mallers told CoinDesk, going on to say Lightning-enabled institutional trading could improve price discovery and overall liquidity.Financial products like a bitcoin exchange-traded fund are much more achievable in the next year than mainstream retail adoption, he added.Further, Mallers suggested that the nascent market for futures contracts could help the crypto industry transfer financial risks to professional speculators (much like farmers do with commodity traders), helping smaller players survive. “I think that bitcoin futures are going to help decentralize mining,” he said.Reflecting on the critical mass bitcoin is on the verge of reaching almost 10 years after the original white paper was first published, Mallers concluded:“Either bitcoin will work, and become a trillion-dollar asset, or it won’t and it will go to zero. We’re reaching that point where it will be very binary.”"

However, none saw bigger gains than XRP, whose performance in September wasn’t just bullish, it was record-setting. On September 21 alone, the price of XRP shot up more than 75 percent and ended the day with its most trading volume ever recorded on the popular cryptocurrency exchange, Bitfinex. Further, the explosive move allowed XRP to overtake ETH as the world’s second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, a feat it last accomplished in December of 2017. It should be noted that the surge in price perhaps had some speculative backing. The price run-up in XRP was likely catalyzed by anticipation of Ripple’s upcoming Swell conference scheduled to set off on Oct. 1. The conference is designed to highlight Ripple’s product line and revved up investor interest last year ahead of its inaugural launch.Still, XRP concluded September boasting a near 80 percent month-over-month price increase to cement it as the best monthly performer out of the world’s 25 largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. XRPMonthly performance: +79 percent
All-time high: $3.70
Closing price on September 31: $0.59
Rank as per market capitalization: 2XRP was most productive from Sept 18–22 when its price surged more than 150 percent from $0.27 to a three-month high of $0.69, according to CoinMarketCap. Further, it’s high in market capitalization, $24 billion, helped catapult it above ETH as the world’s second largest cryptocurrency. Several bullish developments took place on the daily chart over the course of September.On September 18th, price broke bullish out of a large falling wedge pattern, hinting a bullish reversal was soon to be likely. On the cryptocurrency exchange, Poloniex, the price went on to surge 145 percent from its close of $0.31 on September 18 to a high of $0.77 on Sept 21. The surge quickly pushed the relative strength index (RSI) value into overbought territory, indicating the bulls were reaching temporary exhaustion. That said, the RSI has since cooled off and its price formed a bullish pennant very similar to that of its structure in mid-December of 2017.Lastly, the Guppy Multiple Moving Average indicator (GMMA) has flipped green on the daily time frame for the first time in nearly 11 months. That indicator uses groups of moving averages to identify changes in a trend and the indicator flipping green is bullish and considered a buy signal. The falling wedge breakout, acceptance above the 200-day EMA, pennant formation and green Guppy, all favor a rally in XRP back toward its recent high of $0.77 on Poloniex. The cryptocurrency might see a “sell the news” pullback after the Swell conference. However, the technical bias would remain bullish as long as XRP is trading above its daily higher low of $0.43.Soon before press time, XRP was trading at $0.58, according to CoinMarketCap.Disclosure: The author holds BTC, AST, REQ, OMG, FUEL, 1st and AMP at the time of writing.XRP logo image via Shutterstock; Charts via TradingView "

Despite the recent turbulence, this market continues to grow.”Further, he suggested that initial coin offerings (ICOs) have the potential to become a viable form of alternative financing. “Already last year, ICOs helped raise over $6 billion in funding and this year this figure will be substantially bigger,” he said.To make the most of this potential, Dombrovskis said the challenge right now is how to “categorize and classify” crypto assets and whether the EU should use existing financial market rules or create a set of dedicated regulations for cryptocurrencies.“In this context, we are currently working together with European Supervisory Authorities on what we call regulatory mapping of crypto assets to answer exactly these questions,” he said. “This will provide a solid ground to build on and to decide on further steps in this area.”Dombrovskis has previously made positive remarks on ICOs as an innovative fundraising method, as reported by CoinDesk in February. He indicated at the time that regulators would take more of a case-by-case approach to govern specific token projects, although he conceded more work would need to be done by the commission.And he isn’t the lone ICO-friendly lawmaker in the EU. Last Friday, a Member of the European Parliament suggested a new rule governing ICOs that would place an upper cap on token sale proceeds, but would also make eligible projects accessible across EU member states.EU flag image via Shutterstock"

in order to ...","Oct 15, 2018 at 04:00 UTC",“It exists everywhere.”,"That’s how Athens-based crypto enthusiast named “Sporos” describes faircoin – a tiny, $0.22 asset that in terms of daily trading volume, is barely a glitch on global cryptocurrency exchanges. Although it’s listed at number 1,134 on CoinMarketCap, faircoin users aren’t phased by the market’s disinterest.Instead, they pride themselves on faircoin’s utility – which they say serves as nothing less than a lifeline.“I haven’t used a bank in eight years,” Sporos told CoinDesk.Sporos was speaking from the heart of Exarcheia, an anarchist stronghold in Athens, where he maintains a faircoin information center. One of several hundred similar stations around the world, the center is stocked with homemade products like soaps, honey, olive oils, teas and jewelry, all available for purchase in faircoin.According to available data, there’s an estimated 624 such centers worldwide, each part of what Sporos calls the “faircoin ecosystem,” which includes a transportation sharing app, an AirBnB alternative and even a faircoin-based, tax-free financial institution called Bank of the Commons.Within this network, Sporos refers to himself as a “node.” While typically referring to computers, in faircoin, a node is a human representative that forges links between local initiatives and the global faircoin community, also known as FairCoop.And those that are part of this cooperative trade faircoin – even with its price on CoinMarketCap far lower – for a fixed €1.20. It’s a strict peg that was decided on by an assembly of faircoin users in January.But while the valuation has been reduced on public cryptocurrency exchanges, Sporos argues the underlying infrastructure remains resilient.He told CoinDesk:“Even though if somebody looks at the market price and sees $0.22, and if you have €10,000 you can buy all the coins, and that’s it, even though we have this very low price, our real economy is the people.”Speaking to CoinDesk, Sporos described faircoin as “totally the opposite” of all other cryptocurrencies.“Aside from the blockchain, which is the same technology, the rest, why it is there, the people who use it, the past and the future of it, is totally the opposite,” Sporos said.Created in 2014, faircoin didn’t originate from its current community. Rather, the cryptocurrency was discovered online by anti-capitalist activist Enric Duran, having been abandoned by its original creator (who allegedly created it as a pump-and-dump scheme).“Faircoin was just another coin somebody made,” Sporos told CoinDesk. “Some friends found this abandoned project, they liked the name, they bought the coins from here and there with their money, they acquired 50 million out of 52 million.”A legendary activist, Duran is known for robbing nearly half a million euros in loans from Spanish banks in 2008, before founding a post-capitalist collective, the Catalan Integral Cooperative (CIC).“What they wanted to do was use the legal system and find bureaucratic loopholes to create their own internal economy and structure outside of the state, where people can satisfy their basic needs,” bitcoin developer and early faircoin technical advisor, Amir Taaki, told CoinDesk.From his site in the CIC, Duran organized the fledging faircoin community into an international body, named FairCoop, that seeks collaborations with groups that share similar ideas.At the time of writing, “nearly one thousand freelancers, cooperatives, worker-run businesses and small companies accept faircoin for their work and services,” that serve up to “15,000 users in total,” Duran and a faircoin developer that wished to remain anonymous told CoinDesk in a joint statement.Simply providing “tools for political disobedience,” Sporos said that faircoin often works in tandem with other local currency efforts, providing economic tools for communities to differentiate themselves from state forces.“Faircoin doesn’t have an objective. Whoever uses it has an objective,” Sporos said. “It’s not a community, it’s many communities, collectives, cooperatives, individuals, even people who use it not based on ideology, but just as a tool.”He continued:“It’s just a tool, just a tool to avoid taxes, states, banks, whoever is monitoring your private life.”Consisting of small, community-oriented efforts internationally, faircoin is distinguished from other cryptocurrencies by its emphasis on trust, which is a defining security characteristic of its blockchain.“We as faircoin advocates believe that human trust networked relations and decentralized technologies as the blockchain can and should be combined,” Duran and the anonymous developer continued.Initially built on proof-of-stake, faircoin switched to a new way to protect its cryptocurrency in 2017, named “proof-of-cooperation.” Designed by faircoin core developer Thomas König, proof-of-cooperation is an ultra light-weight consensus mechanism that runs on a set of 19 raspberry pies.“The whole system runs on 60 watts, so two light bulbs,” Sporos told CoinDesk.Seeking to disable the competitive nature of bitcoin mining, proof-of-cooperation requires that all 19 of these nodes must collaborate in order to validate a block – a task for which they’re paid for in transaction fees. Compared to other cryptocurrencies, at a mere 19 block-producing nodes, the underlying group responsible for keeping the network moving are less broadly distributed.And that’s because, in order to become one of these nodes, faircoin deploys a social vetting process – intended to protect its economy from bad actors, like hackers or speculators.The underlying block creators – comprised of what is known as a “cooperatively validated node” – must be approved by the FairCoop assembly, a network of roughly 280 faircoin users responsible for making decisions, to ensure their ideological commitment to the project.For some, this means faircoin is vulnerable to centralization affects, such as censorship resistance, but according to Duran, cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are just as centralized, due to the relatively few companies that can participate in the mining process.Plus, the developers emphasized that while block creation is essentially a federated process, anyone can run a full node to verify transactions are accurate.But the trusted, human element underpinning the blockchain doesn’t stop there. For example, as well as agreeing on cooperatively validated nodes, the FairCoop assembly is responsible for making technical changes to the network, such as fees, block weight and other things, without requiring a system-wide upgrade, or hard fork.Additionally, the majority of faircoin is held in a reserve that is managed by a small set of key holders. These key holders, also called “nodes,” are responsible for distributing the cryptocurrency to “small, dense communities” that use faircoin within their own local economies.As such, there’s a high degree of social coordination that underpins the faircoin ecosystem, which Sporos described as “extremely challenging” given the diverse groups present within the international body.“Human governance of things can be weak, complicated, can be conflicting, can be human,” he told CoinDesk.For example, while faircoin seeks to maintain a stable exchange rate to protect against speculation, the cryptocurrency got swept up in the rising market prices last year, leading to a community decision to increase its valuation from €1.00 to €1.20.Since then, the markets have plummeted, leading to the miscorrelation between its market price and local trade. As a result, the faircoin reserve has insufficient liquidity to properly manage the ecosystem, leading to a poor distribution of wealth among the networks of faircoin users.The exact figures of the reserve aren’t discussed within the faircoin community (a source told CoinDesk that “no one can know” its contents, for fear the knowledge would be corrupting). But speaking to CoinDesk, faircoin enthusiast Matthew Slater described it as “critically low.”“Faircoin’s stability is designed to remove market risk, but in the case of a crash it’s the reserve that takes the hit,” Slater said.While the fixed price was originally increased due to rising markets – the cryptocurrency was officially priced at a mere €0.05 for a number of years – Sporos told CoinDesk that while it’s okay to increase the exchange rate “you cannot go back.”“Everything will crumble down. It’s not economically rational. Exactly because you are committed to acknowledge the official price. That’s why you cannot go back,” he said.Slater, an economist theorist, took a similar stance, citing “psychological reasons” for not bringing down the exchange rate.“It’s governed by people that don’t fully understand the market characteristics,” Slater contended, adding: “There’s an attempt to create an alternative economy but it cannot fully disengage from capitalism.”Additionally, the small set of nodes that underlies the blockchain comes with its own problematics. For example, the majority of nodes need to be online constantly in order for the blockchain function – so if less than a third drop off grid, faircoin will stop processing transactions.But according to Sporos, while the social coordination is at times highly challenging, it’s precisely this grounding in the human condition that gives faircoin its strength. “Tomorrow if an electromagnetic storm wipes out the worlds hard disks, the guys who have bitcoins will not have any wealth the next day,” Sporos said, concluding:  “Even in the super crash, we just turn off the fucking blockchain nodes and use our telephones. ‘Hey brother, hey comrade, hey compañero.’ That’s what we do. So this is the real economy, the real wealth, it’s relations and trust.”Faircoin image via Facebook"

Research. News; Learn; Research. Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Oct 19, 2018 at 19:10 UTC","Tether (USDT) tokens are flooding into a wallet address controlled by the Kraken exchange, one of the few places where the troubled stablecoin can be converted into U.S. dollars.","The exchange’s wallet balance stands at nearly 47.8 million USDT at the time of writing, making it the eighth-most valuable wallet holding this asset, according to the Tether Rich List.Contrast that to the situation less than two weeks ago, on Oct. 7, when Kraken’s tether wallet ranked much lower – 22nd place – and held less than half its current balance: 21.6 million USDT. Archived versions of the rich list show the wallet balance fluctuating between around 10 million and 24 million USDT in the period from late December 2017 to early October.The current balance, in other words, is a notable outlier. The implication, some market watchers have argued, is that traders wish to exchange their USDT for dollars.Kraken is one of the few exchanges that offer direct trades between USDT and dollars. (Others include Bitfinex, which is closely tied to Tether Ltd., the issuer of USDT, and Bittrex.) So the influx is a sign that the cryptocurrency market may still harbor doubts about USDT, which saw its exchange rate fall significantly below its $1.00 peg earlier this week.For instance, on Thursday a Twitter user going by the name Soleil Du Soir posed the question, “What are the reasons to transfer USDT to [Kraken]?” Another user answered, “You can get USD there.”Indeed, Kraken only offers one Tether pair, USDT/USD, so traders cannot exchange USDT for other cryptocurrencies on Kraken.There are other indications that traders are heading to Kraken to offload USDT. On Oct. 15, the date that saw tether’s exchange rate fall the farthest against the dollar, the greatest selling pressure was on Kraken, where USDT briefly touched $0.85. Tether trading volume for that day was the highest it’s ever been on the exchange.Since being listed on Kraken in March 2017, USDT volume has never been higher than its level on Oct. 15 – and its price (depicted) has never been lower than on that date.According to the 2016 white paper for tether, token holders are able to redeem their USDT for U.S. dollars by returning them directly to Tether Ltd. In practice, a number of users have been unable to do so in recent months.Jeff Perrin, the founder of Spiga, a fintech startup, told CoinDesk that he tried to redeem tether tokens for dollars through the company’s site in January or February. He provided all the necessary know-your-customer information, he said, but did not receive any responses from customer support. As of mid-October, he said, his account was “pending approval.”Oguz Serdar, a full-stack developer and the CEO of the marketing startup Limk, described a similar experience in December 2017, saying his account had been “stuck in their verification process for months.”Some have claimed that redeeming tether is still possible. Dovey Wan, a partner at the investment firm Primitive Ventures, wrote recently, “two of my trader friends have successfully redeem[ed],” and posted a screenshot.Yet a Twitter user going by “Auditcarlo,” who is a virulent critic of Bitfinex and Tether, said the screenshot appeared to show trades on an exchange, not redemption through Tether Ltd. Wan did not immediately respond to a request for clarification.With users apparently unable to convert their USDT into dollars in the way envisioned by Tether’s white paper, they seem to be trying to accomplish the same goal by moving tokens onto Kraken.A spokeswoman for the exchange did not immediately respond to questions sent by CoinDesk (nor did a Tether representative).But the official Kraken Support Twitter account addressed potential reasons for the increase in Kraken’s Tether balance: “traders will transfer USDT to Kraken, sell it for USD at whatever rate the market is willing to pay for it at the time, and then they can use the actual USD to buy other cryptocurrencies.”Soleil Du Soir responded to that tweet, asking whether USDT was likely to crash, and Kraken Support replied, “Not necessarily. Not everyone who transfers USDT will sell right away or at any price. Some might be using it for margin trading. Some might be using it for [over-the counter trading]. There are many possibilities.”Despite being the eighth-most valuable cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Tether has long been a subject of concern in the cryptocurrency community, since many doubt that its tokens are fully collateralized by U.S. dollar deposits, and the company has not provided regular public audits, as it said it would in the white paper.Safe image via Shutterstock; charts by Trading ViewSam Ouimet contributed reporting"

What he sent back was a sprawling 30-page evisceration of a technology industry he feels is untethered from reality.","The original message is presented here as a fictional Q&A for clarity. The message remains otherwise unchanged. Read more in our White Paper Reflections series.CoinDesk: Now that bitcoin has entered the history books, how do you feel the white paper fits in the pantheon of financial cryptography advances?Tim: First, I’ll say I’ve been following, with some interest, some amusement and a lot of frustration for the past 10 years, the public situation with bitcoin and all of the related variants.In the pantheon, it deserves a front-rank place, perhaps the most important development since the invention of double-entry book-keeping.I can’t speak for what Satoshi intended, but I sure don’t think it involved bitcoin exchanges that have draconian rules about KYC, AML, passports, freezes on accounts and laws about reporting “suspicious activity” to the local secret police. There’s a real possibility that all the noise about “governance,” “regulation” and “blockchain” will effectively create a surveillance state, a dossier society.I think Satoshi would barf. Or at least work on a replacement for bitcoin as he first described it in 2008-2009. I cannot give a ringing endorsement to where we are, or generate a puff-piece about the great things already done.Sure, bitcoin and its variants – a couple of forks and many altcoin variants – more or less work the way it was originally intended. Bitcoin can be bought or mined, can be sent in various fast ways, small fees paid and recipients get bitcoin and it can be sold in tens of minutes, sometimes even faster.No permission is needed for this, no centralized agents, not even any trust amongst the parties. And bitcoin can be acquired and then saved for many years.But this tsunami that swept the financial world has also left a lot of confusion and carnage behind. Detritus of the knowledge-quake, failed experiments, Schumpeter’s “creative destructionism.” It’s not really ready for primetime. Would anyone expect their mother to “download the latest client from Github, compile on one of these platforms, use the Terminal to reset these parameters?”What I see is losses of hundred of millions in some programming screw-ups, thefts, frauds, initial coin offerings (ICOs) based on flaky ideas, flaky programming and too few talented people to pull off ambitious plans.Sorry if this ruins the narrative, but I think the narrative is fucked. Satoshi did a brilliant thing, but the story is far from over. She/he/it even acknowledged this, that the bitcoin version in 2008 was not some final answer received from the gods..CoinDesk: Do you think others in the cypherpunk community share your views? What do you think is creating interest in the industry, or killing it off?
Tim: Frankly, the newness in the Satoshi white paper (and then the early uses for things like Silk Road) is what drew many to the bitcoin world. If the project had been about a “regulatory-compliant,” “banking-friendly” thing, then interest would’ve been small. (In fact, there were some yawn-inducing electronic transfer projects going back a long time. “SET,” for Secure Electronic Transfer, was one such mind-numbingly-boring projects.)It had no interesting innovations and was 99 percent legalese. Cypherpunks ignored it.It’s true that some of us were there when things in the “financial cryptography” arena really started to get rolling. Except for some of the work by David Chaum, Stu Haber, Scott Stornetta, and a few others, most academic cryptographers were mainly focused on the mathematics of cryptology: their gaze had not turned much toward the “financial” aspects.This has of course changed in the past decade. Tens of thousands of people, at least, have flocked into bitcoin, blockchain, with major conferences nearly every week. Probably most people are interested in the “Bitcoin Era,” starting roughly around 2008-2010, but with some important history leading up to it.History is a natural way people understand things… it tells a story, a linear narrative.About the future I won’t speculate much. I was vocal about some “obvious” consequences from 1988 to 1998, starting with “The Crypto Anarchist Manifesto” in 1988 and the Cypherpunks group and list starting in 1992.CoinDesk: It sounds like you don’t think that bitcoin is particularly living up to its ethos, or that the community around it hasn’t really stuck to its cypherpunk roots.Tim: Yes, I think the greed and hype and nattering about “to the Moon!” and “HODL” is the biggest hype wagon I’ve ever seen.Not so much in the “Dutch Tulip” sense of enormous price increases, but in the sense of hundred of companies, thousands of participants, and the breathless reporting. And the hero worship. This is much more hype than we saw during the dot-com era. I think far too much publicity is being given to talks at conferences, white papers and press releases. A whole lot of “selling” is going on.People and companies are trying to stake-out claims. Some are even filing for dozens or hundreds of patents in fairly-obvious variants of the basic ideas, even for topics that were extensively-discussed in the 1990s. Let’s hope the patent system dismisses some of these (though probably only when the juggernauts enter the legal fray).The tension between privacy (or anonymity) and “know your customer” approaches is a core issue. It’s “decentralized, anarchic and peer-to-peer” versus “centralized, permissioned and back door.” Understand that the vision of many in the privacy community — cypherpunks, Satoshi, other pioneers — was explicitly of a permission-less, peer-to-peer system for money transfers. Some had visions of a replacement for “fiat” currency.David Chaum, a principal pioneer, was very forward-thinking on issues of “buyer anonymity.” Where, for example, a large store could receive payments for goods without knowing the identity of a buyer. (Which is most definitely not the case today, where stores like Walmart and Costco and everybody else compiled detailed records on what customers buy. And where police investigators can buy the records or access them via subpoenas. And in more nefarious ways in some countries.)Remember, there are many reasons a buyer does not wish to disclose buying preferences. But buyers and sellers BOTH need protections against tracking: a seller of birth control information is probably even more at risk than some mere buyer of such information (in many countries). Then there’s blasphemy, sacrilege and political activism. Approaches like Digicash which concentrated on *buyer* anonymity (as with shoppers at a store or drivers on a toll-road), but were missing a key ingredient: that most people are hunted-down for their speech or their politics on the *seller* side.Fortunately, buyers and sellers are essentially isomorphic, just with some changes in a few arrow directions (“first-class objects”).What Satoshi did essentially was to solve the “buyer”/”seller” track-ability tension by providing both buyer AND seller untraceability. Not perfectly, it appears. Which is why so much activity continues.CoinDesk: So, you’re saying bitcoin and crypto innovators need to fight the powers that be, essentially, not align with them to achieve true innovation?Tim: Yes, there is not much of interest to many of us if cryptocurrencies just become Yet Another PayPal, just another bank transfer system. What’s exciting is the bypassing of gatekeepers, of exorbitant fee collectors, of middlemen who decide whether Wikileaks — to pick a timely example — can have donations reach it. And to allow people to send money abroad.Attempts to be “regulatory-friendly” will likely kill the main uses for cryptocurrencies, which are NOT just “another form of PayPal or Visa.”More general uses of “blockchain” technology are another kettle of fish. Many uses may be compliance-friendly. Of course, a lot of the proposed uses — like putting supply chain records — on various public or private blockchains are not very interesting. Many point that these “distributed ledgers” are not even new inventions, just variants of databases with backups. As well, the idea that corporations want public visibility into contracts, materials purchases, shipping dates, and so on, is naive.Remember, the excitement about bitcoin was mostly about bypassing controls, to enable exotic new uses like Silk Road. It was some cool and edgy stuff, not just another PayPal.CoinDesk: So, you’re saying that we should think outside the box, try to think about ways to apply the technology in novel ways, not just remake what we know?Tim: People should do what interests them. This was how most of the innovative stuff like BitTorrent, mix-nets, bitcoin, etc. happened. So, I’m not sure that “try to think about ways” is the best way to put it. My hunch is that ideologically-driven people will do what is interesting. Corporate people will probably not do well in “thinking about ways.”Money is speech. Checks, IOUs, delivery contracts, Hawallah banks, all are used as forms of money. Nick Szabo has pointed out that bitcoin and some other cryptocurrencies have most if not all of the features of gold except it also has more features: it weighs nothing, it’s difficult to steal or seize and it can be sent over the crudest of wires. And in minutes, not on long cargo flights as when gold bars are moved from place to another.But, nothing is sacred about either banknotes, coins or even official-looking checks. These are “centralized” systems dependent on “trusted third parties” like banks or nation-states to make some legal or royal guaranty.Sending bitcoin, in contrast, is equivalent to “saying” a number (math is more complicated than this, but this is the general idea). To ban saying a number is equivalent to a ban on some speech. That doesn’t mean the tech can’t be stopped. There was the “printing out PGP code,” or the Cody Wilson, Defense Distributed case, where a circuit court ruled this way,Printed words are very seldom outside the scope of the First Amendment.CoinDesk: Isn’t this a good example of where you, arguably, want some censorship (the ability to force laws), if we’re going to rebuild the whole economy, or even partial economies, on top of this stuff?Tim: There will inevitably be some contact with the legal systems of the U.S., or the rest of the world. Slogans like “the code is the law” are mainly aspirational, not actually true.Bitcoin, qua bitcoin, is mostly independent of law. Payments are, by the nature of bitcoin, independent of charge-backs, “I want to cancel that transaction,” and other legal issues. This may change. But in the current scheme, it’s generally not know who the parties are, which jurisdictions the parties live in, even which laws apply.This said, I think nearly all new technologies have had uses some would not like. Gutenberg’s printing press was certainly not liked by the Catholic Church. Examples abound. But does this mean printing presses should be licensed or regulated?There have usually been some unsavory or worse uses of new technologies (what’s unsavory to, say, the U.S.S.R. may not be unsavory to Americans). Birth control information was banned in Ireland, Saudi Arabia, etc. Examples abound: weapons, fire, printing press, telephones, copier machines, computers, tape recorders.CoinDesk: Is there a blockchain or cryptocurrency that’s doing it right? Is bitcoin, in your opinion, getting its own vision right?Tim: As I said, bitcoin is basically doing what it was planned to do. Money can be transferred, saved (as bitcoin), even used as a speculative vehicle. The same cannot be said for dozens of major variants and hundreds of minor variants where a clear-cut, understandable “use case” is difficult to find.Talk of “reputation tokens,” “attention tokens,” “charitable giving tokens,” these all seem way premature to me. And none have taken off the way bitcoin did. Even ethereum, a majorly different approach, has yet to see interest uses (at least that I have seen, and I admit I don’t the time or will to spend hours every day following the Reddit and Twitter comments.)“Blockchain,” now its own rapidly-developing industry, is proceeding on several paths: private blockchains, bank-controlled blockchains, pubic blockchains, even using the bitcoin blockchain itself. Some uses may turn out to be useful, but some appear to be speculative, toy-like. Really, marriage proposals on the blockchain?The sheer number of small companies, large consortiums, alternative cryptocurrencies, initial coin offerings (ICOs), conferences, expos, forks, new protocols, is causing great confusion and yet there are new conferences nearly every week.People jetting from Tokyo to Kiev to Cancun for the latest 3-5 days rolling party. The smallest only attract hundreds of fanboys, the largest apparently have drawn crowds of 8,000. You can contrast that with the straightforward roll-out of credit cards, or even the relatively clean roll-out of bitcoin. People cannot spend mental energy reading technical papers, following the weekly announcements, the contentious debates. The mental transaction costs are too high, for too little.The people I hear about who are reportedly transferring “interesting” amounts of money are using basic forms of bitcoin or bitcoin cash, not exotics new things like Lightning, Avalanche, or the 30 to 100 other things.CoinDesk: It sounds like you’re optimistic about the value transfer use case for cryptocurrencies, at least then.Tim: Well, it will be a tragic error if the race to develop (and profit from) the things that are confusingly called “cryptocurrencies” end up developing dossiers or surveillance societies such as the world has never seen. I’m just saying there’s a danger.With “know your customer” regulations, crypto monetary transfers won’t be like what we have now with ordinary cash transactions, or even with wire transfers, checks, etc. Things will be _worse_ than what we have now if a system of “is-a-person” credentialing and “know your customer” governance is ever established. Some countries already want this to happen.The “Internet driver’s license” is something we need to fight against.CoinDesk: That’s possible, but you could make a similar claim about the internet today isn’t exactly the same as the original idea, yet it’s still be useful in driving human progress.Tim: I’m just saying we could end up with a regulation of money and transfers that is much the same as regulating speech. Is this a reach? If Alice can be forbidden from saying “I will gladly pay you a dollar next week for a cheeseburger today,” is this not a speech restriction? “Know your customer” could just as easily be applied to books and publishing: “Know your reader.” Gaaack!I’m saying there are two paths: freedom vs. permissioned and centralized systems.This fork in the road in the road was widely discussed some 25 years ago. Government and law enforcement types didn’t even really disagree: they saw the fork approaching. Today, we have tracking, the wide use of scanners (at elevators, chokepoints), tools for encryption, cash, privacy, tools for tracking, scanning, forced decryption, backdoors, escrow.In a age where a person’s smartphone or computer may carry gigabytes of photos, correspondence, business information – much more than an entire house carried back when the Bill of Rights was written – the casual interception of phones and computers is worrisome. A lot of countries are even worse than the U.S. New tools to secure data are needed, and lawmakers need to be educated.Corporations are showing signs of corporatizing the blockchain: there are several large consortiums, even cartels who want “regulatory compliance.”It is tempting for some to think that legal protections and judicial supervision will stop excesses… at least in the US and some other countries. Yet, we know that even the US has engaged in draconian behavior (purges of Mormons, killings and death marches for Native Americans, lynchings, illegal imprisonment of those of suspected Japanese ancestry).What will China and Iran do with the powerful “know your writers” (to extend “know your customer” in the inevitable way)?CoinDesk: Are we even talking about technology anymore though? Isn’t this just power and the balance of power. Isn’t there good that has come from the internet even if it’s become more centralized?Tim: Of course, there’s been much good coming out of the Internet tsunami.But, China already uses massive databases – with the aid of search engine companies – to compile “citizen trustworthiness” ratings that can be used to deny access to banking, hotels, travel. Social media corporate giants are eagerly moving to help build the machinery of the Dossier Society (they claim otherwise, but their actions speak for themselves).Not to sound like a Leftist ranting about Big Brother, but any civil libertarian or actual libertarian has reason to be afraid. In fact, many authors decades ago predicted this dossier society, and the tools have jumped in quantum leaps since thenIn thermodynamics, and in mechanical systems, with moving parts, there are “degrees of freedom.” A piston can move up or down, a rotor can turn, etc. I believe social systems and economies can be characterized in similar ways. Some things increase degrees of freedom, some things “lock it down.”CoinDesk: Have you thought about writing something definitive on the current crypto times, sort of a new spin on your old works?Tim: No, not really. I spent a lot of time in the 1992-95 period writing for many hours a day. I don’t have it in me to do this again. That a real book did not come out of this is mildly regrettable, but I’m stoical about it.CoinDesk: Let’s step back and look at your history. Knowing what you know about the early cypherpunk days, do you see any analogies to what’s happening in crypto now?Tim: About 30 years ago, I got interested in the implications of strong cryptography. Not so much about the “sending secret messages” part, but the implications for money, bypassing borders, letting people transact without government control, voluntary associations.I came to call it “crypto anarchy” and in 1988 I wrote “The Crypto Anarchist Manifesto,” loosely-based in form on another famous manifesto. And based on “anarcho-capitalism,” a well-known variant of anarchism. (Nothing to do with Russian anarchists or syndicalists, just free trade and voluntary transactions.)At the time, there was one main conference – Crypto – and two less-popular conferences – EuroCrypt and AsiaCrypt. The academic conferences had few if any papers on any links to economics and institutions (politics, if you will). Some game theory-related papers were very important, like the mind-blowing “Zero Knowledge Interactive Proof Systems” work of Micali, Goldwasser and Rackoff.I explored the ideas for several years. In my retirement from Intel in 1986 (thank you, 100-fold increase in the stock price!), I spent many hours a day reading crypto papers, thinking about new structures that were about to become possible.Things like data havens in cyberspace, new financial institutions, timed-release crypto, digital dead drops through steganography, and, of course, digital money.Around that time, I met Eric Hughes and he visited my place near Santa Cruz. We hatched a plan to call together some of the brightest people we knew to talk about this stuff. We met in his newly-rented house in the Oakland Hills in the late summer of 1992.CoinDesk: You mentioned implications for money… Were there any inclinations then that something like bitcoin or cryptocurrency would come along?Tim: Ironically, at that first meeting, I passed out some Monopoly money I bought at a toy store. (I say ironically because years later, when bitcoin was first being exchanged in around 2009-2011 it looked like play money to most people – cue the pizza story!)I apportioned it out and we used it to simulate what a world of strong crypto, with data havens and black markets and remailers (Chaum’s “mixes”) might look like. Systems like what later became “Silk Road” were a hoot. (More than one journalist has asked me why I did not widely-distribute my “BlackNet” proof of concept. My answer is generally “Because I didn’t want to be arrested and imprisoned.” Proposing ideas and writing is protected speech, at least in the U.S. at present.)We started to meet monthly, if not more often at times, and a mailing list rapidly formed. John Gilmore and Hugh Daniel hosted the mailing list. There was no moderation, no screening, no “censorship” (in the loose sense, not referring to government censorship, of which of course there was none.) The “no moderation” policy went along with “no leaders.”While a handful of maybe 20 people wrote 80 percent of the essays and messages, there was no real structure. (We also thought this would provide better protection against government prosecution).And of course this fits with a polycentric, distributed, permission-less, peer to peer structure. A form of anarchy, in the “an arch,” or “no top” true meaning of the word anarchy. This had been previously explored by David Friedman, in his influential mid-70s book “The Machinery of Freedom.” And by Bruce Benson, in “The Enterprise of Law.He studied the role of legal systems absent some ruling top authority. And of course anarchy is the default and preferred mode of most people—to choose what they eat, who they associate with, what the read and watch. And whenever some government or tyrant tries to restrict their choices they often finds way to route around the restrictions: birth control, underground literature, illegal radio reception, copied cassette tapes, thumb drives ….This probably influenced the form of bitcoin that Satoshi Nakamoto later formulated.CoinDesk: What was your first reaction to Satoshi’s messages, do you remember how you felt about the ideas?Tim: I was actually doing some other things and wasn’t following the debates. My friend Nick Szabo mentioned some of the topics in around 2006-2008. And like a lot of people I think my reaction to hearing about the Satoshi white paper and then the earliest “toy” transactions was only mild interest. It just didn’t seem likely to become as big as it did.He/she/they debated aspects of how a digital currency might work, what it needed to make it interesting. Then, in 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto released “their” white paper. A lot of debate ensued, but also a lot of skepticism.In early 2009 an alpha release of “bitcoin” appeared. Hal Finney had the first bitcoin transaction with Satoshi. A few others. Satoshi himself (themselves?) even said that bitcoin would likely either go to zero in value or to a “lot.” I think many were either not following it or expected it would go to zero, just another bit of wreckage on the Information Superhighway.The infamous pizza purchase shows that most thought of it as basically toy money.CoinDesk: Do you still think it’s toy money? Or has the slowly increasing value sort of put that argument to rest, in your mind?Tim: No, it’s no longer just toy money. Hasn’t been for the past several years. But it’s also not yet a replacement for money, for folding money. For bank transfers, for Hawallah banks, sure. It’s functioning as a money transfer system, and for black markets and the like.]I’ve never seen such hype, such mania. Not even during the dot.com bubble, the era of Pets.com and people talking about how much money they made by buying stocks in “JDS Uniphase.” (After the bubble burst, the joke around Silicon Valley was “What’s this new start-up called “Space Available”?” Empty buildings all around.)I still think cryptocurrency is too complicated…coins, forks, sharding, off-chain networks, DAGs, proof-of-work vs. proof-of-stake, the average person cannot plausibly follow all of this. What use cases, really? There’s talk about the eventual replacement of the banking system, or credit cards, PayPal, etc. is nice, but what does it do NOW?The most compelling cases I hear about are when someone transfers money to a party that has been blocked by PayPal, Visa (etc), or banks and wire transfers. The rest is hype, evangelizing, HODL, get-rich lambo garbage.CoinDesk: So, you see that as bad. You don’t buy the argument that that’s how things get built though, over time, somewhat sloppily…Tim: Things sometimes get built in sloppy ways. Planes crash, dams fail, engineers learn. But there are many glaring flaws in the whole ecology. Programming errors, conceptual errors, poor security methods. Hundreds of millions of dollars have been lost, stolen, locked in time-vault errors.If banks were to lose this kind of my money in “Oops. My bad!” situations there’d be bloody screams. When safes were broken into, the manufacturers studied the faults — what we now call “the attack surface” — and changes were made. It’s not just that customers — the banks — were encouraged to upgrade, it’s that their insurance rates were lower with newer safes. We desperately need something like this with cryptocurrencies and exchanges.Universities can’t train even basic “cryptocurrency engineers” fast enough, let alone researchers. Cryptocurrency requires a lot of unusual areas: game theory, probability theory, finance, programming.Any child understands what a coin like a quarter “does,” He sees others using quarters and dollar bills and the way it works is clear.When I got my first credit card I did not spend a lot of time reading manuals, let alone downloading wallets, cold storage tools or keeping myself current on the protocols. “It just worked, and money didn’t just vanish.CoinDesk: It sounds like you don’t like how innovation and speculation have become intertwined in the industry…Tim: Innovation is fine. I saw a lot of it in the chip industry. But we didn’t have conferences EVERY WEEK! And we didn’t announce new products that had only the sketchiest ideas about. And we didn’t form new companies with such abandon. And we didn’t fund by “floating an ICO” and raising $100 million from what are, bluntly put, naive speculators who hope to catch the next bitcoin.Amongst my friends, some of whom work at cryptocurrency companies and exchanges, the main interest seems to be in the speculative stuff. Which is why they often keep their cryptocurrency at the exchanges: for rapid trading, shorting, hedging, but NOT for buying stuff or transferring assets outside of the normal channels.CoinDesk: Yet, you seem pretty knowledgeable on the whole about the subject area… Sounds like you might have a specific idea of what it “should” be.Tim: I probably spend way too much time following the Reddit and Twitter threads (I don’t have an actual Twitter account).What “should” it be? As the saying goes, the street will find its own uses for technology. For a while, Silk Road and its variants drove wide use. Recently, it’s been HODLing, aka speculating. I hear that online gambling is one of the main uses of ethereum. Let the fools blow their money.Is the fluff and hype worth it? Will cryptocurrency change the world? Probably. The future is no doubt online, electronic, paperless.But bottom line, there’s way too much hype, way too much publicity and not very many people who understand the ideas. It’s almost as if people realize there’s a whole world out there and thousands start building boats in their backyards.Some will make, but most will either stop building their boats or will sink at sea.We were once big on manifestos, These were ways not of enforcing compliance, but of suggesting ways to proceed. A bit like advising a cat… one does not command a cat, one merely suggests ideas, which sometimes they go with.Final Thoughts:Image via Consensus archives "

early September, leading some to speculate that the exchange has ...","Oct 24, 2018 at 18:45 UTC",UPDATE (24 October 19:25 UTC): This article has been updated to include comments from a Bitfinex spokesman.,"Shortly before 1:00 p.m. ET Wednesday, Tether, the company behind the dollar-linked stablecoin of the same name, announced via Twitter that it had destroyed 500 million tether (USDT) tokens.Previously, those tokens were held in an account known as the “Tether treasury.” The past few weeks have seen massive influxes of USDT to the Treasury, particularly after the cryptocurrency lost parity with the U.S. dollar last week amid questions about Tether’s access to banking services.From Oct. 14, when USDT started to slip below $1.00, to Oct. 23, 680 million USDT were transferred to the company-controlled Treasury wallet. All of these transfers came from an address controlled by Bitfinex, a cryptocurrency exchange that overlaps with Tether in terms of ownership and management.Bitfinex’s cold wallet’s balance has fallen by around 100,000 bitcoin since early September, leading some to speculate that the exchange has been spending bitcoin in order to take tether off the market – perhaps to push the exchange rate back towards the $1.00 mark, or perhaps even to exit the stablecoin business entirely.As a result of these transfers, the supply of tethers in circulation has dropped by around a quarter in a week and a half, to approximately $2 billion. Now many of these tokens, in addition to having been taken out of circulation, have been “burned” or destroyed by the company.Kasper Rasmussen, Bitfinex’s director of communications, said the action “does not have anything to do with defending dollar parity,” since both the exchange and Tether guarantee 1-for-1 redemptions. He denied that Tether is intentionally scaling back supply.Tether tokens are redeemed “when the amount circulating exceeds the amount required for e.g. Bitfinex or Tether to operate,” Rasmussen said, and the reason most of the destroyed tokens came from Bitfinex’s wallet is that “Bitfinex is one of the main customers of Tether.”In its announcement Wednesday, Tether said that it had not burned all of the USDT in the Treasury account, and that around 466 million USDT remain in the account “as a preparatory measure for future USDT issuances.”The announcement characterized transfers of USDT to the Treasury as “redemption,” a process that Tether described in its original white paper.The 2016 white paper specifies that USDT holders can redeem their tokens for U.S. dollars directly with the company. Tether maintains that every USDT token is backed by a U.S. dollar deposit, but has not convinced many skeptics that the cryptocurrency is in fact fully collateralized.The anonymous anti-Tether campaigner “Bitfinex’ed,” however, disputed Tether’s characterization of transfers to the Treasury as a “redemption,” writing: “Not one person can come forward and say that they converted Tethers to dollars and got wired money from Tether.”Rasmussen, the Bitfinex spokesman, claimed otherwise, telling CoinDesk: “Yes, direct customers of Tether are able to redeem USDT through Tether Ltd.”But many others allege that it is not possible to redeem USDT tokens for dollars with Tether.Burning match image via Shutterstock"

Back in June, Bithumb was hacked for nearly $31 million in cryptocurrency. Later the same month, the exchange claimed that it had reduced the losses to $17 million after retrieving some of the funds.After making security improvements, the exchange said in August that it was looking to renew its contract with the local Nonghyup Bank to offer new account registrations once again.Last month, Bithumb sold more than 38 percent of its total ownership to a blockchain consortium based in Singapore for $350 million.Bithumb image via Shutterstock"

It is currently examining the situation, alongside financial regulators in the country, according to the Reuters report.In July, the Financial Services Commission (FSC), the country’s financial watchdog, set up a new department dedicated primarily to cryptocurrencies and blockchain. Dubbed the Financial Innovation Bureau, it was created to focus on developing policy-making initiatives for the industry.Also in July, a senior executive at the FSC called on the government to pass a bill regulating domestic cryptocurrency exchanges with urgency in order to counter lax security in the industry.At the same time, members of a number of Korean political parties were reportedly expected to submit a number of bills focused on regulating cryptocurrencies, initial coin offerings and blockchain. So far, though, there has been no action on the part of the government.The lack of clear rules is also causing domestic crypto exchanges to increasingly set up in outside jurisdictions, according to The Korea Times in a report today.The news comes after a group of judges, lawmakers and industry experts formed a new group this summer called the Blockchain Law Society, aimed to discuss legal issues surrounding blockchain technology.South Korea flag image via Shutterstock "

such as Cumberland Mining founder Mike Komaransky, Bitcoin Core ...","Oct 9, 2018 at 11:59 UTC",Two blockchain veterans are gearing up to launch what could be the first cryptocurrency exchange in the Persian Gulf to be licensed by a central bank.,"Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, Rain Financial has opened its public waiting list after a year in the Central Bank of Bahrain’s fintech sandbox. Co-founded by Saudi blockchain consultant Abdullah Almoaiqel and Egyptian investor-turned-meetup organizer Yehia Badawy, along with their business partners Joseph Dallago and AJ Nelson, Rain aims to offer both a brokerage for retail crypto investors and an institutional platform along the lines of Coinbase Pro in Silicon Valley.Although at least five other exchanges are also involved with the Bahrain sandbox – a regulatory program where applicants experiment in a closely supervised environment before graduating to full-fledged licensed businesses – Rain was the first to join in September 2017, and expects to launch in early 2019.“What is unique about Rain is they are the most advanced and the closest to graduating,” Khalid Saad, CEO of Bahrain Fintech Bay, a non-profit co-working space for local startups, told CoinDesk.He added:“There’s no cryptocurrency exchange in the region that is officially regulated. Hopefully, Rain will be the first one.”Such an entity could conceivably encourage new capital flows into the crypto ecosystem from a part of the world rich in natural resources like oil and gas. As it stands, few Persian Gulf residents officially participate in the crypto markets, partly for fear of the sector’s shadowy reputation (although Dubai has notably been a pioneer of “smart city” applications of blockchain technology).Crypto-curious investors “are waiting for the right regulations to be in place and the right partners,” Rain co-founder Badawy said. “We are here to fill this demand, with institutional-grade infrastructure.”Intrigued by the potential of this largely untapped market, crypto veterans such as Cumberland Mining founder Mike Komaransky, Bitcoin Core developer Jimmy Song and BRD crypto wallet cofounder Aaron Lasher, have all invested in the Bahrain-based startup. (Rain would not disclose how much it has raised.)Further, Rain has tapped Joseph Dallago, an alumnus of the crypto wallet startup Abra, to be its CEO.To be sure, the Dubai-based incumbent BitOasis has been facilitating bitcoin purchases since 2015, and is also a participant in the Bahrain sandbox.But while BitOasis (which did not respond to several requests for comment) has focused on building an active user base among retail investors, the Rain founders have been meeting with institutional players throughout the region, from bankers to regulators, seeking their support.They faced an uphill battle. Kuwaiti regulators have essentially banned institutional traders from working with cryptocurrencies. Meanwhile, the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority asserted in August 2018 that “no parties or individuals are licensed” to trade bitcoin in the kingdom.“The primary concerns with the regulators in Saudi Arabia is with unregistered entities,” Rain co-founder Almoaiqel told CoinDesk. “Some of the regulators are not aware that bitcoin payments are not really anonymous and there are ways to track these.”After months of educating regulators about the know-your-customer and anti-money-laundering standards applied by Western exchanges, which it plans to follow, Rain says it has secured banking partners to allow fiat-on ramps in all the local Gulf currencies.“It’s been a long journey educating our different regulators and partners,” Badawy said.But Rain has also been fortunate in that “Bahrain is a really advanced and progressive regulator in the region,” Almoaiqel said. And the sandbox environment allowed the company to show the Central Bank of Bahrain how it would operate while limiting the damage should something go wrong.“Whatever goes into a sandbox is designed to be small enough to fail, so that if it doesn’t work out there is remediation available,” noted John Collins, a partner at the advisory firm FS Vector in Washington, D.C. and former head of policy and government affairs at Coinbase.Aside from giving startups “a safe space to work with regulators,” Collins said, sandbox programs around the world are creating “regulatory bridges” across jurisdictions, such as the cooperation between the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority.“That’s another added benefit, especially for crypto exchanges,” Collins told CoinDesk. “If you are able to be in a sandbox but interacting with any number of different regions at the same time, that is a uniquely good fit for a crypto product.”Across the Gulf, crypto adoption has been slow to take root compared to Middle Eastern countries like Turkey and Israel. Yet Rain CEO Dallago told CoinDesk people in the Gulf often value universal assets, such as precious metals, far more than retail investors in Western markets.“We feel like the regional tastes really match up with the characteristics of bitcoin,” Dallago said. “There’s a lot of pent up demand in the region.”Further, Almoaiqel said, “remittance is a huge use case here. The region has a high population of foreign workers.” Indeed, immigrants and expats reportedly make up more than half the population of the Gulf countries except Saudi Arabia.Still, it’s hard to say how much demand there really is given the precarious regulatory climate. The peer-to-peer exchange LocalBitcoins facilitated just $266,634 worth of Saudi bitcoin trades the second week of September, volumes comparable to neighboring countries like the United Arab Emirates. This is a pittance in contrast to places like Argentina, which saw $6.9 million worth of LocalBitcoins transactions the same week.On the other hand, many believe that broader education in the Gulf could tip this scale. So Rain’s co-founders are organizing dozens of local bitcoin meetups from Kuwait to Saudi Arabia, including an event at the Bahrain Fintech Bay headquarters that attracted around 50 participants in July.“The point of these meetups is to educate people in the region about the benefits of digital currency,” Almoaiqel said, concluding:“It’s our duty to counterbalance all the negative news about cryptocurrency scams.”Bahrain image via Shutterstock"

for a ...","Sep 14, 2018 at 21:15 UTC",A top-20 exchange is phasing out an embattled cryptocurrency.,"Digifinex has decided to replace tether (USDT), perhaps the best-known “stablecoin” designed to maintain a steady exchange rate with the U.S. dollar, with a rival, TrustToken’s TrueUSD. Based in Singapore, Digifinex handled $131 million in trading volume over the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap, making it the 16th-largest exchange by that measure.Kiana Shek, Digifinex’s co-founder, told CoinDesk she’d been “looking for ways to get rid of USDT” for months, adding, “I simply don’t believe in tether but I had no choice” but to list it.Speaking of the decision to adopt TrueUSD, Shek said, “through my research, due diligence, and my communications with the TrustToken team, I have come to appreciate their commitment to industry-leading best practices.”She mentioned the team’s compliance with the U.S. Financial Crime Enforcement Network’s (FinCEN) regulations and independent verification by an outside auditing firm.Tether, the company behind USDT, did not give a comment by press time. The firm has been the subject of much negative attention for over a year now, as it has struggled to convince observers that it holds enough dollar reserves to fully back all the USDT in circulation.Despite allegations that the Tether’s owners and management – which overlaps with that of the cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex – are printing money, though, USDT’s value remains pegged to $1.00, and many exchanges list multiple trading pairs in USDT terms.These listings appeal to traders because USDT can be more easily shifted between exchanges than fiat currency. And at the time of writing, tether is the eighth-most valuable cryptocurrency by market capitalization.It is notable, therefore, that a large exchange has decided to move away from offering tether trading pairs and adopt a rival stablecoin instead. Given the high number of stablecoins that have recently launched or are set to launch soon, the competition Tether faces is likely to increase.“The risk from Tether and the need for a new USD stablecoin is so great,” TrustToken co-founder and COO Stephen Kade told CoinDesk, “that exchanges have started trying to create their own.” An example of this trend is the Gemini exchange’s recent announcement of a dollar-pegged cryptocurrency.Kade argued that TrueUSD had an advantage over these rivals, however: “TrueUSD is live and exchange-agnostic,” he said.TrustToken launched TrueUSD in March, the company’s head of marketing and communications Tony Pham told CoinDesk, and plans to launch products linked to the yen, euro and other fiat currencies in the future. And if the goal of wide adoption by exchanges sounds ambitious, TrustToken’s broader push – to tokenize practically any form of asset – is even more so.TrueUSD trading will become available on Monday at 15:00, Singapore time. Initially, Digifinex will offer TrueUSD trading pairs with bitcoin, ethereum and tether.Both tether and TrueUSD trading will remain available for a while, said Pham, before tether is dropped from the exchange.Additional reporting by Brady DaleWeights and measures via Shutterstock"

These usually correlate to searches for wallet balances and transactions.“When investors are looking for a place to custody their funds, they are looking for a one-stop-shop, a place to store all their crypto assets,” Eleftheriadis said. “Certainly, we are going to continue adding more coins and tokens.”Although stablecoins are hardly the only category represented across BitGo’s offerings, some experts believe the trend of adding support for such assets highlights how competition is influencing the startup’s strategy.Speaking to the rush among custodians to diversify while bitcoin’s price remains relatively low and (until Wednesday) stable, Meltem Demirors, founder of Athena Capital and chief strategy officer at the asset manager CoinShares, told CoinDesk:“People [are] trying to find new revenue streams. And when that can’t be done through volume, it has to be done through adding new product lines, new premium services for which you can charge the user, and finding new ways to extend your business model.”Indeed, the hardware wallet startup Ledger is simultaneously partnering with licensed financial institutions to offer custody solutions for 100 cryptos by 2020. Meanwhile, trading platforms like Silicon Valley unicorn Coinbase and traditional financial services provider Fidelity are looking to offer institutional custody services as well. The latter would focus on bitcoin, BitGo’s staple offering.Bitcoin analyst Nik Bhatia agreed with Demirors, considering how many Wall Street institutions are exploring custody services of their own.“It’s about whether they can prove to themselves this is a long-term business model,” Bhatia told CoinDesk. “I think demand will seek out the providers that fit what they are interested in.”Framing the move in a slightly different way, BitGo’s vice president of marketing, Clarissa Horowitz, told CoinDesk that this year was about reshaping the company’s model. The staff has doubled to more than 100 employees as it went from supporting 8 assets to 101 in less than a year, and it now has roughly 300 institutional customers.“In 2018, we’ve been making a transition from being a technology company to a financial services company,” Horowitz said.Only time will tell if BitGo’s strategy will help it attract more institutional customers as the competition heats up. Demirors, for one, is skeptical because such investors already have established relationships with brands like Fidelity and Intercontinental Exchange, the parent of the New York Stock Exchange, which will launch a new trading and custody platform called Bakkt next month.Plus, she said, custody services generally have a low profit margin driven by volume.“The hard part will be for custody firms to justify their pricing,” Demirors said, adding:“I would see no reason to hold dollarized tokens, which by the way are still susceptible to the risk of hacking, when you could take your money and park it with BNY Mellon, which offers FDIC deposit insurance and overnight lending rates on your cash. It just seems very inefficient.”On the other hand, MakerDAO COO Steven Becker argued that dai, at least, has a use case beyond the usual stablecoin function of moving money rapidly between crypto exchanges. Specifically, he said it can serve as a hedge against volatility.“If you’ve got a $150 worth of ETH [the native cryptocurrency of the ethereum network], you pledge that into what is called the CDP smart contract. You can generate, from the back of it, up to 100 dai,” Becker said. While dai is designed to hold its value with the dollar, the holder can redeem it for the pledged ether when the latter’s price recovers.Hence, a custodian like BitGo that supports such assets is effectively giving investors another way to manage risk, Becker said. “It will open up the infrastructure for institutional holders.”Regardless of whether these customers prefer fiat-backed or crypto-backed stablecoins, BitGo aims to cover the whole spectrum and diversify beyond bitcoin.“This effort to support a really, really, broad array of coins and tokens, in order to accommodate these new institutional investors coming in is absolutely part of that focus,” Horowitz said.Featured image courtesy of BitGo"

preferred financial reserve for delinquent lawbreakers. The once-leading ...","Sep 17, 2018 at 12:00 UTC","On September 6, the Fresno Division of the Eastern District Court of California concluded a 14-month-long civil forfeiture case to seize assets and property belonging to Alexandre Cazes, the Canadian national who committed suicide by hanging in Thai prison last summer days after being arrested on suspicion of operating the darknet marketplace AlphaBay.","Cazes, whose death prevented him from standing trial, allegedly facilitated and profited from sales of illegal goods and services to United States and overseas customers on AlphaBay until law enforcement shut down the website in a dramatic confrontation outside of his primary residence, where he was led off in handcuffs on conspiracy charges related to identity theft, fraud, racketeering, trafficking and money laundering on July 7, 2017.According to an arrest video investigating special agent Nicholas Phirippidis played at the International Conference on Cyber Security in January, officials from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Drug Enforcement Administration and Royal Thai Police crashed a squad car into the front gate of Cazes’ Bangkok mansion to lure him into reach before he could encrypt or wipe digital evidence connected to the crimes. That evidence – administrative accounts logged into AlphaBay forums and servers along with text files identifying password credentials for AlphaBay website and hosting services – was located on an open laptop police found in Cazes’ bedroom while conducting a search and entry raid of his home. A separate document breaking down Cazes’ net worth, assessed at $23 million, recorded enormous sums of money, lavish real estate holdings and expensive cars that played up a life of luxury to match the black market fortune the 26-year-old is said to have amassed from commissions levied on AlphaBay transactions. Because the website did not accept traditional payment methods, Cazes possessed more than $8.8 million in cryptocurrencies pooled across 1,605.05 bitcoins, 8,309.27 ether, 3,691.98 zcash and an unknown amount of monero, the financial statement indicated. Customer funds were moved into multiple shell companies and cryptocurrency exchanges undetected this way. Federal complaints say Cazes used “mixers” and “tumblers” to programmatically split and combine the cryptocurrencies between several wallets, obscuring transaction histories.The business fronts and the exchange wallets were linked to bank accounts Cazes and his wife Sunisa Thapsuwan, a native Thai citizen, registered in Thailand, Switzerland and the Caribbean to liquidate the funds into fiat money, including $770,000 in cash he saved on hand. The document marked the private keys and addresses for the wallets next to the cryptocurrency amounts.
Once the funds were converted, the couple splurged on four luxury vehicles – a $900,000 2013 Lamborghini Aventador LP700-4 with a vanity license plate that read “TOR” (a reference to the privacy-enhancing Internet browser), an $81,000 Mini Cooper, a $21,000 BMW motorcycle and a $292,957 Porsche Panamera – and 6 beachfront vacation resorts overlooking the coasts of Thailand, Cyprus, St. Phillips South and Antigua and Barbuda.The cars and the real estate properties, collectively valued at $12 million, were entered as claimants in the forfeiture motion, as were Cazes, Thapsuwan and his parents Martin Cazes and Danielle Heroux, who may have received money and gifts from their son that were purchased with proceeds collected from AlphaBay.A notoriously lucrative enterprise from its inception in September 2014, AlphaBay was the busiest commercial venue on the dark web until Cazes’ incarceration, peaking at over 400,000 lifetime users, 370,000 cumulative listings and $800,000 worth of daily transactions at the time of its collapse. In 2015, AlphaBay made headlines when vendors sold user account data stolen from U.S. ridesharing app Uber and British telecommunications and broadcasting giant TalkTalk in company-wide data breaches. The following year, and the year after, AlphaBay’s own website was compromised by hackers, who exposed upwards of 213,000 private user messages.By then AlphaBay was 10 times the size of Silk Road, an earlier darknet marketplace that reigned as an one-stop shop for drugs, weapons, chemicals, malicious software and pirated and counterfeit information. Silk Road launched in February 2011 but closed in October 2013 when U.S. federal authorities apprehended Ross Ulbricht, its founder, in San Francisco.Ulbricht, a 34-year-old Texan libertarian and University of Texas and Penn State graduate, has been serving a double-life sentence and 40 years in federal prison out of Colorado without the possibility of parole for similar charges the Southern District Court of New York pressed against him in February 2015. However, Ulbricht’s judgment factored in considerably more serious allegations of murder-for-hire. They were permanently dropped in July for lack of evidence, but his sentencing term remained unchanged with the decision.The court’s refusal to reconsider the conviction dealt another blow to defense efforts to reduce his sentence. Two appeals filed with the U.S. Supreme Court in December 2017 arguing Ulbricht’s Fourth and Sixth Amendment rights had been violated were denied in the month prior to the dismissal of the pending murder-for-hire indictments.Amicus curiae briefs drafted by an independent legal coalition in February defending the petition for a writ of certiorari suggested his Internet traffic data was seized without a warrant for probable cause and the judge presiding over his case failed to find the necessary facts to support the sentencing term.A first appeal filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in January 2016 was previously rejected in May 2017. The appeal contested evidence of investigative malfeasance was illegally withheld during trial that, if aired, would have exposed inconsistencies in the prosecution’s line of reasoning and a cover-up incriminating law enforcement in corruption scandals. Two D.E.A. agents were arrested for misusing and pocketing evidence during the course of the Silk Road investigation.
The appeals judge dissented and upheld the jury trial conviction. Ever since, Ulbricht’s family and friends have been campaigning congressional leaders and political allies to commute his sentence under the Twitter handle “@Free_Ross.” In July, the account tweeted a Change.org petition that has garnered over 80,000 signatures asking President Donald J. Trump to grant Ulbricht clemency. Supporters of the clemency claim the justice system mistreated Ulbricht.Like the legal fallout, drama marred the pursuit to unmask his identity. While investigators also went undercover with AlphaBay purchases to dig up clues on Cazes, they implemented decidedly more aggressive means to monitor and bait Ulbricht from behind the screen. Trial testimony revealed intelligence authorities planted local and remote wiretaps on Ulbricht’s computer devices and Internet service providers without court orders at the same time plainclothes police officers interacted with Ulbricht up close in his everyday life to befriend him and earn his trust.As a result, Ulbricht’s defense maintained their client was framed and, in agreement with U.S. Department of Homeland Security special agent Jared Der-Yeghiayan, accused Mark Karpeles, the CEO of the washed-up cryptocurrency exchange Mt. Gox, and Ashley Barr, Karpeles’s colleague, of being the real “Dread Pirate Roberts,” or the handler for the Silk Road administrator account whose ownership has come under dispute for these shared associations.The D.P.R. pseudonym was handed down from user to user, and the National Security Agency possibly acted as an undisclosed force undermining the Silk Road investigation, Ulbricht’s attorneys contended.On the other hand, the government appears to have settled with following Cazes’ paper trail from afar using groundwork investigative tactics, and Cazes’ immediate circle and law enforcement officials have not challenged his leadership over AlphaBay or denounced the U.S. government for misconduct.The federal government tracked Cazes down from his online aliases, as it initially did to Ulbricht before surveilling his Internet traffic with a pen/trap register. Welcome and password recovery emails listed the alleged AlphaBay mastermind’s email address “Pimp_Alex_91@hotmail.com” as a contact source, analogous to the personal email addresses Ulbricht posted in forum boards that discussed Silk Road.Had he stayed alive, Cazes would have been extradited to the U.S. and faced an extensive conviction judgment as Ulbricht had, cyber-security experts and government watchdog groups have hypothesized. Both Silk Road and AlphaBay were situated on the dark web, an underground network of hidden Internet communities accessible only via encrypted software programs and anonymizing routing protocols like Tor and I2P. By 2014, nearly half of the world populated the Internet, prompting government agencies to take notice of the dark web, where the full gamut of cyber-crimes ranging from gambling to child pornography flourished. The ease with which controlled substances could be bought and sold on there quickly evolved into an investigative nexus for the U.S. Department of Justice, which did not respond to requests for comments, to prosecute the war on drugs. Today, the government’s search for accomplices in both the Silk Road and AlphaBay cases has been actively ongoing, supported by a federal cyber-crime division that coordinates with the Internet Crime Complaint Center to tackle computer crimes. In March, the Northern District Court of Georgia arrested Illinois resident Ronald L. Wheeler, also known as “Trappy,” for marketing and promoting AlphaBay. Gray and black market narratives have also persisted. Among notable figures who have double downed on old criticisms of cryptocurrencies, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon and financial economist Paul Krugman once again recently minimized the technology’s pervasive money laundering and tax evasion use cases. Critics, who responded saying the industry titans had rehashed tired points, waged on the contrary that cash and other variations of physical money have been used for these express purposes for centuries, often with greater degrees of secrecy.Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency, was stigmatized early on as the preferred financial reserve for delinquent lawbreakers. The once-leading darknet websites mandated that users pay strictly in cryptocurrencies, which sometimes accounted for the bulk of trading volumes on most major exchanges when Silk Road and AlphaBay were online.For the time being, AlphaBay and Silk Road clones have sprung up in the background and moved immense hauls of illicit goods and services in cryptocurrencies, although none have quite lived up to their predecessors’ legacies. In 2014, the F.B.I. and Interpol took down Diabolus Market, a Silk Road 2.0 former administrators ran upon the downfall of the original Silk Road. Silk Road 3.0, or Silk Road 3 Reloaded, went financially under of its own accord in 2017 after having gone live in 2016. AlphaBay’s successor, Empire Market, surfaced in March and is still very much up and running, according to the website’s search engine indexed results.Lamborghini image via Shutterstock"

The new class action – coming months following its shutdown and the subequence collapse of the  BCC token’s price – consolidates all of the lawsuits previously filed against BitConnect, attorney David Silver of the Silver Miller law firm told CoinDesk.He said via email that Silver Miller has been named the “Class Counsel” in the new suit which, in addition to consolidating the previous ones, also names additional BitConnect owners and promoters who were previously not part of any lawsuits.“As more information has become available, we have learned about more individuals involved in the rampant fraud associated with BitConnect,” he explained, adding:“The Amended Consolidated Class Action Complaint highlights those actors who participated in the creation of BitConnect and the promoters of BitConnect. The amount of fraud, and the amount of investment loss in such a short period of time is staggering. We hope to move the lawsuit along as fast as possible and hold as many people accountable both in the United States and abroad.”The lawsuit cites no less than 22 different legal violations, as well as provides an exhaustive overview of what BitConnect was and outlines its history.BitConnect shut down its crypto-lending platform in January following the issuance of cease-and-desist orders from Texas and North Carolina securities regulators, which claimed the company was engaging in an unregistered securities sale through its initial coin offering.BitConnect’s BCC token tanked as a result, falling from more than $400 to less than $20 in the first weeks of 2018.The sudden loss of value led to a plethora of lawsuits seeking restitution for investors who saw their holdings evaporate, citing fraud and securities sale laws.While these suits were filed through the first half of 2018, various consolidations have led to the most recent one filed last week. It names BitcConnect Public Limited, BitConnect International PLC, BitConnect Ltd, BitConnect Trading Ltd, as well as nearly 40 individuals affiliated with the project, including BitConnect India head Divyesh Darji and promoter Trevon James.Included in the list of defendants in the most recent amended consolidated class action is YouTube, which was sued in July for allowing BitConnect promoters to publish more than 70,000 hours of content.The consolidated lawsuit calls for a jury trial and seeks rescission of the investments made by the plaintiffs. It also looks for compensatory damages for the plaintiffs.Silver concluded that “the ideal outcome is that all of the money is returned to the investors in BitConnect.”Read the full complaint here:2018-10-11 — De 78 – Amend… by on ScribdGavel image via Shutterstock"

There may be a role for the state to supply money to the digital economy.”Various central banks around the world are “seriously” considering the issuance of digital currency, including Canada, China, Sweden and Uruguay, she said. “They are embracing change and new thinking – as indeed is the IMF.”Lagarde noted that major cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, ethereum and XRP, are also “vying for a spot in the cashless world, constantly reinventing themselves in the hope of offering more stable value, and quicker, cheaper settlement.”However, at the same time, the IMF has also again criticized the view that public cryptocurrencies offer an alternative to CBDCs.In a new report, titled “Casting Light on Central Bank Digital Currency” and revealed Wednesday alongside Lagarde’s speech, the IMF said “cryptocurrencies are different along many dimensions and struggle to fully satisfy the functions of money, in part because of erratic valuations.”When evaluating different forms of money in the report such as cash, cryptocurrencies, private e-money and commercial bank deposits, the IMF concluded that “cryptocurrencies are the least attractive option.”The organization went on to say that cryptocurrencies received a low score in settlement speed due to “current technological limitations,” though it acknowledged they do offer the advantage of anonymity, while tech limitations may eventually be overcome.Yet, the IMF says that research on digital currency should continue “resolutely” given that the questions to be answered are “deep and difficult and have far-reaching implications.”While there seems to be a move towards digital currency, it is not without its risks. Lagarde said in her speech that digital currency offers “great promise” in terms of financial inclusion and also provides privacy in payments, but at the same time it could also pose risks to financial integrity and stability.There is a trade-off between privacy and financial integrity too, she said, adding that central banks might design a digital currency, but “anti-money laundering and terrorist financing controls would nevertheless run in the background.”Lagarde said:“This setup would be good for users, bad for criminals, and better for the state, relative to cash. Of course, challenges remain. My goal, at this point, is to encourage exploration.”Christine Lagarde image via Shutterstock"

the Lockbox will mainly support bitcoin, ethereum, and bitcoin cash.","Oct 25, 2018 at 12:50 UTC",One of the oldest software wallet providers in the cryptocurrency industry is launching its first hardware product.,"Announced Thursday, Blockchain has partnered with hardware wallet maker Ledger and started taking orders for a new handheld device called Lockbox. The first batch of shipments will go out in November.While there are a number of hardware wallets on the market, Lockbox stands out in two ways, according to Blockchain CEO and co-founder Peter Smith. First, in addition to storing funds offline like other devices, it will facilitate crypto-to-crypto trades through Swap, the company’s native brokerage, which is launching next week.The aim is to make trading easier with an all-in-one account, Smith told CoinDesk, explaining:“For us, what’s really important right now is to get the product to a point where you don’t need other places to complete your user actions in crypto.”Further, unlike other hardware wallets, Lockbox is “endpoint-controlled,” Smith said. In other words, while the wallet connects to the internet by plugging into a computer, a special key set inside the device will only allow it to connect with legitimate websites, deflecting phishing attempts by fake versions of external platforms like MyEtherWallet, for example.Much like Blockchain’s online platform, which garnered nearly 30 million accounts since its founding in 2011, the Lockbox will mainly support bitcoin, ethereum, and bitcoin cash. However, the team said they are willing to consider adding support for additional assets if there’s proven user demand.Smith added that although his company will be selective about which assets it supports on Lockbox, the Swap brokerage will allow the whole Blockchain platform to expand crypto offerings faster than ever before because it will not be solely reliant on external liquidity sources.“We built a machine trading platform,” he said. “It connects to different liquidity [sources] across the ecosystem, everything from different exchanges to market makers.”As a result, “I think we will be more aggressive on adding assets in the next six months,” Smith said. “In the long run, I see our trading system being both a consumer and a provider to DEXs,” or decentralized exchanges, where traders retain custody throughout the process.All this will be made easier by Ledger’s full scope of support for a variety of cryptocurrencies, scheduled to reach support for 100 assets by 2019.“It’s the first big deal between our two companies and there may be more in the future,” Ledger president Pascal Gauthier told CoinDesk. “When we design technology for us, we design also for our partners. So whatever features we make for the Nano S, we will also make available for our partners, should they have the need.”In the meantime, altcoin traders will be able to pair Ledger’s multi-coin Nano S devices with Blockchain wallets for a smoother trading experience.While Ledger handles the manufacturing side of Lockbox, Blockchain is focused on creating a holistic mobile and platform experience. This collaboration is indicative of a broader shift among industry incumbents seeking to reduce friction for traders, who must generally juggle multiple exchange and wallet accounts, and conduct extensive research about platforms’ security before connecting their devices.“With our products, you can go from cold to hot [storage] in a heartbeat and the device will never reveal the key, so it means that it opens many avenues, especially for traders,” Gauthier said.Concurring with Smith on the role of hardware wallets in DEX platforms, he added:“We believe our security systems and the types of devices that we have will be at the heart of this [DEX] industry.”Speaking broadly to hardware wallet innovations over the past year, Johns Hopkins cryptography professor Matthew Green told CoinDesk the crypto industry is “relearning some of the lessons that smart cards and the secure devices community have learned over the years” about security.On the other hand, Green said there are still design factors that could help improve the devices’ usability, such as more buttons for entering passcodes without relying on a computer for account management.In Green’s mind, the perfect hardware wallet would let users “generate transactions directly without connecting to your computer.”Nikhilesh De contributed reporting.Lockbox image courtesy of Blockchain"

He spent 11 years at EY, with the last four consulting on blockchain and crypto assets until his departure in August.","Since 2015, while there has been a myriad of permissioned blockchain announcements from enterprises, questions have been raised as to the long-term viability of these projects. A common theme in the small number of projects that have gone live is a disconnect between an understanding of traditional industry and the technical understanding required has made the value difficult to define.While there is most certainly a disconnect between business processes and the technology, rather than limiting the development of business cases, I believe it has in fact led to the opposite problem: unjustified beliefs and hype of what the technology can do. I also believe it remains to be proven if permissioned blockchains provide a real business benefit at all.The reason I question whether there is a benefit is that I spent four years working with financial institutions who were trying to find it.While in the first couple of years I was optimistic of their potential, as more and more use cases were objectively evaluated and failed against other technology, I objectively assessed the technology against alternatives and reevaluated my assumptions. What this led to is a shift to advising clients to leverage technology better suited to their problems, and a greater a focus on public blockchains and crypto assets.The challenges I found in applying permissioned blockchains in industry came down to the following: definition, differentiation, process impact, and necessity.The difficulty in describing the challenges with permissioned blockchains begins with the difficulty of defining what it is.At its most basic level, a blockchain could be defined as a data structure, or simply a chain of blocks. However, this definition is rarely what people mean when they talk about blockchains.Typically, discussions around blockchains talk about consensus and reconciliations, due to the original permissioned blockchains that were forks of bitcoin or ethereum being used in a private manner. As time went on, different consensus algorithms were introduced, as well as different ways to store data that no longer used blocks to share data globally, such as R3’s Corda. Consequently, the term “distributed ledger technology” emerged, which people would put in the same bucket as blockchains.Every few months, a government agency somewhere around the world tries to define blockchain or distributed ledger technology for regulatory reasons. A common theme, however, is they rarely define it in a way that differs from a distributed database or even more simply, Google Docs. And if it can’t be differentiated in the definition, then it shouldn’t be considered different at all.So, to be as specific as we can, in this article I will be discussing technology that shares data with other parties in a way specifically designed to prevent central control. If you have the ability to centrally control, you have a database, and it should be assessed and compared as such.No doubt there will still be nuances that this definition misses, but that is part of the problem of the industry: large claims of potential benefits are made, without defining the tool. And if we don’t define the tool, how can we say that it’s right or wrong?Going with the above definition, a blockchain is typically touted as a beneficial system due to its ability to store and communicate data, with redundancy and protection from loss. The data is automatically reconciled across a large number of parties, allowing virtually instant data transfer and tracking. The data can never be changed and the data is fully transparent to prevent fraud.Alternatively, if needed, you can encrypt the data so none of the other parties can see it. Finally, it allows you to run complex programs, perhaps even resembling legal agreements, that all parties can see and gain comfort that they will execute in a particular way.The interesting thing here is that everything that has just been described is all achievable with a distributed database: technology that is widely used in industry, and was around for many years before bitcoin was released.There is, however, one key difference between the two technologies that we’ve included in our definition: blockchains are specifically designed to prevent central governance.This feature doesn’t come for free, however.In a blockchain, every node stores all data. Every node runs every program, and every transaction is sent to everyone across the network. To make changes to a blockchain, new blockchain software would need to be created and distributed to all participants who would need to install over their current version. Each of these requirements adds a non-trivial technology and governance cost to the deployment and ongoing operation of the blockchain.By comparison, to make changes to a database, the administrator makes the changes in the master and they instantly propagate across all nodes. Computation, also, is optimized. In a distributed database where all participants can have a copy of this data and any applications running, they would be able to monitor and review for any unauthorized changes or updates.It may, therefore, be easiest to think of a blockchain as a distributed database with the ability to administer it taken away.The key question to ask then, is what are the reasons an enterprise would prefer to sacrifice many measurable metrics – transactions per second, disk space, speed and efficiency of computation, cost of maintenance – and opt instead for deploying a technology that is harder to administer?At this point, the argument that is typically used is that the removal of central governance is beneficial when doing business with entities who you do not trust. I am skeptical of this argument.Businesses conduct transactions with other entities all the time, and they establish contracts for these purposes. A blockchain is not going to remove the need for a contract, and there’s been little evidence to suggest that such contracts can be encoded with all the nuances required of the law.Another argument raised is that decentralizing the ownership can allow a shared capturing of value. A recent tweetstorm by Alex Rampell, Partner at Andreesen Horowitz, expressed this sentiment, where he hypothesized that the banks would not have lost the upside of the Visa business and fallen behind had they deployed it as a decentralized ledger.Why could the same upside not have been captured by the banks by simply maintaining stock in the spun-off business, and allowing the business to grow in the most efficient way possible? A distributed ledger hypothetically may have allowed the banks to maintain a hold on Visa, but I believe it’s worth taking note of the other side of this coin: the technology would have restricted it from being the most technically efficient business it could be.A somewhat different view I have heard is that blockchain technology is the future, and therefore while we cannot quantify the benefits, it is worthwhile moving to the new paradigm to stay ahead of the curve.Putting aside the obvious risks of attempting to predict the future, the trouble with this logic is that it assumes that “blockchain” is one big nebulous technology, and that moving to a blockchain is the key component, rather than what that future actually looks like and adjusting your product to fit that future.Without knowing the shape of that future, it is a significant technology investment and sacrifice onto a closed network that may or may not pay off.Let’s say the decision is made to go ahead with a permissioned blockchain project. To implement the technology, the entities need to define the rules of the blockchain. To do this, a project typically progresses as follows:When stage three is reached, there is now a trusted central party that will define the rules of the blockchain and define how updates are made and distributed, and all interested parties will accept the outputs of that trusted party.If all entities trust a central party to define standards and distribute updates, what is the benefit of a blockchain over a distributed database managed by the trusted central party? The members of the consortium have a legal relationship with the trusted central party and are accepting any necessary maintenance by default: why not use a far more efficient data management system?This comes back to one of the key value propositions that people are sold on: that this technology can help multiple parties coordinate on a problem with many data points. Where this falls down, however, is that coordination is a human problem, not a technology problem.By the time coordination with all involved parties has taken place, the major problem is typically already solved. Consequently, additional technology is not needed, and certainly not technology that’s incredibly costly in its enforcement of that goal.What much of this comes down to, is the fact that you can never be half decentralized: any level of centralization will end up with the system coalescing around that central point of management.The business and legal worlds operate from an aspect of centralized entities, and while that remains the case, any forced attempts at decentralization are likely to come short. While it is possible that in the future we may see decentralized businesses, they are far more likely to come from the public blockchain world where they are able to grow organically in an entirely new paradigm.In the meantime, institutions and individuals should be evaluating permissioned blockchains like any other technology: it isn’t magic, and it should be assessed like one would assess any other. The benefits of a technology should never be assumed based on buzzwords, hype or fear that “everyone else is doing it so why shouldn’t I?”Instead, benefits should be assessed by asking what is the business problem, what are the different technology options available, and what are the quantifiable costs and benefits of each. There is no reason why an institution should change its technology selection approach for the sole purpose of blockchain projects: they need to be discerning and choose the technology that can demonstrably solve the problem for the lowest cost.To date, I have not seen such an analysis undertaken.Smart businesses will evaluate whether their problem can be solved and at lower cost on a database or a public blockchain, and press those selling the technology for a demonstrable burden of proof.Stained glass image via Shutterstock"

Research. News; Learn; Research. Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Sep 28, 2018 at 08:00 UTC","Everbloom, one of numerous so-called decentralized exchanges (DEXs) for cryptocurrencies that have cropped up lately, is seeking to become a licensed broker-dealer in a bid to attract institutional investors.","Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, the startup is registering with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and is submitting an application for a license from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), the self-regulatory organization (SRO) for securities dealers. If approved, Everbloom would be allowed to profit from services related to trading securities.That’s a must in the company’s view, given the uncertain regulatory environment for tokens issued through initial coin offerings (ICOs), and more specifically the possibility that many of the ERC-20 standard ethereum tokens traded on Everbloom could be deemed securities under U.S. law.“Obtaining a broker-dealer license is a long, tedious and expensive endeavor but we believe a necessary one that will ultimately add long-term value to the company and position ourselves well against our competitors,” said Everbloom chief operating officer Scott Pirrello.Stepping back, most DEXs today are “decentralized” in the sense that they let traders retain custody of their assets and utilize open source platforms that don’t necessarily require know-your-customer (KYC) identity checks. Rival startups like 0x generally outsource such operational responsibilities to entities called relayers and focus on maintaining the underlying protocols.Everbloom takes the opposite approach, aggregating order books from DEX protocol EtherDelta and soon 0x too. It’s essentially a central hub for self-custodied swaps on decentralized exchanges.This may sound ironic if not oxymoronic to some, like punk-pop music or vegan bacon. But, unlike traditional crypto exchanges, Everbloom doesn’t deal with custody or approve trades. It offers what Pirello called a “service-oriented approach” to self-custody by building compliant reporting and analytics features, plus accounting software, into its platform.While the DEX concept was originated by hardcore crypto users who despaired of trusting third parties with their funds, it’s starting to draw interest from the institutional crowd. These button-down investors may not want to handle custody themselves (and larger ones are required to use a qualified custodian anyway), but they don’t want to rely on some shadowy crypto exchange to do it either.Everbloom CEO Andrew Rollins put it a bit more diplomatically:“The appeal of the decentralized or non-custodial exchange approach is they [traders] get to define their own custody solutions.”After raising $2 million from investors such as Mashable co-founder Frederick Townes, Indicator Ventures, and First Star venture firm’s Drew Volpe, an early ethereum investor, Everbloom quietly opened its platform for institutional traders in late July. However, the company won’t charge for its services until the FINRA license comes through.Pirrello said he expects it to take at least a year to get an answer from regulators. In the meantime, the Everbloom platform is mostly a slick interface where anyone can search multiple DEXs’ order books simultaneously and trade directly using cryptocurrency wallets such as MetaMask.Users such as the trading firm Makor Capital are already using Everbloom, free of charge, to submit hundreds of orders per day, sometimes to multiple order books at once. These orders include roughly 900 prospective trading pairs from 140,000 offers aggregated from various DEX platforms.Newblock Capital managing partner AJ Nary, a fund that invests in both tokens and equity, told CoinDesk that although he sees the irony in creating intermediaries for decentralized platforms, it’s important to have “a comfortable trading platform” for his institutional clients. Nary already uses Everbloom himself and is laying the groundwork for his fund to follow suit.Having a team at the DEX startup to call if something were to go wrong is an important factor when he selects which platform to use. For Nary, the prospect of compliant reporting features is also a considerable draw.Even so, there are plenty of DEX startups joining the broader industry “arms race” for institutional users. As such, Everbloom will need more than a license and help hotline to distinguish itself.In addition to the features described above, Everbloom also controls a central portal through which it can offer closed trading groups for accredited investors with third-party KYC certification. Yet the rival DEX startup AirSwap also offers closed trading pools with outsourced KYC through the fintech startup Wyre.DEX creator Trey Griffith, co-founder of the rival startup SparkSwap, said liquidity for large-scale orders will be the key to attracting enterprise users because few DEXs will dominate volume down the road, adding:“Whoever gathers significant volume is probably going to win.”Speaking to this focus on volume through aggregation, Rollins said users can congregate on Everbloom and prove legitimacy for orders across the DEX ecosystem. “The idea behind this is to bridge different pools of liquidity,” he said.Image of Everbloom COO Scott Pirrello (L) and CEO Andrew Rollins (R) courtesy of the company"

contributing to ethereum and bitcoin. It's entirely possible that merely ...","Nov 8, 2018 at 22:30 UTC",The Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) settlement with the founder of EtherDelta is likely the first of many enforcement actions to come against crypto token exchanges.,"Until recently, the SEC’s scrutiny of the cryptocurrency industry largely focused on projects and teams that raised money through initial coin offerings (ICOs) in possible violation of securities laws. But a person familiar with the SEC’s thinking told CoinDesk Thursday that crypto trading platforms have become a significant priority for the agency’s enforcement division.As such, the news that the SEC had charged EtherDelta founder Zachary Coburn with operating an unregistered securities exchange can be seen as a shot across the bow of token-trading platforms.“At this point, if you’re doing an exchange of crypto assets, dealing with U.S. persons, you probably need to get either a no-action letter or get clarity from counsel about whether you are implicating securities laws,” said Andrew Hinkes, an adjunct professor at the New York University School of Law. And while the EtherDelta action was the SEC’s first against a crypto exchange, Hinkes told CoinDesk:“I’m surprised it took this long.”Further, the case shows that even if so-called decentralized exchanges (DEXs) cannot be easily shut down, that does mean no one will be held liable for their activities. Without admitting or denying the charges, Coburn agreed to pay a total of $388,000 in penalties, disgorgement and interest under the settlement.  “This tells you that an exchange that used a distributed set of nodes instead of a centralized server isn’t going to be treated any differently,” Hinkes said. “Just because you make it and then it gets operated by a decentralized network of others doesn’t mean that any prospective responsibility or liability is gone. It’s just possibly relocated.”And notably, the action was taken against Coburn even though he left EtherDelta in late 2017. The trades of ethereum-based tokens on the platform cited by SEC took place between July 12, 2016 and December 17, 2017, around the time of his departure.“It doesn’t matter whether you sell the business or operated it a year ago or a few years ago,” said Preston Byrne, a partner at the law firm Byrne & Storm, P.C. “American securities laws are going to be enforced.”On the other hand, it’s also telling that Coburn’s penalty was merely a low-six-figure fine. He wasn’t banned from participating in capital markets, in part because he cooperated with the SEC, which wants other individuals running or planning to run similar platforms to reach out to the agency first. “The entrepreneur, in this case, cooperated fully with the commission, which is often a good idea,” Byrne said. “It shows the SEC is willing to work with people who are willing to work with them.”Stepping back, since the token sale craze of 2017, numerous DEX platforms have emerged where ethereum-based assets are often swapped without oversight from any licensed entity. According to DappRadar, the leading DEX platform IDEX had roughly 1,401 users over the past 24 hours. With regards to EtherDelta specifically, there were roughly 1,079 trades on EtherDelta over the past 24 hours, about 11 percent less than in the previous 24-hour period. Although the SEC hasn’t clarified which tokens that traded on EtherDelta it considered securities, this action hinted at who regulators consider liable for purportedly decentralized technologies. Speaking of the SEC order and how it relates to the most popular form of ICO token, the ERC-20, Hinkes said: “It says that he [Coburn] founded a company, wrote and deployed the smart contract and exercised complete and sole control over the operations. Based on that, he should have known that his actions would contribute to the violation of the Exchange Act.”In Hinkes’ mind, this opens up a variety of legal questions for developers contributing to ethereum and bitcoin. It’s entirely possible that merely writing and executing code could make technologists vulnerable to legal action in the future if they neglect to create limitations for how that software is used, he said. “EtherDelta could have elected to filter out certain tokens,” Hinkes said. “By not doing so, they opened themselves up for everything, including securities that are issued under ERC-20.“Regardless of which specific tokens are eventually deemed by courts to be unregistered securities, Stephen Palley, a partner at the Washington, D.C.-based law firm Anderson Kill, told CoinDesk his reading of the order implies the majority of EtherDelta’s volume came from “the purchase and sale of unregistered securities.” From Byrne’s point of view, the SEC’s enforcement action could inspire more cryptocurrency companies to avoid having operations in the United States. “There are hubs overseas, Singapore, England, where the laws are much friendlier toward ICOs and tokens,” Byrne said. “The principal task of cryptocurrency entrepreneurs will be ‘how do we maximize our opportunities in those jurisdictions while limiting our exposure to American regulators, and also compliance with American laws, as we conduct business overseas?'”Meanwhile, the U.S.-based DEX startup AirSwap is strategizing for the opaque regulatory climate by partnering with licensed securities dealers and avoiding order books altogether.“Unlike other platforms, AirSwap doesn’t engage in exchange activities–it has no order book, no order matching, and no transaction fees,” AirSwap co-founder Michael Oved told CoinDesk. “Our approach has been to be proactive in seeking advice and to be transparent with regulators.”Several exchanges operating in the U.S., including AirSwap’s rival Everbloom, avoid charging traders fees in an effort to reduce legal risks. Hinkes said this recent order may undercut such approaches.“It doesn’t appear that taking a fee is relevant to their analysis of whether EtherDelta was acting as an exchange that should have registered or proceeded under an exemption, or not,” Hinkes said.This much is certain, the SEC is far from finished with its sweep of the industry, which Palley compared to a five-act play, saying:“They’ve got dozens and dozens of investigations going on. I think we’ll see more press releases, more enforcement actions. This is certainly not the end of anything. This is maybe the end of Act 2 and the beginning of Act 3.”SEC Chairman Jay Clayton image via YouTube"

And, last month, crypto exchange Gemini, blockchain startup Paxos and crypto payments firm Circle all announced their own U.S. dollar-anchored stablecoins are now live for trading.GMO won’t be alone in offering a yen-pegged coin, either, as the founding partners of a $1 billion blockchain fund based in China also revealed plans to roll out a yen-anchored offering in mid-September.

We also offer a custodial solution which is a combination of hot and cold wallet,” she said, although “that offering, though secure, is not regulated like the Trust.”She continued:“The trust company will enable us to offer a qualified custodial offering that is regulated, that has the money laundering and know your customer requirements. Our custodian offering already has money laundering and KYC requirements … [but the Trust is] for institutional clients … especially for those who are registered advisors and broker dealers.”Although BitGo Trust was specifically approved by South Dakota regulators, Ali noted that “generally other states will give you reciprocity in the sense that other states have money transmission laws and they’ll exempt you from money transmission requirements.”BitGo representatives met with state regulators during the process to approve the Trust, she said. Now that it’s been approved, “our hope is to build this platform out, to really demonstrate to regulators and customers that this model can work and we can really build a great trust company that safeguards assets.”Although BitGo has customers who are ready to begin storing their assets with the Trust, under South Dakota regulations, the general public has 30 days to file an appeal against the decision. The company said it is set to begin operations on a technological level, and will do so once the 30-day period has expired if no appeals are filed.Once it does launch, BitGo will immediately begin taking custody of assets, indicated Ali.Ali said the BitGo team has worked to ensure that its custodial offering matches what they believe customers will need to be comfortable storing digital assets. There are currently no standards for the space the firm is entering, so BitGo has had to develop its own to draw in clients.“That’s certainly our hope, we believe that will happen, we’ve obviously engaged with many many large market makers who do not engage with the cryptocurrency space because they can’t custody their assets,” she explained. “Even large family offices that are managing their own funds want a secure option where they don’t have to fear [thefts].”She hopes to draw both institutional investors, as well as family offices, and sees a secure custody offering as a tool to reassure investors and local governments alike that cryptocurrencies can provide value to these groups.Ali explained:“I think you’ll see that the fringes will go back into the dark and cryptocurrency will come into the light and become a globally acceptable either a commodity or security, however it’s structured. I think it’ll alleviate some of the concerns the governments around the world have that it facilitates money laundering, that it facilitates drugs.”BitGo has been working to launch as a regulated custodian since January 2018, when it originally announced it would acquire the Kingdom Trust Company. At the time, Kingdom Trust was a digital asset custodian with roughly $12 billion in assets under storage, as previously reported.The move was aimed at bringing institutional money into the crypto space, CEO Mike Belshe told CoinDesk. BitGo hoped to attract investors who had skills other than technical proficiency in blockchain technology.However, the deal fell through, and in May, the company announced its intention to build its own custodian from the ground up.Marketing vice president Clarissa Horowitz told CoinDesk at the time that the decision was made after the company engaged with customers.“We realized they would be best served by a custodian who was entirely focused on their assets,” she said.BitGo team image courtesy Michelle Marin / BitGo"

Research. News; Learn; Research. Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Oct 29, 2018 at 08:00 UTC","The crypto market has a dominant stablecoin, make no mistake.","Tether, which aims to keep its token (called tether or USDT) at parity with the U.S. dollar by backing each token with $1 in bank deposits, accounts for the vast majority of the stablecoin market by total value, exchange volume and other metrics.But the market has begun to show signs of anxiety around tether, centering on the firm’s access to banking services and its claims to have fully collateralized the outstanding tether supply.The token has not traded at $1 with any consistency since early October. It hit a low of $0.85 on one market on Oct. 15, and while the exchange rate has largely recovered, it still lags below target, trading at $0.99 Sunday, according to CoinMarketCap.Meanwhile, several rival stablecoins have arrived on the market, including – just since September – Circle’s USD Coin (USDC), the Paxos Standard Token (PAX) and the Gemini Dollar (GUSD). Older rivals include TrustToken’s TrueUSD (TUSD) and Maker’s Dai (DAI).As one might expect in such a perfect storm, tether has begun to lose some market share to these competitors in the week and a half since it broke the buck, data analyzed by CoinDesk shows. Yet while TUSD and USDC have made the biggest inroads, the data shows no clear winner at this stage, and tether remains firmly on top.All these coins are vying for a critical role in the crypto ecosystem. Stablecoins, in theory, allow traders to move money between exchanges quickly – without having to rely on access to traditional banking. They also allow traders to move their funds into a less risky asset during times of heightened volatility, without having to withdraw funds from an exchange.Below we dive into the data.There are several ways to measure market share for stablecoins, none of them perfect indicators. One is simply by looking at the market capitalization, which, when the asset is supposed to trade 1-for-1 with fiat, should be about the same as the overall supply.“Tether has definitely lost market share in terms of the supply of USD allocated to different stablecoins,” Nic Carter, creator of the blockchain data site Coinmetrics, told CoinDesk. TUSD and USDC, he added, have been “the major beneficiaries.”Indeed, according to Coinmetrics data analyzed by CoinDesk, tether’s market capitalization as a share of the broader stablecoin market has steadily declined, with most of that decline coming from a reduction in tether supply (a token’s market capitalization is equal to its price multiplied by its total supply).Charts by Nolan Bauerle and Peter Ryan of CoinDesk Research. Data for all charts sourced from Coinmetrics.io. Note that vertical axis scales differ between charts.“Prior to the run,” Carter said, referring to a period in mid-October when tether’s exchange rate dipped below $0.93 according to CoinMarketCap, “tether consisted of about 94 percent of the total supply in stablecoins; that collapsed to 83 percent after the run.”But it’s important not to overstate the competitive implications of that collapse. The primary reason for this shift is that Bitfinex – a cryptocurrency exchange that shares executives and owners with Tether – has sent 780 million USDT to a company-controlled wallet known as the Tether Treasury since Oct. 14.This process, which the company (controversially) refers to as “redemption,” removes tokens from the supply and therefore reduces the market capitalization, which has fallen to around $1.9 billion from a peak of nearly $2.8 billion in September.Hence, reductions in tether’s supply haven’t benefited rival stablecoins as much as might be assumed, Carter noted. “It looks like some USDT that were redeemed did not, in fact, flow into other competitors, but simply exited to BTC or fiat.”Another way to gauge stablecoin market share is to look at what’s happening at cryptocurrency exchanges.Unsurprisingly, during and shortly after the “run,” a number of exchanges – including OKEx and Huobi – rushed to list alternatives to tether.Yet Coinmetrics’ data shows only a slight increase in trading volume for tether alternatives over the course of October, and from a tiny base (note that the vertical axis ranges from 96 percent to 100 percent, and tether remains clearly dominant by this metric):Coinmetrics exchange volume data is sourced from CoinMarketCap.“Exchange volume is small for alternatives because traders aren’t really accustomed to them yet,” said Carter, adding “tether still is considered a useful (albeit risky) coin for traders to get fiat-denominated risk. It just has the accumulated financial infrastructure.”But there’s one more metric to consider: the volume of transactions on the blockchains for these stablecoins.By this yard stick, tether alternatives have made more headway. Compared to modest on-exchange volumes, total on-chain transaction volumes were considerably higher for non-tether stablecoins throughout the month, and they appear to have increased after tether broke the buck:All told, tether is still dominant, but competition from its many rivals is heating up.According to Carter, however, “it’s still too early to say which competitor is best positioned to win long term.”Tether image via Shutterstock "

incorruptibility, which means its store of value qualities trump its 
transactional utility.","Sep 17, 2018 at 03:50 UTC",Michael J. Casey is the chairman of CoinDesk’s advisory board and a senior advisor for blockchain research at MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative.,"The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers.The virtuous circle that saw buyers of ethereum-based ERC-20 tokens drive ether’s price above $1,400 mid-January has morphed into its diametric opposite.The initial coin offering boom has fizzled and the price has sunk to just above $200.This new phase, a vicious cycle downturn that has exposed the ether market’s intrinsic connection to the ICO boom and bust, is of course painful for anyone who bought ether in the last 12 months.But in the spirit of encouraging the crypto community to embrace failure as a real-world source of learning and growth, the experience is also incredibly informative for understanding how value is formed and lost in crypto assets attached to blockchain platforms.This dynamic is still being figured out. However, a strong hypothesis is emerging that the correlation between the price of a token such as ether and its actual or expected network utility —that’s is, its value as the “fuel” in a blockchain ecosystem — might not be very strong.This is challenging for anyone who, like me, was initially enthusiastic about the “fat protocol thesis.” As a recap, that idea, convincingly made by Union Square Ventures partner Albert Wenger, held that the prospect of rising prices for utility tokens allows developers of open-access software platforms to extract value for their work even when the underlying protocol is open and free.It argued that crypto assets and blockchains would overhaul the prevailing Internet paradigm in which value could only be extracted by application developers who could charge users for their services whereas the developers of open-access protocols such as SMTP an HTTP were condemned by the requirement that they be free of charge.But now we’re left wondering whether tokens, these units of value/mediums of exchange – call them what you will – might have their upside fiat-currency monetization power capped because price could be antithetical to utility (which we might define as “transactability.”)In essence, the problem has to do with Gresham’s Law that “bad money drives out good” – the idea being that if you want a currency, or any token used for economic exchange, to function as a fluid enabler of transactions within your community, you don’t want it to be overly attractive as an investment or store of value.If a currency has that “good” quality – i.e. is durable, fungible, scarce, and can’t be debased by some centralized issuer – it will appeal more as something to hold rather than use.This has fueled the idea among mainstream economists that there’s a sweet spot in which the interests of a community – but not necessarily those of the individual – are best served by their money being just a bit “bad.” There needs to be some modest expectation of depreciation or inflation if a currency is to be trading. Communities need people to be willing to offload their currency rather than hoard it.Milton Friedman, the father of monetarist economics, said as much, arguing that a very modest amount of expected, inflationary monetary expansion is desirable. It’s by no means an argument for currency debasement and rampant abuse of fiat power. It’s about optimizing exchangeability versus investment prospects.I’ve argued elsewhere that this might be a problem for bitcoin, not for HODLing investors per se but in whether it can ever challenge the dominant fiat currencies as a medium of exchange. Bitcoin is a very “good” currency in terms of its scarcity and incorruptibility, which means its store of value qualities trump its transactional utility.Many bitcoin enthusiasts dispute this view, arguing that after establishing itself as a solid store of value, a currency can then become useful as a transactional unit. Time will tell whether they are right, but for now I think the store of value treatment of bitcoin is winning out.Notwithstanding its massive price drop since December, anyone who bought into bitcoin in the eight years before its runup last fall will quite satisfied with the returns they’ve had by just holding it. By contrast, real-world, non-capital transactions are few and far between. Layer Two solutions such as Lightning will make transactions easier, but I’m not convinced that this scarce “good” currency will become widely transacted.What does all this have to with ether?Well, as Vijay Boyapati laid out in a provocative tweetstorm, ethereum’s smart contract functionality depends on people using and transacting in ether. That’s what ether’s metaphorical identity as the “gas” of ethereum is all about. But Boyapati said that’s antithetical to the concept of “reservation demand,” a measure of how long people hold a currency and the core driver of the price of a monetary unit.For the brief period of ICO mania last year, Boyaparti argued, ether suddenly attracted reservation demand because investors needed to acquire and hold a store of ether to participate in the ongoing flow of ERC-20 token offerings.But now that flow has stopped. The issuers of those tokens who really just wanted dollars to fund their operations — not a store of ether with which to conduct smart contracts — are now faced with an existential threat if they don’t dump the rapidly falling ethereum tokens they hold. Hence the conversion of a virtuous circle into a vicious circle.Jeremy Rubin, a Stellar developer and former MIT colleague of mine, argued in a TechCrunch piece that these and other aspects of the ethereum ecosystem could drive the price of ether to zero.A key point of Rubin’s was that issuers of tokens that trade on top of ethereum can and will be incentivized to build models in which their smart contract network is managed not by transactions in the underlying “gas” of ether but by the incentives baked into trading in their own token.The piece stirred up a lot of emotion, including a rebuttal of this “economic abstraction” argument from ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin.I’m not convinced of Rubin’s argument that the price is destined for zero even if, as he assumes, ethereum ends up succeeding as a ubiquitous smart contracts platform that enables world-changing dapps.In essence, I think there is some natural base level of reservation demand that will always be there for a unit of exchange that makes a powerful blockchain tick. And it’s hard not to imagine that this level of demand increases if and when ethereum moves to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. At some point, utility value does correlate with price, just not with nearly the same direct relationship that people have assumed.This debate is very important. If a disconnect is established between utility value and price, it will greatly affect how participants in token markets generally treat the assets they are trading. Note, however, that might actually encourage the development of dapps that are all about functionality and not just fronts for quick money-grabbing efforts by crypto startup founders.The jury is also still out on the whether etheruem, or any blockchain platform, is even successful at all. But I look at the incredibly inventive community of ethereum developers toying around with wonderful new ideas for a better world and find it very difficult not to conclude that, in some as yet undefined way, they are creating a great deal of value.It’s just that, sadly for those who thought otherwise, that concept of value might be inherently at odds with the concept of price — at least as it is defined in fiat currencies. And that’s a topic for another day…Ether and gold image via Shutterstock"

Dogecoin's Price Slid 36 Percent in October,https://www.coindesk.com/ruff-month-dogecoins-price-slid-36-percent-in-october,Bitcoin Price Performance (March 2017 to May 2019). Mar '17.,"Nov 1, 2018 at 20:45 UTC",Market data shows that the meme-themed dogecoin was the worst-performing coin out of the world’s largest 25 cryptocurrencies by capitalization for the month of October.,"The cryptocurrency – derided as a joke by some, beloved by others – first hit the market in 2014 and has since been through a series of boom-and-bust cycles ever since in terms of overall market performance.The cryptocurrency’s most recent price boom began at the end of August and extended into early September, when its price surged over 160 percent to reach a six-month high of $0.0068 on September 10th, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Those fortunes reversed in October, resulting in a 36 percent monthly loss that brought the coin’s price more than 50 percent below that September high-water mark. And as can be seen in the chart below, these cyclical price movements are nothing new to DOGE. According to data from Coinmetrics.io, DOGE often provides a 30-day return in excess of 100 percent as depicted by the thin orange line. DOGE’s price vs. BTC is comprised of the orange area in the background, which further shows the cyclical nature of its price action.  In fact, 2015 was the only year to not include a 30-day return above 100 percent, although it did come close with a 94 percent return in a 30-day span. What’s more, the 30-day percent returns have exceeded 300 percent on multiple occasions since 2014. As can be seen, the booms are often followed by busts when the monthly returns hover just above or significantly below zero. This metric entered negative territory on October 10th and has yet to return to a positive value. if(""undefined""==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper[""SXOv6""]={},window.datawrapper[""SXOv6""].embedDeltas={""100"":695,""200"":613,""300"":544,""400"":544,""500"":525,""700"":500,""800"":500,""900"":500,""1000"":500},window.datawrapper[""SXOv6""].iframe=document.getElementById(""datawrapper-chart-SXOv6""),window.datawrapper[""SXOv6""].iframe.style.height=window.datawrapper[""SXOv6""].embedDeltas[Math.min(1e3,Math.max(100*Math.floor(window.datawrapper[""SXOv6""].iframe.offsetWidth/100),100))]+""px"",window.addEventListener(""message"",function(a){if(""undefined""!=typeof a.data[""datawrapper-height""])for(var b in a.data[""datawrapper-height""])if(""SXOv6""==b)window.datawrapper[""SXOv6""].iframe.style.height=a.data[""datawrapper-height""][b]+""px""});Indeed, it was a poor month for DOGE in terms of percent change, but with 22 of the top 25 world’s largest cryptocurrencies reporting losses over the course of October, DOGE’s performance wasn’t unique.Monthly performanceMonthly performance: -36 percentAll-time high: $0.017Closing price on October 31: $0.003764Rank as per market capitalization: 23DOGE was in a slow but steady decline since the month began at a price of $0.0058, until it concluded at a 36 percent lower price of $0.003764. From open to close, October was DOGE’s worst-performing month since last March, when it fell 52 percent. In terms of monthly trading volume, October’s $403 billion was just 30 percent of the prior month’s volume of $1.2 billion and its lowest since July, according to data from CoinMarketCap.On August 31, DOGE’s price broke bullish out of a falling wedge (bullish reversal pattern) which set the stage for its latest “boom” cycle. As with all of DOGE’s boom cycles, though, it eventually topped out on Sept. 10 at the price of $0.007, according to data from Poloniex, and the price began its descent thereafter. Using the Fibonacci retracement tool by connecting the low of $0.0023 on Aug. 14 to its $0.007 peak, it can be seen that price is hovering near the golden ratio of 0.618 retracement, which may offer support for a temporary up move. That said, the price has found acceptance below the 200-day EMA, so a sustained rally will not come easily. Coincidentally, the 0.618 Fibonacci is located at the same price level as the high of DOGE’s previous bull cycles, $0.0041. Resistance tends to flip to support once it’s broken, which bodes well for the immediate price action of DOGE. What’s more, the relative strength index (RSI) is approaching oversold territory, meaning sellers could lose strength in the near-term. The moving average convergence and divergence indicator (MACD) is echoing similar sentiments and the short-term bullish case would strengthen if the indicators produce a bullish crossover in the next few days. It should be noted that DOGE tends to retrace significantly after a strong incline, sometimes beyond 100 percent, so history would suggest that it’s unlikely that the price holds its current level for too long. If the daily Guppy Multiple Moving Average indicator (GMMA) flips red, it will likely confirm there is more downside action ahead for DOGE, in which case the next Fibonacci retracement of 0.786 near the price level $0.0030 could be looked to for support.

Yet, entrepreneurs appear to be betting that between now and that bright future, a small fortune might be waiting.Already, several mining companies have invested millions in building specialized mining chips for ethereum, machinery that will only function as long as the network pays out new cryptocurrency to those who dedicate computing hardware to the effort.One such investor is Chen Min, CEO and founder of Linzhi, a Shenzhen-based, startup that has spent $4 million in pursuit of designing the fastest specialized mining chip, or ASIC, for ethereum. An industry veteran, Chen was previously the lead ASIC designer at Canaan Creative, one of three (largely bitcoin-focused) mining firms that have dominated the production of crypto hardware over the last decade.However, she’s since departed to try her hand in making machinery for ethereum, already investing amply in the goal.“The cost to get to first silicon and sample machines is roughly $4 million. Additionally we have our ongoing cost of operations, salaries, office, which are all modest, lean and efficient,” Chen said.Announced in September, Linzhi’s ASIC promises to overtake previous ethereum ASIC designs, featuring high improvements to energy efficiency and computing power. Still, the mining chip will only function on ethereum if the blockchain keeps its current code-base.But Chen isn’t too concerned.“I don’t know if [ethereum] will or will not switch to proof-of-stake,” she told CoinDesk. “Proof-of-stake has a lot of problems.”Evidence exists that Linzhi isn’t alone in this position. As detailed in CoinDesk, mining giant Bitmain released its ethereum miner, the Antminer E3, back in March, while Innosocilion announced three ethereum miners in July.While Chen recognizes the inherent risk of introducing an ASIC in such an unpredictable environment, she told CoinDesk:“The information is open, we are not hiding that risk. Our customer can decide to buy or not.”Also backing Chen’s conviction is the idea that proof-of-work is simply a better system for managing the distribution of cryptocurrency rewards. In this way, Chen described a possible proof-of-stake switch as “not a smart thing.”“There are so many people, so many users, developers and hardware invested in that coin. If they ignore the work that has been done and switch to proof-of-stake, maybe later they can also ignore your stake and switch to proof-of-some other idea,” Chen said.But there’s other risks facing ASIC mining on ethereum as well.At a core developer call last week, the engineers behind ProgPoW – a proposal that would change the code to only allow GPU miners as an alternative to ASICs were in attendance. Though still in the proposal stage, if executed, ProgPoW would effectively disable ASICs from mining on ethereum – and momentum is building toward the implementation.Chen, however, argued that such ideas are little more than knee-jerk reactions, ones that don’t actually provide solutions to some of the concerns about how ether rewards are distributed in the community at large.“ProgPoW is being pushed by large farms that have not disclosed their real intentions,” Chen said, adding:“The fear of Bitmain is driving the [ethereum] community into the arms of some very powerful well-funded farms that they don’t even know about.”Kristy-Leigh Minehan, a leading developer behind the ProgPoW switch, pushed back against this claim, arguing that “large-scale GPU farms don’t really exist.” In a sense, Minehan is making the case that GPUs can promote a larger number of participants in securing ethereum, something she argues ASICs, due to their cost and operational requirements, cannot.More broadly, the push for ProgPoW is typical of what has been termed crypto’s “war on miners,” in which several cryptocurrencies have moved to remove ASIC hardware manufacturers from their respective networks.Yet according to Chen, much of the conversation about removing ASICs from ethereum lacks an awareness of the kind of advantages specialized hardware can bring to a cryptocurrency project.“Our chip is optimized, specialized for ethereum, not only for mining, but also for verification and node operation, so I’m very curious about why people think it is wrong,” Chen told CoinDesk.Chen added that specialized hardware is often condemned on moral, not rational, scientific grounds.Pointing to scaling challenges faced by ethereum, Chen theorized that advancements in mining hardware could even help ethereum overcome its current concerns about scaling to more people and more transactions.“[Ethereum] is still so far away from the traditional banking system. I think hardware can contribute,” she said.In her mind, because ASICs will be able to mine ethereum faster and more efficiently, they will be able to process more transactions at a faster pace. “If we have a fast enough physical layer,” the community won’t have to rely on complex software scaling solutions, such as sharding, she argued.Chen depicted Linzhi as deeply interested in participating in and assisting with the improvement of the ethereum protocol.Indeed, pointing to a recent proposal by ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin that offers a scaling method based on hardware running zk-snarks, Chen said that Linzhi would be capable of producing such hardware in the future, although it’s not on their roadmap.All in all, it’s the latest sign that a larger argument is being had about how ethereum will secure its $22 billion blockchain. However, that argument may not break from the original roadmap anytime soon.Speaking to CoinDesk, Hudson Jameson, a communications officers for the Ethereum Foundation, said he was unaware of any ASIC advocates in the ethereum developer community who might protest the plan to switch to proof-of-stake.Much of the movement stems from the idea that the presence of ASICs optimized to only run one particular algorithm could interfere with a smooth transition to proof-of-stake, now dubbed “Shasper” due to its fusion with scaling method, sharding.“That’s the entire reason ProgPoW was created: to ensure [ethereum] could transition safely over to [proof-of-stake] without larger parties like Bitmain manipulating the coin and the price,” Minehan told CoinDesk.Still, Chen didn’t express too much concern in this regard, emphasizing that such efforts are still very much within “the proposal state.”Irrespective, Chen urged that in the event of ProgPoW or proof-of-stake, Linzhi will switch to mining ethereum classic, a rival ethereum platform that split away from the blockchain in 2016, and that traditionally been more friendly to ASIC hardware.She told CoinDesk:“We would like to reduce the power consumed to secure [ethereum], but if they want to stick with wasteful GPUs run by two companies and powerful secret farming concerns, then we will just press on with [ethereum classic].”Database image via Shutterstock"

On the other hand, though, non-transferable utility tokens should not, it says.For a third category, “asset tokens” – which are used to “prefinance a new business project” and may act as commodities or securities – the SMSG said it would need to be determined if a token is either a financial instrument (for MiFID purposes and the Market Abuse Regulation) or a transferable security (for purposes of Prospectus Regulation).If an asset token gives the right to a financial entitlement, it has features of either bonds or shares, according to the report. Further, if transferable, an asset token shares “important characteristics with transferable securities under MiFID, and are therefore subject to MiFID II and the Prospectus Regulation.”The SMSG said the ESMA should clarify the MiFID definition of “transferable security” in guidelines, as well as clarify whether transferable asset tokens that give right to a financial entitlement should be considered as MiFID transferable securities.If an asset token is non-transferable, the SMSG said it sees “no need” for regulation.The report also comes out in favor of the creation of national sandboxes and innovation hubs for token-based startups. However, it suggested that the ESMA should ensure “sufficient quality, transparency and legal security of national initiatives.”The advisory follows reports in early October that the ESMA was considering whether to regulate initial coin offering (ICO) tokens as securities on a case-by-case basis.EU flags image via Shutterstock"

BAT was able to reach a 3-month high of $0.45 just 11 days later. Yet as of press time, BAT is trading at around $0.30, representing a 23 percent decline from than yesterday’s high of $0.39.  As can be seen in the above chart, the price of BAT broke above its upper Bollinger Band and hit a three-month high of $0.39 following the Coinbase listing news, though it quickly retreated. In technical analysis, a price extending above its Bollinger Band is usually a sign of overextension. When combined with an overbought relative strength index (RSI), a pullback becomes more likely as a result.Given yesterday’s bearish candle close, it’s possible that BAT’s descent is not complete. The middle of the Bollinger Band – known as the basis (middle red-line) – can now be looked to for short-term support. Falling below the basis would set scope for a further drop to the bottom Bollinger Band where support confluence with the 0.618 Fibonacci lies near $0.22. It’s worth noting BAT’s bearish reaction from the market, following its listing on Coinbase, is not the first time a similar situation has taken place.ZRX and ETC were two other cryptocurrencies added to the exchange this year that were met with initial investor enthusiasm but fell shortly after their official listing on the exchange.ZRX became the most recent addition to Coinbase when it was listed on October 16th. Its price rose to an 8-week high of $1.09 the next day, but it began a steep descent thereafter. Today, ZRX is trading at a price of $0.72 on the Binance exchange, representing a 33 percent drop from its post-Coinbase listing high. In the frame below, the price action of ETC tells a similar story. The cryptocurrency hit a high of $15.09 on Aug.16, the day of its listing on Coinbase, but just a week later it was trading at a 20 percent lower price. Today, ETC is trading on Binance at a price of about $9.55, marking a 37 percent drop from its Aug. 16 high.

It added that the wallets’ contents represents a “small” fraction of its total assets, which also include undisclosed fiat holdings.Based on the provided addresses, Bitfinex holds at least 148,467 bitcoin, 1.7 million ether, and over 35 million EOS. These cryptocurrencies are worth around $1.5 billion, based on data from CoinDesk’s price index and CoinMarketCap.Bitfinex’s rebuttal follows a recent article on Medium published on Saturday that claimed the exchange is no longer solvent and urged users to withdraw their assets.The author, who goes by the title “ProofofResearch” alleged that Bitfinex made “a concerted effort” to censor a number of posts on a sub-reddit that it moderates in which users reported issues with fund withdrawals for at least a month.However, in its response, Bitfinex claims that “both fiat and cryptocurrency withdrawals are functioning as normal,” adding:“Verified Bitfinex users can freely withdraw Euros, Japanese Yen, Pounds Sterling and U.S. Dollars.

In January, both Bitfinex and Tether were reportedly subpoenaed by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.Months later, amid complaints over lack of transparency, the company published a report – via a law firm, instead of an auditing firm – which claimed the company had $2.55 billion in U.S. dollar reserves to back $2.54 billion-worth of USDT that were circulating on June 1.However, as CoinDesk pointed out after reviewing the document, it only covered one point in time and did not provide proof of its level of collateralization for other periods.Bitfinex image Shutterstock"

the famed cryptographer has been sleuthing around cryptocurrency ...","Sep 20, 2018 at 00:30 UTC",One of the founders of the cypherpunk movement has just revealed new technology that he believes will revolutionize cryptocurrency from this moment on.,"Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, the grey-haired, digital money pioneer David Chaum is launching a new cryptocurrency Elixxir via his startup.And his goals are bold. By using cryptographic techniques he invented decades ago, he believes he’s “reinvented” cryptocurrency, fixing fundamental problems plaguing the emerging technology, including speed, privacy, scalability and – one that perhaps doesn’t get quite as much attention – resistance to future disasters.Even further, he thinks solving these problems will take blockchain “mainstream.”One of the most influential digital money pioneers leading up to bitcoin, the famed cryptographer has been sleuthing around cryptocurrency conferences recently – dropping hints here and there – sparking theories about what exactly he’s been up to.What he found, though, were many problems with the tech.Not least of all that it takes upwards of an hour to send a secure payment, which is not at all competitive with PayPal, Visa or other major digital payment systems.“Yeah, it’s not really suitable for widespread use,” Chaum told CoinDesk.But using his more than 30 years of experience working with cryptography and payments, including developing anonymous digital money eCash before even the internet existed, he thinks he’s found a new way to solve these problems.“I think we can shoot these problems dead,” Chaum told CoinDesk, adding:“It’s no bullshit. We have code running in our lab.”The cryptographer claims to have made two blockchain breakthroughs.One is to change digital signatures, a crucial cryptographic component of cryptocurrency, used to verify whether someone owns the cryptocurrency they say they do.According to Chaum, the way digital signatures are computed in most cryptocurrencies today is just a hassle. These signatures are just too computationally expensive as is, Chaum contends.“There’s no way we can get speed and scalability if for every transaction a server has to do a public key operation like making a signature or checking a signature,” he said.So, Elixxir changes it up a bit.“We can cheat a little bit,” Chaum said.Arguing that the system could carry out these public key operations “in advance,” Chaum explained that by doing this, Elixxir is no less than a thousand times faster than any other blockchain.“It’s a breakthrough. No one else does anything like it,” he added.The public key cryptography used in Elixxir has another impact as well – it futureproofs the cryptocurrency for the era of quantum computers. Currently, most cryptocurrencies architecture leaves them vulnerable to quantum computers.And while this technology is likely still a long way from release, Chaum thinks this is such an important notion that he argues governments should be spending time on making sure digital money is quantum resistant.Then there’s the privacy of Elixxir – arguably Chaum’s forte, as he’s known as the “father of online anonymity.”Within the Elixxir architecture, Chaum believes “true privacy” can be achieved through so-called “multi-party computations” – a term he coined decades ago and a feature that’s used for enhanced privacy in cryptocurrency projects like Zcash and Enigma.The gist of the system is that a bunch of developers or nodes are involved in a cryptocurrency computation, but only one person needs to be honest in order for the computation to work and for the data to stay private.Elixxir uses this idea in a novel way. The nodes on the network, called “Mixnodes,” produce a multi-party computation for every block of transactions.Chaum compares this process to a group of people sitting around a card table. Each cuts the deck and shuffles, passing it to the next person. Say three of them are card sharks who know how to shuffle in a way that helps them to determine the location of the cards in the deck.But if just one of these people is honest and shuffles sufficiently, the card sharks, in the end, are “completely in the dark,” Chaum said.He continued:“Despite their best efforts to collude, and you know make notes of exactly what they do and everything, they are powerless against the one party that actually does what they’re supposed to.”And in this way, Elixxir privatizes transactions.What brought Chaum to build Elixxir was suspicion and apprehension about the state of the cryptocurrency industry today.“In this space, there are a lot of unfounded claims being made,” he told CoinDesk.“People bend the rules. They try to present things in a way that makes them look as good as possible,” Chaum continued, arguing many projects “gloss over” various technical issues that could break or undermine a project.Yet, there’s a similar skepticism on the part of crypto enthusiasts investigating Chaum’s promises. A notable example is when the pseudonymous cryptocurrency blogger WhalePanda dug up the Elixxir website prior to today’s announcement, expressing concerns about what he found.While Elixxir claims to boost privacy, WhalePanda argued that requiring participants to send their name and location in a “KYC form” runs counter to those goals.But with the technical brief now released, the broader community will be able to determine whether the breakthroughs are actually that, or whether there are bumps in the system.All in all, though, while the project is currently focused on payments, Chaum believes Elixxir could play an even bigger part in ensuring more people have control over their data online.“The bigger aim is to create the expectation of the broader public for fundamental human rights – digital rights in their ability to control all these aspects of their digital lives,” he told CoinDesk, concluding:“Cryptography is the only thing that can give power to the individual in the Information Age.”David Chaum image via Elixxir

Without specifying a date, the Kin Ecosystem Foundation said Wednesday that it would soon release a tool for kin holdings off of ethereum.Kik’s token has had several homes in its short life.The company raised just shy of $100 million in crypto during a September 2017 initial coin offering. By November, ethereum scaling issues resulted in talk that kin could find its way onto an alternative blockchain – something that Kik founder and CEO Ted Livingston later confirmed that December.By March, Kik had developed a two-chain strategy slated for stellar, with ethereum for security and stellar for speed; the plan was that users could switch back and forth.Then, in May, Kik determined that even stellar’s extremely low transaction fees were too much at scale, so it decided to fork stellar so it could eliminate transaction costs entirely. Kik’s Ory Band recently gave a talk on the advantages to kin with pursuing a federated consensus model.Now, Kik is breaking away from ethereum entirely.Reiterating his goal to make kin the most used cryptocurrency in the world, Livingston said in a release:“One Kin on one blockchain. That’s our vision, and our strategy continues evolving as we work toward building an infrastructure that supports this.”Kik isn’t the first company to start building on ethereum only shift away to alternative platforms. Indeed, ethereum has served as an incubation hub of sorts for a number of tokens that later broke away.For example, EOS and Tron both migrated their tokens off the original blockchain that made their fundraising possible.For the Kin Foundation, the network’s limitations hit home especially hard when some of its early network testing in December became impossible due to the growing activity around the CryptoKitties app.The matter has since become more urgent as the team rolls out new mobile products designed to give users ways to both earn and spend kin.A spokesperson for the Kin Foundation explained that it has been making arrangements with exchanges, ensuring that as users move their tokens onto exchanges, they will make a one-way move onto the kin blockchain – burning the original ERC-20 token in the process.There’s no deadline for users to make the move, however. The spokesperson said that existing users can sit on their tokens on ethereum as long as they like.Social networks image via Shutterstock"

However, vigilant monitoring is needed in light of the speed of market developments. Should the use of crypto-assets continue to evolve, it could have implications for financial stability in the future.”The report states that, should crypto-assets continue to gain in popularity, it might impact financial stability by having an effect on investor confidence.Other risks arise from the potential for crypto assets to be used as a form of payment or settlement, the report continues.While advocating for close monitoring of crypto assets and their potential risk, the FSB notes that this is difficult, at least in part, because there is not a lot of information available on the full impact they can have.Crypto assets have an impact outside financial stability as well, the report continues, raising question about policy issues including consumer and investor protection, market integrity, anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT), tax evasion, capital controls circumvention and illegal securities offerings.However, while important, the organization states that these issues are outside its primary focus, and “are the subject of work at national and international levels.”Global currencies board image via Shutterstock"

2014 to buy bitcoin, after which its price dropped from $600 to $200.","Sep 19, 2018 at 13:25 UTC",One of the world’s largest crypto exchanges by trading volume wants to set up fiat-to-crypto trading platforms on almost every continent.,"Binance founder and CEO Zhao Changpeng closed out the first day of CoinDesk’s Consensus Singapore event with a fireside chat, where he discussed a range of topics, including how he grew Binance from a startup with a $15 million initial coin offering to one of the world’s largest crypto exchanges and his future vision for the platform.During the conversation with CoinDesk’s Pete Rizzo, Zhao indicated that by this time next year, he wants the company to launch five to 10 fiat-to-crypto exchanges, with ideally two per continent.These plans falls in line with Binance’s current efforts to roll out an exchange in Singapore that supports local fiat-to-crypto trading services.Having conducted closed testing on Tuesday, CZ said he hopes the platform could be up and running within months, though he added that working with banks and regulators is much harder than just with cryptocurrencies.Noting that this move appears to be a reversal to what Binance has been known for, which is its crypto-to-crypto trading, Zhao admitted that the crypto market capitalization is still significantly lower than traditional financial instruments.“Fiat is still where all the money is in. … And we’ve got to open that gate,” he said.Zhao added that in order to so, Binance plans to continue working with relatively smaller countries, citing recent partnerships with nations like Malta. The main reason, he explained, is that these countries tend to respond in a much more efficient way.“You can access to the top-level government officials and they respond to your questions more directly and efficiently. … And they do appreciate the investment you are bringing into the local economy,” he said.That said, Zhao brands this move as more of finding a sweet spot rather than an entire pivot, stating that in the long term, the goal is still to build a decentralized exchange when the technology matures.The fiat-to-crypto plan also comes as Binance has recorded healthy businesses incomes over the past year despite the overall cryptocurrency market downturn.During the fireside chat, Zhao confirmed that in the first quarter this year, Binance made $200 million in profits, although the assets are all in cryptos. He added that the profits in Q2 declined due to a market drop, with $150 million.Commenting on Binance’s rapid growth, Zhao said luck played some role in the company’s success so far as it was established with the “right thing at the right time.”After quitting from OKCoin in 2015, Zhao said he spent the next two years with a team building a cloud-based system that offers crypto exchanges the infrastructure to form their own platforms, a technology he said laid the foundation of the creation of Binance.And two years later, the exchange went online at a time when the Chinese government was stepping up its scrutiny over crypto trading and eventually issued the ban on domestic initial coin offerings and fiat-to-crypto trading.“Sometimes negative things could turn out to be positive in the long term if you leverage it right,” he said.Asked if he was concerned about whether market volatility would significantly affect Binance’s business, Zhao responded that he sold his house in 2014 to buy bitcoin, after which its price dropped from $600 to $200. Despite the fall, he he didn’t sell, adding: “After that, I’m just not that worried.”Zhao Changpeng image via CoinDesk"

Casey is the chairman of CoinDesk’s advisory board and a senior advisor for blockchain research at MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative.,"The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers.Cash appears to be disappearing from China’s teeming cities.Foreign tourists talk of struggling to buy things because they don’t have Alipay or WeChat Pay installed on their smartphones and because merchants no longer bother to accept the banknotes they get from ATMs.These stories elicit fascination among Americans, but not much more. Here in the U.S., many can’t grasp what the big deal is about digital payments. After all, pulling a credit card from your wallet isn’t much more inconvenient than pulling a smartphone out of your pocket and it costs you – if not the merchant – no more than if you used cash. To the average American, China’s system seems no different from Venmo or Paypal, just more pervasive.But as Andreessen Horowitz partner Connie Chan told me during a fireside chat at the HYTSA conference at Stanford a week ago, the real benefits of China’s cashless revolution lie in how this new, software-based system of value exchange has become a platform on which new business models can be built.Digitizing payments in this way, at very low cost, enables micropayments and seamless integration across different service providers, which in turn means merchants can provide a variety of new services to customers over an app. This helps to enhance the user’ experience, boost loyalty and engagement, and build network value.Consider how Kuguo, the most popular of a number of Chinese music apps, provides “song coins” to fans, based on their level of engagement, which they can exchange into renminbi, the local currency.Essentially, by removing intermediation costs from the payments system, Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial’s Alipay and Tencent’s WeChat Pay – which together now boast a billion users, according to Aite Group – have created a seamless foundation for a whole new digital economy. Chan says this is where U.S. app developers are being left behind, because their products can’t integrate with this new model.The relevance in this for CoinDesk readers, with their interest in cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, starts with the fact that this dream of a seamless, micropayments-enabled system of hitherto impossible new services is one that’s often cited by crypto enthusiasts.So, does China prove that you don’t need a blockchain to build a new Internet of Value, powered by device-to-device exchanges in an Internet of Things economy?Well, yes, and, no.There is a very real and illuminating limit to China’s system: It can’t easily go outside its borders.Although some U.S.-based providers are now creating services for Chinese tourists so they can buy things in America with their WeChat Pay or Alipay accounts, most of the activity on these networks happens in China. Most importantly, while Alipay and WeChat Pay are trying to crack other markets, there is no cross-currency facility. For all intents and purposes, this “cashless revolution” is happening within the boundaries of a renminbi universe.The reason for that is that unlike cryptocurrency systems, the Chinese digital payments system is entirely built on the rails of the Chinese banking system, which deals almost exclusively in the Chinese currency. In that sense, it does share a foundation more like Venmo’s and Paypal’s, whose accounts also settle back into the banking system, than that of bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies.The big difference is that for a host of reasons, the banks don’t charge the same kind of exorbitant interchange fees to Chinese merchants that U.S. banks do to U.S. businesses, allowing the digital payments providers to build a much more fluid micropayments model on top.But here’s the thing: the Chinese banking system is essentially an instrument of Chinese policymaking. The four biggest banks make up the bulk of the financial system and are all majority government-owned. Their capacity to make profits, essentially on the spread they charge for loans over what they pay for deposits, is enabled by a carefully managed monetary policy. The People’s Bank of China sets a ceiling for deposit rates – often below inflation – and can get away with that because it imposes capital controls on savers to prevent them fleeing low rates for higher-earning currencies.To be sure, Ant Financial and Tencent both have a variety of financial and banking licenses of their own. But their own financial profits are very much enabled by the same interest rate policy framework that a wider state-run Chinese banking system is compelled to accept.For now, that policy framework has sustained a quid pro quo arrangement with Chinese savers, who more or less support a banking system that otherwise eats into their savings because the benefits are manifest in continued economic growth and in services like those of Tencent and Alibaba.But for some time, there has been an expectation that China, in its desire to “internationalize” the renminbi, will relax both its interest rate and capital controls, which could seriously undermine banks’ profit margins. If China were also to allow more private and foreign investment into the banks, would those institutions continue to subsidize the digital payments economy? Maybe, maybe not.The bigger point is that China’s circumstances are unique. There aren’t many governments, if any, that could get away with this kind of control over the banking system. Others have tried – such as Venezuela and Argentina – and have destroyed confidence in their currencies in the process.So, if the rest of the world can’t use compliant banks to subsidize a fluid, digital payments system, what instead will it use as the platform?The answer may well lie in cryptocurrency and blockchain-based protocols. And as the race to build a stablecoin proceeds, a foundation for something that could viably compete with China’s model may emerge. It might even go one step better, as it would allow for cross-border payments.As U.S. government officials look nervously across the Pacific at China’s growing economic clout, rather than launching destructive trade wars that do nothing but prop up outdated, 20th-century industries, they should instead be figuring out how to emulate and compete with China’s new Internet of Value model for business development and innovation.It’s in that context that they should be looking at cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology less as a threat and more as an opportunity.Cashless payments in China image via Shutterstock"

For instance, it said, some crypto firms are moving their projects overseas and using agents to invest on behalf of investors from China.Other projects are not issuing tokens in public to directly raise funds, but are rather giving away free tokens while reserving a part of the total supply. These firms then try to use speculation in the secondary market to jack up these tokens’ prices in order to reap profits, the bank added.Giving the statistics, the bank said, there were 65 completed ICOs in China up until July 18, 2017, only five of which were completed prior to 2017. Further, it adds, over 105,000 people participated in the sales, providing total funding of about 2.6 billion yuan ($377.3 million), accounting for more than 20 percent of the sum raised globally in the same period.The central bank said that it needs to remain highly vigilant and to coordinate with other agencies to monitor the crypto industry in order to educate and protect investors.The PBoC has been taking measures against to block token fundraising since September 2017, when it outright banned ICOs. In June of this year, a vice governor of the PBoC issued strong statements against “disguised” ICOs and restated that crypto asset trading is illegal in the country.Then, in August, the China National Internet Finance Association (NIFA), a self-regulatory organization founded by the PBoC, added a “token sales” category to its platform so that public can report on potentially illegal ICOs.PBoC image via Shutterstock"

The results were analyzed and published in the State of Blockchain Q1 2017. In this piece, the original author reflects on some of the core findings.The most striking survey response was also the most straightforward to understand: sentiment around the ‘overall state’ of bitcoin and ethereum.Less than 5 percent of those surveyed in Q1 2017 felt even slightly negative about the overall state of ethereum. The sentiment and optimism could have hardly been any higher.At the time, the number of transactions on the ethereum network was rising.Transactions on the bitcoin network were rising as well, but the magnitude of growth was less dramatic, and bitcoin blocks had started to average over 90 percent capacity.Demand for bitcoin block space lead transaction fees to average north of $1 for the first time ever while ethereum’s fees averaged less than $0.05.It was clear that transaction fees were a large component of the negativity that survey participants felt when asked about bitcoin.In the 18 months since, we’ve seen the rollout and initial usage of both SegWit and Lightning Network to help address bitcoin scaling, but the block limit kept the on-chain transaction count bounded under about 400,000 per day. Without the same limitations, we saw ethereum’s transactional count exceed 1m per day in late 2017.During that period, we saw ethereum’s average transaction fee exceed $1, but also watched bitcoin’s pass $50.When block space is abundant and transaction fees are low, high transaction counts are easy to achieve, useful or not (similar to concerns around trading volumes on zero-fee exchanges).Analysis has now been done that claims that one mixing system comprised over 60 percent of all ETH transaction volume between February 2017 and February 2018.Ethereum had the largest ICO to date in July 2014 and the genesis block was created a year later in July 2015.In the year between the ICO and mainnet launch, many projects were experimenting with creating early dapps, including Augur, launching a smart contract on the ethereum test net in April 2015.Many in the community loved the idea of a decentralized prediction market, and in late 2015, Augur used the ICO model to raise $5 million to continue to build out their platform. The Augur ICO was for REP, a token which allows holders to act as oracles to settle markets after the fact in exchange for a percentage of the total amount bet.Users do not have to own REP and can bet in ETH, a more interesting token design for REP in my opinion than an approach some dapps have taken by introducing a new required currency within their ecosystem.By Q1 2017, hundreds of dapp ideas and token mechanisms that are irrefutably worse had been funded, and soon venture capitalists had been replaced by the global retail public via ICOs as the preferred and dominant form of early stage fundraising in crypto.The community was clearly enthusiastic and willing to fund any new decentralized, tokenized attempt to compete with existing industries and companies.Not only were participants optimistic about the future of Ethereum and its dapp ecosystem, but they also claimed to very positive about their current state.I believe Augur is great example of the chasm that has become more clear between expectations and reality. As stated, Augur launched an early, test version of their product before Ethereum actually launched. Augur’s actual launch just happened just 3 months ago in July 2018, over 3 years later. In the last 24 hours, Augur has had less than 50 users, 106 transactions, and about $10,000 in volume.At dapp number 48 out of 970 when ranked by users, Augur’s minimal usage metrics are not an outlier among ethereum dapps. The top used Ethereum dapps remain decentralized exchanges and games and no dapps had over 2,000 users or 10,000 transactions within the last 24 hours.Despite new dapps launching, global dapp activity has remained relatively flat over the last year, never exceeding 50,000 users.When comparing the usage of dapps across platforms, you can quickly find alternative ecosystems like EOS that are currently displaying more usage than ethereum. The weaknesses in comparing dapp metrics across platforms like ethereum and EOS have many parallels to the comparisons made earlier between transaction counts across bitcoin and ethereum.Since inception, one of the most critical, protocol level events on the Ethereum roadmap has been the shift from a Proof of Work consensus and security model to Proof of Stake. In June 2016, Vitalik predicted this shift would occur in early 2017.Data sourceIn Q1 2017, Casper was not live, but the community was quite optimistic it would at least be live by today.Eighty-three percent were wrong, it’s now Q4 2018 and proof-of-stake is not live on Ethereum. Casper research remains ongoing.Bitcoin, ethereum, and nearly every blockchain project is researching scaling the network through layer-two networks. In Q1 2017, 87 percent of the community thought that Raiden would be live on ethereum by the end of 2018, while 69% thought Lightning would be live on bitcoin.Bitcoin now has over 10,000 Lightning channels, while Raiden is not live on Eehereum’s main net (and now has a token, RDN, which had an ICO). Ethereum dapps including Funfair and Spankchain have however built dapp-specific scaling solutions and research on generalized state channels is ongoing by several parties.In many of the easiest ways to measure however, participants were largely right to be bullish.After the price of ETH spent much of 2016 above $10, the price of ether was back under $10 in Q1 2017 and global Google search interest was down following the chaos of The DAO and ETC.If you had bought ETH (with dollars) at any point between the ICO and mid-January 2018, you would have had a profitable trade (if you sold at the top). If you bought in the ICO (at $0.31), you would have returned 451,500 percent (better than equity in Coinbase today at a $8 billion valuation compared to its $4 million seed round, and ETH with public market liquidity).ETH has undoubtedly been a historic investment opportunity. Compared to many traditional and even crypto asset alternatives, it has often outperformed.On many time scales however, including in 2018’s bear market (2014’s which it wasn’t around to experience), it has actually severely underperformed.Both holding $ (as many ICO treasuries now realize they should have done) or even BTC would have been vastly superior strategies in 2018.Ethereum has clearly fallen short of technical expectations over the last 18 months.In all reality, the bar of expectations was simply set far too high by un-savvy retail investors with dollars and tokens in their eyes. The Q2 2017 survey article alluding to the inevitable pop that Spongebob saw coming from stupid inflated tokens was also simply bound to happen.Perhaps we should be thankful it happened quickly within the last 18 months and now we can enter a period like 2014 and 2015 where there is more focus on building than trading (or at a minimum it can help filter out the good traders from those who good lucky with ‘diversified exposure’ in a bull market).Much like bitcoin companies benefited from the building heavy period of 2014 and 2015, hopefully ethereum and its dapps can benefit heavily in the coming years from the tech built in 2018’s bear market. Hopefully the price depreciation and forthcoming ICO regulatory actions will further help shape the design of the next wave of projects, fundraisers, and token mechanisms.To see the contrast between Q1 2017 sentiment and today, help CoinDesk Research by taking the Q3 2018 sentiment survey.Disclaimer: The author has short exposure to ether, with rationale described in this thesis.

Investors can purchase the token, which is built on bitcoin, to essentially invest in all 10 cryptocurrencies at once, according to a press release.This grants retail investors access to “nearly 80 percent of the cryptocurrency market” at once, the release stated.Abra CEO Bill Barhydt told CoinDesk that at present, the fund invests in bitcoin, ethereum, XRP, bitcoin cash, EOS, stellar, litecoin, dash, monero and zcash.Users can deposit bitcoin, litecoin, bitcoin cash or a fiat currency into their Abra wallets and convert funds to the Bit10 token, he added.The token itself is not a fund, he explained, adding:“The Bit10 token is 100 percent bitcoin based. It is a single bitcoin collateralized multi-sig wallet. The amount of bitcoin the consumer is holding in the Bit10 token’s wallet is automatically adjusted to reflect the USD value of the Bit10 index. Abra is the counterparty to the contract and hedges away counterparty risk on all of its contracts. This is exactly how all of the other synthetic assets in Abra function.”The token works by using smart contracts to peg a user’s cryptocurrency or fiat currency holdings to Bit10. Bit10’s price will, in turn, move with the performance of those coins.While the token is built on Bitwise’s index fund, it is not an exchange-traded fund (ETF), an Abra representative said. However, the token is similar to an ETF in its ability to grant investors exposure to an index.That being said, Bitwise does intend to offer an ETF based on its cryptocurrency index fund, as previously reported. At the time, the company said it was looking for approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).Because the Bit10 token is not an actual ETF, it does not require approval through the SEC, the Abra spokesperson told CoinDesk.Barhydt explained that “the Abra BIT10 token uses the same synthetic asset model as all of the other Abra tokens available in our app. The tokens are held in fully collateralized bitcoin multi sig wallets with the user holding their own keys. As such the BIT10 token is not a security.”Quoits image via Shutterstock"

Specifically, according to Temco’s website, vendors can track the movements of products from distribution to eventual consumption on a blockchain, and then share the data as well.“Temco is more than prepared to disrupt contemporary supply chain process,” Jong Hyun Kim, the fintech investment board member of KIP, stated in the official press release, adding:“Not only does Temco exceed existing business solutions, but also is a prime example of the potential of blockchain technology.”KIP is widely regarded for investing in major billion-dollar Korean enterprises such as the country’s largest web search engine, Naver, and Kakao, the operator of the country’s dominant mobile messaging app Kakao Talk.The news further signals a thawing of some resistance to the still-nascent blockchain industry, after domestic financial regulators in South Korea laid down strict restrictions for the sale and other operations of cryptocurrency about a year ago. Since then, there has been considerable renewed support for friendlier policies toward blockchain.For instance, in early August, the governor of Jeju province, Won Hee-ryong, proposed allowing South Korea’s Jeju Islands to become a so-called “free zone” for crypto startups that want to conduct initial coin offerings (ICOs).Plus last month, the South Korean government was reported to be investing over $880 million in 2019 to boost technological innovation in the country, with a portion of that fund going into developing blockchain technology for “data management security and boosting the sharing economy.”Korean money image via Shutterstock"

Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Sep 17, 2018 at 12:59 UTC",Institutional traders simply need better crypto tools.,"That’s the driving idea behind a union between Kenetic, a crypto firm based in Hong Kong, and Tora, a trading systems firm that already supplies order execution, portfolio management, risk assessment and compliance services for well-established asset classes. Announced today, both companies are teaming up to create Caspian, a project that has raised $16 million in funding via a token presale.Investors in the round include Kenetic, Galaxy Investment Partners, Octagon Strategy, Techemy Capital, Global Advisors and Bletchley Park, according to David Wills of Kenetic.Wills called Caspian “a frictionless on-ramp for crypto traders.”Continuing, Wills said Caspian was built out of a need – one he saw firsthand when he transitioned from running a trading desk at the hedge fund Och-Ziff to Kenetic. Instead of having all the tools at their disposal, Kenetic was hacking together ways of making reports and visualizations to share data with the compliance and risk teams.“When I joined Kenetic, and it was sort of early days of running the business, it became very clear that different parts of our business needed a proper system to run all those businesses successfully,” he told CoinDesk.Ari Paul of BlockTower Capital, a partner on the project, agreed. “Liquidity is fragmented across dozens of exchanges globally, each with their own quirky API connections. Professional trading software will facilitate greater liquidity in crypto assets,” he told CoinDesk in an email.Wills knew these products already existed in traditional finance but they just needed to be repurposed for crypto. And knowing the team at Tora from his prior career, he asked them for help. “We just sort of got the two management teams together and realized there was good culture fit,” Wills said. “They brought the trading system and we brought the connectivity to the crypto space.”While the market for initial coin offerings (ICOs) has cooled somewhat, the companies are still pursuing a public sale in early October, looking to raise $1.5 million to $2 million from its relatively large community following.“To be honest it’s more of a community building activity,” Wills said.
Still, the team at Caspian has been encouraged by the size of the client pipeline they could have. The token will be used to buy access to Caspian; users that pay in the token will get a discount over those that don’t.There will be one billion caspian tokens, which were created with the ethereum token standard ERC-20. Of those, 40 percent are available for the token sale, with 32 percent available in the reserve for various future uses. The rest will be set aside for staff, advisors and the like.According to Wills, some of the reserve could be sold later to fund building out a retail-friendly version of the service, or it could simply be put on the market to increase the supply available to existing users.In a slide deck, the company contends it’s already plugged in to 25 crypto exchanges, and offering a useable product to institutional clients.Speaking to that, Wills concluded:“We’re open for business.” UPDATE (17 September 14:05 ​UTC​​): A previous version of this story incorrectly indicated BlockTower was an investor in Caspian’s presale. Actually, it is a partner in the project. The article has also been corrected to indicate that Kenetic is based in Hong Kong, rather than Singapore.Trading charts image via Shutterstock"

The process carried forward in spite of the refusal to participate from some exchanges as well as then-Attorney General Eric Schneiderman’s resignation in May.The newly-released Virtual Markets Integrity Initiative report drew issue with a number of practices put in place by the exchanges, including methods for monitoring and preventing market manipulation.Indeed, the report states that several crypto trading platforms told the OAG that “it was impossible” to monitor or prevent market manipulation occurring on multiple platforms, meaning that exchanges are limited in their efforts to “police abusive activity.” While noting that exchanges like Gemini are seeking the ability to monitor more effectively, “some platforms do appear to be taking steps to improve surveillance.”“The industry has yet to implement serious market surveillance capacities, akin to those of traditional trading venues, to detect and punish suspicious trading activity,” the NYAG report contended. “A platform cannot take action to protect customers from market manipulation and other abuses if it is not aware of those practices in the first place.”The report also took aim at Kraken, which declined to participate and blasted the NYAG effort in a fiery public statement in April, stating:“The OAG could not review the practices and procedures of non-participating platforms (Binance, Gate.io, Huobi, and Kraken) concerning manipulative or abusive trading. However, the Kraken platform’s public response is alarming. In announcing the company’s decision not to participate in the Initiative, Kraken declared that market manipulation ‘doesn’t matter to most crypto traders,’ even while admitting that ‘scams are rampant” in the industry.'”The wide-ranging report covered a range of topics, including whether the exchanges in question are allowed to operate in New York – and if they are doing so even without permission.Notably, the report said that Binance, Gate.io and Kraken had been referred to the state’s Department of Financial Services after an investigation into whether those exchanges are operating in New York. A fourth exchange, Huobi, was also investigated but not referred.“The OAG investigated whether those platforms accepted trades from within New York State. Based on this investigation, the OAG referred Binance, Gate.io, and Kraken to the Department of Financial Services for potential violation of New York’s virtual currency regulations,” the report stated.The NYAG’s office found that some exchanges could quantify how much trading activity on their platforms came from their own operations. Circle said it was responsible for less than 1 percent of the trading volume on Poloniex while BitFlyer USA conducts roughly 10 percent of the trades on its platform.Notably, “Coinbase disclosed that almost 20 percent of executed volume on its platform was attributable to its own trading.”The report also noted that while most exchanges use know-your-customer procedures, Bitfinex and Tidex do not, “requiring little more than an email address to begin trading virtual currencies.” However, the report did not offer a comment on any legal issues this may cause.Business miniatures image via Shutterstock"

With fiat currency withdrawals and deposits impossible as a result, exchanges have moved to survive on crypto-to-crypto trading, but volumes have suffered.In response to the ban, various entities, including, exchanges, have filed several counter petitions with the Supreme Court (SC) in what has become a combined case.The last hearing saw the case postponed, though it is expected to resume soon.See the RBI’s RTI response on Scribd below (provided to CoinDesk by Naimish Sanghvi):Bitcoin and rupees image via Shutterstock "

We are developing a tool to automate the migration of funds in a way that allows users to minimize the impact on their privacy. We recommend that users wait for the release of this tool, if feasible.”No timeline was presented for when this tool may be released.Following the upgrade’s implementation, network data indicates that zcash’s hashrate briefly fell to 1.5 GH/s, lower than it has been in nearly three weeks.

Coinbase, Xapo, Digital Asset Holdings, Branch Banking and Trust Company, Noble Markets and ItBit all submitted statements saying they did not have any funds belonging to Shrem, while Poloniex (part of Circle Internet Financial) said it held $0.41 in bitcoin in an account belonging to Shrem, and Bittrex held roughly $4.44 combined in bitcoin and a fork currency called bitcoin gold.“After careful consideration, the Court denies plaintiff’s motion to confirm the order of attachment and therefore lifts the attachment currently in place, effective immediately,” Judge Rakoff wrote Thursday.“An opinion explaining the reasons for this ruling will issue in due course,” he added, though he did not provide a timeline for when that opinion may be issued. No further documents were publicly available as of press time.Brian Klein, an attorney representing Shrem, told CoinDesk via email that the ruling “is an important first step towards [Shrem’s] complete vindication.”“We are very pleased the judge ruled in [Shrem’s] favor, dissolving the $30 million-plus attachment order after he heard extensive argument from both sides earlier today,” he wrote.The matter is not ending, however: a separate filing indicates that the case will proceed to a jury trial on April 8, 2019.A case management plan notes that the parties to the case have until Nov. 15 to amend any pleadings, request documents and file any questions they may have.The plan further notes that expert witnesses must submit any legally mandated disclosures by February or March, depending on whether they intend to support a claim or oppose a claim, respectively.Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, as well as the Winklevoss Capital Fund, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The Winklevoss Capital Fund sued Shrem in September, alleging he withheld 5,000 bitcoin he was supposed to purchase on behalf of the Winklevoss brothers.

Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Nov 1, 2018 at 10:00 UTC","With its latest funding round, Coinbase, the cryptocurrency exchange turned Silicon Valley unicorn, is amassing a “war chest” for a “rainy day.”","At least, that’s how Coinbase’s vice president of corporate and business development, Emilie Choi, described the $300 million the company recently raised in a Series E round with investors such as Tiger Global Management and Polychain, the latter of which is headed by former Coinbase employee Olaf Carlson-Wee.“It was opportunistic,” Choi told CoinDesk Wednesday. “We didn’t need to raise it.”Speaking to why a company reportedly generating  $1.3 billion in annual revenue would continue to court venture capitalists, she added:“We want to have money for a rainy day, to be able to act on any opportunities that we think are going to be really important.”Namely, the leading opportunity that Choi sees is adding support for new assets across Coinbase platforms, eventually “thousands” of prospective cryptos.Beyond the Circle-issued stablecoin that Coinbase already supports, USDC, other fiat-pegged assets may also be under consideration.“With adding assets, stablecoins are a natural extension of that,” Choi said. “As we move towards this utility phase of crypto, we recognize that one of the big things holding users back from actually using crypto was the volatility of it. So a stablecoin helps pave the way for crypto to be more usable and more stable.”She added that diverse categories, such as stablecoins or privacy coins, will naturally emerge as Coinbase adds support for more assets. The company is already considering the privacy-centric asset zcash.When asked if Coinbase might someday list initial coin offerings (ICOs), tokens launched to fundraise for blockchain projects, Choi replied the company didn’t want to “close the door” to any opportunity down the road.“All the priorities right now are focused on adding assets, adding international rails, all that kind of stuff.” she said.Crypto veteran Arianna Simpson, founder and managing director of Autonomous Partners, described this raise as unusual, but not surprising.“Usually, when a company of this size raises, it’s because they aren’t profitable,” Simpson told CoinDesk, suggesting the extra funds could bolster the company’s global expansion. “[Coinbase] saw the opportunity to raise on favorable terms and they took it.”The exact total raised in this Series E is yet to be released; a second batch of investors is still processing paperwork and endowments.“This was the first tranche of the primary, we still have a few remaining investors who will do the second tranche,” Choi said. But “that [$300 million] will be the bulk of this round.”Venture capitalist Lasse Clausen, co-founder of the Berlin-based fund 1kx, told CoinDesk this raise was particularly impressive since Coinbase reportedly experienced a dramatic drop in active users over the last two quarters. Overall, the research firm Diar found Coinbase’s dollar volumes fell 80 percent since last year.“The revenue and active users of Coinbase have been tanking since December 2017,” Clausen said. “So the fact that the investors still deployed this large investment now shows how bullish they are on crypto in the medium and long-term.”That’s why Choi said Coinbase is raising now and playing “the long game.” The proceeds will also help fund international expansion, she said.“Certainly the U.K. has been a big focus for us. We’ll probably have more expansion and extension in the EU more broadly,” Choi said. “We’re definitely very bullish on Japan as the first Asian market that we really want to enter.”Indeed, Coinbase is hiring for several roles in the new London and Tokyo offices. As such, Choi said the Series E, which valued the company at a record $8 billion, will help it make competitive employment offers.Speaking to Coinbase’s aim to eventually raise funds through an initial public offering as well, albeit not any time soon, Choi added:“Whenever we feel ready to be a public company, we will do that.”Emilie Choi image via Coinbase"

In particular, the tool will look for potentially criminal or otherwise illicit activity.Binance’s chief financial officer, Wei Zhou, told CoinDesk that he hopes the move will “inspire” the crypto industry to take anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism financing measures seriously.“The ultimate goal of our partnership with Chainalysis is to create an environment in blockchain where everyone feels safe,” he said, explaining, “We believe the fight against money laundering to be collaborative and pro-active.”While the firm has already invested in know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) measures, and hired compliance professionals, he said:“Criminals are always looking to loopholes in the system, so we are continuously on the lookout for new technologies and methods to combat money laundering and malicious actors.”Chainalysis’ system works by using a combination of pattern recognition, proprietary algorithms and different open-source resources to process cryptocurrency services. If suspicious activity is detected during a transaction, the software will generate an alert.The tool can also help cryptocurrency companies to ease the process of opening bank accounts, due to its compliance with relevant KYC and AML laws, according to the release.Chainalysis co-founder and COO Jonathan Levin told CoinDesk that cryptocurrency market participants “must develop greater trust in the data and technology underlying our ecosystem” in order for the overall space to advance.“By working with industry leaders like Binance, we’re able to mold the foundation for credible and robust markets in all jurisdictions,” he said.Microscope image via Shutterstock"

Each partition, referred to potentially as a “subnet” by the patent, would store information about a specific type of currency or otherwise hold different types of information than the other subnets.Among financial companies, Mastercard has become a prolific filer of proposed patents, all developed around various use cases of the technology.For example, earlier this year, the firm scored a patent for a system that, as envisioned, would speed up cryptocurrency payments within a proposed system.Editorial credit: Alexander Yakimov / Shutterstock.com"

According to an update from the council Friday, a public hearing will now be held on Oct. 25 to determine whether to follow through with the proposal.The suggested zoning rules cover a variety of categories such as fire safety, heat, nuisance abatement and special use permits. If approved, crypto mining farm operators in the city would immediately be required to keep the ambient temperature inside their facilities within 120 degrees Fahrenheit (48.8 degrees Celsius) at any time.Should the average daily temperature outside the facilities be less than 40 degrees F (4.4 degrees C), mining farm operators must ensure that “no more than 20 percent of the heat dissipated by the mining activity shall be released directly to the outside.”The councilor further suggested enforcing a cap on noise generated by mining farms.“No mining operation should produce more than 90 decibels (dB) from a distance of 25 feet from the exterior of the containment structure, to avoid any adverse effects for the residents,” he detailed in the proposal.The suggested rules follow a decision made by the city in March to introduce an 18-month moratorium on new mining operations after residents raised concerns over increased electricity costs and other issues. Local officials suggested at the time the ban could be lifted sooner, if protections are put in place.Elsewhere in his proposal, McFarlin also pushed for a mandate that mining farm equipment must be “housed in an individually metered, electrically grounded and metal-encased structure,” adding:“All building requirements required by this section … shall be designed by a New York State licensed engineer and in accordance with all applicable codes and standards.”Mining rigs image via Shutterstock"

offense of reporting one test bitcoin swap transaction as a real 
transaction.","Nov 10, 2018 at 12:00 UTC","Richard Malish is General Counsel at NICE Actimize where he counsels on global anti-money laundering, fraud, trading compliance and banking regulatory matters.","The New York Attorney General (“NY AG”) recently issued a report on its fact-finding enquiries to multiple virtual currency trading platforms believed to be operating in New York. One of its many interesting findings was how virtual private networks (“VPNs”) may permit market manipulation.VPNs are a critical tool for privacy-minded cryptocurrency traders, as well as the only method for some traders to access these markets in countries such as China. Based on the NY AG’s report, should crypto exchanges assume that VPN access is no longer permissible?Not necessarily, but they need to look at the issue in the broader context of their overall compliance program.Stepping back, the NY AG’s focus on VPNs was in the context of the effectiveness of access controls to ensure fairness and integrity and protect customers. Access controls start with basic Know Your Customer (“KYC”) processes to confirm a new customer’s identity.While eight of the trading platforms which responded to the enquiry required customers to submit various forms of personal information and government-issued identification before trading, Bitfinex requires little more than an email address to trade between exchanges (as opposed to withdrawing/depositing fiat currency). Tidex, which states that it prohibits users from the United States and is currently filing with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) to become a money services business, requires only a name, email address and phone number.A common additional access control for online businesses is to monitor IP addresses of users to determine their approximate geographic location and track suspicious behavior coming from a particular computer connection. For example, transactions in multiple accounts coming from one IP address may be suspicious. Simultaneous access from IP addresses which are not in proximity could be a sign of fraud or a cyberattack.IP addresses can also be masked using VPNs which route connectivity through a third-party network. This permits an individual to feign residency in a different jurisdiction or open several accounts and pretend that they are not related. Companies which block VPN access, such as Netflix and Hulu, most likely are screening access against a known list of VPN servers. These controls are not fool-proof since VPN services often change server IP addresses to stay one step ahead (as those using VPN to access Facebook or crypto exchanges from China, where unlicensed VPNs are illegal, can validate).While most of the exchanges that responded to the NY AG reported that they monitor access by IP address, only two claimed to limit VPN access. The two exchanges, Bitstamp and Poloniex (now a part of Circle), have both withdrawn from various jurisdictions due to regulatory issues.In addition to making sure that IP addresses from New York are not provided access to unauthorized exchanges, the NY AG raised concern that crypto exchanges which neither require documentation to execute a trade nor take active measures to block access via VPN may not be able to address manipulative or abusive trading activity.For example, one individual may open up two accounts and engage in wash trades, which occur when traders buy and sell the same asset repeatedly to create the false appearance of market activity to move prices.Unfortunately, wash trades are believed to be common in crypto markets because exchanges are ranked based on trading volume.One report estimates over 7 of the top 10 exchanges engage in excessive wash trading from 12x to over 100x their true volume, and one is believed to inflate its trading 4,400x.VPN access can also pose risks from an anti-money laundering perspective. Virtual currency exchangers have been subject to the Bank Secrecy Act’s anti-money laundering requirements since as early as 2011. Failure to comply with KYC requirements can result in large penalties, such as the $700,000 fine assessed by FinCEN against Ripple Labs in 2015.The Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has also stated that it will treat digital currencies the same as fiat currencies, and sanctions violations carry strict liability which does not require intent to violate the law to be proven.FinCEN has been focused on IP addresses mentioned in suspicious activity reports (SARs) for many years. In 2014 the agency reported that an investigation of IP addresses mentioned in SARs found 975 hits for possible Tor network addresses, corresponding to reports totaling nearly $24 million in likely fraudulent activity.However, before the advent of cryptocurrencies, it was unlikely that FinCEN would expect the filing of a SAR just because of the use of different VPN addresses. Some banks have restricted VPN access to websites, but policies differ between firms.It will be interesting to see if the purely online nature of cryptocurrencies, and perhaps the growth of digital banks, will result in heightened U.S. regulatory scrutiny of VPNs. It appears unlikely that prescriptive federal VPN rules will be passed any time soon given the conservative approach taken by regulators such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) on more fundamental issues related to cryptocurrency.As of today the NY AG report ostensibly is only a platform to educate the public and provide a number of questions that consumers should ask to protect themselves when considering various exchanges. Although three of the four exchanges which failed to respond to the inquiry, Binance, Gate.io, and Kraken, were reported to the New York State Department of Financial Services (DFS) for potential violation of the state’s virtual currency regulations, it is unclear whether the NY AG report will encourage the DFS or other regulators to force digital currency exchanges to prohibit VPNs.Rather, cryptocurrency exchanges will most likely be forced to reckon with VPN access as part of any regulatory or law enforcement actions for market manipulation, which could come any day. The DFS in February 2018 already reminded virtual currency businesses to implement measures to deter market manipulation.And the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has reportedly been working with the CFTC on a criminal probe of possible market manipulation in crypto markets since at least the summer. The CFTC proved that it takes market manipulation related to cryptocurrency seriously as early as 2015 when it settled wash trade charges against TeraExchange for the fairly innocuous offense of reporting one test bitcoin swap transaction as a real transaction.Cryptocurrency exchanges operating in the U.S. or doing business with customers in the U.S. should promptly review their policies for verifying and monitoring authorized access.If your business desires to continue to permit masked VPN addresses, the decision should be made in consideration of other controls and the damage that market manipulation or anti-money laundering charges would have on your firm’s business. For example, facial recognition access controls might be considered as an alternative method to prevent one person trading across several accounts.However, if your exchange currently permits users to open multiple accounts, has no market manipulation policy or is actively encouraging market manipulation to increase your market cap rankings, VPN may only be a footnote in your eventual enforcement action.Mask image via Shutterstock"

For now, Treasury Management will only be accepting inbound transactions using the product.Birla said:“I think the important thing is this is not a test. Ripple only signs production clients, so they are taking this product into production. There’s no pilot, there’s no proof-of-concept – that’s already been done. They’ve committed to [transactions] with other customers.”Ripple’s SVP believes that small U.S. businesses signed onto RippleNet – the umbrella term for the firm’s several payment networks – would especially benefit from banking with PNC as a result of the new integration.“Providing instant payments instead of waiting two to three days, that sounds like a short time, [but] that’s two to three days without access to capital. Having that is a real game-changer,” he said.PNC apparently already has customers lined up to work with xCurrent initially, although Birla was not at liberty to provide any details on those firms.While the bank will start by using xCurrent, Birla hopes to ultimately help them begin working with Ripple’s xRapid platform as well, he said.“With PNC, the idea is to get a few corridors lit up with xCurrent … When they’re ready to start talking about emerging markets, we’ll introduce them to xRapid. We’re working to get them started with xCurrent so it’s not a completely new feature to move to xRapid,” he explained.More broadly, Ripple announced Wednesday that it has clients in 40 countries across six different continents now, having opened new payment corridors to parts of East and Southeast Asia, Africa, Europe and South America.Birla said it is “exciting” to see Ripple’s efforts begin to be be implemented, particularly in emerging and under-served markets.The executive also addressed reports suggesting Ripple’s xRapid product would be launched in the next month or so.“We haven’t officially announced a timeline. I think we’re really excited about xRapid, I personally am really excited about how our customers in the pilot phase of xRapid like the experience,” Birla said.PNC Bank image via Ken Wolter/Shutterstock"

This revolutionary technology will have an important impact on the club’s overall business strategy and the way we engage with our fanbase.”With the news, PSG follows other European soccer clubs into embracing the idea of blockchain and cryptocurrency.CoinDesk reported last month that seven major clubs in the U.K.’s Premier League including Newcastle United, Crystal Palace, and Leicester City inked a deal with online investment firm eToro to allow sponsorship payments in bitcoin.And, in August, the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) said it had completed a “successful” trial of a blockchain-based ticketing application for a match between two top Spanish clubs.PSG jersey image via Shutterstock"

The 200-Daily Moving Average (DMA) demonstrated a complete loss of bullish control the second time around when bitcoin attempted its move above $10,000 on March 12, 2018.Bitcoin’s dominance rate has also steadily increased by 0.44 percent on the week, presenting a shift away from altcoins in lieu of the expected November run-up.So it seems the bears have tightened their grip on the altcoin market possibly feeding into the new year instead of experiencing a bullish resurgence like some are expecting until they can once again break above their year-on-year targets.Disclosure: The authors hold USDT at the time of writing.Calendar image via Shutterstock; charts by Trading View"

Casey is the chairman of CoinDesk’s advisory board and a senior advisor for blockchain research at MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative.,"The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers.In February 2014, when growing interest in bitcoin spawned the first wave of “altcoins,” the tiny country of Iceland played host to a new idea for achieving mass adoption.A developer using the pseudonym Baldur Friggjar Odinsson, vowing to help his 330,000 countrymen escape six years of post-crisis capital controls, created auroracoin and promised to distribute 31.8 of them to each person on Iceland’s national registry of citizens.The idea of the “airdrop” was born.It was a success. Briefly. Then it was a flop.The initial buzz drove the price of auroracoin up more than 1000% in the first few weeks after its launch, making it briefly the third-most valuable cryptocurrency. But by mid-spring, after early recipients had quickly cashed out their winnings, the coin’s price collapsed.Halfway through 2014, it was worthless and the project abandoned. The question lingered: Was auroracoin an earnest but failed effort to provide something of lasting use to the public, or an elaborate pump and dump?Fast forward to 2018 and airdrops are all the rage. There’s even a site outlining all the offerings out there.The idea was thrust into attention by last week’s news of a $125 million distribution by wallet provider Blockchain of Stellar lumens (XLM). Predictably, that giant giveaway is stirring heated debate on whether airdrops are constructive ways to promote usage or duplicitous self-enrichment schemes.It’s a debate that hinges on the unavoidable role that community development plays in any cryptocurrency project, on who pays for that development, and on how much they stand to gain from it.Blockchain CEO Peter Smith, lauding the Stellar network for being “built for scalability” with “an active and growing ecosystem,” said the lumen airdrop would put “users first” so they can “test, try, trade, and transact with new, trusted cryptoassets in a safe and easy way.”Meanwhile, Stellar Development Foundation co-founder Jed McCaleb touted the instant network effects from expanding Stellar as a tool for communities to issue assets and design new models of value exchange. Leveraging Blockchain’s almost 30 million wallets, he said, “we will increase the network’s utility by many orders of magnitude.”Critics in the cryptocurrency community weren’t buying it. Many saw this as a scammy way for Blockchain to expand wallet usage and complained that users would have to submit to the company’s know-your-customer (KYC) procedures, creating a big, marketable data pool of personalized information for the company.Bitcoin Advisory founder Pierre Rochard was particularly brutal:I’m not going to take sides here but I think the debate could be better served by, first, viewing airdrops as a marketing expense in the service of promoting community adoption and, second, recognizing that, one way or another, adoption requires some level of marketing.A currency is nothing if it is not widely used. And that can’t be achieved unless people make some cost-incurring effort to encourage widespread usage.All currencies – even fiat currencies, I would posit – have a brand. And the success of that brand hinges on how well those with an interest in its success promote its value as a medium of exchange or store of value.For fiat currencies, governments carry out an indirect, complex marketing process by promoting the strength and effectiveness of their economies, thus encouraging both citizens and non-citizens to use their currencies to exchange and store value.We might even think of welfare distributions as airdrops with intent to promote economic activity and therefore widen currency adoption. If these policies succeed, benefits flow to the government, directly, in the form of seigniorage, and indirectly via the satisfaction that their voting constituents derive from saving and spending a widely used, and therefore valuable, currency.With cryptocurrencies, which eschew a government authority and instead defer monetary policy to open-sourced, decentralized software protocols, the promotional responsibility shifts to members of the community. But that can’t be viewed as an egalitarian process, either. It always entails vested interests and asymmetric costs and outcomes.In bitcoin, for example, early adopters knew they would benefit from enticing in second-, third- and fourth-round adopters. So they were willing to pay a price in foregone coins, freely distributing them to newcomers via “bitcoin faucets” and tens of thousands of one-off individual donations.Similarly, the development of a passionate, engaged bitcoin community – which was integral to the cryptocurrency’s success – depended on a variety of marketing exercises, all of which incurred costs in resources, effort or money. These ranged from more organic undertakings, such as the unremunerated creative work of artists who did renderings of the Bitcoin “B” logo, to the corporate-driven, such as when payment processor BitPay bought the rights to label the 2014 St. Petersburg college football playoff the St. Petersburg Bitcoin Bowl.Individual participation in all this tends to be viewed favorably. What gets up people’s noses is the presence of for-profit corporate interests, which is really why Blockchain is coming in for flak.But the truth is that vested interests exist whether it’s an individual or a company. Perhaps what matters is the size of that interest.One can imagine that if people had known the identity of pseudonymous bitcoin founder Satoshi Nakamoto, they might have looked suspiciously upon his or her large early adopter’s financial stake in the promotion of bitcoin.Consider, also, the constant refrain from crypto’s critics within the traditional economics fraternity that large-holding “whales” stand to gain from pumping bitcoin. They would view early adopter maximalists like Rochard as hypocrites. Do they have a point? Maybe.My argument, of course, is not that crypto enthusiasts shouldn’t promote the coins they own. It’s that if you level charges of a scam, it isn’t enough to just point out asymmetric payoffs, which are simply the reality of the adoption curve.Neither am I saying that we shouldn’t be wary of pump-and-dump schemes by early adopters. What I’m saying is that assessing these things requires nuance.Unfortunately, crypo utopianism tends to work against nuance. Prioritizing the dispassionate applications of mathematics and the supposedly unbiased, decentralized development of open-source protocols, many hardcore believers view all marketing and promotion with suspicion. What should drive success, they say, is not shilling and blather, but the power of the idea itself, the indisputable usefulness of the product.It’s an understandably attractive viewpoint, one conveyed in Tuur Demeester’s critique of Blockchain’s lumen airdrop.The problem with this view is that a currency is quintessentially a network product. More than anything else, its “utility” is a direct function of the size of its network. And while that network will surely fail if the product’s functionality isn’t maintained and reinforced on an ongoing basis, the critical mass that’s needed to achieve real network effects is dependent on mass communication of the idea.There’s a reason why corporate marketing budgets exist. The expense is incurred in an attempt to achieve mass, favorable awareness of a particular product or service. Those costs can be thought of in terms of the traditional advertising but also in the revenue that’s foregone in free giveaways, as in the “freemium” model with which hugely successful apps like Nintendo’s Pokémon Go get into the hands of hundreds of millions of users.I’m as wary as the next person of corporate centralization and of the danger that scams could set back the societal progress that cryptocurrencies and blockchain applications offer in fostering low-friction, peer-to-peer economic opportunity.I would simply caution against quickly jumping to condemn particular community development undertakings, including airdrops. These are not cut-and-dry issues.Skydiving image via Shutterstock"

As CoinDesk has reported, bitcoin has lost market share to tokens with greater privacy protections, such as zcash and monero. However, it “still remains the primary cryptocurrency encountered by law enforcement,” the latest update states.Notably, the report claimed that the terrorist groups have sought to raise funds using cryptocurrencies – but that to date, none of that money has been used to actually bankroll any attacks in Europe.“Yet despite the clear potential, none of the attacks carried out on European soil appear to have been funded via cryptocurrencies,” Europol noted. “The use of cryptocurrencies by terrorist groups has only involved low-level transactions – their main funding still stems from conventional banking and money remittance services.”Increasingly, Europol goes on, cryptocurrency exchanges, miners and other users face the risk of hacking attempts and even “extortion of personal data and theft.”The report also highlights the perceived risks of decentralized exchanges, which that are not controlled by a single centralized entity, saying:“Money launderers have evolved to use cryptocurrencies in their operations and are increasingly facilitated by new developments such as decentralised exchanges which allow exchanges without any Know Your Customer requirements. It is likely that high-privacy cryptocurrencies will make the current mixing services and tumblers obsolete.”The use of illicit crypto mining programs, or cryptojacking, is also listed as an emerging trend in the world of cybercrime.As reported by CoinDesk, malicious crypto-mining attacks jumped a massive 956 percent from the end of June 2017 to the same date in 2018, overtaking ransomware as the cyber-thief’s preferred tool of the trade. Even so, ransomware remains “the key threat in both law enforcement and industry reporting,” said Europol.According to the report, illicit miners hidden in website code – harnessing victims’ processor power to mine cryptos – create “additional revenue streams and therefore motivation for attackers to hack legitimate websites to exploit their visitor systems.Similarly, mining malware “can cripple a victims system by monopolising their processing power.”The report warns that the latter activity is expected to become “a regular, low-risk revenue stream for cybercriminals.”Europol image via Shutterstock"

And indeed, he barely said anything relevant to the blockchain industry.","The 42nd commander in chief has long been recognized for his rhetorical prowess, but there was little pressure on him to rouse or inspire the audience at Ripple’s event. He was sending a message on Ripple’s behalf simply by appearing on stage.Specifically, the company was saying: Ripple is the kind of company that can book Clinton to speak.While Clinton and his wife – former U.S. Senator, Secretary of State and 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton – have given talks at any number of venues over their decades of public service, the “Paid Clinton Speech” became something of a meme in 2016.During the campaign, critics on the left and right balked at the $22 million Hillary had earned giving speeches to employees of big banks and other establishment boogeymen. The content of these speeches – she refused to release transcripts – became something of a national obsession. To some, they epitomized what was perceived as overly cozy relations between DC and Wall Street.For a company like Ripple, then, there is powerful subtext in booking a Clinton to speak. To understand why, consider the ambiguity of the company’s position.Ripple is a Schrodinger’s cat.In one outcome, we open the box and a thriving fintech company emerges, one that provides a long-overdue efficiency boost to the financial services sector by introducing new, disruptive technologies: blockchain and digital assets.In the other outcome, we open the box and Ripple is just another cryptocurrency company looking for a use case: the company sells tens of millions of dollars worth of the cryptocurrency XRP every quarter through a subsidiary, but as of today, just a few firms are making commercial use of the Ripple product that leverages XRP.Meanwhile, Ripple has been taken to court by small-time investors who allege that its sales of XRP constitute an unregistered securities offering. Perhaps not coincidentally, Ripple has begun to assert that it did not create XRP – indeed, its ownership of the majority of the XRP tokens in existence is down to a “gift” from its creators.Ripple is playing a high-stakes game, in other words, and it has clearly embarked on a campaign to cultivate the right relationships, project the right image and distance itself from the wrong sorts of crypto companies.The push is evident on multiple fronts.Just a few days ago, it was reported that Ripple and others had created the Securing America’s Internet of Value Coalition (SAIV), an advocacy group that will pay its DC lobbying firm partly in XRP.Ripple’s board, meanwhile, includes a former co-president of Morgan Stanley; a former superintendent of financial services for the state of New York, who created the state’s cryptocurrency regulation; a former State Department official, who now runs a D.C.-Silicon Valley consulting firm with two former cabinet members and a former White House adviser; and an official who served in the Clinton and Obama administrations.Former Federal Reserve chair Ben Bernanke headlined last year’s Swell conference, and day one of this year’s conference included four current or former central bank officials – one of whom, Dilip Rao, is now Ripple’s head of infrastructure innovation.All of these associations with the rarified establishment of Wall Street and K Street are well and good. They reinforce what Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said onstage at Swell: for Ripple, “it wasn’t about replacing banks … there’s an opportunity to be a builder and partner with the industry.”Ripple’s choice to book Bill Clinton to speak is entirely consistent with its lobbying efforts, its taste in board members and all the other ways in which it aims to project an image of respectability.Still, the Clinton speech stands out as a particularly potent gesture.Not only does it seemingly vault Ripple into a small circle of establishment firms that book Clintons: Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank. It simultaneously distances Ripple even more emphatically from the world of fly-by-night ICOs, dark web markets, Ponzi schemes, tokens, sectarian hard forks and meat-only diets – the “crypto” scene that Ripple clearly wants nothing to do with.Part of the 2016 saga, after all, was Wikileaks, an organization that began accepting bitcoin in 2011 and has generally been popular among cryptocurrency’s more ideological devotees for its extreme anti-establishment and anti-censorship position.The site published damaging excerpts of Hillary Clinton’s speeches to banks in October 2016, just a month before the election.In this context, the symbolism of a paying for a Clinton speech is clear: this organization has nothing to do with the sorts of cypherpunks and anarchocapitalists who donate bitcoin to Wikileaks.As for the content of Clinton’s speech itself, that was unrelated to the real message.As if to drive that point home, Clinton rambled: migrant children being separated from their parents, the lapsed assault weapons ban, the positives and negatives of identity politics, the Rwandan genocide, the movie “Black Panther,” the Israel-Palestine conflict and his new novel all got as much play as blockchain technology.When Clinton did touch on the topic of the conference, it was only to say that money laundering was a risk, but that over-regulation risked stifling innovation. He also warned that toxic identity politics was a risk to blockchain somehow – as a last-minute, semi-coherent segue from the project of Hutu-Tutsi reconciliation following the horrific violence of 1994.Ten years after the financial crisis and the publication of the bitcoin white paper, much of the bitcoin-blockchain-cryptocurrency world is moving away from its anti-establishment roots.But no one is doing it with quite as much panache as Ripple.Image by David Floyd for CoinDesk"

Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Oct 24, 2018 at 10:30 UTC","The Financial Services Agency (FSA), Japan’s finance regulator, has formally approved a cryptocurrency exchange association as a self-regulatory industry body.","The FSA said in a notice on Wednesday that it has accredited the Japanese Virtual Currency Exchange Association (JVCEA) as a “certified fund settlement business association,” a status that will let the body set rules for the nation’s exchanges and take action over any violations.While the group has not announced any rules yet, a recent report from Reuters said it may require member exchanges to hold separate bank deposits and government bonds, based on a draft obtained by the news agency. The move would be aimed to ensure exchanges have sufficient funds to compensate users in the event of a hack.The association was created by 16 licensed crypto trading platforms in Japan in the wake of a $530 million hack on the Coincheck exchange early this year, and filed an application for approval with the FSA in August.Recently, the Zaif crypto exchange, one of the 16 licensed platforms, was hacked for $60 million and subsequently had to sign itself over to another firm last month because it did not have enough reserves to refund users for their losses.The association has previously made other proposals, such as imposing regular audits on crypto exchanges and limiting the amount of borrowing available to margin traders.In a separate announcement, the FSA also noted it had seen an increasing number of companies expressing interest in applying for a cryptocurrency exchange license. As such, it has updated and released the documents it requires for firms seeking to be licensed.Exchanges must now complete a 83-page Q&A form that includes details such as a platforms’ crypto reserves, offered trading pairs and their maximum leverage ratio in margin trading.Based on the FSA document, the review process will also focus on security measures taken by exchanges – for instance, whether their platform is developed in-house or whether they use third-party agencies to manage customer outreach and marketing efforts.The FSA also indicated that after reviewing written submissions it will also conduct on-site inspections at exchanges.In September, the agency said it was planning to increase staffing levels next year for its cryptocurrency exchange license scheme, stating that over 160 firms were looking to submit applications at the time.FSA image via Shutterstock"

Research. News; Learn; Research. Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Oct 23, 2018 at 21:30 UTC",A new stablecoin is launching on the Stellar blockchain that’s designed to hold its value with the Australian dollar (AUD) and is being pitched for consumer and business uses.,"Announced Tuesday at the Money 20/20 conference in Las Vegas, Novatti Group, an Australian online payments processor, will issue the Novatti AUD Utility Token beginning on November 19. The token will be backed 1-for-1 with AUD held in a trust.While traditionally, stablecoins have been a tool for cryptocurrency traders to move money quickly between exchanges, Novatti envisions its token being used for more common use cases, like remittances or purchases.Peter Cook, Novatti’s managing director,  told CoinDesk:“We think that people will use them [stablecoins] to help purchase goods from Australian enterprises. And we think that will also use them for the payment of bills or for services inside of Australia.”Novatti, a licensed payments distributor, processes payments for such clients as Vox Telecom in Europe and the South African remittance provider MoniSend. Cook said several institutions beyond Novatti’s clientele have reached out to express interest in the upcoming token because using it requires a compliant know-your-customer identity check.“We will be working with licensed money service businesses, banks and enterprises, who want access to digital assets,” Cook said, declining to name which banks at this stage. “Novatti is a publicly listed company, it’s listed on the Australian stock exchange. So that should give [users] a lot of trust.”The news comes as competition among stablecoins heats up, with several new U.S. dollar-pegged tokens launching this year, including Circle’s USD//Coin (USDC), TrustToken’s TrueUSD (TUSD), Paxos’ Paxos Standard Dollar (PAX) and the Winklevoss brothers’ Gemini Dollar (GUSD).All eyes have been on this niche for the last week, since the well-known stablecoin tether (USDT) fell below $1 and a number of exchanges quickly listed alternatives. Most recently, Coinbase said on Tuesday it will support the USDC, the exchange’s first stablecoin.Indeed, Lisa Nestor, director of partnerships at the Stellar Development Foundation, told CoinDesk that Stellar already supports at least 10 stablecoins, including USD Anchor, created by startup Stronghold with help from IBM.Requests continue to pour in for Stellar to support new fiat-pegged options (known in the Stellar community as anchors), she said.“There are network effects here,” Nestor said. “It took us almost a year to get our first two currency anchors on the network. But then each time we add another one, it makes it easier to add one more.”But the motivation to create these assets is also shifting, she said. “I think there was tension in the crypto marketplace, and that drove many of the earlier stablecoins. But we also see continued adoption and growth in the payments space.”Despite the recent fluctuations in prices (besides tether breaking the buck, other stablecoins have surged above $1 in the last week), some believe stablecoins can offer faster and less expensive ways to send remittances.“For example in Venezuela, even sending money through the banks gets exchanged at a horrible rate,” Venezuelan-born stablecoin advocate León Markovitz told CoinDesk. However, Markovitz quickly added that crypto startups can’t “fix a country’s economy on their own.”Novatti’s token will be the first AUD-pegged crypto asset on Stellar, but not the first on the market. In September, the Australian exchange Bit Trade announced it was working with the employment platform Emparta to launch a stablecoin in 2019 so employers can pay Emparta users with cryptocurrency.Australian currency image via Shutterstock"

“Bitcoin is the world's first globally accessible public money. Is it 
perfect?","Oct 11, 2018 at 19:40 UTC","Advocacy versus skepticism. “Dr. Doom” versus “Captain Coin.” Whatever you want to call it, two divergent viewpoints on the topic of cryptocurrency collided before a group of U.S senators on Thursday.","Economist Nouriel Roubini – famous for predicting the 2008 financial crisis testified about the blockchain and crypto ecosystems before the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs alongside Coin Center director of Research Peter Van Valkenburgh.And as his written testimony indicated, Roubini took a harsh stance against the technology and its proponents in front of the lawmakers.“Crypto is the mother and father of all scams … [and] blockchain is the most overhyped technology ever and is no better than a glorified database,” Roubini said in his opening statement.Van Valkenburgh took a somewhat more nuanced approach, telling the committee that while blockchain and cryptocurrencies are not perfect or even fully complete at present, they are a significant step in improving the financial situation for many.He cited the story of Roya Mahboob, who was unable to pay her employees as many did not have bank accounts. Instead, she paid using bitcoin.In his statement, Van Valkenburgh said:“Bitcoin is the world’s first globally accessible public money. Is it perfect? No. Neither was email when it was invented in 1972. Bitcoin’s not the best money on every margin. It’s not yet accepted everywhere. It’s not used often to quote prices and it’s not a stable store of value.”“But it is working, and the fact that it works without intermediaries is amazing,” he added.The eight senators (out of a possible 25 on the committee) who asked questions at the hearing split their time relatively evenly between concerns about criminal activity, market activities and use cases.However, unlike some of the previous hearings on the industry, Thursday’s hearing was entirely educational on the lawmakers’ part. No actions regarding the cryptocurrency space were proposed or called for during the proceedings.As such, much of the focus during the session remained on what issues blockchain might pose and what problems the technology might help solve. It was here that the two witnesses diverged sharply.Corporations and banks will likely not use decentralized ledgers unless they can maintain full control, Roubini asserted.On the other hand, “roughly half of all Americans, 143 million people, had their Social Security numbers stolen because of a breach at Equifax,” Van Valkenburgh noted during a list of potential disruptions caused by centralized institutions which maintain poor security practices.In response to another question by Senator Doug Jones, Roubini stated that criminals are using cryptocurrencies in a number of activities, including tax evasion, claiming that the anonymity granted to users allows them to hide from legal authorities.“I would be interested in knowing how you can use something that isn’t money to evade taxes … It’s not anonymous at all … several law enforcement officials and investigators who enjoy doing blockchain investigations because you can track [activities],” Van Valkenburgh retorted.What the ideals behind blockchain ultimately come down to, Van Valkenburgh said during his testimony, is the fact that many private corporations currently act as single points of failure in banking, communications and other services, and though these corporations may be important to society, “no critical infrastructure should be wholly dependent on one or two.”He concluded:“[Blockchain] is not yet ready to answer all of these problems but it is our best hope, and as with the Internet in the 90s, we need light-touch pro-innovation policy to ensure that these innovations flourish in America for the benefit and security of all Americans.”The differences between the two attendees were further put on display by way of comments published after the appearance before the U.S. senators.Following the event, Van Valkenburgh said in a statement that he appreciated “the opportunity to present the committee with real-world examples of the value public blockchain networks can bring to society, and to respond to some of the criticisms that have been leveled against them for years.”In contrast, Roubini took aim at the many social media critics who responded disdainfully to his remarks as the hearing went on.Roubini tweeted:“Crypto twitter is a cesspool of bots, trolls, shills, scammers, crypto zealots and lunatics. Barking dogs that attack me after losing 90 [percent] in last year. None read my paper & none have any substantial critique. This motley crew is a bunch of pathetic lunatics & HODLing losers”Nouriel Roubini image via U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs"

wallet balances (left vertical axis), purple denote bitcoin price (right).","Oct 31, 2018 at 20:30 UTC","In what’s become a rarity over the past month, the price of the tether (USDT) stablecoin temporarily regained parity with the U.S. dollar Wednesday.","The token traded in the $1.00-$1.01 range for the better part of an hour, according to CoinMarketCap. At the time of writing, it is trading around $0.987.The exchange rate has been steadily climbing towards its $1.00 target since the stablecoin – by far the most popular among a slew of rivals – dramatically lost parity with the dollar in mid-October, falling as low as $0.85 on the Kraken exchange, one of relatively few where traders can sell USDT directly for dollars.The exact reasons for the recovery are not clear, but the total supply of tethers in circulation has fallen rapidly in recent weeks. (Tether also briefly hit $1.01 on Monday.)Since Oct. 14 Bitfinex – an exchange that shares common ownership and management with Tether Ltd., the company behind USDT – has sent 930 million USDT to a wallet controlled by Tether Ltd. known as the “treasury.” These tokens are considered to have been removed from circulation, and though many of them still exist, Tether destroyed 500 million USDT last week.As a result, the market capitalization of tether has fallen to under $1.8 billion, from its peak last month of $2.8 billion.Writing to CoinDesk last week, Bitfinex’s director of communications, Kasper Rasmussen, said that Tether is not scaling back its supply intentionally, adding that the destruction of tether tokens “does not have anything to do with defending dollar parity.”In an email to CoinDesk Wednesday, he declined to comment on “secondary market price fluctuations of Tether.” He added, “Bitfinex and Tether issue and redeem at 1 USD and that’s all I can say.”As the second-most traded cryptocurrency by volume, according to CoinMarketCap, tether holds a key place in the crypto ecosystem. Traders have used it as a way to speed up withdrawals and deposits to exchanges, which are often slow when using fiat currency, as well as a way to insulate themselves from price volatility.Notably, USDT tokens have been flowing consistently into a wallet controlled by Bitfinex, suggesting that the exchange is doing a lot of “redemption.” The term, as used in the Tether white paper, refers to holders’ ability to exchange USDT directly for U.S. dollars through Tether Ltd., a service many people say is not in practice available.As the chart below shows, Bitfinex’s USDT balance rose from close to zero to slightly more than 100 million from Oct. 25 to Oct. 30, the day the exchange sent almost its entire wallet balance to the Tether treasury in a single transaction. Since then, the balance has begun to climb again, hitting 39 million in just over 24 hours.Following another 50 million transfer out of the wallet after this chart was prepared, the balance has fallen to 155,000 USDT.Source: Next Wave Strat; yellow lines denote USDT wallet balances (left vertical axis), purple denote bitcoin price (right) The USDT balances of other exchanges, meanwhile, have been declining.Binance, currently the largest holder of USDT tokens after the Tether treasury, has seen its “hot wallet” balance fall from above 100 million on Oct. 23 to 38 million at the time of writing:The large jump in the Binance hot wallet’s balance on Oct. 23 represents a transfer from the exchange’s “cold wallet,” which currently holds around 594 million USDT:Bittrex, which offers a USDT-USD trading pair that allows tether holders to trade directly for dollars, has seen a steady decline in its USDT balance over the past 10 days, from 134 million USDT on Oct. 19 to 115 million at the time of writing:Finally, Kraken, which also offers a USDT-USD trading pair and saw a notable inflow of tethers during the period when the stablecoin diverged from the dollar most drastically, has seen its USDT balance fall from nearly 55 million just three days ago, on Oct. 28, to just over 27 million.While the exact trajectory of USDT tokens is not always obvious, it is clear that large numbers of tethers are flowing out of several exchanges, that large numbers are flowing into Bitfinex, and that Bitfinex is then sending them on to the Tether treasury.In some cases, however, it appears that exchanges are sending USDT directly to Bitfinex. For example, a wallet believed to belong to Kraken sent 8 million USDT to Bitfinex on Tuesday.The wallet address is not identified on Tether’s Rich List, but it did recently receive a 2 million USDT transaction from a known Kraken address. Kraken did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Regarding the charts cited above, Bitfinex’s Rasmussen said that they “display data from the previous 10 days only. I’m not sure anything can be extrapolated from that.”Clothespins image via Shutterstock"

Currently, in order to make transactions, hardware wallet users must generally access their digital assets using a desktop client connected over USB.“While cold wallets are the best option for maintaining private keys, they still have a low adoption rate. But we want to bring that hardware security to hot wallet users and ultimately change their perception about what’s most secure in the crypto world, but at the same time allowing them to manage their assets with liquidity,” he said.For instance, He added, with the new imToken solution, Ledger and Coolwallet users could still maintain their private keys offline, but still directly initiate bitcoin, ethereum and EOS transactions for trading or participation in decentralized applications supported inside the mobile app.However, the CEO said that compatibility between the wallets is achieved via Bluetooth. The integrations with CoolBitX’s Coolwallet S and Ledger’s Blue – both Bluetooth-enabled devices – are expected to formally go live by December this year, and in Q1 2019, respectively.While that means the solution will not support Ledger’s USB-only devices, like the Nano wallet, it would be able to integrate with future products if they add Bluetooth connectivity.The news follows a recent report that Ledger is expanding to Asian markets with the appointment of capital market veteran Benjamin Soong. The company said 30 percent of its device sales now come from Asian markets.When asked about the pending integration, Ledger told CoinDesk: “Ledger supports this move like any integration done using our platform. We’re an open platform and we’ll publish anything that follows our app integration guidelines.”ImToken, founded in 2016, has grown into one of the largest ethereum wallet services with around 7 million users – 75 percent of whom come from its home market, China. The startup claims it currently handles about 10 percent of all daily ethereum transactions.In June, imToken raised $10 million in a Series A funding round fully backed by investment firm IDG Capital.Also announced today, Beijing-based wallet hardware maker imKey – in which imToken’s venture arm has a stake – is to roll out a new hardware wallet called imKey, with pre-orders to start by the end of this year.Update (Nov. 5, 2018, 08:00 UTC): Added comment from LedgerWallet image via Shutterstock"

A little more than two years ago, a protocol improving two of blockchain’s biggest problems, privacy and scalability, aptly titled “MimbleWimble,” was released by a cryptographer going by the pseudonym.Even ever-fickle active bitcoin developers agreed it was a good proposal, one that would go on to spark a flurry of innovation and activity. Blockchain projects Grin and Beam are now putting its ambitious mathematical ideas to the test, hoping to finish a working blockchain that puts its ideas into practice for the first time soon.This new paper, called “Fragmented Transaction Protocol,” promises a second privacy boost, aiming to “obfuscate transaction amounts until the moment the coin is spent.” As such, the community is quietly hoping the author is the same person about to inspire developers once again, this time with a focus on privacy.So far, there’s some evidence in favor. For one, the new Voldemort did everything the old Voldemort did: Just a couple hours ago, they released the paper and called the “bitcoin-wizards” chat channel on IRC. It was originally released as an “onion” address, preserving the anonymity of the author.But these might just be superficial similarities.Mathematician and developer Andrew Poelstra, who was the first to go public with a positive assessment of MimbleWimble, voiced doubts about whether this new paper is by the same author. In fact, his first reaction is that it’s not a very good proposal as it “breaks” some of the privacy aspects of MimbleWimble.As such, he thinks it probably is not by the pseudonymous cryptographer who wrote MimbleWimble.“This has a very different writing style from the original Tom Jedusor paper, and has very broken incentives obviated by [confidential transactions] (CT). It would have much worse privacy than CT even if it did work,” he said, responding to the released of the paper in the chat channel.If Poelstra’s initial reaction is correct, the new Voldemort is may be just be another developer who wanted to draw more attention to his proposal. For now, however, the true identity of the paper author (as well as its potential impact) remains to be seen.Harry Potter image via Shutterstock"

And OKCoin USA will participate in rolling out a regulated stablecoin.”That said, the authors of the CN Finance article also pointed out there’s still a long way to go before stablecoins can make a real impact on worldwide economies.“If stablecoins can scale eventually, the role of central banks could be in a dilemma. Fiat currencies issued by central banks will become collateral to back stablecoins, but will not end up in the market circulation. That will limit the role of central banks in payment settlements and monetary policies,” the authors say.They conclude:“The evolution of this monetary system will likely be eventually achieved by a central bank-issued fiat digital currency.”Chinese yuan image via Shutterstock"

Today, it is facing questions about its survival.","On Saturday, according to a post by the Crowd Machine team, a hacker compromised the company’s cryptocurrency wallet and stole a large number of the application’s native Crowd Machine Compute Tokens (CMCT). Digging further, according to Etherscan, the thief appears to have made off with over 1 billion CMCT, most of which were then transferred to exchanges.The price of the tokens fell steeply following the incident, dropping by 87 percent on Saturday to a low of around $0.0019, according to CoinMarketCap data.“We are working to resolve this issue as fast as we can,” the Crowd Machine team wrote Sunday, adding:“Because this matter is currently under criminal investigation, we are unable to make any further comments at this time.”Admins posted a similar message to the project’s Telegram channel.Crowd Machine attracted attention after two developers from Blockstream, one of the most prominent cryptocurrency startups, left to join the project in February this year.One of those, Ben Gorlick, became CTO, though according to his LinkedIn page he left Crowd Machine in May. The second, Johnny Dilley became chief of system architecture for the new company, although now his LinkedIn page does not list Crowd Machine and the company’s site does not include him as a team member.Saeed Al Darmaki, a former advisor to the project who quit this month because – he alleged – Crowd Machine did not pay him the token compensation he was promised, told CoinDesk that “poor management” by CEO Craig Sproule had prompted employees to leave. He declined to identify the employees to whom he was referring.Crowd Machine’s goal is to build a globally distributed cloud, a sort of Amazon Web Services that would not be subject to the control of a single company or suffer from a single point of failure. According to the company’s website, this “Crowd Computer” is scheduled to be released in the fourth quarter.Crowd Machine conducted a pre-sale of CMCT tokens in April, but has not continued with its planned series of 390 daily public sales.Few details have been provided about the situation. And in the absence of further updates, speculation has swirled, including unsubstantiated allegations that the thefts were an inside job.The stolen coins have been dumped onto two exchanges so far: Idex and Bittrex.On Saturday, Idex announced on Twitter that it was de-listing CMCT following reports of “suspicious activity.” At the time of writing, Bittrex had also suspended CMCT trading.Sproule told CoinDesk in an email on Tuesday that the team had requested these trading freezes (Idex previously said they’d been in contact with Crowd Machine).Sproule added that a law enforcement investigation was underway and an “arrest has been made.” Though he did not say who had been arrested and declined to specify what law enforcement agencies were involved in the investigation, saying the agencies in question had asked him not to reveal their identity.As some pointed out on Crowd Machine’s Telegram, Bittrex requires users to upload identification, which may have allowed the authorities to make an arrest so quickly.In an update on Medium, Sproule recommended that no one trade the tokens until the authorities had finished their investigation, though he wrote that “purchases of stolen tokens by those not involved with the theft will be honored.”Speaking to CoinDesk, he offered reassurance to the community:“Assets are currently being recovered.”Hacker image via Shutterstock"

Research. News; Learn; Research. Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Oct 16, 2018 at 12:59 UTC","If 2017 was a year when fundraising for decentralized protocols dominated headlines, 2018’s emerging narrative is about empowering investors.","From fits and starts on ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake to Tezos’ launch, governance has been one of the persistent conversations in crypto this year. But for all the promise, one long awaited approach to blockchain governance, Decred’s Politeia software, went live today at 1300 UTC.As CoinDesk previously reported, Politeia builds on Decred’s existing approach of combining proof-0f-work and proof-of-stake consensus by attempting to turn over all governance decisions to those actively participating in the operation of its protocol at the time of any given decision.Those who own Decred tokens (DCR) currently stake the coins in exchange for a chance to be chosen to verify blocks. (If they get chosen and do so, they get a payment from that block’s token emission.) Once Politeia goes live, though, people waiting for their turn at block verification will also be able to vote on Politeia proposals (though there’s no payment for that).In a blog post shared with CoinDesk, Decred Project Lead Jake Yocom-Piatt confirmed the imminent launch, but he did so with a note of caution, writing:“It is important to understand that Politeia is a very powerful tool: it can enable all manner of positive developments for Decred, but if used unwisely, it can lead to a wide variety of problems.”In short, Politeia gives holders of the cryptocurrency a way to exercise control over every aspect of the project, meaning it puts the Decred treasury in their hands. That treasury currently holds DCR 570,000, valued at roughly $21 million.The treasury is funded by a portion of new coins emitted with each block, so it’s constantly growing.As Decred users start making proposals for expenditures and the community begins voting them through, Yocom-Piatt is going to initially maintain a veto power over expenditures. He’s told the community that he intends only to use these powers if a specific proposal puts the project itself or the legal entity that manages it into jeopardy.His veto power will sunset in six to 12 months when control of the funds moves from Decred Holdings Group LLC, an organization he manages, to a smart contract.“Once the smart contract replaces the corporate entity as the holder of the Treasury funds, there is no longer a legal entity to target with sanctions or other penalties that could result from certain stakeholder-backed actions,” he told CoinDesk.But Politeia is not limited to financial decisions.It also opens up decision-making around how the organization that supports Decred works, how its staff is managed and even the fundamental consensus model that Decred uses. For example, Yocom-Piatt will also announce plans to put forward a non-treasury proposal to the community.Specifically, he intends to propose defining how potential contractors will be vetted before they can start doing work. The process is meant to insure new contractors can work well with existing ones.At the same time, he notes that it is important that Decred never becomes a way for the protocol’s whole community to micromanage its individual contributors, lest “we run the risk of turning staffing into a stakeholder popularity contest and driving voter apathy,” Yocom-Piatt writes.Beyond that, though, the fact that a proposal is forthcoming on the process for vetting contractors illustrates a larger point.As Yocom-Piatt put it to CoinDesk:“Literally everything is on the table with Decred.”Elsewhere in the announcement, the project sought to label the release as the start of a new era in the life of the young technology.Yocom-Piatt compares Politeia to a hybrid of corporate governance and nation-state governance, but he exhorts his readers to avoid the pitfalls of either.“Making good decisions requires a combination of understanding, intuition and long-term planning, and I hope to see stakeholders make decisions on this basis going forward. Bad decisions are often driven by ignorance, greed and short-term thinking, which we need to make an effort to avoid,” he writes.Collective decision-making is always difficult, and Yocom-Piatt’s post delves into potential dangers, such as conflicts of interest, making permanent commitments to spend money that outlive their usefulness and even the temptation to turn authority over to elected officials.Yocom-Piatt urges the community to keep the structure flat, roles loosely defined but expenditures tightly defined against milestones. As such, Decred’s boosters, like Placeholder’s Chris Burniske, look forward to a day when Politeia will be able to govern projects outside of the blockchain as well.Others in the space are more cynical about the evolution blockchain governance so far. The creator of smart contracts, Nick Szabo, wrote in a famous tweet:
Decred seems to be aiming for the last option, but its founder seems realistic that either of the former always loom as possibilities.With this deployment, Yocom-Piatt predicts:“We can expand the scope of our work and engage more meaningfully with our users. There will surely be surprises along the way, so expect the unexpected and stay vigilant.”Parthenon photo via Pixabay/Nonbirinonko (Creative Commons)"

The bills tackle a range of issues around the blockchain space, including development, miners and cryptocurrency-related taxes.The bills are aimed at providing support for the nascent industry, a press release said.In a statement, Emmer said that “the United States should prioritize accelerating the development of blockchain technology and create an environment that enables the American private sector to lead on innovation and further growth.”He added:“Legislators should be embracing emerging technologies and providing a clear regulatory system that allows them to flourish in the [U.S.].”The bills specifically will touch on the regulatory approach to the space, essentially providing developers and users some leeway in building, mining or transacting with cryptocurrencies.The first bill “expresses support for the industry and its development” within the U.S. by advocating for “a light touch, consistent and simple legal environment.”The second bill would ensure cryptocurrency miners do not need to register as money transmitters, as they “never take control of consumer funds.”This legislation would also include multisignature wallet providers.The final bill would create a “safe harbor” for taxpayers who have any cryptocurrencies resulting from a network hard fork. The bill would prevent the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) from levying any fines against taxpayers who try to report gains from these tokens, at least until the IRS provides clear guidance on how taxpayers can report such gains.Emmer’s new bills come the same day he and fellow Representative Bill Foster were named co-chairs of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus, a group of lawmakers focused on spurring blockchain technology development through legislation in the U.S. government’s lower house.“I am proud to join my colleagues to lead Congress so that policymakers and industry can work together to realize this promise and unleash its economic potential in the United States and around the world,” Foster said in a statement.Tom Emmer image via Al Mueller / Shutterstock"

Bitwala raised €4 million in new funding last month to support its efforts.Thus far, according to the company, 35,000 users have pre-registered for the upcoming service.Speaking to CoinDesk, Kessler stressed that “we are a blockchain banking service” and not a bank. That said, Bitwala hopes to get there one day, and is planning to seek a German banking license of its own next year.Bitwala’s partner has some notable backers, including Spain-based BBVA and card provider Visa. SolarisBank closed a €56.6 million Series B funding round earlier this year, according to TechCrunch, having been founded in 2016.Kessler explained two aspects of solarisBank drew Bitwala to it: the “fantastic technical platform that allows” any company the ability to easily “go in and plug your use cases” into the solarisBank API, and the regulatory access vis-a-vis its banking license.Indeed, solarisBank positioned itself as a possible partner for the crypto-industry through its Blockchain Factory effort.And the solarisBank partnership helps Bitwala avoid some of the regulatory pitfalls it’s encountered in the past. In January, Bitwala was one of several cryptocurrency companies affected when Visa Europe closed the account of its debit card issuer.“We are very proud to partner with solarisBank as we launch our new product.

But it wasn’t a huge leap for Israel-specific ICOs, with One Alpha finding that firms in the country raised $586 million in total during 2017 between less than 20 token sales.Yaniv Feldman, CEO of One Alpha, told CoinDesk, said the figures speak to the strength of the blockchain ecosystem in Israel more broadly.“Israelis are less than 0.1 percent of global population while making 3 to 5 percent of global ICO fundraising amount is definitely something that shows that Israel is one of the most important in terms of blockchain innovation,” he said.As previously reported, 2018 saw Israeli regulators clarifying their positions on matters related to cryptocurrency in blockchain. For example, back in March, the Israel Securities Authority recommended regulations that sought to differentiate so-called utility tokens from crypto-assets that are considered securities, a move that came several months after officials released a draft plan for the taxation of ICOs in January.Looking to the future, Feldman remarked that Israel isn’t interested in being overly crypto-friendly, compared to jurisdictions like Malta or Gibraltar.

He added that the company is “committed to getting it done,” which will “certainly be in 2019.”The company announced its plan to enter the Japanese market in 2016, and appointed former Morgan Stanley Japan staffer Nao Kitazawa to head its local office in June.As CoinDesk reported last month, Lempres has moved on from his previous role as the chief legal officer for the exchange, and now works on government affairs.He said that security is currently the top concern at the FSA, which regulates Japan’s financial markets, following two major crypto exchange hacks in the nation this year: Coincheck in January and Zaif in September.The FSA has not yet issued any crypto exchange licenses so far this year, despite having reviewed 16 applications. Meanwhile, more than 160 firms including public companies are planning to apply for exchange licenses, as CoinDesk has reported.Still, Lempres claimed that the watchdog’s toughened stance would actually work in Coinbase’s favor, since the exchange stores 99 percent of its funds offline in cold wallets that are not connected to the internet, making a significant cyber-attack far less likely.“The Japanese government is more focused on security,” he was quoted as saying, adding: “That is good for us.”The main issue now, he added, is whether Coinbase will be required by the FSA to duplicate its U.S. system inside Japan. That approach would help the FSA monitor transactions, but could raise the possibility of a hack, Lempres warned.“We have everything built to protect our storage… in the U.S. … It would be hard for us to duplicate what we do in the U.S. today in Japan and other countries,” he said.Traffic signal image via Shutterstock"

Research. News; Learn; Research. Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Oct 17, 2018 at 07:59 UTC",A highly anticipated technology designed to make blockchain privacy features more scalable will be tested in the wild soon.,"Named “bulletproofs,” the tech, which was invented by cryptographers Benedict Bunz and Jonathan Bootle, promises to dramatically decrease the weight of confidential transactions, and on Thursday, Oct. 18, privacy-oriented cryptocurrency monero will put that to the test.The first major cryptocurrency to deploy the technology, monero has been focused on how to implement bulletproofs for the past year – in an effort to cut the size of its confidential transactions by at least 80 percent.As well as dealing with the scaling setbacks inherent to most blockchains, monero comes with additional privacy layers, which are heavy to compute and unruly to store. The scalability of confidential transactions have been a significant hurdle for the $1 billion blockchain, with users long suffering high transaction fees as well as an ever-increasing cost of storage for running a full node.Speaking to this, pseudonymous monero cryptographer Sarang Noether, who assisted with the bulletproof integration, told CoinDesk:“Blockchain bloat was definitely an issue for monero.”Bulletproofs will replace the current zero-knowledge range proofs that its confidential transactions rely on.As such, the cryptocurrency will activate the technology during its next system-wide upgrade, or hard fork. A kind of upgrade that requires all nodes to adopt a new software, hard forks are sometimes colored as a risky process, however, this upgrade is part of monero’s bi-annual cycle to introduce new features.“We’re excited about it,” Sarang continued. “Part of the reason we do the upgrades is so we can be safely on the cutting edge, and I think this is a really, really good move forward.”It’s worth noting that bulletproofs don’t actually contribute to privacy itself. Rather, they simply ensure that the information stored within a confidential transaction doesn’t contain any false information.“They’re not about anonymity; they are about assuring that the other stuff we do for anonymity works correctly,” Sarang told CoinDesk.Monero relies on three different mechanisms in combination with each other –stealth addresses, ring signatures and ring confidential transactions – in order to achieve anonymity. Bulletproofs target the latter, ring confidential transactions, or RingCT, which is how monero obscures the quantities that are being sent in a transaction.Because RingCT’s use ring signatures, a cryptographic operation that obscures data by mixing it up with different outputs, monero needs a way to ensure that transactions balance correctly – that is, to make it impossible for money to be printed in the process.Up until now, monero has relied a kind of zero-knowledge range proofs to fulfill this task, named a bitwise Borromean range proof.Trouble is, these range proofs are “a very slow and large operation,” Sarang said, to the point that “the vast bulk of our transactions, size wise, on the blockchain are these existing range proofs.”Instead, bulletproofs work by aggregating information into new data structures that scale logarithmically, rather than linearly – meaning that the scaling gets even more notable for large transactions that contain multiple outputs.Speaking to this, Sarang said:“It does the same thing, this nice, black box, zero-knowledge proof idea, but is much, much, much smaller and much, much, much faster to do.”Thursday’s upgrade will be introducing other changes to monero’s codebase as well.Targeting the ring signatures that monero relies on to conceal sender identities, the upgrade will increase the mandatory ring size, which is heralded as a way to increase monero’s anonymity set and make it less vulnerable to linking attacks.The upgrade also implements a second tweak to monero’s mining algorithm – intended to dissuade the emergence of ASICs, a highly optimized mining hardware, from being used on the network. As detailed by CoinDesk, this is following an upgrade in March that disabled a line of ASIC hardware that had been developed for the cryptocurrency – a move that has since become regarded as the genesis of crypto’s “war on miners.”Still, of all the upgrades, bulletproofs has been the most hotly anticipated, in part due to the simplicity of adding the tech to monero’s overarching privacy system.“It’s not often you can basically take a cryptographic instruction, yank it out and put a new one in, but this was one case where we could do that,” Sarang told CoinDesk.With the focus on bulletproofs then, the code also tweaks monero’s underlying fee structure so that it “more accurately reflects the fact that bulletproofs scales so well,” Sarang continued.As mentioned, the upgrade will begin on October 18 but will happen in two parts. On the 18th, bulletproofs will be enabled on monero, and by Friday, the tech will be made compulsory. Users who update their software shouldn’t notice this at all, Sarang said.Going forward, monero researchers, are looking for more experimental ways to scale monero – which might one day include moving away from ring signatures altogether.Alongside another cryptographer named “Surae Noether,” Sarang works under the Monero Research Lab, a section of monero development dedicated to analyzing academic innovations in cryptography and deciding whether they can be applied to monero.“We’re taking all this new stuff and saying what if anything can be feasible in the future for our community,” Sarang said, adding:“We’re always looking at new ways to move away from ring signatures in order to get better anonymity sets, or at the very least ring signatures that scale better.”And on top of that, Sarang said, cross chain atomic swaps, payment channels and networks, as well as “fundamentals like refund transactions” are being examined as part of the lab’s work.Still, the developer was quick to draw attention to what he calls the “mitigation horizon” – of the difficulty of implementing cutting-edge ideas that could have effects on the cryptocurrency’s community, assets and other features.“You have the new technology that you’re interested in investigating, but what happens at that transition point where you have to bring everyone over with you?” Sarang asked.According to the developer, bulletproofs was unique in this capacity.He told CoinDesk, “Bulletproofs was this cool example of something that was a nice self-contained entity that we were able to deploy in a way that is working great.”Bulletproof glass image via Shutterstock"

While the program continues to grow, we will increasingly continue to involve more community members in the decision making process.”In a statement, Status COO Nabil Naghdy told CoinDesk that the company is “proud that the Ethereum Foundation has chosen to co-fund this research initiative, enabling us to align our values and vision to the benefit [of] all participants in the ecosystem.”“The grant brings us closer to other client teams and ensures collaboration with brilliant minds working on similar problems. The challenges facing Ethereum are not project or team specific, they face us all,” he said.Ethereum image via Shutterstock"

This enables the platform to be “deployed inside corporate data centres, while retaining the ability to communicate securely with other nodes anywhere else in the world,” according to a press release.Katerina Koutoulaki, associate director at R3, told CoinDesk by email:“Currently, two banks involved in the project are members of R3. They share our goal of moving blockchain applications into commercial deployment and changing business from within and we are pleased to be working with them on this project”The project also utilizes the Sia blockchain node infrastructure. The hope is to “create bilateral channels through which each counterparty can exchange information whilst maintaining confidentiality and privacy so that only those with a need to see the data can access it,” according to the release.ABI Lab was set up to investigate whether blockchain can provide data transparency and visibility, faster transactions and the “ability to perform checks and exchanges directly within the application.”The group is now preparing for the next phase of the project in which the banks will utilize the blockchain application for everyday transactions.Intesa Sanpaolo bank pavilion image via Shutterstock"

The increased throughput will ensure our platform is able to meet any level of demand. Our matching engine was already powerful enough to stay online through the massive rally last winter and this move will ensure trading on our platform remains stable no matter what.”This speed boost will, in turn, help Bitstamp develop an institutional trading service, Osojnik went on, allowing the exchange “to add additional order types and trading pairs without a drop in performance and as well as provide a new direct API endpoint.”The new matching engine will be implemented in a few phases, with the first changes taking place in the first quarter of next year and completion expected by the end of June, Bitstamp said.For Bitstamp, which was one of the first crypto exchanges to acquire a payment institution license in the EU back in 2016, the new trading system will be another step to establish itself as a bridge between crypto and traditional finance,CEO Nejc Kodrič said in a press release.“Our matching engine will be on par with traditional exchanges in both speed and throughput,” Kodrič said. “We chose Cinnober because of their proven track-record in worldwide financial marketplaces.”Founded in 1998, Stockholm-based Cinnober is known for powering traditional exchanges with its software, among them the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX), Brazil’s B3, Dubai Gold & Commodities Exchange (DGCX), Japan Exchange Group (JPX), the London Metal Exchange (LME), the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE), and others.Peter Lenardos, CEO of the Cinnober Group, said his company’s new system will help Bitstamp provide stable service to its users. “By upgrading their trading technology to further improve performance and stability as interest from investors and regulators grow, they demonstrate their firm commitment to providing a safe and reliable marketplace,” he said in the press release.Bitstamp was founded in 2011 and now has branches in London, Luxembourg, Slovenia and the U.S. As CoinDesk reported in October, a majority ownership stake in Bitstamp has just been bought by NXMH, an investment firm owned by South Korean conglomerate NXC and based in Belgium.Nejc Kodric image via Bitcoin.com"

Grouped together, there are currently 622 crypto funds across all categories, 303 of those being crypto hedge funds, which represent assets of less than $4 billion, according to the research.The research also looks at the geography of new crypto hedge fund launches, saying around a half are based in the U.S. However, multiple launches have been seen in Australia, China, Malta, Switzerland, The Netherlands and the U.K. this year.Gnaizda concluded:“While we don’t believe the rate of new launches is sustainable longer-term, there are currently few signs of a significant slowdown.”Coins image via Shutterstock"

It was in this spirit that Coinbase started its open source fund, a token of gratitude for this type of community-oriented work.”Coinbase now utilizes the tool to coordinate security scans across all its deployed services.“It helps us enforce security policies for each change made to a codebase and ensures there is a quick feedback loop with the developer about potential vulnerabilities,” Borrey wrote.Keys image via Shutterstock"

of low-value payments in the cryptocurrency, reserving the ...","Oct 12, 2018 at 16:00 UTC",Microsoft is moving to turn blockchain-based decentralized identity from a lofty aspiration into a business line.,"In a white paper posted this week, the software giant says it intends to develop two products designed to give consumers greater control of their personal data – long the Holy Grail of many technologists in the blockchain space and adjacent industries.One such product is an encrypted personal data store, or “identity hub,” which is a combination of user’s personal devices and cloud storage that Microsoft would offer through Azure, its cloud computing service.Although few details are provided, the general idea is that consumers could store identity information in this hub and their permission would be required for third parties to access it. This stands in contrast to the status quo, where data is held at countless third parties and regularly obtained without the user’s knowledge, much less consent.The other product Microsoft says it will build is a “wallet-like app” that people could use, among other purposes, to manage these permissions to their data, including the ability to revoke them when desired.Notably – and here’s where blockchain comes in – both of these products would build upon the foundation of decentralized identifiers (DIDs), a specification developed under the auspices of the World Wide Web Foundation (W3C).Seen by many in the ID community as a breakthrough, DIDs do not require a central authority because they are registered, or “anchored,” on a distributed ledger or another decentralized system. This means that unlike traditional identifiers (think of a phone number or a Twitter handle), a DID is always under the user’s control, much in the way a crypto user has domain over her money.Further, the paper reveals that Microsoft is developing an open-source implementation of DIDs that would work as a second layer on top of multiple blockchains. Somewhat like bitcoin’s Lightning Network is meant to allow a high volume of low-value payments in the cryptocurrency, reserving the blockchain for final settlement, the layer two for identity is being “designed for world-scale use,” the paper says.The goal of that project (which Microsoft is referring to internally as “side trees”) is to “establish a unified, interoperable ecosystem that developers and businesses can rely on to build a new wave of products, applications, and services,” according to the paper.While Microsoft did not give a timetable for any of these projects, taken together, these moves suggest that the company is stepping up its investment in “self-owned identity,” beyond its previously reported participation in the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF) as a founding member.“Every person has a right to an identity that they own and control,” the paper declares, adding:“We aspire to make DIDs a first-class citizen of the Microsoft identity stack.”Stepping back, as a decades-old, multinational corporation, Microsoft might seem to some an unlikely champion for this decentralist vision.Yet while the majority of the components of the new system Microsoft is building would operate off-chain, the advent of blockchains has clearly fired imaginations, at the Redmond, Washington-based company and elsewhere in the ID community.“If you start with the premise of what blockchain can do for identity, it opens up the aperture to think about how you can have a consumer- or constituent-owned ID that then you can do different things with,” Yorke Rhodes, a program manager on Microsoft’s blockchain engineering team, told CoinDesk in a podcast interview last month.Microsoft joined the DIF because the company wants to make sure that the systems being built today don’t end up becoming “new islands like the social media islands of today, where you can’t connect an identity from LinkedIn to Twitter, to Facebook, to WeChat, to Weibo,” Rhodes said.Instead, in an ideal system, “if I create my identity in a Microsoft system, if somebody comes along with MetaMask or uPort or any other wallet, they should actually be able to understand what that identity is,” Rhodes said, referring to two ethereum-based apps by way of example.Rhodes also said that in the next few months Microsoft would expand the range of identity types that Active Directory, its enterprise ID system, can recognize to include blockchain-based decentralized identities. This would allow a company to quickly onboard a new hire, recognize a decentralized ID that she controls, and associate it with her new corporate employee ID.“That is, in my perspective, one of the levers that will actually help drive toward consumer-owned identity,” Rhodes said.To be sure, Microsoft is not the only well-known company contributing to this emerging field. Kaliya Young, a co-founder of the Internet Identity Workshop, a semi-annual gathering of ID experts and innovators, noted that other big corporations, including IBM, Accenture and RSA, belong to the DIF, and she credited IBM in particular for its work moving forward open standards for DIDs and a related W3C initiative called Verifiable Credentials.Further, Drummond Reed, chief trust officer at blockchain ID startup Evernym and chair of the Sovrin Trust Framework Working Group, noted that other companies, including all the “stewards” that operate nodes on Sovrin network (a group that includes IBM and Cisco), had been “endorsing DIDs and portable digital credentials as the foundation of decentralized identity for the past year.”But if it follows through on the white paper’s commitment to building products like the identity hub, Microsoft may be the first household name in a field to come up with a mass-market solution.However, some members of the ID community believe that work of this scale by a giant corporation like Microsoft should be done with more transparency.“I don’t know what Microsoft has developed, I haven’t seen any actual code,” Wayne Vaughan, CEO of blockchain data platform Tierion and a member of the DIF steering committee, told CoinDesk. “Microsoft has been soliciting input from the community, but their software development has largely been done behind closed doors, and now they are releasing it publicly. With that being said — it’s much better than nothing.”Vaughan believes that if corporations like Microsoft don’t make their work more transparent, other big players in possession of users’ identities, like Google and Facebook, might feel they are not involved and refuse to participate in the further adoption of the solutions that need to be broadly accepted to succeed.Also, the community wants to see Microsoft not only generating pieces of code, but participating in the development of common standards for the exchange of credentials, Reed told CoinDesk, adding that in his view, that standard should support zero-knowledge cryptography, which isn’t mentioned in the white paper.Manu Sporny, founder and CEO of payments startup Digital Bazaar and an active participant in several W3C working groups, shared similar thoughts.“The hope is that Microsoft will join the work on Decentralized Identifiers and Verifiable Credentials that are currently happening at W3C,” Sporny said. “I’m sure that in time they’ll do the right thing and join the international standards efforts in the space as they have done many times before.”Ankur Patel, principal program manager at Microsoft, responded to these concerns in an email to CoinDesk:“We are committed to establishing Open Standards and contributing to Open Source to make Decentralized Identity successful. As we make further progress, we will make appropriate contributions. With such a vibrant space, there are many such opportunities [to work on common standards]. We continue to evaluate and will participate in the ones that are most meaningful. We are committed to working with DIF, W3C, as well other industry or standards group that we believe can help realize a successful Decentralized Identity platform.”In any case, as the work on different concepts and implementations is accumulating, we can expect to see the first publicly available projects using decentralized identity come live in 2019, Young said, especially pointing at the work being done by the U.S. credit union consortium CULedger and the Canadian Province of British Columbia.“In the next five years we will see wide-scale adoption of the tools,” she said, concluding:“Identity is complex and decentralized identity solutions that put the user in the center of their own management of credentials is the only way through this complexity wormhole.”Microsoft image via Shutterstock"

one way in which Boost amended its pledge. In March 2014, when ...","Oct 24, 2018 at 04:00 UTC",Boost VC has officially backed crypto startup number 100.,"With the news, confirmed Tuesday by CoinDesk, the San Mateo incubator has finally fulfilled a funding pledge made all the way back in March 2014, when co-founders Adam Draper and Brayton Williams boldly declared they would invest in 100 bitcoin startups over the next three years.Though it may have taken a bit longer than planned, the milestone is perhaps a testament to the pre-seed fund, which has maintained a major emphasis on crypto since its earliest days, riding the twists and turns of an industry that has changed greatly in just a few short years.And that’s reflected in the numbers. Depending on how the deals get counted, Boost VC now says it’s made a little over 100 crypto investments. A few of its companies have pivoted away from crypto over time, so Draper no longer counts those toward the total, even if Boost initially wrote its check with the technology in mind.To that end, however, Draper told CoinDesk in an interview that the philosophy of the fund hasn’t changed.“It has always been about building the open financial system of the world,” he said.But a few pivots aren’t a bearish indicator – that’s the national course of investing. For Draper, the crypto portfolio has been a strong net positive.“In 2017, we started to feel the potential of what this could be, and now that potential is actually being built,” he said.He acknowledged that enthusiasm has dwindled among his peers in the venture community, but Boost has been through this before. He promised, “We will be writing more checks, because that’s my favorite time.”And despite hitting its goal, Boost hasn’t quit seeking crypto deals.Right now, it wants applications for its incubator, which is just one part of its larger investing program. Applications are open for “Tribe 12” now through the end of October (each group of startups goes into a “tribe,” and this will be the 12th such group).It’s looking for 20 companies to join a three-month incubator, where they will be provided with housing and office space, entrepreneurship coaching and a check from $50 to $100,000.“It’s been super fun,” Draper said of the ride to 100 companies. “You went from being the crazy one to having a group of people who were all crazy with you.”When Boost made its 100 investment commitment, he said it attracted all kinds of talented entrepreneurs starved for funding and support to Boost. He said they felt like “a beacon,” attracting this gang of believers together in a basement to imagine a new industry.Three years later, and it has become a real tech sector, with real stakes in the economy. Draper broke down some of the big takeaways from its pool of investments so far.Additional rounds of funding have been secured by 45 percent of the companies they backed, while 25 percent of the companies are dead. It’s had five crypto exits: Lawnmower (data), Leet (e-sports), Bitquick (distribution), Bitwall (micropayments) and Clevercoin (exchange). (Lawnmower was acquired by CoinDesk).Swell Rewards, also exited, but that’s an example of a company that Boost backed as a crypto company but that pivoted away from crypto by the time it sold.The exits so far don’t necessarily indicate big successes though. Venture capital typically looks at a 10-year time horizon for its bets to pay off. So far, its best investments (companies like Protocol Labs, Aragon, Ripio and Wyre) haven’t even approached an exit, because they are just building and growing.Boost’s failures, Draper said, resulted in focusing on ideas over founders. When an idea was hot and so it rushed to find a founder who was working on that idea, those deals never worked. Now Boost always picks founders over ideas.In Draper’s view, he’s always looking for founders that iterate. He wants to see constant iteration on product, getting it closer and closer to the users’ true problem. Also, he wants to see founders constant iterating on themselves, working to become the leader their company needs.Draper said, “Their reason for being in it needs to be pretty strong.”Close watchers of the space will note that there is one way in which Boost amended its pledge. In March 2014, when Draper committed to making 100 investments, he actually said he’d back 100 bitcoin startups. Since then, a lot of the companies its counting are definitely crypto, but they aren’t necessarily built for bitcoin.“The idea of 100 bitcoin companies — when we announced we were going to back 100 bitcoin companies — that was insane. That was an insane thought,” Draper said. At that time there really wasn’t a distinction between bitcoin and other kinds of crypto, Draper explained.“There was bitcoin and these whispers of other things, but everyone was trying to keep people focused on the main one,” he said. “We felt that the industry hadn’t focused enough to support divisions in the ecosystem.”Draper said that was an era when he watched “early adopters being rejected by venture capital,” he said. “I remember other VCs coming up to me and being like: ‘Is that bitcoin thing still a thing?'”But then ethereum came along and it offered the ERC-20 smart contract, which opened up a new way for funding starved crypto companies to raise money. “It unlocked this door in everyone’s head that said, ‘Hey maybe there can be more than one,'” he recalled.So, Boost followed the trend and opened up what it was looking for. Mostly it gets equity stakes in companies it backs, but it has also done token deals, such as for Decentraland. Draper said: “We have really done every kind of deal in the space.”Right now, it’s focused on getting those very early deals, from very new companies it will bring into its incubator. It really emphasizes the fact that it provides both housing and office space, because unlike a lot of VCs it seeks companies from all over the world.Half of Boost’s portfolio is international, Draper said, explaining, “Which, just working in the cryptocurrency world, you just have to be.”It’s also key to get them started in Silicon Valley because, he said, “Our thesis has always been: Entrepreneurs are everywhere but Silicon Valley has an infrastructure for founding a company that’s very, very helpful.”As for what he’s looking for, he and his partners keep an open mind.He said:“We’re looking for the craziest most impassioned people building magic.”Image via Boost VC Facebook "

Launched in 2013, CoinMarketCap listed its 2,000th crypto asset this month with the addition of Labh Coin (LABH). The milestone officially passed on October 3, there are now 2,112 cryptocurrencies tracked by the data site, the most trafficked according to data from Alexa.com. Data from the company shows a 3,000 percent increase in the number of cryptocurrencies on the website since it tracked just 66 assets in 2013. According to current figures, the site averages 422 newly listed cryptocurrencies per year which could be broken down to nearly 8 per week.The explosive creation of cryptocurrencies is surprising to many people, but not all.In fact, the founder of CoinMarketCap, Brandon Chez, told CoinDesk he anticipated the growth early on, although the reality of the situation has become a sight to behold.He explained:“It was apparent that the idea of cryptocurrencies wasn’t going away, especially being part of the emerging community that rallied around the promise of what a world with cryptocurrencies would look like. I did imagine at the start that it would reach this number in the near future, but it’s still quite amazing to see it finally come to fruition.”To Chez, the meaning of the rise in the number of cryptocurrencies is quite clear – the demand for secure representation of value still exceeds the number of preferred options. “This is something that cryptocurrencies and related technology excel at, so the crypto industry will definitely also benefit from this rise,” he said.After nearly a year of cryptocurrency price declines in what history will remember as “the infamous 2018 bear market,” one has to wonder if the poor market conditions will take a toll on the rate of cryptocurrency creation. Chez believes this to already be the case, an effect he calls asset creation “fatigue.”“I think the industry is fatigued with new asset creation right now in the bear market, especially since ICO prevalence has died down.”Much like time, though, bull markets seem to heal all wounds. Chez remains optimistic about the industry, envisioning the positive impact a bull market in 2019 could have on new projects. “Assuming a bull market in 2019, I expect token creation to speed back up as teams are willing to pour more capital into new projects as their existing crypto portfolios appreciate in value.”The rise in one of the site’s featured metrics, total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies, is perhaps even more staggering that the number of assets created. According to historical data provided from the CoinMarketCap, the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies aggregated from just seven listed assets on April 28th, 2013 (its first month in business) was just shy of $1.6 billion.That number today represents over $200 billion and a more than 13,000 percent increase since 2013. It should be noted the all-time high in total market capitalization of roughly $830 – set last January – represented an astounding growth percentage of 55,000 percent. CoinMarketCap doesn’t list every cryptocurrency in existence, however, so some competing websites with different listing criteria may provide data for many more. For example, CoinGecko is closing in on 3,000 listed cryptocurrencies with 2,982 at the time of writing. According to CoinMarketCap’s FAQ page, each listing must adhere to a few requirements. Each asset must “be a cryptocurrency or crypto token on a public exchange with an API that reports the last traded price and the last 24-hour trading volume.” Further, each “must have a non-zero trading volume on at least one supported exchange so a price can be determined, and for market cap ranking, an accurate circulating supply figure is required.”While the listing criteria remain the same, Chez does tend to identify different themes among the listed cryptocurrencies per year. When asked about the types of assets listed now versus years past, Chez simply answered “2018: security tokens.”Disclosure: The author holds BTC, AST, REQ, OMG, FUEL, 1st and AMP at the time of writing.Image Credit: CoinMarketCap/Facebook"

A letter of credit is a bank guarantee for a buyer’s payment to a seller.HSBC India’s head for global banking & markets, Hitendra Dave, said:“The use of blockchain is a significant step towards digitising trade. The overall efficiency it brings to trade finance ensures cost effectiveness, quicker turnaround and potentially unlocks liquidity for businesses.”Currently, importers and exporters use paper-based letters of credit to underpin transactions, with each party sending documents either by post or fax. This manual process not only slows the pace of trade, but also increases the costs.The blockchain-powered trade finance platform, on the other hand, is aimed to digitize that process, thereby saving time and cost.“The use of blockchain offers significant potential to reduce the timelines involved in exchange of export documentation from the extant 7 to 10 days to less than a day,” said Srikanth Venkatachari, joint chief financial officer at Reliance Industries.Mukesh Ambani image via World Economic Forum/Wikimedia"

Peer-to-peer exchanges in particular, referring to startups which refuse to register as a money services business and do not follow compliance laws, are often used to ensure users remain anonymous.Despite that, however, national and international agencies are training investigators in how to best track cryptocurrencies, he said.“We train investigators … in an effort to deter organizations from laundering proceeds or using cryptocurrencies to fund the purchase of fentanyl/opioids or other narcotics,” he said.ICE logo image via chrisdorney / Shutterstock"

Abel indicated that the organization and Coil will work together to implement the Interledger Protocol and explore ways to support “pro-poor payment systems.”Interledger is an interoperability protocol that allows payments across different crypto networks. The technology was initially co-developed by former Ripple CTO Stefan Thomas while he was still with the distributed ledger payments firm. The same tech now being used as the basis of Coil, which Thomas founded earlier this year, as CoinDesk reported.While further details on the new partnership are thus far sparse, Abel also mentioned Ripple in his tweets yesterday.The Gates Foundation announced its partnership with Ripple in October last year, when the two released an open-source software called Mojaloop – also focused on payment services to the poor and unbanked.Yesterday’s development appears to indicate that the Gates Foundation will work with Coil alongside Ripple to further develop the Mojaloop platform, which uses Interledger technology and connects the different parties in the payment system to facilitate real-time transactions.According to a press release published last year, Mojaloop is an “open-source software for creating payment platforms that will help unbanked people around the world access digital financial services.”Abel tweeted yesterday that Mojaloop “payments are in national currency of the given country, so that the system helps include and integrate the people (usually poor) who have historically been left out.”The Gates Foundation has been exploring blockchain technology applications since as early as 2015 as part of its effort to improve financial inclusion.Bill Gates image via Shutterstock"

As the technical underpinning for his interoperability protocol Polkadot, Substrate provides a generalized platform for blockchain development.According to Wood, who spoke to CoinDesk before the announcement, Substrate will help Polkadot reach its “main bet” – as a simple mechanism to allow people to build and launch their own blockchains.He told CoinDesk:“If everyone can build and deploy their own chain, then suddenly Polkadot becomes a much more interesting prospect.”Describing Substrate in more detail, Wood said that it provides an entirely general purpose platform for blockchain development.“Substrate is much more general than ethereum,” Wood said, adding: “We really wanted to make something pure and general.”Earlier this month, the Parity Technologies team announced it had used the Substrate codebase to deploy “Shasper” – the latest iteration of ethereum’s scaling roadmap, that mixes scaling solution sharding with consensus switch, proof-of-stake.While Substrate is already actionable, Wood emphasized that work remains to be done prior to its public release, specifically as relates to developer documentation, as well as “rounding some corners and removing any sharp edges.”“I’m giving it a three week countdown or something on these lines,” Wood said.At the conference, Wood also announced that the Substrate software will be relicensed to Apache 2, a more permissive, business-friendly license than the current GPL3.According to the Wood, the new license, “instantly opens the door to all of the Fortune 500 to actually experiment with it.”On top of that, Wood also presented a new Polkadot design that, in his words, allows for “infinite scalability.” This entails a tree-type structure of Polkadot chains running on Polkadot chains, something “cyclical and self-referential, what mathematicians call composability,” he said.Wood continued, “[It’s] a hierarchy of chains and the reason that it’s possible is that Polkadot can host itself, and every time you go down a level you can scale up 100 times.”Together with Polkadot – that is targeted for release in Q3 2019 – Wood said today’s Substrate release paves the way for blockchain networks of all kinds to coexist.He told CoinDesk:“The vision is pluralistic, multiplicative world with lots of teams doing their thing but being able to interoperate and intercommunicate in a trust-free, autonomous fashion.”It could seem a bit complicated, and sure enough, much of Wood’s presentation hinged on clarifying the distinction between Polkadot and Substrate.Speaking to Substrate specifically, Wood emphasized that it was different from ethereum in its upgradeability.Unlike on ethereum, protocol changes with Substrate do not require a system-wide upgrade, or a hard fork, to be activated.This will likely be attractive to many since as Wood put it, hard forks can be a “nightmare.” Because getting all the different stakeholders on board with new changes has proved difficult for many blockchain projects in the past, Wood contended that the long-term debates this arouses makes blockchains less able to keep up with technological developments.“Substrate-based chains can upgrade themselves, and this ability to change is useful for fixing hiccups along the way,” he told CoinDesk.This works through token holders casting votes on code changes, Wood said. And in this way, Substrate and Polkadot make power structures within networks clear and transparent – distinct from the informal governance that is the basis of most cryptocurrencies today, he argued.Wood concluded:“Having undefined governance doesn’t bestow power onto everyone, all it does is make obscure and opaque who are the real decision makers.”Gavin Wood at Web3 Summit image via CoinDesk"

Research. News; Learn; Research. Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Nov 8, 2018 at 10:00 UTC",“People don’t realize how much information is out in the open.”,"That’s Peter Szilagyi, an ethereum core developer who manages the software client Geth, referring to the fact that little attention has been paid to the blockchain’s underlying network layer, where information is sometimes exposed in complex and unpredictable ways.Indeed, there’s an awareness of the implications of such exposure, and it’s given rise to an ongoing acceleration in research on how to better obscure user data at the application level, which sits on top of the ethereum blockchain, a transparent system that publishes smart contract and transaction data.In an interview, Szilagyi described the peer-to-peer components that underlie the world’s second-largest blockchain by market capitalization as a “black magic thing.”This state of affairs was highlighted during his talk at the annual developer conference, Devcon4, in Prague last week. Szilágyi detailed a number of concerns that could cause user metadata to leak out over time – and under the worst-case scenario, provide the basis for an accurate, global map of ethereum user locations.During last Friday’s talk, Szilagyi focused on two ways in which this could happen, with a focus on websites like popular blockchain explorer, Etherscan, and “light clients” such as mobile or browser-based apps.“When people are transitioning away from full nodes they are giving up certain guarantees and I just want to highlight what potential issues might arise,” Szilagyi told CoinDesk.Szilagyi began encountering the issues following his pursuit of a side project: an alternative to Facebook that is decentralized and private-by-default. As a result of the research, Szilagyi said metadata leaks make it difficult to interact anonymously with others.“We don’t have that in ethereum,” Szilagyi explained. “The reason why these leaks began to bother me is because of that project.”Speaking on Friday, Szilágyi said that many of the problems are so deeply ingrained that it’s hard to address them without running the risk of breaking applications that run on top of ethereum. Still, the developer detailed methods that could alleviate the risk for users.“Most people in blockchain and ethereum they want to build on top, while there’s a team at the bottom doing the dirty work,” he told CoinDesk, adding:“It’s not that they are unsolvable problems, but someone needs to understand that they exist.”During his Devcon talk, Szilágyi broke down the various ways in which sensitive user information can be exposed by interacting with ethereum. Taking the example of Etherscan, Szilagyi said that a particular combination is revealed to the website when users access it – namely, a link between a user’s IP address and their ethereum address.And that’s notable because, as a unique computer identification number, an IP address reveals user location data.This information is then shared with Google Analytics and Etherscan. Plus, Etherscan’s underlying comment tool – a popular website comment add-on named Disqus – also receives this info, and further shares that activity with its partners.“Disqus actually reveals the IP-to-ethereum address mapping to Facebook, Twitter and Google Plus,” Szilagyi said.Disqus has 11 such integrations in total, such as YouTube, Vimeo and other services, that are given this information as well. The tool also contains other “weird trackers,” Szilágyi explained, including artificial intelligence platforms and data marketplaces.And that’s notable because it doesn’t just impact Etherscan, but any decentralized application (dapp) that uses the same tools.“This is an issue because you are essentially associating your IP-to-ethereum address mapping and you’re revealing that to a whole lot of services,” Szilagyi continued.Etherscan has taken measures to remove these features, Szilagyi said. Currently, it uses Google Analytics, but the team behind it is looking to remove that aspect from the website. Once having relied on an external ad company, Etherscan is taking steps to internalize the ad network as well.But other dapps that are affected may not be as proactive as Etherscan in addressing the leaks, according to Szilagyi.As he explained:“We get Etherscan to fix it, but can we get random dapp number 2,000 to fix it? Probably not. So users need to protect themselves, too.”The same information – IP-to-ethereum address – is shared when users access other services as well, Szilágyi continued, like Infura, MetaMask, and MyCryptoWallet.Szilagyi offered some other routes around this dilemma, including the use of the Tor network to hide IP addresses and the Brave browser to block online trackers.But there are other, more subtle ways that access to ethereum can expose sensitive information as well, according to the developer. Taking the example of light clients – the stripped down, low-storage way for ethereum users to access the network – Szilagyi said that there are two kinds of activity on the network that are highly traceable.The first is what is known as the “discovery protocol.”When light clients connect to the ethereum network, the IP is also revealed. Because light clients are continuously reconnecting over time, the discovery protocol reveals an accurate map of user location.“Every time I connect to the network I am actually revealing to the network that this machine which last week is in Berlin, this week was in Prague,” Szilagyi said.This location data is public, so in theory, anyone can scan the network to build a highly accurate, global map of ethereum user locations.“If you are willing to do this, for example, every day, just try to scan the network every day, then actually you can create an extremely accurate history of where each individual ethereum node was moving over time,” Szilagyi said.Additionally, key to how light clients work is the way in which the software minimizes activity by connecting to addresses that are associated with a user. But while this approach reduces bandwidth, latency and traffic, the impact is that IP and address relationships are rendered explicit on the network.“Light servers will be able to statistically map out that this particular IP address is interested in one particular address,” Szilagyi said.Similarly to the discovery protocol, this information can be easily accessible. And unfortunately, connecting over Tor will actually damage the reliability of the light client.“Now we don’t a world map of moving IPs, now we have a world map of moving ethereum addresses,” Szilagyi said, adding:“And again, similar to the ethereum discovery protocol, this can be done publicly by everyone.”Unfortunately, according Szilagyi, there’s no simple fix for many of these problems, as some are inherent to how light clients and explorers function. But, speaking to the audience on Friday, the developer had precise recommendations to share with ethereum users and developers going forward.Specifically, Szilagyi broke down three ways in which this information can be better concealed in the near-term.First, he argued that users should run full nodes. While more hardware intensive, full nodes mean you can store all data locally and can access that data without interacting with anyone else. Additionally, because full nodes verify that ethereum’s underlying state is correct, running a full node comes with security benefits as well.“Although people don’t like full nodes, full nodes are actually the best anonymizers in the ethereum ecosystem,” Szilagyi said.Secondly, Szilagyi contended that developers should look to the work that has been done by anonymizing network layers, such as Tor browser and I2P, for research on how to better conceal metadata leaks at the network level.“Privacy on ethereum is bad, really, really bad. But that doesn’t mean that it’s an impossible task to solve,” he said. “There have been 20 years of research going into how to do this properly, so let’s at least try to learn from their results and try to fix it.”Lastly, Szilagy urged developers not to blame users for bad privacy practice when interacting with ethereum. He also noted that many users may be unaware that options like the Tor browser exist in the first place.As such, Szilagy said: “It’s kind of up to us as dapp and platform developers to figure it out and fix it.”With this in mind, Szilagy ended on a note of caution. Pointing to Facebook as an example, the developer said that when privacy-enforcing characteristics aren’t embedded at the start, such an approach might carry repercussions in the future.“I don’t think Facebook was created to gather user data, it wasn’t created to abuse elections, that kind of just happened,” Szilagy said, concluding:“We don’t want to fix it to protect users from not only external attacks – I think it’s really important to also highlight that we want to protect users from ourselves too.”Devcon image via CoinDesk archives  "

The two stated this approach would avoid further risks for Fisco and users on the platform.Zaif, currently one of the 16 licensed crypto exchanges in Japan, experienced the hack on Sept. 20, when some $60 million in cryptocurrencies were stolen, including nearly 6,000 bitcoin. Other compromised assets included bitcoin cash and the monacoin cryptocurrency, as CoinDesk reported at the time.The statement indicated that Fisco would use its own bitcoin and bitcoin cash to refund users who had lost holdings of the two crypto assets. According to a statement by Fisco, the company started operating a bitcoin exchange in August 2016.As for those who lost monacoin, Tech Bureau said Fisco would pay back users in the Japanese yen at a rate of 144.548 yen, or $1.28, per token. At press time, one monacoin is trading at $1.14, according to CoinMarketCap data.Immediately after the hack, Tech Bureau had made an initial agreement with Fisco that the latter would offer 5 billion yen, or $44.5 million, to support Zaif’s compensation plan and to acquire a major stake in the platform. Yet after negotiations, the initial plan was changed to encompass a full transfer of the company.The two now expect to host shareholder meetings in October before they execute the business transfer on Nov. 22.Once the process is complete, Tech Bureau plans to dissolve its cryptocurrency exchange business and cancel its license with the Financial Services Agency, Japan’s financial market regulator, the statement said.Japanese yen image via Shutterstock"

Decentralized apps (dapps) are one area he sees drawing potential new users into the space.“The motivation here is no one wants to build in an ecosystem that customers can’t get access to, so it’s really important to build those on-ramps … [Vault] doesn’t present them with a lot of technical information, just gives them a way to start using [dapps],” Egan said.Moreover, Vault will not list token prices or enable the trading of tokens, he said, adding:“It’s like the early days of baseball cards, you didn’t buy them to make 50 [times] their value later, you bought them to own them or trade them with your friends. I think that’s the big opportunity with collectibles … you want to have these things because you want them, not because you’re chasing [prices] … I think that’s what the future is, the utility is coming.”“You can kind of see it in the [user interface] … the application doesn’t attempt to encourage this idea of profit-seeking, it encourages this idea of holding things because you believe it has intrinsic value,” he said.He likened his vision for Vault to Apple’s iOS, noting that while developers could already create apps for smartphones, introducing an ecosystem that made it easy to share and use apps spurred adoption.“Our desire is to be the most used crypto wallet and sort of knock down barriers in terms of getting into the space,” he said. “I think collectibles have the best chance of bringing us out of the early adopter phase and moving into mainstream use, because most people are excited about these games.”As part of its interface, users can add friends as contacts, negating the need to memorize or share complicated wallet addresses.“We’re not a trading desk, we’re not a Coinbase, we’re not a Gemini, we’re trying to be a utility. I think if we’re successful long-term, you’ll begin to see this ecosystem flourish like you saw the web flourish,” he concluded.Miniatures playing image via Shutterstock"
