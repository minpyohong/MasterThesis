and Cointelegraph takes a look at the whirlwind decade since its ...","Oct 31, 2018","October 31 marks the ten year anniversary of the release of the Bitcoin white paper, which was authored by Satoshi Nakamoto, and whose identity still remains a mystery.","In this relatively short period of time, Bitcoin has challenged the way modern society looks at global finance and banking, and has been the catalyst for the birth of over a thousand different cryptocurrencies as well as many more blockchain projects.Its history has been full of highs and lows, as the volatile cryptocurrency has battled through years fraught with controversy and success. With the release of the white paper, a movement was set in motion that has left an indelible mark across a multitude of industries.Cointelegraph takes a look at some of the most memorable and infamous moments over the 10 years since Bitcoin was brought to life.On Aug. 18, 2008, the Bitcoin.org domain was registered by an anonymous entity as a precursor to the body of work that would describe the intricacies of the Bitcoin protocol.This came to life with the publishing of the Bitcoin white paper on Oct. 31, 2008. Titled “Bitcoin - A peer-to-peer electronic cash system,” the initial nine page document was distributed on cypherpunk mailing list in November 2008.On Jan. 3, 2009, Nakamoto successfully created the Genesis Block, the founding block of the Bitcoin blockchain. The Genesis block was hardcoded into the Bitcoin software and the 50 BTC, which were created cannot be spent, due to the way the code was written. The exact reasons for this aren’t known, just another mystery to add to Satoshi’s story.The average time between the creation of new blocks is 10 minutes, but it took a full six days before the next block was added to the Bitcoin blockchain, according to the timestamps of those specific blocks.There are a number of speculative theories why it took so long, ranging from Nakamoto using the next few days to mine the first block to test the network, while other have even suggested that he waited six days in a figurative reenactment of the book of Genesis from the Bible, in which God created the world in six days.Nevertheless, the first ever Bitcoin transaction took place on Jan. 12, 2009, between Nakamoto and the late Hal Finney, who was an early contributor to the project. Nakamoto sent Finney 10 BTC as a test, while the computer scientist began mining blocks himself.Ten months later, on Oct. 5, 2009, the New Liberty Standard set the first ever Bitcoin exchange rate against the dollar. At the time, $1 equalled 2300.03 BTC.The first ever transaction of Bitcoin for physical goods took place on May 22, 2010. The famous Bitcoin Pizza saw two pizzas bought for 10,000 BTC by Laszlo Hanyecz. The programmer had offered users on a Bitcointalk.org forum the BTC in exchange for two pizzas. A teenager named Jeremy Sturdivant, nicknamed Jercos, accepted the Bitcoin and sent Hanyecz two pizzas from Papa John’s.The transaction is a comical milestone for Bitcoin, but it is staggering what one could buy with the same amount of BTC today and is often used as a reference point for the rise in value of the preeminent cryptocurrency.On Feb. 9, 2011, Bitcoin reached parity with the US dollar at a 1:1 ratio. The milestone would mark the start of a tumultuous period for Bitcoin. In the space of just four months, Bitcoin skyrocketed from $1 to $31.91.Four days later, on June 12, 2011, Bitcoin plummeted in value to $10.25, in the first major correction experienced by the Bitcoin community. This was also exacerbated by the first major security breach of Mt. Gox on June 19, 2011.After a relatively quiet six months, the price of Bitcoin dropped again, following news that e-wallet company Paxum had stopped accepting BTC. This period of time marks the first real instance where Bitcoin experienced high volatility and humbling corrections.On Nov. 28, 2012, the first halving of Bitcoin rewards occured, when the block reward reduced from 50 to 25 BTC after the 210,000 block was mined. The price of BTC continued to climb into 2013, and the cryptocurrency went past the $200 mark for the first time ever on April 9.Things went downhill just ahead of the fifth anniversary of the Bitcoin white paper, as the infamous dark web site, Silk Road, was shutdown and over 26,000 BTC were seized. The price of Bitcoin dropped from $139 to $109 in a few short hours.By November 2013, the value of a single Bitcoin reached parity with an ounce of gold, over $1000. This feat was short lived though, as the price of Bitcoin tanked once again the following month, to as low as $600, before moving between that range for the next two months.In February 2014, rumors began circulating that Mt. Gox had been hacked and the exchange formally suspended trading that month after a series of “thefts.” By the end of February, Mt. Gox CEO, Mark Karpeles, had resigned from his position on the board of the Bitcoin Foundation amid controversy at the exchange.In March, the company filed for bankruptcy protection with debts over $60 million declared by its legal team at the time. Around 850,000 BTC had been “lost,” with Karpeles blaming technical issues with the Bitcoin protocol.Bitcoin foundation’s Gavin Andresen refuted these claims at the time, pointing to problems with Mt. Gox’s wallet software.While the Mt. Gox debacle, and the controversy surrounding the Silk Road, gave a negative perception towards Bitcoin, the next couple of years marked the first real waves of mainstream adoption by big name companies.On Dec. 11, 2014, Microsoft began accepting Bitcoin payments, marking a big milestone for Bitcoin approval by global corporations.Six years after Satoshi released the Bitcoin white paper, the cryptocurrency appeared on the front page of The Economist on Oct. 31, 2015.Amid these positive moves for the cryptocurrency, the value of Bitcoin went through a two year period of relative stability.On July 9, 2016 the second halving of Bitcoin mining rewards took place, with the BTC reward dropping to 12.5 for every block mined.The dawn of 2017 marked the start of what would be the biggest bull run in Bitcoin history, the most prolific year for the cryptocurrency, and its move into mainstream consciousness. Having breached the $1,000 mark three years previously, Bitcoin hit the mark once again on Jan. 2, 2017.The Winklevoss twins, who successfully sued Mark Zuckerberg for stealing intellectual property that led to the creation of Facebook, grabbed headlines in Mar. 10, 2017. The brothers had filed an application to launch, Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF), which was turned down by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).The price of Bitcoin had surged past its previous all time high in the week leading up to this decision, in anticipation of the ETF approval. The value of the cryptocurrency dipped for a couple of months before a slow and steady rally began.On June 11, Bitcoin crossed the $3,000 mark for the first time ever, amid an ongoing debate around the possible measures to address scaling issues affecting Bitcoin.This came to an infamous end on Aug. 1, 2017, as a small part of the Bitcoin community couldn’t agree with proposed changes to the protocol. The likes of Roger Ver, advocated for an increase in the blocksize, which ended in a hard fork from the original Bitcoin blockchain - giving birth to Bitcoin Cash.A few weeks later, on Aug. 23, 2017, the SegWit soft fork activated, as the outcome to what originally led to the Bitcoin Cash hard fork, but also to a decision which was made to support SegWit.Still, Bitcoin continued a surge in value and surpassed the $5,000 mark on Sep. 2, 2017.A couple weeks of volatility followed, with the price of BTC dropping down to $3,000 before rebounding, after China banned ICOs and cryptocurrency exchanges from operating in the country. Another compounding factor were infamous comments made by JPMorgan Chase CEO, Jamie Dimon, calling Bitcoin a “fraud.”After the dust had settled, Bitcoin set off on a mind-bending bull run from October onwards. The cryptocurrency surpassed $10,000 in value on November 29, and then breached the $11,000 mark a few hours later.The cryptocurrency continued to gain value as investors scrambled to join in on the action. A driving factor was the perception that the launch of Bitcoin futures in December 2017, would cause an influx of institutional money into Bitcoin, further stimulating the price of the cryptocurrency.With no sign of stopping, Bitcoin finally breached the $20,000 mark, marking an historic high for the cryptocurrency. Sadly for the community, the price of Bitcoin slumped back down to the $13,000 mark by Dec. 31, 2017.After the lofty highs of 2017, the cryptocurrency community had to endure a tough start to the new year. January saw the price of Bitcoin drop as low as $10,000 as a wave of FUD took over the markets.Murmurs of a cryptocurrency ban in South Korea contributed to the correction, as did talk of China ramping up existing cryptocurrency sanctions, as well as Facebook’s ban of cryptocurrency and ICO adverts on its platform.Things looked even more bleak in February, as Bitcoin slumped to the $7,000 mark on Feb. 6, 2018.On the very same day, the Commodities and Future Trading Commission and the SEC held a highly anticipated hearing focused on cryptocurrencies, initial coin offerings (ICO), and blockchain technology.The meeting ended up being somewhat of a lifeline, as the regulatory bodies produced positive outlooks for Bitcoin, while promising to provide an environment that protects investors from the volatility and inherent risks of participating in ICO funding.The cryptocurrency markets rebounded after the hearing, but the next few months continued to be relatively unstable.In March, Twitter followed in the footsteps of Facebook by banning cryptocurrency advertising, while Google also announced plans to stop cryptocurrency advertising through the AdWords service.The slow slide in value of Bitcoin hit its lowest point on June 24, 2018. According to data from CoinMarketCap, the cryptocurrency went as low as $5,868.Despite the mid-year slump, the markets slowly began to look up in the lead up to the SEC’s decisions on a number of anticipated ETF proposals.Unfortunately, optimistic investors were left disappointed as the SEC rejected all nine Bitcoin ETFs due to concerns of “inadequate resistance to price manipulation” on August 2.While the final decision over these proposed ETFs has been pushed further into the future, there is a silver lining for Bitcoin at this present moment in time.On October 17, Bitcoin market volatility hit a 17 month record low, with its highest level of stability in over 12 months. This prompted various industry experts to put out optimistic forecasts for the cryptocurrency.As we celebrate the 10 year anniversary of the Bitcoin white paper’ release to the general public, it is important to recognize this topsy-turvy journey over the past decade.While it has been fraught with difficulty, the cryptocurrency has endured and still remains the most valuable in terms of market capitalization - an impressive feat considering over a thousand cryptocurrencies have been launched since Bitcoin’s inception in 2008."

“intellectual experiment” that could take years to succeed if it does not 
fail.","Oct 30, 2018","Bitcoin ""Patient Zero"" Wences Casares, the founder of Bitcoin (BTC) wallet startup Xapo, said that the seminal cryptocurrency may take years to prove successful, in an interview with Bloomberg Oct. 29.","In an interview with Bloomberg, Casares argued that BTC is an “intellectual experiment,” and it could be several years before it proves successful. “It may work, it might not work,” said Casares, noting that Bitcoin is in its early stages and that “we are in the equivalent of 1992 for the Internet.” However, Casares suggested that the probability of success is still greater than failure.Argentina-born Casares has been called the “patient zero” of Bitcoin for serving as a catalyst for Silicon Valley’s interest in the seminal cryptocurrency. In 2014, Casares established Xapo, a company that offers a Bitcoin wallet combined with cold storage and a BTC-based debit card.Casares forecasted that it will take at least seven years to determine whether BTC is successful, and if it does, BTC will become a non-political global standard of value and settlement. Casares stated:“We need a nonpolitical standard of value and we don’t have one. So a world in which we [see it] is a world [in which] when you ask for the price of Turkish lira, you get a price in bits, when you ask for the price of a barrel of oil, you get a price in bits, when as for the price of the U.S. dollar you get a price in bits.”Notably, the Bitcoin advocate said that it will not replace fiat currencies as ""it does not make sense."" He added that the idea that a blockchain can “change the idea of an asset, that already derives its value from a central authority [...] its really nonsensical and does not make any sense.”Casares has previously proclaimed his vision of BTC becoming an apolitical standard of value. Last year Casares predicted that the price of BTC “will hit $1 million in 5–10 years.”Regarding blockchain, Casares stated in January that there would eventually come about a single “robust” blockchain to move value globally. Per Casares, the future of crypto lies in the cooperation around a singular, robust blockchain, and in his opinion BTC is the most likely to be the blockchain of choice."

stated that Bitcoins and altcoins have constituted a “new institutional ...","Nov 6, 2018","On October 31, multinational investment bank and financial services company, Morgan Stanley, released their latest report on Bitcoin. The report, entitled “Update: Bitcoin, Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain,” stated that Bitcoins and altcoins have constituted a “new institutional investment class” since 2017.","In comparison to Morgan Stanley’s 2017 report on Bitcoin, their 2018 outlook is bullish. The report contains an overview of both how Bitcoin has evolved, and how its investment purpose has changed throughout its existence. Morgan Stanley analysts also touched upon the recent stablecoin trend and both central bank and regulator reactions to Bitcoin for the last six months. The report listed several shortcomings that persist for Bitcoin, such as energy consumption and a lack of a robust regulatory framework. Analysts have revealed about the “surprising” change in funding flowing into the sector, along with an increasing trend for crypto-tied futures.This latest development, described by the bank as “surprising,” comes against the backdrop of Morgan Stanley offering trading in derivatives tied to the largest cryptocurrency. It’s important to note that the bank is not actually planning to trade Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies directly but rather to offer Bitcoin swap trading tied to futures contracts. Earlier this year, CEO James Gorman said that a trading desk specializing in derivatives tied to digital assets could be a potential service offered to clients.Futures are contracts in which the buyer has agreed to purchase an asset at an agreed time and price in the future. The same arrangement stands for the party selling the asset as well. These contracts note both the quality and quantity of the assets that are being traded, standardized, and either require physical delivery of the asset being traded or are settled in cash.According to Bloomberg, the bank already has the measures in place to offer Bitcoin swap trading, however, it will not officially launch any initiative without first ascertaining the level of institutional client demand and completing a thorough internal approval process.As previously reported by Cointelegraph, Morgan Stanley told clients that Bitcoin was similar to the Nasdaq, albeit moving “15x” faster. The bank also predicted that financial markets would increasingly lean towards the use of crypto in the future:“Over the coming years, we think that the market focus could turn increasingly toward cross trades between cryptocurrencies/tokens, which would transact via distributed ledgers only and not via the banking system.”In spite of the bank’s apparent readiness to roll out this latest venture, the fact that their list of institutions actually willing to clear Bitcoin futures hasn’t changed since their 2017 report tempers any short-term hope for wider adoption:The report made specific mention of perhaps the most prominent recent development in the cryptocurrency sector: stablecoin. The stablecoin trend began in late 2017 and experienced a burst throughout the summer of 2018, with several industry giants launching stablecoins of their own.Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to keep volatility to an absolute minimum and are usually valued against either fiat currencies such as the U.S. dollar, commodities, and other crypto assets.While emphasising that 54 percent of total cryptocurrency value remains Bitcoin, the report notes how the introduction of stablecoins to the crypto market resulted in a share of trading volumes being siphoned away from BTC. Analysts write that this aided the subsequent fall in prices that resulted in the current bear market.According to the report, these consequences are due to the fact that a large quantity of the existing exchanges do not currently facilitate trading crypto to fiat. The researchers state that this is down to the fact that crypto->fiat trading involves going through the mainstream banking sectors and incurs a higher fee. The report then explains that the resulting slide in Bitcoin prices also had a knock-on effect across the sector, meaning that owners seeking to extricate themselves from Bitcoin holdings needed to find an asset whose valuation more closely reflected the valuation of the U.S. dollar.Morgan Stanley researchers also emphasize that, in spite of the positive support for the sector’s recent trend, not all stablecoins will survive. The report subsequently postulates that only stablecoins with low transaction costs, high liquidity, and a concrete regulatory structure will be successful in garnering widespread adoption.While the report does not cast aspersions of the future welfare of any specific stablecoins, it does mention four coins to its readers:USDT (Tether) receives a mention as being responsible for the initial decrease in BTC trading volumes and for trading at roughly the same price as the U.S. dollar. However, the report does not touch on the issue of USDT losing its dollar pegging after dipping below the $1 mark in October 2018. The drop in valuation resulted in an apparent sell-off of the tokens in October and created a lack of confidence among traders.Although Tether was previously one of the most ubiquitous and commonly traded stablecoins, it has recently been embroiled in a series of scandals over its lack of transparency and management of reserves. Tether has since rebounded after finding a new banking partner and is “fully backed” by USD, according to a new statement.Also receiving mention from the Morgan Stanley report is GUSD, launched in September by billionaire twins and established players in the crypto industry, Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss.The Gemini dollar (GUSD) is backed by U.S. dollars reserved in a bank located in the United States and is eligible for FDIC “pass-through deposit insurance.” The twins hope for Gemini to revolutionize the stablecoin market by eradicating time delays between 24/7 crypto markets and fiat markets that operate under time restriction.Centre’s stablecoin, USDC, is the third stablecoin named by the report. Centre, a consortium that includes Bitcoin mining giant Bitmain Technologies Ltd., is set to act as the platform for deposits and any fiat conversions for the new stablecoin. The consortium is a subsidiary of Circle, but, according to Bloomberg, the firm announced plans to transform it into an independent organization.USDC is starting off with a different approach to compliance than its most prominent competitor, Tether. Part of the agreement for issuers is that they allow certified auditors to monitor and review their USDC reserves.The fourth stablecoin mentioned in the report is DGX (Digix Gold Coin). DGX is equal to 99.99 percent LBMA approved gold in USD. The corresponding gold is held in Digix’s bank in Singapore.Another key aspect of the Morgan Stanley report is what it calls crypto’s “rapidly morphing thesis.” The report traces the evolution of Bitcoin from its varying roles of digital cash, a new fundraising mechanism, a method for the store of value, to its most recent incarnation as a “new institutional investment class.”The report showed that 48 percent of funding for Bitcoin came from hedge funds. A further 48 percent came from venture capital with the remaining 3 percent found in the form of private equity.In terms of the origins of Bitcoin investment, over half has come from U.S. based investors, with China and Hong Kong coming in second at 9 percent and the U.K. – third at 6 percent.Alongside the financial statistics, the report also emphasizes that big players from the financial mainstream have tossed their hats into the ring. Analysts draw attention to Bain capital’s $15 million Series B funding round for Seed Cx Institutional Trading Platform, Goldman Sachs & Galaxy Digital’s $58.5 million investment in BitGo, as well as Coinbase’s $8 billion valuation, drawing comparisons with Charles Schwab, Fidelity, and Nasdaq.The report also touches upon the new tendency for crypto players to actively cooperate with institutions, giving the prominent example of the Winklevoss twins’ company, Gemini Trust, hiring Nasdaq to conduct market surveillance.In spite of the seemingly bullish presentation on institutional involvement, the report goes on to mention that asset managers are still unwilling to take on reputational risks in an underdeveloped regulatory environment. The bank also highlighted the lack of a custodian solution to hold both cryptocurrency and private keys along with that of large financial institutions currently invested.The report also reveals a change in approach from central banks. According to the Morgan Stanley analysts, the discussion surrounding digital versions of paper notes and coins has reduced, with the exception of Sweden who are yet to decide on the introduction of an e-Krona.The report documents that the South Korean province of Gyeongbuk is looking to replace city-issued gifts certificates with a digital alternative, along with Thailand’s research into facilitating liquidity and risk management. India’s investigation into the cost efficiency of a digital rupee is also mentioned in the report, but no analysis is given on the progress of these projects nor are any forecasts made on their future success.Another section of the report is dedicated to comments from regulators. The Morgan Stanley report documents that regulators are still skittish about how best to classify cryptocurrencies, as well as how to fit them into an appropriate framework in which they can be traded safely and legally.William Hinman, head of the Division of Corporate Finance for the SEC, is quoted in the report, stating that more work needs to be done on establishing client expectations and classifying cryptocurrencies:“Central to determining whether a security is being sold is how it is being sold and the reasonable expectations of purchasers.”Chairman of CFTC, Christopher Giancarlo, was also documented by Morgan Stanley as being bullish about cryptocurrencies and their potential to become a concrete part of the financial mainstream:“I personally think that cryptocurrencies are here to stay. I think there is a future for them. I’m not sure they ever come to rival the dollar or other hard currencies, but there’s a whole section of the world that really is hungry for functioning currencies that they can’t find in their local currencies. There’s 140 countries in the world, every one of them has a currency. Probably two-thirds are not worth the polymer or the paper they’re written on, and those parts of the world rely on hard currencies. Bitcoin [or another] cryptocurrency may solve some of the problems.”In light of the fact that Morgan Stanley has been using blockchain-based technology to carry out process transactions and to back up records since March 2016, it might not come as a surprise that the bank listed several benefits that it believes the technology is capable of bringing to the table.According to the report, blockchain is best implemented for B2B transactions in which the participants on both sides of the transaction are trusted. The bank also documents that blockchain technology provides benefits for cross border payments, a technique increasingly used by migrant workers to send money back to their home countries as remittances. Researchers also noted that there are potential benefits in KYC and client data handling sectors, though they also mentioned that APIs may well be more efficient.The report provides a list of the many financial institutions that are actively trialling or implementing blockchain technology:Researchers also provided examples of key infrastructure use cases of blockchain, in particular for banks:Although the report represents a significant change in both Morgan Stanley’s attitude as well as in other major financial institutions, it does highlight several areas where it remained apprehensive.The report touches on one of the most commonly discussed drawbacks of blockchain and cryptocurrency: electricity use. Morgan Stanley analysts predict that the decline in mining equipment price will drive electricity use higher:This latest graph builds on the same concerns highlighted in Morgan Stanley’s 2017 report:Bitcoin’s considerable energy usage has been widely reported. Earlier this year, Cointelegraph reported on how Bitcoin was both on track to use 0.5 percent of the world’s energy by the end of 2018 and face an impact to its profitability over electricity costs in the summer months.The report dedicated an entire page to demonstrate the extent to which it believes AI and blockchain are “mortal enemies.” Curiously enough, the extent of their conviction did not stretch to providing any justification for this notion whatsoever:Morgan Stanley research on cryptocurrency is released on a regular basis. The bank’s previous report on crypto, entitled “Diversified Financials: Exploring global cryptocurrency regulations” was released on Aug. 21. The last report released by Morgan Stanley to focus on Bitcoin was released in January 2018. The November 2018 report is the first to document a change in institutional investment patterns and to document the trend for crypto-tied futures. The bullish outlook of the report could well be indicative of wider readiness for big institutional players to more readily adopt Bitcoin in the 2019 financial year."

markets more volatile. 16970 Total views. 270 ...","Oct 11, 2018","A new study by blockchain research firm Chainalysis shows that Bitcoin (BTC) whales are not responsible for price volatility. The study examined the 32 largest BTC wallets, which reportedly represent 1 million BTC, or around $6.3 billion.","BTC whales are individuals or entities that own large amount of the cryptocurrency and are said to exert influence on the market volatility. However, Chainalysis’ data reveals that BTC whales are “a diverse group, and only about a third of them are active traders. And while these trading whales certainly have the capability of executing transactions large enough to move the market, they have, on net, traded against the herd, buying on price declines.”In the course of the research, the firm divided the 32 wallets into four groups. The most active category consists of nine wallets belonging to traders, who regularly conduct transactions with BTC on exchanges. This group of BTC owners controls more than 332,000 coins, worth over $2 billion, but only one-third of it actively trades BTC. Most of these traders reportedly entered the market in 2017.The second group is represented by miners and early adopters, which include 15 investors also holding a total of 332,000 coins. The trading activity of this group is reportedly “extremely low,” although the report states that many of them made significant divestments from 2016–2017 when BTC prices soared.The two remaining categories include three wallets of “criminals” with over 125,000 coins and $790 million in asset value, and “lost” wallets representing over 212,000 coins worth about $1.3 billion. The study found that since 2011, there have not been any transactions from the “lost” wallets at all.The analysis of the trading whales found that they do not intensify volatility, as during the major declines in 2017 and 2018 thay were net buyers of BTC. The study further reads:“That net activity demonstrates that trading whales were not selling off Bitcoin in any mass amount, but rather were net receivers of Bitcoin from exchanges in late 2016 and 2017. This indicates that trading whales were, in aggregate, buying on declines and, consequently, were a stabilizing, rather than destabilizing factor in the market...”Back in December 2017, following the BTC price surge to $19,000, the community became concerned about what would happen if 1,000 people owning 40 percent of all existing BTC cash it out simultaneously.  A coordinated strike by a host of whales, selling off enough coins to cause a glut in the market, could sink prices to the advantage of certain traders.Kyle Samani, managing partner at Multicoin Capital, said then that he “think[s] there are a few hundred guys.

$250,000 in four years, and eventually replace “political money.”.","Nov 10, 2018","Venture capital investor Tim Draper reaffirmed his prediction that the Bitcoin (BTC) price will reach $250,000 by 2022, during a panel discussion at the Web Summit summit conference Nov. 6","Draper initially predicted that the BTC price will surge up to $250,000 in April of this year. “Believe it, it’s going to happen – they’re going to think you’re crazy but believe it, it’s happening, it’s going to be awesome!,” Draper said then.When asked at the recent Web Summit conference whether he still thinks the BTC price will experience a 40 times return in a span of four years and reach $250,000, Draper said:“Yes. We are talking [...] about five percent market share to get to $250,000. That seems like a drop in a bucket and all we need to really do is make it so that Bitcoin can be used to buy Starbucks coffee, and all of a sudden the world just opens up and then they say ‘I’ve got this choice.’ [...] Do I want a currency that I can take from country to country [...] or do I want one that sticks me in one country or one geographic area and I can’t use it anywhere else?”Draper also questioned the need for fiat currencies or “political currencies,” stating “why do we even trust currencies that are determined by some weird political party or another?” In Draper’s view, banks issue money “whenever they feel like it for whatever reason they want it,” and the emergence of a “totally apolitical,” global, and open currency would cede control of money from banks to common people, he explained.Speaking at the GovTech Pioneers conference in May, Draper presented his vision of a future in which blockchain utilizing smart contracts in conjunction with artificial intelligence (AI) will massively change the role and responsibilities of states. ""If we combine Bitcoin, blockchain with smart contracts and artificial intelligence, we could create the perfect bureaucracy,"" he said.In September, Draper made another prediction, saying that the total cryptocurrency market capitalization will hit $80 trillion in the next 15 years. Draper argued that the significant slide in the cryptocurrency market in previous months is attributed to people who had not adopted digital currencies as a new asset class. Draper said then:“Cryptocurrency will go after trillion dollar markets — these are finance, healthcare and insurance, banking and investment banking, and governments.”"

Referring to his now-notorious statement that Nakamoto's invention is little more than a “fraud,” the CEO told the audience:“I never changed what I said, I just regret having said it. I didn’t want to be the spokesman against Bitcoin. I don’t really give a sh*t, that’s the point. Blockchain is real, it’s technology, but Bitcoin is not the same as a fiat currency.”As previously reported, Dimon’s circuitous history with Bitcoin dates back to September 2017, when his critical rhetoric caused a sharp fleeting dent to the asset’s price.After pledging to keep silent on the matter, this January the CEO again became embroiled in Bitcoin talk, saying he regretted his earlier choice of words, all the while reaffirming his avowed indifference.Despite its CEO’s ambivalence, senior figures within the banking giant have hinted at a potentially more receptive stance towards the crypto space, although the institution’s signals regarding crypto are resoundingly mixed.As Dimon’s latest comment suggests, JPMorgan is more straightforwardly pro-blockchain: a study into JPMorgan’s digital transformation published earlier this month underscored that blockchain represents a key technology for the bank’s roadmap.In late September, JPMorgan expanded its blockchain-based payment platform to over 75 multinational banks, as part of a collective bid to stave off competition from outside of the banking sector."

Bitcoin Cash Hard Fork Draws Closer. Will Bitcoin Cash split? An ...","Nov 13, 2018","Born out of the original Bitcoin blockchain on August 1, 2017, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has split the cryptocurrency community into warring factions with their own arguments, verbal skirmishes, leaders, convictions and occasional get-togethers. On November 15, BCH developers are preparing to undergo its next hard fork, a split of the blockchain, which can give birth to new tokens named Bitcoin SV (Satoshi’s Vision), Bitcoin Unlimited and Bitcoin ABC.","The Bitcoin evolution has been constantly debated within the developers community, who had opposing views on what technology to implement and what rewards miners should receive.In July 2017, a part of the Bitcoin community, headed by Roger Ver, proclaimed that the adoption of Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP 91) protocol without an increase in the Bitcoin’s block size was a one-sided offering only to those who wished to use Bitcoin for investing, and not as a currency for carrying out anonymous transactions, as had originally been prescribed by Satoshi Nakamoto. Part of the community stepped against the proposed SegWit improvement plan that Bitcoin had intended to introduce to increase block capacity, and declared that they wanted a split of the blockchain. As a result, Bitcoin Cash was born on August 1, 2017.The new hard fork scheduled for November 15 has served as another splash of fuel into the bonfire of the ideological debate. In essence, there are three proposals for the implementation of the Bitcoin Cash network in the form of Bitcoin ABC, Bitcoin Unlimited, and Bitcoin SV. Each of these has its own pros and cons.“Conservative wing”No “radical changes” to Bitcoin CashFavoured by: Roger VerFounded: July 2017Miners’ votes: 49 percentSupporters: Bitmain, Binance, Bitcoin.com, CoinbaseThe Bitcoin ABC split campaign is based on the belief that the basic structure of Bitcoin Cash is “sound”, and “does not need any radical change”. However, improving some of the network features is necessary for its further development, according to the faction’s roadmap. Proposed upgrades include smart contract abilities, oracle services, and scaling improvements, all of which are aimed at reducing transaction costs at its core.The future development of Bitcoin Cash is seen by the developers as the implementation of three core ideas.With “Adjustable Blocksize Cap” as the faction’s name and slogan, this most popular Bitcoin Cash client also acts in the interest of node operators and intends to allow them “to adjust their block size limit.” The changes are planned to be implemented by “removing software bottlenecks.”“Liberal wing”Restoring the original Satoshi protocolLeader: Craig WrightFounded: August 2018Miners’ votes: 6 percentSupporters: CoinGeek, CalvinAyre, Bitcoin.orgThe Bitcoin ABC views are opposed by the Bitcoin SV faction. Created on August 16 by the Blockchain development firm belonging to Craig Wright, who has previously declared himself Satoshi Nakamoto, the faction actively promotes the idea of radical changing the current Bitcoin Cash structure. Its split is designed to entirely overwrite the network scripts of Bitcoin ABC and increase the block size of Bitcoin Cash from 32MB to a maximum of 128MB, all of which are expected to increase network capacity and scale.Promoting “miners choice: miners first” philosophy, Bitcoin SV intends to win miners’ votes by restoring the original Bitcoin protocol and promising long-term revenues.“Because miners should drive the roadmap in the Bitcoin space, CoinGeek and other miners asked nChain to create a professionally-driven implementation of the Bitcoin full node software (for use on BCH) that restores the original Bitcoin protocol.”“Neutral wing”Voting rights to developersLeader: Andrew CliffordFounded: July 2017Miners’ votes: 37 percentSince the proposals of above-mentioned factions are incompatible, the upcoming hard fork may result in the division of the Bitcoin Cash blockchain into two separate blockchains. To minimize risks, Andrew Stone, a leading developer of Bitcoin Unlimited, proposed a compromise solution called “Bitcoin Unlimited’s strategy for the November 2018 hard fork” on August 21.This upgrade is expected to provide an opportunity to introduce the changes to both Bitcoin ABC and Bitcoin SV, thus giving miners the opportunity to vote for the features they want to see implemented in the hard fork, according to Stone’s proposal.“There are two changesets proposed for the November 2018 hard fork that have a variety of supporters but can be summarized as coming from Bitcoin ABC and Nchain. It is ironic that these changesets are mutually compatible, yet both groups reject the other’s changes.”To execute Stone’s proposal, miners will have to switch to the Bitcoin Unlimited client, and then activate the Bitcoin ABC and Bitcoin SV features by voting (BIP 139).Though Bitcoin SV is supported by only 7 percent of the Bitcoin Cash community nodes, given the CoinDance statistics, it is promoted by Craig Wright, also known as CSW. An Australian computer scientist and entrepreneur, who had previously proclaimed himself to be Satoshi Nakamoto, from time to time was exchanging verbal battles with Jihan Wu, co-founder of the biggest crypto miner and manufacturer, Bitmain.The latter accused Wright of various things  – from being a Blockstream spy to sending him verbally to “high heaven” for his faked claims.From the very beginning I have had a conspiracy theory that CSW is a spy controlled by Blockstream.The whole BCH community are working together to kick Fake Satoshi out. The resisitence against cult leader proves the inner strength and sophistication of the BCH ecosystem!Wright is not far behind in making public accusations, most of which are related to the code of the hard forks and Bitmain’s business activity.You are about to learn how weak and in debt Jihan and Bitmain are, they will not last.Your trust in that shill, just LOL https://t.co/rsvD0rr9KwThe initial disputes on the Bitcoin’s block size limit seem to have outdone hot political debates. As the hard fork is approaching, Wright’s messages to ABC, Roger Ver, and Bitmain are turning into bankruptcy threats and accusations of being engaged in Silicon Road machinations and child pornography.Yes, we orphan him and bitmain into bankruptcyIf @jihanwu, @Rogerver & ABC devs want to make #Permissionless Kiddie porn sites and Silk Road Version2.0They can piss off to #DashThey are NOT adding this to #BCHThis is the ONLY real use case they have and it is not happening!No matter how the two individuals settle their own personal scores, the screenshot of the email where Craig Wright calls Roger Ver his “enemy,” as reported by the latter on November 8, suggests that the hard fork will likely result in a split.As such, the hard fork scheduled for November 15 may affect the entire network, which in turn may lead to a series of repercussions for the entire market. Given that Bitcoin Cash is trading above $507 as of press time and its market capitalization is $8.8 billion, according to Coinmarketcap. A continued feud between the fourth biggest cryptocurrency communities would have a significant impact on the crypto market in general. If the fork doesn’t go as planned, the effects may be felt by every major market participant from exchanges to other blockchains.Though seemingly unpopular, Bitcoin SV has its major supporters that would well tip the balance in its favor at the critical moment. CoinGeek is the largest Bitcoin mining pool to date, with a 36.8 percent share of the total Bitcoin Cash network hashrate.Image source: Coin.danceHowever, the equation may change since a major holder of Bitcoin Cash and a backer of Bitcoin ABC, Bitmain, has recently reached out to “almost all” Chinese mining farms in the coal-rich region of Xinjiang to deploy around 90,000 Antminer S9 miners, as reported by Cointelegraph on November 8. If this deployment succeeds, Bitcoin SV’s CoinGeek pool dominance may significantly reduce.As the deadline approaches, the compatibility now seen on all available nodes looks more like the breakdown of forces before a major battle, with Bitcoin ABC holding 48 percent, BIP 139 – 34 percent, and Bitcoin SV seeming doomed with 7 percent. In spite of the ideological struggle, 3 percent of public nodes are not in favor of any of the proposed splits.Image source: Coin.danceFollowing major businesses and miners in their support of one or another candidate, cryptocurrency exchanges have started to announce their positions in the Bitcoin Cash debate. Bitcoin ABC has been preliminary accepted for listing by Binance, Coinbase, and OKEx, while Poloniex announced to support both Bitcoin SV and Bitcoin ABC in case the split occurs.While “the miners are the most important thing and decide everything for BCH,” according to Twitter blogger WhalePanda, famous for his critics of the Bitcoin’s fork, members of the Bitcoin Cash community have also differed in their votes. While some believe that “helping people split their coins is the most safe option since they get keep both their BCH and BSV coins without accidental transfers,” other vote against the split, and the final results will be shown by the hashrate charts only."

Experts Weigh In",https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-volatility-hits-record-low-calm-before-a-major-short-term-rally-experts-weigh-in,"Bitcoin has started to experience a noticeable decline in its volatility 
during a period in which the volume of the dominant cryptocurrency ...","Oct 17, 2018","Disclaimer: This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.","In the beginning of October, Bitcoin achieved a 17-month low volatility rate, recording its highest level of stability since mid-2017.Bitcoin has started to experience a noticeable decline in its volatility during a period in which the volume of the dominant cryptocurrency achieved a new yearly low. Thus, the volume of Bitcoin dropped from $4.2 billion to $3.2 billion on October 7, by more than 23 percent. Since then, the volume of BTC has recovered substantially, back to $4.2 billion, but it still remains substantially lower than previous weeks. The overall decline in trading activity in the cryptocurrency exchange market due to the uncertainty in the short-term price trend of Bitcoin is said to have contributed to the significant drop in its rate of volatility.Mike McGlone, a commodity strategist, stated that as the cryptocurrency market matures, the rate of Bitcoin volatility will continue to rapidly decline. He explained that an emerging asset class often sees a large discrepancy in its daily price movements and volatility in volume until it finds strong infrastructure to support and solidify its market.""This is a maturing market, so volatility should continue to decline. When you have a new market, it will be highly volatile until it establishes itself. There are more participants, more derivatives, more ways of trading, hedging, and arbitraging.”Since August 9, the price of Bitcoin has remained relatively stable in the range between $6,400 and $6,800. Apart from one occasion in mid-September during which BTC surpassed the $7,000 mark, the asset has shown no signs of solid momentum, mostly due to the lack of volume in the cryptocurrency exchange market.On October 6, the cryptocurrency exchange market recorded its lowest daily volume in over 12 months, leading traders to be concerned regarding the short-term trend of the market.The decline in the volume and volatility of Bitcoin can have a negative impact on the short-term price trend of the asset. But historically, BTC tended to experience a dip in volume and volatility before initiating large rallies on the upside.As seen in the volatility chart of Bitcoin, dating back to 2012, provided by Woobull, a cryptocurrency market data platform operated by technical analyst Willy Woo, Bitcoin achieved one of its lowest volatility rates in October 2013.Image source: Woobull.comSubsequent to demonstrating a few months of stability, by the end of 2013, the price of BTC increased from around $30 to $1,000, by more than 30-fold within a two-month period. The stability of BTC allowed investors in the market to initiate an accumulation phase in a low price range, enabling more investors to enter the market and acquire BTC.As prominent venture capital investor Garry Tan, who invested in Coinbase and a group of startups, worth more than $20 billion collectively, said, a low price range helps investors enter a new market or an asset class with significantly less risk:“The crypto winter generally makes it safer for super-long-term oriented Yale-model institutions to enter at a price that isn’t dangerous. You know what is scary? Investing and then immediately seeing an 80% drop. That is hard to recover from.”Bitcoin is unlikely to experience a surge in its price in the magnitude of its previous rallies including the 30-fold growth it achieved in 2013. But, in the long-term, stability could allow BTC to establish legs and build stronger support levels in its low price range, increasing the probability of both short-term and mid-term rallies.Currently, the cryptocurrency market is not reacting to many of the positive developments that have emerged in the sector over the past few months.In a period of three months, NYSE, Microsoft, and Starbucks have announced the launch of regulated cryptocurrency brokerage Bakkt, to better institutionalize the cryptocurrency market. Coinbase and BitGo received the approval of regulators to operate as trusted custodians to service institutional investors. Citigroup and Goldman Sachs have announced their plans of establishing crypto-focused custodian solutions in the short-term.$30 billion brokerage giant TD Ameritrade recently backed the launch of ErisX, the first regulated multi-crypto futures market with Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin support. Seba, a cryptocurrency bank in Switzerland, is expected to obtain a banking license from the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) by the end of October.It is entirely possible, upon the recovery of Bitcoin’s volume and trading activity in the cryptocurrency exchange market, that the market will begin to respond to most of the progress that has been made in the sector over the last three months.Bitcoin has not demonstrated such a high level of stability in a long period of time. Considering that BTC has continuously demonstrated higher lows throughout the past 30 days, meaning that BTC has consistently recovered beyond its previous high point, it is more likely for BTC to eye a movement to the upside.Danny Les, cryptocurrency analyst, stated that extended periods of stability and consolidation often lead to a strong upside movement.“Any extended period of consolidation or ranging is usually the run up to a fairly strong move. That said, opinion is mixed on whether that move is up or down. When you're analyzing charts, generally higher highs and higher lows are the indicators of a positive move up. Lower highs are probably not the best thing to pin hopes to in expectation of a rally. However, this is Bitcoin so [it is unpredictable].”Many analysts and traders in the cryptocurrency sector have echoed this sentiment, stating that in hindsight, the bull run of BTC will be strikingly obvious. But, the low volume of the dominant cryptocurrency and the lack of momentum on major cryptocurrencies, still poses a concern for traders in the space. Les added:“Unless already comfortably in profit, a drop in volume is never something one wants to see when in a position. The overall sentiment attached to crypto probably isn't the most positive. Bitcoin effectively nose diving since last years all-time high has created a steady wave of retail interest decline across all crypto markets.”Billionaire investor Mike Novogratz has emphasized $6,800 as a major resistance level for Bitcoin throughout the past month, and if BTC comfortably surpasses that level, then it will be able to eye resistance levels in the $7,000 and $8,000 region.If Bitcoin breaks out of the $6,800 mark relatively quickly, Novogratz said it is possible for BTC to demonstrate a 30 percent increase in price by the end of the year.“Thirty percent – there’s some key levels. You’ve got to take out $6,800 and if that breaks, you’ll go up to $8,800, $9,000 and if that breaks, it’s $10,000. Those kind of numbers make sense to me by the end of the year. You’re not going to see the massive run until the institutions actually start buying a lot. And the architecture is being put in place now. It’s going to be announced in the next few months. But then it’ll take a little bit of time to go through investment committees and whatnot.”The issue is that since August 9, Bitcoin has consistently tried to break out of the $6,800 resistance level and failed in most of its attempts. It recovered beyond $7,000 on September 4, but it struggled to sustain its momentum and fell back down to the mid-$6,000 region.Les explained that it is more likely for Bitcoin to experience a shakeout prior to a major rally on the upside. BTC has to experience a promising increase in its volume and price to ensure that 2019 begins with a positive sentiment:“I suspect that there will be more blood before any kind of serious rally up. Volume and price, certainly in Bitcoin's case need to pick up before we get to near Christmas, otherwise we will see the year out with a very negative sentiment attached.”In late August, when the price of BTC was still at around $6,600, ShapeShift CEO Erik Voorhees stated that the bear market is not over yet but it is a viable period for new investors in the space to start accumulating Bitcoin.Voorhees stated the rate of collapse of the crypto market has slowed down considerably and it is highly unlikely for BTC to decline far below its current price range.BTC has dipped below the $6,000 mark on three occasions throughout the past nine months. BTC recovered relatively quickly from the $5,900 region, leaving a short window for investors to acquire the dominant cryptocurrency at a price below the $6,000 level.Image source: Cryptowat.chGiven the strong support level of Bitcoin at $6,000 and many of the positive developments the sector has seen, Voorhees stated that it is an appropriate time to start accumulating BTC.According to Les many platforms and companies in the cryptocurrency sector are continuously working on building the infrastructure that is necessary to support the next wave of users, investors, and consumers:“Many platforms are ignoring talk of token prices and are just quietly working in the background to fulfil their roadmap objectives. In 2019, I think will be a very interesting year for us all. Mainstream adoption of the technology will start to become apparent and investment methods into the market will become much more in line with traditional markets. The future is very bright, however there has to be a bit of darkness beforehand.”TD Ameritrade, the fifth largest brokerage in the US, stated that it sees sufficient demand from investors in both the crypto and financial sector to be comfortable with its investment in the cryptocurrency sector.Technical indicators, such as Williams’ Percent Range of Bitcoin, show that it is more bear-biased as of October 2018. However, as Don Alt, a cryptocurrency trader supposed, bulls have leverage over the bears which are currently dealing with a market with low volume and activity.The next big move will be so incredibly obvious in hindsight.Bulls have:1) BAKKT coming2) Increased legislative & institutional interest3) Lows holding strongBears have:I) Weakening 6k supportII) Sell off stronger than rallysIII) Missing final shakeoutThe market has also demonstrated intense seller fatigue throughout September and October, making it unlikely for a large downside movement to occur in the weeks to come. It is possible for BTC to be stagnant in a low price range but the probability of the dominant cryptocurrency dipping below the $6,000 support level is low.Thus, a final shakeout could be in play prior to a major mid-term rally. Generally, most analysts agree that the low rate of volatility Bitcoin has shown throughout the past three months, and particularly in October, will help fuel the next mid-term rally of BTC."

Bitcoin's carbon footprint and its potential future impact on global ...","Oct 29, 2018","A new report from climate change scientists has raised the alarm over Bitcoin (BTC)’s carbon footprint and its potential future impact on global warming, published on Nature.com Oct. 29.","The report extrapolates existing data for Bitcoin’s electricity consumption together with various projections for the cryptocurrency’s adoption in coming years.According to the report, in 2017, out of a rough total of 314.2 billion cashless transactions, Bitcoin’s share is estimated to have been around 0.033 percent. While acknowledging that “accelerated growth” is common at the early adoption stage of new technologies, the report nonetheless claims that even if Bitcoin follows a lower-level “median growth trend,” it could come to equal the global total of cashless transactions “in under 100 years.”Should this materialize, cumulative emissions of Bitcoin usage would “cross the 2 C threshold within 22 years” if its adoption rate is similar to some of “the slowest broadly adopted technologies,” or within just “11 years” if adopted at the fastest rate of adoption. The carbon footprint forecast assumes that the fuel types used to generate power today will remain “relatively fixed” in future years.For Bitcoin’s current carbon footprint, the report references recent research from Digiconomist calculated “on the assumptions” that:“60 percent of the economic return of the Bitcoin transaction verification process goes to electricity, at $0.05 per kWh and 0.7 kg of carbon dioxide-equivalent (CO2e) emitted per kWh, [resulting in an] estimate that Bitcoin usage emits 33.5 metric tons of CO2e annually, as of May 2018.”While refraining from predicting Bitcoin’s “fate,” the scientists suggest that economic logic will prompt miners to migrate to areas with low cost power supplies, therefore proposing that “electricity decarbonization could help to mitigate Bitcoin’s carbon footprint — but only where the cost of electricity from renewable sources is cheaper than fossil fuels.”Should energy costs remain high, more efficient hardware may help reduce its footprint, the report concedes, yet advises against relying on “yet-to-be-developed hardware.” It instead proposes “simple modifications to the overall system, such as adding more transactions per block or reducing the difficulty or time required to resolve the proof-of-work” in order to “immediately” reduce Bitcoin’s electricity consumption.  Not all energy experts concur with the common perception that high energy consumption is an “Achilles Heel” for Bitcoin. A report published in August critiqued the exclusive focus on mining’s energy-intensivity, emphasizing the importance of where the energy is produced and how it is generated, arguing that “electricity production can increase while still maintaining a minimal impact on the environment.”"

An open-source protocol is enabling users to transfer value from ...","Oct 24, 2018",A new protocol is allowing users to complete cross-chain transactions – meaning value can be transferred between different blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.,"The open-source technology is known as the Open Federated Gateway Protocol, or OFGP for short. It has been developed by iBitcome and DEx.top, and the first federated blockchain to be built using this protocol is launching on Wednesday, Oct. 24. Known as Mallow, it is accompanied by a block explorer which enables users to examine the flow of assets and check up on transactions whenever they please.According to iBitcome, trading between Bitcoin and Ethereum is going to be supported through the creation of a new token known as WBCH. The value of this cryptocurrency is pegged to the price of 1 Bitcoin Cash. It is hoped that support for other public blockchains is going to follow in the not-too-distant future.Emphasizing its open source nature, iBitcome says anyone is free to build their own gateway using the OFGP. Over time, it is hoped that other federations like Mallow will start to be developed – creating healthy competition in the marketplace, giving crypto enthusiasts choice and minimizing the importance of centralization.iBitcome has already launched a crypto wallet, which is available to download on iOS and Android, and the company says it is “committed to providing secure and convenient payment services.” The startup says its multi-crypto wallet supports the likes of Tether along with Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Ethereum – adding that users benefit from an “AES-128-CTR encryption algorithm” and a decentralized infrastructure where they do not have to store their private key.The company hopes that Mallow’s launch is going to enable existing iBitcome users to complete transfers of assets more efficiently between main chains and side chains. OFGP utilizes the Byzantine Fault Tolerant Raft (or Braft for short) in order to achieve consistently fast transaction speeds. In time, it is hoped that asset collateral certification on the public blockchain will pave the way for supporting “more complex applications and faster payments.”iBitcome says that tackling the issue of scalability and interaction between public chains is one of its main priorities, as well as striving to maintain decentralization for its user base.According to iBitcome, its collaboration with the DEx.top, a decentralized exchange, provides “security and transparency” because transactions are settled on the blockchain. The partnership also paves the way for trading on the move and through smartphones, as the exchange can be accessed directly from the crypto wallet. The startup’s website adds that instant transactions are possible thanks to a mechanism known as ROC – which is short for Replayed On Chain.Users can also access DApps through the iBitcome crypto wallet – and benefit from a digital ID system which enables them to prevent fraud and maintain “full control over their identity.”As its gateway protocol is introduced to the public, iBitcome hopes to establish connections between public blockchains which may have suffered from isolation otherwise. Disclaimer.

But on the store-of-value side it’s unquestionably a success.""  Bloomberg cites a recent study from blockchain intelligence firm Chainalysis that suggests Bitcoin’s use as private money in commerce is indeed on the decline, even as its popularity as an asset – as digital “gold” – has had significant traction among investors.Unfazed by the twists and turns of the project’s evolution, Garzik stated, “Bitcoin is an organism, it’s something that evolves.” He then adopted a solicitous tone, remarking that, “as a father I enjoy watching my kids grow up, even as they make mistakes or grow in ways that I wouldn’t expect.""As Bloomberg outlines, Garzik began writing software code for Bitcoin as early as July 2010, after reading a blog post about the as yet incipient project. The article portrays the crypto trailblazer at the time as “working remotely for open-source powerhouse Red Hat Inc. from an RV parked in an empty lot in Raleigh, North Carolina.”In Bitcoin’s infancy, Garzik, now 44, reportedly corresponded privately with Nakamoto via email and the Bitcointalk forum, ahead of the Nakamoto’s much-mythologized, abrupt disappearance in 2011.Commenting on various hypotheses as to the creator’s identity, Garzik said:""My personal theory is that it’s [Satoshi Nakamoto] Floridian Dave Kleiman. It matches his coding style, this gentleman was self taught. And the Bitcoin coder was someone who was very, very smart, but not a classically trained software engineer.”According to Bloomberg Garzik has over the course of his activities given away Bitcoin valued at over $100 million (15,678 BTC) at today’s market prices. He declined to disclose his current holdings.Garzik continued coding for the Bitcoin project until 2016, and now sits on the boards of crypto payments processor Bitpay, mining tech firm Bitfury, and the Linux Foundation.

The QR code contains the minimal amount of information necessary to sign a transaction [...] The people performing the signing ceremony interact with servers. The servers are located in undisclosed secure locations.”The company also says it has leveraged industry stalwart crypto wallet Trezor’s “open source projects (such as trezor-crypto) as much as possible.”As reported yesterday, Oct. 22, Dutch multinational banking and financial services corporation ING has also recently released the open source code for its blockchain privacy improvement mechanism dubbed “Zero-Knowledge Set Membership (ZKSM),” which aims to provide validation of specific data without compromising that data’s overall security."

Transferred as Property",https://cointelegraph.com/news/chinese-arbitrator-reaffirms-that-bitcoin-can-be-held-privately-transferred-as-property,"A Chinese arbitration court has ruled that “there is no law or regulation 
that explicitly prohibits parties from holding bitcoin or private ...","Oct 26, 2018","An arbitration body in China has ruled that cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) are legally protected as property, in a case published Oct. 25 via the arbitrator’s WeChat account.","The Shenzhen Court of International Arbitration ruled in favor of an unnamed plaintiff in an equity transfer dispute, in which the defendant failed to return holdings of Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Bitcoin Diamond (BCD) as had been agreed upon in a contractual agreement.According to the case outline, the contract had authorized the defendant to trade and manage the plaintiff’s portfolio of 20.13 BTC, 50 BCH, and 12.66 BCD for a stipulated time. When the defendant failed to return the holdings as per the agreed schedule, the plaintiff brought the case before the arbitrator, seeking the return of his assets with interest.The defense had attempted to argue that the contractual equity transfer agreement was invalid, pointing to the fact that cryptocurrencies are not recognized as legal tender in China, and that their circulation is subject to severe restrictions in the country.The defendant cited the central bank’s Announcement on Preventing Financial Risks from Initial Coin Offerings (ICO), which was passed in Sept. 2017, stating that ICOs that raise “so-called virtual currencies” such as BTC and Ethereum (ETH) “through the irregular sale and circulation of tokens” are engaging in “unauthorized” public financing, which is “illegal.”The central bank had also determined that crypto “cannot and should not be circulated nor used in the market as currency.”The defendant claimed that the core “payment and arrangement of the transfer price” clause of the contract was thus in violation of the mandatory provisions of Chinese law, which prohibits the sale and circulation of crypto tokens, as well as the trading platforms used as a venue for their transfer and exchange.The arbitrator however found that the contractual obligation under dispute did not fall under the relevant provisions as outlined in the Sept. 2017 prohibition, stating that:“There is no law or regulation that explicitly prohibits parties from holding bitcoin or private transactions in bitcoin, [only warnings to] the public about the investment risks. The contract in this case stipulates the obligation to return the bitcoin between two natural persons, and does not belong to the [Sept. 2017 ban].”The arbitrator thus concluded that the contract was legally binding, adding that:""Bitcoin has the nature of a property, which can be owned and controlled by parties, and is able to provide economic values and benefits.""The arbitrator refuted that restrictions on exchanges pose an obstacle, noting that private crypto transfers face no technical difficulties as long as both parties have a unique wallet address.The ruling thus ordered the defendant to uphold his contractual obligations and return the assets under dispute with interest (calculated by the arbitrator as being worth $493,158.40), as well as to pay a penalty of 100,000 yuan ($14,400).  This June, a Shanghai court similarly ruled in favor of an ICO operator in the context of an unjust enrichment civil dispute case. Similarly denying the applicability of the Sept. 2017 ban, the court deemed that Ethereum (ETH) is protected under China’s property law, as long as the plaintiff can provide proof a digital chain of custody to the court.This September, China’s Supreme Court ruled that evidence authenticated with blockchain technology is binding in legal disputes."

The latter has not been arrested, as per media reports.Indian business magazine Business Today (BT) cites a press statement from the Central Crime Branch (CCB), which claims the ATM installation did not receive “any permission from the state government and is dealing in cryptocurrency outside the remit of the law.""CCB officials are further reported to have seized “a teller machine, two laptops, a mobile, three credit cards, five debit cards, a passport, five seals of Unocoin company, a cryptocurrency device and Rs 1.8 lakh ($2,460).”As corroborated by multiple local Indian media sources, the ATM had not in fact yet been operational ahead of the police action, with Unocoin tweeting Oct. 20 that:“Our Machine didn't go well with few mainstream media reports who projected it under a negative light. The machine is still under final testing mode and it will be up and running in the upcoming week. The machine has been temporarily moved from its original place of installation.”Harish BV was reportedly presented before an ACMM (Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate) court, which sent him to police custody for seven days. Police are said to have stated that “more arrests are likely,” and to have appealed to the public “not to be lured by the prospect of making huge profits” through crypto.The Times of India reports the machine was used to facilitate cryptocurrency deals, with Indian digital newspaper The News Minute (TNM) outlining that it had been set up in response to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)’s stringent ban on financial institutions dealing in cryptocurrencies.TNM further cites Unocoin as saying that it had attempted to establish “newer mechanisms and solutions to reduce the [...] [regulatory] hurdles [caused] by the present central government’s stan[ce].” Users of the machine could reportedly withdraw and deposit Bitcoin, but not buy or sell the cryptocurrency.Referring to Minister of Finance Arun Jaitley’s 2018-19 budget speech, Unicoin’s Viswanath is quoted by the Times of India as saying that:“The minister’s statement was clear: Cryptocurrencies are not legal tender in India. He did not say ‘illegal tender.’ There’s a huge difference. It means you bear the risk of your investment and there’s no regulation for the industry.”As previously reported, Unocoin this summer announced it had suspended fiat deposits and withdrawals “as per orders” from the RBI. Crypto asset deposits nonetheless continue to be active on both Unocoin’s crypto-rupee trading platform and partner crypto-crypto exchange Unodax."

Online peer-to-peer exchanges may look questionable or too complicated for some users. Purchasing altcoins may be even more complicated - in order to buy many of them, users have to purchase major cryptocurrencies first.","Netcoins Inc. is one of the companies that aims to offer a solution for those who prefer to buy Bitcoin and altcoins from a trusted source, rather than online. The team is creating a new opportunity for altcoins to get into the physical retail marketplace, allowing users to buy crypto instantly for fiat with cash, debit, or credit card.Netcoins, a company based in Vancouver, BC, Canada, has a global retail network of 170,000 locations in 53 countries across six continents, where people can easily walk into a store to buy Bitcoin and altcoins with fiat.The company says, these 170,000 stores open up the purchase of coins to the average person right in their own neighborhood, without the potential headaches of signing on with an exchange.Most of the stores sell vouchers which can then be redeemed online, on the Netcoins website, for crypto. In some locations, Netcoins operates its own virtual crypto ATM software that allows retailers to sell a wide variety of cryptocurrencies. “We turn any device like a tablet or laptop into a virtual crypto ATM, so that consumers can buy crypto easily in a familiar retail setting,” the company says.Any retailer that has a checkout can host Netcoins’ virtual crypto ATM software. It can be a supermarket, an electronic or beauty store – virtually anywhere where customers make purchases. The only thing required by the customer is an email address and a small convenience fee, which the retailer shares with Netcoins.“The customers don’t need to understand anything more about cryptocurrency,” said Mark Binns, Netcoins’ CEO and director. Customers don’t even necessarily need to have a digital wallet. The software can create a blockchain wallet for them automatically. Netcoins’ software engine also provides real-time quoting, exchange options, instant ordering, and automated invoicing. The app can run on a browser from any internet-connected device.Netcoins has been working in the cryptocurrency market for four years. The company believes that its platform can make cryptocurrencies more popular for the 95 percent of the population that is still not familiar with the crypto market.The team also hopes their solution will help altcoins overcome the issues they currently have. Though the usage of altcoins is growing, Bitcoin and Ethereum are still the dominant cryptocurrencies for transactions.Besides the problems with mass adoption, it may also be very expensive for altcoins to get listed on many traditional exchanges. Netcoins recently ran a special coin listing contest where users could nominate and vote for their favorite altcoin. 83 coins were nominated and the cryptocurrency Steem took home the top prize. They will get a free listing worth $30,000 on Netcoins’ platform. In just the last few months, Netcoins has increased the number of coins available on its platform from 2 to 17.The Netcoins team believes in the potential of altcoins. “We allow altcoins to gain exposure in a retail environment and make it available for the average consumer, saving the need for a traditional exchange account” —  the company says. In 2018, Netcoins listed 13 paid altcoins on its LAAS (Listing As A Service) business model for coin listings. "

Under the new consensus rules, 41 blocks have been already mined, wherein Bitcoin ABC is 12 blocks ahead.The update has led cryptocurrency exchanges around the world to suspend BCH trading and withdrawals.The news about the protocol upgrade has divided the BCH community in two camps as there are two dominating proposals for the implementation of the BCH network in the form of Bitcoin ABC and Bitcoin SV (Satoshi’s Vision).Bitcoin ABC stands for “Adjustable Blocksize Cap”, and its proponents argue that the basic structure of BCH is “sound,” and “does not need any radical change”. Proposed changes include “removing software bottlenecks” and enabling node operators to change their block size limit.Bitcoin ABC is supported by crypto evangelist Roger Ver, while Bitcoin SV supporters are led by Craig Wright, who has previously declared himself to be the mysterious Bitcoin inventor Satoshi Nakamoto. The SV camp promotes radically changing the current BCH structure, where its split is designed to entirely overwrite the network scripts of Bitcoin ABC and increase the BCH block size from 32MB to a maximum of 128MB.The issue of a BCH upgrade caused a heated dispute in the community; Wright engaged in verbal battles with Bitmain’s co-founder Jihan Wu, who accused Wright of being a Blockstream spy. Wright’s messages to ABC, Roger Ver, and Bitmain have turned into bankruptcy threats and accusations of being engaged in Silicon Road machinations and child pornography.A continued feud between the crypto communities would have a significant impact on the crypto market in general, while a split caused by a hard fork will affect the entire network."

Jaravijit was reportedly in the process of handling his return with the Thai embassy in the U.S.On Tuesday, the Thai Anti-Money Laundering Office (AMLO) confiscated funds worth $6.4 million from Jaravijit's family and other people connected to the case.

You just need to interact with the smart contract by using any Ethereum wallet like MyEtherWallet.com or geth. The token incorporates a similar mining mechanism to Bitcoin, including the mining reward halving every 4 years. The whole process is quite transparent and we invite anyone interested to review the Bitcoinereum source code.” the Bitcoinereum team told Cointelegraph.The token website states only 21,000,000 coins can be mined and the initial supply was zero coins, as there was no pre-mine. According to the team, it should take around 132 years to mine every Bitcoinereum.The developers put the limit to a maximum of 50 coins being mined every 10 minutes, the same mining reward as Bitcoin back in 2009. This reward will continue until 2021 when it will be halved to 25, the team says. However, Bitcoinereum mechanism allows not only one miner to receive the full reward every 10 minutes. The reward is split by 50 calls instead, and whoever makes the first 50 calls receives the coins during that period. These rules are designed to help avoid a mining monopoly and get a better distribution of Bitcoinereum across the community. At press time 320,000 coins were mined so far.The concept of smart contract mining (or public mining) means allowing anyone to mine a token by calling a smart contract function, the team explained. This concept was originally introduced by Artemine, a token which also does not require any customary equipment for mining. It was announced as an updated version of Minereum. At the time of its launch in 2017, Artemine’s team managed to build a major platform that was focused on public mining and self-mining principles.Artemine coin can be mined in two ways, by calling a smart contract function or by owning a Genesis Address. Another major update which was introduced is the possibility of decentralized trading of Genesis Addresses, “making them a sort of crypto collectable,” the team explained. The self-ming process of Genesis Addresses is automated and based on a mathematical formula. In addition to this, users can transfer their Genesis Addresses and trade them on the open market, directly to the purchaser without any third party involvement. Sales can be made through smart contracts in a peer-to-peer environment. The project’s team expects all Artemine Genesis Addresses to be mined in the next 40 to 60 years.Disclaimer.

Hut 8 attributed the increase to its deployment of 16 Bitfury BlockBoxes in September at its mining facility in the City of Medicine Hat, for an aggregate of 56 BlockBoxes at that site. Each BlockBox contains 176 mining servers and reportedly has a hashrate of 13.7 Pethashes per second (Ph/s).In Q3, Hut 8’s cost for mining a single Bitcoin was $3,394, which is lower than the current market price of around $6,400, which is reflected in the report as the company’s mining profit for Q3 was $6.6 million, with a mining profit margin of 51 percent. Hut 8 claims that this makes it one of the lowest-cost BTC mining companies globally.Hut 8’s mining profit margin and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) was lower during Q3 for a few reasons. The BTC price significantly appreciated through the quarter, while competition from other BTC miners increased. Another factor was the record high temperatures in Alberta, which resulted in increased electricity costs at Hut 8’s Drumheller facility.The company expects that the efficiency of Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) chips used to mine cryptocurrencies will rise during the colder months, which subsequently will improve performance in the next quarter.Hut 8 launched its Medicine Hat facility in July in partnership with BTC mining equipment manufacturer BitFury. At that time, Hut 8 had mined around 1,000 BTC since its launch in December of last year.Meanwhile, BTCC Pool, the mining operation of Hong Kong-based cryptocurrency exchange BTCC, announced it will close “indefinitely” at the end of November due to unknown “business adjustments.” BTCC nonetheless expressed a sense of optimism, hinting that the decision to close down was not strictly permanent."

Described by Kashif Raza, of the local blockchain advisory duo “Crypto Kanoon,” as being among India’s “brightest” tech pioneers, and an “icon of the crypto industry.”Their high-profile arrest and remand in police custody for seven days thus carries undeniable symbolic clout, perceived as being tantamount to putting innovation itself behind bars.Cointelegraph spoke with Kashif Raza to unravel the story, as well as consulting with local cyber expert lawyer, Prashant Mali, whose periodic interjections, “yeh kahan se aa gaya?” (“where did this come from?”), encapsulate the local crypto community sentiment in the wake of the arrests.Bangalore, which earned the sobriquet of India’s “Silicon Valley” for its buzz of tech startups and venture capital firms, is perhaps unsurprisingly the home turf of the country’s “first entrant into the Bitcoin industry,” Unocoin, founded in the city in 2013.Four years after its inception, the startup says it now employs 120 full-timers to run its BTC-INR (rupee) trading platform, to process transactions worth over 2 billion INR monthly, for over 1.3 million users.Recent years were propitious for initiatives like Unocoin, which began to attract significant venture capital investment in fall 2016, just as Indians’ interest in Bitcoin was hitting a fever pitch as the government ushered in its bold — and still highly contentious — demonetization policy.In a bid to clamp down on tax evasion, in November 2016, the Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, announced the invalidation of 500 and 1,000 rupee bills — which accounted for 86 percent of the currency in circulation at the time. Demand for crypto in the heat of the “cashless chaos” of that year soared, catapulting Bitcoin’s valuation to a 12 percent premium on the Unocoin exchange.Unocoin president, Sunny Ray, revealed that Bitcoin trading doubled in the midst of a tumultuous, demonetized economic climate that was yet further stoked by that winter’s rumors of impending curbs on domestic gold holdings and possible restrictions on gold imports.Trading euphoria showed little signs of letting up the following year, with popular Indian exchanges, such as Zebpay, forced to cap Bitcoin purchases in spring 2017 as their supplies failed to keep pace: the Zebpay Bitcoin Wallet India hit over half a million downloads in May, eclipsing many of the country’s stalwart banking incumbents on the Apple app store.By mid-June, data showed India accounting for 10 percent of the preceding month’s global USD/BTC trade volumes.Yet 2017 also presaged an unfolding, increasingly crypto-skeptic agenda on the part of India’s government and monetary authorities. In February, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) — steward of the country’s notoriously strict capital controls — chose to reiterate its 2013 warning against the dangers of investing or trading in virtual currencies, yet nothing in the statement as of yet went beyond striking an official note of circumspection.Then, in March, a member of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Kirit Somaiya, characterized Bitcoin as a risk-ridden “hypothetical currency” before parliament, urging RBI, the Securities and Exchange Board (SEBI), and the Finance Ministry, to step in as a matter of “urgent need” to rescue the populace from yet “another big Ponzi fraud.”Somayia soon tipped over from alarmism to outright fallacy, when he falsely claimed that crypto was “illegal” in ensuing weeks, dismissing the robust self-regulatory initiatives of the country’s thriving exchanges as “nonsense.” And he wasn’t the only minister to do so.Yet even as politicians whistled the tune of illegality, ASSOCHAM, one of the country’s most veteran trading bodies, devoted a global summit to the topic of Bitcoin’s status in India that April.  An Inter-Disciplinary Committee within the Finance Ministry was formed to proactively investigate the legal status of Bitcoin, and in May, the government appealed to the public to provide input as it evaluated the possibility of regulating the market.Positive glimmers on the crypto regulatory front surfaced that summer, yet soon lapsed into inconclusive inertia, and from there, to an increasingly bleak prognosis. An as-yet-undisclosed draft of proposed regulations was rumored to lean towards a more stringent stance, just as the failures of Modi’s botched demonetization were widely becoming incontrovertibly apparent.With crypto’s future in the country in limbo, Unocoin nonetheless sealed a partnership with major wallet provider, Blockchain, in September 2017: the bullish news was paired with signs that RBI was mulling the issuance of its own digital rupee-backed coin, while continuing to voice its unease with regard to decentralized, so-called “private” cryptocurrencies.In October, tight-lipped officials were still refusing to comment on the authorities’ evolving crypto regulatory plans, yet the following month, word of a Chinese-style exchange ban was leaked to India’s mainstream media.Even with seemingly implacable negativity continuing to spill out from central bank officials that November, some were accusing the government and regulators of inexplicable dithering on the crypto front; landing the matter in the country’s highest judiciary, the Supreme Court.Yet the inauspicious backstage drama and regulatory purgatory did little to dampen Indian investors’ enthusiasm in the winter 2017 crypto bull run, with exchanges reporting “unprecedented” droves of as many as 400,000 new traders per month entering the market.On the cusp of the new year, the Finance Ministry steeled itself for an antagonistic stance, condemning cryptocurrencies as Ponzi-like threats to investors’ hard-earned money. The tone would turn out to be the dominant chord for the rest of 2018, with RBI issuing its now-notorious circular April 6, directing all domestic banks to extract themselves from existing relationships with crypto exchanges and traders “within three months.”The central bank’s controversial blockade came into force this July, and has prompted both public and industry-led petitions, with some appealing to the courts on the grounds that the decision is unconstitutional.As the final verdict on the RBI prohibition continues to be repeatedly stayed by the Supreme Court, the judiciary has now thrown the ball back in the executive’s court, setting a deadline for the government to clarify and finally cement its official position on crypto by mid-November.While April 6 is thus well-known as a red-letter day for crypto in India, the extraordinary welter of half-truths that have circulated in response to the country’s first Bitcoin “ATM” can in fact be traced back to February, to the immediate aftermath of finance minister Arun Jaitley’s 2018 budget speech.On Feb. 1, the minister addressed parliament, stating that:“The government does not recognize cryptocurrency as legal tender or coin and will take all measures to eliminate the use of these crypto assets in financing illegitimate activities or as part of the payments system.”The mainstream press responded at the time by declaring the “end of the road,” for crypto in the country: Quartz India cited a local lawyer who said he expected “a legislative mechanism […] to ensure that dealing and trading in cryptocurrency is made illegal and to penalize entities and individuals who are involved in their trade and circulation.”The social media echo chamber only compounded the flurry of misunderstandings:Bitcoin to be banned. Crypto currency illegal in India says @arunjaitley#Bitcoin #DigitalCurrency #budget2018Unocoin presciently took pains to clarify a panic-stricken public, as the price of Bitcoin plummeted from $10,300 on Jan. 31, to around $9,500 on Feb. 1:Based on the #UnionBudget2018 announcement, there is no change in government's stance with respect to #cryptocurrency. It is business-as-usual at @Unocoin #Budget2018 pic.twitter.com/YGUFOlfhCjUnocoin’s claims of “business-as-usual” may, with the benefit of hindsight, appear overly optimistic.Yet at the time, all the founders of India’s crypto exchange triumvirate — Unocoin, Zebpay, and Coinsecure — were attempting to calm investors and to underscore that “not being legal tender” did not warrant the FUD-like furore that had erupted. It was, rather, an alegal classification, which applied equally to traditional stores of value such as gold.In the ensuing weeks, a fresh spate of alarmist reports from the likes of the Financial Times and Quartz again stoked investors’ anxiety by falsely reporting on the government’s redoubled and “aggressive” pursuit of crypto tax “evaders.” The action at hand was in truth simply a “going through the motions” of a pre-agreed plan that had been announced the previous year.Fact and fiction continued their song and dance throughout winter 2018, with the latter more often than not appearing to shape the course of events.Citibank India banned the use of credit cards to purchase crypto on Feb. 14, with HDFC applying the same restriction on both debit and credit card clients in March. That month, two smaller Indian exchanges, BTCXIndia and ETHEXIndia, announced they would be stopping trading activities, blaming the “stress” caused to their businesses by the government’s negative stance.In its correspondence with clients, BTCXIndia itself compounded the already loose extrapolations of Jaitley’s words, writing that “as we heard in the budget speech, the Indian government is discouraging cryptocurrency trading” — without including the caveat that the minister had highlighted crypto’s potential financing for criminal activities as its chief concern.The former Secretary of Economic Affairs again fanned the flames of FUD in a media interview March 12, stating that crypto — which is “created out of a vacuum” — should be banned outright since it is impossible “to regulate it effectively.”In a country that had suffered the devastating shocks of 2016’s demonetization, the verdict of Bitcoin “not being legal tender” had thus taken on a particular charge, even ahead of RBI’s April action.In July, with the RBI prohibition now in full force, the country’s exchanges adopted various strategies: Zebpay preempted the official July 6 deadline by freezing rupee deposits and withdrawals July 4. That same day WazirX revealed it would transform into a peer-to-peer (p2p) platform so as to avoid in-house crypto-fiat conversion. On July 23, Unocoin itself suspended fiat deposits, until “an alternative method of funding [would be] identified and deployed.”Activities that did not depend on banks’ provisions nonetheless continued on Uncoin: crypto asset deposits were active on its crypto-rupee trading platform as well as its partner crypto-crypto exchange Unodax.At the end of September, Unocoin’s peer Zebpay, announced it would be shuttering its operations, giving customers just several hours’ notice ahead of the decision coming into effect. The platform cited the “extremely difficult” recent past, saying that RBI’s “curb on bank accounts has crippled our, and our customer’s, ability to transact business meaningfully.”Unocoin, meanwhile, as Kashif Raza stressed, was “unusual,” and set to work on an “ATM” machine that would circumvent banking channels altogether, but still allow users to deposit and withdraw fiat currencies.On Oct. 9 Crypto Kanoon was given the go-ahead to pre-empt Unocoin’s official announcement, posting a photograph of the new machine to its Twitter handle, with palpable excitement:Is this the next big thing in Indian crypto space ? @Unocoin you have earned respect from the crypto community for taking this bold step at a time when nothing is clear ahead of you.#Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/ZqmHUuRrs9The Unocoin “ATM,” installed at the Old Kemp Mall in Bangalore, was officially unveiled on Oct. 14. It was subject to customary cash handling restrictions, thus limiting the sums of daily withdrawals and deposits, and did not accept debit or credit cards in order to avoid any interaction with the banking system.A KYC-verified Unocoin customer could enter their user ID and a one-time password delivered via text message, and deposit INR into the machine: the funds would be instantly reflected in their Unocoin account balance, and could be used to buy BTC or ETH, or to place BID orders on 30 different Unodax-supported cryptos.Withdrawals followed a similar protocol that relied on SMS verification, and would need to be initiated on Unocoin’s online platform before the user could access cash at the machine.1st video tutorial on how to Deposit/ Withdraw Rupees (INR) with @Unocoin's Crypto ATM.#cryptoatmindia pic.twitter.com/xA2M0oFH64In the days after the machine’s unveiling, Twitter was as ever a good litmus test of an excited public’s response.On Oct. 18, CEO Sathvik Vishwanath confidently told the Deccan Herald that two more “ATMs” were planned for Mumbai and Delhi, with reports of ambitious plans for a total of thirty in the future. Speaking with the Times of India, he clarified:“The finance minister’s statement was very clear. He said, cryptocurrencies are not legal tender in India. He did not say illegal tender. There’s a huge difference. It only means you bear the risk of your investment and there’s no regulation for the industry.”Vishwanath’s point was reinforced by cyber lawyer, Prashant Mali, who affirmed in correspondence with Cointelegraph that India has “neither a law nor regulation directly banning ownership of cryptocurrency.”While the official press release forthrightly dubbed the new machine an “ATM,” two of Unocoin’s tweets, dated Oct. 15 and Oct. 16, struck a note of ambiguity, oscillating as they did between calling the machine first an “ATM,” and then switching to the more neutral “kiosk.”By Oct. 20, the Times of India was similarly noting that Unocoin, as distinct from its official press release on Oct. 14, now “prefers” to call the machine a “kiosk.”Loose media reporting exacerbated the confusion: below is a screenshot of a Business Standard article calling the machine both an ATM and a kiosk, and — equally misleadingly — summarizing the machine’s functions as enabling the “buying and selling” of crypto.One local crypto journalist reported on his father’s bemused response after reading an unnamed  “Gujarati newspaper,” puzzling aloud: “How are they selling Bitcoins on an ATM?”Screenshot of Business Standard’s Oct. 19 article on the Unocoin machineBy Oct. 20, Unocoin had tweeted:Our Machine didn't go well with few mainstream media reports who projected it under a negative light. The machine is still under final testing mode and it will be up and running in the upcoming week. The machine has been temporarily moved from its original place of installation.The name choice was to transpire as having been crucial: virtually all ATMs in India are governed by RBI, and the central bank outlines specific provisions for any non-banking entity wishing to operate a so-called “White Label” machine, requiring their authorization ahead of installation.Coupled with the imprecise local mainstream press reporting, Unocoin’s choice to advertise its invention as an ATM was in retrospect a significant misstep: as Crypto Kanoon has argued, the tool was after all highly limited in its function:“We ask whether any approval is required for assigning the job of a cashier to an automated machine for deposit/payment of cash to my customers?”On Oct. 22, unconfirmed rumors were surfacing on social media that:Rumours coming in from Bangalore. Unocoin exchange's INR Kiosk being examined by the Cyber Crime.No comments from Unocoin yet. pic.twitter.com/zUO58tKU1VBy Oct. 24, news had broken of the arrest of Unocoin’s co-founder and chief compliance officer (CCO), Harish BV., As corroborated by multiple local sources, the ATM had not yet been operational ahead of the police action: Harish was nonetheless briskly whisked before an ACMM (Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate) court, which sent him to police custody for seven days.A press statement from the police Central Crime Branch (CCB), asserted the ATM installation had not received “any permission from the state government and is dealing in cryptocurrency outside the remit of the law."" Mainstream press accented the police’s claims as to the alleged “illegality” of the machine, with the Times of India further reporting that:“According to police, the kiosk was a platform for Bitcoin buyers and sellers. Police requested the public not to be lured by the prospect of making huge profits and invest money in cryptocurrencies.”CCB officials were said to have seized the “ATM” itself, “two laptops, a mobile, three credit cards, five debit cards, a passport, five seals of Unocoin company, a cryptocurrency device and Rs 1.8 lakh ($2,460).”The sleuths nabbed CEO Vishwanath the following day, with the Times report this time citing Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP) S Girish’s comments that RBI had allegedly “stated that cryptocurrencies are illegal.”Notably, in the case of both arrests, the police had chosen to act “suo moto” (of their own accord), despite the ATM not even being functional as of yet.As noted, while the FIR has not been been formally released, the Times of India has claimed that the police booked the case under Section 66 of the IT Act (ITA) (computer-related offences), Section 120b (criminal conspiracy), 420 (cheating), 465 (forgery), 474 (possession of forged documents), and 471 (fraudulently using forged documents) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).Prashant Mali has confirmed that “when public order is to be maintained or if the police suspects a cognisable offence is about to be committed then they are able to take suo moto action as per Indian law.” He nonetheless reflected on the seemingly disproportionate measures:“Since all the relevant sections of the chargesheet carry punishment of below 7 years, police as per the law should have sent notice for investigation, summoned the accused owners of the ATM, and in the event of their failing to appear at police station, then they could have have arrested them. The arrest of the Unocoin directors is just sensationalism on the part of the media and senior police officers.”Commenting on the charge sheet, Mali exclaimed in response to section 420 that “no one has been cheated as yet! Nor defrauded. The kiosk was yet to start functioning.” With regard to “forgery” (465), “yeh kahan se aaya!”Moreover, he suggested, if charges of criminal conspiracy (120b) are indeed pressed, then, given that Unocoin had sealed funding from multiple venture capital (VC) firms, the VCs themselves could potentially face arrest for allegedly “financing a criminal act.”The advocate concurred with Kashif Raza’s view that “the word “ATM” created a problem for Unocoin,” and was misleading, given that visas and other payment cards were not accepted.Mali added that “if “kiosk” had been written, then the applicability of RBI’s regulation for White Label ATMs would have fallen into a grey area of the law. If however, money deposited in the kiosks was not accounted for, or was intended to be sent abroad, then indeed, other prevailing laws would have been engaged.”Given the “pulse” of the local administration and Indian government, Mali remarked that Unocoin would have been wiser to first announce its plans before attempting to proceed with installation.The nature of that “pulse” was made all the more glaringly apparent the following day, Oct. 25, when the president of a major Indian nonprofit trade organization, the National Association of Software and Services Companies (NASSCOM), was cited by local newspaper, the Hindu, as saying that, from NASSCOM’s perspective, “it is very clear that cryptocurrencies were illegal”:“It is law of the land and hence, we have to work with it. If we do not agree, we have to go back to the government and speak about why cryptocurrencies aren’t correct”Somewhat softening her stance, she added that “the genesis of this problem lies in the failure of policy making not keeping pace with rapid technological changes,” saying that “synergizing” the two would be NASSCOM’s focus.In response to the startup community’s “backlash,” NASSCOM was soon forced to promptly issue an official clarificatory statement “regarding cryptocurrencies,” tweeting:NASSCOM statement - 'Regarding crypto-currencies' pic.twitter.com/YSb2RJLQJpAs of press time, both Vishwanath and Harish BV have been released. The former has given a short statement on Twitter, confirming that the troublesome term of “ATM” was “the trigger” for the police attention:You know the story so far. From my understanding, main stream media calling crypto assets illegal & comparing our Kiosk with a bank ATM [that needs RBI perm as it is like a bank branch] was the trigger. Now that I am out,will try my best to give clarifications & move on. @UnocoinWhile grim rumblings in the press continue to stoke FUD, the Supreme Court has given a firm deadline for the Ministry of Finance’s inter-disciplinary committee to file an affidavit clarifying two points, as Crypto Kanoon’s post on Oct. 26 indicates:Read ORDER of the Supreme Court!Govt. to file Affidavit within 2 weeks stating:1. the stage at wch Committee is deliberating the matter;2. the estimated time within which the Government will ultimately come out with its policy decision.@coindesk @Cointelegraph pic.twitter.com/ul2Cbd1wIDThe committee, as noted, was established in spring 2017, and is headed by Subhash Chandra Garg, secretary at the Department of Economic Affairs, with members including SEBI chairman Ajay Tyagi and RBI deputy governor BP Kanungo.After almost seven months of lingering uncertainty over the future fate of crypto in India, much havoc has already been wrought.In mid-October, Zebpay registered its office on the crypto-friendly island of Malta, providing trading services for residents of 20 countries, excluding India — a move that arguably bears out tech investor Tim Draper’s April warnings that RBI’ stance would cause a brain drain and prove to be “a huge mistake.”Kashif Raza nonetheless considers that “the court’s intervention will help the industry have some clarity on this matter, positive or negative, whatever the outcome… right now there is a lot of confusion, so the step taken by the Supreme Court is very good news for the industry.”Prashant Mali concurred, and added his own specific proposal that:“I feel India should declare crypto to be a commodity, with SEBI regulating in equal measure. The RBI and government may have their own issues, but killing innovation is not good when ‘Digital India’ is purportedly a flagship program. The more the government keeps crypto in a lawless vacuum, the more it will be used in the black market and in hawala* transactions. This also means a loss of tax and revenue for the government, not to mention the loss of the progressive attitude for which it is known.”*Hawala is defined as “an alternative remittance channel that exists outside of traditional banking systems,” which relies heavily on trust between brokers.In its latest annual report, SEBI in fact revealed it had been organizing study tours to help its officials “engage with international regulators and gain deeper understanding of the systems and mechanisms” of crypto and initial coin offerings (ICOs).Recent reports have further indicated the government is mulling a ban on the trading of anonymity-oriented cryptocurrencies, leaving open the question of whether or not crypto trading more broadly may be permitted. The question remains moot. Local innovators can only hope that such inklings of proactive engagement will translate into a bold and progressive final verdict come November."

It’s very slow in handling payments. It has difficulty because of its very decentralized nature.”Having been present during Yellen’s speech, Satoshi Portal CEO Francis Pouliot was among the first to denounce her words on social media, describing them as “The Official NPC [non-player character] guidelines to Bitcoin FUD, courtesy of the FED.”At a press conference in December of last year, Yellen similarly called Bitcoin a “highly speculative asset” and “not a stable source of value."" She also noted that the Fed was not “seriously considering” the concept of a state-issued digital currency at that time.  Yellen’s speech Monday echos not only her own previous comments on crypto, but also those made earlier this month by economist Nouriel Roubini, an outspoken cryptocurrency naysayer who foresees the entire ecosystem failing.Commentators have taken Roubini to task over his comments, arguing his lack of understanding of decentralized cryptocurrency has led him, like Yellen, to draw false conclusions about its resilience.“I can see a bubble when there is one – and to me, this entire space has been the mother and the father of all financial bubbles and now it’s [going to] burst,” he told Cointelegraph during an appearance at BlockShow Americas in August."

The letter continues dramatically:“Have a nice life. You will now discover me when pissed off.”While Wright has yet to comment on the validity of the email, rhetoric has continued to come from his Twitter account, certain posts capturing the imagination of online commentators.Summarizing his feud with Ver, the analyst known as Ray[Redacted] highlighted further accusations by Wright that both Ver and Bitmain CEO Jihan Wu, who also supports ABC, wanted to promote child pornography.“This is the ONLY real use case they have and it is not happening!” Wright wrote on Twitter Thursday.At press time Nov. 9, the anger continued, Wright adopting a curious tone about his own BCH faction, describing it as “not tolerant” of alternative proposals.“ABC care about many coins and experiments. We (SV) care ONLY for the original version of Bitcoin,” he tweeted, adding:“We are NOT tolerant. We will not capitulate. We will not surrender. We will not negotiate. We will not end.”BCH/USD has dropped more in the past 24 hours than any of the top ten altcoins, losing 4.8 percent to trade around $570."

However, both Cointelegraph’s Chinese sources and local media have stated that the contents of the book, including the first page with its opening chapter title, “What is Bitcoin?,” remain intact.Antonopolous himself has tweeted remarks that confirm the content has been preserved, offering a positive response Oct. 25:“How cool is this: ""Mastering Bitcoin 1Ed"", on Chinese national TV. Even with a slightly sanitized title (no mention of Bitcoin), the content is the same. Hoping to visiting China next year. Maybe this brings more opportunities and conference invitations.”CCTV’s promotion of the Chinese version of the 1st edition of Antonopolous’ bookWhile the strategy to diminish the prominence of the coin in the book’s title appears congruous with China’s hardline stance against decentralized cryptocurrencies, the residual inclusion of the original English and choice to preserve the substance of the text was differently interpreted by community commentators.One argued against Antonopoulos’ gloss of “sanitized,” as being too mild, while others heralded the mainstream exposure and translated edition as a positive endorsement of innovation.Since 2013, Bitcoin has not been recognized as legal tender in China, and financial institutions have been prohibited from crypto dealings. China’s historic Sept. 2017 ban on crypto exchanges and Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) was followed by increasingly stringent restrictions throughout 2018, with a further bout of anti-crypto measures both online and offline introduced this summer.Nonetheless, as the editorial choice to amend Antonopolous’ title reflects, the country has been pursuing a long-term vision of blockchain integration, spearheaded by its central bank, and was reported to have filed more blockchain tech patents than any other in 2017.Just this week, a Chinese arbitration court ruled to affirm that Bitcoin and other cryptos are legally protected as property, and can thus be privately held and transferred."

The blockchain and cryptocurrency conference will attract over 100 of the top industry leaders and crypto influencers, and more than 2000 attendees, from over 50 countries. The venue for this event will be held at one of the most beautiful locations in Singapore, the Marina Bay Sands Luxury Hotel.","This year’s lineup of speakers at Asia Blockchain Week include Crypto-Congressman and Taiwan Legislator Jason Hsu; CTO at IBM, Former Head of Innovation at Mas, Stanley Yong; Co-founder & Managing Partner at Kenetic, Co-Founder Social Alpha Foundation, Jehan Chu; Co-founder of BTCC and Board Member of the Bitcoin Foundation, Bobby Lee; Partner at DFJDragon Fund/ DraperDragon Fund, Richard Wang; Partner at Fenbushi Capital, Remington Ong; Blockchain Educator, Founder of Boxmining, Michael Gu; Partner at Sora Ventures, Former Managing Director at JRR Crypto, Vanessa Cao; Partner at Global Blockchain Innovative Capital, named as top 10 most influential crypto funds by 36kr (TechCrunch of China) and ODaily (Chinese Blockchain Media) will be present on the stage, Sinhae Lee, and many more leading industry professionals.One of the most anticipated speakers, Mr. Thomas Lee, is a Fundstrat Global Advisors co-founder and a Wall Street analyst with over 25 years of equity research experience. He has consistently been ranked as the top institutional investor every year since 1998. Thomas Lee was one of the first “traditional finance” professionals that was talking about Bitcoin, and he is well-known for his positive attitude towards cryptocurrency.Some of his recent quotes are: “Ethereum will rally strongly up to $ 1,900 by the end of 2019” and “Bitcoin could end the year explosively higher,” referring to an upcoming Bitcoin and cryptocurrency market trend reversal.The BlockShow team met with Mr. Thomas Lee during BlockShow Americas in Las Vegas to ask him why he believes Bitcoin will have a great next year, and whether he is expecting a financial crisis to happen imminently.  BlockShow: In your opinion, what will be the most profitable cryptocurrency next year? Will it be one of the well known currencies or do you expect some new players to have conquered the market?Mr. Thomas Lee: That is always very challenging to predict but I am sure it will be a token or coin with the best growth in active users. In the past year we saw the best performing cryptocurrencies have had the best growth in active users (e.g. EOS, XLM, BTC and DOGE). I at least expect Bitcoin to be one of the most profitable cryptocurrencies next year.BlockShow: When will Bitcoin break out of its long-run bear trend?Mr. Thomas Lee: Bitcoin is preparing to break out. It has found support around the $6,000 level, which equals the breakeven for mining costs.BlockShow: What do you think about the prediction of J.P. Morgan, that the next major financial crisis will strike the U.S. economy by 2020? Is that something you can agree with?Mr. Thomas Lee: In my opinion, a financial crisis will be inevitable to take place but the exact timing will quite uncertain. There is a greater leverage today and the global central banks have less “wiggle” room because of the current low rates. With that being said, I am not expecting an imminent crisis.BlockShow: Do you believe it will be possible, that the entire Asian region will become crypto-friendly in the future?Mr. Thomas Lee: Asia is a region where I expect crypto to flourish. There is a large population of young people and countries are technically savvy. Also, there are already extensive use-cases of digital money and platforms such as WeChat and others.BlockShow: How do you think events influence the blockchain industry?Mr. Thomas Lee: Blockchain is dependent on community support and conferences and events allow communities to gather.BlockShow: What is your opinion on the U.S. Dollar backed stablecoin USDT? What do you expect?Mr. Thomas Lee: I am comfortable that USDT is backed by USD and I have confidence in the Tether team.BlockShow: What do you expect from stablecoins?Mr. Thomas Lee: Stablecoins are a novel idea and I hope they work.Asia Blockchain Week ticketsTickets are available on the official BlockShow Asia website.

CEO Elon Musk and promote fraudulent Bitcoin scams.","Nov 5, 2018","Several verified Twitter accounts have been hacked to impersonate Elon Musk today, Nov. 5, with one reportedly collecting almost $170,000.","After compromising verified accounts, scammers changed the profile name and picture in order to pose as the Tesla CEO. Scammers would then post in comment threads started by the real Elon Musk, so as to give the impression of legitimacy. Some of the scam tweets said that Elon Musk was conducting “the biggest” crypto-giveaway in the world for those who use “Bitcoic” (read Bitcoin), and provided a link to “participate” in the giveaway.Screenshot of compromised Pathe UK account. Source: Business InsiderTo skirt Twitter security measures, scammers subtly changed one of the characters in the name, while still maintaining a display name that appeared to be “Elon Musk” at a glance, preculding Twitter from automatically flagging the account.Hackers reportedly compromised several different accounts, including those of film production firm Pathe U.K. and U.S. politician Frank Pallone Jr.Daily Beast reporter Lachlan Markay reported that sources on Pallone’s campaign confirmed the account was hacked, albeit without any political goals saying, “Just looks like a Bitcoin Scam.”If you fall for this you deserve to be scammed tbh pic.twitter.com/RKjd90UsBtHe subsequently added that one of the BTC wallets used in the scams received $158,256 and that the payments “are still coming.” At press time, the address referred to by Markay had a final balance of 26.38 BTC ($168,930).Pathe U.K. later confirmed that it had recovered control of its account and deleted the fake Elon Musk tweets.Other high-profile individuals in the crypto and tech space have been similarly impersonated. In April, founder and CEO of Telegram Pavel Durov tweeted a warning, telling his followers that the messaging app was experiencing downtime due to its server clusters overheating. Durov’s tweet drew attention to fake crypto giveaway scammers who posed as the Telegram CEO and claimed to offer crypto to users as a “thank you for [their] support.”In January, Twitter saw an influx of Litecoin (LTC) founder “Charlie Lee” impersonators, with multiple imposters posing as the LTC creator and promoting a fake LTC giveaway. Most of the scammers were using Twitter handles with names very similar to the real Charlie Lee, @SatoshiLite, such as @SatoshiLitez and @SatoshiLitee_.In September, Elon Musk asked Jackson Palmer, the creator of Dogecoin (DOGE), to help him combat ""annoying"" cryptocurrency scammers on Twitter. Palmer replied almost immediately, urging Musk to reach out to him using direct messages. Later on, the creator of Dogecoin sent Musk a script that could purportedly solve the problem."

He is reported to have accepted payment either cash in hand, through ATMs, or through MoneyGram.Burrell further admitted that his account on an unnamed “U.S.-based, regulated” crypto exchange had been closed after coming under scrutiny for “suspicious” transactions. He then turned to a Hong Kong-based platform, through which he is said to have purchased $3.29 million worth in Bitcoin between March 2015-April 2017 in “hundreds” of individual transactions.The press release lastly outlines that Burrell has admitted that he exchanged his U.S. fiat currency, which he stored in Mexico, with a San Diego-based precious metals dealer, Joseph Castillo. The latter has reportedly pleaded guilty to making a false declaration on his federal tax returns, for which he awaits sentencing Dec. 13.Burrell and unnamed “others” are said to have daily imported over $1 million between late 2016 and early this year, in amounts just below the $10, 000 threshold at which the money would have to be declared.Burrell will be sentenced Feb. 11 2019, facing a maximum sentence of five years behind bars. He has agreed to forfeit over $800,000 to the U.S. in his plea agreement.The press release cites U.S. attorney Adam Braverman as saying that:“Unlicensed money transmitting businesses, especially those operating at or near the border, pose a serious threat to the integrity of the US banking system, and provide an ‘open door’ for criminals to utilize such businesses to launder the proceeds of their illicit activities.”As reported this June, an L.A.-based trader, who acted under the pseudonym “Bitcoin Maven,” was prosecuted for running an unregistered multi-million dollar Bitcoin-fiat money transmitting business, also via a LocalBitcoins.com listing."

Vullo placed a strong emphasis on “implementing strong regulatory safeguards” while fostering the “responsible growth of financial innovation.”As the press release outlines, NYDFS has proactively responded to bringing technology-based financial innovation under its regulatory purview, and has to date approved twelve charters or licenses for firms in the virtual currency sector.NYDFS has been a key player in the launch of a suite of new stablecoins this fall, including the U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin from blockchain trust company Paxos, and that of the Winklevoss Twins’, dubbed Gemini dollar, which both launched September 10."

Browne is a senior managing director and head of ETF trading at financial services firm Cantor Fitzgerald.","Founded in 1945, Cantor Fitzgerald focuses on institutional equity, fixed income sales, and trading. The company reportedly has over 5,000 institutional clients, which includes such fields as investment banking, prime brokerage, and commercial real estate.Speaking at Georgetown University's Financial Markets Quality Conference in Washington D.C., Browne reportedly said that BTC ETFs will be approved only after the development of a strong regulatory framework in the industry. Addressing the current state of BTC ETFs, Browne stated:""It's very difficult for the [Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)] to wrap their heads around a positive approval because there's no data yet ... the markets just aren't here.""Earlier today, the CEO of investment management corporation BlackRock Larry Fink suggested that the independence and anonymity that cryptocurrencies confer remains a barrier to the approval of crypto-based ETFs.Following some widely publicized rejections of BTC ETF applications by the U.S. SEC, the CEO of crypto payment startup Abra Bill Barhydt suggested that the reason the SEC has insofar denied crypto ETFs is because the crypto industry does not fit the applicant archetype. In particular, the SEC has rejected crypto ETF applications because “people who are doing the applications don't fit mold of who the SEC is used to approving.""In August, the SEC temporarily rejected nine applications to list and trade various BTC ETFs from three companies, including ProShares, Direxion, and GraniteShares. The regulator previously denied the application for a BTC ETF by brothers Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss. The SEC then justified its rejection by saying that “the record before the Commission does not support such a conclusion.”"

However, the official refrained from naming the app.The spokesperson reportedly explained that the attackers exploited a third-party marketing solution to launch a Bitcoin (BTC) giveaway from several verified accounts, including Google’s G Suite and major U.S. department store retailer Target.The information was implicitly confirmed by Target. Its representatives told TNW that the hackers used a third-party marketing app, authorized to post content on Target’s behalf.As Cointelegraph previously reported, on Wednesday, Nov. 14, hackers took over G Suite and Target accounts (800,000 and 1.92 million followers, respectively) and posted malicious cryptocurrency giveaway links. The message in G Suite’s account also falsely claimed that users could make payments in G Suite using cryptocurrencies.Moreover, in early November several verified Twitter accounts, including those of film production firm Pathe U.K. and U.S. politician Frank Pallone Jr., were breached to pose as Elon Musk. Once hackers gained control of accounts, they changed the profile picture and name in order to pose as Elon Musk and offer scammy Bitcoin giveaways.Bitcoin scammers have already posed as Elon Musk for several times, prompting the Tesla founder to seek help from Jackson Palmer, the creator of Dogecoin (DOGE), who claimed to have invented an anti-scam script."

(GBI) and its CEO Nicholas Gelfman to pay over $2.5 million for operating a fraudulent Ponzi scheme, according to an official announcement published Oct. 18.","GBI is a New York-based corporation and denominated Bitcoin (BTC) hedge fund incorporated in 2014. As stated on the company’s website, by 2015 it had 85 customers and 2,367 BTC under management.The order is the continuation of the initial anti-fraud enforcement action filed by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) against GBI in September 2017. The CFTC charged GBI for allegedly running a Ponzi scheme from 2014 to 2016, telling investors that it had developed a computer algorithm called “Jigsaw” which allowed for substantial returns through a commodity fund. In reality, the entire scheme was a fraud.Per the announcement, GBI and Gelfman fraudulently solicited over $600,000 from at least 80 customers. Moreover, Gelfman set up a fake computer “hack” to conceal the scheme’s trading losses. It eventually resulted in the loss of almost all customer funds.The current order charges GBI and Gelfman to pay over $2.5 million in civil monetary penalties and restitution. GBI and Gelfman are ordered to pay $554,734.48 and $492,064.53 in restitution to customers and $1,854,000 and $177,501 in civil monetary penalties, respectively.James McDonald, the CFTC’s Director of Enforcement, said that “this case marks yet another victory for the Commission in the virtual currency enforcement arena. As this string of cases shows, the CFTC is determined to identify bad actors in these virtual currency markets and hold them accountable.”Last month, the CFTC filed a suit with the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas against two defendants for the allegedly fraudulent solicitation of BTC. Per the suit, defendants Morgan Hunt and Kim Hecroft were running two fraudulent businesses and misleading the public to invest in leveraged or margined foreign currency contracts, such as forex, binary options, and diamonds."

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.","The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.Bitcoin’s White Paper was published ten years ago, today. From an obscure beginning in 2008, Bitcoin has become a worldwide phenomenon. Thousands of cryptocurrencies have been born since then, but Bitcoin has managed to maintain its relevance. Currently, its dominance over the market is hovering around the 54 percent mark.In the past ten years, Bitcoin has witnessed wild swings. From being valued 2,300.03 Bitcoin for $1 in October 2009, its price rose to a high of $19,531.9 per single coin in late 2017. Such a huge appreciation is unprecedented in any other asset class.With such an impressive rise, Bitcoin has attracted several supporters and critics alike. Many traditional investors and economists remain skeptical of Bitcoin, whereas many millennials and technology enthusiasts see a bright future for it in the next decade. Analysts have set very aggressive targets for Bitcoin in the next few years.Though the next decade will continue to attract new investors to Bitcoin, a parabolic rise similar to that of the first decade, is unlikely. The rise will be more measured and gradual with sporadic spurts in between.Bitcoin is looking weak. There are no signs of a pullback yet. The RSI has dipped into the negative territory, and the 20-day EMA is turning down, which shows that the bears have an upper hand in the short-term. A fall to $6,200 and thereafter a retest of the $5,900–$6,075.04 support zone looks probable.The failure of the bulls to capitalize on the break out of the descending triangle is a negative sign. If the bears sink the BTC/USD pair below $5,900, a quick fall to $5,450, and further to $5,000 is possible.Cyclically, the digital currency closes the year with strength. In the past three years, November and December have been strong months. Therefore, we anticipate a similar move this year. If the bulls succeed in breaking out of $6,831.99, a rally to $7,400 is likely. Traders who own long positions can keep their stops at $5,900.  Ethereum has been trading below $200 for the past three days. A retest of the $188.35 mark, which has held on the two previous occasions, is likely.  The 20-day EMA is turning down and the RSI is in the negative territory, which suggests that the short-term trend is down. A break of $188.35 can push the price to the next lower level of $167.32, which should act as a strong support. A break of this level will be negative, sinking the pair to the next support at $136.The trend on the ETH/USD pair will change if the bulls break out of $249.93. Such a move is likely to attract buyers, who can push the price to the next resistance at $322.57.Ripple has been trading in a tight range since Oct. 16. The RSI is also close to the midpoint. This shows balance between supply and demand.The XRP/USD pair will either break out or break down of this tight range within the next few days. Traders can buy a breakout and close (UTC time frame) above $0.48, with the stop loss at $0.42. A rally to $0.55, followed by a move to $0.62 is possible.On the other hand, if the bears break down of the tight range, a fall to the next support zone of $0.37185–$0.38838 is probable.  Bitcoin Cash broke down of the symmetrical triangle on Oct. 29. An attempt to climb back into the triangle failed on Oct. 30. If the price slides below the Sept. 11 low of $408.0182, we anticipate a fall to the next support at $300. Therefore, traders who are long can keep their stops at $400.The declining 20-day EMA and the RSI in the negative zone show that the sellers are in command. The bearish view will be invalidated if the BCH/USD pair bounces from the current levels and breaks out of $500. Until then, the rallies will be sold into.The bulls are attempting to hold EOS above $5. However, they have not been able to achieve a bounce, which shows a lack of buying at higher levels.If the EOS/USD pair breaks down of $5, it can drop to the next support at $4.49, and below that to $3.8723. Therefore, traders can keep the stops on their long positions at $4.9.If the bulls push the price above the moving averages, a rally to $6.1, followed by a move to the top of the range at $6.8299 is likely. The trend will reverse if the price sustains above the top of the range.The bulls might attempt to support Stellar at the trendline, below which a fall to the next support at $0.2 is probable.If the bounce from the current level scales above the moving averages and the downtrend line of the descending triangle, it will signal a change in trend. The XLM/USD pair can be purchased on a breakout above $0.27, which can result in a rally to $0.36, with a minor resistance at $0.304.Though Litecoin has broken below the support at $49.466, the bulls are trying to defend the Sept. 12 intraday low of $47.166. If this level breaks, a fall to $40 is possible.If the LTC/USD pair bounces from the current levels, it will face resistance at the moving averages, which are trending down, and the downtrend line of the descending triangle.A break out of $60 will indicate the probability of a change in trend that will be confirmed on a close above $69.279. We shall wait for a new buy setup to form before suggesting a trade on the pair.Cardano has continued its journey southward after breaking down of the symmetrical triangle. It can drop to $0.060105, which will act as a strong support. If the bears sink the price below $0.060105, the downtrend will resume.The bulls are trying to hold the immediate support at $0.068989. If the virtual currency rebounds from the current levels and breaks out of the moving averages, a rally to the top of the range is probable.The ADA/USD pair will signal a reversal if it sustains above the range. The traders should wait for buying to resume before initiating any long positions.The bulls are attempting to defend the support at $100.453, whereas the bears are stalling the pullback at the 20-day EMA. Monero will correct to $90 if it plunges below $100.453, and will move up to $112.5 if it breaks out of the 20-day EMA. A break out of $112.5 might carry the cryptocurrency to $128.65.Below $100.453, the XMR/USD pair can correct to the bottom of the $81–$150 large range. If the price bounces strongly from $81, we might suggest a long position on the pair. However, if the bears break this support, a fall to $61 is probable.TRON continues to slide lower, towards the next support zone of$0.0183–$0.0225. The moving averages are still flat, which suggests that the range bound action is likely to continue.A break and close (UTC time frame) below $0.0183 will resume the downtrend that can extend to the next support at $0.01095383.The TRX/USD pair will show signs of a turnaround if it scales $0.03. The breakout can carry the price to the next overhead resistance at $0.0415.The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. The charts for the analysis are provided by TradingView."

The breach was discovered when the Internal Security Division in the city of Yaroslavl noticed the intruder’s attempt to hack their equipment.The alleged hacker was then charged with deliberate use of software that “neutralizes” a computer’s network defense “out of self-interest.” Under this article he could face up to five years in prison, if found guilty.As Cointelegraph previously wrote in a review of illicit mining cases, stealing or illicitly receiving electricity then used to mine is often the crime punished by prison terms, rather than the mining itself. For instance, in South Korea this April, police arrested miners who purposely rented out factories and chicken farms to receive electricity for substantially lower rates.Further, in another case in the U.S. state of New York this March, local authorities asked miners to cease their work after residents of one town filed an official complaint to the police for the excessive usage of low-cost electricity by local miners.More recently, this month a Chinese man was reportedly sentenced 3.5 years in jail for stealing electricity from a train station to fuel his Bitcoin mining facility. In addition to the prison sentence, he was also fined 100,000 yuan (around $14,500)."

Today’s tweet from the company reads:“We are officially announcing the release of our new 7nm miners which possess industry-leading hash rates designed to mine with the SHA256 algorithm. Two models will be offered, the Antminer S15 and T15. Available for purchase on 11/8 [Nov. 8].”In Bitmain CEO and co-founder Jihan Wu’s keynote lecture in September, he outlined that the new chip integrates “more than a billion transistors,” using a special circuit structure and low power-intensive technology to optimize efficiency. Wu claimed that tests have shown the chip “can achieve a ratio of energy consumption to the mining capacity that is as low as 42J/T.”Bitmain has also made headlines this week by announcing it would be rolling out a firmware update for so-called ‘Overt AsicBoost’ to all its Antminer models, which it claims will increase mining “effectiveness” on the machines.Crypto’s mining titans have been hot on each other’s heels to compete for the edge in advanced mining hardware; just a day ahead of Bitmain in September, Bitfury Group unveiled its own 14nm ASIC chip, dubbed Bitfury Clarke, which is customized for SHA256 Bitcoin mining. Bitfury’s chip can reportedly “execute a hashrate up to 120 gigahashes per second (GH/s) and a power efficiency rate as low as 55 millijoules per gigahash (mJ/GH).”Just today, Bitfury revealed it had raised $80 million in a closed funding round led by European venture capital fund Korelya Capital. Other participants included South Korean internet giant Naver Group, Asian institutions Macquarie Capital and Dentsu Japan, as well as Michael Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital.Yesterday, Nov. 5, just a week after reporting that crypto-mining related sales were “negligible” in Q3 2018, U.S.-based semiconductor manufacturer AMD evidently partnered with seven major tech companies to produce eight new cryptocurrency mining rigs it is marketing as “blockchain compute solutions.”"

But in fact, only a few mining farms can satisfy their demand.”An unnamed source “familiar with the matter” has claimed that “half of [Bitmain’s] marketing staff have gone to Xinjiang to talk with local mining operators about deploying equipment.”As DeepChain outlines, the power glut in coal-rich regions such as Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia has been advantageous for firms such as Bitmain, as hydropower stations in southwest China have been unable to supply sufficient power to meet their energy-intensive needs.Beijing-born Bitmain, which is a major holder of Bitcoin Cash, is backing BCH client Bitcoin ABC, which has spearheaded the forthcoming hard fork. ABC’s proposed scalability upgrades have been starkly opposed by an opposing camp, nChain, led by self-proclaimed “Satoshi Nakomoto” Craig S. Wright.Wright is advocating for a BCH protocol known as Bitcoin-SV (BSV), but so far major mining pools such as BTC.com, AntPool, Btc.top, ViaBTC, Bitcoin.com have all backed Bitcoin ABC, as DeepChain further reports.CoinGeek, reportedly the largest BCH mining pool, BMG, and SBI have all backed BSV, according to DeepChain, which further reports that some Chinese miners plan to mine BSV as early as Nov. 10 as a “warm-up” to ensure maximum efficiency by the time the fork is initiated.Notably, largest global crypto trading platform Binance has recently announced its support of the hard fork, a possible reason for the recent major price hike of the asset.As of press time, Bitcoin Cash is trading at $600.94, up 46.1 percent since Nov.1. As DeepChain notes, Binance has been joined by leading U.S. crypto exchange Coinbase in endorsing the network upgrade.Bitmain continues to compete with other mining hardware makers to have the technological edge; this week, the firm released two new 7nm (nanometer) Antminers, equipped with next-generation ASIC chips."

When asked about missing cryptocurrencies, Kim falsely claimed that security issues made him transfer digital currencies to several accounts. Shortly after, the misappropriation was discovered and Kim was fired.Kim reportedly then defrauded private investors in order to return funds to his employer. According to the CFTC, he lured around $545,000 worth of cryptocurrencies from five individuals, falsely stating that he had left the company voluntarily to start his own trading company. Kim later lost all the investors’ funds following a high-risk bet.Given the circumstances of the case, the CFTC has ordered Kim to pay $1.1 million in restitution to his company and customers. Moreover, the commission has imposed a permanent trading and solicitation ban on him.In a separate criminal action brought by the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois, Kim pleaded guilty to defrauding his employer and misappropriating private investors’ funds, and has received a 15 month sentence.The CFTC Director of Enforcement, James McDonald, says the commission will continue to cooperate with the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) and the FBI in order to prevent crypto-related crimes.Earlier this month, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charged Zachary Coburn, the founder of crypto token trading platform EtherDelta, with operating an unregistered securities exchange.

Once a bid is set, the participants won't be able to change it or to view other bids.The agency states that Bitcoins for the bid were seized in various federal criminal, civil, and administrative proceedings, including cases involving Theresa Tetley and Tomas Costanzo.As Cointelegraph previously wrote, Tetley faced prosecution in California for allegedly running an unregistered multimillion dollar Bitcoin-fiat money transmitting business. She reportedly reportedly earned at least $300,000 annually from her company, and later confessed to running an unregistered transactions service along with receiving money allegedly involved in drug trafficking.Costanzo was prosecuted back in 2017 for money laundering and running an unlicensed money transmission business.

Source: The Next WebAccording to the Hard Fork, the message disappeared barely more than 10 minutes after it had appeared. At press time, Google has not replied to Cointelegraph’s request for comment.The scam follows a recent pattern of fraudulent activity involving the Twitter accounts of high-profile companies and individuals. On Nov. 5, several verified Twitter accounts were hacked to impersonate Elon Musk, with one reportedly collecting almost $170,000. Scammers changed the profile name and picture in order to pose as the Tesla CEO, and subsequently posted in comment threads started by the real Elon Musk, so as to give the impression of legitimacy.As previously reported, Google introduced a ban on cryptocurrency advertisements on Jun. 1 to purportedly protect its customers from fraudulent offerings. The ban affected all Google products, meaning that companies would not be able to serve crypto-related ads on the search engine giant’s own sites, as well as third-party sites in its network.However, in September Google rolled back some of its restrictions, allowing some crypto businesses to advertise on its platform. Per the new policy, only registered cryptocurrency exchanges could advertise on the Google Adwords platform, targeting U.S. and Japanese audiences.In October, Google implemented new restrictions on Chrome Web Store extensions, which will  likely affect cryptojackers. Chrome extensions submitted to the Web Store would reportedly not be allowed if they contained “obfuscated” code. Google’s Oct. 1 post reads:“Today over 70% of malicious and policy violating extensions that we block from Chrome Web Store contain obfuscated code.”"

His lawyers are reportedly preparing to apply for bail.As per the Bangkok Post, in January Finnish investor Aarni Otava Saarimaa along with his Thai business partner Chonnikan Kaewkasee complained to the Thai Crime Suppression Division (CSD).

Key takeaways from the study were published Tuesday, Oct. 16, alongside the full annual report, entitled “Hi-Tech Crime Trends.”","The report, dedicated to hacks in 2017 and 2018, identifies the allegedly state-sponsored hacker group Lazarus as responsible for $571 million of the $882 million total in crypto that was stolen from online exchanges during the studied time period; almost 65 percent of the total sum.   Out of fourteen separate exchange breaches, five have been attributed to the group, among them the industry record-breaking $532 million NEM hack of Japan’s Coincheck this January.The report states that hackers target cryptocurrency exchanges using mostly “traditional” methods, including spear phishing, social engineering, and malware:“After the local network is successfully compromised [through downloaded malware], the hackers browse the local network to find work stations and servers used working with private cryptocurrency wallets.”The report, which also includes a cybercrime forecast, predicts the number of attacks on exchanges to increase in future, as an alternative to traditional targets such as banks.Group-IB further indicates that Initial Coin Offering (ICO) platforms are prime targets for hackers, revealing that 10 percent of total funds raised from token sales in 2017–2018 were stolen. A majority of illicit activity targeting ICOs was reportedly conducted through phishing methods, with Group-IB estimating that large phishing groups have the capacity to steal around $1 million a month.Additionally, Group-IB suggests that mining pools could prove an easy target for 51 percent attacks by state-sponsored hackers. Attempts at such attacks, albeit with limited success, are said to already be on the rise.U.S. experts have previously alleged that North Korea is ""increasingly"" turning to crypto as a tactic to circumvent sanctions, claiming that the country’s government is hiring people to “launder” cryptocurrencies via multiple wallets and exchanges, as well as so-called mixing services, with the aim of obtaining sanction-free U.S. dollars."

rates.) ... a cheaply made USB stick storing thousands of Bitcoins 
corrupted, ...","Nov 16, 2018",,"Before the internet brought us dog videos and your grandmother’s Facebook updates, losing money was a traumatic experience. Dropping $20 meant you’d probably never see it again – all you’d have left is that unmistakable sensation of feeling stupid.At least in the fiat world, it’s become a little bit harder to lose money. Centralized institutions mean you can recover usernames and passwords in a jiffy – answering a few security questions or showing your ID to regain access. Help is even available if you burn thousands of dollars in a fire, thanks to a specialist department that pieces them back together and exchanges them for shiny new notes.Unfortunately, this is one hurdle that the crypto industry has been struggling to overcome – and in some cases, the consequences have been eye-wateringly costly.Ownership of cryptocurrency is determined by who holds the private keys to these assets. Because of this, they are far more important than a password could ever be. Storing these codes on the cloud can be calamitous in case you get hacked, while holding them on your phone can be devastating if the device is lost, stolen or damaged. Crypto enthusiasts have heeded advice from experts by getting clever and recording them offline – using a USB stick or even an old-fashioned piece of paper – only to forget where they put it or throw it away without realizing its significance.Horror stories like this are well documented – including on Cointelegraph. Here’s looking at you, Welshman who threw away a hard drive which held 7,500 Bitcoin (worth about $47 million at today’s rates.) And let’s not forget you, anonymous Australian who fears his wife will go ballistic after a cheaply made USB stick storing thousands of Bitcoins corrupted, along with his dreams of infinite riches.Most of the time, nothing can be done when private keys are lost. It’s perhaps no surprise then that, last year, a digital forensics firm estimated that four million Bitcoins are gone forever. But although it might be a little bit too late for those who have already lost a fortune, new technology designed to help people recover their private keys is starting to emerge (and hopefully it’ll be a little bit more effective than relying on hypnosis).Some blockchain platforms believe “zero-knowledge proofs” – a relatively new concept in the cryptographic world which emerged in the 1980s – could transform attitudes to private keys, enabling them to be recovered without compromising security.The concept can be explained like this: being able to prove to somebody that you know something without actually revealing what you know.One well-known example is known as “Two Balls And The Colorblind Friend.” Let’s imagine you have a green and a red ball – identical in every way apart from color – and a friend who can’t tell the difference between them. Nonetheless, you want to prove they are different colors.Your colorblind companion would put the balls behind their back – and would reveal one of them. He would then put the balls behind his back again, bring one out and ask: “Did I switch the ball?”Given the difference in colors, it would be easy for you to say whether or not a switch has happened, but impossible for him to tell. Repeating this process over and over would help your friend realize they are different colors, because you’d always get the answer right. Crucially, you’ll never have revealed which ball is green and which is red.SovereignWallet uses zero-knowledge encryption to enable its users to recover their private keys by downloading the app on another smartphone should the device they normally use end up lost or broken. This is achievable because the key is encrypted with their password and PIN – and stored securely on the network’s server. As an alternative, they also have the option to retrieve private keys by relaying the mnemonic words which are generated at the time these codes are created.The platform, which enables crypto to be transferred in a messenger-style format and aims to create a happy medium between banking-grade security and usability, believes blockchain technology could help drive down the cost of remittances, where foreign workers send money across borders back home to their loved ones.Of course, the concern for cryptocurrency holders is that any mechanism which enables them to recover their private keys – however desirable – could put their funds at risk of being stolen by bad actors. This is why the zero-knowledge element of such measures is crucial.Returning to the example of the colorblind friend, imagine the red and the green ball represent passwords, and you’re the only person in the world who can see their color. This would mean a fraudster who tried to conduct the same experiment to convince your colorblind friend would end up making too many mistakes during the switching experiment – and fail to convince them – because they don’t know either.SovereignWallet also uses machine learning security in its infrastructure, technology that’s also relied upon by the likes of Palantir, the Silicon Valley tech giant founded by Peter Thiel.Instead of solely relying on a usernames and password, the crypto wallet monitors a user’s usage patterns and kicks into action whenever there is an anomaly. Additional authentication is needed whenever a user logs in on a new device, and successfully passing these extra measures result in them being automatically logged out of the smartphones they have used in the past. SovereignWallet says it strives to be a “smart application that can think and not be deceived easily” through a range of other features, too, such as technology which stops the app being used on PC-based emulator programs instead of a real smartphone.Disclaimer.

Brief introduction to both sides of ...","Nov 6, 2018","On November 2, details of a crypto lawsuit featuring major industry players: Bitcoin Foundation founder Charlie Shrem on one side, and the Winklevoss twins on the other, were made public. The case alleges that Shrem “stole” around 5,000 Bitcoin (BTC) from Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss in 2012.","Charlie ShremCharlie Shrem is an American entrepreneur and renowned Bitcoin advocate. He started investing in Bitcoin in 2011, when he was a college senior. Later the same year, he co-founded the now-defunct BitInstant, one of the first crypto exchanges. The service turned out to be profitable “almost from day one,” as per an article in the Verge.Through 2011-2012, BitInstant received a couple of major investments, including a $1.5 million stake from a group of investors led by Winklevoss Capital Management. Meanwhile, Shrem became a founding board member of Bitcoin Foundation, the trade association that promotes cryptocurrency.In July 2013, BitInstant was hit with a class-action lawsuit for “false representation of service.” The company reportedly filed a motion to dismiss it, but several days later, the exchange was closed. According to a blog post (which is no longer available but is cached here), it went offline ""to improve the code based on trends [the company] noticed.""On Jan. 26, 2014, Shrem was arrested at JFK Airport in New York. He was then found guilty of conspiring to launder $1 million worth of BTC, to help users of the Silk Road marketplace anonymously make illegal purchases, namely drugs. On April 10, 2014 he was indicted on accusations of ""operating an unlicensed money transmitting business, money laundering conspiracy, and willfully failing to file suspicious activity reports with banking authorities."" On Sep. 4, 2014, he pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of aiding unlicensed money transmission, was ordered to pay $950,000, and sentenced to two years in prison. He was released from federal prison in Pennsylvania around June 2016.Since his release, Shrem has been involved with a number of crypto-related projects, including, among others, a Dash-branded and Dash-accepting debit card, a multi-coin, multi-platform cryptocurrency wallet, and an advisory firm that helps clients trade in digital assets.The Winklevoss twins Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, in turn, are American internet entrepreneurs, most famous for co-founding HarvardConnection (currently known as ConnectU) and suing Mark Zuckerberg, for allegedly stealing their idea to create a Facebook-like social network site. This case ultimately landed them $65 million, and the brothers invested $11 million of their payout into BTC in 2013, allegedly amassing one percent of the entire currency’s dollar value equivalent at the time.Most notable crypto projects led by the Winklevoss include Winkdex — a financial index that tracks the price of Bitcoin launched in 2014 — and Gemini — a crypto exchange that received regulatory approval from the New York State Department of Financial Services in October 2015.In December 2017, the Winklevoss brothers became Bitcoin billionaires due to the large investments into the cryptocurrency made in the past.The details of the lawsuit, which were reported by the NYT on November 2, suggest that Shrem “helped get the brothers interested in Bitcoin in 2012 and became their first adviser in the young industry.”More specifically, the Winklevoss twins allegedly gave Shrem $750,000 to buy BTC for them “from other deep-pocketed investors.”“A few months into this partnership,” the brothers claim, they realized that Shrem had not given them back all the Bitcoin they were owed. Thus, while Winklevoss gave Shrem $250,000 in September 2012, he delivered back only around $189,000 worth of BTC at the going price, which was around $12.50, according to court documents. The brothers were missing $61,000 worth of BTC — roughly 5,000 coins, as per the price at the time — and have not been repaid since, they claim.After asking Shrem “numerous times” for an accounting of the BTC he had purchased for them, the Winklevii eventually turned to an accountant who documented the missing funds, the lawsuit details suggest. Specifically, the enclosed court documents feature an email Cameron Winklevoss purportedly wrote to Shrem in 2013:“I have been patient, and at this point it’s getting a bit absurd [...] I don’t take this lightly.”In a post-prison interview with WNYC Studios, Shrem claimed he had little funds left after release. Specifically, he said he worked as a dishwasher and owned just a few BTC, which he didn’t hold because “he can’t speculate with [his] rent”. Nevertheless, the lawsuit mentions some flamboyant purchases, which turned out to be the last straw for the Winklevoss twins. Cameron Winklevoss told the NYT:“When he purchased $4 million in real estate, two Maseratis and two powerboats, we decided it was time to get to the bottom of it.”The news outlet additionally states that Shrem’s acquisitions include “a $2 million house in Florida.”The brothers hired a private investigator, who reportedly traced the stolen funds on the blockchain. He allegedly discovered that 5,000 BTC were transferred in 2013, through addresses “associated with Mr. Shrem” and onto Xapo and Coinbase wallet services.“Either Shrem has been incredibly lucky and successful since leaving prison, or — more likely — he ‘acquired’ his six properties, two Maseratis, two powerboats and other holdings with the appreciated value of the 5,000 Bitcoin he stole from” the twins during their business agreement in 2012, the case brought to court claims.Interestingly, the same judge who imposed Shrem’s sentence in 2014 — Jed S. Rakoff, a judge in the Federal District Court for the Southern District of New York — was appointed to the fresh case.According to the NYT article, Judge Rakoff has already approved the Winklevoss brothers’ application to freeze any funds that Shrem holds with Xapo and Coinbase, as he supposedly held the assets on those wallet services. Moreover, Judge Rakoff wrote in his order that Shrem had “evidenced an intent to frustrate the collection efforts of his creditors.”For now the court fight seems to be in favor of the Winklevoss twins, who seem determined to see Shrem prosecuted again.Meanwhile, Shrem’s lawyer, Brian Klein, believes that claims made by the Winklevoss twins are unfounded. He said in a statement quoted by the NYT:“The lawsuit erroneously alleges that about six years ago Charlie essentially misappropriated thousands of Bitcoins [...] Nothing could be further from the truth. Charlie plans to vigorously defend himself and quickly clear his name.”Cointelegraph has reached out to Charlie Shrem and his lawyer for further comment, but both have not replied to date."

If the next several days show ABC ahead of SV, then SV is not able to conduct a 51 percent attack on BCH.Source: Coin.danceAs such, Kelly explained that the downtrend of Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market is likely to be short-lived.“People are concerned that both Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash markets, their networks might slow down, they might not work as well, the software upgrade may not go through or if it does go through, we will end up with some chaos. People started selling, that triggered stops, everybody got concerned. The entire market settled down. In my view, a very short-term event.”Crypto Rand, cryptocurrency trader and technical analyst, told Cointelegraph that even before the Bitcoin Cash hard fork, Bitcoin hovered above an uptrend support. Its continuous retest of the level led its momentum and strength in the low $6,000 region to decline significantly.“I don't think there is a huge conspiracy against Bitcoin behind the drop. BTC has been hovering over a slight uptrend support. But we can see how every time that BTC touched that support it bounced with less and less strength while continuing a downtrend on volume. That points out a weak setup, what was seeing as stability can be considered also as lack of strength to push new higher lows and define a stronger uptrend.”Currently, the majority of investors and traders in the market remain hesitant towards engaging in large positions or taking high-risk, high-return trades, mostly due to poor market conditions. Volumes are weak, trading activity is low, and the sheer intensity of the recent drop of the crypto market has reduced the probability of a corrective rally.Following a $27 billion drop in valuation in a 24-hour period, the crypto market could require weeks to months of consolidation period before initiating a proper short-term rally. The uncertainty in the market has allowed the crypto market to weaken, Crypto Rand explained, adding that many alternative cryptocurrencies performed relatively well against Bitcoin.“The crypto market still looking weak at this point. Uncertainty I would say is the main feeling right now. As seen by the low volumes everywhere, big traders and investors are still hesitant towards taking big positions given this scenario. One thing I would like to highlight is the response of large market cap cryptocurrencies against this BTC drop. In previous scenarios, all major digital assets were dragged down with BTC or dropping even further. But this time most of them are holding their levels nicely. This is a great precedent for the whole crypto sphere, alternative cryptocurrencies need to set their own path and cycles besides BTC moves.”Throughout the past several months, both large market cap cryptocurrencies and tokens have followed the price trend of BTC. Consequently, tokens have recorded 30 to 60 percent losses against BTC, which recorded a 70 percent drop of its own since January.Given the weakness in the market and the intensity of the daily drops in the price of major cryptocurrencies, Crypto Rand stated that a further drop to the low $5,000 region is inevitable, speaking to Cointelegraph.He added that while the volume of BTC has increased in the past 12 to 24 hours, it is not sufficient to demonstrate a bottomed setup or trigger a corrective rally for a short-term recovery.“In my opinion a further drop is inevitable, with the next strong support and potential bottom in the $4,800 - $5,000 range. Yesterday's volume spike was acceptable but not the characteristic of a bottomed setup (it should be bigger and print a hammer/dragonfly/hanging man doji candle).”DonAlt, a cryptocurrency trader and technical analyst, also stated that if BTC fails to recover swiftly to the $6,000 region, a further drop is likely.“The drop happened, what now? We're pretty much in no man's land, with a lot of open space below us. If we don't manage to rally up to the green line this week I'd expect to go lower.”However, according to Crypto Rand, one positive takeaway from the correction is that cryptocurrencies have started to show independent price movements with less dependence on BTC. In the weeks to come, it is possible that the market sees a decline in the dominance index of BTC, especially if large market cap digital assets begin to perform better.“We will have to wait some more months until BTC settle down its path through a potential reversal, but the alternative cryptocurrency market could take its own direction getting rid of the BTC influence. The big caps altcoin response has been amazing so far. Printing the mentioned dragonfly doji and a notorious spike on volume.”Image Source: CoinMarketCap.comIn the past several hours, Ripple (XRP), Ethereum (ETH), EOS, and Litecoin (LTC) have recorded a 2 to 4 percent increase in price against the US dollar, while BTC remained at around $5,600.In the months to come, possibly throughout the first two quarters of 2019, Bitcoin and the rest of the crypto market could remain in their low price range.Rob Sluymer, a Fundstrat Global Advisors partner, said that the consolidation period of BTC following its 11 percent drop from $6,300 to $5,500 could take weeks to months. Prior to building a platform to initiate a strong mid-term rally, BTC will have to demonstrate stability in the short-term.“This week’s breakdown produced significant technical damage. That will likely take weeks, if not months, to repair to create a durable enough price ‘structure’ to support a multi-month rally.”The analysis of Sluymer echoed that of Willy Woo, the creator of cryptocurrency market data provider Woobull.com, who previously stated that BTC will likely remain in a low price range until the second quarter of 2019.On November 13, before the market demonstrated signs of a major sell-off, Woo stated that technical indicators show a weak short-term trend for BTC.“This last reading of our blockchain and macro market indicators is still in play. What has changed is that NVTS has now broken its support, typically a sell signal.”Based on fundamental indicators like NVT Ratio, an indicator that uses the network activity of the Bitcoin network to obtain an accurate assessment of BTC’s short-term trend, Woo stated that the second quarter of 2019 will likely see BTC bottoming out.“Putting together the blockchain view, I suspect the timing for a bottom may be around Q2 2019. After that we start the true accumulation band, only after that, do we start a long grind upwards.”Currently, many prominent cryptocurrency investors and analysts state that market conditions are poor and the sell pressure on major digital assets remains high. A speedy recovery by BTC and other major cryptocurrencies could be challenging in the short-term, mostly due to the sheer sell-off of the market over the past two days.In an interview with Cointelegraph, Gabor Gurbacs, a digital asset strategist and director at VanEck, said that institutional investors are not concerned whether Bitcoin ends 2018 at $3,000 or $10,000.While the recent market crash has led retail investors and individual traders in the public cryptocurrency exchange market to panic sell and drive the market down further, Gurbacs said that institutional investors are focusing on products that provide investor protection and strengthen the infrastructure of the crypto market.“Large financial institutions are more focused on proper market structure than short term price fluctuations. How do we properly value digital assets? How do we custody digital assets? Are their ETFs available with proper market and investor protections? Most large institutions do not really care if Bitcoin ends 2019 at 3,000 or 10,000. I think market structure is getting better every day and crypto start to look more and more like the commodities and equities markets.”Gurbacs shared the sentiment of BKCM CEO Brian Kelly and Coinshares executive Meltem Dem, stating that the Bitcoin Cash hard fork on November 15 and the hash power war between Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Cash SV contributed to the $27 billion drop of the crypto market.End of the year selling by businesses finalizing their books also played as a catalyst in the market crash Gurbacs added, stating that traditional finance markets like equity and bonds also went through a large correction over the past several months.“Recent market conditions: In the past 3 months (as of 11/15/2018) Bitcoin is down 17.1%, blue chips (MVDA10) – down 17.3% and small caps (MVDASC) – down 25.0%. XRP for the same period is up +47.0%. During the past month, however, Bitcoin and digital assets were fairly stable while the equity and bond markets have gone through a significant correction. The recent turbulence is due to the combination of some systematic end of the year selling (that is businesses are closing their books) and some mess around the Bitcoin Cash fork.”As the Bitcoin Cash hard fork and the hash power conflict amongst Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Bitcoin Cash SV stabilizes, the market is expected to calm down and find its stability and momentum."

People’",https://cointelegraph.com/news/roger-ver-undercover-us-government-agents-go-on-localbitcoins-and-arrest-people,"Former 'Bitcoin Jesus' Roger Ver talks about becoming a Bitcoin Cash 
believer, the future of cryptocurrencies and why the U.S. is the worst ...","Oct 16, 2018",The interview has been edited and condensed.,"Roger Ver is one of the most famous personas in the crypto industry. He calls himself “the first investor into the crypto industry,” being involved with it since 2011. Studying computer science and economics “as a young man” helped him understand the technology behind Bitcoin.“There was absolutely no doubt in my mind that people were going to start using it as money. And like anything, the price is set by supply and demand.“Because the supply of Bitcoin was limited, as more and more people demanded to start using it as money, the price would have to go up and go up a lot.”Roger was seen as the “Bitcoin Jesus,” strongly advocating for the Bitcoin Core philosophy, until November 2017, when he proclaimed that Bitcoin Cash was “the real Bitcoin,” with “bigger market cap, trade volume and user base in the future.”“I am on the exact same side I have always been, which is peer-to-peer electronic cash for the world. And sadly, using a bunch of censorship, propaganda, personal attacks and trolling on the internet, the BTC version of Bitcoin has morphed from having the goal [to] be peer-to-peer electronic cash for the world into being a peer-to-peer science project or store-of-value project.“But I'm someone who wants to enable every individual everywhere on the planet to be able to send or receive money with anyone else instantly, for free and [without the] need [of] permission from anybody else. A peer-to-peer store of value doesn't enable that, Bitcoin Cash does.“If you look at it objectively, Bitcoin Cash is the same version of Bitcoin described in the Bitcoin white paper.“It is the same version of Bitcoin that I got involved with in 2011 and started investing in. I am investing in that because it is the exact same version of Bitcoin that I have been involved in for almost eight years, full time.“And the thing that everyone is calling Bitcoin in the media today — it has the name ‘Bitcoin’ but it doesn't have any of the characteristics that made Bitcoin popular to begin with and it doesn't have most of the entrepreneurs that made Bitcoin popular to begin with.”To watch the interview go here:Catherine Ross: A lot of people considered you the so-called Bitcoin Jesus. Right now, it might look like you have chosen another path. So how would you respond to that?Roger Ver: I think anybody [who] thinks that I've chosen another way should stop [doing it] and look at the situation more deeply. I [have] the exact same speech about Bitcoin that I have been giving since 2011. And that speech that I have been giving since 2011 is still completely true about Bitcoin Cash. It is no longer true about the version of Bitcoin that everyone is calling ‘Bitcoin’ [now].So that means I am promoting the same version of Bitcoin. And the thing that has the ticker symbol ‘BTC,’ it is Bitcoin in [the] name only, its essence is no longer Bitcoin.But in Roger’s opinion, even Bitcoin Cash is not a perfect version of peer-to-peer cash, and there’s “always room to improve anything in the world.”Does that mean we might see some other cryptocurrency overtake Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash?“Maybe. There is a 1,001 [*2,079, at the press time] different cryptocurrencies out there competing for market share. And at the end of the day, that is a good thing.“It's a Darwinian evolution of cryptocurrencies, and at the end of the day, we end up with stronger, more robust, more useful cryptocurrencies for the world to use.“And Bitcoin — BTC — is not guaranteed to be the winner in the end. Neither is Bitcoin Cash. And if something better comes along, [something] that brings more economic freedom to the world and has the ability to give more people more control of their own finances, I will gladly promote that.“I am going to promote whatever I think is the best tool to bring more economic freedom to the world.“Today I think that tool is Bitcoin Cash. But tomorrow, if it [were] something different, I would promote something different.”CR: I saw your recent tweet about regulation. There are a lot of jurisdictions that tend to accept crypto or be very friendly toward blockchain and cryptocurrency ecosystems...RV: New York is not one of them.CR: Do you think the United States has a fair regulatory framework in the space?RV: No, it’s not fair. [The government officials] literally have secret undercover government agents going on LocalBitcoins, trying to buy Bitcoins from people. And when they sell them the Bitcoins, they arrest the people and toss them in jail for years. This is madness! And this needs to [be] stopped.It is madness [that is] happening in the U.S.!Shame on the U.S. for doing that sort of thing! No civilized country would lock people in jail for years for selling Bitcoin to another person who wants to buy it because they didn't get permission from some politician.CR: Do you mean that the U.S. is not suitable for doing business in crypto?RV: Man, you are living on the edge [by] doing business in the U.S. — when it comes to cryptocurrency. You are living dangerously to do so.CR: And where is the most friendly ecosystem in the world [for crypto]?RV: Malta is definitely toward the top of that list — it is not at the very top, [though].[There are] countries that have the most economic freedom around the world — Singapore, Hong Kong, Switzerland, Malta, Cyprus.You are living on the edge [by] doing business in the U.S. — when it comes to cryptocurrency.The U.S. is falling further and further down that list of countries with economic freedom around the world, and it is sad. As someone who is originally from the U.S., it is sad to see that.CR: You’ve been in the industry for almost eight years now, what does the future look like for crypto and blockchain?RV: The future is more and more adoption, more usage, [and] more integration into the society that we live in around the world. And the regulations can only slow it down, but they can't stop it.*The interview took place during the Delta Blockchain Summit in Malta, Oct. 4, 2018Additional editing by Max Yakubowski"

Today’s statement reads that Binance Uganda is also a “first step” to the expansion of crypto exchange markets for a “more inclusive ecosystem that will involve fiat currencies.”According to a previous announcement on Oct. 22, Binance Uganda clients are set to be provided with zero-fee trading until Nov. 24. After that period, Binance Uganda will charge users with 0.1 percent trading fee, the statement says. Today’s statement does not mention the zero-fee trading.Following the announcement, Binance has also announced a recent donation of $500,000 for Uganda through its charity wing, Blockchain Charity Foundation (BCF). The statement says that the launch of the crypto-fiat exchange in the African country is part of the company’s intention to contribute to blockchain development in the country, as well as future plans to expand the technology across the African continent.Binance is currently the top global crypto exchange according to trade volumes that now amount to around $684 million as of press time. The crypto exchange first announced plans to launch a fiat-to-crypto exchange in Uganda in June this year.Also in June, Binance revealed plans to launch a fiat-crypto trading via an independent Malta-based exchange. Following the announcement, Binance signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Malta Stock Exchange’s fintech and digital asset subsidiary, MSX PLC, to launch a new security token digital exchange.Following a warning from Japanese financial regulators, Binance also revealed it will set up a subsidiary office at Malta, a country referred to as the “blockchain island.”More recently, Binance acquired an investment from a subsidiary of Singapore-based governmental investment company Temasek Holdings to support the upcoming launch of a crypto-fiat exchange in Singapore, which was announced in September.In early October, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao announced that the company will give away all listings fees to charity, following users’ allegations about excessive fees for listing altcoins."

The BIS’ general manager Augustín Carstens has likewise previously made a spate of crypto-skeptical remarks, notably characterizing Bitcoin as a “combination of a bubble, a Ponzi scheme and an environmental disaster.”Explicitly recalling Carstens’ characterization, Coeure framed his criticisms of the ten year old innovation with a reference to the aftermath of the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy in fall 2008 – the tipping point for economic turmoil, global recession, and, subsequently, the controversial “too big to fail” rationale for state intervention:“Few remember that Satoshi [Nakamoto, the inventor of Bitcoin] embedded the genesis block with a Times headline from January 2009 about U.K. banks’ bailout. In more ways than one, Bitcoin is the evil spawn of the financial crisis.”After this historical overture, Coeure continued to address international monetary authorities’ present-day pursuit of cryptocurrency tokens and distributed ledger technology (DLT) initiatives. While acknowledging the widespread interest, he claimed that “there is broad agreement that a central bank digital currency, in whatever form, is unlikely to be issued within the next decade.”The ECB official’s stance is at odds with remarks from International Monetary Fund (IMF) managing director Christine Lagarde just yesterday. Speaking at the the Singapore Fintech Festival Nov. 14, Lagarde urged the international community to “consider” endorsing central bank-issued digital currencies (CBDC), arguing they “could satisfy public policy goals,” specifically “financial inclusion.”Coeure’s argument is also directly contrary to that of Stanley Yong, Chief Technical Officer (CTO) of IBM’s Blockchain for Financial Services, and a veteran of Singapore’s central bank, the Monetary Authority of Singapore.Yong stated this week that CBDCs are “the only way” to mitigate the “kinds of risks that came about during the Lehman crisis of 2008,” and could specifically prevent a settlement system freeze – a systemic failure that affected financial systems across multiple countries during the Lehman fallout."

Curiously, all three are known for their negative stance on Bitcoin, with Dimon calling it a “scam,” Banga saying that all non-government-backed cryptos are “junk,” and Ver being hit with allegations of using his platform to mislead people into buying Bitcoin Cash, instead of Bitcoin."

and are solely relying on their expectations of the price of BTC to ...","Nov 2, 2018","Throughout 2018, the cryptocurrency market experienced the fourth worst correction in its nine-year history, as Bitcoin lost more than 69 percent of the value from its all-time high of $19,500.","Despite the substantial decline in the price of Bitcoin (BTC), which heavily affects the earnings of miners, the hash power of the Bitcoin network has continuously increased throughout the past 10 months, from 15 million TH/s to over 50 million TH/s from January to October.As portrayed by the research of blockchain analyst Barclay James, the breakeven cost of mining Bitcoin at 35 million TH/s is around $6,900. The formula employed by James considers the hash power of the Bitcoin network, the hashing power of an ASIC Bitcoin miner, and the efficiency of each miner in producing BTC:# units = global hashing power ÷ unit hashing power ÷ unit efficiencyGiven the cost of Bitcoin mining, when its hash power is currently around 35 million TH/s and the value is $6,400, the breakeven cost of Bitcoin is in the $7,000 to $8,000 range. Which means, at $6,400, Bitcoin miners are losing money by generating BTC and are solely relying on their expectations of the price of BTC to eventually increase in the months to come.For miners outside of China, specifically the mountainous region of Sichuan known to have the cheapest electricity in Asia and a cold climate that naturally cools down cryptocurrency mining equipment, it is even more expensive to mine BTC. The paper of Barclay James reads:“China has some of the world’s cheapest electricity rates as well as average temperatures consistent with temperate regions. This is important as cooling is one of the largest overheads in mining. In addition, the country’s generally low operating costs also give it a competitive advantage. In fact, current estimates place 70 % of global hashing power in China, the majority of which is located in the Sichuan region.”Since June, Bitcoin miners have been mining the dominant cryptocurrency at a significant loss. The fact that the hash power of BTC has continuously risen throughout the bear market of 2018 demonstrates large activity in the global cryptocurrency mining sector and the confidence of miners that the industry will recover as the year comes to an end.BitMEX Research, a cryptocurrency firm that operates as a research subsidiary of major digital asset exchange BitMEX, disclosed in its paper in August that Bitmain, the dominant conglomerate in the cryptocurrency mining sector, has been deliberately selling its latest Bitcoin ASIC miner Antminer S9 at a lower price.In 2017, Bitmain sold more than one million Antminer S9 miners and another 700,000 of them in the first quarter of 2018. According to the researchers, who calculated the disclosed gross profit margin of Bitmain in 2017 and the implied cost of each miner. Bitmain has set a negative profit margin of 11.6 percent for the Antminer S9, its main product.The researchers stated that the distribution of Antminer S9 miners at such a low profit margin and the sudden increase in the sale of the miner in the first quarter of 2018 suggest the company employed a strategy to outsell its competition by underpricing its products.“These low prices are likely to be a deliberate strategy by Bitmain, to squeeze out their competition by causing them to experience lower sales and therefore financial difficulties. In our view, herein lies the key to one of the main driving forces behind the decision to IPO. A successful IPO may increase the firepower available to continue this strategy and eliminate an advantage rivals could have by doing their IPOs first.”The paper also proposed that the company may simply have too many Antminer S9 miners in its inventory.In June 2018, Bitmain was criticized for shipping Antminer S9 miners caked with dust. Some miners alleged the firm of sending old or used ASIC miners. In response to this, Bitmain stated that all traders who received defective or affected Antminer S9 miners would be fully compensated.“Any product can be imperfect, and there will be shortcomings in the process of enterprise development. We have also compensated the miners who have received mining equipment with inadequate computing power and the mining equipment are now being run properly.”Whether the decision of the firm to sell its main ASIC miner with a low profit margin was to due to its competition or to clear its inventory, the end result was the distribution of an increased number of efficient and high performance ASIC miners to the global mining sector, which ultimately led to the increase in the hash power of the Bitcoin network.In the first quarter of 2018, Bitmain generated twice the profit of Nvidia, the world’s largest graphics card manufacturer. Nvidia generated $550 million in pure profit while Bitmain recorded $1.1 billion in profit from January to March.The lucrative business model of Bitmain and its high profits led GMO and Samsung, two of the most influential technology conglomerates in Japan and South Korea, to enter the global cryptocurrency mining industry.GMO introduced its own ASIC miner with competitive specifications in comparison to Bitmain’s Antminer S9. Samsung Electronics has allocated a portion of its foundry in Suwon, South Korea, to manufacture cryptocurrency ASIC miners, in partnership with emerging companies in the mining sector.When Samsung Electronics first announced its decision to target the global cryptocurrency mining industry, it emphasized that it remains unsure whether it can improve the company’s revenues in general. But, the emphasis of the establishment on its mining venture was to engage in an emerging industry like crypto, given that it has successfully penetrated into insurance, fintech, electronics manufacturing, car making, and ship building in the past several decades. Samsung Securities analyst, Hwang Min-seong, said in January of this year:“Samsung Electronics could increase its revenues through ASIC chip manufacturing but because the foundry only accounts for a small portion of the company’s semiconductor manufacturing plant, it is difficult to predict that the firm’s mining venture will have a significant impact on the company’s revenues.” Since then, Samsung has aggressively expanded its mining businesses, seeing an increased demand in the market. The uncertainty of Samsung towards cryptocurrency mining demonstrated the firm’s unwillingness to commit to the industry unless the company sees significant potential in both the short-term and long-term growth of the market.Most recently, Samsung signed a deal with Squire, a Canada-based crypto mining corporation that raised $19.5 million in August to develop cryptocurrency mining equipment, to manufacture ASIC miners on behalf of the Canadian firm.Around a similar period, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), the world’s largest independent chipmaker, slashed the growth target of the cryptocurrency mining sector from 9 percent to 6.5 percent.The conglomerate stated that the weakening of the demand for cryptocurrency mining led the firm to decrease the growth target of the industry. But, it remains unclear whether the report is exclusive to Bitmain, given that TSMC is the manufacturer of Bitmain’s ASIC miners, or to the rest of the industry.“However, our business is also negatively impacted by further weakening of cryptocurrency mining demand. As a result, we estimate our 2018 growth rate will be about 6.5% in U.S. dollar term, which is close to the foundry industry’s growth but slightly below our 7% to 9% guidance given in the last conference.”Despite the conflicting viewpoints of Samsung and TSMC toward the demand for cryptocurrency mining, in the past several days, two multi-million dollar mining facilities have opened in Armenia and Colorado.Local publications in Armenia reported that a new $50 million digital asset mining facility was opened on October 19 with 3,000 ASIC miners to mine Bitcoin and Ethereum. In the upcoming months, 120,000 ASIC miners are expected to be added to the facility.It was local real estate firm Multi Group Concern (MGT) and Malta-based technology company Omnia Tech International Company which created the facility with the support of the government and local authorities.The plan to build the facility was originally released in April, when Omnia Tech founder, Robert Velghe, said that the two companies intend to invest more than $2 billion in mining and crypto-related businesses in Armenia.“We will also help Omnia Tech with the establishment of the Financial Technology Park and the data exchange center in Armenia. We intend to create here a blockchain-based center for the development of new information projects, which will turn Armenia into a high-tech platform.”On October 25, MGT, the largest mining facility operator in the U.S., announced that it will establish another large-scale mining facility in Colorado equipped with 6,300 Bitmain S9 miners. Already, MGT operates 6,800 Bitmain S9 miners and 50 GPU Ethereum mining rigs in the country.MGT COO Stephen Schaeffer emphasized that despite the decline in the price of Bitcoin, the company intends to “run into the burning building” to find opportunities, which in this case is to mine BTC.Many of the world’s largest economies are in the process of implementing practical regulatory frameworks to facilitate the growth of mining companies. Authorities in South Korea, Japan, and the U.S. have welcomed mining facilities to operate with low-cost energy. Countries with ambiguous cryptocurrency regulations such as China and Russia have also demonstrated a neutral stance towards mining.Throughout the past 15 months, China has banned virtually every business and activity related to the cryptocurrency sector including trading, events, and over-the-counter (OTC) investment. However, it has opened two use cases of cryptocurrencies: processing transactions and mining digital assets.Several regional governments in Russia have also opened up to cryptocurrency mining, leading various initiatives to convince major mining companies to launch mining farms in the country.In August, Deputy Governor of the Leningrad Region, Dmitry Yalo, said at the opening of a new mining facility in Russia that the region intends to lure in more mining centers in the years to come with low electricity prices, qualified personnel, and a naturally cold climate to cool down ASIC miners with no additional costs.The conflict between the U.S. and China began to affect chip makers and mining equipment manufacturers based in China, including Bitmain. The 27.6 percent tariffs on the Antminer S9 has made it significantly more expensive for buyers outside Asia to purchase the miner.Previously, Bitmain was able to ship Antminer S9 miners with no tariffs as the product was classified as a data processing machine. The sudden imposition of tariffs against electrical machinery apparatus, which includes data processing machines, has created an inefficient ecosystem for China’s ASIC manufacturers.The imposition of tariffs by the US against China comes in a period in which U.S. President Donald Trump has expressed concerns about the lack of reciprocity between the two countries. For many years, China has been able to ship products to the U.S. with near-zero tax and fee, thus, Amazon’s Vice President of Global Policy Paul Misener said once:“The cost to ship a one-pound package from South Carolina to New York City would run nearly $6; from Beijing to NYC: $3.66.”South Korea and Japan remain unaffected by the tariffs, and with practical regulatory frameworks established by both countries, Samsung and GMO are expected to continue their successful run in the global mining sector.As of current, despite the significant drop in the price of major cryptocurrencies, the demand for cryptocurrency mining remains relatively high as seen in the rise in the hash rate of the Bitcoin network and the expansion of Samsung, GMO, and Bitmain’s operations.Major regions have established positive regulatory frameworks towards cryptocurrency miners and companies, which could lead to the increase in the establishment of mining facilities by investors that foresee a substantial surge in the valuation of the crypto market in the mid-term."

in the country, after two men installing a Bitcoin ATM were arrested.","Oct 26, 2018","The head of an Indian nonprofit trade organization said cryptocurrency is “illegal,” and urged businesses to obey the law, local news daily the Hindu reported Thursday, Oct. 25.","Debjani Ghosh, the president of the National Association of Software and Services Companies (NASSCOM), was cited by the Hindu saying that cryptocurrencies are illegal from NASSCOM’s perspective. NASSCOM is a nonprofit trade association of over 2,000 member companies for the Indian IT and business process outsourcing industries.“It is [the] law of the land and hence, we have to work with it,” Ghosh claimed about cryptocurrency’s ‘illegal’ status. She added, “If we do not agree, we have to go back to the government and speak about why cryptocurrencies aren’t correct.” However, Ghosh noted that the “illegal” status of crypto is the result of the government’s failure to keep up with innovation:“The genesis of this problem, however, lies in the failure of policy making not keeping pace with rapid technological changes. NASSCOM’s focus would be to say, how do you synergize technological development and policy making. I think that will be our focus.”Cryptocurrency is currently legal in India, but in July the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) banned the country’s banks from servicing businesses involved in exchanging or processing digital assets. At the time, RBI cited risks to financial stability and the security of investors as being the main reasons behind the ban.Following the crackdown, commentators were quick to note that, while banking activities for crypto business were suspended, it was not a ban on crypto in India outright. The country’s supreme court continues to uphold the ban even after hearing a raft of petitions.Since July, the ban has had severe repercussions for the industry. Exchanges in particular have faced difficult conditions, with major platform Zebpay halting operations and relocating to crypto-friendly Malta.Ghosh’s comments come after police clamped down this week on a project from crypto exchange Unocoin, arresting its co-founders after they installed a Bitcoin ATM in a Bangalore shopping mall.Various media outlets have cited authorities who reportedly explained that the ATM “had not taken any permission from the state government and is dealing in cryptocurrency outside the remit of the law.” According to a police official quoted by the Times of India, the central bank considers cryptocurrency “illegal.”"

And when that bubble burst, it collapsed — collapsed from $20,000 ...","Oct 15, 2018",The interview has been edited and condensed.,"Nouriel Roubini is a New York-based economist that famously predicted the 2008 financial crisis when only a few considered there might be a threat to the existing course of events at the time.A Harvard alumnus and now a professor at NYU Stern School of Business, Mr. Roubini has always been critical of the crypto and blockchain industry. Oct.11, 2018 he testified at the Congressional hearing on Capitol Hill, Washington D.C., warning U.S. senators about “the mother or father of all scams and bubbles,"" — crypto.We met with Mr. Roubini during BlockShow Americas in Las Vegas and talked about why he doesn’t believe in smart contracts, thinks Ethereum is a scam, and the fact that he might want to give the industry another try.“I'm not against [it], I'm open to any type of innovation, but I'm an expert on financial crises and asset bubbles. And I became famous [by] predicting the global financial crisis  — the burst of that bubble.I can see a bubble when there is one — and to me, this entire space has been the mother and the father of all financial bubbles and now it’s [going to] burst.Last year, almost everybody I knew was asking me every other day, “Should I buy Bitcoin?”And the price of Bitcoin doubled, tripled, quadrupled, and went to $20,000. And when that bubble burst, it collapsed — collapsed from $20,000 down to $6,000 today (at the time of the interview).If you bought it at the peak, you lost 70 percent of your value. And it's typical of all these financial bubbles: They go up until they collapse. And Bitcoin is actually the best [example], because the average cryptocurrency has lost, in the last nine months, more than 90 percent of their value.I spoke about the bubble existing and this bubble going bust. And guess what? In the last year, [it] has gone bust. So I think I've been vindicated and proven right.Bitcoin could go to the moon or zero, I'm not going to make a penny either way because I'm neither short or long. And I'm just an academic that speaks his mind. And I saw a big bubble, and I think that it's fair as an intellectual to discuss these things and then figure out what's going wrong.”To watch the interview go here:“An academic study suggests that 81 percent of all ICOs were a scam to begin with; 11 percent of them have failed or have died; and of the remaining eight percent that is traded on exchanges, the top 10 have lost on average, in the last year, 95 percent of their value — more than Bitcoin.So, there was a bubble — and everybody was riding the bubble, everybody was issuing an ICO, raising money — but now it's gone bust.I think that they've lost already 95 percent of their value and they could lose another 95 percent.I would say 99 percent of cryptocurrencies are worth zero. Just because some people believe in something alternative to fiat currencies — alternative to gold — then, like collectibles, some people are going to hold some Bitcoin. Bitcoin is not going to disappear. But, you know, Ethereum is a bubble and it’s a bit of a scam — it's worth nothing — XRP, all the other ones, they’re all going bust.”It’s a scam because the technology. They talk about smart contracts — there's nothing about them that is smart, they’re all buggy. They’re not real contracts because you have to enforce certain contracts, you cannot have just the code.They've tried things that have failed: Their DAO was a failure.You know, there's a lot of people [who] talk about their DApps or their distributed apps. 75 percent of those apps are what? CryptoKitties, Ponzi schemes and other pyramid schemes, and other casino games, like Las Vegas. So, after a decade, what does Ethereum have to show us? CryptoKitties and Ponzi schemes? And that's what they're doing? They're not doing anything that is of any use to anybody.CR: But if a smart contract is a technology, — and you said “it's buggy” — technology can be buggy and it can be fixed. Don't you think we need more time to see the technology rise and smart contracts working better?NR: I don't believe, first of all, in smart contracts. By definition, any contract has to be enforced by lawyers — [there is nothing that is enforced] by itself. So, the idea that you put everything in a code in a contract is silly to begin with. And, you know, a typical other program has less than one percent of bugs in its code, and a typical smart contract has 10 percent of its code  is buggy [sic].I mean, this is the reality where we are in now.And by the way, the broader question about cryptocurrency is that they are not scalable, and there's no system that makes them scalable; they're not decentralized because the entire system is [becoming] centralized; and they are not secure because there are so many ways to hack them.So, it doesn't have any functions [it] should have: It's not scalable, it's not secure, it's not decentralized. So, what is it worth for? With Bitcoin, you can do five transactions per second; with Visa, you can do 25,000 transactions per second.They've [the blockchain community] been saying for a decade, “We are going to resolve it with proof-of-stake rather than proof-of-work.” It has not worked yet. And even if there was something scalable, it’s going to be centralized and therefore is not secure. So, there's a fundamental flaw in the technology.At least financial systems that we know are centralized, yes, but they're secure and they're scalable.  They've been talking about fixing it, but Vitalik Buterin, who is the creator of Ethereum, said you cannot have a blockchain system that has three characteristic of the same time: being scalable, decentralized, and secure.CR: Even after the 2008 global financial crisis, you still believe in the traditional financial banking system?Traditional financial systems are centralized —  and there's nothing wrong with institutional centralizing in my view. They [the blockchain community] criticize it, saying “We want it decentralized.”But I prefer a centralized system with a trusted authority — but at least they're secure and scalable.There's a lot of talk about decentralization: Miners are centralized as an oligopoly, coders are centralized, exchanges are centralized — as 99 percent of all transactions occur on a centralized exchange — and there's a massive concentration of wealth. This is worse than North Korea in terms of income and wealth inequality.The reality is just the opposite: It's a totally centralized system.[At the same time] there are many problems with the traditional financial systems. And I’ve been one of the biggest critics of the financial system. And I believe that there are ways to [democratize] finance and [to] make it more efficient, but this is not based on blockchain.There is a revolution in financial services: It's called fintech and it has zero to do with cryptocurrency and  blockchain.It’s based on AI, machine learning, Internet of Things and big data. It’s revolutionizing payment system, insurance, credit allocation, capital market functions, and asset management.Take, for example, payment systems: There [are] already plenty of digital payment systems — that do billions of transactions a day, and are used by billions of people around the world — that are not based on blockchain. In China, you have AliPay and WeChat Pay; in India, you have all these UPI systems; in Africa, you have M-Pesa; in the United States, you have Venmo, PayPal, Square — and so on, and so on. These are useful transactions.With these models, you can do millions of transactions — and there are billions of transactions done by billions of people today. They are digital payment systems based on [the] traditional financial institution and fintech. They have nothing to do with blockchain. We don’t need blockchain, we don't need crypto to [democratize] finance.There is already a revolution: there’s going to be much more competition, there’ll be much more access. If you are a poor farmer in Kenya today, you are using M-Pesa. On your little smartphone, you can make transactions, you can borrow and lend, you can buy and sell your goods and services, you have a whole slew of financial services without the brick-and-mortar bank. And all these things are available to billions of poor people in Africa. What [do] they have to do with blockchain or crypto? Nothing, zero. So, there is a revolution and it has nothing to do with blockchain.CR: The entire philosophy of the industry was to create a transparent system and create a new world from a financial system that you can trust, a financial system that thinks about a user, a client. So you think it failed to do what it was supposed to do?NR: Of course, it completely failed: After 10 years, there is no killer app; the crypto assets are going bust; they’ve lost 99 percent of their value; all these experiments have led not a single corporation or single financial institution using this technology; and there is no reason why they want to use this technology. And why would you want [to]?Why would I want to trust somebody in Russia or China to verify my transactions? It’s not safe. Why would I want to do it? There are central banks, there are corporations, there are institutions that have been existing forever that are based on trust — on the reputation. And I know what I’m dealing with.I'd rather have those institutions verify my transaction rather than somebody in China who can manipulate everything I am doing. Why should I trust somebody while I don't even know what the name is, who they are, what they do.CR: So, you would rather trust a bank? How can you be sure that your money is safe?NR: We have security laws. If a bank manipulates, there’ve been hundreds of billions of dollars in fines on the banks and their misbehavior — people ended up in jail. There are lots of problems with the traditional financial system: Blockchain and cryptocurrency do not resolve this problem. Fintech resolves it, but fintech has nothing to do with blockchain or cryptocurrencies.I'm the first one who criticized the financial system, I've been writing about financial crises, I've been criticizing [the] banking system. I don't believe that crypto or blockchain resolves any, any of the problems of our existing financial system, [and they] don't resolve anything.It's just something for a bunch of self-serving people speaking about decentralization, speaking about freedom, speaking about [the] democratization of finance — and there is no democratization of finance, there is no more access to financial services through crypto or blockchain. There are other alternatives that exist out there, like M-Pesa, that are giving power and giving democratization of finance to billions of people in Africa. Those things have nothing to do with blockchain. I believe in those things.I don't believe in blockchain.CR: I see your point of view, but just to be clear, the banking system has been around for centuries, right? So, maybe you should give the crypto industry and blockchain industries a try?NR: No. I'm not giving it a try. I'm gonna give a try to financial innovation that changes the financial system.All those things [mentioned above] —  they are revolutionizing finance, they are leading to competition, they are forcing the banking system to innovate or not survive, and they are changing the world. But they have nothing to do with blockchain. Why should I give the benefit of the doubt to something that has not provided any application which is used by anybody. I don't believe in it and the proof is in the pudding.CR: My last question is, have you ever tried trading cryptocurrency?NR: I haven’t tried it. Some people say, “Oh, you are critical of crypto because you are shorting Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies.” I have zero position — I have no long position, no short position.I may be right or may be wrong, but crypto could go to the moon to go to zero; I'm not going to make a penny out of it. I'm an intellectual. I'm an academic. I have no conflicts of interest.My only thing is my own academic reputation. If I’m proven wrong, my reputation is going to be negatively affected. But I'm not going to make a penny. And therefore, I'm not going to take a position one way or another because if I take a position, I have a financial interest to talk down or up a particular cryptocurrency; and that's not my interest.I'm an intellectual and I'm not going to make money —  one way or another — out of it."

Despite a short-lived spike Oct. 17, which correlated with Tether’s price drop, Bitcoin has retracted back to just a price point just slightly higher than at the start of its weekly chart.In a longer view, the top coin is seeing notably low volatility levels: earlier this month, Bitcoin achieved a 17-month low volatility rate, recording its highest level of stability since mid-2017.Data from Bitcoinity shows a consistent decline in Bitcoin’s volatility, calculated as an averaged standard deviation from all market trades throughout 2018:Bitcoin Price volatility, 10 Oct. 2016-10 Oct. 2018.

The asset is down just under 1 percent on the day to trade at $0.46 at press time. Nonetheless, Ripple has seen more momentum than its larger market cap counterparts: it is up a solid 13 percent on its weekly chart.

Several reasons have been proposed to explain the recent wave of negative market sentiment for Tether, including recent reports that banking complications appear to have beset both Tether and associated crypto exchange Bitfinex.These reports were followed by Bitfinex temporarily suspending fiat wire deposits without disclosing a specific reason.Others have proposed the apparent sell-off was tied to investors “losing faith” because of the ongoing lack of transparency surrounding Tether’s claims to be backed one-to-one by the U.S. dollar. During its tumble, Tether traded as low as $0.925 on Oct. 15.Tether’s market cap is also down today, around 2.1 billion by press time, as opposed to about 2.7 billion last month.Tether 7-day price chart.

Prominent venture capital investor Garry Tan has argued that what he dubs the “crypto winter […] makes it safer for super-long-term oriented Yale-model institutions to enter at a price that isn’t dangerous.”Others consider that volatility will continue to decline as a sign of market maturity, yet as a Cointelegraph analysis piece has this week outlined, the coin has a historical pattern of seeing periods of stability followed by a significant rally, as in 2013."

China, the government will again try to put a lid on it.” Wesse's 
predictions ...","Nov 4, 2018","In the aftermath of September 2017’s historic ban on initial coin offerings (ICOs), and the banishment of domestic crypto trading platforms, a resourceful crypto community was already showing signs of devising multiple means of circumventing the authorities’ increasingly draconian actions.","Part two of Cointelegraph’s three-part series continues to investigate the factors that catapulted China’s regulators to redouble their efforts to curb the meteoric rise of crypto trades; their unprecedented actions to try to cut the country’s crypto mining titans down to size; the response of China’s tech triumvirate — Alibaba, Tencent, and Baidu — to new constraints; and as ever, the proliferating means investors continue to use to scale an “impregnable” anti-crypto wall.In December 2017, Leonhard Weese, president of the Bitcoin Association of Hong Kong had observed: China’s “authorities are more worried about the narrative, rather than what people actually do. Once it gets widely reported that Bitcoin trading is well and alive in China, the government will again try to put a lid on it.”Wesse’s predictions were sound: as early as January 4, local reports revealed that financial regulators had frozen an unknown number of OTC trade accounts country-wide. The combined value of those frozen in the southern cities of Shenzhen and Guangzhou was said to be over 300 million yuan ($46.1 million at the time); around thirty further accounts were said to have been frozen in the northern province of Hebei.Sources further indicated that a policy to curb the country’s thriving Bitcoin mining industry was in the works. Due to the country’s abundance of cheap energy and hardware, early 2017 reports showed that over two-thirds of global mining pools were based in China.Mining behemoths, such as Beijing-born Bitmain, not only benefited from the power glut in coal-rich regions such as Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia, but were reportedly being cut bespoke deals by local government. In Mongolia’s Ordos city, authorities were said to be offering Bitmain a subsidized electricity rate of just four U.S. cents per kilowatt hour — 30 percent cheaper than the going rate for other local industrial firms.On January 2, a leaked memo from the PBoC to a top-level government internet finance group — the Leading Group of Internet Financial Risks Remediation — reportedly proposed that Bitcoin miners should make an “orderly exit” from China due to them consuming “huge amounts of resources and stoking speculation of virtual currencies.”The ties between the central bank and the internet-finance regulator were said to be close, given that a deputy PBoC governor, Pan Gongsheng, had been instated as head of the regulatory group when it had first been established back in 2016. Pan was not the most crypto-receptive of figures: he was said to have predicted the death of Bitcoin in December 2017, and was quoted by Chinese media that same month as saying that:“If we had not shut down Bitcoin exchanges and cracked down on ICOs several months ago, if China still accounted for more than 80% of the world’s Bitcoin trading and ICO fundraising, everyone, what would happen today? Thinking of this question makes me scared.”Returning to the leaked Bitcoin miner memo, Quartz reported that the internet-finance regulator subsequently ordered local authorities to wield all available means in their arsenal — including “measures linked to electricity prices, land use, tax, and environmental protection” — to pressure miners to cease their operations.At a national level, the regulator is reported to have requested local authorities to submit a progress report by January 10, detailing the existing mining facilities in their jurisdictions, followed by monthly reports on the progress of miners’ “exits” on the 10th of each month.A separate leaked document from the regulator’s regional Xinjiang office is alleged to have ordered authorities in western China to submit similar reports, citing near-identical concerns. Quartz’ enquiries with the Xinjiang office at the time confirmed the authenticity of the latter, regional document.In parallel, Bloomberg reported on a “closed-door meeting” said to have been held by the PBoC at the end of December 2017, allegedly outlining a plan to direct a wider spectrum of local officials and national regulators to monitor — and even potentially restrict — high energy consumption associated with the mining industry.Anonymous sources had told the media that Chinese officials were “concerned” that miners were “taking advantage” of cheap electricity sources in certain regions. Bloomberg noted, however, that Caixin news agency had refuted that the PBoC meeting had taken place, citing an undisclosed source.On January 13, China’s Economic Observer (EEO) reported on the unfolding consequences and responses to the government’s “tightened” approach to mining.Officials from the relevant authorities in China’s eastern provinces of Shandong and Jiangsu observed that the regulatory pressure had been uneven with respect to different geographic regions: they claimed not to have received any notices, and considered that the “clean-up” was focused on the country’s central and western regions.Seemingly uneven pressure was consistent with news of a national effort to transfer power away from energy-rich but sparsely-populated regions to where it was needed most. Virtually all the lines in China’s new ultra-high-voltage transmission network — designed to redirect electricity from the oversupplied north and west to the east — were set to be completed that year.Lauri Myllyvirta, a Beijing-based campaigner with Greenpeace, said she considered that Bitcoin mining in China at the time was “mainly an opportunistic way of making some money out of the failures and inefficiencies of the power system.”EEO cited “a person familiar with the matter” as saying that this fact had not gone unnoticed, and that regulation of Bitcoin mining pools had in fact “entered the regulatory horizon as early as the September 2017 ICO policy.”As a consequence of the intensified pressure, several mines in the southwestern Sichuan province — where mining activity is said to have been concentrated — had now entered a “period of downtime” pending regulatory clarification. The Leading Group of Internet Financial Risks Remediation is reported to have been undertaking an “inventory” of mining activities across the province.EEO also noted that some large mining pools were beginning to relocate their operations overseas; for small-medium sized pools, however, the cost of overseas transition was said to be “too difficult to bear,” as corroborated by one small mining pool owner.On January 11, ViaBTC, reportedly the world's fourth largest Bitcoin mining pool at the time, issued a statement that it would be increasing its cloud mining maintenance fee:""Due to recent policy changes, some of our long-term hosting partners are facing a crisis of closure as mining resources in Mainland China become more scarce, leading to rocketing costs of our cloud mining operation.""In parallel, “three independent sources” revealed that local authorities had frozen assets totalling over 600 million yuan in bank accounts that were found to be investing in crypto mining firms in the provinces of Hunan, Heilongjiang, Hebei, and Guangdong.As it redoubled efforts to purge the economy of perceived risks, Beijing looked set to escalate its ban on crypto trading to include “market-making” platforms, the definition of which was not — at the outset — clearly delineated. As early as the previous September, reports had already indicated that the government would be looking to extend its ban beyond domestic exchanges and clamp down on Chinese mainland access to foreign exchange sites.On January 15, Bloomberg cited undisclosed sources that claimed the authorities would indeed try to “block domestic access to homegrown and offshore platforms that enable centralized trading,” without defining exactly ”how policy makers [would] define such platforms.”Despite September’s domestic exchange closures, analyses in January continued to include Bitcoin trading as a factor in capital outflows from China: an article January 6 suggested that the government’s capital-control measures — which included subjecting yuan conversions to a quota — only further incentivized crypto trades. Shanghai-based economist Qiu Difan noted that:“Under [China’s] regulations on cross-border flows, the appeal of using Bitcoin to obtain foreign exchange and take capital out of the country will increase, especially for funds that may have been used in illegal operations such as money laundering.”Thomas Glucksmann, head of marketing at Hong Kong-based over-the-counter (OTC) crypto trading desk Gatecoin, considered that “lackluster equity performance, a potential real-estate bubble, yuan weakness, and capital controls are all driving Chinese demand for Bitcoin.”With an intensified crypto clampdown imminent, BTCC CEO Bobby Lee presciently noted that the government’s intent to reduce trading by shuttering crypto exchanges would be a Pyrrhic victory: “they can’t crack on Bitcoin itself,” he said. In response to restrictions, “the desire will just go underground, and when the desire goes underground, it’s out of control.”This seemed to be corroborated by domestic traders: in the words of one anonymous Chinese crypto investor:“I can do over-the-counter trades or I’ll go offshore… my wallet is my wallet. I’ve never registered my identification card.”Over 15 domestic crypto exchanges had been shut by that time.On January 17, the PBoC issued an internal circular to financial institutions, tightening the noose on any residual provision of banking or funding services to crypto-related activities:“Every bank and branch must carry out self-inspection and rectification, starting from today. Service[s] for cryptocurrency trading [are] strictly prohibited. Effective measures should be adopted to prevent payment channels from being used for cryptocurrency settlement.”The central bank added that “banks should enhance their daily transaction monitoring, and the timely shut down of payment channels as soon as they discover any suspected trading of cryptocurrencies.” A deadline for the disclosing the implementation of such measures was set for January 20.On January 26, the semi-official National Internet Finance Association of China issued a risk alert to investors emphasizing that “offshore crypto-trading platforms pose the same hidden dangers of systemic risks, market manipulation, and money laundering.”By February 5, the Financial News — an official PBoC-affiliated publication — stated that:“To prevent financial risks, China will step up measures to remove any onshore or offshore platforms related to virtual currency trading or ICOs.”The article acknowledged the limitations of the efficacy of the 2017 domestic crypto exchange ban, stating that:“ICOs and virtual currency trading did not completely withdraw from China following the official ban after the closure of the domestic virtual currency exchanges, many people [have] turned to overseas platforms to continue participating in virtual currency transactions. Overseas transactions and regulatory evasion have resumed risks are still there, fuelled by illegal issuance, and even fraud and pyramid schemes.”An interview with the PBoC confirmed the central bank was set to toughen its restrictions on domestic access to overseas platforms.Donald Zhao, a Bitcoin trader who had left the stifling regulatory climate of Beijing for Tokyo in the wake of the September ban, commented:“I think the new move literally means it would be even harder to circumvent the ban in China. People promoting related business programmes may be arrested.”He added that using VPNs (virtual private networks) to trade crypto on formerly domestic crypto exchanges that had relocated offshore was at that time “common” among Chinese traders. This, despite the fact that Beijing had ordered China’s three telecoms companies to completely block citizens’ access to VPNs by February 2018.China’s notorious Great Firewall — the country’s web surveillance and content-control system designed to prevent residents from accessing restricted sites — remained porous, despite the MIIT’s campaign to “clean-up” internet access services, making it illegal to operate a VPN service without government approval.Beijing’s online sweep was immediately palpable; when “Bitcoin,” “virtual currency,” and “ICOs” were entered into Chinese search-engine Baidu and social media platform Weibo, no obvious paid sponsored content came up alongside the expected results.On March 6, the Chinese government was reported to have shut down multiple crypto exchange WeChat accounts — including that of OKEx.On March 9, PBoC governor Zhou Xiaochuan broadcast once again the official stance towards crypto, frankly declaring that:“We do not currently recognize Bitcoin and other digital currencies as a tool like paper money, coins, and credit cards for retail payments.”He added that while the development of digital currency was a “technological inevitability,” and would ultimately diminish cash circulation, the central bank was not rushing to issue a national digital currency. He emphasized that the PBoC continued to marshal its efforts to “prevent substantial and irreparable damages” to the domestic economy.Then, on March 19, the “unexpected” appointment of a new PBoC governor, Yi Gang — a figure who was reported to have made positive remarks about Bitcoin — led some to speculate that the central bank might be poised to soften its stance towards decentralized cryptocurrencies.Back in 2013, Yi was said to have conceded that while Bitcoin could not be legally recognized by the central bank, “ordinary people [had] the freedom to participate.” He considered the coin to be “innovative and inspiring”, predicting it would remain a subject of public attention in the long term.Yi — just as President Xi Jinping — was both pro-market and pro-market reform, having consistently emphasized the importance of market liberalization, and invited economists who could support his long-term plan to increase the flexibility of the Chinese market. Within weeks, the new governor had made the unprecedented move to officially open the gates of China’s $27 trillion payments market to foreign companies.In the wake of Yi’s appointment, Cointelegraph reported on an opinion piece dating back to September 17, which had argued that the president’s restrictions on crypto exchanges had been little more than a political move to appease hardline Communist Party members ahead of the October 17 elections. Blogger Jon Creasy had proposed:“My prediction is this; as soon as President Xi Jinping is re-elected  —  and he will be  —  conservative, free(er)-trade legislation will be put in place, and Bitcoin exchanges will be reinstated:But for now, Mr. Xi must appeal to the people who keep him in power: the Communist Party. In my opinion, banning Bitcoin exchanges is nothing short of temporary glad-handing.”By early May, once again the Chinese media was focused on the “overseas” afterlife of its domestic crypto exchange titans. The National Radio’s (CNR) “Voice of China” reported that investors had alleged that OKEx was continuing to “illegally” work in China with domestic clients.As part of a radio series devoted to “revealing the secret behind digital currencies,” the channel interviewed an OKEx investor who claimed that OKEx was still operating in Beijing for “almost exclusively” Chinese users and that the exchange had moved its headquarters to Belize and the team to Hong Kong in name only.The report also noted that OKEx’s p2p platform enabled consumers to purchase crypto using their Alipay or Wechat accounts, flaunting the ban on transacting between crypto and fiat.Yet a week later, on May 11, the government made the surprise announcement that it would begin to issue a monthly “independent analysis” of cryptocurrency and blockchain projects, overseen by an MIIT department, the China Electronic Information Industry Development (CCID). The government gave the impetus for the project as being what it considered to be a “lack of a completely independent assessment/rating” system for digital assets, stating that:“The project demonstrates the confidence of the Chinese government in the technology, and will act as a guide for government, enterprise, and research institutes.”The rankings, dubbed the “Global Public Chain Assessment Index,” were set to cover 28 cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Monero, NEO, QTUM, Ripple, and Zcash, to name but a few.  When published, the first iteration of the new Index crowned Ethereum in first place, followed by Steem, Lisk, NEO, and Komodo. Bitcoin was placed 13th. On the basis of three parameters — “technology,” “application,” and “innovation” — Bitcoin had been found lacking in the former two, even as it outflanked — perhaps unsurprisingly — all other cryptocurrencies on the innovation frontThat same month, on May 18, the government launched an educational initiative, publishing the results of an MIIT-led study that claimed to have detected 421 “fake” cryptocurrencies. The MIIT had established a national committee of internet financial security experts (ICFERT) to identify the key features of fraudulent digital currency profiles. They found three:First, reliance on a “pyramid scheme” model, in which investors are first compelled to make a payment, and then promised returns on the basis that they enroll others in the scheme.Second, the absence of open-source code for the fake digital asset, allowing its creators to dupe investors into an illusion of skyrocketing growth by artificially splitting the tokens to create an impression of proliferating rewards. The fraudsters claim that the more tokens are generated, the more wealth increases, “only rising without falling.”Third, given that bogus coins cannot be traded on legitimate crypto exchanges, they are largely traded through OTC deals, or even on transient phony platforms. With no transparency, scammers can manipulate apparent price surges, while at the same time preventing investors from withdrawing funds in order to benefit from such “spikes.”By early July, the PBoC released a report claiming that the yuan now accounted for less than one percent of global Bitcoin transactions, extolling the momentous impact of policy restrictions.It went on to celebrate the fact that the country’s policies had ensured a “zero-risk” exit for the 88 cryptocurrency exchanges and 85 ICO trading platforms closed since late 2017.Guo Dazhi, research director at the Zhongguancun Internet Finance Institute, commented:“This indicates that the policy has been very successful. It is within expectations that the yuan’s share in global Bitcoin transactions would drop after China announced the ban.”Despite PBoC apparently lauding the success of its measures, this summer saw intensified attempts to strike a fatal blow on China’s cryptocurrency traders.On August 7, the Cyberspace Administration of China issued new regulations stipulating that content providers within chat apps were required to comply with “national interests” and “public orders.”The impact on the crypto space was almost immediately felt. By August 21, Tencent’s WeChat — which had over 1 billion users — was reported to have blocked a number of crypto- and blockchain-related accounts.A WeChat official clarified that some public accounts were suspected of publishing ICO and crypto trading “hype,” in violation of the service’s “Interim Provisions on the Development of Public Information Services for Instant Messaging Tools” terms — as had just been outlined in the Cyberspace Administration’s new rules.Deepchain, Huobi News, Node Capital-backed Jingse Caijing, and CoinDaily were among those affected. SCMP reported at the time that Jingse had had 350,000 “unique daily visitors” prior to the ban, and claimed that “a major revenue source” for the channel was paid content from blockchain-related projects. Reportedly publishing over 200 articles per day, a sponsored article was said to cost 12 Ethereum, valued $3,500 at the time.In a statement obtained by SCMP, the Huobi team gave a more indeterminate rationale as to the reason for the blocking of its WeChat account, attributing it to the authorities’ “broad action targeting industrial media.”SCMP also pointed to a March 2018 article from People’s Daily, the “mouthpiece” of the Communist Party, which had levelled vigorous accusations at blockchain news outlets:“These ‘media’ outlets have made a huge fortune in the speculative wave of cryptocurrencies, but due to their nature, it’s doubtful how long their barbaric growth can keep on going.”Just a day later, on August 22, local reports surfaced that all commercial venues had been prohibited from hosting crypto-related events in Beijing’s Chaoyang district.The new notice banned all public spaces in the district — including shopping malls, hotels, and office buildings — from hosting any form of crypto-related promotions. Among the reasons given to justify the measures, the notice cited the “protection of public property rights,” “prevention of money laundering,” and the upholding of “the security and stability of the financial system.” It appealed to citizens to come forth to denounce any violations of its terms.That same day, the China National Fintech Risk Rectification Office identified 124 crypto trading platforms with overseas IP addresses and was intending to block access to their services.New measures were also reportedly underway to toughen the “clean-up” of third party crypto payment channels, including those used by OTC platforms, and other “loopholes” through which investors could still gain access to ICOs and crypto. Officials from China’s Office for Special Remediation of Internet Financial Risks were said to be set to meet with third-party payment institutions and order them to cease any crypto-related dealings.On August 24, a fresh risk alert was issued by five Chinese government regulators — the CRBC, PBoC, Ministry of Public Security, Central Network Information Office, and the General Administration of Market Supervision. The notice sounded the alarm on “lawless entities” attempting to amass funds “using the banner of ‘financial innovation’ and ‘blockchain’ and distributing ‘so-called ‘virtual currency,’ ‘virtual assets,’ and ‘digital assets.’”“Such activities are not really based on blockchain technology, but rather the practice of speculative blockchain concepts for illegal fundraising, pyramid schemes, and fraud,” the document stated, urging the public to stay “rational”:“[Such schemes are] rely on [...] internet chat tools for trading, use online payment tools to collect funds, rent overseas servers, yet actually carry out activities for domestic residents [...] the funds for these illegal activities are mostly overseas, and supervision and tracking are very difficult.”The notice declared that authorities would be ratcheting up measures against “illegal” ICOs.That same day, China’s mobile payment app Alipay —  run by Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial — took measures to restrict and even permanently block any accounts it found to be using its network to transact Bitcoin OTC.According to a Beijing News report, Alibaba was in the process of establishing an inspection system for identifying “key websites and accounts.” Sources from Ant Financial told the news agency the firm would be conducting a “risk prevention” program intended to educate users about the dangers of false crypto-related “propaganda.”On August 27, China’s “Google” Baidu, closed at least two popular crypto-related chat forums, with a notice reportedly informing users that the move was “in accordance with relevant laws, regulations and policies.”Two days later, the prohibition against commercial venues from hosting crypto-related events was then extended to Guangzhou Development District, a special economic zone in southern China, close to Hong Kong.As a feverish August passed, however, SCMP came out with a fresh report describing the resilience with which crypto traders continued to circumvent government restrictions.Published September 8, the article reflected that it seemed “practically impossible to ever impose a complete shutdown on trading.”According to SCMP, in the days that followed late August’s toughened measures, the combined trading volume on seven exchanges popular among Chinese traders had indeed dropped by around 33 percent. Yet multiple industry figures emphasized that as long as a platform remained nominally offshore and supported p2p transactions, regulators would face an almost intractable challenge to wipe out such trading entirely.Terence Tsang, COO of TideBit, told SCMP that:“The latest warning and potentially increased monitoring of foreign platforms is targeted at a batch of smaller exchanges that had claimed to be foreign entities, but are in fact operating in China, claiming they have outsourced their operations to a Chinese company […] Those exchanges whose website landing pages are in Chinese have drawn particular scrutiny by regulators.”The report further outlined how traders had begun leveraging Tether (USDT) as a means of entering and exiting cryptocurrency markets. Combined with a VPN, two traders could then use an “overseas” platform as an intermediary to swap crypto for fiat and vice versa.“Two individuals who have both completed a ‘know-your-customer’ procedure with an exchange would swap ‘fiat’ currencies […] to Tether,” SCMP reported, detailing how:“The exchange plays the role of an overseer of such trades, and stands ready to adjudicate in cases of failed trades, or transactions that are not honored […] the money will usually be transferred through bank accounts, or third party online payment networks, between these two individuals. Once Tether is received, then the trader can start trading crypto-to-crypto on any exchange, with the execution done through VPNs.”The report quoted a source “close to” one such exchange as saying that “while Chinese regulators definitely have the technical ability to shut down VPNs […] traditionally it takes numerous conversations with different stakeholders to reach a consensus on configuring a firewall, which lengthens the process.”Even as restrictions on operating VPN services were in place, there were no “current or even foreseeable restrictions” on their private use, the source reportedly added.Two days later, WeChat blocked the official sales channel of Bitcoin (BTC) mining giant Bitmain — without apparently shuttering either its after-sales services or its official account. Yet again, the media platform issued a rules violation notice, stating that:""Following users' complaints, [WeChat] has reviewed and discovered that this account — without having acquired authorized credentials or licenses — has been publishing and distributing information of relevant businesses it is involved in.""Cointelegraph’s sources in China considered at the time that company-run accounts were seemingly being more stringently targeted than those run by individuals, as suggested by the platform’s handling of the account “Crypto Mad Man,” which operated under the WeChat ID “shuzihuobiqushikuangren.”The channel’s official account — a crypto price prediction channel which was run by an individual — remained live, whereas its sub-account — run by a company, and including the occasional promotion of new altcoins — had been banned.On September 18, the Shanghai headquarters of the PBoC yet again “reminded” investors of the risks associated with ICOs and crypto trading, censuring the “unauthorized” and “illegal” financing model for posing a “serious disruption” to the “economic, financial, and social order.”The bank again lauded the success of the authorities’ pummeling of the crypto industry, especially the recent, “timely” and “targeted” measures undertaken by the National Internet Financial Risk Special Remediation Leading Group:“[China’s] global share of domestic virtual currency transactions has dropped from the initial 90% to less than 5%, effectively [preventing] the virtual currency bubble caused by skyrocketing global virtual currency prices in the second half of last year [from affecting] China’s financial market. The impact has been highly recognized by the community.”PBoC further stated that “the relevant third-party payment channels have been checked,” resulting in the closure of “around 3,000 accounts engaged in virtual currency transactions.”As the central bank continued to flaunt statistics that seemingly attested to the success of its policies, Chinese tech journal Technode circulated an academic analysis of cryptocurrencies’ prevalence among a certain social stratum of the Middle Kingdom: on September 26, it published the ""2018 White Paper on the New Middle Class,"" prepared by Chinese financial writer and Professor of Shanghai Zhejiang University, Wu Xiaobo.TechNode noted that this was “the first time” that the annual report had included Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as an investment option, as part of its efforts to “decipher China’s middle class and their purchasing, investment, career, family, and value profiles.”The report portrayed an apparently “risk-averse” demographic: digital currency was identified as the least popular asset in the respondents’ portfolios — with less than 10 percent holding any such investment. Wu’s analysis found that only 9.2 percent of surveyed individuals said they would accept an investment loss higher than 15 percent — leaving over 90 percent distinctly unlikely to take the plunge on the notoriously volatile crypto markets.That same day, the official state-run Xinhua News Agency released its own account of the present situation in the wake of the PBoC’s renewed warnings and other restrictive measures: it published a “reporter’s” account of how despite the summer’s measures, ICO’s continued to “reemerge.”Notably, the report characterized ICOs using a Chinese idiom “Ge jiucai”  — which translates roughly as “cutting the leek” — as a metaphor for the agency’s belief that ICOs are little more than fraudulent Ponzi schemes.Cointelegraph’s Chinese sources clarified that the idiom derives from the fact that the leek is a plant that reproduces itself very fast — an analogy for the constantly proliferating stream of incoming new investors to such schemes. The “cutting”  — or harvesting — refers to perpetrators making away with a bundle of money:“Since potential new investors are numerous and there are always more people who can join the game and be lured, this fraudulent game can repeat itself over and over again.”Xinhua outlined that even as crypto-fiat trading and the publication of ICO hype had been curtailed, OTC transactions remained a time-tested means for domestic investors to purchase crypto:“Upon logging in to OTCBTC, CoinCola, and other platforms you can see that the platform has an off-exchange area, [and that] through Alipay, WeChat, or a bank transfer, you can easily buy mainstream currencies such as Bitcoin.”The agency noted that traders could then easily enter crypto-crypto trading areas to purchase any ICO token they wished. Citing an unnamed “industry insider,” Xinhua compared OTC trades to “Taobao shopping” — a popular Alibaba-owned e-commerce platform. The source remarked:“It seems that throughout the entire transaction process, these platforms do not violate the relevant policies, and that over-the-counter transaction has actually opened a loophole into ICO token transactions.”It was further suggested that social media accounts that “enable crypto trading under the guise of blockchain” remained just as active as before the September 4 ban. Moreover, it was alleged that — facilitated by social media — crypto exchanges and ICO projects continued to “join forces” to perpetrate ruinous ‘pyramid’ schemes.Further “industry insiders” portrayed the lucrative, offshoot industry of social media platforms. Social media accounts were said to be engaged in forms of commercial writing, project meetings and even liaising offline interviews to further the promotion of ICOs. “Some social media actors will ask for 100,000 yuan or at least 1 Bitcoin, and some video interviews will cost 1,000 yuan for 1 minute,” the agency claimed.The article diagnosed the litany of evasions that continued to succeed despite toughened measures. It reiterated that despite their relocations “overseas,” trading platforms nonetheless continued to focus on providing services to domestic traders.“For example, some platforms register in Malta,” but provide Chinese web pages in parallel to their English-language homepages; many evade supervision by creating groups on Telegram to facilitate “believers.” VPN usage remains rife.An interview with an ICO project leader at a business incubator event in Beijing’s Haidan district revealed the surreptitious “new ecology” of China’s ICO space:“In order to evade supervision, a foundation is set up abroad to issue ICO tokens. The fundraising remains primarily targeted domestic investors. The project white paper can be purchased on “Taobao” at a price of around RMB 40,000.”Moreover, the interviewee said, the ICO project pays a “foreign face” to “provide a facade” — beyond this role, the figure behind it “rarely shows up.”The reporter also cited an industry research institute's monitoring of five of the most popular crypto trading platforms among Chinese investors — such as Binance and OKEx — during the first half of 2018. Out of 337 listed coins, the institute identified 264 successfully completed ICOs. Noting that the figure overlapped with the “264 ICO tokens issued ‘overseas,’” the trading platforms were reported to have removed them, having identified them as projects targeting Chinese investors.  As of August 21, Xinhua stated, 98.8 percent of the 264 currencies had all but collapsed in value. As a cautionary tale, the reporter interviewed Liu Peng, an investor in the city of Tianjin, who related how he had himself used loophole mechanisms to access crypto trading platforms. His initial investment of 80,000 yuan was alleged to now be valued at less than 20,000 yuan.Peng observed that many borrowed money to speculate on coins, with some subsequent losses coming to as high as over 90 percent.“In the face of the resurgence of virtual currency speculation, the industry calls for supervision to continue to deepen,” the reporter declared.Li Honghan, a researcher at the International Monetary Institute of Renmin University of China, remarked that social media continued to circulate “false propaganda” misleading investors; a figure in charge of a “relevant” department at the Beijing Financial Work Bureau said it was “necessary to take timely measures” — such as shutting down media accounts in order to prevent their participation in the ICO “hype.”Xu Zezhen, secretary of the Party Committee of the Beijing Internet Finance Industry Association, commented that in the context of the ban on ICOs, many companies claim to be blockchain-related but in fact “sell dog meat.” Again, Zezhen considered such projects were simply “Ge jiucai.”The colorful rhetoric of Xinhua’s scathing report betrays a vehemence that is commensurate with the apparent indomitability of China’s crypto community, vindicating commentators’ shrewd predictions that any measures to dampen crypto-related activities could only ever be a “Pyrrhic victory.”The forthcoming third part of Cointelegraph’s crypto in China series will delve into the apparent paradoxes that govern the ownership, useability and legal protection of cryptocurrencies in the country, even as the official curtailment of trading has reached fever pitch. This is part two of a three-part series on crypto regulation in China, read part one - here, and part three – here."

Total views. 370 ...","Oct 18, 2018","Be honest: shopping with cryptocurrency isn’t always the easiest experience. Even if price volatility is on your side, spending funds can be nightmarish. Crypto is gaining in popularity but many merchants still don’t accept it – meaning you are stuck with those age-old, boring options of paying by card or cash.","A “technology enabler” startup known as Cyclebit is aiming to simplify things by enabling stores to serve as “cryptocurrency gateways” – enticing crypto enthusiasts to come and spend their coins with them and inject some new funds into the economy.The idea has already started to gain traction – and Cyclebit is already working with businesses in Europe and South Korea. According to the print version of the Spanish business newspaper Expansión from 16 Oct 2018, the crypto payment technology is being rolled out in Nostrum – a network of 130 coffee shops throughout Spain – which has just started accepting and selling Bitcoin.Unlike some of the other startups in this space, Cyclebit says it already has access to a working ecosystem provided by Ibox – an omnichannel payment platform that has an annual turnover of $1 billion.Ultimately, Cyclebit hopes to make every point-of-sale device capable of accepting crypto payments, and its team has amassed experience in building large payment networks.Merchants would be given a “ready-to-install, free customizable app for iOS and Android which is able to accept payments from crypto wallets as well as old-fashioned banks. Cyclebit believes this will unlock new revenue streams for them, and increase loyalty. Integration protocols for online and mobile stores would soon follow, with each tool providing an easy way for merchants to control and analyze the crypto transactions they have completed.In its white paper, the team behind Cyclebit argue that its infrastructure could ultimately help to reduce the volatility seen in cryptocurrencies. This is because easy ways to pay using crypto would help it make the transition from an enthusiasts’ hobby, to a mass financial asset – with mass ownership preventing massive fluctuations.The company also believes that the crypto phenomenon, at least in its current form, is far too complicated for the mass majority of consumers. Cyclebit says most shoppers find the idea of crypto payments as “prohibitively complex as obtaining crypto in the first place” – and passionately argues that this must change. Cyclebit says:“Our experience says, that at the heart of any successful solution is always simplicity and usability. This is how our approach is meant to change cryptocurrency – make it simple, convenient and accessible for both merchants and mass customers.”Work is continuing to develop Cyclebit’s core product: a complete ecosystem for crypto ownership and payments that supports an array of cryptocurrencies and popular altcoins.The startup explained: “Many companies are working to provide a much easier way to buy and spend cryptocurrencies. What unites them all is the intent to simplify the user experience and bury every complicated detail in the backend, removing the skill gap for users. The idea is to make the purchasing and payment experience close to already existing well known procedures for credit cards or contactless payments.”Cyclebit hopes that using crypto for cappuccinos will become an exciting starting point. Over time, it plans for its technology to extend beyond exchanging Litecoin for lattes and Bitcoin for brownies.Disclaimer. Cointelegraph does not endorse any content or product on this page.

But right now the world doesn’t need a store of wealth unless you need that store of wealth for things you should not be doing.”Although Fink expressed some skepticism towards cryptocurrencies, he pointed out that the company is “a huge believer in blockchain.”“The biggest use for blockchain will be in mortgages, mortgage applications, mortgage ownership, anything that’s labored with paper.”Fink’s comments come ahead of the Nov. 5 deadline that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) set for reviewing proposed rule changes related to a series of applications to list and trade various BTC ETFs. The review period affects nine separate ETFs that had been proposed by three different applicants, including ProShares, in conjunction with the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) ETF exchange NYSE Arca, and Direxion.Last month, crypto analyst and host of CNBC’s show Cryptotrader Ran Neuner claimed  that a Bitcoin ETF is a “way bigger deal” than a cash settlement Bitcoin futures contract, since it “requires actual purchase of BTC.”"

The government said the directive was needed to “protect the property rights of the public, protect the status of the renminbi [RMB]* as the statutory currency, prevent risks of money laundering and protect financial stability.”* Renminbi or [Chinese] yuan are interchangeably used to refer to China’s national fiat currency.While warning that “excessive speculation” in virtual currencies* “harms the public interest and the legal currency status of the RMB, the government nonetheless allowed citizens to freely participate in the online trading of such commodities “at their own risk.”* The term 虚拟货币 (“virtual currencies”) is used to designate cryptocurrencies in Chinese.2013’s so-called ‘Notice on Precautions Against the Risks of Bitcoin’ was signed by five official entities, the People’s Bank of China (PBoC), the Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC), the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), and the China Insurance Regulatory Commission (CIRC).The notice stipulated that financial and payment insitutitions were prohibited from dealings in Bitcoin, including banks, and that crypto exchanges should register with the government’s Telecommunications Regulatory Agency and comply with anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) measures. It also advocated for financial institutions to propagate investment and virtual currency education in order to “guide the public to establish correct monetary concepts and investment philosophy.”The PBoC considered at the time that “the public lacks sufficient understanding of Bitcoin, and some individuals have been caught up by faddishness or a speculative mentality in holding, using and trading in Bitcoin,” warning that “ordinary investors who blindly follow the crowd can easily suffer major losses.”On Jan. 20 the PBoC held a Digital Currency Seminar, attended by PBoC governor Zhou Xiaochuan, the bank’s deputy governor, and a gamut of experts from domestic and foreign research and financial institutions, as well as consulting firms — including representatives from Deloitte and Citigroup. In its official press release, the central bank stated its intent to launch a state-backed digital currency, considering the move would have “positive practical and far-reaching historical, significance”:“Since 2014, [the PBoC] has set up a dedicated research team [to thoroughly study] a framework for digital currency issuance [encompassing its prospective] circulation, environment, legal problems, the impact of digital currency on the economic and financial system, [and] the relationship between legal and privately issued digital currency.”The central bank stated that it considered that a state-backed “legal” digital currency could bring down the high cost of distributing and circulating paper notes, as well as bring greater transparency to economic transactions — thereby reducing money laundering, tax evasion, and other criminal acts. It also proposed its issuance would have a positive impact on financial inclusion, help to improve China’s new financial infrastructure, and enhance the efficiency of payment and settlement systems .The statement further proposed that digital currency would give the central bank greater control over the circulation of money, bolstering economic and social development. Reports at the time estimated that around $843 billion of capital had flowed out of China in the eleven months leading up to November 2015 — meaning that policy makers were being forced to inject funds into the system in order to prevent interest rates from rising.Even as the bank lauded the “great importance” of its digital currency project and praised participants’ rigorous analyses of relevant theoretical matters, practical exploration and development prospects, it notably remained silent on the phenomenon of decentralized cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.On Jan. 6, the country’s central bank, the PBoC, released a notice that it had contacted relevant regulatory authorities and ordered them to meet with major Bitcoin trading platforms to scrutinize their business operations and regulatory compliance and carry out a corresponding “clean-up” where necessary. The notice reaffirmed the official stance that Bitcoin was not considered currency by China’s government.Renewed attention came as the estimated share of global Bitcoin trading denominated in the Chinese yuan was commonly set at between 50 to as high as 90 percent.The day before the bank’s action, Jan. 5, the global Bitcoin market had taken a steep 21 percent price plummet, with Bitcoin tumbling from over $1190 to $938. The South China Morning Post (SCMP) reported that — in the midst of the coin’s vertiginous decline — Chinese investors were experiencing system failures on major exchanges such as BTCC and OKCoin.PwC China Fintech Partner William Gee told SCMP that “investors suffered losses as they were unable to trade, possibly because of the sudden price fluctuation and large sell offers.” The official China Securities Journal had for its part stated that:“Regulators have noticed that some Bitcoin platforms crashed during the recent market volatilities, causing some investors, particularly those trading with leverage tools, to bear huge losses because they were unable to log on to the website during the sell-off.”Domestic industry leaders stepped up to calm investors, as news of the on-site inspections only further unsettled market participants. Bobby Lee, CEO of the popular Shanghai-headquartered BTCC exchange, tweeted on Jan. 6:“BTCC regularly meets with the People's Bank of China and we work closely with them to ensure that we are operating in accordance with the laws and regulations of China. The press release put forth from the PBOC today outlines that there is significant volatility in Bitcoin trading, and also quoted from a notice released in 2013 saying that Bitcoin is a virtual good and doesn’t have legal tender status. All of our users should be aware of the current policies on virtual goods as well as the risks involved in trading in volatile markets.”On Jan. 11, the PBoC launched spot checks into leading domestic crypto exchanges BTCC, Huobi and OKCoin. Reuters contextualized the move at the time as part of Beijing’s efforts to “stem capital outflows” and “relieve pressure” on the yuan. The agency noted that the yuan had fallen 6.6 percent against the dollar over the course of 2016 — the worst chapter in its price performance since 1994.Several crypto analysts had gone so far as predict an eventual “quasi-synchronization” between the yuan’s declining fortunes and Bitcoin’s ascent, noting that Chinese investors were increasingly using the cryptocurrency as a vehicle for conveying value into more stable foreign currencies — and also as an instrument for speculative trading. The Omni Foundation’s Patrick Dugan proposed that “for every one percent that the yuan devalues, Bitcoin pops 10-15 percent.”On the day of the inspections, PBoC’s Shanghai headquarters clarified that “in order to prevent market risks,” the central bank was scrutinizing exchanges’ business practices and regulatory compliance standards, mentioning only BTCC by name.View of the action as being tied to escalating capital outflows was widely echoed, with China’s QQ.com reporting that the bank’s crypto exchange scrutiny was “possibly to investigate the use of the digital asset to evade capital controls.”The trend significantly raised the stakes for Chinese crypto traders; director of the Finance and Securities Research Institution at Wuhan University of Science and Technology, Dong Dengxin, observed that “the policy risks of Bitcoin trading in China are higher” because of the country’s capital controls. “If bitcoin trading disturbs China’s financial order, there’s a possibility it will be deemed illegal or banned.”China’s ‘big three’ exchanges, Huobi, OKCoin and BTCC — which had hitherto been zero-fee — soon announced in separate statements on Jan. 22 that they would begin charging clients a flat 0.2 percent commission fee for each transaction. The exchanges are said to have rationalized the move by stating that such fees would help “curb market manipulation and extreme volatility.”An insider source claimed at the time that while the exchanges had not received direct instructions from the PBoC, they had decided to introduce trading fees to align with the bank’s wishes “to see the Bitcoin market cool down.” The platforms also stopped margin lending under the pressure of PBoC’s intensified scrutiny.On Feb. 8, the central bank then warned nine smaller domestic exchanges that they faced potential closure if they violated regulations or offered margin lending. Of the larger exchanges, OKCoin and Huobi issued statements on Feb. 9 they would be halting Bitcoin withdrawals completely, with BTCC reviewing the matter and subsequently announcing on Feb. 15 it would be suspending crypto withdrawals until March 15.The withdrawal freeze on all three platforms eventually lasted until early June, and had an almost immediately-felt impact on the Bitcoin market. As CryptoCompare.com’s Charles Hayter observed mid-February:“When China sneezes Bitcoin catches a cold. The PBoC moves to regulate Bitcoin more stringently will bring short term woes. Volumes can be expected to again slow in China as more friction is incorporated in the form of KYC and AML policies. For the duration of this transition the CNY-BTC pairs can be expected to trade at a discount to other fiat-BTC pairs.”On Sept. 4, a total of seven Chinese central government regulators — the PBoC, the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), MIIT, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC), CBRC, CSRC, and CIRC — jointly issued an Announcement on Preventing Financial Risks from Initial Coin Offerings (ICO Rules).The announcement stated that ICOs that raise “so-called virtual currencies” such as Bitcoin and Ethereum “through the irregular sale and circulation of tokens” are engaging in “unauthorized” public financing, which is illegal.It reiterated that virtual currencies involved in ICOs are “not issued by the country’s monetary authority” and therefore are neither legal nor mandatorily-valid tender. They are divested of the legal status of fiat currencies and so “cannot and should not be circulated nor used in the market as currencies.”The ICO Rules further warned that a host of financial crimes — such as the illegal issuance of tokens or securities, illegal fundraising, financial fraud, or pyramid schemes — may be associated with ICO projects, and that, if discovered, such cases would be transferred to the country’s judiciary.The announcement ordered all types of ICOs to “be stopped immediately” and to return any assets held in investors’ accounts to these investors as soon as possible.Not only were domestic ICOs banned, but the first of a series of restrictions were imposed on cryptocurrency exchanges. Pursuant to the new rules, exchanges were forbidden from enabling clients to convert legal tender into crypto, or vice versa; from buying or selling virtual currencies as a central counterparty; and from setting a price for virtual currencies, or providing other related brokerage or commission services.Further, the MIIT stated it would shut down websites, delist crypto-trading mobile applications from app stores, and would request that the SAIC revoke the business licenses of exchanges.The Sept. 4 announcement also extended the existing prohibition on financial and payment institutions’ crypto dealings, stating that they were forbidden from “directly or indirectly” providing products or “services such as account opening, registration, transaction clearing or settlement” for ICOs and virtual currencies. They were also barred from providing insurance services to both ICOs and crypto-related businesses.Lastly, the seven regulators robustly warned against investors being “fooled” by ICO and crypto-related investments, soliciting the public to “report relevant violations in a timely manner.” The announcement ordered financial industry organizations to “self-discipline” and “stay away from market chaos,” in order to collectively maintain a “normal” financial order.Following the announcement, on Sept. 15 the Beijing Internet Finance Risk Working Group met with senior officials of crypto trading platforms in the Chinese capital, ordering them to set a deadline for ceasing their trading services; to immediately stop registering new clients; and to outline a detailed plan for how to refund clients’ assets. Authorities were also reported to have issued similar orders to crypto exchange officials based in the cities of Shenzhen and Shanghai.“The scope of the cleanup” was not limited to curtailing major exchanges’ operations, but aimed at an internet-wide swoop of related websites, internet forums, as well as chat groups on WeChat and QQ — two of China’s most popular social media platforms. The former counted a staggering 963 million active users at the time.In a media interview mid-September, Lokman Tsui, an assistant professor at the School of Journalism and Communication at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, noted that many hitherto active crypto-dedicated groups on WeChat were swiftly disbanding:“If you are a group chat leader you have two choices, either you are going to super actively monitor the group, because your livelihood is at stake, or you’re going to delete the group. It’s a chilling effect.”China’s largest crypto exchanges swiftly fell into line with Beijing’s orders. BTCC told customers on Sept. 14 it would completely shut down on Sept. 30 in accordance with the new restrictions, and would refund any renminbi, Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ethereum held in users’ accounts.Huobi made a similar announcement on Sept. 15, stating it would be halting new registrations and deposit services, and would be ceasing all services by Sept. 30. OKCoin announced on Sept. 15 it would cease all trading on Sept. 30.Also on Sept. 15, ViaBTC said it would deactivate the ViaBTC official website for mainland China Sept. 30 and return any holdings of renminbi or Bitcoins to clients before then.By mid-September 2017, reports were emerging that the impact of the protracted freeze on services at major domestic crypto exchanges as they had faced scrutiny from the PBoC had seen the country’s share of global Bitcoin trading drop to just over 10 percent.Yet even as the dust was just beginning to settle on the September ban, Chinese investors were increasingly turning to alternatives such as peer-to-peer (p2p) platforms and OTC trades; China’s LocalBitcoins market posted its highest-ever weekly volumes of 115 million yuan during the week leading up to Sep. 23.By Oct. 27, the “second life” of China’s exiled “crypto barons” was already becoming apparent — 19 formerly China-based companies had already applied for a Japanese crypto exchange license. Other crypto-“friendlier” jurisdictions at that time were deemed to include Hong Kong, Singapore and South Korea.As early as May, OKCoin had in fact begun to encourage domestic traders to migrate to its newly-launched Hong-Kong based fiat-crypto trading platform OKEx, beginning with futures trading.On Nov. 1 OKEx launched an OTC platform, with the Chinese yuan tellingly the only supported fiat currency at the outset. The company’s financial market director, Lennix Lai, said that the new OTC service would aim to serve Chinese investors, many of whom had been tiding over the tumultuous 2017 fall by trading p2p.In parallel, Huobi rebranded as Huobi Pro and incorporated its operations in the Seychelles, then rolling out its own OTC service on Nov. 4 to enable direct, p2p yuan-crypto transactions.Alongside their relocations overseas, OKEx and Huobi’s OTC platforms thus enabled domestic investors to use mobile payment methods such as Alibaba’s Alipay or Tencent’s WeChat Pay to purchase cryptocurrencies. OTC purchases were typically made a ten or even twenty percent premium as compared with prices on global crypto exchanges, due to the intensity of demand in an increasingly stifled trading climate.In November, the government caught up: China’s National Committee of Experts on Internet Financial Security issued a Bitcoin OTC report, remarking that “over-the-counter trading is booming,” and that “this warrants further attention.”The report took stock of burgeoning number of OTC platforms, highlighting that whereas only four such platforms had been active before October, the number had now risen to twenty one.Taiwan-based OTC platform OTCBTC, according to media reports, had seen $100 million in transactions in the first 50 days since its launch in October.In an interview with SCMP, Leonhard Weese, president of the Bitcoin Association of Hong Kong, further observed that even as OTC services had not been officially banned, increasing concerns over government surveillance were pushing p2p traders to encrypted messaging services such as Telegram:“Telegram is very popular for large over-the-counter trades. While WeChat is used by the less paranoid.”In those last months of a turbulent year, Wesse considered that China’s “authorities are more worried about the narrative, rather than what people actually do. Once it gets widely reported that Bitcoin trading is well and alive in China, the government will again try to put a lid on it.”Between 2013-2017, China’s authorities thus evolved an increasingly draconian stance as their perception of the financial risks posed by cryptocurrencies hardened. In 2013 they deemed Bitcoin to be a “faddish” and speculative phenomenon, thus prohibiting financial institutions’ dealings with crypto, yet allowing individual investors to bear the risks for their trades.Pressure on the yuan and escalating capital outflows provided fresh impetus for coordinated action from the country’s regulators; they specifically targeted the ICO space, perceiving it to be rife with dangers for wider fiscal stability, and took action against online trading platforms. The measures nonetheless inadvertently fostered alternative channels such as OTC trades and did not prevent exchanges from flourishing in “friendlier” overseas jurisdictions.Cointelegraph’s three-part series will continue to trace Chinese authorities’ continued attempts to ring-fence crypto from mainland investors, as they broadened their offensive to tackle the mining industry, as well as perceived regulatory “loopholes,” both on- and offline.This is part one of a three-part series on crypto regulation in China, read part two – here, and part three – here."

The Armenian Prime Minister and other top officials were reportedly in attendance.","The new mining farm is reportedly a joint venture by major Armenian conglomerate Multi Group, founded by oligarch and politician Gagik Tsarukyan, and controversial international mining firm Omnia Tech.Tsarukyan is the founder of Tsarukyan Alliance, which represents the second biggest parliamentary bloc in the Armenian Parliament, having sealed over 27 percent of the vote in the country’s 2017 elections; he is also reportedly a “key” business partner of former Armenian President Robert Kocharyan.Multi Group employs over 25,000 people through its various subsidiaries, according to News Armenia.Aside from Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan and Tsarukyan, the event is reported to have been attended by numerous international businessmen, with Tsarukyan representing the event as drawing guests “from almost forty countries,” and further quoted by News Armenia as saying that:“This is an important step towards the development of the information technology sector, especially since representatives of foreign business circles are planning to meet with government members to find out the possibilities of new and more ambitious investments in the Armenian economy and expanding the base of cooperation.""News Armenia reports that around $50 million has been invested in the creation of the new mining farm, which is said to currently have 3,000 Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) mining machines, and a planned capacity of 120,000 in future.The report further states that “Omnia is the owner of equipment used in farms” belonging to prominent cloud mining firm Genesis Mining. It continues to allege that “Omnia provides Genesis with mining equipment and finances its servicing.”This latter point is highly controversial given that  in 2017, Omnia was accused of misappropriating the Genesis brand name and falsely claiming to have an association with the high-profile firm; Genesis has repeatedly refuted this representation, clarifying that Omnia had simply purchased hashpower from the firm and was a customer, but without any official partnership or substantive business ties.In May of this year, Omnia was further accused of operating a pyramid scheme by security researcher Chris Kubecka, who similarly underscored the company’s false claims to have a legitimate association with Genesis.As previously reported, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev has proposed that all countries in the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU), including Armenia, should be part of a unified crypto-regulatory approach, given the “strong” and “close” economic ties between the bloc’s members."

As BBC reports, Cryptopay refused the request, as such a change would contravene company policy.Salonen sent an explosive device in a padded envelope addressed to two Cryptopay employee’s in Hackney, London in November 2017, and the package was delivered to an accounting firm previously used by Cryptopay.Several months later in March 2018, a worker at the office began opening the package, but stopped when he became suspicious of the contents. The package was referred to the Met Police Counter Terrorism Command who forwarded DNA information from the bomb to Interpol, alerting Swedish authorities to Salonen’s activities. According to BBC, Salonen was already known to Swedish police.Founded in late 2014, Cryptopay is a Bitcoin (BTC) wallet, debit card service, and exchange for U.K. and European Union clients. Cryptopay co-founder George Basiladze told Cointelegraph that the firm had changed offices a “few months before the parcel was delivered.” No one was hurt in the incident, and “none of [Cryptopay’s] employees have ever worked at that address.”Following the recent news, Cryptopay subsequently tweeted that resetting a password is “no problem,” in case it is forgotten:Source: Cryptopay TwitterOn Oct. 31, a number of firms in Amsterdam faced another case of crypto extortion by email, with an anonymous individual threatening an attack with hand grenades if they did not send 50,000 euro ($57,000) to his Bitcoin wallet.Earlier this year, Cointelegraph reported that Russian crypto blogger and trader Pavel Nyashin has been found dead in his apartment in Saint Petersburg.

These coins can then be exchanged for other assets including Bitcoin and Ethereum, in addition to fiat currencies such as US dollars.The startup claims that all of this is achieved with a transaction fee that’s below $0.01, and it hopes to drive forward its offering through a “large community of users and developers” who are invested in helping the platform thrive.Minter says it has been established with a triad of objectives in mind. Firstly, it wants to ensure users have access to an easy-to-own cryptocurrency that is optimized for everyday use. The company has also concocted the irresistible notion that “everyone is the bank,” meaning anyone can issue and manage their own currencies. Minter also prioritizes liquidity, and says “every coin should have instant and absolute liquidity.”At the beating heart of Minter is a native token known as Blockchain Instant Payment (BIP). As well as having “a lot of competitive advantages over common coins,” the startup claims it has the potential to distinguish itself from mainstream financial institutions. While the commission charged on transfers through the likes of PayPal and old-fashioned banks can be as high as 5 or 10 percent respectively, Minter says that BIP’s costs are less than $0.01 – or sometimes even free. Whereas a bank transfer can take days, its payment solution wraps things up in five seconds. And while Ethereum and Bitcoin are not mobile-ready, Minter’s platform is.The company argues that its solution is necessary as certain platforms are never going to change. Its white paper explains: “PayPal will always have a high commission as its main goal is to protect buyers across the globe; banks will never be able to speed up transfers as they are all just too different and need intermediaries to facilitate payments.”The blockchain has recently announced that it is integrating with the Telegram Open Network – enabling Minter users to transfer any coins issued on its network to TON’s blockchain. With one of the services Telegram plans to roll out, TON Payments, Minter users will be able to send and receive micropayments in Minter-based coins using the Lightning Network.This is the latest announcement to be made about the cooperation of Minter and Telegram. Early adopters of the blockchain network have been able to pass “know your customer” procedures via Telegram Passport in the space of a few minutes, which was marked by Telegram on its official blog.Once Minter officially launches, the platform is planning to hold what it describes as “the largest airdrop in Telegram’s history” – with users receiving BIP and other Minter-issued coins worth almost 1,000 Bitcoins – for those who sign up before October 31, 2018. In addition, the project is offering a 25 percent bonus to all users who top up their balance until October 19 2018, 19:00 UTC.In its white paper, Minter says it is passionate about teaming up with TON because its founders, Pavel and Nikolai Durov, are “vocal advocates of freedom and independence.”The startup wants to be developer-friendly, enabling new apps to be built, to push the platform forward. Other features include usernames as addresses, meaning that crypto enthusiasts will no longer need to memorize long strings of random characters whenever they want to complete a transaction, and future compatibility with payment systems such as Apple Pay and Android Pay. Minter plans for BIP tokens to be gradually released over a seven-year period.Disclaimer. Cointelegraph does not endorse any content or product on this page.

According to Ephrata city administrator Wes Crago, those four crypto operations — including two at the Port of Ephrata, one in an industrial area of the city, as well as one in a residential area — are being relocated at the moment.The decision for the suspension was taken by a city council vote, with six council members voting in favor of the new cryptocurrency regulations, and only one commissioner, Matt Moore, voting against.Moore noted that even a temporary ban can pose a threat for the city’s economic development since it puts the industry “outside the city’s expertise,” adding that he does not want to “surrender any economic opportunity big or small.”Council member Kathleen Allstot clarified that the new ban implies taking a one-year “break” in order to see “see what’s going” in the sphere, as well as to find out how mining fits both in Ephrata and the Grant County Public Utility District (PUD).Crypto mining operations have become increasingly popular in the cities of the Columbia Basin due to the region’s cheap electricity sources. However, the growth of crypto mining developments in Ephrata has created some inconveniences for the residents, with some reportedly suffering a lack of electricity due to the operation of the high energy-consuming cooling equipment by the local crypto miners.Ephrata’s recent move goes in line with crypto mining-related regulations imposed by a number of cities in the Grant County PUD, the article notes. In addition to the suspension, Grant Cities has developed new – and sufficiently higher – electricity rates for crypto firms, with the new rates set to be enforced in April 2019.Washington state is reportedly one of the leading crypto mining sites in the world, with one of the biggest mining farms, GigaWatt, located within its borders. The U.S. state currently offers the cheapest power in the country, with $9.56 per kWh for individuals and $8.42 per kWh for businesses.In late July 2018, Franklin PUD commissioners approved a moratorium that will provide staff with extra time to investigate the impact of mining on the electrical system before accepting applications for electricity from crypto mining companies in rural Washington.Earlier in April, Chelan PUD council members ordered staff to enforce a moratorium on cryptocurrency mining following the discovery of unauthorized mining activities, which were considered as “unauthorized loads to law enforcement as power theft.” And in January, Cointelegraph reported on Washington’s Douglas County electrical infrastructure experiencing pressure from cryptocurrency miners."

BitPesa is anAfrican Bitcoin (BTC) startup that was founded in 2013, with an initial focus on crypto-enabled  fiat remittances between the U.K. and Kenya.In a statement accompanying the investment, Sompo outlined that the partnership is focused on the “digitalization of global remittance services,” and that:""Using BitPesa's technology, developed through various experiments in remittances and settlements, we will extend our presence in the international remittance service market and consider the application of this technology to the insurance field.""The release explicitly states that Sompo plans to use the crypto-enabled fiat remittance services deployed by BitPesa to lower the costs and time taken for the global transfer of value, outlining that Sompo’s existing work can be extended to reach a wider customer base via BitPesa’s international remittance services that target developing countries.The release also contextualizes the increasing role of global remittances to economically facilitate the accelerated circulation of people, goods, data, and services worldwide.As previously reported, BitPesa has sealed venture capital financing from the likes of major crypto industry VC firms such as Draper VC, Digital Currency Group, and Pantera Capital. The service has used the funding to develop a global remittance network with Bitcoin as a base currency in order to improve financial infrastructure between the developing world, Europe, and the U.K.Crypto’s role in enabling ease of access to funds and greater efficiency of transactions has been in the spotlight when it comes to addressing wealth generation and investment in Africa, with analysts emphasizing the importance of improving financial inclusion and remittance infrastructure for the continent.In the global insurance sector, the technology that underpins cryptocurrencies, blockchain, is increasingly being considered as a solution to innovate the industry, with insurance firm Marsh this year partnering with IBM on its first commercial blockchain solution for proof of insurance."

compares it favorably with other altcoins, “better known as s**tcoins,” 
“ ...","Oct 11, 2018",American economist Nouriel Roubini has prepared his “debunking” of the crypto and blockchain space in a 30-page testimony set to be delivered at a U.S. congress hearing.,"The hearing will be held today, Oct. 11 by the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, and is devoted to ""Exploring the Cryptocurrency and Blockchain Ecosystem."" Roubini will testify in counterpart to Coin Center director of research Peter Van Valkenburgh.Roubini’s testimony asserts that the crypto “bubble” of winter 2017 was driven by the FOMO (fear of missing out) of “clueless retail investors.” The perpetrators stoking the “literal manic frenzy” of Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoin buying are characterized as “scammers, swindlers, criminals, charlatans, insider whales and carnival barkers,” whom Roubini places under the umbrella of “conflicted insiders.”Roubini, known as “Dr. Doom” for predicting the 2007-2008 housing bubble crash, opens with a comparison of Bitcoin historical price data with the financial bubbles of bygone eras: “Tulip-mania, the Mississippi Bubble, the South Sea Bubble.”He notes Bitcoin’s “70 percent collapse” since its price peak, and then compares it favorably with other altcoins, “better known as s**tcoins,” “thousands” of which he alleges have lost “on average” 95% in value. He continues:“Actually calling this useless vaporware garbage a “s**tcoin” is a grave insult to manure that is a most useful, precious and productive good as a fertilizer in agriculture.”Roubini then apologizes to the Committee members for using the term, claiming that the word is a “standard” “technical term” in crypto jargon, and has over 500000 hits on Google search.Roubini continues to argue that Bitcoin has problems with scalability, is a poor store of value and means of payment, consumes too much energy through mining, has high transaction fees and weak security.Other claims include, for example, that when Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) aren’t scams then they are “non-compliant securities.” As for his latter point on decentralization, he stated:""[W]ealth in crypto-land is more concentrated than in North Korea, where the inequality Gini coefficient is 0.86.""The Gini index is a measure of distribution, often used to evaluate economic inequality in a particular country or region; with 0 assigned to perfect equality, and 1 to unmitigated inequality.To substantiate his claims about Bitcoin’s inequitable distribution, Roubini refers to a 2014 Business Insider report, which had already made the analogy with North Korea.Roubini has been active on Twitter all morning ahead of his testimony; in the one hour before press time, he has tweeted (and retweeted) 27 separate posts on his official account. A typical response to any one critique of his arguments reads:“Another ignoramus in the motley crew of… conflicted insiders who know only how to insult me as they got ZERO points against my 30 page detailed critique of crypto!”"

The questionnaire included a section on cryptocurrency awareness.According to the paper, Chilean men know more about cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin (BTC), with 51 percent saying they've heard of digital coins before. The situation with women is slightly lower, with only 27 percent aware of its existence.Younger Chileans (between 18 and 34) tend to know more about cryptocurrencies than older people. With regards to economic position, the upper-middle class with a high income was the most aware of decentralized currencies — with 75 percent claiming to know about them — followed by the upper middle class and the lower middle class (58 and 36 percent respectively).In regards to general knowledge, Chileans showed a significantly low level of awareness in the financial area. Cryptocurrencies were the last in the list of frequent terms that the citizens have claimed to know about, while banks, insurance companies, and the Ministry of Finance were among the most familiar terms.According to online BTC statistics service Coin Dance, Chile has a significantly low volume of BTC trading in comparison to neighbouring South American countries: the amount of BTC sold weekly barely ever exceeds 60 BTC.The country has recently seen legal turmoil when major Chilean banks closed the accounts of the crypto exchanges BUDA, Orionx, and CryptoMarket (CryptoMKT). The three applied to Chile’s appeals court to cancel the decision, and the judge later took their side by ordering the banks to reopen the accounts.Shortly after the litigation, the country’s central bank suggested that imposing crypto regulation could be useful for monitoring risk. However, the Chilean government has not discussed the matter so far, focusing on blockchain integration instead."

September 2015, the same month BofA was awarded with a crypto-related ...","Nov 4, 2018","On October 30, Bank of America (BofA) added yet another cryptocurrency-related patent to its collection of more than 50 applications filed within the same field.","The second-largest bank in the US has been leading in the informal blockchain patent race, sidestepping such players as IBM and Alibaba. However, that does not mean that BofA is being bullish — the company has been publicly criticizing cryptocurrencies, relying on patents mostly to appear progressive in the fintech community.The bank filed its first blockchain-related patent back in March 2014, and it was published by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) — the agency that awards copyrights on inventions in the country — in September 2015.  Dubbed “Wire Transfers Using Cryptocurrency,” it didn’t mention the word “blockchain” per se, but described a system where funds are sent between accounts using cryptocurrencies’ underlying technology.It appeared to be the first crypto-related application from a major retail bank in the U.S., and possibly worldwide. It does not seem particularly surprising that BofA was the first among its kind to claim such a patent, given that it was also one of the first banks to initiate coverage of Bitcoin in 2013, when it published a report compiled by strategists David Woo, Ian Gordon and Vadim Iaralov. Entitled “Bitcoin: a first assessment,” the paper argued:“Bitcoin could become a major means of payment for e-commerce and may emerge as a serious competitor to traditional money-transfer providers. As a medium of exchange, Bitcoin has clear potential for growth.”In September 2015, the same month BofA was awarded with a crypto-related patent, the financial institution joined R3, a consortium of over 200 members, including various banks, trade associations, and fintech companies, who work towards developing blockchain solutions.Thus, starting with the “Wire Transfers Using Cryptocurrency” entry, blockchain-oriented patents have been piling up for BofA. In December 2015, the USPTO published ten new entries filed by the bank in July 2014, all of which mentioned the word “cryptocurrency” in the title, and referred to various systems, such as “Offline Vault Storage System,” “Online Vault Storage System,” etc.The following month, in January 2016, the bank revealed it was preparing to send 20 more blockchain-oriented patent applications to the USPTO office. In an interview with CNBC, Chief operations and technology officer at BofA, Catherine Bessant said:“As a technologist, the technology is fascinating. We have tried to stay on the forefront. I think we have somewhere around 15 patents, most people would be surprised at Bank of America with patents in the blockchain or cryptocurrency space.”Eventually, BofA secured the first place in an unofficial patent race — by June 2018, the institution held around 45 live patents (meaning that they are active and have not expired), the largest amount among all companies, according to research from Marc Kaufman, an attorney co-chairing the Blockchain Intellectual Property Council at the U.S. Chamber of Digital Commerce. The U.S. bank bypassed such technology-oriented players as IBM and Alibaba, not to mention its direct competitors — Royal Bank of Canada (RBoC) was the second among all banks, holding only eight patents.  BofA’s efforts in the blockchain domain do not necessarily mean that the company will develop actual products. Nor does it mean that the company is being bullish in regards to all things crypto. Quite oppositely, the U.S. bank has clearly prioritized having a registered technology over actually using it.In 2016, Catherine Bessant told CNBC that having blockchain-related patents is “very important [...] to reserve our spot even before we know what the commercial application might be.” On the CB Insights, Future of Fintech event, in New York in June of this year, she reterieted that comment:“We’ve got under 50 patents in the blockchain/distributed ledger space [...] While we’ve not found large-scale opportunities, we want to be ahead of it, we want to be prepared.”Notably, those endeavors didn’t prevent the 113-year-old bank from calling Bitcoin “troubling” and uplifting its decision to ban customers from purchasing crypto with their credit cards. Moreover, in its annual report published in February, BofA admitted that cryptocurrencies are a threat to its business model, stating:“Clients may choose to conduct business with other market participants who engage in business or offer products in areas we deem speculative or risky, such as cryptocurrencies.”In August 2018, Michael Wuehler, a blockchain specialist at ConsenSys, who previously worked at BofA for more than 11 years, as per his LinkedIn profile, took to Twitter to announce that while his name is listed on “8 of 50” BofA blockchain patents as an inventor, they are “meaningless” from his perspective. Wuehler argued that the patents were filed to attract press coverage and make the bank appear progressive in the fintech space.Indeed, having a fintech patent does not necessarily imply it will be used in the future. A blockchain patent, like any other patent, is a set of exclusive rights issued by an official authority — a sovereign state or intergovernmental organization — that an inventor or assignee gets in exchange for revealing their invention to the public.As Bloomberg explains, business-wise blockchain patents “are an essential ingredient for companies looking to reshape the financial services industry or spawn profitable cryptocurrency-related businesses.” Essentially, patents help companies attract investment, protect property rights and collect monopoly profits from other companies using their inventions — and that could be the case with BofA.Here are some details of BofA’s blockchain efforts published by the USPTO within the past year. That should provide a clearer picture of how the bank plans on using the technology, at least hypothetically:BofA’s most recent cryptocurrency-related patent award, which was confirmed on October 30, references storage methods for private keys.Specifically, the filing reads, current opportunities for ensuring private keys remain untampered with are insufficient.“While many […] devices may provide for acquiring evidence of a security breach (i.e., physical or non-physical tampering with the device and/or the data), such devices do not provide for real-time response to such breaches, such that misappropriation of private cryptography keys is prevented.“Therefore, a need exists for a secure means for storing private cryptography keys. The desired storage means should reduce the risk of misappropriation of keys due to the keys being stored internally within a computing node that is frequently or, in some instances, continuously accessible via a public communication network, such as the Internet.”On September 18, the USPTO shared a BofA patent for adapting multiple digital signatures in a distributed network.The patent proposes a system for managing data communication from internet-connected devices. The document underlines that “the invention provides automated determination of which devices are communicating to which third-party entities and, in some embodiments, the type of data being communicated to such third-party entities.”BofA’s proposed system addresses devices within an Internet of Things (IoT) environment, describing how each of devices within the network will communicate data with each other “on an ongoing basis,” while the system would allow a user to “select to prohibit (i.e., block) or limit which data is communicated to which third-party entities.”In July, the USPTO published the bank’s patent for a blockchain-based system allowing the external validation of data.Thus, BofA’s filing proposes using blockchain for tracking resource information and confirming resource transfers, arguing that “a need currently exists for providing a more accurate indication of a user's financial standing by allowing external validation of data in a process data network.”The patent describes how the system would record information on the blockchain based on “aggregated information associated with past transfer of resources executed by an entity,” and would update the information on the blockchain with each new transaction activity.In April, the bank’s application for a patent on a blockchain-based storage system with automated data authentication was unveiled. The document was originally filed in October 2016.In the document, the BofA author describes a blockchain-powered system for authenticating data and providing secured access of said data to service providers. The patent addresses the problem of data transferring and tracking, which it says can be resolved by means of cryptographic keys in a private blockchain:“Embodiments of the invention utilize a private blockchain to store various types of records to be conveyed to the service providers. In this way, the individual or entity may securely store on the blockchain all records relevant to service providers, then provide the service providers with secured access to said records such that the providers may access only the specific records for which they are authorized, e.g. a healthcare provider may access only the healthcare records on the blockchain.”The author also outlines disadvantages of conventional methods of records sharing and keeping, such as e-mail attachments, claiming they are sensitive to tampering as “they lack a built-in mechanism for authenticating records.” A blockchain-based system, in turn, would represent an efficient, secure and reliable way to store records and only provide access to authorized parties, the patent concludes.In December 2017, BofA was awarded with a patent that outlines a digital currency exchange system. As per the document, the system will allow the conversion of one digital currency into another automatically, with the exchange rate to be determined based on external data feeds.Under the patent application, the proposed system would gather data from external information sources on the current virtual currency exchange rates and utilize the data to calculate its own optimal rate. Specifically, the filing reads:""Enterprises may handle a large number of financial transactions on a daily basis. As technology advances, financial transactions involving cryptocurrency have become more common. For some enterprises, it may be desirable to exchange currencies and cryptocurrencies."""

Price crashed, volume crashed — very, very difficult to make money.”Bitcoin has been tightly range bound around $6,300-$6,500 in recent months, and shed close to 68 percent in value since its industry-record highs in December 2017. If its relative price stability of late has been lauded by multiple commentators as a sign of market maturity, the flipside to this has been low trade volumes, which Hayes said he believes “could fall further from where they are now.”Nonetheless, BitMEX continues to see daily trades on crypto contracts worth a “notional $1 billion” per day, and recorded its highest ever day at $8.5 billion in 2018, notwithstanding the straitened climate. Hayes said the platform is “well positioned to weather the low volatility,” adding that:“There are some reports of other OTC dealers and exchanges letting go of employees because obviously volumes have fallen and they hired aggressively. Our expansion plans have not changed, we continue to hire across the whole organisation.”Yahoo’s report includes opinions from other industry experts, whose past experience has led them to draw a different prognosis to that of Hayes’. EToro senior analyst Mati Greenspan is quoted as saying:“In 2016 the gains started very gradually until it snowballed. Now that awareness and education have skyrocketed, I have a feeling that it’s going to happen a lot quicker the next time.”As reported last week, Bloomberg’s analysts have joined the ranks of experts who consider that Bitcoin (BTC)’s low volatility levels signal the coin is finding a bottom, viewing this as a positive sign in terms of fostering “uses cases […] other than speculation.”In October, Blockchain Capital’s Spencer Bogart concurred that Bitcoin appears to be “bottoming,” but anticipated a turning of the tables; nothing less than a “future crypto bonfire when we have the next bull market."""

These findings indicate that mineral mining, with the exception of aluminium and some oxides, draws less energy than crypto.Crypto mining power consumption compared to ‘real’ mining. Source: nature.comMoreover, the dataset for the study shows that energy consumption for three of four mentioned digital currencies — BTC, ETH and LTC — tends to grow from year to year. For instance, in 2016 BTC needed 17 MJ to generate one U.S. dollar, but now it consumes 19 MJ.The report states that the energy requirements per dollar will continue to increase. The scientists conclude that over the three years included in study, mining was responsible for 3–15 million tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.High energy consumption is considered by some to be an “Achilles Heel” for major cryptocurrencies. According to a February report, crypto mining in Iceland was expected consume more energy than households in 2018.In May, economist Alex de Vries, who published an article on “Bitcoin’s Growing Energy Problem,” claimed that BTC mining will use 0.5 percent of the world’s energy by 2018.However, U.S. clean energy expert Katrina Kelly later challenged those predictions, stating that the debate was “oversimplified.” Kelly noted that Iceland, for example, mostly relies on renewable sources of energy, meaning that bitcoins mined there would have a neutral carbon footprint."

In time, the company hopes he will be able to build upon his popularity even further, giving his global fanbase unprecedented access.In a news release announcing the signing, GCOX’s chief communications officer Evan Ngow said: “We are committed to assembling a diverse, multi-talented array of stars at GCOX, and Jason will certainly not be the last musician to join our ranks.”Several renowned names from the sporting world joined the platform prior to Derulo, including Filipino boxer turned politician Manny Pacquiao and former Liverpool striker Michael Owen, who were among the first to sign up to GCOX, making headlines internationally.Both Owen and Pacquiao are offering their own cryptocurrencies – known as OWN and PAC respectively – paving the way for fans to buy merchandise, make donations to good causes the athletes are passionate about, and unlock exclusive content.In its white paper, GCOX explains that its technology, built on the Acclaim blockchain, is designed to benefit celebrities at different points in their career. While newer public figures have the chance to increase their profile, catalyze their popularity and build a brand, established celebrities will be able to mobilise existing fans and sustain their momentum. ”Stars who are experiencing a decline in popularity will have the chance to recapture exposure and fame – “enhanc[ing], prolong[ing], and re-accelerat[ing] their career development.”According to GCOX, the services it offers to celebrities and their fans can be split into three specialised platforms.The first, “Celebreneur,” gives stars the impetus to be more entrepreneurial by providing them with an avenue to promote their existing businesses. Celebrities would also have a chance to sell their memorabilia, such as sporting paraphernalia or movie props, to their fans who want to own a slice of their history. Fans would also be able to be their own merchants and conduct their own transactions for their favorite celebrities’ memorabilia on the platform.The next platform is “Celeb-connect.” Here, celebrities have the chance to engage with their fanbase like never before, whether this involves sending birthday video greetings on social media or sharing a live-stream with fans using the respective celebrity’s tokens in exchange for such services.Finally, “Celeb-charity” allows the stars who are passionate about a certain good cause to raise awareness and boost fundraising.GCOX’s chief executive officer, Dr Jeffrey Lin, told Forbes India he was driven to develop the platform so fans would no longer have to fantasize about interacting with the celebrities they’ve come to admire. This vision originated from his childhood dream of being able to get up close and shake hands with music legend Michael Jackson.According to GCOX, it has a team of more than 60 people working in its enterprise. While they are mainly based in Singapore, some of its technical staff are located in Malaysia and Vietnam.Following on from a pre-initial token sale (ITS) the platform’s Acclaim and Applause tokens are being sold in three tranches – and GCOX says the first of these tranches was oversubscribed.The company is hoping to launch the ACCLAIM blockchain, and the GCOX exchange, in the third quarter of 2018. By the end of the year, it plans to have its Celeb-connect, Celeb-charity, and Celebreneur platforms open for business.Disclaimer. Cointelegraph does not endorse any content or product on this page.

The company believes its platform helps small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to compete with large corporations, without requiring large investments in technology and marketing.By now, Opporty has launched its platform’s localizations in China, the UK, Canada, the USA, and Australia. As the company reported to Cointelegraph, currently there are growing amount of providers on the platform. “Therefore, we observe that SMEs are ready to grow and benefit with Opporty, an online Marketplace that cares,” added the company’s representative.In the beginning of 2018, Opporty has acquired two new clients in New York. Both offer crypto payment options on their websites.Universal Accounting Systems, uses the company’s platform to allow its clients to pay with Bitcoin and Ethereum for tax preparation and other services. It uses Opporty’s smart widget to offer its clients a simple view of its services, and allows them to pay with cryptocurrency.Hudson Law Group, a midtown firm headed by David Treyster, has posted some customized crypto-based offerings for its clients using the Opporty marketplace. It also uses the smart widget and has already begun receiving crypto transactions through it.The company says, the amount of U.S.-based providers which registered on the platform has increased. The Australian version, which has recently been released, already has new providers that accept crypto payments, including OPP, the company’s token.The widgets by Opporty allow users to receive payments from customers. Companies that have listed their crypto-based offers at Opporty, ​get smart widgets on their websites​. Once the widget is placed, consumers can choose from several payment options, including ETH and BTC.“Small business owners now realize that cryptocurrencies can give them a head start over their competition,” Opporty founder Sergey Grybniak said in a release. Opporty enables anyone to use cryptocurrency, and the attendant benefits of blockchain, without having to master the underlying technology, the entrepreneur added.In March 2018, the Opporty team decided to implement ​Ethereum’s Plasma Protocol to “resolve the trust issues in business transactions and lack of privacy in traditional blockchain solutions.” The ​First backend version of Opporty’s Plasma solution allowed users to process around 5,000 transactions per second, the company said.“Then we have decided to come up with our own solution for ​Plasma Cash​, an enhancement technology for Plasma Protocol. After tireless work, our developers managed to enhance the technology​ to achieve the highest public test, which was more than Alipay at peak,” reported the Opporty team to Cointelegraph.Opporty’s B2B platform allows providers to list their offerings on the B2B services marketplace in a targeted manner, post requests for proposals, receive bids, and execute deals.The company claims that it resolves trust and sustainability problems between counterparties by storing business transaction data, including transaction quality, on the blockchain.

It exploded & ranked #4 in US investing category before mysteriously being taken down by @Apple. We had no warning. We don’t know why. They took down our podcast, but they can’t take down Bitcoin!”The podcast description for the episode that allegedly caused the podcast to rise in popularity last week – before being taken down by Apple – details that Pompliano interviewed Murad Mahmudov – described as one of the “highest conviction Bitcoin Maximalists in the world.”The episode hosts a discussion about “what Bitcoin is, how it works, the importance of its deflationary monetary system, why all Fiat Currencies are doomed to fail, and how central banks and institutions should be thinking about Bitcoin.”As of press time, searches for “Off the Chain” in the U.S. iTunes podcast store prompt an alert from Apple that the podcast is “not currently available.”“Off the Chain” podcast search results in the U.S. iTunes Store, Nov. 6In private correspondence with Cointelegraph, Pompliano provided a screenshot with what appears to be corroborating evidence of his claims that the podcast had sealed the 4th ranking for the investing category.

According to a Medium post published today, October 15, White will be joining as chief operating officer (COO) this November.","The news confirms unofficial reports that had already been circulating last week. As previously reported, Adam White was Coinbase’s fifth-ever employee, joining in 2013 when the founders “were still working out of a one-bedroom apartment and Bitcoin was trading around $200,” and staying with the firm for five years as it grew to its current popularity.In tandem with today’s Medium announcement, the new COO has spoken with Fortune about his reasons for making the move, saying he believes that ICE’s new venture will be the catalyst for those institutional investors that have been “waiting on the sidelines” to enter the crypto space. He is quoted as saying that:“In 2017, I saw a big shift. The interest in Bitcoin and other currencies started changing from retail to the institutional side. But the level of infrastructure of the existing trading sites often didn’t meet their expectations.”White went on to tell Fortune that he believes traditional banking giants have been waiting for crypto trading security standards to reach the mark of more traditional markets such as equities or bonds, claiming “that’s why I joined Bakkt.”Fortune’s interview also covered White’s perspective on this year’s protracted crypto bear market, arguing that what matters is an increase in daily transactions for cryptocurrencies year-to-year, as well as new protocols for open source software developers.As previously reported, ICE — the operator of 23 leading global exchanges including the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) — unveiled its plans to create Bakkt, a “seamless” global ecosystem for digital assets, this August.Today’s official post notes that the firm is focusing “on mitigating risk while creating opportunities for institutions,” outlining several details of its proposed “conservative market design,” and emphasizing that “commingling, leverage and rehypothecation” will not be features of its offering.One of Bakkt’s most anticipated offerings include plans to offer a one-day physically delivered Bitcoin (BTC) contract, subject to pending approval from US regulators.In late August, the firm had already emphasized it would not be support margin trading for its BTC contract, as reaffirmed today."

Litecoin trading will reportedly go live Tuesday, October 16th at 9:30 am EDT.The coin is set to be the fourth crypto supported on the platform, alongside Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Zcash (ZEC). Consequently, LTC trading pairs will be available against all three cryptos, as well as against the U.S. dollar.Winer’s post underscores Gemini’s thoroughgoing “banking compliance and fiduciary obligations” under oversight from the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). It notes that Litecoin trading support comes as the result of close cooperation with the watchdog, and that the exchange continues to expand with a “security-first” approach.Lastly, the post reveals that support for Bitcoin Cash (BCH) had also been slated for today. However, due to high levels of “uncertainty” within the Bitcoin Cash community about “one or more possible hard forks” planned for mid-November, Gemini has decided to delay its support of the asset:“Some of [the] forks [currently under discussion] lack the replay protection feature that would be required for Gemini to safely support Bitcoin Cash. Because of this situation, we are delaying our launch of Bitcoin Cash deposits, withdrawals, and trading until late November, after the forks have passed and we can evaluate the health of the Bitcoin Cash ecosystem.”Earlier this month, Gemini announced it had secured insurance coverage for custodied digital assets from lending services firm Aon, which will complement its already available Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) coverage for U.S. dollar deposits.The Winklevoss twins have also recently sealed the approval of the NYDFS to launch their own U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin, the Gemini dollar, the same day as U.S. Trust company Paxos announced its own NYDFS-approved stablecoin.Shortly after the news, the brothers reportedly started to hire advisors to oversee Gemini’s potential expansion to the U.K. market.As of press time, Gemini is ranked the world’s 38th largest crypto exchange by CoinMarketCap, seeing over $34 million in daily traded volumes."

Following the complaints, the Istanbul police launched an investigation against a group of hackers that had allegedly compromised users’ emails, crypto wallets’ accounts data, and passwords.On Oct. 26, cybercrime unit agents detained 11 people in multiple locations in Istanbul as a result of joint raids with special operations department Harekat police. Ten suspects were taken into custody, with one of them reportedly released on the condition of then remaining under further “judicial control.” Police have also seized from the alleged hackers two fake identity cards, as well as a number of devices allegedly used in the hacks such as 18 mobile phones and SIM cards, 22 memory sticks, and other items.According to Turkish prosecutors, the amount of stolen Bitcoin is worth around 437,000 Turkish lira, or more than $80,000. The group of attackers allegedly moved the stolen crypto to multiple accounts in an attempt to cover their tracks before subsequently selling it for fiat.During the investigation, the cybercrime unit identified some suspects by tracking new SIM card numbers registered to crypto exchange accounts by the hackers. Police agents also tracked the suspects who tried to withdraw the stolen assets from ATMs and banks based on records by multiple security cameras. The article says that the investigation is ongoing, with policemen looking for more victims of the hackers.In August this year, Cointelegraph reported on the Turkish lira’s collapse, triggering more interest by the Turkish people in buying decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC). The lira dropped by 50 percent against the U.S. dollar by August 2018, seeing the all-time lows due to geopolitical factors.On Aug. 22, police in California detained an alleged hacker who stole Bitcoin worth more than $1 million by hijacking cellphones.

See, I don’t want to be president. I couldn’t be...no one’s going to elect me president, please God. However, I’ve got the right to run.”McAfee first announced his intention to run for U.S. president in 2020 in order to support the crypto community and promote crypto in early June, 2018.In the interview today, McAfee also reiterated his prediction from last-year that top cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) will hit $1 million by the year of the U.S. president elections. However, McAfee clarified that that amount of U.S. dollars will not be the same $1 million that we have today, since fiat currencies will logically flee to crypto markets, adding confidently:“In five years time fiat will be on its last legs.”The upcoming U.S. presidential run will be not the first one for McAfee ,who sought the Libertarian Party nomination in 2016. McAfee has since claimed that if he “been more connected with the community in 2016,” he would even have better promoted the idea of “currency independence.”As he said in the interview today, back in his 2016 run, he focused on “lapses in cyber security.”In June 2018, McAfee announced on Twitter that he would stop  promoting Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) due to “threats” from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

In one proposed setup, the enterprise account itself would be able to conduct transactions on customers’ behalf, debiting or crediting the customer accounts in question as appropriate.To this end, the patent outlines methods for storing private keys associated with customers’ accounts, determining public keys, and generating “vault keys” for storage.In other instances, the patent suggests that aggregating customer crypto deposits in an enterprise account could “negate” the need for the enterprise’s customers to use a third-party exchange to convert currency, thereby “simplifying the purchase and exchange of currencies and cryptocurrencies and reducing the fees associated with doing so.”To achieve this end, the filing outlines an example in which an enterprise cryptocurrency server could communicate over a network with a third-party cryptocurrency exchange server (giving OKCoin and Bitstamp as examples).The document also deals with tackling crypto-fiat conversions, outlining that the system would be able to “determine a plurality of exchange rates associated with converting the first currency into the second currency and determine an optimal exchange rate,” initiating an “essentially simultaneous” conversion.As previously reported, the Bank of America has filed over 50 blockchain- and cryptocurrency-related patents to date, even as it maintains a publicly critical stance toward decentralized crypto assets such as Bitcoin (BTC).The bank’s most recent crypto-related patent award, which was sealed Oct. 30, referenced storage methods for private keys, with the perspective that current systems for ensuring they remain untampered are inadequate."

According to the website, the company provides consulting services for those who are new to crypto trading.Earlier in October, the FMA had blacklisted several other crypto-related companies. Fix Club Limited, a crypto trading platform, was mentioned because of false claims that it belonged to the New Zealand regulated crypto area. Bitcoin Revolution Trading was listed for reportedly claiming that country’s current or former prime ministers and Treasury officials were investing in Bitcoin (BTC).As Cointelegraph previously wrote, rumors spread on social media in late 2017 that former New Zealand Prime Minister Sir John Key held $300 mln in BTC from his initial investment of $1,000. However, Key denied all the allegations, revealing that the initial piece was posted by a fake website pretending to be the New Zealand Herald — the largest newspaper in country.New Zealand’s police have also warned citizens about crypto-related online scams in September, shortly after an investor lost $320,000 NZD ($213,000 USD) to crypto fraudsters. “Members of the public should seek advice before making any online investments they are unsure of,” the police sergeant said at the time."

And there are also, I am afraid, outright scandals and frauds.”The latest proposals pertain to any fund managers investing more than 10 percent of their holdings in cryptocurrency, with entities serving exclusively professional traders able to join a sandbox scheme designed to give more room to develop new products and services.For others, a licensing process will require entities to inform the SFC about their business practices.The statement reads:“In order to afford better protection to investors, the SFC considers that all licensed portfolio managers intending to invest in virtual assets should observe essentially the same regulatory requirements even if the portfolios (or portions of portfolios) under their management invest solely or partially in virtual assets, irrespective of whether these virtual assets amount to ‘securities’ or ‘futures contracts.’”Cryptocurrency exchanges could also fall under the the SFC’s supervision more directly in future.“...It is proposed that the standards of conduct regulation for virtual asset trading platform operators should be comparable to those applicable to existing licensed providers of automated trading services,” it adds.Hong Kong’s sharpening of its regulatory oversight comes while more and more jurisdictions move to do the same, as Bitcoin and major altcoin markets stabilize and a general acceptance of their longevity begins to crystalize.Last week, Taiwan announced it would release dedicated rules governing Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) by June next year, having previously chosen not to regulate the sector."

specialized computers for the energy-intensive activity. #Bitcoin · # ...","Nov 9, 2018","Canadian blockchain and cryptocurrency company DMG Blockchain Solutions Inc. has energized its new crypto mining facility, according to an announcement published Nov. 8. DMG states that the facility will start at 60 megawatts, and can expand its capacity up to 85 megawatts.","DMG Blockchain Solutions initially revealed its plans to launch the station in July, stating that  their crypto mining operation will be implemented on an industrial scale with direct support from the local government and electricity providers. The station will purportedly increase DMG’s hosting capability by more than 20 times.Per the recent statement, the 27,000 square foot crypto mining-as-a-service (MaaS) operation occupies an area of 34 acres and is one of the biggest such operations in North America. Since the facility uses hydroelectric power — of which there is a surplus in Canada — the operation will reportedly not affect power needs of local residents.Independence from the local community grid is crucial for the project’s success, as DMG’s new 85 megawatt facility requires the same amount of electricity needed to power 50,000 homes. Dave Evdokimoff, CEO of local electrical products and services company Boundary Electric, said that “in Boundary Electric’s 71 years of business, we have never seen a demand in the electrical manufacturing industry quite like what is being generated from the crypto space.”Due to an abundance of hydroelectricity and low power costs, Canada has become an attractve location for cryptocurrency mining. In June, major Canadian electricity provider Hydro-Québec proposed new rules, under which blockchain companies will be required to bid for electricity and quantify the jobs and investment they expect to generate per megawatt.With that move, Hydro-Québec seeks to allocate up to 500 megawatts, in addition to 120 megawatts of already existing initiatives. The power supplier purportedly received requests to purchase power from more than 100 organizations with a total energy consumption exceeding 10 terawatt hours.The U.S. state of New York is also flush with hydropower, as earlier this summer state regulators approved a new electricity rate scheme for crypto miners that will allow them to negotiate contracts. The Massena municipal utility will consider contracts on a case-by-case basis, which will protect other utility customers from increased rates.Residential consumers in Massena pay an energy charge of about $0.039 per kilowatt hour, where the national average residential rate is $0.13 per kilowatt hour. This made the state a destination for crypto miners, who use powerful specialized computers for the energy-intensive activity."

Days’",https://cointelegraph.com/news/ex-fed-prosecutor-turned-crypto-vc-katie-haun-crypto-is-in-the-dial-up-days,"Nobel-winning economist and notorious Bitcoin critic Paul Krugman debates 
ex-U.S. federal prosecutor and crypto bull Kathryn Haun.","Nov 5, 2018","Former U.S. federal prosecutor and current cryptocurrency VC executive Kathryn Haun recently took part in a debate on crypto with Nobel-prize winning economist Paul Krugman, posted on YouTube by crypto venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) Nov. 2.","The debate, hosted by Mexican tech company KIO Networks and moderated by local business journalist Rodrigo Pacheco, was reportedly held in Mexico in September 2018.A former federal prosecutor for the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) and current general partner at a16z, Haun was representing the optimistic approach towards crypto-related technologies. Krugman, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences in 2008, held his previous negative position on the topic, debating with Haun as a crypto skeptic.In her preliminary speech that preceded the debate, Haun, who is also a board member at major crypto exchange and wallet service Coinbase, compared the current stage of cryptocurrency evolution to the early years of Internet:""We're in the dial-up days [of crypto], and the critics out there confuse the current state of innovation with the end state of it.""Krugman opposed that point of view, reminding the audience that Bitcoin (BTC) had been on the stage for ten years already, and arguing that the prospects of using it as a payment method were still unclear. The Graduate Center of the City University of New York (CUNY) Professor of Economics noted that at the initial stage of web there clearly were things one could not do without the internet, such as storing newspapers online. However, Krugman opined, crypto hasn’t shown such advantages so far:“There is very little sign that BTC is becoming any kind of widespread means of payment, and that’s ten years on, so when is it going to happen?”Haun for her part stressed that BTC reached a mass audience quite a bit later than when Satoshi Nakamoto released the Bitcoin whitepaper — pointing to the years 2012-2013 as when digital currencies became somewhat more broadly know.Haun also reminded the audience that many people still tended to believe in myths about crypto and crime, which have slowed down mass adoption of the technology.During the debate, Krugman cast doubt on the very nature of cryptocurrencies, calling the fact that there is no authority to prove their authenticity a point of weakness. In response to that, Haun said that fiat currencies were also easy to counterfeit, while global governments do not have the resources to fully prevent such crimes.Despite their contrary stances, both participants seemed to agree that blockchain and crypto would not necessarily fully undermine or destroy existing systems. For his part, Krugman argued that blockchain had not found a use case to rival existing centralized services, like Amazon:“I don’t think blockchain will undermine Amazon or any of these people. I use Amazon not because the power of it, but because of laziness [...] Money is all about the power of laziness, you don’t have to think too much about what the thing is. It’s a dollar, so I can use it.”Haun spoke to the fact that crypto could exist without fully replacing fiat money:“I don’t think cryptocurrencies will replace all of the other currencies, such as euro and dollar. I also don’t believe it is going to replace gold as a store of value entirely [...] I think it will develop as an alternative store of value.”As Cointelegraph has previously reported, Haun was introduced to crypto and blockchain during her time in government when she worked as a prosecutor on the  Silk Road case. This spring, Haun stated that she doubts cryptocurrencies and blockchain will see relevant regulation in the near future, due to the rate of development in the industry.Krugman, in his turn, has previously called the collapse of crypto “a real possibility,” claiming that crypto enthusiasts are “effectively celebrating the use of cutting-edge technology to set the monetary system back 300 years.” He has been repeatedly criticized for his unapologetically negative stance on Bitcoin by members of the crypto community."

Youbing,” (“why insane” in Mandarin), as she tried to survive using ...","Nov 12, 2018","Next month marks the fifth-anniversary of the People Bank of China (PBoC)’s very first crypto regulatory intervention, with the issuance of its ‘Notice on Precautions Against the Risks of Bitcoin’ in Dec. 2013. Over the years, the Chinese authorities have cemented an increasingly hardline stance, as their perception of the financial risks posed by crypto has hardened.","Their action has spanned the notorious criminalization of initial coin offerings (ICOs) in Sept. 2017, followed by a series of stark measures that target crypto trading platforms, third-party crypto payment channels, social media networks, and offline crypto-promotional events.Just this month, the PBoC announced it had widened its regulatory scrutiny to include token airdrops, which it characterized as “disguised” ICOs in its latest annual financial stability report.Days later, the central bank issued a working paper advising that the government strengthen its supervision of “speculation, market manipulation and other irregularities,” which it claimed are common in domestic blockchain-related financing and investment schemes. This echoed prior PBoC warnings against fraudulent whitepapers and crypto investment projects that masquerade as “blockchain innovation,” signalling the central bank’s intent to continue to ratchet up measures against the crypto industry, in what it perceives to be its manifold ‘guises.’Cointelegraph’s three-part series on the history of cryptocurrencies in China opened with the conundrum of how it is possible that, despite this ever-escalating onslaught of harsh rhetoric and iron-fisted interventions, the use of crypto for various transactions remains possible; popular Twitter-based Chinese crypto news source cnLedger pins a post to the top of its profile that shows a domestic retailer openly accepting payments in Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), or Bitcoin Cash (BCH) for a glitzy McLaren sports car.As a further indication of this apparent anomaly, three stories broke this fall that epitomized the uneven nature of China’s crypto landscape.On September 30, 2018, the Beijing Sci-Tech Report (BSTR), the country’s longest-running tech journal, announced it would be launching subscriptions payable in Bitcoin (BTC), offering its “Tech Life” magazine at an annual cost of 0.01 BTC, approximately $65. In response to bemused readers, local crypto news source cnLedger clarified that “owning and investing in crypto is not banned,” claiming:“Otherwise Jihan [Wu, CEO] of Bitmain and Leon [Li, CEO] of Huobi would be among the first ones to get fined/caught. Thousands if not millions would have been arrested already (large amount of OTC tradings).”While BTSR pitched its subscription as a way of “promoting blockchain science through practical actions,” a distinctly less utilitarian approach was taken that same week by a luxury hotel in the country’s southwestern Sichuan Province. On September 24, the newly-opened “Ethereum Hotel,” claimed to be China’s “first” hotel to Ethereum (ETH) as payment, with local reporters remarking that the move was proof that advanced technologies “have penetrated the hinterland of China.”China’s “first” hotel to accept payment in ether. Source: jinse.comThe hotel’s setting in the scenic Aba Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture (Aba was reportedly selected as being one of the top 220 top Chinese “cities with charm”) is indeed perhaps an unlikely spot to test the authorities’ response to the acceptance of currency that is deemed not to be legal tender, yet whose use has not unequivocally been declared illegal.While it remains moot whether the September 4, 2017 stipulation that crypto should not “be used in the market as currency” could potentially be extrapolated to bar retailers’ acceptance in future, some in the local crypto community are evidently aware of the relative freedom that for now still obtains on legal grounds.Testing the waters, a multi-episode documentary produced by a group of self-described crypto enthusiasts dubbed “Team 1234” this fall showed the results of a 21-day experiment to see whether it would be possible to survive using only crypto in China. The documentary, “Bitcoin Girl,” followed a girl whose online avatar is “He Youbing,” (“why insane” in Mandarin), as she tried to survive using Bitcoin holdings worth around $1,400 at the start of her trip on Aug. 28.After she reportedly passed out and was hospitalized because of low blood sugar in Beijing — having had to survive on free ketchup at a local McDonald’s —the group acknowledged the inadequate infrastructure for mass crypto use in the country; a stark contrast to China’s strong reputation as a “cashless” society, due to the burgeoning popularity of consumer payment apps such as Alipay and WeChat Pay.“If I fail, then that’s the failure of the blockchain people,” He Youbing remarked in the midst of her trials. Nonetheless, she scored small victories in the southern Chinese coastal city of Shenzhen, using Bitcoin to dine on crayfish at a local seafood joint, and also sold her Bitcoin to an amenable yoga teacher, using the proceeds to recuperate for a night at a hotel.He Youbing during her 21-day experiment for the documentary “Bitcoin Girl.” Source: China DailyIf aspects of crypto’s future in China remain uncertain, the more liberal past has proved to be fertile soil for China-born innovators to lay the foundations for their future fortunes: thirteen of the wealthiest people in China as of October 2018 were reported to be crypto entrepreneurs.To seal a spot on the rankings, known as the annual Hurun report, an individual must have a personal net worth of at least 2 billion yuan, or $289 million. Among them, 39-year old Micree Zhan Ketuan, co-founder of Bitmain Technologies, was ranked 95th wealthiest in the country; his colleague, Jihan Wu, 204th.OkCoin’s Star Xu, Binance's CZ, Huobi founder Li Lin and Bitcoin whale Li Xiaolai all made an appearance on the rich list.While China’s mainland restrictions may in retrospect have paradoxically accelerated the burgeoning wealth of its exiled crypto exchange tycoons — prompting platforms to successfully expand their services overseas under duress — exporters of crypto mining gear now face a hurdle that is for once not related to the domestic regulatory noose.In the sabre-rattling Trump era of a “trade war” with China, Bitmain, Ebang and Canaan all now face tariffs on their US shipments of a stark 27.6 percent, following a reclassification of their mining hardware as “electrical machinery apparatus”  by the office of the U.S. Trade Representative this June.Erstwhile zero-fee exports under a “data processing machine” classification are no longer possible since the tariff code change took effect this August, threatening to erode the competitive edge of the mining moguls.With the domestic mining industry thus shaken by the impact of both the crypto bear market and of geopolitical shifts in international trade — and after a summer of the authorities’ redoubled efforts to stifle crypto trading — the environment for the local crypto industry is hardly auspicious.Yet on one point, China’s judiciary has this year provided some positive clarity, setting precedents for domestic law to uphold the rights of crypto owners. Property rights still apply, as a district civil dispute case encapsulated this summer, when a Shanghai court ruled in favor of an ICO operator in the context of an unjust enrichment case.  The case, tried at the Shanghai Hongkou District Court on June 27, 2018, involved a plaintiff described as a Beijing-headquartered “tech company” that is reported to have raised both Ether (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) in its August 2017 token sale.In the fall out of the September 2017 ICO ban, the company promptly set out to refund investors’ holdings, as had been stipulated by the government’s orders, yet mistakenly transferred 20 ETH to the wrong man due to so-called “operational errors.”The man, identified only as Chen, was sued by the company after he failed to respond to requests that the wrongly transferred 20 ETH be returned. Chen had attempted to defend his position by pointing to the fact that Ether, as other cryptocurrencies, is not recognized as legal tender in China, and that its circulation was subject to severe restrictions in the country.While the court conceded the defendant’s points, it nonetheless deemed that Ether remains protected under the China’s property law, and that crypto-related unjust enrichment cases therefore persist under civil law, as long as the plaintiff can provide proof of a digital chain of custody to the court.Given the pseudonymous nature of blockchain-based transactions, the court noted that adequate proof of the identities involved may encounter “obstacles at the prosecution stage,” and outlined alternative forms of proof that a plaintiff can legitimately use in order to prove the relationship between a blockchain wallet account and the defendant’s person.The Shanghai precedent was reaffirmed on October 25, 2018, when the Shenzhen Court of International Arbitration ruled in favor of a plaintiff in an equity transfer dispute, in which the defendant failed to return holdings of Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Bitcoin Diamond (BCD) as had been agreed upon in a contractual agreement.The contract had authorized the defendant to trade and manage the plaintiff’s portfolio of 20.13 BTC, 50 BCH, and 12.66 BCD for a stipulated time. When the defendant failed to return the holdings as per the agreed schedule, the plaintiff brought the case before the arbitrator, seeking the return of his assets with interest.The defendant countered the plaintiff, arguing that the core “payment and arrangement of the transfer price” clause of the contract was in violation of the mandatory provisions of Chinese law, which prohibits the sale and circulation of crypto tokens, as well as the trading platforms used as a venue for their transfer and exchange.The arbitrator however found that the contractual obligation under dispute did not fall under the relevant provisions as outlined in the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) Sept. 2017 prohibition, stating that:“There is no law or regulation that explicitly prohibits parties from holding Bitcoin or making private transactions in Bitcoin, [only warnings to] the public about the investment risks.”The arbitrator continued to outline that “the contract in this case stipulates the obligation to return the Bitcoin between two natural persons,” and does not therefore fall under the jurisdiction of the September 2017 ban.The latter expressly pertains to ICOs whose “irregular sale and circulation of tokens” is deemed to be “unauthorized” and “illegal” public financing, and determines that crypto “cannot and should not be circulated nor used in the market as currency.”The arbitrator concluded that the contract was legally binding, affirming that crypto can legally be privately held and transferred, and ordering the assets’ return, noting that:""Bitcoin has the nature of a property, which can be owned and controlled by parties, and is able to provide economic values and benefits.""Over the past five years, the deep ideological rift between the decentralizing ethos of cryptocurrencies and China’s economic and political system has led the authorities to adopt an ever more-adversarial stance. The perception that the cornerstone principles of the crypto revolution — disintermediation and the frictionless circulation of value — will undercut the government’s strict capital controls and economic strategy has translated into a series of attempts to insulate both the financial system and individual investors from the global crypto space.This, as many had presciently forecast, has been something of a “pyrrhic victory,” as investors continue to devise means of circumventing restrictions. Statistics indicate that China’s share of global Bitcoin trading has nonetheless drastically spiralled downwards as a result of the government’s war on crypto, and the central bank’s by-now familiar rhetoric warning against “illegal fundraising,” “financial fraud,” and “pyramid schemes” shows little sign of abating.Yet the breakneck pace set by technological innovation could mean that a new, as yet unimagined chapter for crypto in China, will open in future. Experiments such as “Bitcoin Girl” show the appetite for change is there, and domestic crypto investors have to date indicated they will use every means available in their arsenal — from VPNs to over-the-counter (OTC) trades —  to preserve their autonomy and reinvent the future of the space.This is part three of a three-part series on crypto regulation in China, read part one - here, and part two – here."

Unsurprisingly, those who had been tipped off, immediately swamped Coinbase and the GDAX with buy and sell orders, thinning the liquidity but obtaining BCH at fair prices.”This, the class action had alleged, “unfairly dr[o]ve up the price of BCH for non-insider traders once BCH came on line on the Coinbase exchange.”In his response to the complaint, District Judge Chhabria found that:“Berk fails to describe the scope or content of Coinbase’s duty in anything more than broad generalities. A reader of the Complaint is thus left wondering what Coinbase should have done differently, or why the rollout of Bitcoin Cash would have gone more smoothly had Coinbase done whatever Berk thinks is appropriate.”Therefore, “[w]ith one exception,” the judge dismissed the class action without prejudice, leaving Berk and his legal representatives with 21 days to file an amended complaint.The single exception referred to Berk’s claim under the Commodity Exchange Act, which the judge stated would have had enforcement jurisdiction only if Berk’s private claim had involved the purchase of a futures contract, rather than a commodity such as BCH. The judge therefore dismissed the claim with prejudice.This week, a New York judge also dismissed an investor’s proposed class action lawsuit against the developers of altcoin Nano (XRB). The class action case had accused the alt’s core dev team of violating U.S. securities laws and negligently misrepresenting the reliability of Italian crypto exchange BitGrail, from which around 17 million XRB ($187 million at the time) was stolen in February."

... of Bitcoin and Ethereum from a draft bill on digital currency 
regulation ...","Nov 17, 2018","On November 7, the chairman of Russia’s State Duma Committee on Financial Markets announced details of the “CryptoRuble,” a long-discussed government cryptocurrency project.  ","Specifically, the official said that a state-backed stablecoin would be a complete equivalent to the Russian fiat ruble, but in a digital space. Russian authorities have now ended up with this concept after years of contradicting statements, and still, a ruble-pegged stablecoin might not turn out stable in the end.Russian national cryptocurrency was originally referred to as “Bitruble,” but then the term “CryptoRuble” became more common in the media.The history of CryptoRuble could be traced back to the fall of 2015, when a Moscow-based online payment settlement system, WebMoney, and Cyprus-headquartered payment service provider, Qiwi, separately approached the Central Bank of Russia (CBR) and offered to issue a state-controlled digital currency in the country.Both proposals were vigorously denied by the government. Specifically, the Russian Ombudsman, Pavel Medvedev, called Qiwi’s suggestion “technical hooliganism” that is “illegal” and “absolutely inappropriate.”“The Constitution says who has the right in Russia to issue money; it is the [Russian] central bank. The only currency in Russia is the ruble. The rest of the money is illegal, and this kind of disgrace [would be] a criminal offense.”However, the Russian government’s views towards “CryptoRuble” have been considerably inconsistent to this date. Thus, in May 2016, Russian newspaper Kommersant reported that local officials were discussing the concept of a national cryptocurrency that would “minimize the amount of anonymous transactions,” citing the Assistant Director at Russia’s Federal Financial Monitoring Service (Rosfinmonitoring), Pavel Livadniy.On June 2, 2017, the CBR announced it was developing a national cryptocurrency. “We will definitely get to a national digital cryptocurrency. We have already started working on it,” CBR’s deputy chairwoman, Olga Skorobogatova, told news agency Ria Novosti.Several days later, on June 5, the head of the CBR, Elvira Nabiullina, elaborated on Skorobogatova’s statement, adding that a national cryptocurrency was not the agency’s top priority. Nabiullina called it “a medium-term, or, perhaps, a long-term” plan, however.In October, 2017, President Vladimir Putin claimed that cryptocurrencies “cause serious risk” and are used for crime, as the CBR said it would block websites selling Bitcoin and altcoins. Just a month prior to that, Russia’s Finance Minister, Anton Siluanov, argued that the authorities had to accept the idea of the digital currencies market:“There is no sense in banning them, there is a need to regulate them.”Also in October 2017, local news media, Argumenti i Fakti (AiF), reported that Putin “gave a direct order” to develop the “cryptoruble.” The news article quoted Minister of Communications, Nikolay Nikiforov, as its source. Nikiforov also reportedly mentioned specifics of the national cryptocurrency for the first time. According to the official, the “CryptoRuble” could not be mined; and it could be exchanged for regular rubles at any time (though if the holder is unable to explain where the CryptoRubles came from, a 13 percent tax will be levied). The same tax would be applied to any profit made from trading the token. Nikiforov said:“I confidently declare that we run CryptoRuble for one simple reason: if we do not, then after two months our neighbors in the EurAsEC [The Eurasian Economic Community] will.”However, that report was not confirmed by mainstream media, and it is still unclear if Putin gave his approval for the above mentioned concept. As soon as next month, in November 2017, Nikiforov argued that the term “CryptoRuble” was “quite incorrect,” and suggested calling it “a digital token.”In December 2017, the government news agency, TASS, reported on a recent meeting dedicated to the legislation for digital currencies in the country. The article argued that both the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank of Russia were skeptical about issuing a national cryptocurrency.On Jan. 1, 2018, the Financial Times reported on another government meeting, where Sergei Glazyev, economic adviser to President Putin, allegedly argued that the CryptoRuble could help relieve the pressure of Western sanctions. Later, the concept will be picked up by countries like Iran and Venezuela, who also aim to use their national cryptocurrency to bypass such penalties.However, there was still no unified official stance from the Russian government on the matter of issuing a national digital currency. And the indecisiveness continued.A few weeks later in the same month, the Russian Association of Cryptocurrency and Blockchain (RACIB) announced that the CryptoRuble will be launched in the middle of 2019. According to Arseniy Sheltsin, the head of RACIB, details of the project will be officially presented and discussed in July 2018, while the coin itself should be issued a year later.In June 2018, Putin claimed that Russia cannot have its own cryptocurrency, as cryptocurrency “by definition” cannot be owned by a centralized state, since it “goes beyond borders.”After a long back and forth on the topic within the Russian government, the cryptoruble finally morphed into a more concrete concept.On Nov. 2, 2018, the chairman of Russia’s State Duma Committee on Financial Markets, Anatoly Aksakov, said that his agency is considering the launch of state-backed cryptocurrency pegged to the Russian ruble.The official expressed his confidence that the government will back such cryptocurrency, clarifying that “it will be a ruble-pegged cryptocurrency.” The deputy also added that the implied coin will represent a blockchain-powered stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the ruble.Aksakov further described the model of creating the stablecoin, stating that the cryptocurrency will be backed by a banking deposit of a certain amount. After that, a banking institution is set to issue a corresponding amount of crypto assets by using blockchain and adhering to the 1:1 proportion.The chairman also clarified that the cryptocurrency will be issued by the central bank since it is backed by fiat currency. In conclusion, Aksakov noted that the implementation of blockchain technology in terms of the issuance of “crypto-money” is “promising.”Interestingly, Aksakov is the same official who erased all mention of Bitcoin and Ethereum from a draft bill on digital currency regulation ahead of its reading in the State Duma in October 2018. He explained the move by saying “we decided we don’t need them, those ambiguous Bitcoins.”On November 7, Aksakov provided even more detail regarding the national-issued stablecoin. Specifically, he said that the “cryptoruble,” which may appear after the adoption of laws regulating the cryptocurrency industry in Russia (which are also consistently changed and delayed), would be “the same ruble, just in encrypted form.” The State Duma chairman explained that it would be possible to change the Russian stablecoin for the equivalent in fiat money:""For example, you bring 100 thousand rubles to a bank and get 100 thousand crypto rubles, one to one for fiat money. You use these funds to buy goods fixed in the blockchain.”Aksakov also underlined that the crypto ruble — “the ruble in blockchain” — would replace the fiat ruble “as soon as the blockchain begins to occupy a significant place in our economy.” He did not specify what type of blockchain that was, however. Previously, Minister of Communications Nikiforov argued that the “CryptoRuble” should be based on a locally-developed technology.Issuing a stablecoin that is pegged to the Russian ruble might seem somewhat questionable from an economic perspective, as the currency has not shown consistent growth, or even stability over the past years. On the contrary, it has been on constant decline since the political tension between Russia and the West intensified in 2014.  More specifically, the price of the ruble plummeted on Dec. 16, 2014. The “Russia Trading System” (RTS) Index, denominated in U.S. dollars, fell 12%, the most on any given day since the midst of the global financial crisis in 2008. On December 15, Russian gold and foreign currencies reserves were reduced by ""U.S. $15.7 billion, to below U.S. $400 billion, for the first time since August 2009,"" as the government began fighting its “worst financial crisis since 1998,” as per Reuters.It happened mainly due to two factors: first, the price of oil — the commodity upon which the Russian economy is largely built — began to fall sharply, forcing the CBR to raise interest rates by a hefty 650 basis points. Secondly, strict Western sanctions imposed against Russian companies that have been rolled out in response to Russia’s annexation of Crimea earlier in 2014, have played their role in the ruble’s dramatic fall as well.The ruble crash had a significant impact on the Russian economy — as a result of the fall, local people were financially challenged. Annual inflation climbed to more than 10 percent. Prices of goods, including beef and fish, rose 40 to 50 percent within a few months before the end of the year, due to Russia's ban on Western imports — the government’s countermeasure to the U.S. and European sanctions. Car sales fell by 12 percent, comparing to the previous year.The situation somewhat stabilized over the next couple of years, but ruble to U.S. dollars rates have remained high since. The local ban on Western imports stayed as well, considerably limiting Russians’ consumer behavior.In August this year, the situation was somewhat repeated once again, although to a smaller degree. Russia’s ruble fell to 69.40 against the dollar, its lowest level in two years. The CBR blamed the slide in the ruble’s value on new U.S. sanctions introduced by the Congress over a chemical-weapon attack in Salisbury and reports on Russia’s interference in the U.S. presidential elections in 2016.If a ruble-pegged cryptocurrency is given a green light from Russian authorities after a years-long exchange of contradicting comments, the “cryptoruble” price could be doomed to go through unexpected, politics-driven price spikes."

But right now it [crypto] is more of a commodity than a payment vehicle.”While competing global payment giant Mastercard just received a patent for a using fractional reserve banking principles to combine “blockchain currencies” and fiat for payments, Visa’s CEO pointed out that Visa is a “much bigger network” than Mastercard.According to Kelly, Mastercard has to “try harder,” because they are “smaller than [Visa].”Visa has also recently moved towards crypto’s underlying technology, blockchain, with their announcement this week of a blockchain-based identity system for cross-border payments.While both MasterCard and Visa have made multiple moves into the blockchain industry, it was recently reported that both companies are planning to classify crypto and Initial Coin Offering (ICO) within a new “high risk” category."

Winklevoss Converted His Biographer Into a Bitcoin Believer.","Oct 30, 2018", ,"The ADAB Solutions project, based in the United Arab Emirates, is planning to launch FICE — the First Islamic Crypto Exchange which will be operating “according to the principles of Shariah law.” The company is expecting to reach $146 million daily trading and $4.4 billion monthly turnover by 2020.The new project hasn’t been launched yet but it has already gotten the attention of the crypto community. The First Islamic Crypto Exchange was marked as number one in a recently published Coin Shark rating “TOP 10 ICO Projects That Became the Most Useful Ideas of 2018.” The company says their product is an “opportunity for the crypto market to enter the Islamic world” and that it will be the “world's first cryptocurrency exchange that will operate in full compliance with the principles of Islamic finance.”That means there will be two special departments to control how the platform works. FICE will have a special Department of Islamic Finance and a Shariah Advisory Board in its structure. The Shariah Advisory Board will unite famous Islamic financial experts who will analyze and confirm that each of the cryptocurrencies which will be listed on FICE are “halal”, so Muslim clients which wish to use their services can rely on this estimation. According to ADAB Solutions, the difference between conventional and Islamic exchange platforms is that there will also be no speculations or market manipulation by FICE.Experts report a constant rise in Islamic finance over the last decade. In September 2018, Daily News wrote that the annual growth of this market is 10-12 percent over the past 10 years. Moreover, the analytics from Thomson Reuters in July 2018 estimated the value of Islamic finance as $2.2 trillion. They also noted that the industry is spread over more than 60 countries. The experts predict Islamic finance to grow to $3.8 trillion by 2022.According to the Pew Research Center, there are 1.8 billion Muslims in the world and this number is growing every year. That’s why ADAB Solutions believe that they’ve chosen the best time to create First Islamic Crypto Exchange. “The idea of FICE is really relevant and needed” —  the company said.ADAB Solutions offers users to buy their own ADAB tokens during the ICO that was launched in August 2018 and will be held until February 2019. The cost of Islamic digital currency is $ 0.1 and the company expects the coin’s value to increase to $11.5 by the end of 2022. The ADAB token can be used for paying the commission on all transactions within the platform. The company also promises to automatically burn 10 percent of each commission that it receives in order to reduce the number of tokens and increase its value.ADAB Solutions expects to attract around 730,000 people after the launch of the project in 2019. The team plans to increase this number by almost three times and reach a 1.9 million audience in 2022, including Muslim and non-Muslim users.Disclaimer.

According to the press release, Fidelity Digital Assets will focus on providing a “secure, compliant, and institutional-grade omnibus storage solution for bitcoin, ether and other digital assets.”Tom Jessop, head of the newly-created business, is quoted in as saying that Fidelity began exploring blockchain and crypto “several years ago,” telling CNBC in an interview today that the idea of commercializing a “standalone” crypto firm began in mid-2017.Fidelity cites research from Greenwich Associates that found that “70 percent” of institutional finance executives believe crypto will have a role in the future of the financial sector, yet many are still “sitting on the sidelines” before they enter the market.Jessop told CNBC the new company will leverage all “of the resources of a big organization"" — Fidelity reportedly already works with “over 13,000” institutional clients — to draw these actors into the emerging space.To this end, the newly-created company will draw on its reputation as a major Wall Street incumbent, and use technological solutions that have been “repurposed” from other parts of its organization, in Jessop’s words.For crypto trades, the press release states the firm will be using ""a proven internal crossing engine and smart order router for trade execution of digital assets” that will “allow for execution at multiple market venues.”As previously reported, unconfirmed reports surfaced this June suggesting that Fidelity was hiring developers to build a cryptocurrency exchange, citing internal correspondence at the time.The investment giant’s innovation lab has also had a partnership with major crypto exchange Coinbase as of mid-2017 to allow clients to view their Bitcoin (BTC) holdings alongside traditional assets in their portfolios."

Per the report, the parties agreed that Shrem could spend up to $50,000 on monthly expenses.Shrem’s lawyer, Brian Klein, said that the allegations that Shrem used ill-gotten Bitcoin to purchase cars and houses had “no basis in fact or law.” Bloomberg quotes Klein as saying that the recent ruling on Shrem’s assets is a first step toward his client’s “complete vindication.” A trial has reportedly been scheduled for June 17, 2019."

Taylor noted that the “free market can ultimately design the better money than the government,” underlining:“I do think it’s inevitable. They [governments] all are going —  through either competitors’ pressure or through their own desires — to launch their own cryptocurrencies. But I don’t think it is where the greatest innovations will occur.”Taylor also said that governments globally would start to regulate the crypto space very soon, and that “the smaller nations will move first as the risks [for them] are lower.” As well, Dash’s CEO made the prediction that the U.S. government will regulate the industry beginning as soon as next year.In July, Cointelegraph also spoke with Ryan Taylor about the security of cryptocurrencies and the possibility for their categorization as securities.In Tuesday’s interview, as a response to recent claims from Ethereum (ETH) core developer Joey Zhou, who called out Petro, the Venezuelan state-owned cryptocurrency, in plagiarizing parts of its white paper from Dash, Taylor said that it was not surprising, noting:“It is an open source code and using the word ‘plagiarize’ is quite difficult to apply, [but] there are significant portions they have copied.”Earlier this week, an executive from the Bank of Japan stated that central bank-issued digital currencies are not a practical economic tool, because they would require the elimination of fiat money from the financial system in order to be effective.In July, however, an E.U. parliamentary study found that central bank-issued digital currencies could be a “remedy” for the current lack of competition in the crypto space."

blockchain — just like miners do within the Bitcoin's (BTC) blockchain.","Nov 15, 2018","Recently, Blockchain protocol EOS became subject of a new scandal: its governance model was exposed, as evidence suggesting that some confirmed transactions were reversed surfaced on Reddit.","Crypto community was alarmed by the company’s attitude toward decentralization, which, however, is not the EOS’ top priority. According to co-founder Daniel Larimer, EOS team prefers to focus on “anti-censorship and robustness against being shut down.”EOS.io is a blockchain-powered smart contracts protocol for the development, hosting, and execution of decentralized applications (dApps). It was launched in June 2018 as open-source software, while first test nets and the original whitepaper emerged earlier in 2017. The platform was developed by block.one, a startup registered in the Cayman Islands and lead by Daniel Larimer and Brendan Blumer.EOS holds the absolute record in terms of funds raised during initial coin offerings (ICOs): it has managed to gather around $4.1 billion worth of investments, or roughly 7.12 million Ethereum (ETH), after fundraising for nearly a year. The number remains unmatched to date.The protocol is supported by the native cryptocurrency EOS, currently the sixth largest crypto by total market cap. Those tokens can be staked for using network resources either for personal use or leased out for developers use — as per the project’s whitepaper, dApp developers can build their product on the top of the EOS.io protocol and make use of its servers, bandwidth and computational power, as those resources are distributed equally among EOS holders. Basically, EOS.io attempts to represent a decentralized alternative to cloud hosting services.EOS employs a consensus model called Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPOS). That means that its investors are rewarded with voting power and decide who gets to mine the EOS blockchain.Thus, the EOS ecosystem rests upon at least two major entities — the EOS Core Arbitration Forum (ECAF), effectively its ‘judicial branch,’ and Block Producers (BPs), who produce blocks on the EOS blockchain — just like miners do within the Bitcoin’s (BTC) blockchain.BPs earn EOS tokens produced by inflation — according to some estimations, top three EOS BPs obtain around 1000 tokens per day. They are elected through the constant voting process, and their number is capped at 21 — consequently, the top is fluid, and BP candidates who earn enough votes can replace the BPs in power any minute.On November 11, a screenshot showing a ECAF moderator reversing transactions which had already been confirmed, was posted on Reddit, and gathered hundreds of comments.According to Reddit user u/auti9003, a dispute allegedly involving a phished EOS account was referred to one of the platform’s “arbitrators” Ben Gates, who decided to reverse transactions that happened without the owner’s permission. This, the user noted, involved undoing transactions which had already received network confirmations — most of cryptocurrencies would require a hard fork for that (like Ethereum with DAO), but EOS relies on a more flexible model.Summarizing, the arbitrator referred to the EOS constitution as a basis for the decision. He wrote:“Under the powers afforded to me as arbitrator under article 6 of the Rules of Dispute Resolution, I, Ben Gates, rule that the EOS account in dispute should be returned to the claimant with immediate effect and that the freeze over the assets within the said account is removed.”That move outraged decentralization maximalists, as Reddit responses mostly claimed that EOS had failed to prove its use case versus other more traditional centralized structures.“Why would anyone use this over a bank account and traditional legal system?” the most popular comment reads, adding:“These guys raised ($4 billion) to recreate the legal system using a token that is neither censorship resistant, nor immutable.”EOS’ model of governance has attracted controversy before: for instance, in early October, allegations arose accusing the platform’s major Block Producers (BPs), including Chinese crypto exchange Huobi, of “mutual voting” and “collusion.”Essentially, an alleged leaked Huobi spreadsheet suggested that main EOS nodes were involved in mutual voting along with pay-offs to remain in power of the EOS blockchain and keep their profits.Soon after, Block.one, the developer of EOS, published a statement, saying it was “aware of some unverified claims regarding irregular block producer voting, and the subsequent denials of those claims.” Nevertheless, there was no further update on the matter, while Huobi remains EOS’ top BP as of press time.Further, in June, an even bigger scandal occurred, when EOS BPs overrode an ECAF decision and froze seven accounts associated with phishing scams after the arbitration body failed to promptly come up with a response. The ECAF later retroactively ordered the accounts frozen, but the BP conference call-based decision caused some to question EOS’ decentralized system, and to label the move as ‘power abuse.’Less than a week after, another ECAF order to stop processing transactions involving 27 more addresses surfaced. Interestingly, it lacked any explanation for blocking the addresses, promising to do so on a later date.That attracted another round of harsh criticism from the crypto crowd, and, after an apparent fake ECAF order began to circulate on social media sever days later, some BPs, notably EOS New York, announced that they would suspend execution of any such orders, as they couldn't’ tell if they were legitimate. Yet again, the ECAF and BPs struggled to coordinate their action, and that many decisions on EOS blockchain were handled by centralized entities.On November 1, more detailed and grounded criticism of EOS’ governance model arrived, as blockchain testing company Whiteblock published results of “the first independent benchmark testing of the EOS software.” Essentially, the investigation came to several conclusions about the EOS, the most bold of which was that “EOS is not a blockchain,” but “rather a distributed homogeneous database management system,” because its transactions were reportedly “not cryptographically validated.”Additionally, the research results showed inaccuracies in performance claims. In July, EOS’ chief technology officer Daniel Larimer tweeted that EOS was performing 2351 transactions per second (Ethereum, for comparison, can process around 15). The Whiteblock report, however, showed that with “real world conditions” of round trip latency and 0.01 percent packet loss, EOS performance was below 50 TPS, “putting the system in close proximity to the performance that exists in Ethereum.”Thus, the investigation concluded that “the foundation of the EOS system is built on a flawed model that is not truly decentralized.” Later, on November 6, the EOS Alliance, a non-profit organization formed by EOS community members and block producers with the role to “facilitate the dialogue within community,” published a response signed by its Interim Executive Director Thomas Cox. Dubbed “Yes, EOS is a blockchain,” it criticized Whiteblock’s “provocative paper,” noting that the benchmarking firm “only recruited Ethereum folks for the project.”Still, EOS’ chief technology officer Daniel Larimer confirms that his company does not aim to be decentralized. In an interview with YouTube blog “Colin Talks Crypto” aired on October 3, Larimer clarified his vision:“Decentralization isn’t what we’re after. What we’re after is anti-censorship and robustness against being shut down.”Nevertheless, Larimer added that his project was still more decentralized than Bitcoin and Ethereum, because it takes 11 BPs to control the majority of EOS network, while BTC and ETH relied 4 and 3 pools respectively."

For its second round, the firm has reportedly attracted the interest of tech giants such as Samsung, Google’s venture arm GV, and Siemens, with talk of Ledger’s valuation reaching as high as $1 billion.While hardware wallets are widely regarded as being significantly safer than online storage, Ledger revealed in February this year it had discovered a vulnerability that affects all of its devices that could potentially lead to users losing their funds, subsequently outlining a method of protection for users to safeguard their transactions."

They were purportedly designed to phish users’ mobile banking credentials and credit card information.Stefanko classified the wallets into two groups, wherein the fake MetaMask app was a “phishing wallet” and the other three apps were “fake wallets.” Once the phishing app is installed and launched, it requests the user's private key and wallet password.In a video attached to the blog post, Stefanko explained his research into the “fake wallets,” noting the example of the fake NEO app dubbed “Neo Wallet”, which had over 1,000 installs since its launch in October.The fake crypto wallets reportedly did not create a new wallet through generating a public address and a private key — which are needed to securely send and receive digital currency — but only displayed the attacker’s public address with no user access to the private key. Thinking that the app generated their public address, users would deposit their funds to that wallet, but were unable to withdraw them as the private key belonged to a cybercriminal.Stefanko noted that the apps were developed using the Drag-n-Drop app builder service, which does not require specific coding knowledge from the user. This means that nearly anyone is able to “develop” a simple malicious app to steal sensitive personal data, “once the Bitcoin (BTC) price rises,” according to Stefanko.The analyst states in the post that he reported the fake apps to the Google security team, after which the wallets were subsequently removed.Just yesterday, Cointelegraph reported that the official Twitter account of Google's G Suite was supposedly compromised to promote a Bitcoin (BTC) giveaway scam. Scammers reportedly spread a message luring users to participate in a fraudulent 10,000 BTC giveaway."

There may be a role for the state to supply money to the digital economy,” she told the event.The comments come a day after the IMF published a dedicated report on CBDCs, examining what it views as the pros and cons of the financial tool.As Lagarde noted, various jurisdictions are currently considering or starting out on the journey to implement state-sponsored tokens.If done properly, CBDCs could “could satisfy public policy goals,” she said, specifically “financial inclusion,” “security and consumer protection,” and “privacy in payments.”As Cointelegraph reported in September, the IMF has not always been as keen on the concept as Lagarde suggests today.In a report at the time, the organization suggested the Marshall Islands, which wants to issue a national digital currency to circulate in tandem with the U.S.  dollar, should reconsider its plans over money laundering concerns.This week, the country’s president survived a no confidence vote over the issue, which should now continue on its path to digital currency issuance.During the speech in Singapore, Lagarde meanwhile continued on the “downsides” of CBDCs,“I would also like to highlight risks of stifling innovation — the last thing you want.

in late 2017, which saw the price of Bitcoin skyrocket from $5,000 to ...","Nov 14, 2018","On October 30, South Korea’s main financial authority officially cleared banks to work with crypto exchanges for the first time in history, establishing a major milestone for the local cryptocurrency sector.","At the state affairs audit, held by both government parties of South Korea to evaluate and track the progress of every government branch and agency under the administration of President Moon Jae-in, Financial Services Commission (FSC) commissioner, Choi Jong-ku, stated that the FSC has cleared banks to work with cryptocurrency exchanges by providing virtual bank accounts.On the digital asset trading platforms of South Korea, every bank account holder is provided with a virtual bank account by the account issuer, in this case a local bank, to provide an instantaneous and efficient system to withdraw and deposit funds.Cryptocurrency investors in South Korea are not required to wait one to five days for deposits and withdrawals to clear, as they can safely store the South Korean won on exchanges by leveraging the security of local banks.Commissioner Choi stated that banks and financial institutions are authorized to provide virtual bank accounts to cryptocurrency exchanges, given that the exchanges have strict Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) systems in place that do not allow anonymous accounts and users to trade digital assets.“There exists no issue in banks providing virtual bank accounts to cryptocurrency exchanges. If digital asset trading platforms have KYC and AML systems in place, there is no problem in issuing virtual bank accounts to exchanges.”The approval of banks by the FSC, to open virtual accounts for cryptocurrency investors, is not equivalent to the approval of anonymous accounts. Virtual bank accounts in South Korea refer to replica accounts of bank holders, provided to third party platforms like cryptocurrency exchanges to allow instantaneous deposits and withdrawals.Throughout the past five years, despite the increase in demand for cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, the government of South Korea has been skeptical towards regulating the asset class and the market because it feared that the implementation of a regulatory framework would come across as an endorsement of the asset class to the public.However, the abrupt increase in the valuation of the cryptocurrency market in late 2017, which saw the price of Bitcoin skyrocket from $5,000 to $20,000, and briefly reach $25,000 in South Korea due to the so-called “Kimchi Premium” that refers to premium rates on major cryptocurrencies, encouraged the government to strictly regulate the market and demand local cryptocurrency exchanges to enable investor protection.In June, Kim Yong-bum, the vice chairman of the FSC, officially declared that the Kimchi Premium in the cryptocurrency exchange market of South Korea has dematerialized, eliminating the possibility of investors overseas, to take advantage of the premium and arbitrage.“The government’s practical policies led the ‘Kimchi Premium’ to disappear in South Korea. At its peak, the ‘Kimchi Premium’ in the local cryptocurrency exchange market reached 50 percent, due to unusual spike in demand and speculation. As of current, the price of cryptocurrencies is nearly identical to other markets, demonstrating stability in the South Korean cryptocurrency market.”At the time, the FSC had taken its first approach towards regulating the market to prioritize investor protection. Seeing some progress in its efforts, the FSC and the rest of the local financial authorities in South Korea continued to regulate the space. In hindsight, the formation of the Kimchi Premium and the lack of investor protection in the cryptocurrency market throughout late 2017 and early 2018 led the government to properly regulate the market.The latest decision of the FSC to clear banks to cooperate with crypto exchanges represent the willingness of the government to legitimize the market, reflecting the government’s previous plans released in July, to regulate cryptocurrency exchanges as proper financial institutions.All of the major cryptocurrency exchanges in South Korea including Bithumb, Upbit, Coinone, and Korbit, the top four trading platforms in terms of daily trading volume, and every other minor cryptocurrency exchange will be entitled to fair banking service moving forward, as legitimate financial businesses.Banks will not be able to reject crypto exchanges for any reason other than money laundering. As long as cryptocurrency exchanges are compliant with local KYC and AML regulations, then banks are not permitted to refrain from providing banking services to trading platforms.On October 30, the Seoul Central District Court ruled on a case between a cryptocurrency exchange and a major bank in favor the exchange, further solidifying and strengthening the right of digital asset trading platforms to obtain fair, transparent, and stable banking services from local financial institutions.On the same day FSC chairman Choi officially approved banks to work with crypto exchanges, the Seoul Central District Court released its decision on a court case between local cryptocurrency exchange, Coinis, and major commercial bank, Nonghyup.In early September, Coinis filed a complaint in court after Nonghyup unilaterally ended its banking services to the exchange. Kim Tae-rim, a Seoul-based attorney who represented Coinis, claimed that Nonghyup had no right to abruptly end its services to the exchange.Although Nonghyup responded that it had followed the guideline of the FSC, in lawfully rejecting to provide services to the exchange, the court sided with Coinis and requested the bank to resume services to the platform.Attorney Kim stated that the case is a historic achievement for the cryptocurrency sector, as it will establish a precedent in the long-term and will discourage banks from unilaterally refusing to provide services to digital asset exchanges.“Cryptocurrency exchanges, by default, have the right to freely deposit and withdraw funds to and from major banks in South Korea, and an abrupt termination of partnership and services by the bank [in this case Nonghyup] without sufficient evidence or reasoning falls under the breach of contract.”For eight months, since January, Nonghyup also refused to provide services to Bithumb, which disallowed the largest exchange in South Korea from registering new users.Image taken from CoinCap.io, top five exchanges in the crypto marketThe renewal of the contract between Nonghyup and Bithumb came about after the exchange overhauled its security and internal management systems, subsequent to suffering two consecutive hacking attacks.But, given the timing of the contract renewal, it is possible that the bank was anticipating the stance of the FSC prior to publicly announcing its deal with Bithumb. A Bithumb representative said at the time:“Bithumb is now able to issue virtual bank accounts for new users after a partnership has been established with NH Bank. Bithumb will continue to comply with the bank’s guideline strictly while cooperating with the government to create a transparent and robust market for local investors.”Throughout the years to come, exchanges that are approved by the FSC and local financial authorities, will face no issues in receiving bank support from every major bank in the country.On October 2, Min Byung-du, the chairman of Korea’s National Policy Committee, called for a proper adoption of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, encouraging the government to end its cautious approach towards regulating the space.Chairman Min specifically addressed the imposition of a blanket ban on domestic initial coin offerings (ICOs) and firmly stated that the government has to embrace the rapidly growing market with practical, positive, and efficient regulatory frameworks that can facilitate the growth of the local sector.Under the premise that money laundering, extreme speculation, and fraudulent operations are prevented with necessary regulation, chairman Min emphasized that the government should allow ICOs and other cryptocurrency-related activities.“Regulation is not bad. Regulation is necessary, it is the only way to legitimize the market and allow investors to build trust towards the cryptocurrency market. The government cannot dismiss ICO. It needs to allow companies to conduct ICO. ICO has become a new trend in the global market and it is the responsibility and ability of the government to embrace new technologies. We can see that the flow of investment is clearly changing compared to ICO and angel fundraising. The ICO has raised $1.7 billion for Telegram and $4 billion for Block.One, It is getting bigger and bigger.""During his speech delivered to the Congress, chairman Min referred to ICOs as a primary example of innovation related to the fourth industrial revolution that is currently blocked out by the government. But, Min also added that other potential technologies and activities related to the asset class and the crypto sector have to be allowed for the country to remain at the forefront of blockchain technology development.Perhaps influenced by the call of chairman Min, local publications have reported that the government is planning to allow domestic ICOs by the end of the year.In January, a spokesperson of a cryptocurrency task force, established by the government of South Korea, told mainstream media outlet, Chosun, that the government was planning to allow institutional investors to invest in domestic ICOs. However, the report was met with fierce criticism and outrage from local investors.“Currently, the task force is considering imposing stricter regulations for investor and consumer protection within the cryptocurrency market.” The spokesperson added “in regards to ICOs, the government will likely impose regulations to enable institutional investors to invest in ICOs.”While Cointelegraph reported that FSC commissioner Choi expressed a negative stance towards the unregulated nature of ICOs, on October 26, Ministry of Science and ICT minister, Yoo Young-min, said the ministry is exploring the legalization of ICOs.According to a local publication, a key government official explained that it is difficult to ban investors from participating in ICOs because they are conducted in a peer-to-peer manner using Bitcoin and Ethereum.The official stated that it is better for the government to provide clarity, regulation, and taxation policy to regulate the space with sufficient investor protection.“It is realistically difficult to outright ban ICOs. Given that it is challenging for local financial authorities to impose a blanket ban on ICOs, the government is currently favoring several policies like restrictive access to ICOs or strengthened regulation on ICOs as alternative solutions.”Already, several regions in South Korea, such as the country’s two largest cities Seoul and Busan, have disclosed their plans to legalize ICOs in the upcoming months.Jeju Island, which operates as an independent state that is permitted to have its own laws outside of federal laws, has also released its plans to adopt cryptocurrencies and legalize ICOs. Jeju Island is also currently finalizing its plans to create a special zone for global blockchain and cryptocurrencies that will operate as a crypto hub within the country.On September 11, South Korea’s venture enterprise division formally decided to eliminate cryptocurrency exchanges from the newly drafted and proposed venture bill that provides small to medium-size companies with a variety of benefits including tax and investment merits.The rationale of the venture enterprise division for eliminating digital asset trading platforms was its acknowledgement of cryptocurrency trading as gambling, which contradicts the government’s stance towards cryptocurrency exchanges and the recently released statement of FSC commissioner Choi.Local exchanges, investors, and the South Korea Blockchain Association requested for clarity from the government regarding the questionable decision of the venture enterprise division that went against all of the positive efforts the government has demonstrated over the past eleven months to regulate the space.“We cannot understand the government’s stance on cryptocurrency regulations, and it is completely illogical for the government to leave a rapidly growing industry out of a major bill like this,” an exchange operator who asked to remain anonymous due to the sensitivity of the issue, said.The FSC also recently warned investors against cryptocurrency hedge funds, claiming that many public funds fail to represent legal investing tools that comply with South Korea’s Capital Markets Act.Overall, the cryptocurrency market of South Korea remains highly positive in regards to the decision of the FSC to allow banks to work with crypto exchanges and issue virtual bank accounts to trading platforms without the risk of unilateral termination of service.Over the months to come, the government is expected to work with the South Korea Blockchain Association, to strengthen KYC and AML systems employed by cryptocurrency exchanges and to implement sophisticated transaction monitoring systems to eliminate money laundering."

To ensure more accuracy, the company also included more general blockchain-related terms, while excluding jobs from third-party recruiting firms. To estimate salaries, Glassdoor used its “Know Your Worth” instrument.Per the report, as of August 2018 there were 1,775 unique blockchain-related job openings in the U.S., while at this time last year there were 446 similar job ads, which represents a 300 percent year-over-year increase.The highest proportion of job openings is concentrated in 15 cities, including New York City and San Francisco, with 24 and 21 percent of total job ads respectively. They are followed by San Jose, Chicago, and Seattle, with 6, 5 and 4 percent respectively. The top 15 cities together constitute 79 percent of blockchain-related job ads in the U.S., while the remaining 21 percent are distributed across the rest of the country.The most in-demand blockchain roles are primarily technical and engineering, with software engineer as the clear leader, comprising 19 percent of total job listings. More broadly, engineering, technology, and science roles represent 55 percent of total job openings.Despite the leadership of tech roles, Glassdoor notes the need for analyst relations manager, product manager, risk analyst, and marketing manager roles as well. Notably, such roles as traders and investment analysts are not listed in the top 15 occupations.In terms of predominating employers in the field, Glassdoor highlights blockchain software technology firm ConsenSys and IBM, with over 200 related job openings each, as well as crypto exchanges Coinbase and Kraken, tech company Oracle, and fintech firm Figure. Professional services giants Accenture and KPMG are also hiring blockchain-related roles. Glassdoor noted the absence of job openings from Facebook, Google and Apple.Glassdoor’s “Know Your Worth” tool revealed that the median base salary in the blockchain field is $84,884 per year, which is $32,423, or 61.8 percent, higher than the U.S. median salary of $52,461 per year. In total, salaries range from $36,046 per year to $223,667 per year. Per the report, higher salaries are explained by the location and nature of the jobs available, while high skill occupations like software engineers already require high salaries.In August, Cointelegraph reported a 50 percent increase in the number of roles related to blockchain or cryptocurrencies in Asian markets — Australia, India, Singapore and Malaysia —  since 2017, where developers skilled in the Python language programming are among the most coveted applicants."

According to the report, the firm’s revenue increased in 2018 after the introduction of blockchain services.","The report notes that the company’s Q3 revenue reached $45.3 million, representing an increase of 1.1% year-over-year. The firm attributed $19.8 million of that revenue to its cloud and Internet value-added services sectors, which is an increase of 8.3 percent over the same period last year.Lei Chen, CEO of Xunlei group, stated that blockchain remains one of the key investment areas for the company, noting:“We believe that blockchain is a technology that can change our lives, and we will strive to make it available in different areas in a simpler and more cost-effective way.”The company specifically mentioned its blockchain platform ThunderСhain, which has been launched this year, and lists recent blockchain-related partnerships, including a deal with the largest media group in China, People’s Daily, which is also the official newspaper of the Communist Party of China.Xunlei, known for its P2P software and BitTorrent client and especially popular in China, re-oriented towards blockchain technology development in October 2017.Back then, following a sustained downturn over two years, the company announced its first blockchain-driven initiative: the Link Token, which could be used to pay for some of Xunlei’s services. Shortly after, Xunlei became the best performing stock on Nasdaq, seeing up to 75 percent increase in shares, according to Bloomberg.Later, in November, Xunlei came under scrutiny from China’s financial regulator following a state ban on Initial Coin Offerings (ICO). Consequently, its shares fell 40 percent. Despite the loss, Xunlei launched two new blockchain products in the spring, StellarCloud and ThunderChain Open Platform. Several months after the launch, the company’s CEO Lei Chen claimed that in Q2 Xunlei saw a $65.8 million in revenue, meaning a growth of over 70 percent on a year-over-year basis.As Cointelegraph previously reported, in 2018 Xunlei also partnered with People’s Daily to construct a laboratory for “technology innovation” at the People Capital’s Blockchain Research Institute. Moreover, the two will develop a blockchain-driven platform to organize competitions, seminars, workshops, and promote and identify startups in the blockchain industry.Several crypto-related companies have recently published their Q3 2018 reports: Japanese IT giant GMO Internet revealed a “historical performance” of its crypto-related sector, and Canadian Bitcoin (BTC) mining company Hut 8 declared a record revenue of $13.5 million, an increase by 126 percent compared to the previous quarter’s revenue of $5.9 million.Moreover, Q3 2018 marks biggest quarter yet for Bitcoin revenue of Square — a U.S. financial services company that introduced Bitcoin support in its Square Cash payment app earlier this year."

According to local newspaper The Sacramento Bee, Newsom brought crypto onto the party political scene as early as 2014, when he became one of the first high-profile politicians to accept campaign donations in Bitcoin (BTC).The newly-elected California governor notably counts crypto entrepreneurs the Winklevoss twins as donors, who reportedly laid down a collective total of $116,800 in 2017 for his campaign. While the twins reportedly donated to Newsom’s campaign in fiat currency, the governor also maintained a BitPay page where supporters could make their donations in Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash (BCH).In Colorado, another Democrat, Jared Polis, outsripped Republican competitor Walker Stapleton, with the former sealing 51.6 percent of the vote against the latter’s 45 percent. Polis’ Bitpay campaign donation page similarly accepted Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. His campaign website for the midterm elections contained an entire page devoted to his Blockchain Policy, outlining five area in which he intends to explore the technology .These include voter protection and bolstering cybersecurity infrastructure, blockchain-based solutions to improve Colorado’s energy grid, and using public ledgers so that there is more transparency in regard to state contracts, expenditure, and other government bureaucracy.Polis further indicated his intent to establish regulatory sandboxes in order to encourage blockchain firms to “flock to the state,” stating that their work can create “government applications that save taxpayers money and create value for Colorado residents.”To this end, Polis pledged “to create a statewide safe harbor designed to exempt cryptocurrencies from state money transmissions laws.” He further stated plans to work to “establish legislation that protects ‘open blockchain tokens’ or cryptocurrencies that are exchangeable for goods and services,” from cumbersome licensing requirements that apply under extant securities and currency laws.As previously reported, Polis’ blockchain policy draws on a precedent from the U.S. state of Wyoming, which this March which created a new class of assets by defining cryptocurrencies as “Utility Tokens.”That same month, the Wyoming state legislature passed a House Bill that effectively exempts crypto from state securities regulations, signed into law by Governor Matt Mead. While the nationwide impact remains to be seen, both Wyoming’s and Polis’ pledge as governor indicate an avenue for utility tokens to be defined differently as either securities or commodities."

For instance, the companies have to reveal the amounts of transactions and the identity of the customers.Moreover, both legal entities and individuals residing in Brazil are now obliged to report all the transactions they have carried out at foreign crypto exchanges if they surpass R$10,000 Brazilian reals ($2,700) per month.The RFB’s draft on crypto taxation also sets a range of fines for those who fail to report their transactions. For the delay of a tax declaration, citizens will have to pay up to R$1,500 ($400). In case the information provided is insufficient or false, the RFB could charge up to 3 percent of transaction value as a fine as well.The tax watchdog has already opened a public consultation to receive proposals on the new regulation: notes will be accepted from Oct. 31 till Nov. 19.In the explanatory note, the regulator states that such measures have been taken due to the significant growth of the crypto industry in the country. According to the RFB, the number of crypto exchange clients has already exceeded the number of users registered at B3 — the Brazilian stock exchange based in Sao Paulo. In its turn, the daily volume of transactions conducted by five major Brazilian crypto exchanges surpasses R$8.3 million (around $2.2 million).The regulator’s draft follows a move by Brazilian banks to close some crypto-related accounts, which led to a probe launched by local antitrust agency CADE. The investigation was initiated on the request of the Brazilian Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Association (ABCB) following several complaints from crypto industry.CADE has sent a questionnaire to ten Brazilian crypto exchanges targeted by the bank’s decision. The companies were requested to explain how their business functioned in Brazil.In late October, the Federal District Court of Brazil forced major banks Banco do Brasil and Santander Brasil to reopen the accounts for local crypto exchange Bitcoin Max. The judge ruled that the banks’ decision to close the crypto-related accounts was “abusive conduct” violating consumer protection rules."

Need Them",https://cointelegraph.com/news/central-bank-issued-digital-currencies-why-governments-may-or-may-not-need-them,"“Something similar has to happen with Bitcoin. People will only switch to 
something new if it works better or is cheaper.” The following day ...","Oct 25, 2018","On October 20, The Bank of Japan’s (BOJ) deputy governor, Masayoshi Amamiya, repeated his negative stance towards central bank-issued digital currencies (CBDC), claiming that such digital currencies are unlikely to improve the existing monetary systems.","The concept of CBDC, or national cryptocurrencies, has attracted many governments across the world. Some of them have already rolled out their virtual currencies, some keep researching their economical impact, while others — like Japan — have decided to dismiss the idea altogether. Here’s what the concept entails, and why major governments choose to implement or deny it.CBDCs, or national digital currencies, are virtual currencies that are issued and controlled by a federal regulator. Hence, they are fully regulated by the state. CBDCs are not decentralized, like most cryptocurrencies — instead, they represent fiat money, only in digital form.Consequently, a central bank that issues its CBDC becomes, not only its regulator, but their clients’ account holder as well. Each CBDC unit acts as a secure digital equivalent to a paper bill, and is normally powered by distributed ledger technology (DLT).CBDCs could be seen as central banks’ response to the growing popularity of cryptocurrencies, which bypass regulators’ purview by design. CBDCs, in turn, aim to take the best from cryptocurrencies — namely the convenience and security, and combine those features with the time-tested features of the conventional banking system, where money circulation is regulated, and reserve-backed.Despite its status of the most crypto and blockchain-friendly country in Europe, Switzerland has expressed its doubts regarding the usefulness of CBDCs.In June, board director of the Swiss National Bank (SNB), Thomas Moser, stated that cryptocurrencies and blockchain are not innovative enough to consider issuing a state-backed digital currency. Speaking at the Crypto Valley blockchain conference in Zug — also known as the “Crypto Valley” — Moser compared blockchain in its present condition with the “useless innovation” of Compact Discs (CDs), arguing that cryptocurrencies merely imitate already existing products — such as “digital shares, bonds, vouchers”:“Something similar has to happen with Bitcoin. People will only switch to something new if it works better or is cheaper.”The following day, Moser told Business Insider that although there was initial interest among central banks in issuing CBDCs, “enthusiasm has slowed again because of the implications it would have for financial stability.”Previously, Switzerland showed its interest in issuing its CBDC, potentially titled “e-franc”: in May, the Federal Council of the Government of Switzerland requested a report on the risks and opportunities of introducing a government-backed digital currency. The idea to develop a national cryptocurrency was proposed in February by Romeo Lacher, chairman of the Swiss stock exchange SIX, when he argued that “an e-franc under the control of the central bank would create a lot of synergies — so it would be good for the economy.”The People’s Bank of China (PBoC) has been researching the concept of CBDC for some time now — a specific research institute named Digital Currency Research Lab was established for this very purpose last year.Recently, in September, PBoC extended the activities of the Digital Currency Research Lab beyond the country’s capital, opening a new research center in Nanjing — which could be a sign that a Chinese national digital currency is in the works. Moreover, in October, PBoC opened four positions for crypto-related professionals to develop a secure data platform and a chip processor that would allow crypto transactions.Previously, in March, governor of the PBoC, Zhou Xiaochuan, expressed the agency’s cautious position regarding the matter:“If [blockchain technologies] spread too rapidly, it may have a big negative impact on consumers. It could also have some unpredictable effects on financial stability and monetary policy transmission.”Zhou also declared that digital currency will ultimately diminish cash circulation, while stressing that the PBoC “must prevent substantial and irreparable damages” to the domestic economy. Nevertheless, according to China Daily, he also claimed that the development of digital currency is “technologically inevitable.”Hong Kong has a much clearer position regarding CBDCs compared to mainland China: in May, its government issued a press release stating that Hong Kong will not issue a CBDC in the near future, citing the existence of an already efficient payment infrastructure. The statement was signed by Joseph Chan, the Acting Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury in the Legislative Council.Chan explained that the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI) — an agency comprised of members from the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) — and the Markets Committee (MC) of the Bank for International Settlements had been jointly studying the potential effects of CBDC. Conclusively, their report showed that “currently proposed implementations of CBDC for wholesale payments look broadly similar to, and not clearly superior to, existing infrastructures.”The paper also argued that any benefits of CBDC may be limited due to the existence of efficient private retail payment products, essentially making CBDC “a subject which requires further study and more proof-of-concept work to ascertain its feasibility for payment applications.”In February 2018, the government of Venezuela launched a national cryptocurrency called the Petro, or Petromoneda. It was first announced in December 2017 via TV, when Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro declared that his government was planning to issue a cryptocurrency backed by the country’s oil, gold, and mineral reserves. In January, he elaborated, stating that 100 million petros backed by an equivalent number of barrels of oil were about to be issued. According to Maduro, a number of fiat currencies, including the Russian ruble, the Chinese yuan, Turkish lira, and the euro would be freely convertible with Petro.Petro is not a CBDC per se, as it is not issued by the local central bank and is different from the extant fiat currency, the Sovereign Bolivar (although it is legal tender). Core developer of Ethereum, Joey Zhou, recently pointed out that Petro has apparently plagiarized parts of its white paper from the GitHub repository of Dash.The Venezuelan digital currency was designed to avoid the U.S. sanctions that negatively impacted the local economy — as Maduro put it, to fight the financial “blockade” erected by the U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration. Consequently, in March, Trump issued an order to effectively restrict American investors from participating in the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) of the Petro, which started on February 20. Nicolas Maduro has claimed that a total of $5 billion dollars was raised during the presale period — which would make it one of the largest ICOs to date, putting the $2 billion Telegram ICO and $1 billion token sale of EOS behind it. The public sale of Petro is set to begin on November 5.Petro reportedly has ties with Russia, as, according to anonymous sources cited in a Time article, the cryptocurrency has been receiving Russian support since 2017, particularly due to the appeal of bypassing western sanctions also imposed on the country. As the Russian state bank source allegedly told the publication, “People close to Putin, they told him this is how to avoid the sanctions.” Those claims were later denied by Konstantin Vyshkovsky, the head of the Russian Finance Ministry’s state debt department.The Venezuelan government seems to actively force Petro upon local citizens ahead of its public launch. For instance, Petro was recently made the only currency that Venezuelans can pay their passport fees in, while also increasing the fees: from October 8, a new passport costs 2 petros, and an extension costs 1 petro. The average monthly minimum wage in Venezuela, as Bloomberg reports, is four times less than the cost of the raised passport fee.Further, in a recent television broadcast, Maduro declared that “in the coming weeks,” workers would begin receiving bonus payments “based on” Petro, rather than the Sovereign Bolivar.Japan, the country where Bitcoin is recognized as an official means of payment, has publically discarded the concept of CBDC twice now. On October 20, Bank of Japan (BoJ) Deputy Governor, Masayoshi Amamiya, expressed his doubts regarding the effectiveness of CBDC, adding that his agency won’t be issuing its digital currency in the near future.More specifically, Amamiya responded to a theory suggesting that CBDCs can help governments overcome the ""zero lower bound"" — a situation in which interest rates fall to zero and they lose tools to stimulate the economy. As per the theory, CBDC would enable central banks to stimulate the economy by charging more interest on deposits from individuals and firms, and thus motivate them to spend more money.The Deputy Governor questioned that theory, claiming that charging interest on central bank-issued currencies would only work if central banks fully eliminate physical money from the financial system. Otherwise, the public will still continue converting digital currencies into cash in order to avoid paying interest.The elimination of fiat money in Japan is “not an option for us as a central bank,” since cash is still a popular method of payment in the country, Amamiya explained.Earlier this year, in April, the BoJ publically dismissed the idea of CBDC for the first time, as Amamiya declared that such currencies can have a negative impact on the existing financial system.That time, Amamiya noted that CBDCs are “[stimulating] global discussion on to what extent central banks should provide their payment and settlement infrastructures to society,” noting:“The issuance of central bank digital currencies for general use could be analogous to allowing households and firms to directly have accounts in the central bank. This may have a large impact on the aforementioned two-tiered currency system and private banks' financial intermediation.”The European Union seems to have taken a wait-and-see approach in terms of CBDC. In September, the European Central Bank (ECB) President, Mario Draghi, announced to the European Parliament that they have “no plans” to issue a digital currency.The ECB executive elaborated by arguing that “technologies which could potentially be used to issue a central bank digital currency, such as distributed ledgers, have not yet been thoroughly tested and require substantial further development” before the Central Bank would consider using them.Whilst stressing that “The ECB and the Eurosystem currently have no plans to issue a central bank digital currency,” he also added that his agency was “carefully analyzing the potential consequences of issuing such a currency as a complement to cash.”Moreover, Draghi used another popular argument against CBDCs, implying that the central bank would have to compete against other banks in the retail sector:“With regard to the central bank administering individual accounts for households and companies, this would imply that the central bank would enter into competition for retail deposits with the banking sector and lead to potentially substantial operational costs and risks.”Finally, he added there was “no concrete need” to issue an additional currency within the eurozone at the moment, because demand for cash banknotes “continues to grow” in the EU.Previously, in September 2017, when Draghi was asked about national cryptocurrencies, he stressed the following: ""No member state can introduce its own currency [...] The currency of the eurozone is the euro."" After his comment went live, Estonia shut down the development of Estcoin, a national cryptocurrency.Moreover, last summer Germany declared its negative stance: in July this year, the German Federal Ministry of Finance declared that issuing a CBDC would be too risky to implement, in a response to Green Party MP Gerhard Schick.""So far there are no convincing reasons for issuing digital central bank money for a wide range of users in Germany and the eurozone,"" business newspaper Handelsblatt quoted the Ministry as saying at the time.The Ministry further argued that the potential benefits of a CBDC –– namely high-speed bank transfers –– could also be achieved in other ways. In short, the agency claimed that CBDCs involve ""a number of risks that are not well understood.""Other fears voiced by the Ministry included a central bank jeopardizing its independence — as it would allegedly get a stronger position in the financial system by issuing a cryptocurrency — and the crisis scenario in which the central bank hits bankruptcy faster and on a larger scale due to lower transaction costs, along with the classic ones: AML compliance and terrorist funding concerns.In November 2017, the Bank of Canada published a report titled “Central Bank Digital Currency: Motivations and Implications,” which was co-authored by its Currency Department employee. Although such a paper does not necessarily represent the official stance the Bank of Canada takes in regard to CBDC, it clearly demonstrates the agency’s interest.In short, the document argued that, as society moves toward becoming cashless, the central bank’s essential revenue source, seigniorage — i.e., profits made from printing more money — becomes compromised. CBDC, in turn, allows it to maintain seigniorage through creating digital cash.Moreover, the Bank of Canada report mentioned the lack of transaction fees and financial inclusion as other potential benefits of CBDC but highlighted anonymity as “undesirable for central bank digital currency.” The paper concluded that more research is needed to decide if the Bank of Canada should implement a CBDC.In July 2018, the Bank of Canada released yet another research. In it, S. Mohammad R. Davoodalhosseini, who works at Funds Management and Banking Department of the central bank, argues that a CBDC has “certain potential benefits, including the possibility that it can bear interest,” while “the welfare gains of introducing CBDC are estimated as up to 0.64% forCanada.”In April this year, days after banning local banks from all crypto dealings, an Iranian government minister confirmed that an experimental model of a domestic digital currency had been developed. Information and Communications Technology (ICT) Minister, Mohammad Javad Azari-Jahromi, stated:“The central bank’s [ban] does not mean the prohibition or restriction of the use of the digital currency in domestic development.”Notably, Azari-Jahromi did not clarify whether the locally-developed digital currency will eventually be made available to the public, nor whether it will be issued by the Post Bank — 51 percent of which is owned by the government — or by another state body.The news about the experimental Iranian cryptocurrency could be tied to a report suggesting that Iran and Russia could start using cryptocurrencies to avoid Western sanctions. In May, Mohammad Reza Pourebrahimi, the head of the Iranian Parliamentary Commission for Economic Affairs, referred to cryptocurrencies as a promising way for both countries to avoid U.S. dollar transactions, as well as a possible replacement of the SWIFT interbank payment system.Indeed, recently the U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) called on cryptocurrency exchanges to monitor Iranian use of crypto to evade sanctions.Singapore has reportedly advanced in experimenting with a CBDC, although it’s not likely to go public.In June 2017, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) released a report regarding the so-called “Project Ubin”, a blockchain-powered plan to put a “tokenized form of the Singapore Dollar (SGD) on a [private Ethereum blockchain].” The project is a collaboration between the central bank and blockchain consortium R3, focused on the development of a blockchain pilot to facilitate cross-border payments.However, in January 2018, Ravi Menon, the managing director of the MAS, criticized the idea of CBDCs, especially in the public context. In an interview with the Financial Times, he argued:  “Why would the central bank want to [issue digital currency to the non-bank public]? If there’s any sense of nervousness about the banks, you will have a bank run; everybody is going to go into the central bank [with their deposits] [...] And, if people placed their deposits with central banks, who’s going to extend credit?”In December 2017, Sweden’s Central Bank (Riksbank) published an action plan for the second stage of the “e-Krona” project. An “e-Krona” is defined as “a general electronic means of payment” and as a “complement to cash.” The paper also notes that the Riksbank “has not yet taken a decision on whether to issue an e-Krona and the aim is not for an e-Krona to replace cash.”Indeed, the main reason for Riksbank to release “e-Krona” is the steeply dropping popularity of cash in the country. The central bank has conducted research — which is no longer available online, for some reason — the first of which was issued back in September 2017.If implemented, e-Krona could operate under two systems: a value-based one and a registered-based one. The latter version would have digital currency balances stored in accounts on a central database — potentially backboned by blockchain — while a value-based e-Krona would be stored separately on “deposited currency accounts.” The prospect of Riksbanks releasing a CBDC is considerably high, given the pace at which it moves to become the world’s first cashless society.In May, the Bank of England indicated its stance on CBDC in two staff working papers. Firstly, the central bank issued research analyzing various risks related to CBDCs. The paper notably found that, after initial approximation, there was no reason to believe that introducing a CBDC would have a negative effect on private credit or on total liquidity provision to the economy.Another working staff paper suggests that CBDC would endanger the current profitable business model used by commercial banks — namely the storage of individuals’ and corporations’ cash holdings. Allowing the “radical idea” that the public could be given the option to store their money at the central bank in the form of central bank digital currencies and transfer their money seamlessly, using digital wallets, the research warns that such a scenario could have critical consequences for the commercial banking sector:“Banks may be subject to an outflow of retail deposits, in particular in a scenario of financial stress.”In May, the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, declared that he was open-minded about the prospect of a implementing a CBDC, but stressed that any CBDC adoption would not happen any time soon.India is one of the latest countries to join the ranks of states actively researching CBDCs, as in August, the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) confirmed the creation of an inter-departmental group tasked with analyzing the usefulness of issuing a rupee-backed digital currency.Apparently, cost considerations became an important motivating factor for studying fiat-tethered CBDCs: the statistics cited by the Economic Times suggest the cost of printing paper notes in India was 6.3 billion rupees (about $89 million) in 2018. Moreover, RBI’s report argued that fiat printing costs motivate some other central banks to go digital as well:“Globally the rising costs of managing fiat paper/metallic money, have led central banks around the world to explore the option of introducing fiat digital currencies”.Other factors cited by the Indian central bank reportedly include “rapid changes in the payments industry” and the “rise” of private digital tokens.EY India’s Mahesh Makhija told the paper that ""the idea of a central bank issued digital currency is very promising, though issues around digital counterfeiting will need to be addressed."""

The registry notes that binary options, CFDs, forex, cryptocurrency options, and ICOs will fall under a new category of “High-Risk Securities Merchants” starting on Oct. 12, 2018, and will be subject to additional monitoring.According to Finance Magnates, the grouping means that chargebacks could now be executed up to 540 days after the actual date of the transaction.Anonymous sources familiar with the matter confirmed to Finance Magnates that the new classification by MasterCard will reportedly start on Monday, Oct. 15, while VISA is planning to implement a similar grouping in December of this year.The grouping targets all companies that operate their businesses without licenses or do not require them, the sources report.Some associated businesses have already reported to their customers that they will stop accepting credit cards, according to Finance Magnates, meaning that the clients of brokers that operate poorly regulated businesses will have to rely entirely on wire bank transfers or turn to alternative payment options.MasterCard’s reported announcement goes in line with the general anti-crypto stance publicly expressed by the company. In July 2018, MasterCard CEO Ajaypal Banga argued that anonymous, not-state-issued cryptocurrencies are “junk,” due to their high volatility and inability to operate as a medium of exchange.VISA had stopped supporting crypto debit cards via a partnership with debit card provider WaveCrest in January of this year, with affected cards including products from CryptoPay, Bitwala, TenX, Wirex, and others.Earlier today, Cointelegraph published an interview with well-known American economist Nouriel “Dr. Doom” Roubini, who had predicted the financial crisis of 2008. In the interview, Roubini again spoke negatively about cryptocurrencies, comparing them unfavorably to the traditional financial market, and claiming that major altcoin Ethereum (ETH) is a scam."

As soon as security specialists had detected the theft, the exchange temporarily suspended all deposits and withdrawals, and moved its customers’ funds to a cold wallet.Bithumb initially lost over $30 million worth of cryptocurrencies due to the hack. Four months after the incident, Bithumb recovered approximately $14 million in stolen digital assets after it collaborated with global counterparts.According to Ilya Bere, CEO of Changelly, the service quickly cooperated with Bithumb and the South Korean police to offer its help. The company implemented Anti-Money Laundering (AML) procedures targeting several malicious addresses recognized by Bithumb and prevented transactions from going through the application program interface (API).As a result, Changelly managed to capture a significant amount of cryptocurrency with a suspicious origin and keep the funds secured. The recovered funds were worth about $585,000 at the time of the hack, according to the press release. Bere further explained that the case could serve as an example of industry-wide engagement:“This case sets a precedent for how the joint work of the key players in the cryptocurrency market can positively affect the industry, bringing security improvements to the crypto-trading projects.”The Bithumb hack is one of the largest of 2018 so far, with the price of Bitcoin (BTC) dropping by $200 soon after.

South Korean Investors",https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitstamp-is-looking-towards-global-expansion-after-being-acquired-by-south-korean-investors,"In 2017, Bitstamp became one of four crypto exchanges that provides the CME 
Group with pricing data for its Bitcoin futures trading. Kodrič told ...","Oct 30, 2018","On October 29, the cryptocurrency exchange, Bitstamp, was acquired by Belgium-based investment firm NXMH, which in turn, is owned by South Korean media conglomerate NXC Corp.","The Luxembourg-registered exchange is now controlled by the same company that bought the majority stake in the South Korean crypto exchange, Korbit, last year, while its CEO remains in office to continue with Bitstamp’s “global expansion.”Bitstamp was launched in August 2011 by Nejc Kodrič and Damijan Merlak in their native Slovenia. As Kodrič recalled in an interview, their business started out in a garage “with an initial capital of just a thousand euros, two laptops and a server.” The idea to open up an exchange came to the entrepreneurs after they experienced difficulties buying Bitcoin in Europe.As they told Forbes, when they were originally registering their exchange with a Slovenian bank in 2011, it didn’t object because people in Slovenia “didn’t know what Bitcoin was.” In April 2013, Kodrič and Merlak outsourced support, compliance, and legal needs to the U.K., because they couldn’t do all the screening ""necessary to keep bad guys out"" in their home country. Bitstamp was now a UK registered limited company.In 2016, Bitstamp became Europe’s first fully legal crypto exchange after it received a license from Luxembourg to operate as a payment institution. To receive the document, the exchange went through two years of various checks, including an audit by Ernst & Young. Being a compliant business, Bitstamp has stuck to strict Know-Your-Customer (KYC) principles.In 2017, Bitstamp became one of four crypto exchanges that provides the CME Group with pricing data for its Bitcoin futures trading. Kodrič told Cointelegraph at the time:“It’s essential that we ensure that all data provided does not include any forms of manipulation that could affect the index. We’re proud that we’ve earned the trust of the industry and were chosen to be a part of the new Bitcoin futures market.”Security seems to be one of the main priorities for Bitstamp, especially after the 2015 hack, when the exchange lost 19,000 BTC (around $5 million at the time). The fraudsters stole the funds from Bitstamp’s hot wallet in a typical phishing attack — the exchange employees received personal emails and Skype messages from seemingly friendly sources. As a result, the person responsible for security, Bitstamp system administrator Luka Kodrich, downloaded malware onto the work computer, which led to the exchange’s security getting breached.Compensation did not follow, but the security regime was significantly toughened. Specifically, carrying out transactions on Bitstamp now requires using multisignature, and 98 percent of the cryptocurrency is stored in a cold wallet.Established back in 2011, Bitstamp is the oldest active crypto exchange in the world. It is currently ranked 26th on CoinMarketCap, seeing around $65,858,358 in trades in the 24 hours before press time. Kodrič told Reuters their volume has been down between 60-70 percent comparing to previous years, but stressed that Bitstamp remained profitable in 2018 because current cryptocurrency prices were still higher than they were for most of last year.On October 29, Reuters reported that Bitstamp has been acquired by Brussels-based investment firm NXMH in an “all cash deal.” Prior to that, the exchange had raised a total of about $14 million from investors including Pantera Capital, which invested $10 million in Bitstamp in 2014.NXMH is a family investment holding which has over 2 billion euros in assets “managing the wealth of an Asian tech entrepreneur,” as per its Linkedin profile. It was founded in 2011 and focuses on European consumer and tech investments. The firm is a subsidiary of South Korea-based media giant NXC Corp, which bought a 65.19 percent stake in South Korean crypto exchange Korbit last year.The deal between NXMH and Bitstamp was reportedly finalized on October 25. Whilst Kodrič declined to share the full terms to the media, he informed Reuters that in 2016 Bitstamp was valued at $60 million, up from $39 million in 2014. Interestingly, in March 2018 the exchange was rumored to be “in the final stages” of being acquired by South Korean investors (of which NXMH is technically a subsidiary) for $400 million.NXMH now has an 80 percent stake in Bitstamp, with Kodrič retaining his 10 percent ownership interest and staying on as CEO. NXMH has also reportedly obtained “part” of Pantera Capital’s $10 million stake in the exchange, however it will keep a six percent ownership stake in the exchange. Kodrič’s co-founder, Damian Merlak, has reportedly sold all of his 30 percent stake in the exchange in the NXMH deal. According to Kodrič, his co-founder has “not been active since 2015.”Bitstamp CEO does not believe anything will change for either the exchange’s customers or its 180 employees following the acquisition, as he told Fortune:“We have kind of the same opinion as NXMH — why change something if it works perfectly well?”He added that a merger between Bitstamp and Korbit (both owned by one parent company NXC Corp.) was in the talks, but the parties decided to run the exchange separately in the end. The crypto exchanges still plan to share technology, research, and development resources, according to Kodrič.NXMH was one of four interested bidders for Bitstamp in a process that began in “mid-2017.” He added that they initially struck the deal last December, as the price of Bitcoin was peaking near $20,000, and it took several months for the companies to receive regulatory approval for the arrangement.Kodrič claims that he and Merlak “were not looking to sell,” and “were definitely not looking for investment because they “didn’t need to raise the capital.” Nevertheless, he took the opportunity to cash out on the majority of his share in the company while keeping 10 percent and remaining the CEO:“[Bitstamp and NXMH] were very much aligned—where we see the industry going and what the company wants to be [...] They’re willing to help us along the way, and help us with our global expansion.”Earlier in February, Goldman Sachs-backed, Circle startup, acquired the US-based Poloniex crypto exchange for $400 million.In late May, Japanese crypto exchange BitTrade was acquired for S$67 million ($50 million) by a Singaporean multi-millionaire and entrepreneur, Eric Cheng. After purchasing a 100 percent stake in the company, Cheng became the first foreign investor to own an exchange licensed by Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA).On August 31, Japanese e-commerce giant Rakuten, with a market capitalization of over $12.5 billion, revealed a 265 million yen ($2.4 million) deal to acquire domestic crypto exchange, Everybody’s Bitcoin.In October, BK Global Consortium, a group led by one of South Korea's leading plastic surgeons, Dr. Kim Byung Gun, closed a deal to obtain “50 percent plus one share” of BTC Holding Co. – the largest investor in Bithumb crypto exchange. According to Bloomberg, the purchase was settled at around 400 billion won ($352 million) and will be finalized in February 2019."

In August, Berkshire is reported to have bought a roughly $300 million stake in the parent company of Paytm, India’s largest mobile-payments service.The second investment was made just this past week, through the purchase of shares in an initial public offering (IPO) for Brazilian payments processor StoneCo, the country’s fourth-largest by volume.The WSJ underscores that both decisions mark something of a departure for Berkshire, which  which has $711.932 billion in assets under management as of 2018, and is best-known for its investments in blue-chip firms such as Coca-Cola and acquisitions of utilities and insurance firms.Buffett has in the past said that tech investments are beyond his area of expertise, WSJ notes.That tech is not within Buffett’s “circle of competence” was affirmed by self-professed Buffett disciple venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya this spring, when he took his icon to task for his virulent anti-crypto stance.Combs, alongside Berkshire’s second portfolio manager Ted Weschler, are nonetheless reported to be “widening the net” of the conglomerate: yet, as WSJ highlights, both Stone and Paytm are considered to be established companies, which dominate their respective local markets and operate in tightly regulated industries.The WSJ says Berkshire’s backing is a sign of the “maturity” of the fintech sector, which reportedly raised almost $35 billion in venture capital during the first three quarters of 2018.Berkshire’s move to put major capital into two fintech firms that target emerging markets squares uneasily with the vocal position of Buffett, who has become notorious in fintech and crypto circles for castigating Bitcoin (BTC) as being “rat poison-squared.” He has made repeated statements claiming that Bitcoin is neither a currency, nor a way of investing. In October 2017, Buffet predicted that Bitcoin had entered the “bubble territory,” and was set “to implode.”India saw soaring demand for cryptocurrencies during the period of economic turmoil that followed its prime minister’s bold — and still highly contentious — demonetization policy in late 2016. Crypto’s popularity continued through 2017, eliciting a controversial anti-crypto crackdown from the country’s central bank (RBI) this April, which has prompted both public and industry-led petitions.As a final verdict on the RBI ban continues to be repeatedly stayed, the judiciary has now thrown the ball back in the executive’s court, setting a deadline for the government to clarify and finally cement its official position on crypto by mid-November.This month, in Brazil, the country’s largest brokerage has revealed it will launch a Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH) exchange, saying it was pushed into the crypto business by the popularity of the asset class among investors."

My concern is the law of unintended consequences.”The Telegraph reports that the U.K. has so far been slow to get to grips with its domestic cryptocurrency ecosystem, despite London being home to some of the industry’s well-known names such as trading platform eToro and exchange Bitstamp.In March, the FCA initiated a cryptocurrency “task force,” the premise of which was to assess “what to do about” the phenomenon, FCA chairman John Griffith-Jones said at the time.Cryptocurrencies, he added, had “the potential of causing consumer harm unless brought within the regulatory perimeter.”"

According to a study published by the Bank of Netherlands in February 2018, only two percent of online retailers accepted crypto, in spite of ""substantial"" interest.The UTRUST API is aimed at online and point-of-sale crypto acceptance worldwide. This set of tools will also include a conflict mitigation system, chargeback protection, and a proprietary cryptocurrency which increases purchasing power within the platform. While UTRUST has their sights set on assisting global retailers in the use of crypto it has decided to launch its business in Europe.The company has signed strategic partnerships in Europe to establish a ""beachhead"" for further expansion. One such partnership is Gambio.de, a German e-commerce solution provider with more than 25,000 online stores. According to UTRUST´s estimates, Gambio-powered stores generate about 30 percent of e-commerce revenue in Germany and therefore are in a powerful starting position for UTRUST to expand across the continent.UTRUST says these partnerships mean that from the first day of operation, thousands of merchants will be able to accept cryptocurrencies in a simplified way, while receiving fiat currencies in their bank accounts. Furthermore, UTRUST customers will have access to a proprietary digital wallet which allows zero fee transactions. The company believes, the large amount of merchants will offset the lower figures of cryptocurrency use, gaining UTRUST a substantial foot-hold in the on coming crypto economy. The company intends to help all businesses it interacts with, and rise with the tide of cryptocurrencies.“In three years, you will be able to pay online [with cryptocurrencies] at major vendors. This will come offline in another five years,” said Filipe Castro, UTRUST’s Chief Information Officer and co-founder,  Cointelegraph. “I am a strong believer that in the future, in ten years, you will have state–issued cryptocurrencies from major economies”, - added Mr. Castro. And at that moment, UTRUST expects to be already there for them “on the ground”.  UTRUST protocol also has a built-in mechanism for dispute resolution. Specifically, UTRUST arbiters may step in to mediate between the buyer and the seller, if they don’t agree on a refund or release of funds in 30 days.While several companies like BitPay or Coinbase have risen to the challenge of bridging the gap between crypto and traditional vendors, UTRUST differentiates itself as ""the first cryptocurrency payment solution to offer instant transactions, buyer protection, and crypto-to-cash settlements."" In a marketplace which is often seen as too volatile for both merchants and users, an offer to bring peace of mind to both may indeed make a difference. UTRUST hopes to become the ""PayPal of Crypto"" by offering protection for both buyers and sellers. It also provides the added benefit of refunds paid in crypto in case of a dispute. Also, while PayPal protects only physical goods, UTRUST extends its security proposition to include services, too. UTRUST recently announced that the former eBay head of European partnerships and Head of Marketplaces and Large Enterprise Partnerships for PayPal in the U.K, Sanja Kon, has joined the company. UTRUST believes that this addition to the team will lend much needed traditional e-commerce expertise in bridging the gap between digital and fiat currencies.The company says, this, combined with 1 percent merchant fees, promises to trigger a feedback cycle of more customers bringing more merchants into cryptocurrency, and so on ad infinitum.UTRUST was successfully funded with $21.3 million in crypto in 2017, it is slated for commercial launch in Q1 2019. So far, the company says its roadmap is ahead of schedule.  It is the belief of the company that its dispute resolution system, one percent merchant fees, and simple interface will be enough to bring merchants and customers into the global crypto ecosystem.Disclaimer.

The news was announced in an official blog post today, Nov. 6.","Blockchain.com pitched the mammoth offering as “the largest airdrop in the history of crypto and likely the largest consumer giveaway ever,” suggesting that airdrops are “a great way to drive decentralization and adoption for new networks.”The firm underscores that the benefit of crypto airdrops for consumers are that they are able to “test, trade, and transact” unfamiliar crypto assets without having to mine or invest first.Blockchain.com gives the rationale for its choice to launch support for Stellar as being due to the token’s network being “built for scalability,” as well as for its provision of the ability to create custom tokens that represent “real-world or virtual goods and services.”Prior to adding Stellar support, the Blockchain.com wallet already supported three other cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin (BTC),  Bitcoin Cash (BCH), and Ethereum (ETH).As of press time, Stellar (XLM) is ranked sixth largest cryptocurrency by market cap on CoinMarketCap’s listings, seeing a strong 5.35 percent growth on the day, trading at $0.258.In late September, Cointelegraph reported that Blockchain.com had been ranked within the top ten most “sought-after” U.K. startup employers in new listings on LinkedIn. Among its attributes, LinkedIn noted Blockchain.com’s “benefits such as free food and flexible working,” unlimited holiday policy and a bonus scheme for employees paid in Bitcoin.Airdrops have recently made headlines in less auspicious terms, with China’s stringently anti-crypto central bank, the People’s Bank of China (PBoC), announcing it would be widening its regulatory scrutiny to include token airdrops, which it characterized as “disguised” Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) in its 2018 financial stability report."

In April its CEO, Lisa Su, said blockchain was “a very important technology” with high potential in terms of transactions. Nonetheless, according to the AMD CEO, in the short term, the tech caused “a bit of distraction.”"

Gate.io claimed they subsequently scanned the website with 56 antivirus products, and “no one reported any suspicious behavior at that time.” However, the firm still changed its traffic tracker, also reporting that “users’ funds are safe.”On Nov. 6, Slovakia-based cybersecurity firm ESET published a security report claiming that hackers had successfully breached major web analytics tool StatCounter, targeting Bitcoin (BTC) exchanges that use the traffic analytic service. According to ESET researcher Matthieu Faou, the attackers compromised the StatCounter platform — which is reportedly used by more than two million other websites — by modifying the JavaScript (JS) code on each page of the website.The hackers managed to add a piece of malicious code containing “myaccount/withdraw/BTC,” which intends to replace the destination address of a Bitcoin transfers by crypto exchange users with an address belonging to the attackers.Modified script at www.statcounter[.]com/counter/counter.js.

blockchains store their transactions in different blocks — say, Bitcoin 
(BTC) ...","Oct 14, 2018","On October 9, American financial services giant Mastercard was granted a patent for a method to partition a blockchain so that it can store multiple transaction types and formats. The filing published by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) reveals the details of the new system — not the first of the kind for Mastercard.","Simply put, different blockchains store their transactions in different blocks — say, Bitcoin (BTC) uses one kind of system to record data on its blockchain, while Ethereum (ETH) opts for alternative metrics.Now, imagine a company that wants to use blockchain technology to store different kinds of data or use multiple cryptocurrencies for their business. It will have to run multiple blockchains, because, as per the recent patent’s filing, the transaction records are “often required to be of the same format and include the same types, and sometimes even sizes, of data.” Consequently, this company will also have to be able to afford all the extra resources and computing power involved.This problem might be caused by varying degrees of permissioned or open access of blockchains. On the one hand, there are non-permissioned blockchains that allow anyone to view record or be part of it — just like the aforementioned BTC and ETH with their public ledgers. On the other hand, they can also be permissioned — those require special permissions to read, access, and write information on them. They are more common among industry-level corporations, for whom security, identity and role definition are crucial.Mastercard’s new patent claims the inflexibility of blockchains in terms of data formatting restricts the usage of permissions on permissioned blockchains:“[...] an entity may want to operate a permissioned blockchain, where varying levels of permissions may be used for participation in the blockchain, such as by limiting the nodes that may add new blocks to the blockchain. However, because all transactions in a traditional blockchain are formatted similarly, the permissions may not be extended to access to the actual transactions in the blockchain … The patent authors say their partitioned blockchain could bypass such limitations and provide ‘enhanced usage of permissions’.Mastercard’s new system aims to expand blockchain’s utility by allowing blocks to receive data from “a plurality of subnets”.“Subnets” are proposed partitions, which would be internally consistent but would interact in a wider, single system: “a subnet may have rules about data in a transaction record, the organization of the data, the size of each data value, and the hashing algorithms used in the formulation of the subnet’s merkle root.” Therefore, subnets would be able to receive information from different computing devices and allow to add data of any kind and size without following a standardized data format. However, the amount of subnets is limited, as the proposed system supports a maximum of three.Mastercard first applied for the above mentioned patent back in July 2016 — it is a time consuming process. The patent office publishes applications up to 18 months after they are filed, and it can take years to decide whether to grant patent protection.However, the grant for a partitioned blockchain is just one of many for Mastercard. Its first blockchain-related patent was approved in November 2017 titled ""method and system for instantaneous payment using recorded guarantees"". Since then, the company has come a long way in terms of studying the technology: according to IRP Daily’s August report titled “2018 Top 100 Global Blockchain Patent Enterprise Ranking”, the American credit giant is the third largest with a hefty 80 patent filings, surpassed only by Alibaba and IBM, which makes it a key participant of the potentially forthcoming patent war in the field of blockchain.Just last month, USPTO published Mastercard’s series of three similarly-written patent applications, where the company argued that the distributed ledger technology (DLT) could significantly simplify business-to-business (B2B) transactions, noting that “21st century B2B collaboration sits on an unwieldy, unconnected and largely unchanged mid-20th century B2B payments platform”. Blockchain, in turn, as the patent authors argued, would store data in a system that is easily accessible by involved firms and is highly-resistant to forging.Previously in July 2018, Mastercard filed a patent for consumer protection and payment transactions based on DLT. In it, the company described the form of a public blockchain-based method for linking assets between blockchain and fiat currency accounts.Securing blockchain-related patents does not necessarily mean that the company will go on to create those new systems — whilst blockchain remains a relatively new field, some players just want to stake their claim before taking action. For instance, Bank of America — another top patent applicant — so far have prioritized having a registered technology over actually using it.In 2016, Catherine Bessant, chief operations and technology officer at Bank of America, told CNBC that having blockchain-related patents is “very important … to reserve our spot even before we know what the commercial application might be.” Notably, those endeavors didn’t prevent the company from calling Bitcoin ‘troubling’ and uplifting its decision to ban customers from purchasing crypto.The notable activity of Mastercard towards blockchain is backed by the ambitious statements, highlighting the company’s fundamental interest to the technology. In September, Ken Moore, the executive vice president and head of Mastercard Labs, told The Irish Times — on of the biggest Irish daily newspapers —the company’s Dublin-based unit was going “beyond the hype that surrounds new technologies such as blockchain to develop real, grounded services and products” that would be introduced the wider group. “This is not exploratory work for us,” he added, following Mastercard’s announcement that it plans to create 175 new jobs in Dublin with “new roles including blockchain specialists, data scientists and cloud infrastructure specialists”."

While the deals’ sizes remain undisclosed, JMP is cited by CNBC as saying that the “majority” are “relatively small” – less than $100 million – and are “global in nature.”The major upswing comes as Bitcoin (BTC) is trading almost 53 percent lower than at the start of the year, according to data from CoinMarketCap.Conversely, 2017 reportedly saw just 47 deals in total, as Bitcoin soared to hit its record high of $20,000 in December of that year.JMP Securities' head of blockchain and digital assets investment banking, Satya Bajpai, told CNBC in an interview that the so-called “crypto winter” presents an opportune moment for those eyeing access to innovative tech, intellectual property and talent in the emerging space.Bajpai further suggested that the downturn in Bitcoin is depressing prices market-wide, arguing that:""You're seeing a mispricing of assets. Even for great businesses, the value of the token remains correlated to bitcoin, which can create an ideal opportunity for strategic acquirers.""Bajpai further characterized the heightened deal activity as something of a “land grab,” whereby the rapid pace of innovation in the sector pushes parties to opt for buying instead of starting from scratch:“""[The M&A route is] expensive, but you get the technology and product immediately. This industry is like a treadmill – the only way to keep up on a treadmill is to keep running by investing in new technology.""Moreover, M&A offer a short-cut to access an existing user base or community, Bajpai suggests, contributing to the perception that M&A deals are “the most viable and fastest way to grow” in the new space.Nonetheless, there are specific “challenges” posed by the new sector, he added: while Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) tokenize incentives, ownership, or a stake in a developing platform or service, institutional investors may prefer to buy a traditional equity stake in a given project, rather than invest in the associated token.Other commentators have expressed similar views that the bear market is viewed as a favorable moment for institutional entry into the space; commenting on Twitter earlier this month, venture capital investor Garry Tan argued that the “crypto winter […] makes it safer for super-long-term oriented Yale-model institutions to enter at a price that isn’t dangerous.”"

You can know 80-90 percent of the time, but it’s impossible to know 100 percent.”2018 started with the industry-record-breaking $532 million hack of Japanese crypto exchange Coincheck, which seems to account for over half of CipherTrace’s rolling 2018 figure.Earlier today, Cointelegraph reported that another hacked Japanese exchange, Zaif — which suffered a theft resulting in losses of crypto worth around $59.7 million this September — has just released its official plan to provide financial support for affected customers’ assets."

currencies or various cryptocurrencies on a multitude of exchanges, the use 
of ...","Oct 17, 2018","This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.","Tether, a cryptocurrency that has long been a point of contention in the community, has seemingly been uppegged from the US Dollar.The stablecoin, by virtue of that very description, was linked to the US Dollar at a 1:1 ratio. Simply put, every Tether token that was minted had to be backed by a US Dollar.Concerns around the validity of Tether’s reserves of fiat currency corresponding to the circulating amount of tokens seem to have taken its toll. On October 15, the cryptocurrency dipped below the $1 mark amid a wave of negative sentiment that has led to an apparent sell-off of Tether tokens.Another factor that may have influenced the drop in value of Tether was a report at the beginning of the month which stated that both Tether and Bitfinex, the exchange responsible for issuing the tokens, had parted ways with Noble Bank in Puerto Rico.This was followed by Bitfinex temporarily suspending fiat wire deposits - with no specific reason given for the decision. It could well be that the closure of its Puerto Rican bank account has exacerbated the situation.Tether is still trading below $1 according to data from CoinMarketCap.Image source: CoinMarketCapTether, as it is known today, was launched in November 2014, after it was rebranded from the original project Realcoin.The project was initially founded by Bitcoin Foundation director Brock Pierce, alongside software engineer Craig Sellars, and entrepreneur Reeve Collins. The RealCoin startup laid the foundation for Tether’s operation before the name change came about.The premise of the cryptocurrency was simple, to provide a utility token that represented certain fiat currencies at a 1:1 ratio, with the benefits of cross-border payments facilitated by blockchain technology.The cryptocurrency was built and operated using an OmniLayer platform, a software layer built on the Bitcoin protocol. Thus, every time new Tether tokens were issued, these could be tracked on the platform, allowing the wider cryptocurrency community to keep tabs on how many new Tethers were released.Tether has had an interesting association with Hong Kong based exchange platform Bitfinex. The exchange integrated Tether into its operation in January 2015, but the relationship has come under intense scrutiny over the last few years.According to Tether’s official website, the company shares the same leadership as Bitfinex. JL van der Velde is CEO of both companies, and Giancarlo Devasini is the chief financial operator of both operations as well.The main reason for this has been spikes in the value of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies following the periodic issuance of new Tether tokens. Critics have claimed that the newly minted tokens were being used to prop up or manipulate the value of other cryptocurrencies.While there is nothing to stop people from buying Bitcoin with fiat currencies or various cryptocurrencies on a multitude of exchanges, the use of Tether to do this has been disconcerting for one major reason.Since its inception, Tether has asserted that it always has the necessary fiat reserves to back all circulating tokens in the market. The website even provides a real-time ledger of Tether tokens in conjunction with their underlying monetary reserve.Tether’s account balances according to the ‘Transparency’ page on its website. Source: TetherHowever, there have been claims that not all Tether tokens which are issued, have the necessary fiat currency reserve to back it up.While Tether’s balance sheet on its website claims to provide a transparent reflection of its accounts, Tether has failed to complete an audit of its accounts by a third-party - which was promised in 2017.The crypto community began to put pressure on the company to conduct a full audit to allay fears of inadequate cash reserves to the number of Tether tokens. To this end, Tether acquired the services of Friedman LLP to conduct a short review of its account balances.Following that, the company published a memo of a short report from Friedman LLP with the company’s accounts - in the hopes of appeasing the concerns of various parties online:“We hope that the community considers the attached memorandum for what it is: a good faith effort on our behalf to provide an interim analysis of our cash position and our issued and outstanding tokens, as part of ongoing efforts to further professionalize the transparency mechanisms of Tether Limited.”As various critiques came out in public, Bitfinex eventually threatened legal action against parties that were questioning the authenticity of their operation in November 2017.Both Bitfinex and Tether then received government subpoenas in December 2017 from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in response to the concerns raised towards the end of the year.With the pressure firmly on, Tether got Friedman back to conduct a full audit in January 2018. But less than a month into the process, Tether stopped the auditing process, claiming that it wouldn’t be completed in a reasonable period of time, according to Bloomberg:“Given the excruciatingly detailed procedures Friedman was undertaking for the relatively simple balance sheet of Tether, it became clear that an audit would be unattainable in a reasonable timeframe.”Following the dissolved relationship between Tether and Friedman LLP, Bitmex released a report that speculated that Tether had the necessary cash reserves in a bank account in Puerto Rico.While that report may have settled some concerns around the validity of Tether’s claims, a research paper published in June from the University of Texas blamed Tether for Bitcoin price manipulation in 2017.By using algorithms to analyze market data, the report claimed that purchases with Tether were timed after downturns in the cryptocurrency markets which resulted in price increases in the value of Bitcoin.In the same month, a law firm in the US released a report stating the Tether did actually have the adequate reserve of fiat currency to back tokens in circulation. Law firm Freeh Sporkin &  Sullivan LLP had access to two of Tether’s bank accounts to release its findings - which were not an official audit.In response to the report, Tether’s general counsel Stuart Hoegner told Bloomberg that mainstream accounting firms would not conduct official audits on companies working with cryptocurrencies:“The bottom line is an audit cannot be obtained [...] The big four firms are anathema to that level of risk. We’ve gone for what we think is the next best thing.”Despite all of this media attention, Tether tokens have continued to be issued through the year, according to data from Omni Explorer.Source: Omni ExplorerIn August, more than $500 million worth of tokens were released, but the focus of many reports was on the apparent lack of effect this had on market prices these issuances were having.While Tether has long been hailed as the original stablecoin pegged to the US Dollar, its duopoly with TrueUSD, has been disrupted by the approval of two new stablecoins linked to the Dollar.In September, Paxos and Gemini launched two new stablecoins called the Gemini dollar (GUSD) and the Paxos Standard (PAX), which are both backed by the US dollar on a 1:1 ratio.Both stablecoins are based on the Ethereum blockchain using ERC-20 token standards, which also ensures full transparency of these coins, as Ethereum can verify the smart contract of both ERC-20 tokens.This should also rule out the need for third-party service providers and exchanges in order to make transactions with these stablecoins.An overarching theme of the Tether saga has been the lack of trustworthy transparency when it comes to the necessary reserves of fiat currency to back-up newly minted coins.To date, Tether has not undertaken or released an official third party audit of its accounts. While the community would love to give them the benefit of the doubt, hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent on Tether tokens and this necessitates a transparent and trustworthy audit.If the company had carried out this process, at whatever cost and given timeframe, all fears could have been allayed. The failure to do so has led to serious uncertainty, the consequences of which are apparent in the current valuation of Tether tokens.The launch of new stablecoins by highly reputable service providers has the potential to provide a viable alternative to Tether. The pressure is firmly on the company to prove it is running a transparent operation."

The consortium is going to present the new platform at the Singapore Fintech Festival, which will take place from Nov. 12-14.FISCO BCOS is described as a set of applications aimed to serve the general public. Per the release, the main strength of the new platform lies in the speed of transactions per second (TPS), which is expected to reach more than 1000. FISCO also claims its blockchain will use Byzantine fault tolerance protocol and also support Zero-knowledge proof.The consortium stresses that the blockchain network will also contain “observatory” nodes through which regulators and auditors would be able to monitor or access data whenever needed.Huawei has previously worked on decentralized projects in collaboration with Hyperledger — an open source blockchain operation created by the Linux Foundation in 2015.In March, Hyperledger launched its Caliper service — a blockchain benchmark tool allowing users to measure the performance of a specific blockchain implementation, with development contribution from Huawei. In April, Huawei released its Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) tool, based on the Hyperledger blockchain, that could help developers create and deploy services on Huawei Cloud.Also this spring, Huawei announced the users of its mobile phone will be able to download Bitcoin (BTC) wallets on their devices, with the wallets set to be pre-installed on all new Huawei smartphones.Tencent has previously participated in the blockchain space as well. In June, the tech giant partnered with Chinese officials to create the China Blockchain Security Alliance, which will consist of more than 20 public and private institutions — including government advisory agencies — and will develop secure mechanisms to deploy blockchain all over the country."

I hope we can bring minds together on this so that we can get over this hurdle.”Singapore has made a name for itself in recent years as a broadly welcoming jurisdiction regarding disruptive fintech, with Menon publicly showing support for the promise of both cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.At the same time, he remains prudent about the emerging sector, noting to Bloomberg that from a bank’s perspective, he still “would not blame” executives for continuing to refuse to service crypto clients.“Some of these activities are indeed quite opaque,” he added.Last year, reports emerged of extant cryptocurrency entities in Singapore suddenly having their bank accounts closed by local lenders.Nevertheless, Singapore’s position continues to differ markedly from official stance in countries such as India, where a blanket ban on banks dealing with crypto businesses continues.After a raft of complaints, the country’s supreme court is now soon due to deliver a verdict on the ban’s legal legitimacy."

Amamiya also stated that the BOJ does not plan to issue digital currencies.The article reports that some financial experts consider a CBDC as a tool for central banks to control the economy once interest rates fall to zero. According to this theory, a CBDC would enable central banks to stimulate the economy by charging more interest on deposits from individuals and firms, which would in turn induce them to spend more money.Amamiya has questioned that theory, claiming that charging interest on central banks-issued currencies would only work if central banks eliminate fiat money from the financial system. Otherwise, the public will still continue converting digital currencies into cash in order to avoid paying interest:""In order for central banks to overcome the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates, they would need to get rid of cash from society.”In turn, the elimination of fiat money in Japan is “not an option for us as a central bank,” since cash is still a popular method of payment in the country, Amamiya claimed.The BOJ deputy governor stressed that the bank is not planning creating a CBDC that can be widely used by the public for settlement and payment purposes. The shift to bank-issued crypto from the existing sovereign currencies is considered ""quite a high hurdle,” while crypto assets are often associated with speculative investments and do not represent a stable means of payment, he noted.In April, Amamiya provided a similar sceptical statement on CBDCs, claiming that a state-backed crypto could have a negative impact on the existing financial system. However, that time, Amamiya claimed that the bank was still eyeing emerging fintech like crypto in the future.Earlier this week, a Japanese taxation policy committee held a discussion aiming to facilitate the cryptocurrency tax reporting process, with participants calling to alleviate the existing complex tax filing regime.On Oct. 16, Japan’s messaging giant LINE launched trading of its recently-developed LINK (LN) token on its native BITBOX cryptocurrency exchange."

Its bot is free to use, and the company hopes to ensure capitalizing on fluctuations in cryptocurrencies doesn’t need to be a full-time job.The team behind the Santa Bot says it takes about 10 minutes to set it up and configure the user’s desired trading parameters – such as pairings and profit targets. Detailed tutorials are provided to guide them through every step of the process.A bot’s ability to trade is delivered through API keys from supported crypto exchanges, and the platform says this means it cannot access user funds or withdraw them without permission. At present, the Santa Bot supports six exchanges, including Poloniex, Binance, Bittrex, Bitfinex, KuCoin and HitBTC.Unlimited numbers of bots and trading pairs are available to users, and they are also able to perform long and short strategies simultaneously if they so wish. Technical indicators enable the bot to open deals at optimal moments to maximize potential profitability.The company says bots can place up to 100 times more orders when compared to users who trade manually, and this is because bots can track market movements for dozens of trading pairs simultaneously. All of this can happen 24 hours a day, all year round without permanent attention from the user.Trade Santa says it has protections in place should automated trades not go to plan. Extra orders involve a bot buying a specified number of tokens to compensate for unexpected shifts in the market and move take profit orders accordingly.Its founders argue that automated trading helps to remove emotion from the process – helping investors to avoid chasing losses or making bad decisions in the heat of the moment.Given the 24-hour nature of the crypto trading world, where dramatic swings in price happen at any time of the day or night, it is hoped the bot will help investors to stay on top of market movements even if they’re away from their computer or asleep.Through the Trade Santa interface, users are able to review the most successful pairs on each exchange over the past 24 hours – or for more immediate analysis, over a three, six or 12-hour period.A dashboard enables crypto enthusiasts to get a summary of how their bots are performing. In addition to showing estimated calculated profits, users can see the deals currently in progress, their balance in Bitcoin, and the USDT/BTC exchange rate.Support is provided through the platform’s Telegram community, and a live chat service can be found on the website, which is unsurprisingly known as “Santa’s Helper.”Although automation can have its advantages, many experts caution against relying on them altogether. This is because they often can’t react to developments in the news – where a tweet from a crypto company can have huge ramifications for a coin’s price, upwards or downwards. Getting the right results also hinges upon extensive backtesting, where strategies are applied to historical data to get a feel for what the outcome would have been in the past. Even then, past performance cannot always accurately indicate what lies ahead in the future.As Trade Santa gains traction in the crypto community, the team says its platform will remain free.

Sarhangi reportedly joined Google in 2015 when the tech giant acquired Jibe Mobile, a startup that he founded to develop technology for wireless carriers to implement rich communication system (RCS).The RCS technology standard is considered to be a successor to text messages (SMS) as a better method to send media and commercial messages over cell networks. According to Reuters, RCS technology has seen broad adoption by major global tech suppliers such as Apple and Samsung.The announcement follows the recent report by Ripple that the company has seen its revenues doubled in the third quarter over Q2 in 2018. According to the official data, Ripple has sold $163.33 million worth of XRP in token sales in Q3, which is more than double the $73.53 million that they sold in previous quarter.In late September, Ripple set up a group of crypto startups in order to lobby lawmakers and financial regulators aiming to assist in taking a softer governmental stance towards crypto-related industries. According to the agreement, Ripple will pay Klein/Johnson Group, a bipartisan lobby group, to convey to state authorities that the industry needs support from regulators.In early October, crypto exchange and wallet Coinbase announced that a member of the board of directors of the Charles Schwab Corporation had joined the crypto firms’ board of directors.Also in October, the former COO of major U.S. stock exchange Nasdaq subsidiary Jeanine Hightower-Sellitto joined crypto exchange Gemini as their managing directors of operations to lead its client services team."

the largest cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH).","Nov 6, 2018","BaseCore, a US-based blockchain project, reveals a new security token concept which allows investing in private IT companies, like Uber, AirBnB and Grab, among others.","According to the project’s whitepaper, the BaseCore token is backed by a portfolio containing the assets of private IT companies. These assets are impossible to purchase on the stock market, as the companies are not public. The paper states, “This feature of the token allows it to become one of the most stable digital currencies on the market.”The BaseCore company aims to purchase shares from private IT companies and tokenize them by creating digital assets – the BaseCore security token. Additionally, the company has created its own exchange platform for buying, selling, and exchanging security tokens.The BaseCore token is a dual-purpose investment tool: it will include investments in the asset market, in the form of private IT companies, as well as the potential growth of the largest cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). The financial model of the BaseCore business assumes a dollar-based system of payment when making financial investments in private companies.“In practice, this means that unlike most of the alternatives proposed, buyers of the BaseCore token who exchange it for BTC and ETH are given an additional opportunity to invest in the private IT companies market. It also ensures retaining all the possible profit if the value of ‘dollar’ or ‘fiat’ invested in the cryptocurrency token grows,” reads the white paper.The BaseCore platform works on the Excalibur exchange protocol which provides the exchange of ERC-20 standard tokens. Excalibur works as a decentralized open API exchange created with the implementation of a secure Inter-Planetary File System (IPFS) protocol.“Currently, most decentralized exchanges are not completely decentralized and have basic problems concerning the security and availability of the interface on the server,” notes the BaseCore team. The team representatives point out that, for example, on the EtherDelta and TokenStore platforms, the interface does not correspond with UX trends. Furthermore, in the TokenStore, with certain skills, a user can place an order which exceeds the remaining balance on the platform, or execute an offline order (knowing the hash), even if it was previously cancelled.In order to avoid such problems, BaseCore implemented a basic asset exchange algorithm taking into account all the flaws of other decentralized exchanges. For instance, the IPFS protocol allows any user to quickly access the interface, regardless of the server performance and so on. The IPFS also prevents DDOS attacks and similar actions that exchanges often face.Each new IPFS release of Excalibur has a unique hash, which excludes the possibility of the source code spoofing. The community can verify the current hash or download the local version of the exchange. “In the future, we plan to abandon classic hosting and release versions only for local use and launch on IPFS,” states the BaseCore team.The interface of the BaseCore platform features an intuitive, single page application and a mobile adaptive design. The company plans to add tools for working with portfolios and other security asset statistics. Among the upcoming updates is a dashboard with a detailed balance, the ability to make private exchanges using a hash, conditional execution of automatic orders, the ability to create fiat deposits through the creation of an inner stablecoin, and much more. Moreover, the BaseCore platform will include a verification mechanism ensuring compliance of token vendors and accredited status of token buyers, in addition to the standard Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering procedures.At this stage, Excalibur is completing registration, obtaining an EMI license and other necessary trading licenses.As BaseCore reported to Cointelegraph, the Excalibur project is currently at the stage of closed alpha testing, though an invite can be obtained via their GitHub link, The local IPFS version at GitHub is available for download as well.Disclaimer.

According to the February suspension order, Cherubim is alleged to have issued press releases in January claiming it had acquired “AAA-rated assets from a subsidiary of a private equity investor in cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.”The SEC has also pointed to the firm’s failure to file reports for the fiscal year ending August 2017, as well as a quarterly report last November.The SEC stated yesterday that despite issuing subpoenas to both St. James Trust and James in June 2018, and having “personally served” the trustee with copies of the subpoenas, and extended deadlines “multiple times,” neither the trust nor the trustee responded to the agency, nor produced the necessary documents. The agency therefore seeks an order from the court compelling both to produce all responsive documents.The agency emphasizes, however, that it continues its fact-finding investigation in this matter and, “to date, has not concluded that anyone has violated securities laws.”At the end of September, Cointelegraph reported that the SEC had filed charges against an international securities dealer that was offering Bitcoin-funded security-based swaps, in an alleged violation of federal securities laws."

Bitcoin (BTC), including CFDs, futures, options and transferable securities.","Oct 29, 2018",The U.K. Cryptoassets Taskforce has released a report Oct. 29 that proposes some changes for cryptocurrency regulation and raises concerns over how digital assets are traded and used.,"Launched in March, the Cryptoassets Taskforce is made up of of the Bank of England (BOE) and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and is charged to regulate and support crypto technologies.Since there is no widely agreed definition of a cryptoasset and given that cryptoassets significantly vary in the rights they provide to their holders, the Taskforce has developed a framework that considers three types of cryptoassets. Those include cryptoassets used as a means of exchange, for investment, and to support capital raising and development of decentralized networks through Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs).The Taskforce’s cryptoassets framework. Source: U.K. Cryptoassets TaskforcePer the report, cryptoassets used as a means of exchange can not be recognized as a currency or money due to high volatility, poor acceptance as means of exchange, and failure of use as a unit of account. However, the agency notes that cryptoasset deployment can allow more efficient and cheaper transactions thanks the elimination of intermediaries in the future.When used as an investment, cryptoassets can reportedly have the potential to widen access to new investment opportunities, though in the current market state, it can expose consumers to inappropriate levels of risks, including risks associated with illicit activity, the report says.Regarding ICOs, the agency has concluded that they have the potential to present a number of opportunities, including supporting innovation and competition, improving efficiency, addressing financing gaps, and building a new investor and customer base.Cryptocurrency contracts for difference (CFDs) and futures can, per the report, cause losses which can subsequently be intensified by product fees such as financing costs and spreads, and lack of transparency in the price establishment of the underlying cryptoasset. In this respect, the FCA proposes the following prohibition:“Given concerns identified around consumer protection and market integrity in these markets, the FCA will consult on a prohibition of the sale to retail consumers of all derivatives referencing exchange tokens such as Bitcoin (BTC), including CFDs, futures, options and transferable securities. The proposed prohibition would not cover derivatives referencing cryptoassets that qualify as securities, however CFDs on securities would remain subject to [the European Security and Market Authority’s] temporary restrictions and any future FCA proposals to implement permanent measures in relation to CFDs.”Further, the FSA will reportedly not authorize the listing of transferable securities or a fund that references to exchange tokens unless it has confidence in the integrity of the underlying market and compliance with other regulatory criteria.Though the Taskforce has indicated that cryproassets pose a range of risks to consumers, market integrity due to manipulation, and other market-abuse issues, it also notes that the situation may change in the future.The agency proposes Financial Promotions rules applying to regulated firms, which would give a “balanced impression” of the product or service, while not disguising and diminishing important warning statements.Earlier today, a joint report from the British Business Federation Authority (BBFA), venture capital fund Novum Insights, and cryptocurrency exchange TodaQ urged caution about overly strict regulation in the U.K. The report says that “bad regulation is worse than no regulation at all,” with the implication of knock-on effects for the wider U.K. fintech scene."

It reportedly has a presence in twelve countries, and holds the market share of over 13 percent of Saudi Investment Companies licensed by the country’s Capital Markets Authority (CMA), and over 21 percent of the Cooperative Insurance Firms Listed on the Saudi stock-exchange market.The debate over whether or not cryptocurrencies are Sharia-compliant has centered on their compatibility with the Islamic prohibition on sheer monetary speculation. Reuters notes that some Islamic scholars have deemed crypto trading to be analogous with the “transfer of rights,” which is legitimate under Sharia law.According to X8 director and co-founder, Francesca Greco, X8’s ETH-based crypto asset is a “stablecoin,” whose backing by a basket of eight fiat currencies and gold is considered to assuage Islamic advisors’ concerns over excessive volatility and speculation.As part of its plans to expand its business to the Middle East, X8 reportedly plans to launch a crypto exchange that would include a Sharia-compliant trading platform. To this end, Greco told Reuters that the company has met with local exchanges in Abu Dhabi, Dubai, and Bahrain. “The Gulf region is a really good place for financial technology companies, because they all want to become hubs for fintech,” she added.As reported this July, altcoin Stellar (XLM) received a Sharia compliance certification in the money transfer and asset tokenization field, claiming to be the first blockchain protocol to have done so.

The coin has reportedly been rebranded a number of times, going by various names such as HOLD, HUZU, or Stellar. The latter should not be confused with the XLM token.According to the report, the HOLD coin has been listed and delisted on a series of crypto exchanges, eventually defrauding investors in a scam staking scheme.The second scam coin dubbed Marine Chain coin was detected in a “couple of Bitcoin forums” in August 2018. The coin, which supposedly enabled the tokenization of maritime vessels for multiple users and owners, was claimed to be fraudulent by the state of Ontario, Canada.A slew of users complained about the loss of tens of thousands of dollars and scams on the website, which was hosted at four different IP addresses since its registration.

Crypto Platform Sees Its User Base Grow Amid the Global Pandemic.","Nov 10, 2018",Crypto games are all the rage right now – but for all of the talk about collectibles one blockchain startup says there’s a key element which is being overlooked: skill.,"Ether Kingdoms believes gamers want more than an opportunity to collect virtual assets – and it has created an “exciting and engrossing game that can make real money for the player.” At the heart of its universe are imps – “the kingdom’s main workers and warriors.” They can go mining for IMP tokens – with one IMP equal to a warrior under your command. Each imp has distinctive characteristics, and gamers can send them into battle against other players if they wish. Victory means they will walk away with some of their imps.Rare and desirable artefacts are available throughout the game, and these have the potential to make the imps stronger – giving players the upper hand when they’re challenging someone. These artefacts can be hard to find, but Ether Kingdoms does offer weekly leaderboards, with winners receiving a coveted loot box full of tools.Although Ether Kingdoms is based on blockchain technology, its team admits some elements of the game do not use smart contracts. In explaining why this is, they point to CryptoKitties – which soared to become the largest DApp on the Ethereum protocol by gas consumption. As a result, it put a strain on the entire network and created severe congestion.Ether Kingdoms says its solution delivers a “fast and secure” gameplay experience where mining and battles won’t cost astronomical amounts of gas. While the MetaMask wallet is used for verifying all of the key actions that a player performs in the game, all other operations are stored on a server to make the game fast and free – creating a balance between “productivity, reliability and transparency.”When it comes to the mining element of the game, players can open access to new mines as they advance through levels. More experience mean more IMP tokens can be rendered on a daily basis. Battles are crucial in racking up experience points, and over time, the number of imps gamers can dedicate to a fight increases. When they start to reach the top of the game, it is possible to risk it all by sending as many as 500 imps into battle.To ensure a player always has someone to battle on demand, Ether Kingdoms has created “highly trained bots” which imitate the characteristics of imps and create an “absolutely equal” chance of victory. This ensures that gamers will never be left waiting for someone to come online before they can start fighting.Bosses have also recently been unveiled. In a blog post, the startup explained: “Bosses are unique creatures that have set characteristics  –  for each level range there will be its own personal boss, which will appear on the map for a limited amount of time and the player will have to beat them to get a cool prize. Most likely, you’ll be able to beat a boss in a dozen or so tries.”A minimum viable product version of Ether Kingdoms was released back in May. Since then, a raft of new features have been added – with dozens of new artefacts up for grabs. By the end of this year, players will be able to engage in a completely new game mode – Exploring Area, where they can fight with other players for different objects and explore dungeons.Starting in 2019, global game events for groups are going to be launched – and players will be able to organize themselves into clans and do battle for “the rarest artefacts and the most valuable prizes.” Another crucial milestone will be the release of the game’s mobile version – but as most app stores do not allow cryptocurrency-related games, its tokens are not going to be supported on this platform.Disclaimer.

With 15 Major Banks",https://cointelegraph.com/news/wall-streets-bookkeeper-enters-test-phase-of-dlt-replatforming-along-with-15-major-banks,"In early November, Morgan Stanley released a report updating its clients 
about Bitcoin and blockchain, documenting several industry giants ...","Nov 16, 2018","On Nov. 6, the post-trade market infrastructure behemoth, the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC), announced that it is entering the test phase of its attempt to replatform its Trade Information Warehouse (TIW) via the use of distributed ledger technology (DLT).","The move to a blockchain platform comes at a time when many financial institutions are trialling the technology. In early November, Morgan Stanley released a report updating its clients about Bitcoin and blockchain, documenting several industry giants who have either already implemented blockchain or are in the process of trialling it. The report named ING Bank, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan, and several other as being in the various stages of trials.The DTCC’s attempt to shift its TIW to the blockchain is an ambitious project due to the fact that it accounts for 98 percent of derivatives transactions worldwide. In the statement, the DTCC sheds light on the scale of their current operations, stating that the DTCC’s subsidiaries “processed securities transactions valued at more than U.S. $1.61 quadrillion.” The DTCC valued its current current custodian and asset servicing solutions used in 131 countries and territories at U.S. for $57.4 trillion. Furthermore, the release stated that the DTCC’s Global Trade Repository service processes around 40 million open over-the-counter (OTC) positions weekly, along with 1 billion communications monthly, through its licensed trade repositories group.According to the press release published on Nov. 6, the DTCC is working alongside 15 of the world’s leading banks to test the DLT based replatforming of the warehouse.The press release only names the U.K.-based Barclays bank as participating in the 2018 test, leaving the remaining 14 anonymous. JPMorgan, Credit Suisse, Citi, and Bank of America were participant banks in the DTCC’s 2016 proof-of-concept (PoC), however, it is not at this point known if any are still involved in the ongoing project.Lee Braine, of the Chief Technology Office at Barclays, explained the aims of the project in the DTCC’s press release:“We are pleased to be working with DTCC, our partners and colleagues on this exciting project to bring distributed ledger technology to life in a demonstrable way that will enhance efficiencies and lower costs and risks for the industry.”The press release also reveals details about the nature of the trials underway. The replatforming will involve simulated cases of interactions between systems and platforms from other infrastructure providers. It also states that the platform will be tested against MarkitServ’s new credit platform “TradeServ.”The DTCC’s press release also sheds some light on the parties involved and indicates that the project is comprised of a consortium of IBM, Axoni, and R3. The consortium has reportedly “recorded the functionality” of the warehouse through DLT and cloud-based platforms over the last 18 months.Having been involved in the implementation of the technology in food supply chains and agriculture, and working to unify several blockchains via the hyperledger, IBM is already an established blockchain player. The tech giant is reportedly playing an important role in the project, providing “program management, DLT expertise, and integration services.”Axoni is also involved in a blockchain start-up. In August, it raised $32 million in a series B funding round led by Goldman Sachs and Nyca Partners, with high-profile investors such as Wells Fargo, JPMorgan, Citigroup, and Andreessen Horowitz. This latest round of investment brings Axoni’s total financing to $55 million at press time and is illustrative of the new institutional investment in both blockchain and the cryptocurrency sectors.Greg Schvey, one of Axoni’s co-founders, elaborated on how the funding is more than just an important financial shot in the arm, but also indicative of a “deep strategic” alliance with many of the world’s major financial institutions who are actively implementing and innovating DLT themselves. As per the press release, Axoni is providing the digital ledger infrastructure and smart contract applications constructed on the Axway protocol.R3 is an enterprise software firm comprising of over 200 members. The firm focuses on distributed database technology. The prime focus of the consortium is to develop Corda, an open-source platform designed to operate complex transactions and restrict access to transaction data in finance. The firm is acting as the solution advisor for the project.The DTCC has been working on how to implement DLT for several years and, consequently,  the origins of this particular DLT project are found in early 2016. As previously reported by Cointelegraph, the DTCC launched a proof-of-concept along with several high-profile financial institutions such as JPMorgan and Bank of America to demonstrate that complex post-trade events could effectively be managed via DLT in a peer-to-peer network.The DTCC published a press release documenting the timeline of the project in 2018.Most recently, a 19-week study led by the DTCC in collaboration with both Accenture and R3, reportedly found that DLT is scalable enough to support the high daily trade volumes of the U.S. equity market. The report claims that DLT is able to process an entire trading day’s volume at peak rates which can amount to 115,000,000 daily trades, equating to roughly 6,300 trades per second for five hours on end.During the study, Accenture worked on the construction of a network of more than 170 nodes in order to create a realistic model of the chaotic environment of exchanges, broker-dealers, and market participants. The model then captured matched equities trades from exchange DLT nodes. Throughout the project, the DTCC acted as the central counterparty (CCP) to ensure that anonymity was upheld on the ledger.Managing director and chief technology architect at the DTCC, Rob Palatnick, provided an update regarding the progression of the DLT replatforming:“We finished coding the TIW. We’re just working through the typical defect list and trying to start user acceptance testing this fall.”Palatnick also commented on other aspects of the trial that the DTCC is tackling, such as the transferral of completed contracts:“I think there is roughly 15 to 20 million of them. A lot of them are old contracts, so they do not necessarily abide by smart contract validation rules. Figuring out the right way to get them into the ledger and have them there on day one has been one of our more interesting works in progress.”Palatnick also noted how the TIW required more than populating distributed ledgers:“Generally, distributed ledger technology is not a reporting technology. Reporting and analytics are not easy on most DLT core platforms, so you need some kind of accommodation to support that.”The DTCC also published information about the ongoing work to transform its TIW via DLT technology, such as blockchain:“Currently, public blockchains supporting crypto-currencies operate at single or double digit per second performance, which until now was the only indication of the potential volume that a private DLT might be able to support.“To make sure that we really demonstrated robustness and completeness, we wanted a target high enough to measure the performance and allow it to maintain that for a continuous period of time.”With regard to the issue of scalability, Jennifer Peve, managing director of business development and fintech strategy at the DTCC outlined to Forbes that the project required venturing into uncharted territory:“The reality is that for the private distributed ledger, there wasn’t a known performance or scalability figure, all we had to go on was public blockchains for Bitcoin performance, and that is not an apple to apple comparison. Private blockchains are fit for purpose for our industry. They have very different architecture, different privacy and sharing models, data storage, smart contract functionality, and governance model. There are a number of factors that go into performance and scalability of a distributed ledger.""Peve went on to state that the increased scalability rate was beyond initial expectations and helped build confidence in DLT.Murray Pozmanter, head of clearing agency services at the DTCC was also bullish on DLT and the potential benefits for the infrastructure that it could bring:“We are excited to lead this important work to advance the performance capabilities of DLT and help create new possibilities for leveraging the technology more broadly across financial markets. As an early adopter of DLT, we are encouraged by the results of the study because they prove that the technology’s performance can scale to meet the needs of markets of different sizes and maturity.”In spite of an outpouring of positivity from all parties involved in the platform upgrade and the DLT tests, it’s important to note that the DTCC said the study only tested basic functionality. The infrastructure giant also added that future testing must be carried out in order to establish whether DLT is able to meet all security and operational requirements as well as comply with necessary regulatory requirements.On Oct. 16, a report compiled by consulting and technology services provider Capgemini, along with the French bank BNP Paribas, purportedly revealed findings showing that DLT is not yet able to meet financial market demands. The report was compiled using multiple criteria such as industry governance, infrastructure and demographics and made use of interview material with company executives.The report shows that 85.9 percent of participants felt that a lack of interoperability was a significant barrier to progress, whereas 83.1 percent voiced concern over the muddled regulatory environment, one of the most consistent stumbling blocks for both blockchain and crypto projects irrespective of size or financial backing. A further 77.8 percent cited scalability as an issue. More than 60 percent of participants said that security, cost, and time-efficiency constituted problems.A problem highlighted in the report is the uncertain and inconsistent state of regulation in most countries. There is no existing uniform legal framework for regulating DLT and, consequently, the report highlights this as a major impediment to any future development.The October report is not the first time that DLT projects have faced opposition. In March, Reuters reported on how, in spite of bullish advocacy, the DTCC had not done much with blockchain technology.The article reveals that a previous DLT-based project initiated by the DTCC was not carried out in its entirety. An attempt to transfer a system for clearing and settlement of repurchase agreement transactions was shelved after its initially successful testing due to the fact that the trial showed current technology could achieve the same results more affordably. The trial was subsequently described as “a solution in search of a problem” by the DTCC’s head of clearing agency service, Murray Pozmanter.Tim Swanson, founder of technology advisory Post Oak Labs, commented on how the DTCC’s ill-fated project was part of a series of hotly-touted proofs-of-concepts that failed to deliver the goods:“A large part of the problem has been expectation management, or rather lack thereof by many vendors and large consultancies that made claims that could not be fulfilled in the time spans they had said on stage at fintech events.”In spite of this setback, the next phase of DTCC’s TIW replatforming is expected to be rolled out in Q1 2019. Currently, the Australia Securities Exchange is the sole stock exchange to have shifted its market infrastructure to blockchain. Alongside the recent institutional investment trend for Bitcoin and trials being carried out by major financial financial institutions to implement blockchain, the results of the transformation of “Wall Street’s bookkeeper” will be closely watched. If all obstacles are overcome and the project is indeed capable of processing the enormous daily volume of the U.S. equities market, then it could well become the litmus test for other ambitious projects seeking to push for further adoption by the financial mainstream."

""blockchain technology"" coupled with disinterest in ""Bitcoin the 
currency"" ...","Oct 19, 2018","Stablecoins have been making the headlines in recent months, attracting big investors, tempted by the allure of a on ‘non-volatile’ cryptocurrency. At first, we usually pay attention to the backing connection, in other words, to the coin’s  stabilizing mechanism. Broadly speaking, this is broken down into 3 categories: asset-backed (including fiat), crypto-backed, and non-backed stablecoins (including algorithms and the Seigniorage shares’ approach).","This is a great way of introducing the concept of stablecoins and a good basis for providing an overview, but it doesn’t paint a full picture in terms of how the composition of stablecoins can ultimately affect its utility and usability. To do this, we need to include 3 additional, but equally important, aspects into stablecoin discussions, i.e. pegging, collateralization, and redeemability.These 3 aspects provide a more rounded explanation of how stablecoins work, how they are constructed, and how their utility and usability ultimately depend on it.Pegging is commonly associated with the world of foreign exchange, where the currency of one country is fixed or “pegged” to that of a country with a more stable economy. The main goal of currency pegs is to bring stability to more volatile economies, but it’s also a beneficial mechanism for trading partners to make exports more competitive while keeping import costs down.Currency pegs stem from the Gold Standard that originated in early 18th century England, and the Bretton Woods agreement that was implemented after World War 2. Under this agreement, most Western European countries fixed (or pegged) their currencies to that of the United States, who in turn pegged the US Dollar to gold. Although the agreement was finally dissolved in 1973, it was very effective in the post-war era to stabilize economies and promote growth.With cryptocurrencies today, we see the idea of stablecoins, such as USDVault, TrueUSD, Tether, Circle, Gemini, and Paxos Standard pegging 1:1 to a steady fiat currency like the US Dollar.But the phenomenon is also still present in a traditional economy. Many countries use pegging to fix their currency, most commonly to either the USD or EUR. Very rarely though is it 1:1. Examples include the Hong Kong Dollar, pegged to the USD at a rate of 7.75 to 7.85, and the Danish Krone pegged to the EUR at 7.46.  There are different types of pegging mechanisms and not all pegs are a 100% fixed.A crawling peg is a fixed exchange rate but one that is allowed to fluctuate between the par value of the pegged currency and a range of predetermined rates. The par value may be periodically adjusted to account for inflation and other market conditions to increase stability. This allows an exchange rate to adjust over a period of time instead of a sudden currency devaluation.A commonly referenced example, refers to Mexico, which implemented a crawling peg against the USD in the 1990’s. This allowed it to gradually devalue its currency (hence the term crawl) over time, until it reached an acceptable exchange rate, thereby avoiding economic instability associated with dramatic currency devaluations.An adjustable peg is also a fixed exchange rate, but one that that has a predetermined level of flexibility built into it (normally between one and two percent). If the rate moves beyond this range, the central bank will intervene to bring the rate back to the target peg. The goal is to allow a country to stay competitive in the export market.Many developing Asian nations have been known to operate such an exchange rate regime in the past, including Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and South Korea, to restrict the degree of fluctuation towards the dollar and to allow for cheap exports.With a basket peg, a currency will be pegged to more than one currency in a weighted mechanism, comprising currencies of its most important trading partners. The reason a country might use a basket peg is the same reason an investor would diversify their portfolio; to make the currency even more stable and hedge against the risks a single pegged currency might face when the anchor currency suddenly devalues, such as high inflation.Examples here include the Chinese RMB, which is pegged against a basket of 24 different currencies, and the Fijian Dollar, which is pegged against five different currencies.A currency can also be pegged to a reliable commodity, such as gold. For many years, before WW2 and the Bretton Woods agreement, the Gold Standard was widely used to stabilize currencies. However, governments and economists believe the practice can actually stifle growth. Although central banks might still hold some gold as a form of backing, the last currency to decouple from gold was the Swiss Franc in early 2000.Many cryptocurrencies have been designed with a Gold Standard style mechanism in mind, where one token would be backed by a specific quantity in gold, such as Digix and OneGram for example. That has mixed results, because for investors, prices of commodities are not a relevant unit of account. It doesn’t necessarily have to be gold. Venezuela launched the Petro, an oil-backed cryptocurrency pegged to the price of barrels of Venezuelan crude oil.Collateral is defined as “To offer an asset as a surety that a debt will be repaid.” Basically, it’s the asset that the borrower leverages to secure a loan from the lender. The most common example we’ll all be familiar with is mortgages, where the bank customer is able to obtain a loan to buy a house based on the provision that the bank may repossess the house if the customer defaults on their repayments. The house serves as backing or security on the loan and reduces the lender’s risk.The same principle can be applied to car financing, buying jewelry, or art. Businesses can also leverage their existing equipment to obtain financing. With stablecoins, the collateral refers to the commodity or fiat (i.e. USD, EUR). For every fiat collateralized token a platform issues, they should hold an equal amount of fiat currency as collateral, but this is not always the case, as we’ll see later. The same goes for commodity-backed assets, for every token a gold backed stablecoin platform issues, they should hold an equal value of physical gold as collateral, but, again, this does not always happen.When a currency is backed by another commodity or asset, it does not necessarily mean the holder of the currency has that surety to exchange it, or have a claim on, the backed commodity. If we look at the Venezuelan Petro, example above, a holder of Petro tokens cannot exchange it for a physical barrel of crude oil. However, it does mean that physical barrels of crude oil are held in reserves to stabilize the cryptocurrency and to give it a fixed exchange rate.It’s the same principle with gold-backed currencies, where physical gold might be held in reserves to back the currency and to stabilize it, but holders of the currency do not necessarily have a claim on the physical gold, only that they can redeem their currency at a fixed exchange rate against the gold.Collateralization is different though. As Investopedia states it, “Collateralization occurs when a borrower pledges an asset as recourse to the lender in the event that the borrower defaults on the initial loan.” That means in the case of collateralized cryptocurrencies, the holder of such a coin has an actual claim on the collateral, i.e. they can exchange it directly for its value in gold, USD, or even other cryptocurrencies.Most asset-backed stablecoins will claim to be fully backed by the underlying asset. However, understandably, these claims are subject to be scrutinized unless backed up by unbiased, 3rd party auditing entities. One of the most famous stablecoins, Tether (USDT), has been under fire for months since they parted ways with their auditor and have not been able to provide conclusive evidence that they hold 1:1 US dollars in reserve for every USDT that they issue and therefore might be severely under-collateralized.Other stablecoins like Saga, are actually backed by a fractional reserve (i.e. they don’t hold the entire backed asset in physical reserves) and pegged to the International Monetary Fund's SDR (Special Drawing Rights), an international reserve asset.On the other hand, a gold-backed stablecoin such as USDVault, is fully collateralized, meaning physical gold reserves to back issued tokens are held in vaults, which are transparently audited to make sure the stated value of gold actually exists, and a hedge mechanism is in place to maintain 1:1 USD price stability.It is also possible for stablecoins to be over-collateralized. This is often the case when the actual collateral is another cryptocurrency, like with BitShares (BitUSD, BitCNY) and MakerDAO (DAI).The issue with crypto-backed stablecoins is that the underlying asset can be just as volatile as the actual coin. So to counter that, the stablecoin will be over-collateralized, sometimes as much as 200%, so that when the backing cryptocurrency falls 25%, 50% or even 75%, there is still more than 100% of the value left to keep the price of the stablecoin from fluctuating. The important thing to determine is that, whether we are talking about the backing of a stablecoin or securing a loan, is the underlying asset adequate and reliable enough to achieve its purpose, i.e. to act as a security or to maintain stability?Redeemability is closely related to our previous discussion on backing and collateralization. When a stablecoin is backed by a certain asset, it does not necessarily mean that the holder can redeem their token in exchange for that underlying asset.If we look at Tether as an example, it’s backed 1:1 by USD, but is not directly redeemable for USD. On the other hand, TrueUSD, a stablecoin designed on the same basis, i.e. backed 1:1 by the US dollar, is in fact, redeemable 1:1 with the US dollar.In more traditional financial markets, the question of redemption is very valid in bankruptcy law, and dictates certain conditions that have to be met before an individual can actually redeem their claim on an asset, for said asset. Basically, unless explicitly and unambiguously stated, when a currency is backed by an asset, the user should not assume that they automatically have a legal claim on that asset.There are various benefits for asset redeemable stablecoins. One being that it serves as a confirmation in itself that the underlying collateral actually exists, that it’s not a baseless claim. It also provides practical use cases to users, such as, in the case of gold-backed stable coins, not having to convert to fiat for redemption and therefore avoid exposure to currency fees and price fluctuations.As the market matures, stablecoins are becoming a more prevalent presence in the cryptocurrency space. New investors are continually looking to get into the crypto market, but at low risk and high security, while seasoned investors are looking for options to stabilize their portfolios and a safe haven in case of severe market downturns.This continued search is sure to bring up some interesting mixing and matching of pegs and backings. Who says you can’t have a stable coin backed by Ether and pegged to the Japanese Yen? Ethereum Founder and cryptocurrency influencer, Vitalik Buterin, had the following to say on the need for effective stablecoins:“Are stable-value assets necessary? Given the high level of interest in ""blockchain technology"" coupled with disinterest in ""Bitcoin the currency"" that we see among so many in the mainstream world, perhaps the time is ripe for stable-currency or multi-currency systems to take over.”"

Kim spoke at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Banks’ Annual Meeting in Bali, Indonesia Oct. 11.","Kim addressed the importance of fighting poverty while boosting prosperity, pointing out that “there are innovations in the technological world that can help us leapfrog generations of bad practice, generations that would take forever in terms of reducing corruption.” Kim said:“We talked about cryptocurrencies, but we think distributed ledger has huge potential and we issued the first blockchain bond in August, where we created, allocated, transferred and managed the entire bond through blockchain technology.”Kim further noted that the deployment of blockchain helped the group reduce paperwork and costs, adding that it is “something that can be extremely helpful” in the future. He admitted, however, that the bank has not been keeping up with all the latest developments, particularly in a way that would help their customers take advantage of the “great things that are coming out.”According to Kim, the World Bank’s goal is to develop universal access to financial services by 2020 which, in his opinion, will not happen without deeper engagement with the technology world.As previously reported, the World Bank and the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) issued a public bond exclusively on a blockchain. The $73.16 million deal entails two-year bonds that reportedly settled Aug. 28 and have been priced to yield a 2.251 percent return.Following the positive results of the blockchain-platform, Arunma Oteh, a treasurer at the World Bank, stated that the bank “will continue to seek ways to leverage emerging technologies to make capital markets more secure and efficient.”Notably, the World Bank President has previously expressed criticism towards digital currencies. Speaking with CNBC in October last year, Kim shared his bullish views about blockchain technology, while noting the risks of blockchain derivatives like Bitcoin. He stated then:""Blockchain technology is something that everyone is excited about, but we have to remember that Bitcoin is one of the very few instances [of blockchain’s use in currency]. And the other times when blockchain was used they were basically Ponzi schemes, so it’s very important that if we go forward with it, we're sure that it’s not going to be used to exploit.”"

The impetus for its formation this April was in fact sparked by the industry aftershocks of the high-profile Coincheck incident.In the wake of January’s hack, Coincheck received a business improvement order from Japan’s financial watchdog, the Financial Services Agency (FSA),  Mar. 8.The watchdog demanded “drastic” reforms to the exchange’s management system, enhanced AML and counter-terrorism financing (CFT) measures, and revised assessment criteria for the risks for each crypto offering.In April, Coincheck was acquired by Japanese internet broker Monex Group Inc. as part of a major rehaul of its shareholder composition and management.Monex’s fiscal results published late Oct. revealed that Coincheck had seen a 66 percent decline in revenue for Q3 2018. FNNews cites Monex as today saying that it has “made clear” its “commitment to normalization.”On Oct. 30, Monex announced it had reopened new account signups and limited trading on Coincheck, beginning with purchases and deposits of Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum Classic (ETC), Litecoin (LTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH).In the 24 hours since Coincheck’s announcement, NEM has soared a strong 6.18 percent, and is trading at $0.11 to press time, according to CoinMarketCap."

The problem is, too often people fall into the fallacy of thinking that technologies alone can transform how people think and go about their lives, without actively addressing fundamental issues that comes with advanced technology:World leaders are starting to embrace blockchain as a cross-protocols solution that shares decentralized database between very different services, tracks and encrypts data securely, provides seamless transactions, and offers credible transparency for public services.UAE is now pushing to turn Dubai into the first blockchain city by 2020. UAE authorities plan to create a paperless digital government, removing the paperwork burden on both citizens and government officers.However, most blockchain platforms also come with their own set of limitations:Clearly, blockchain by itself doesn’t produce magic. The following requirements are identified for it to reach widespread adoption:Dubai ranks first in the world when it comes to sheer number and size of blockchain platforms being adopted into real life usage. Among projects ambitious to lead the transformative movement is Relam Investment’s project HetaChain.Mr Sultan Ali Rashed Lootah - Chairnman & CEO of HetaChainFounded by Sultan Ali Rashed Lootah, former CEO of the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Foundation, Relam Investment is headquartered in Dubai – UAE; with other group offices located in India, Vietnam, Egypt, Turkey & United Kingdom. Sultan Ali Lootah was the main person responsible for the 2005 upgrading of Dubai Department of Economic Development’s IT infrastructure.In September 2018, Relam Investment officially launched HetaChain and its ICO, aiming to become the technology backbone of smart economy systems around the world. Started in Dubai, the project will proceed to London and Turkey throughout 2018.Designed to be a universal blockchain platform for diverse industries adaptation, HetaChain is a DPoS + BFT hybrid network focused on addressing the blockchain scalability problem, so as to enable cross-industry scale transactions. The project strives to provide solutions to help tech services break down the adoption wall between them and the public:HetaChain uses blockchain’s decentralized and encrypted properties as a way to store, save, and optimize resources. It acts as hub for connecting companies with modern data technologies and in-depth insights that helps to significantly shorten decision-making time.True to the vision of the project, HetaChain does not develop its system alone. It is working very closely with founding members like Mr. Ali Juma AlAjme – Director of UAE’s Ministry of Health & Prevention’s IT Department, as well as technical partners and advisors like MLG Blockchain solutions and Stallion.ai to deploy its Mainnet and other applied blockchain platform functions.Business model is the core of HetaChain’s strength. Since launching, the project has focused much of its efforts into expanding its ecosystem, so as to ensure and increase market liquidity for HetaCoin. Thanks to partnerships with leaders in financial investment and public management services, Hetachain is able to provide entrepreneurs and organizations instant connection with business founders and investors in a wide variety of markets through its smart economy platform:“In my understanding, Kerala can take pole position in Global Blockchain Environment and both Michael and Sultan has agreed to work very closely in helping us being at the forefront of this innovation. I will actively take this topic in Legislative Assembly as well as in other forums to ensure that we develop a landmark policy for Blockchain Technology […] It will also provide new markets for our farmers and help us develop into a Global Hub for Innovation.”- Mr. Parambil on his official Facebook pageThanks to the financial strength and experience of Relam, and the support of high-profile partners around the world, HetaChain is able to systematically achieve its roadmap goals much more reliably than pure tech projects that are trying to mobilize capital through ICO campaigns.As a result, HetaChain's ICO goal is mainly to expand and diversify its network of users, thereby increasing the scopes and possible markets of its partner projects within its smart economy ecosystem. Currently HetaChain is preparing to launch its Public ICO campaign from 11/11/2018 through the end of 10/02/2019.

The bank purportedly froze the accounts due to an inability to identify the funds’ owners.CIBC subsequently requested the court to withhold the disputed funds and decide whether they belong to QuadrigaCX, Costodian, or the 388 users who had deposited the funds. In response, QuadrigaCX told the court that the bank froze the funds mistakenly and claimed to be the undisputed owner of the greater part of the funds.In the recent court file, Judge Glenn Hainey of the Ontario Superior Court ruled in favor of the bank, agreeing that the owner of the funds is not clearly established. Per the ruling, CIBC now has to pass the funds over to the Accountant of the Superior Court, so the court can identify the owner of the money.Regarding the legitimacy of CIBC’s actions in freezing the accounts, Judge Hainey concluded that he is “not in a position on this record to make any determination as to CIBC’s possible liability for doing so,” adding:“Accordingly, it would be inappropriate for me to extinguish any liability that CIBC may have for freezing the accounts in the absence of an evidentiary record that establishes that CIBC has no liability.”Gerald Cotten, chief executive at QuadrigaCX, told the Globe and Mail that “more importantly, the court has made no ruling yet on whether CIBC acted appropriately in freezing the funds in the first place. Regarding this point, we are considering our next steps.”Today, Cointelegraph reported that lawyers representing payment startup Ripple in its ongoing securities lawsuit are trying to move the case to a U.S. federal court. Court records confirm the application to move the case from the state to federal level, which would allow Ripple to prove definitively that its XRP token is not a security under U.S. law, should it win.The lawsuit against Ripple Labs was originally filed in May by law firm Taylor-Copeland for the sale of unregistered securities. The claimants all lost money from purchasing XRP at high prices earlier this year, but opted to sue to include all possible parties affected since 2013."

According to a study published this summer, around 5 percent of all XMR in circulation has been mined surreptitiously through cryptojacking, a figure that was noted to likely be “too low.”Hankyoreh similarly reports that the case is the first in the country to have drawn the attention of the police authorities. The newspaper notes that some of the emails masking the malware resembled real resumes, resulting in the infection of computers used by human resources (HR) staff, adding that the hackers targeted 32,435 people in total. A police official told Hani that:""Security firms quickly responded to the spread of malware, and [the hackers’] revenue was not very high. Most of the cases were detected by anti-virus software within 3 ~ 7 days. When it was detected, the hackers sent further malware, but it was soon detected again.”In a global context, the South Korean case is dwarfed by other cryptojacking campaigns; in July, 20 suspects were arrested in China in a major case that allegedly affected over one million computers and generated 15 million yuan (around $2.2 million) in illicit profits."

Bei der Berechnung des Risikogewichts der Vermögenswerte muss eine Bank jedoch von einem Wert von rund 50.000 US-Dollar für jede Bitcoin-Einheit in ihren Büchern ausgehen. Das bedeutet, dass sie einen größeren Teil des Kapitals als Sicherheit beiseite legen muss, um potenzielle Verluste von Kryptowährungspositionen abdecken zu können.Wie Swissinfo schreibt, liegt ein Risikogewicht von 800 Prozent am oberen Ende des Bereichs für Finanzanlagen, was darauf hindeute, dass die FINMA die Anlage als sehr volatil einschätze. Der Handel mit Krypto-Assets würde von der FINMA ähnlich bewertet wie die Aktivität von Hedge-Fonds, trotz des sehr starken Wertverlustes im bisherigen Jahresverlauf von 2018.Die FINMA setze zusäzlich auch eine Obergrenze für den Krypto-Handel von 4% des Gesamtkapitals nach Verrechnung aller Long- und Short-Positionen. Die Regulierungsbehörde bestehe darauf, dass die Institute melden, wenn sie diese Grenze erreicht haben.Kryptowährungen dürften außerdem nicht als hochliquide Finanzwerte eingestuft werden, die von Banken zur Kompensierung kurzfristig entstehender Verluste genutzt werden könnten.Diese von der FINMA offenbar an die Banken kommunizierten Standards beim Umgang mit Kryptowährungen sollen laut Swissinfo mindestens bis zum nächsten Treffen des Basler Ausschusses für Bankenaufsicht am 26. Und 27. November gelten. Einer aktualisierten Entscheidung des Ausschusses könnte sich die FINMA anschließen. Bis dahin wolle die Regulierungsbehörde bezüglich Kryptowährungen kein offizielles Statement abgeben.Anfang Oktober hatte die FINMA die erste Lizenz für die Verwaltung von Krypto-Anlagen an das Unternehmen Crypto Fund vergeben.

This format is especially useful when it comes to remittances, where many foreign workers face astronomical charges while sending money back to their loved ones thousands of miles away, the company adds.In an aim to be transparent, Uphold has outlined very clearly what its pricing model is. Small fees are applied when an account is funded using a debit card or a credit card, if a member converts funds to a different currency, or if they want to move funds off its platform altogether.Uphold’s range of fiat currencies is extensive, delivering international appeal. Its platform can support conversions with 23 fiat currencies. It also supports eight cryptocurrencies and four commodities, meaning you can leap from New Zealand dollars, to Litecoin, to gold with “exceptional ease.” When compared with other platforms, the company says it helps users to trade across more than 1,000 trading pairs more seamlessly – giving them the freedom to remain in control of their money.This “inclusive and global” approach seems to have paid dividends for the company, as it now has “nearly one million members from over 174 countries.” According to Uphold’s website, the brand is now powering more than $4 billion in digital money transactions – a sign of the progress and growth that the brand has experienced since it was launched back in 2013.In order to shield its users from massive fluctuations in a cryptocurrency’s value, the platform also offers volatility protection. This means they can automatically receive funds in their preferred fiat wallet without having to worry about making about making swift conversions, and prevent the value from changing as the currency is being converted.Uphold has placed an emphasis on enabling users to see how the service is handling their money. As well as providing details about the encryption and auditing measures it undertakes, they publish a transparency page detailing its current transaction volume in real-time, the number of transactions it is handling, its obligations, and the number of assets in reserve. These are divided into three tiers: currencies available for bank transfers; currencies available for holding, exchanging or sending to anyone in the world, and the cryptocurrencies which can be sent or received.As well as wooing individuals, Uphold has been working to attract businesses big and small who are looking for a safe and easy way to receive instant, secure international payments. Just like it has been trying to reduce fees for those sending remittances across borders, the platform is offering ways for companies to transfer funds to international suppliers and members of staff without delays and prohibitive fees. This could also benefit a business’ prospective customers, who are presented with greater payment options at a lower additional cost.Disclaimer.

Security Solutions",https://cointelegraph.com/news/ibms-blockchain-patents-from-food-tracking-and-shipping-to-iot-and-security-solutions,"... a staggering number for in a space that has only been in existence for 
nine years since the inception of Bitcoin. While other tech giants like ...","Oct 15, 2018","The adoption of blockchain technology is slowly taking shape across a multitude of industries. At the forefront of the amalgamation of payment systems and logistics is US tech giant International Business Machines Corporation (IBM), which has established itself as a leader in terms of blockchain-based products and offerings.","The latest developments aim at the logistics sector – but IBM has been keen on blockchain for over 5 years that reveals a slow and steady approach to the adoption of enterprise-scale blockchain solutions.Their beginnings in the space were focused on research on the capabilities of blockchain. Back in 2014, IBM began a study into the Internet of Things (IoT) which led to a collaboration with Samsung in an effort to overhaul early developments with the IoT. The tech giants agreed to develop the ADEPT project, which stands for Autonomous Decentralized Peer-to-Peer Telemetry.In essence, the ADEPT Proof-of-Concept explored the possibilities of appliances interacting autonomously with its environment. This was proved by a Samsung washer reordering detergent and service parts as well as calibrating its own power usage.The project identified three crucial functions of a decentralized system for the IoT – peer-to-peer messaging, distributed file sharing and autonomous device coordination.The ADEPT PoC used Telehash for messaging, BitTorrent for file sharing and the Ethereum blockchain to coordinate more complex functions requiring contract capabilities. This early PoC provided a powerful insight into the capabilities of IoT and was a major milestone for both IBM and Samsung.With the apparent success of the project and the realisation of the applications of blockchain, IBM announced that it would invest $3 billion in March 2015 into a new business unit that would solely focus on IoT.With working experience using blockchain technology in their IoT project, IBM quickly went to work on creating a blockchain solution aimed at large-scale enterprises.The realisation of usable blockchain-based applications came to the fore from 2015 onwards. Rumours that IBM was developing its own blockchain-based payment system were eventually confirmed, although it was initially dubbed an experimental project by senior vice president of IBM Research Arvind Krishna.At the time, Krishna said the company was intrigued by the promise of the technology:“Blockchain, as a technology, is extremely interesting and intriguing. I want to extend banking to the 3.2 billion people who are going to come into the middle class over the next 15 years. So I need a much lower cost of keeping a ledger. Blockchain offers some intriguing possibilities there.”The project uses smart contracts to log transactions between different parties to facilitate large transactions across the world. Funds held in escrow are then transferred once contractual obligations have been met.This payment system eventually became part and parcel of its main blockchain platform, which was launched in April 2015. The IBM Blockchain platform allows the operation of blockchain networks on the IBM cloud. The service was touted to meet exceptional security standards including Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS 140-2) and Evaluation Assurance Levels (EAL).The IBM Blockchain platform is fully functional today, utilising the Linux Foundation’s Hyperledger Fabric which IBM contributed to creating.As part of its global offerings, IBM also provides a means for businesses to access finance through its IBM Global Financing platform, mainly for IT hardware, software and services.As IBM’s focus on blockchain grew, there was a realisation that the the technology could fast-track their financing process in a massive way, especially when it comes to dispute resolution.Jerry Cuomo, IBM’s vice president of Blockchain Technologies, told Cointelegraph in August 2016 that the project could help ease the time taken to resolve thousands of disputes every year.“The fact that in any given year we see about 25,000 disputes within the lending network and this ties up cash, in some cases it can be significant cash, $100 million at any given time which could be held up in disputes. It should be made more efficient so a dispute did not take 40 days on average to resolve.”The proof-of-concept for the project allowed two years worth of transactions on their lending network to be processed in under 10 days.With its own blockchain platform fully operational, IBM has been able to provide a wide variety of industries with a blockchain-based solution for their specific needs. This in turn has led to a number of noteworthy partnerships around the world.In June 2016 IBM agreed to work with a Finnish development agency to implement a smart contract application that would track and provide data on shipping containers.The three year pilot project began in September 2016, aiming to reduce cargo transit times Baltic states of Finland, Sweden, Estonia and Latvia, and is still ongoing.IBM also opened an Innovation Centre in Singapore in July 2016 to help drive the development of blockchain-based applications in the city. The collaboration with the private sector and government agencies promised to deliver a number of pilot projects for trade, finance and logistics industries.As part of its dealings in Singapore, the company announced a partnership with a local startup that would develop Know Your Customer (KYC) projects using blockchain technology in November 2016.Another major reason for setting up a base of operations in Singapore is the proximity of the Port of Singapore Authority (PSA) Terminal, which is the world’s biggest container transhipment port. In August 2017, IBM signed a deal with PSA International to test a new blockchain-based supply chain network.IBM partnered with with Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi in September 2016 to explore the possibility of using blockchain-based smart contracts between its business partners. The aim was to automate transactions using the Hyperledger project.A month later, a $200 million investment into China’s UnionPay Bank’s IoT project also made headlines, as IBM extended its support of blockchain-based developments into the Far East.Blockchain technology is making waves in the logistics and supply chain industries and IBM’s enterprise solutions have attracted some global industry leaders in this particular space.Firstly, IBM and American retail giant Walmart announced they were working together in October 2016. The retailer was looking to develop a blockchain platform that would allow it to drastically expedite the tracking of any products in its stores, from origin to shipment as well as the current status of the product.At the time, Walmart’s IT department had to manually search through its database, which could take days to address complaints or issues with products which had been purchased by consumers.The project was gradually developed and in December 2016, Walmart began a trial to track the distribution of goods in China with the help of the Tsinghua University.The number of partners grew to incorporate Unilever and Nestle by August 2017, as IBM laid the foundation for its food-tracking blockchain platform. The Food Trust blockchain was formally announced in June 2018, as Walmart and IBM continued their collaboration with a number of other enterprises to begin tracking food supply within their supply chains.At the same time, Walmart implemented a blockchain-based platform that its suppliers of leafy greens must use to track produce from farms to its stores in September 2018. These suppliers will have a year to implement the software, which uses IBM’s blockchain service. The technology has allowed the company to trace the source of goods in seconds, where conventional methods would have several days.Frank Yiannas, Walmart's vice president of food safety, told Cointelegraph that decentralised systems would benefit all parties involved in their use:“We never had the intention of creating a product, all this started with the notion that we want to create a transparent food system. The way forward is decentralised as opposed to a supplier getting into a centralised database and putting data in there and the central authority owning the data. In this blockchain ecosystem, if you get into it and give data, it is your data, you own it.“No single entity, nor IBM as the tech service provider can monetise or benefit from that data alone.”While IBM’s solution is the backbone of Walmart’s blockchain system, Yiannas made it clear that they were moving towards a more decentralised network:“A very important concept is self-governance. We have an advisory committee made of participants in the system right now that are setting up the rules on how it operates. We have permissioning of data, and then in terms of the nodes themselves, this is a work in progress.“The nodes are within the IBM solution, but there is already work underway to create nodes that are independent of IBM. We’re in the early days of this, those nodes will be decentralised and they won’t be all IBM nodes.”While all of this was going on, IBM was also busy working on a collaboration with global freight company Maersk to launch a blockchain project to overhaul the logistics and shipping industry in March 2017. This came to fruition in January 2018 when the two companies announced that they would be launching a blockchain-based shipping and supply chain management company.Finally IBM and Maersk launch their shipping solution, TradeLens, in August 2018. Upon its launch, 94 organisations and 154 million shipping events had already been recorded on the platform.While most of its work in the blockchain sector has been focused on software, IBM has a long history of manufacturing hardware. With that expertise, they have also dabbled in creating hardware focused on blockchain usability.In July 2017, IBM launched IBM Z, a blockchain-powered mainframe server that was touted to process more than 12 billion encrypted cloud-based or database transactions in a big move for data encryption technology. The server was said to be able to encrypt data 18 times faster than conventional platforms available at the time.Less than a year later, IBM stated in its annual 5 in 5 report that devices known as cryptographic anchors would be commonplace in everyday objects.The company has been developing these devices, which could serve multiple purposes. The most powerful would be a microchip ‘smaller than a grain of salt’ which will be able to monitor, gather, communicate and act on data.IBM’s work with blockchain has also been implemented in various legal spheres around the world.In Switzerland, IBM and blockchain startup Proxeus were able to register a business in the country in record time, proving the capabilities of the technology to overhaul conventional processes in digital workflows in April 2018.During the same month, IBM was also part of a ‘world-first’ as global insurance brokerage and risk management firm Marsh announced a blockchain solution for proof of insurance.The online advertising space is also in state of flux, as the industry looks to cut out fraud and provide more transparency to advertisers on internet platforms. To this end, IBM began working with Salon Media in April 2018 to develop a proof-of-concept for the digital advertising space that will try address advertising fraud in the space.‘The Campaign Reconciliation Project’ is a blockchain-based platform that hopes to remove the need for intermediaries between advertisers, publishers and consumers. The project will use smart contracts to track various details of ad campaigns that will be immutable and transparent.IBM’s global solutions leader of advertising Chad Andrews told about possible impact to the advertising sector:“With a Blockchain backed peer-to-peer network, achieving transparency in the digital advertising supply chain is possible. But, ensuring its success will require the entire industry, including advertisers, ad tech providers, publishers and agencies to coalesce around a shared, auditable version of truth. Such a pact would facilitate a groundbreaking level of transparency across auditing, reconciliation, fraud detection, discrepancy management and payments.”Following that, IBM began working with software developer Mediaocean to launch a blockchain-based tracking system for digital media transactions in June 2018. The project aims to reduce advertising fraud in the sector.The prospective uses of blockchain technology could also benefit the precious metals and jewelry trade. To this end, IBM is once again working with a number of industry players to develop a platform to track and authenticate the origins of diamonds and jewelry.IBM’s work in the space has not gone unnoticed by governmental agencies either. Thus Australia entered into a $740 million deal with the company in July 2018 in exchange for blockchain-based data security services. The main focus of this project will be providing blockchain, automation and AI software to Australian government departments.The company is also working with the Riyadh Municipality in Saudi Arabia to help develop a blockchain strategy that will streamline governmental processes in the area.There are also recent reports of a collaboration between IBM and the Central Bank of Azerbaijan. It is understood that a five-year program has been agreed upon to digitally transform the country’s economy, with a focus on blockchain technology.IBM also released two reports on blockchain towards the end of 2016 that suggested a boom in the amount of banks, financial institutions and business using blockchain in 2017.The reports, labelled “Leading the Pack in Blockchain Banking: Trailblazers Set the Pace” and “Blockchain Rewires Financial Markets: Trailblazers Take the Lead,” suggested that blockchain adoption would be led by a need to incorporate services and platforms into one single channel.As such, it was said that 15% of banks that took part in the study said they would have deployed commercial blockchain solutions during the year.Having embraced and driven blockchain development over the past five years, IBM is laying the foundations to further its efforts in the space. The company’s CEO, Virginia Rometty, announced in May 2018 that IBM planned to create 1800 new jobs in the blockchain, AI and IoT space.To further that cause, IBM moved its Blockchain World Wire (BWW) payment network out of beta testing in September. The project aims to be a rival to Ripple’s international payment solutions, using Stellar’s blockchain to process transactions between banks in near real-time.IBM has also put pressure on the American congress to begin funding blockchain solutions in a series of discussions with MIT and members of congress in September.The company also filed a patent for a blockchain configuration proof-of-work algorithm in April focused on IoT, that would address security concerns in these types of networks.The latest big announcement coming out of IBM is the launch of its very-own food tracking blockchain platform in October. Food Trust underwent 18 months of extensive testing before its launch in collaboration with Nestle SA, Dole Food Co., Driscoll’s Inc., Golden State Foods, Kroger Co., McCormick and Co., McLane Co., Tyson Foods Inc. and UnileverNV.Over the past year and a half, millions of food products have been tracked using the blockchain system.IBM’s work in the blockchain sector was also recognised towards the end of 2017, as a report from market research firm Juniper Research rated the company as the most successful in deploying blockchain solutions. The report was based on a survey that factored in four hundred top-level executives around the world.In September 2018, IBM was ranked second in the world behind Chinese tech giant Alibaba as the company with the most patents filed for blockchain-related projects.According to this report, IBM has created 89 blockchain patents, a staggering number for in a space that has only been in existence for nine years since the inception of Bitcoin.While other tech giants like Microsoft and Amazon are also making moves in the space, IBM has set an impressive pace to catch. All of this bodes well for the adoption and development of blockchain technology in the years to come."

Included in this list of 1,893 individuals are 14 people who have made their fortune from cryptocurrency and blockchain related business ventures.According to the Hurun list, the 14 new names on the list from the blockchain space make the industry the fastest growing in terms of representatives from one specific industry.It is hardly surprising that global crypto mining giant Bitmain and its directors are leading the pack in their industry, given the meteoric rise in value of the Chinese company. Since its inception in 2013, the company has established itself as the biggest manufacturer of cryptocurrency mining equipment in the world.Topping the list of crypto entrepreneurs is Micree Zhan Ketuan, co-founder of Bitmain, with an estimated wealth of 29.5 billion yuan ($4.3 billion). He is the only crypto-billionaire in the top 100 of the Hurun Rich list.Following him is fellow Bitmain cofounder Wu Jihan who is worth 16.5 billion yuan ($2.4 billion), coming in at 204 on the prestigious list. The third Bitmain cofounder Zhaofeng Zhao, as well as Bitmain vice president Yuesheng Ge, and shareholder Yishuo Hu are also featured on the list.The company’s success over the past few years has been astounding, but it has also been met with some trepidation from the wider cryptocurrency community.Bitmain has been hit with criticism for its stranglehold on the Bitcoin mining sphere, as well as its aggressive tactics when it comes to launching new ASIC mining hardware. The likes of Siacoin and Monero have taken active measures to make their mining protocols ASIC-resistant.That hasn’t stopped the company from forging ahead in what has been a highly lucrative enterprise. In the first quarter of 2018, Bitmain reportedly made over $1 billion in profit. In July 2018, the company was officially valued at $12 billion after a series B round of funding.The biggest talking point of 2018 centered around Bitmain were reports in June of a potential launch of an intended initial public offering (IPO) on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange scheduled for September. This mainly came from comments from Wu, who had hinted at the possibility of an IPO. Investment analysts were speculating that the company could raise anywhere between $3 to $18 billion.With plans to launch the IPO in the public sphere, a number of companies, including Softbank, Temasek, Tencent, and DST Global, which were linked to the listing, distanced themselves from the move.Nevertheless, Bitmain filed a draft application for listing on the Hong Kong stock exchange late in September, bringing the IPO one step closer to life.While Bitmain has become a household name in the crypto mining world, the men who founded its competitors Canaan Creative and Ebang International Holdings are also among China’s richest, namely Canaan’s founder Zhang Nangeng and Ebang’s Hu Dong.These companies are also forging ahead with planned IPOs by the end of 2018.The success of Binance, which has become the biggest cryptocurrency exchange by trade volume in the short two years of its existence, has made Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao the third richest from the crypto community with an estimated worth of 15 billion yuan ($2.1 billion).The success of his company is staggering, considering it got off the ground in July 2017, courtesy of an initial coin offering (ICO) which raised $15 million. The platform allows users to trade cryptocurrencies with various altcoins, as well as the platforms native BNB coin.The company has also set up a bank account in Malta, in the hopes of allowing fiat currency deposits, withdrawals, and trading on Binance in the future.CZ is followed by fellow crypto exchange founders Xu Mingxing ($1.4 billion), who started OKCoin and Li Lin ($1 billion), the man responsible for the launch of Huobi.Renowned Bitcoin investor Li Xiaolai also features on the list with an estimated personal wealth of 7 billion yuan ($1 billion).The entrepreneur may have made a fortune investing in blockchain-based projects and ICOs, but he has now distanced himself from the industry.At the beginning of October, Li announced that he would no longer be investing in blockchain projects for the foreseeable future. A major reason for his decision is the countless number of projects that have claimed to have his support as an advisor or investor.Over the past two years, we have seen a number of the greatest minds from the blockchain and crypto world ranking among the elite in the business, technology, and financial world.Forbes, which is renowned for its annual rich list, has even put together a crypto-focused list of the most wealthy in the industry.Furthermore, Fortune’s 40 under 40 features four of the brightest minds in crypto, who have had major influences in the development of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. Following in the footsteps of Forbes, Fortune also has its own 40 under 40 in crypto.The Hurun List, featuring a number of people from the blockchain and crypto space, is the latest vindication of the impact the sector is having around the world.China’s rich list requires individuals to have a net worth of at least $290 million, which sets a substantial entry point for individuals to make the list.Considering the short amount of time since the inception of Bitcoin and the constant development of new technology in the space, the achievements made by people in the crypto sphere and their recognition among global leaders across industries bodes well for the future of crypto.As Anthony Pompliano suggested in his Off The Chain newsletter, innovators in the blockchain and crypto space could feature more prominently in these lists, as was the case around the time of the commercialisation of the internet:“The richest people in the world today built their fortunes on the back of the internet. It wouldn’t surprise me if the richest people of tomorrow build their fortunes on the back of crypto. The reward for creating value in a decentralized, global world is bigger, faster, and comes with more responsibility than ever before.”"

Issuers of coins would have to comply with certain laws, register with the SEC, and disclose specific information like a description of the organization’s properties or financial statements.When asked whether blockchain technology should be regulated, Gensler asserted that “we should be technology-neutral.” He continued, stressing the necessity to ensure investor protection within certain blockchain applications, such as cryptocurrencies. Gensler said:“I think that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) need more protection, and probably more protection than even the oil markets.”Speaking about future developments in blockchain regulation, Gensler said that there should be some sort of oversight — “traffic lights and speed limits” — to ensure confidence on “crypto roads.” Gensler said he thinks that the two will coexist, but “it will take a number of years to sort it through and get the balance right.”Gensler’s words echo a statement from SEC Senior Advisor for Digital Assets and Innovation, Valerie A. Szczepanik, who said that “if you want [the crypto] industry to flourish, protection of investors should be at the forefront.”Speaking at a U.S. SEC and CFTC senate hearing in February, SEC chairman Jay Clayton said that while every ICO token the SEC has seen so far is a security, a distinction should be made between tokens and major digital currencies such as BTC and Ethereum. The definition of ETH as a security has reportedly been questionable.In December last year, Clayton issued a public statement, concluding that most tokens sold in ICOs are likely securities under U.S. law. Clayton then noted that the content of the transaction is more important than the form in determining if an investment is a security."

According to the company’s press release, all cryptocurrency and fiat withdrawals are and have been processing as usual without the slightest interference.","After some mild clarifications, tension is rising in the crypto community – the spread between Bitcoin prices on Bitfinex and other exchanges, on October 15, reached $1,000 against the massive sale of Tether (USDT). In the meantime, Bitfinex is testing its improved solutions, it remains to be seen about the possible consequences for the crypto industry and to be confirmed that this is not a repetition of the story with Mt.Gox, which some traders draw a parallel to, but simply the implementation of a “new and increasingly robust fiat deposit system”.The transparency of the work on one of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges has been questioned as early as October 2. The reason for this was the financial problems of the Puerto Rico’s Noble Bank, which was allegedly engaged in servicing the operations of Bitfinex and Tether Ltd (Bitfinex owners are the beneficiaries of Tether). As reported, the bank has filed for bankruptcy and is now searching for a buyer.The news about the financial problems of Noble Bank was first published on Sept. 30, 2018. The information came from an insider, who reported on the possibility of a quick liquidation of the bank if it wouldn’t receive support from the holders of large amounts of Tether. The non-publicized connection of the bank with Bitfinex accounts were revealed by the BitMEX exchange researchers.The cryptocurrency trading platform has dismissed that notion, stating in a Medium post that “stories and allegations currently circulating, mentioning an entity called Noble Bank, have no impact on [their] operations, survivability, or solvency.”A day before the above post, Larry Cermak, a chief analyst at The Block, tweeted that Bitfinex had engaged HSBC as its new banking partner:Bitfinex is now banking with HSBC through a private account of Global Trading Solutions. Very good fit if you ask me. It's also worth mentioning that all EUR, JPY and GBP deposits are paused but Bitfinex ""expects the situation to normalize within a week"". Banking issues? pic.twitter.com/1pxQ13NO0mBitfinex has faced challenges with banks before. Thus, on April 18, 2017, the exchange suspended fiat withdrawals and reported that several Taiwanese banks, with which it cooperated, had repeatedly blocked its transactions.A cryptocurrency fund manager, Jacob Eliosoff, suggested that those withdrawal issues could create new pressures within the industry of digital money:“This is a dynamic many of us remember from the Mt. Gox days when there were problems with fiat withdrawals. Investors responded by converting fiat they had on the exchange to Bitcoin so they could withdraw it. They buy Bitcoin to withdraw, pushing up the price on the exchange.”A little earlier, in the second half of March, U.S. bank Wells Fargo & Co. suspended its services related to processing Bitfinex’s transactions. On April 5, the latter filed a lawsuit against the bank which was quickly dropped.On Medium, a user called Proof of Research, wrote a detailed article titled “Bitfinex is No Longer Solvent – Remove Your Money Now” where he highlighted the difficulties in withdrawal issues that many users of the exchange have been facing.The article is no longer available publicly, since the user’s account is now suspended. The blogger pointed out complaints, posted on Reddit, by users who were censored by Bitfinex moderators. Additionally, throughout the previous week, there were a series of complaints about poor customer service and the inability of stopping the infinite loop of currencies being loaned out on the platform. All of these reasons could have accelerated rumors that Bitfinex has become insolvent.The concerns over Tether are not new. Bitfinex has been accused, by numerous media and industry representatives, of not being transparent on the audit of Tether, raising a lot of concerns over the 1:1 peg of the stablecoin. Notably, the crypto market is dependent on Tether currency, which is the eighth largest cryptocurrency, with a market cap of $2.2 billion. Furthermore, there are many crypto exchanges like OKEx, which are dependent on this cryptocurrency, as Tether is the second most traded crypto coin.Last time Tether and Bitfinex proved the existence of real fiat money behind their tokens, after the community had repeatedly expressed scepticism with regard to banking audits and the source of funds. On June 20, Tether’s general counsel, Stuart Hoegner, stated that the number of USDT issued was equal to $2.54 billion, which almost coincided with the numbers reported by Coinmarketcap.However, this week marked a sharp fall for the USDT price. During the Asian trading session on October 15, before the opening of trading in Europe, Bitcoin unexpectedly rose in price.Image source: TradingViewOn Bitfinex, its exchange rate jumped by 21.9 percent to $7,788. The spread between Bitmex and Bitfinex reached $970.It was suggested, by some users of the Bitcoin community in Reddit, that the price of Bitcoin on Bitfinex was caused by the massive sales of Tether. On exchanges such as Bitfinex, Bitmex, Binance, where the USDT was trading, the highest volatility of the coin was observed.As of October 20, the market situation gradually beginning to stabilize. On Bitfinex, the price dropped from $7,788 to $6,535 (-16 percent), on Bitmex - from $6,818 to $6,385 (-6.3 percent).On October 7, Bitfinex denied all of these allegations in a blog post, stating:“Bitfinex is not insolvent, and a constant stream of Medium articles claiming otherwise is not going to change this.”To further back its statements, the exchange representatives referred to the links leading to their key cold wallets where the main reserves are stored:Firstly, Bitfinex revealed that it held BTC valued at over $1 billion, ETH valued at over $400 million, and $200 million worth of EOS. The management pointed out that this is just a fraction of what their cold wallets contain.Additionally, Bitfinex stated that these wallets represented only a small part of their holdings, not considering the fiat holdings of any kind. They also clarified that all deposits and withdrawals were functioning normally, although “problems in fiat transactions exist, as they do for most crypto organizations.”In an updated press release on Oct. 15, 2018, Bitfinex has clarified the following:The exchange, with this short and informal announcement, took into consideration the concerns this event has caused to the cryptocurrency industry, and promised to implement a new and increasingly robust fiat deposit system to be available in the next 24 hours. And though it has kept its word, according to a press release posted on October 16, amid upgrading their order system, other questions have arisen.Today we are happy to announce the release of the Honey Framework, beginning with an Algorithmic Order Library for creating custom, complex order types on Bitfinex.https://t.co/fWCvQnGKNXOver the last few weeks you guys have almost done everything possible to create this FUD yourself-from deleting user questions on Reddit, to running away & hiding. Why aren't you allowing an independent audit? Why is your CEO not visible anywhere like Binance's or Coinbase's?At the same time, unconfirmed news and rumors claiming that Binance may delist USDT in the near future have spurred across Telegram groups and sent by email.FAKE: Saw this floating around and it's an obvious fake. Binance is VERY politically correct and will never write ""Tether big scam"" (it doesn't even make grammatical sense). This is just as bad as the ""Vitalik is dead"" scam last year. @cz_binance @binance pic.twitter.com/bd9AnvclmtIn a tweet, Changpeng Zhao, Binance’s CEO has commented “too much FUD” regarding this situation. Two days earlier, CZ argued about USDT’s stability, while some of his followers question why CZ is risking his reputation to support Tether:Regulated stable coin, lol pic.twitter.com/5SRMhhh32YAlex Kruger, a cryptocurrency trader and analyst, stated that the USDT price fall could be caused by three factors:Traders opting for audited and regulated alternatives like Gemini USD and Pax;Traders selling USDT to purchase other cryptocurrencies;Concerns about banking services used by Tether LLC.Despite the trend of the market stabilization, it remains only to assume whether the Bitcoin price surge on Bitfinex was caused by a massive sale of USDT or more serious factors. Some analysts don’t exclude the speculative origin of Tether's volatility caused by fake messages in various Telegram channels and forums about the possible delisting of USDT by KuCoin and Binance.Bitfinex resumed accepting fiat deposits and upgraded its security system. The representatives pointed out that “all cryptocurrency and fiat withdrawals are, and have been, processing as usual without the slightest interference.” Nevertheless, some users still feel the fear of losing their funds due to the inappropriate functioning of the exchange’s services and other users’ complaints. According to one of them, Bitfinex tech support specialists attributed delays in processing transactions to the change of a banking partner of their payment processor.However, any possible changes in banking partners relationships won’t affect security of users’ funds, Bitfinex communications director Kasper Rasmussen  assured. He also added that the exchange is “currently working [its] way through a backlog of fiat withdrawals and a few users unfortunately continue to experience these delays.”How quickly these problems will be solved is still unclear, but the number of users’ complaints and tickets, which can be tracked here, show that this is not a matter of “a few” accounts.

Transactions are verified by thousands upon thousands of independent ...","Nov 7, 2018","Multinational auditing and consulting firm, Ernst & Young (EY), announced on October 30 the launch of their EY Ops Chain Public Edition (PE) prototype, the world's first implementation of zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) technology on the public Ethereum blockchain.","This system aims to overcome three main barriers of current transactions and asset transfers on a public blockchain:Although still only a prototype version, and set for live production offering in 2019, this technology could prove hugely significant.To consider this in greater detail it’s useful to first look at the difference between public and private blockchains and what zero-knowledge proofs are exactly.The biggest difference between public and private blockchains lies in who is allowed to join and participate in the network.Public blockchains are open to everyone and anyone can, theoretically, join the network, download the protocol, and read and write transactions on its decentralized network. The most well-known public blockchains are Bitcoin and Ethereum. Transactions are verified by thousands upon thousands of independent computers around the world, or nodes, to maintain an ecosystem of trustless consensus. The more decentralized the network is, the more secure and resilient it becomes.However, this security comes at a cost. Each transaction has to be confirmed by every node and to reach consensus, nodes have to perform resource-intensive calculations to solve complicated cryptographic equations, also known as proof-of-work. This decreases transaction times and increases transaction costs, significantly reducing reliability during times of high network activity.As a result, scalability has long been recognized as one of the biggest barriers to widespread enterprise adoption of public blockchains.Another problem of public blockchains is privacy. Transactions on a public network can’t initially be linked to the person behind them but transaction information, such as amount, date, sender and receiver address is publically available for anyone who has access to the network. Pseudonymous addresses can be tracked and followed until the user transacts over a centralized cryptocurrency exchange, at which point their real identity is compromised.Private blockchains, on the other hand, are only open to parties who have been invited to join the closed network. They are also referred to as permissioned blockchains because to become a network participant, the user will have to be granted permission by the network starter through a set of rules or conditions.A fully private blockchain is where write permissions are usually controlled by one organization, while private blockchains can also take the form of a consortium, where consensus is reached through a group of pre-selected nodes.Private and consortium blockchain networks are well-suited to enterprise adoption, especially in the finance industry, because transactions are private and only visible to the limited amount of network participants.Examples of private and consortium blockchain networks include Hyperledger, private blockchain infrastructure, and R3, a global banking and financial institution blockchain consortium based on their distributed ledger technology product, Corda.Once again, this privacy of private blockchains comes at a cost. The network is less decentralized and therefore less secure and less resilient to attacks.Zero-knowledge proofs have been defined in a 1988 published paper by researchers from MIT and the University of Toronto as “those proofs that convey no additional knowledge other than the correctness of the proposition in questions.”In cryptography and the blockchain world, ZKP is known as a method that allows one party to prove to another party that a statement is true without giving up any additional information. There are three aspects to ZKPs:ZKPs allow for greater privacy on public blockchains by enabling nodes, or network participants, to verify the existence and validity of transactions, and therefore maintain distributed consensus, without actually being able to see or make public any of the transaction details, guaranteeing privacy.This is why the EY Ops Chain PE prototype is so significant. Public blockchains typically offer better security and liquidity through greater decentralization, while private blockchains offer complete protection of customer information.The EY solution, through the usage of ZKPs, allows the company to harnesses the security and resilience of a public blockchain, such as Ethereum, keeping the consensus algorithm intact, maintaining complete privacy over transaction information and, therefore, leveraging the benefits of both worlds.According to Paul Brody, EY Global Innovation Leader, Blockchain, this is exactly the desired outcome.""EY Ops chain PE is a first-of-its-kind application and a major step forward that empowers blockchain adoption. Private blockchains give enterprises transaction privacy, but at the expense of reduced security and resiliency. With zero-knowledge proofs, organizations can transact on the same network as their competition in complete privacy and without giving up the security of the public Ethereum blockchain.""Moreover it could fuel growth in enterprise blockchain adoption by “greatly reducing the expensive and time-consuming process of setting up private networks and on-boarding business partners one at a time.""James Wester, research director of Worldwide Blockchain Strategies at International Data Corporation (IDC), a global provider of market intelligence and advisory services, agrees that the application of ZKP’s to public blockchains will encourage growth and enterprise adoption.""The development of tools that enhance the capabilities of public blockchains will spur enterprise adoption of public blockchains and are crucial to the growth of blockchain technologies in general. The ability to ensure privacy while retaining the security and resilience of public blockchains is an important consideration. It offers an opportunity for enterprises to begin building real-world solutions on public blockchains and is an important step in the evolution of the technology.""Ethereum has long been looking at using a version of the ZKP protocol, called Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge (ZK-SNARK), pioneered by ZCash, as part of the Byzantium upgrade which, in turn, is part of the Metropolis hard fork.Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, also more recently stated in an ETH Research post that the network could potentially scale to 500 transactions per second by using ZK-SNARK to mass-validate transactions.However, he admitted that ZK-SNARK transactions on the Ethereum blockchain would be very expensive and computationally intensive, perhaps insinuating that it’s not quite ready yet for mainstream enterprise adoption.“FWIW [For what it is worth] I do agree this whole thing is expensive in terms of prover time, though given that I expect the relayers will be GPU farms so it’s less of an issue than it is in, say, Zcash where regular nodes need to be able to make proofs in a few seconds.”Another issue of ZK-SNARK transactions on the Ethereum blockchain, according to a white paper released by members of the Blockchain team from multinational Dutch bank, ING,  – who also launched a zero-knowledge tool – is that it is notably less efficient.“ZK-SNARKS are generic; they can verify any function which is particularly relevant for Ethereum which provides the Turing-complete EVM, allowing developers to build any type of logic. Generic ZKPs like ZK-SNARKs, however, come at a price. They are notably less efficient than specific zero-knowledge proofs.”Detailed technical information is still not available on EY’s Ops Chain PE system but the press release specifically stated that the technology will allow companies to privately and securely create and sell product and service tokens on a public blockchain with private access to their transaction records without breaking the consensus algorithm, i.e. Ethereum’s proof of work consensus algorithm remains intact.Were E&Y able to do what Ethereum could not, that is, to come up with a scalable, cost-effective solution to private transactions and asset transfers on a secure and resilient public blockchain? E&Y’s positive comments in their press release about enabling growth in enterprise public blockchain adoption would suggest that they did.A number of questions still remain open: whether E&Y’s ZKP solution is more specific to overcome the barriers of Ethereum’s more generic proposal of using ZK-SNARKS for private transactions, and if so, how would it be different to the ZK-SNARK protocol."

A similar decline in investment has been reported in traditional Venture Capital (VC) funding for blockchain projects.In the report, the decline in funding is accompanied by a median return on investment (ROI) of -22 percent in Q3 2018. As the report states:“The same indicator was +49.32% in the 1st quarter and −55.38% in the 2nd quarter.”Regulation is in part cited as a cause for the downtrend, with the increasing crackdown on this fundraising method by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) putting “hundreds” of projects at risk.In June of this year, the SEC’s chairman stated that while Bitcoin (BTC) is not considered a security, most ICO tokens probably are, requiring their issuers to register with the Commission.During Q3 — from July to September 2018 — ICO funding overall has fallen by 48 percent.

Those projects that disappeared after collecting funds attracted 3 percent of the total ICO funding in Q3, which amounts to about $62.1 million, the report states.The research also covers the stages at which projects tend to start their ICOs: of all the projects included in the study from Q3, 76.15 percent were at the “idea stage” when they ran their ICO – 18.72 percent more than in the previous quarter.When it comes to the choice of the platform for token sales, Ethereum remains king with 83.75 percent of ICOs choosing to release their token on its blockchain.Looking more broadly to the last year, the ICO market has been fluctuating, registering two peaks concerning both the number of projects and amount of capital raised in December 2017 and March 2018.As Cointelegraph previously reported, funds raised by ICOs during October increased 26 percent when compared to September, from $403.1 million to $508.54 million, despite only 54 projects having raised $1 or more."

include Bitcoin, Binance Coin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash.","Nov 7, 2018",A fledgling blockchain-based company which aims to improve flight safety is gearing up to launch an upgraded version of its app for pilots – software that has been designed to replace the old-fashioned paper logbooks currently used by aviation enthusiasts and professionals.,"Aeron estimates that 57 percent of aviation accidents can be attributed to human factors – and poor record keeping is often to blame. The company says it is possible for pilots to manipulate records and exaggerate their experience, while airlines may underreport flight hours to save on maintenance costs.Aeron has been working to implement blockchain into existing aviation safety protocols to stop vital data from being lost, distorted or forged. Over time, it is hoped that this will help to reduce the number of fatal accidents in the world’s skies substantially.In March, Aeron launched the first iteration of its mobile app for pilots on Apple’s App Store and Google Play – enabling them to record their flight hours on blockchain instead of paper and earn the full confidence of prospective employers and aviation authorities. This month, new features are being added so the pilots can create and submit flight plans – detailing the intended route and other flight details, bringing convenience to the pilots of small aircraft and flight school students. In a blog post, Aeron said that this upgrade was in response to suggestions from the community, adding: “Furthermore, statistical summaries will be introduced, offering more insights into the pilot’s experience.”The company has also revealed that it has had “intensive interaction with aviation authorities in various jurisdictions, primarily in the European Union.” It is hoped that a specialist portal where a pilot can submit logs online, with authorized officers viewing and processing records, will be launched in the spring of 2019.Negotiations and deals with authorities are expected to be forged in 2019 as Aeron pursues business development in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.  Aeron’s token, ARN, took off on Nov. 1, 2017 – and since then, the company says its currency has been flying high. On the anniversary of its launch, the company revealed that ARN had achieved a global monthly volume ranking of 39, based on CoinMarketCap stats.This, in part, is because of its utility as a payment method in the Pilot Shop powered by Aeron, where customers can buy branded accessories and aviation supplies. It is expected that fresh merchandise is going to be added to the platform later this year – and other payment methods in the online shop include Bitcoin, Binance Coin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash.Aerotrips.com, which is the name of its subsidiary website, is also a marketplace for reserving private flight experiences, with Aeron describing the platform as “an online portal and aggregator for aviation that gives special attention to private flights and individual pilots.”The company is also widening its scope further and aims to offer benefits “to anyone who flies, including passengers of commercial airlines.” Aeron introduced a new platform called CryptoBonusMiles (CBM), which will enable frequent flyers to collect bonus miles in a single unified wallet and receive crypto rewards whenever they hop on a plane, in addition to the perks they receive from conventional loyalty programs offered by major airlines.Ahead of the release of an alpha version of the CryptoBonusMiles platform, Aeron has announced an airdrop of CBM for current holders of Aeron (ARN) tokens.Disclaimer.

The EquiTokens infrastructure is reportedly based on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain, which is widely used by decentralized applications (DApps) developers.According to Verdict, EQUI Global will target “sophisticated” investors that are focused on venture capital funds through investing in EquiToken. The model intends to facilitate the trading experience by allowing for the easy liquidation of tokens through cryptocurrency exchanges. The report further notes that 80 percent of EQUI Global’s investments will be put in technology companies, while the rest will be invested in other fields like real estate and art.As Wozniak stated, the company’s mission is to “seek, support and fund the blockchain and tech stars of tomorrow.” Wozniak noted that the company has already partnered with “over 20 businesses” that have not been launched officially.Wozniak also emphasized that his participation in EQUI Global is “about the second time in twenty years” when he has agreed to be involved in a project, while he has been receiving “dozens” business offers and ideas “every single day.”According to EQUI Global’s website, the company was set up “nearly a year ago” from press time, while the idea of EQUI’s model has changed since the initial launch. Originally, the founders were considering launching the company as an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) that used the EquiToken as a means to raise capital on a project-by-project basis.By co-founding a firm supports blockchain and crypto technology, Wozniak has appeared to change his sceptical stance to the field, following his recent statement that blockchain is a “bubble” similar to that of dotcom era, as he claimed in June 2018. However, earlier in June, Wozniak also spoke positively about Bitcoin (BTC), arguing that “only Bitcoin is pure digital gold.”"

The plaintiffs state that the token was actively endorsed in social media both by celebrities and experts to create an impression of  “a valuable liquid investment.”However, the group continues, T.I. and Felton defrauded them by using the money raised to drive the token’s price up, and when the prices fell down, they dumped the FLiK and disappeared. According to the lawsuit, Felton even created a new company, stating it had acquired FLiK and telling investors he had nothing to do with it.Now the plaintiffs want to obtain a minimum of $5 million in damages from T.I. and Felton. The lawyer for the celebrity did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the matter to The Blast.The FLiK was announced back in September 2017 and also actively supported by U.S. actor Kevin Hart, who promoted the coin on his Twitter. As U.S. tabloid TMZ reports, the promo campaign also mentioned Mark Cuban — a billionaire and owner of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks. According to the stats provided by CoinMarketCap, the coin was traded at its peak on Oct. 17, 2017, when its price reached 21 cents. Seeing a brief takeoff in February, it slowly declined to nothing, traded at $0.001 as of press time.Celebrities have often become involved in crypto-related activities from time to time, but their attempts and promotions do not always succeed. For instance, another U.S. rapper Ghostface Killah — a member of renowned Wu Tang Clan — co-founded an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) that hoped to raise up to $30 million. However, his Cream Capital was later suspended “with no plans to hold the token sale in the future.”Floyd Mayweather, one of the world’s famous boxers and the highest paid athlete of his discipline, also engaged in an ICO, dubbing himself as Floyd “Crypto” Mayweather. Later in 2018, one of the coins he backed, Centra, was charged with fraud by U.S. securities watchdog SEC.Another celebrity to recently join a crypto startup was Johnny Depp, who partnered with crypto-powered social entertainment platform TaTaTu. Cointelegraph reported in mid-October that the American movie star is going to team up with the TaTaTu founder in order to jointly create and produce film and digital content."

As of August, GTE cited him on its website as endorsing the project:“I am really excited to be involved with Global Tech. Their ambition and drive is something that I resonated with straight away and I can’t wait to learn more about blockchain technologies.”Clarke later posted the quotation to his Twitter account and was immediately warned by his followers about the general controversy surrounding ICOs.The reasons behind the ICO’s closure remain unclear – ASIC has not yet commented on the matter following Business Insider’s request. On paper, the move appears instigated by GTE itself, which evidently voluntarily applied to the ASIC to deregister its ICO.As per GTE’s website, the company has already returned all funds to investors. The statement also explicitly noted that Michael Clarke is “no longer associated with Global Tech Exchange and the Global Tech Exchange Blockchain education and awareness program.”GTE’s ICO marks the sixth crypto crowdfunding project to be closed in Australia since April 2018. As Cointelegraph reported in September, ASIC revealed that the five other ICOs shut down before April were stopped due to a lack of required investor protection measures on part of the fundraisers in question.However, only one of them was shut down permanently, while others needed to be restructured, the regulator noted.This fall, ASIC has also revealed its plans to increase scrutiny of cryptocurrency exchanges and ICOs to ensure any “threats of harm” from the nascent industry are mitigated under its regulatory scope."

Why IBM's Blockchain Isn't a Real Blockchain.","Oct 19, 2018","The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has adopted changes to its standards regarding digital currencies and firms involved into cryptocurrency-related activities, according to an announcement published Oct. 19.","Paris-based FATF, also known as Groupe d'action financière (GAFI), is an intergovernmental organization established in 1989 on the initiative of the G7 to set standards and promote effective implementation of legal, regulatory and operational measures to fight money laundering. The FATF has since developed a series of Recommendations recognized as the international standard for combating money laundering (ML) and the financing of illicit activities.In 2015, the FATF introduced guidance on a risk-based approach to digital currencies, calling all countries to take coordinated action in preventing the use of virtual currencies for crime and terrorism financing (TF).Now, the organization has determined that the Recommendations require revision as governments and the private sector have sought clarification on exactly which activities the FATF standards apply to.Per the changes, jurisdictions should ensure that virtual asset service providers — exchanges, wallet providers, and providers of financial services for Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) — are subject to anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing (CFT) regulations.According to the FATF, such entities should be registered or licensed and monitored for due diligence compliance, record-keeping, and reporting of suspicious transactions.The FATF also noted that it will provide clarification in ML and TF risks related to virtual currencies, and at the same time develop a regulatory environment where companies are free to innovate. The statement further reads:“As part of a staged approach, the FATF will prepare updated guidance on a risk-based approach to regulating virtual asset service providers, including their supervision and monitoring; and guidance for operational and law enforcement authorities on identifying and investigating illicit activity involving virtual assets.”Last month, the FATF’s president Marshall Billingslea said that current AML standards and regimes for cryptocurrencies are “very much a patchwork quilt or spotty process,” which is “creating significant vulnerabilities for both national and international financial systems”. However, he pointed out that despite the risks related to these assets, digital currency as an asset class present “a great opportunity.”In June, the FATF announced its efforts to develop binding rules for crypto exchanges, which would also be an upgrade to the non-binding resolutions which were adopted by the FATF in June 2015. Apart from AML measures and reporting suspicious trading operations, the agency will also investigate how to work with countries who have moved to ban cryptocurrencies."

U.S. ...","Nov 7, 2018","U.S. software company Salesforce has won a patent to detect spam emails using blockchain technology. The patent filing was published on the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) website Tuesday, Nov. 4.","Salesforce, which offer its customers is a cloud-based mailing platform, patented a solution that allows for the detection of whether an initial email was modified while being sent. In addition, the blockchain-driven program could help improve the existing filters that often fail to distinguish between spam and regular emails, such as promo letters.As explained in the technical part of the document, to assure the authenticity of the message, the first email message server will record a selected component of the current message into a block to get other nodes’ approval. When the second server receives the message, it checks the blockchain record to find out whether the data has been replaced. If the two messages match, the email is marked as wanted. If the content has been altered,  the mail goes to the spam folder.Although the patent specifically addresses the mailing platform solution, Salesforce notes that blockchain can also solve issues with the authenticity of medical records, educational transcripts, deeds, property rights, and legal documents.As Cointelegraph previously wrote, email management platform Credo is also trying to tackle spam using blockchain. A 10 percent share of the project that plans to use tokens to verify letters was acquired by Bitcoin investor Tim Draper back in 2017.Other U.S. companies have been actively filing patents for various blockchain solutions. International Business Machines Corporation, or IBM, is ranked as one of the biggest providers of blockchain-related patent technologies. IBM has filed a total of 89 blockchain patent by Aug. 31, beaten only by Chinese giant Alibaba with 90 patent applications.The most recent patent that IBM has filed is set to maintain safe boundaries between augmented reality (AR) objects in video games and real-world physical locations. According to the document, a blockchain-powered location database would allow mobile devices to obtain a signal about whether a certain location on AR is undesirable."

blockchain will correspond to a deposit or withdrawal of funds from the ...","Oct 24, 2018","Tether, issuer of stablecoin USDT, says it has “redeemed a significant amount” of tokens from the circulating supply and will now “destroy” 500 million USDT from the Tether treasury wallet, in an official post published Oct. 24.","According to the firm, this will leave 446 million USDT remaining in its treasury in preparation for future USDT issuances — meaning that those tokens redeemed and “burned” account for 52.8 percent of the total former supply.The redemption is visible on the OMNI blockchain explorer, which shows a confirmed transaction dated today of 500 million USDT in block 547155. Tether’s announcement directs the public to consult the “conceptual” outlines of the token issuance and redemption process as described in its white paper, where the firm states that:“every tether issued or redeemed, as publicly recorded by the Bitcoin blockchain will correspond to a deposit or withdrawal of funds from the [company’s] bank account.”As the white paper notes, for the crypto side of its accounting processes, the public and transparent nature of the public Bitcoin (BTC) blockchain — onto which tethers are issued via Omni Layer’s protocol — ensures that the token transaction can be verified and tracked.Omni Explorer further indicates that Tether’s token reserves are now 466,678,763.48, congruous with the company’s statement.When it comes to its fiat accounting, the white paper states that, as part of “the ‘Solvency Equation’ for the Tether System […] the provability of [U.S. dollar reserves] will rely on several processes,” including the firm’s publication of bank account balances on its Transparency page (“Proof of Funds”), and professional audits.Tether has a notably contentious history in regard to its transparency conduct, as crypto investor and entrepreneur Michael Novogratz recently underlined. Casting doubt on the firm’s claims that USDT is backed one-to-one by the U.S. dollar, some have gone so far as to accuse the firm of covering up an alleged fiat reserve deficit in complicity with Bitfinex.After the firm is alleged to have dissolved its relationship with a third-party auditor this January, its “Proof of Funds” released in June claimed that Tether did have sufficient dollar reserves for circulating tokens, held in an undisclosed bank.Today’s large-scale token redemption and destruction has provoked heated speculation on crypto Twitter, notably as tether had just recently — if briefly — lost its U.S. dollar peg to trade as low as $0.91, leading some to accuse the firm of manipulating the market by redeeming at low cost and liquidating after the market rebound.Crypto personality WhalePanda quipped in this vein, “$USDT scarcity incoming! $1.01 soon.”Others have suggested that the company is unable to back the tokens with adequate reserves, alluding both to Tether’s troubled transparency history, the protracted crypto bear market, and the fact that associated crypto Bitfinex has recently been plagued by rumored insolvency and alleged banking difficulties, which it has since been prompted to officially deny.Just today, Bitfinex responded to a recent media report that had accused the exchange of publishing trading volume data for “a market that doesn’t exist,” by feeding data regarding a “USDT-USD trading pair” — which is not supported on the platform — from its in-house API to popular crypto data site CoinMarketCap."

crowd ownership of real estate possible. Those who cannot afford to ...","Nov 11, 2018","The real estate industry has seen significant growth since the recession. With market prices predicted to increase along with millennial demand in 2019, the industry is as welcoming as ever. Although the market is improving, it is still plagued by issues that make the investment process less convenient than it should be.","Real estate investment has three major drawbacks: the presence of intermediaries, the lack of affordable funding options, and fraud.  Agents take up to six percent of the total payment made on a real estate asset. This means that intermediary fees would account for over $23,000 for a house that costs $400,000. Unfortunately, up to 80 percent of home buyers still use an intermediary and continue to pay these fees according to a report by the National Association of Realtors.Real estate is also expensive and the prices continue to climb, limiting access for a greater part of the population. According to research by CNBC, an investment of $1 million will most likely buy about 270 square feet of prime property in New York. However, only about 10 percent of US residents can afford such a price tag.Finally, the commercial real estate industry is rife with fraud, not just in the United States, but globally as well. According to a statement by the FBI, the internet crime complaint center saw a 480 percent increase in real estate fraud complaints filed in 2016. These crimes, including title fraud and online sale scams are aided by the rarity of trusted platforms where real estate documents can be verified.A blockchain is an immutable ledger in which transaction data can be recorded. Its benefits include transparency, traceability, accessibility, and enhanced security. When implemented in the real estate industry, these properties can solve its major issues.Blockchain real estate platforms eliminate the need for intermediaries like lawyers and agents by providing a means of property verification and payment to buyers. Paying for property using cryptocurrencies can also help buyers bypass bank fees. It cuts the fees associated with escrow by offering smart contracts that can be customized according to a users’ needs.The tokenized nature of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum makes crowd ownership of real estate possible. Those who cannot afford to purchase the whole property can simply buy a part of it, like buying shares in a company. Such investors would receive transferrable tokens that represent their shares and can be verified easily on a blockchain. This makes real estate investment accessible to more people.Blockchain can also prevent fraud in the industry by providing a way to easily authenticate property documents. As these properties are transferred, their records are added to the blockchain and a comprehensive history is formed. In the event of a sale, buyers can easily check if property is fraudulent.Several companies are working to bring these solutions to the commercial real estate industry. One such company is i-House.com, which implemented a series of ATO (Asset Tokenization Offering) projects in less than a one- year span. These projects allow users to crowdfund real estate development projects using IHT, the company’s cryptocurrency. So far, their reach has extended to the U.S., Japan, Thailand, and the Philippines.The i-House ATO model provides real estate accessibility and a verifiable platform for related transactions. By Implementing such a concept in the industry, the i-House ATO platform is positioned to disrupt it positively. i-House.com Chairman and Founder, Ricky Ng., said:""We aim to create a shared economy asset management ecosystem that spans across the globe, i-House ATO provides real estate owners, developers, and end users the means to own and share assets easily”IHT was recently listed on the Bittrex exchange and South Korea’s largest exchange, UPbit. IHT is currently listed on nine other exchanges including Cashierest, KuCoin, Gate.io, Coinw, LBank, HitBTC, CoinBene, CoinTiger and Allbit. The company stated that it hopes to get listed on more top global exchanges in the future.Blockchain presents an opportunity to change how real estate transactions are handled. Everything from land registry to provenance and payment systems currently have a lot of room for improvement. With better systems in place, there will be more incentive to invest in the industry and further bolster economic growth.As companies like i-House.com make these changes to the industry, the real question lies in how quickly others will follow suit. Will this be one of those things that don’t become mainstream until there is a crisis in the industry? We may have to sit back and watch.Disclaimer.

The partnership will seek to develop an Indonesian based and regulated blockchain exchange using Kinesis technology.","Together, Kinesis and ABX have developed an evolutionary monetary system using real assets (gold and silver) as the basis for digital currencies. These currencies are transacted on the Kinesis Blockchain Exchange, a fork of the Stellar Network which is able to handle more than 3000 transactions per second. The system is also integrated with mobile banking and fiat currency exchange services.ABX, the world’s leading electronic institutional exchange for physical precious metals, has been working with JFX to expand gold investment opportunities in Indonesia. JFX is a leading exchange for gold futures contracts, and is now launching a spot physical Sharia Gold Contract, in partnership with ABX, having been granted approval by Indonesian regulators and the Indonesian National Shariah Board.  A blockchain exchange version of gold-based currencies, through collaboration with Kinesis and ABX, is a natural extension of the JFX and Indonesian government vision.The expanded partnership between JFX, Kinesis and ABX envisions an Indonesian blockchain exchange based on the technical advances of the Kinesis Blockchain Exchange.This partnership is part of JFX’s future intention to create blockchain-based solutions in addition to existing infrastructure, allowing investors alternatives, in which to benefit from an increased ease, speed and security of transactions. The future development of this partnership propels institutional acceptance of blockchain technology, through the sharing of concepts, business models and technology solutions.Stephanus Paulus Lumintang, President Director, Jakarta Futures Exchange, comments: “JFX is committed to providing the best solutions and services in the futures and derivatives industry. It’s increasingly become clear to us that the benefits of distributed ledge technology, or ‘blockchain’ will unlock tremendous amounts of value for Indonesia and Indonesian people. “Blockchain regulation in Indonesia is currently in progress, and it is quite an important, yet difficult task. However, JFX is ready to be a blockchain exchange company in Indonesia, in compliance with any legal and regulatory requirements.”“Our future partnership with Kinesis and ABX will enable us to not only tap into these advantages but to create a secure and transparent blockchain network that provides a credible alternative to existing systems of exchange.”Thomas Coughlin, CEO Kinesis; CEO ABX, comments: “The bespoke blockchain network that we developed creates a complete monetary system which enables real, physical assets to be transacted and exchanged digitally, at speed and at low cost. We believe that the integration of physical precious metals and distributed ledger technology offers tremendous value to the Indonesian market, with its dual interest in gold and in blockchain. We look forward to continuing our partnership with JFX to bring this to fruition.”Kinesis is a monetary system which is based on the traditionally stable commodities, gold and silver. The Kinesis Monetary System allows participants to mint their precious metals onto the blockchain using a bespoke process developed by Kinesis in partnership with Allocated Bullion Exchange, abx.com. Participants can then spend this physical bullion using the Kinesis debit card and the Kinesis eWallet. This system is made safe and reliable by strategic and technical partnerships with an institutional precious metals exchange and others. The Kinesis Velocity Token is a utility token attached to the success of the Kinesis system, providing participants with a 20% share of all the transaction fees generated proportionate to their holdings of the limited 300k supply. Over 58,000 KVTs have been sold to date and are currently for sale to the public at USD1,000/KVT. KVTs are now in the public sale period, ending in March 2018.

According to BaFin’s announcement friday, the firm must cease trading since its activity is not approved by German financial legislation, including the German Banking Act.In a short description of the company’s activities, the financial regulator noted that Crypto-Capitals offers “options, contracts for difference (CFDs) on shares, indices, currencies and commodities.” In turn, the company positions itself as a “premium cryptocurrency trading platform operator.” The firm also evidently does not possess an account on any of the social networks listed on its website.Previously, BaFin has addressed the cryptocurrency industry with public warnings, particularly focusing on Initial Coin Offering (ICO) projects. In late 2017, Germany’s major financial regulator warned investors about the risks of investing in ICO tokens, claiming that ICO investors take all associated risks upon themselves due to the “lack of legal requirements and transparency rules” in the industry.In February of this year, BaFin clarified obligations for ICO issuers, following “increased queries” about ICO tokens, with operators specifically inquiring “whether the underlying tokens, coins or cryptocurrencies behind so-called ICOs are viewed as financial instruments within the area of securities supervision.”Most recently, last month BaFin urged the global community to combine efforts in order to regulate the ICO industry, despite uncertainty as to whether ICOs will remain a “niche issue,” or become a “standard part of the financial economy.”Prior to that, in June 2018, BaFin’s President stated that the main mission of the agency is not protecting individual retail investors, but rather the preservation of general financial stability."

obviously throughput and latency will be big issues, against what 
expected ...","Oct 10, 2018","Blockchain has one new supporter: the UK finance minister Philip Hammond. Quizzed at the Conservative Party conference on how the UK government might solve Brexit’s UK-Irish border issue, he suggested that blockchain technology may be a solution.","""There is technology becoming available […] I don’t claim to be an expert on it but the most obvious technology is blockchain.”He didn't go into any further detail, but in raising distributed ledger technology (DLT) as one way of facilitating 'frictionless' movement between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, he sparked hope that blockchain could help ensure seamless post-Brexit trade between the UK and the EU, and all without requiring Britain to be part of the European Economic Area or the Customs Union.However, while there is some potential for DLT to be used in a post-Brexit world, there's still a very long way to go before solutions involving blockchain tech could be rolled out at scale. And more fundamentally, even though the best blockchains ensure an immutable ledger of transactions, there would still remain the eternal issue of the initial reliability of any data entered into them.""In my assessment there is zero chance that blockchain technology will help deliver a ‘frictionless’ border between Northern and the Republic of Ireland,"" Vili Lehdonvirta tells Cointelegraph. An associate professor and senior research fellow at the University of Oxford, Lehdonvirta's recent research has focused on the application of blockchain to the wider global economy. And while he's familiar with the promises that have been made on behalf of DLT, he's sceptical as to whether most of these promises will be realized.""Blockchain has become this magical buzzword that people like Philip Hammond who don’t know what they're talking about are pinning all kinds of hopes and dreams on. I think the onus is on the proponents to explain how blockchain tech could possibly help here. For starters, we would need to know what exactly is meant by “blockchain” here. If it means a Bitcoin-style peer-to-peer proof-of-work system, then obviously throughput and latency will be big issues, against what expected benefit?""Indeed, scaling is still currently the nemesis of Bitcoin and other proof-of-work (PoW) blockchains (e.g. Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Monero), and while improvements have been made in recent months, it's still hard to imagine a Bitcoin-style blockchain coping with the immense daily traffic the Irish (and every other EU-UK) border experiences. For instance, an average of around 30,000 people cross the North-South border every day for work, while 35% of Northern Ireland's exports go to the Republic (worth around £4 billion in 2016). This is a hefty amount of traffic, yet peer-to-peer PoW blockchains aren't particularly scalable compared to existing systems: Bitcoin can handle a maximum number of seven transactions per second (compared to Visa's 50,000+), while Ethereum was notoriously backlogged last December in the wake of CryptoKitties' popularity.As for private, or 'permissioned' blockchains (which are centralized), Lehdonvirta doesn't think they hold out much promise either. ""If it means IBM-style permissioned blockchain, then that’s essentially just a shared database, nothing particularly groundbreaking about that.""Not only is this not especially groundbreaking, but there's currently no indication that a private blockchain is noticeably more efficient or effective than a shared database. ""If we’re talking about permissioned blockchains, they have yet to prove that they have any benefits over centralized databases, so I don’t see any benefit there,"" says Angus C. de Crespigny, EY's former leader of blockchain and cryptocurrency.This pessimistic assessment of blockchain's applicability to cross-border trade is shared by other experts. Gary Barnett, Chief Analyst for GlobalData’s Technology Thematic Research Program says:""Blockchain technology is not well suited to the processing of cross border trade. It is expensive, complex, and slow.""As Barnett explains to Cointelegraph, the problem isn't simply one of technological capability, but of relevance:""Blockchain only becomes useful or interesting in domains where no single participant in a network can take the role of transaction coordinator. In [cross-border trade], whether importers like it or not, the border authorities can take on that role and mandate that importers use whatever system they choose.""And more fundamentally, there are deep political tensions which weaken the possibility of blockchain ‘solving’ the Irish border issue. Regardless of how efficient, inexpensive and reliable DLT could be become, Irish people on both sides of the divide are likely to be very unhappy with any kind of customs procedure, after having spent two decades (since the Good Friday Agreement in 1998) getting used to passing freely from one country to the other.Nick Botton, an expert on trade affairs and digital economies at Landmark Public Affairs (and formerly at the European Center for International Political Economy), tells Cointelegraph:""The Northern Ireland issue is sadly not one that will likely ever be solved via technology, it's strictly a political issue at this stage. Even if a blockchain customs border were something that could be developed in the next 5 years, which would be able to handle all customs matters perfectly, a border in either Ireland or between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK would still be impossible to sell to Ireland and Northern Ireland. A border, whether soft or hard, is still a border, which would require policing, so as to prevent fraud and smuggling. Such an arrangement, whether in Ireland or in the sea, would be rejected by both sides of the Irish Island.""A border (hard or soft) would most likely revive the memory of living during the Troubles, which was defined by a period of violence and a military presence along the Irish border. ""It's dangerous on all sorts of terms,"" Dr Katy Hayward said to Business Insider in April.. ""Northern Ireland is a unique situation and its sensitivities need to be respected.""When this issue is widened in scope to include the UK's future trade and relations with the rest of the EU, the prognosis is slightly better, but there are still serious question marks hanging over just what blockchain can offer that existing solutions can't.Digital consultancy group Reply published a report in December called ""Blockchain for Brexit,"" in which it outlined the areas in which DLT could help with post-Brexit UK-EU trade. ""The primary contribution of blockchain here is [to] establish a robust and watertight data trail for goods,"" the report's authors wrote, arguing that such a trail would ""reduce the need for inspections at the border.""However, in its report, Reply notes that several conditions and challenges must be met before such a role for blockchain could be realized:""In other words, to use blockchain properly, it’s not enough to maintain a record of the origin of an item. You have to have a complete record of all transactions involving the item, including inspections. This means adding to the blockchain at every link in the supply chain.""Maintaining a complete record like this could be labor-intensive, especially when it comes to processing goods. ""For example, when a large animal or fish is cut up into pieces, to be sold to multiple consumers. Blockchain can be used to check that the total weight of the pieces is consistent with the original weight of the whole, but again this assumes that all the pieces are tracked.""An even more serious issue revolves around the assumption that the data initially entered into a blockchain is reliable. For example, a blockchain could tell you that an orange has come from, say, Spain, and that it hasn't been tampered with or swapped as it made its way across the supply chain, but it can't guarantee on its own that the person who first registered it on that blockchain was being truthful about its Spanish provenance. It may have actually come from Portugal, which means that we still have to have additional systems in place for determining the trustworthiness of initial records and entries on a distributed ledger.Angus C. de Crespigny concurs:""If we’re looking at public blockchains, a blockchain is only as good as the data you put in it, and to come to an agreement on what data is put in, we need to coordinate people to begin with. Blockchains are regularly sold as ways to coordinate diverse groups of people, however this coordination is a people issue, not a technology issue. Once you can coordinate people, there is almost always a better technology to use than a blockchain.""Irrespective of whether other technologies are better, they already appear to have a head start over blockchain, thereby reducing the likelihood that the UK government will seriously look into implementing DLT. “HMRC [Her Majesty’s Revenue & Customs, the UK’s tax service] is already in the process of rolling out the first phases of a major digitization program (the Customs Declaration Service),” concludes Gary Barnett, underlining the possibility that Philip Hammond’s remarks may be out of step with the rest of his government.“[This] represents a multi-year investment of several million pounds, but which effectively extends the functionality of the already existing digital customs system. This could be adapted to cope with the increased volume of customs declarations […] At this stage, adding blockchain technology to the mix would effectively add to the risk and delay the project.”"

As soon as the legal issues with the Swiss government and the country’s financial market regulator (FINMA) are clarified, the company is going to offer trading in selected stocks, followed by other stocks, bonds, and exchange-traded funds.According to Zeeb, the decision to launch a digital exchange was forced by a rivalry with major crypto exchanges, such as Coinbase or Binance. Zeeb believes that they are “pushing” into the business of traditional exchanges and pose a big threat, adding yet again that the competitors could bypass banks or stock exchanges completely.Switzerland is actively supporting crypto-related initiatives, adjusting its legal framework to industry needs in different areas, including banking.In October, FINMA issued the country’s first cryptocurrency asset management license to a crypto investment fund. The license will allow it to offer a wide spectrum of collective investment products that track Bitcoin (BTC) and other crypto assets. And in November, local startup SEBA Crypto AG, aiming to create a bank offering cryptocurrency-related services, revealed it is expecting to receive a banking license from FINMA in 2019.Prior to that, Singapore Exchange Limited (SGX), along with the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), have successfully tested the use of blockchain for tokenized assets settlement. The trial was conducted in partnership with U.S. stock market Nasdaq and “big four” consulting company Deloitte."

While, according to Quartz’s source, the government is looking to “encourage” blockchain studies, the launch of a state-backed cryptocurrency is only an option to be considered.The source has also said that the panel will discuss new amendments to the existing draft bill on cryptocurrencies. One of the proposals is reportedly to make any possession of cryptocurrency without the government’s approval a punishable crime.The panel was created in December 2017 by India’s Ministry of Finance to discuss crypto regulations in the country, Quartz notes. It is expected to present its report by the end of 2018.The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) first announced its ban on providing banking services to any cryptocurrency users in early April. Within a day, RBI revealed that it was exploring ways to issue its own digital currency. Despite the government’s interest in launching its own crypto, the ban did come into power July 6.The Supreme Court of India has received several petitions against the RBI’s decision, the last of which were set to be examined in late September.Venezuela was the first country in the world to launch a state-backed cryptocurrency. Petro, a digital asset that is reportedly backed by oil, gold, iron and diamonds, was first announced by the country’s president Nicolas Maduro on Dec. 4, 2017.However, a recent report by Reuters claimed that there is no sign of Petro’s existence in Venezuela, while a U.S. culture magazine Wired has called the Venezuelan cryptocurrency ""a stunt.""Iran and China are also considering creating their own state-backed digital currencies. Iranian Minister of Information and Communications Technology presented the idea in February, stating that the country’s ban on crypto dealings would not apply to the government-issued coin.

# ...","Oct 10, 2018","Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) have raised $20 billion since the start of 2017, which is $18 billion more than the previous year, according to a recent study by financial research firm Autonomous Research. The study dubbed “Crypto Utopia” explores the cryptocurrency industry over the past year, focusing on ICOs and the regulation to which they are exposed.","Per the study, $12 billion has been raised through ICOs in the course of 2018, while last year they raised $7 billion. The ICOs of blockchain protocol EOS and messaging app Telegram are responsible for almost half of all ICO funds in 2018 at $4.2 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively.Though over 300 crypto funds have been launched to invest in crypto assets, a vast majority of funds are concentrated within a small minority of organizations, according to Autonomous.  The research notes that ICOs are often exposed to fraud and scams, which form 20 percent of project white papers, while phishing and hacking are responsible for stealing 15 percent of all crypto assets by market capitalization. More than 50 percent of ICOs have failed to raise funds and subsequently have closed.2017 saw over $7 billion of investment flow into ICOs, which is fourfold greater that equity investment in crypto companies. Many ICOs were purportedly launched to take advantage of the “goldrush,” subsequently resulting in quality and regulatory concerns regarding tokens.Price performance for the top 200 liquid coins during the last 1.5 years has reportedly demonstrated an unprecedented surge, from 10 to 1 million percent. The authors of the study suggest that such a performance shows exponential software-like growth for digital currencies.The study states that  venture and trading funds are “the most numerous and hold the most assets under management.”Another study by Autonomous Research published last month stated that funding in ICOs has seen its hardest slump in 16 months, stating that in August startups raised $326 million, which is the smallest amount since May 2017.In August, ICORating published a study showing that the ICO market more than doubled in a year. ICOs in Q1–2 2018 had already raised over $11 billion in investments, a figure which it purports is ten times larger than the sum of investments from ICOs in Q1–2 2017."

in connection with two of his early Bitcoin (BTC)-related ventures.","Nov 16, 2018","Crypto loans company Salt Lending Holdings Inc., once associated with high-profile crypto industry stalwart Erik Voorhees, is facing a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) probe over its 2017 $50 million token sale, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported Nov. 15.","Founded in 2016, Salt — which uses clients’ crypto holdings as collateral against fiat currency loans — is reported to have received a subpoena from the securities regulator this February, according to “sources familiar with the matter.”Among other issues, the SEC is said to be investigating whether Salt’s 2017 token sale was a noncompliant securities offering (i.e. whether it should have been registered with the SEC), how token proceeds were used, and the manner in which Salt employees received tokens.Voorhees, who is well known as CEO of crypto exchange ShapeShift, is reported to have played a “leadership” role at Salt, and was notably listed as a “director” in an SEC filing five days ahead of the first SALT token sale in August 2017.This latter point is now of particular contention, as Voorhees has previously been investigated by the SEC and has effectively been prohibited from raising money in private markets. In 2014, he reached a settlement of $50,000 in fines and disgorgement with the SEC over allegedly unregistered public offerings of securities in connection with two of his early Bitcoin (BTC)-related ventures.Keith Higgins, chairman of the securities and governance practice at Ropes & Gray LLP and a former SEC division director, told the WSJ that:“A provision in the [2014] settlement makes him a so-called ‘bad actor’ unable to rely on an SEC safe harbor for private, unregulated stock sales.”Aside from being listed on Salt’s summer 2017 SEC filing, Voorhees was also named as a Salt director on the company’s site and promotional materials, according to the WSJ’s review. In November 2017, Salt reportedly amended its SEC disclosure, declaring the $1.5 million it had raised, and refraining from any mention of Voorhees.Jennifer Nealson, a Salt executive, has confirmed to the WSJ that the firm received a February subpoena, and clarified that Voorhees was an “early contributor” to Salt, but stated he “no longer serves in any formal capacity.”Securities lawyers have said the SEC could seek civil penalties against the company if it deems that Voorhees’ involvement broke the law.Aside from the probe, Salt is facing a private lawsuit in the U.S. state of Colorado from a former Salt financial officer, who has accused the firm of giving loans on advantageous terms to insiders, and of having lost $4 million worth of crypto in a February 2018 hack. Voorhees has reportedly not been named as a defendant in the case.Brian Klein, the trial attorney who represented Vorhees in his 2014 settlement with the SEC has responded to the WSJ article, tweeting:“I am proud to represent @ErikVoorhees, a real visionary, who has abided by his SEC settlement terms. This @WSJ story is an unfair attack on him relying on unsubstantiated allegations, anonymous sources, and he is not even a party to the lawsuit discussed.”Earlier this fall, Voorhees refuted a WSJ report that alleged that $9 million in ill-gotten funds were laundered through ShapeShift, claiming that the WSJ had misrepresented or omitted the information provided by the exchange."

Wood is quoted as saying that he hopes it “will be a turning point” in the transition to a “multi-chain world.”Fellow conference speaker Trent McConaghy reportedly responded by commenting that Polkadot had made the blockchain tech ecosystem leap forward “between 2 and 3 years.”This summer, Cointelegraph published an interview with Parity CEO and co-founder Dr. Jutta Steiner, in which she outlined the importance of blockchain interoperability in the transition to the web 3.0 era."

Crypto market news service Coinness has claimed this in a tweet Thursday, Oct. 11, citing its private correspondence with TRON’s team.","Neither TRON nor Baidu have been able to confirm the partnership to Cointelegraph as of press time.Without specifying the details of the partnership, Coinness has claimed that the deal between TRON and China’s Internet giant Baidu will be “officially” revealed by the cloud storage service Baidu Cloud “next week.”While Coinness claims that TRON has exclusively confirmed the partnership in private correspondence with it, the crypto platform itself has not yet officially announced any details of the partnership or even the identity of its new business partner.TRON’s CEO Justin Sun has recently hinted on Twitter at a secret partnership with an unnamed “industry giant” that is valued at “tens of billions of dollars.” In his Tweet, posted Friday, Oct. 12, Sun has similarly provided little information:“Finally, First time to partner with tens of billions USD valuation industry giant. Guess the name.”As mentioned on TRON’s website, the decentralized Internet company TRON Foundation was established in Singapore in July 2017, while TRON’s open source protocol was launched in December 2017. The company has dual headquarters in Beijing and San Francisco, and a team of over 100 employees working all over the globe, with some of them being formerly employed by China’s Internet giants such as Alibaba, Tencent and Baidu.In late September, TRON released details about its partnership with a popular torrent client BitTorrent, following the earlier acquisition of the company. A collaboration between the two companies dubbed “Project Atlas” will reportedly enable the users of the BitTorrent client to receive rewards in TRON for seeding torrent files.Earlier in August, Baidu has joined Tencent and Alibaba in enforcing new anti-crypto policies in line with China’s overall toughened stance on the industry. The firm has shut down at least two popular crypto-related forums, with a notice to their users stating that Baidu’s measures are compliant with the “relevant laws, regulations and policies.”On Sept. 26, Baidu has released its Baidu Blockchain White Paper V1.0, aiming to create “the independent development of the ‘Super Chain’ network system.”TRON is currently the eleventh largest cryptocurrency by market cap, according to CoinMarketCap data. On June 25, TRON celebrated its “Independence Day,” when it migrated off the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain to its own independent public blockchain.At press time, TRON is trading at $0.023, up 2.79% on the day.

Pay-to-Play Gaming Is Flawed, Blockchain-Based Platform Says.","Oct 12, 2018","Call it counterintuitive, but blockchain could be considered less transparent now than the stock market. How so? Blockchains are apparently open, and anyone can see which token went where, after all. Well, yes and no. Blockchain is a forest, and a forest is the best place in the world to hide a leaf. We know (or suspect) that many tokens have their prices tweaked. Until now, the industry still lacks an instrument to give a bird’s-eye view of the blockchain.","A startup called Coinscious is quietly building a remedy for this inevitable “teething problem” which all markets have to go through in their early stages. The company aims to offer data services, augmented with an AI-based software suit that comes up with “actionable insights” for crypto-trading. The suite harnesses almost all of the latest technology of the day, except, perhaps, virtual reality – because AI, blockchain, meep machine learning, and big data, are all there.Decisions, both for humans and machines, start with material data. There is plenty of data already about who, when, and for how much a token was sold. But this data might be less meaningful without a wider context, since not all data that influence prices are on the blockchain. Blockchain token movements often correlate and respond to actual events in the real world – corporate announcements, management changes, partnerships, and media coverage.Coinscious goes further than just crunching the numbers on blockchain movements. Their platform crawls social media such as Twitter and news outlets, extracting atoms of token-related “sentiment” from posts and articles. The result is a normalized, systematic array of data about what happened to a token on the blockchain or elsewhere so that the trader may see an analysis of not only what happened, but also, why.The word “analysis” comes from the Greek “dissolving”, “dissecting” the corpus of data to extract meaning from it. Coinscious’s data services allow traders to come up with hypothesis and back-test them – but it still takes a considerable effort to come to a conclusion like “Token A has dropped 30% after the combination of events B,C, and D happened.”In other words, it still takes a human brain to develop a hypothesis. Later in the future, it could be different. Coinscious is developing a machine learning logic that works on top of the data services. The algorithm will gnaw through massive amounts of constantly updated data, learning to discern patterns of “disturbances in the force”. It will detect attempts to artificially pump a coin, and notify the user – so he can piggyback on someone else’s effort to boost their coin. Or alert the community about an attempted fraud.Eventually, as the Coinscious team sees it, a human decision might be required only for the actual trading – the data and insights will flow, already processed, to the desk, so that the trader could wage his or her bets.Say, a trader, aided with AI and machine learning tools, comes up with a strategy “If events A, B, and C all happened to coin Z, buy coin Z because in a week, there is a 95% probability that it will be worth 20% more.”When proven, this trader will be able to program a trading bot with that strategy, and let it loose. Until something changes fundamentally, the winning strategy might keep earning speculative interest for its master.Unlike many emerging blockchain projects, Coinscious doesn’t seem to be overly preoccupied about launching a token and going “public” by means of an ICO. They have a white paper, and imply that at some date in the future, the project may do so, but as of October 2018, Coinscious’ team prefers to get busy on launching a working product first.By the end of this year, Coinscious plans to start selling data products, that include millionth-second level trading history and orderbook data, blockchain and social media updates. Using these, traders will be able to simulate and backtest (i.e. validate) their strategies.They anticipate that access to quality data may enable both existing quantitative trading strategies, and allow crypto-specific trading strategies to emerge. Also, the company's management sees a common benefit for the entire market, emerging from increased transparency.If the project will be fully implemented, products similar to what Coinscious plans to offer, may eventually demonstrate the complete irrelevancy of humans on the crypto- (or any) trading floor. Will humans become redundant in crypto trading? We’ll have to wait and see.As of now, professional data services, like the one that Coinscious plans to offer this year, will certainly curb the rampant insider trading, pump-and-dump schemes, and other “teething problems” our market, yet immature, is going through.Disclaimer.

They are thus more vulnerable to negligence, or even alleged complicity by the gatekeepers of user identity data. He advised investors to use a “Google voice” number, as:“[Y]ou have to have something that does not have a retail store where a $10-an-hour employee can be bribed to give up your information and your digital life.”"

ERC-20 makes the creation of new tokens extremely easy, which is why ETH became popular with crowdfunding companies working on Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs).Per the announcement, Coinbase has launched support for ZRX on its professional platform, Coinbase Pro, although trading will only be allowed once sufficient liquidity is established. The exchange notes that a separate announcement will be made when the token becomes available on coinbase.com and on its iOS and Android apps.ZRX trading will be available in most jurisdictions, except the state of New York during its initial launch stage. Coinbase has divided the launch into four independent stages for each new trading pair; ZRX/USD, ZRX/EUR and ZRX/BTC, while the exchange notes that currently it will not offer trading on the ZRX/GBP pair.As Coinbase states in the blog post, in the first, “transfer-only” stage, customers will be able to transfer ZRX into their Coinbase Pro accounts, without an option to place orders. The second “post-only” stage will let customers post limit orders, however with no matches. The subsequent stages — “limit-only” and “full-trading” — will enable matching limit orders and full trading services, including limit, market, and stop orders respectively.In July, Coinbase announced its was considering adding five new assets — Cardano (ADA), Basic Attention Token (BAT), Stellar Lumens (XLM), Zcash (ZEC), and ZRX — to its trading list. The trading platform noted then that the new assets “will require additional exploratory work,” also warning that the listing process may make some coins available for customers to buy and sell only, without the ability to send or receive them using a local wallet.Coinbase revealed its intention to add support for ERC-20 tokens in March, reversing previous statements from January. “After evaluating factors such as liquidity, price stability, and other market health metrics, we may choose to add any ERC-20 asset added to GDAX to the Coinbase platform,” the platform asserted.At press time, ZRX is trading at around $0.76, up by 5.42 percent on the day, according to CoinMarketCap.

Initially, the company expected its ZXG token to be listed by international exchanges, but then the decision was then cancelled, according to the press release:“We believe that ZXG Crypto fund No 1. will have difficulties to operate smoothly with such current pressure from the financial authorities.”Zeinex and its Chinese partner, Genesis Capital, will return the funds invested in ZXG in Ethereum (ETH) on Monday, Nov. 12.In late October, South Korea’s Financial Services Commission (FSC) warned investors about investing in unauthorized crypto exchanges and Initial Coin Offerings (ICO), as they fail to protect investors from risks according to Korean regulation.As local finance newspaper Business Korea explained, the notification in particular mentioned Zxg Crypto Fund No. 1. The FSC stressed that the company had never been registered by the Financial Supervisory Service as required by South Korea’s Capital Market Act.A Zeniex representative told South Korea’s main daily business newspaper, Maeil Business Newspaper, that the company was not obliged to register as it had raised less than 1 billion won ($884,500) in total. However, the FSC started the investigation against the company, citing a lack of ability to check whether the platform is operating as claimed.Although in early 2018 South Korea was rumored to be about to impose a strong ban on crypto, the country then decided to regulate the area instead. Banning anonymous trading, forbidding minors and government officials from trading, and taxing exchanges substantially were among the measures announced by country’s government to control crypto-related activities. The government has since recently been lobbied by local lawyers to clear up its stance on crypto and elaborate a clear legal framework."

in Europe",https://cointelegraph.com/news/fatf-guidelines-updated-to-combat-money-laundering-and-terrorism-financing-in-europe,"Cointelegraph has reached out to the FATF for comment – and has not 
received a formal reply at the time of publication. #EU · #Bitcoin ...","Nov 10, 2018",Regulation has been a major talking point in the cryptocurrency sphere in 2018 - mainly due to the monumental crypto-craze in 2017.,"This has come to the fore in Europe, after the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) updated its policy on cryptocurrencies in October, which were initially established back in 2015.To understand the implications of these refurbished guidelines, one needs to understand the role of the FATF and its involvement in the regulation of cryptocurrencies.Established in 1989, by the G7, the FATF is responsible for creating legal, regulatory, and operational measures to prevent money laundering in Europe and around the world. Since its inception, the FATF has created a number of recommendations that are regarded as the international standard for fighting money laundering and the financing of criminal activities.A massive surge of investors looking to gain exposure by trading cryptocurrencies on exchanges across the world, has led to governments and financial regulatory bodies having to provide clear legal frameworks and guidelines for those operating in the space.Naturally, this has taken on different shapes and forms in different regions of the globe. We’ve seen hardline, no-to-crypto stances from countries like China, while a nation like Malta has adopted a pro-crypto attitude that could well make it a leading destination for crypto and blockchain-related businesses to thrive.Within that vein, the FATF organisation released a “risk-based-approach” guideline for cryptocurrencies in 2015, which aimed to help countries develop regulatory processes to manage the potential risk of cryptocurrencies being used for money-laundering and terror-financing.As it stands, 35 countries are members of the FATF, many of which are situated as financial centers across the globe.European countries make up a large percentage of the member states, including UK, Turkey, Switzerland, Sweden, Spain, Norway, Netherlands, Luxenbourg, Italy, Ireland, Iceland, Greece, Germany, France, Finland, Denmark, Belgium and Austria.With this in mind, the FATF’s recommendations on the regulation of cryptocurrencies to address AML concerns are specifically important for the continent.As of October 2018, FATF has implemented some changes to its original recommendations three years ago that apply to financial activities relating to cryptocurrencies. This has largely been in response to calls for clarity on which activities the FATF guidelines apply to.In relation to cryptocurrencies, the FATF rules regarding a risk-based response to Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Countering Financing of Terrorism (CFT) have been amended to address concerns around the use of cryptocurrency financial activities.Exchanges, wallet providers, and providers of financial services for ICOs, are expected to be subject to AML/CFT regulations. This should be done by licensing, registering, or monitoring these entities to ensure their compliance with existing regulations.This follows similar guidelines that have been implemented in South Korea, where anonymous trading has been banned and stricter guidelines for exchanges are being implemented, including the use of AML/CFT, as well as Know-Your-Customer (KYC) requirements.At the end of October, the Federal Financial Monitoring Service of the Russian Federation urged members of the FATF to implement these changes. The Russian service wants to put rules in place to control crypto transactions of 600,000 rubles or more (about $9,120).In a Russian context, there are no official regulations governing the use and trade of cryptocurrencies, although a draft bill is still in preparation.This seemingly puts the FATF recommendations in perspective, as they seem to be the only real standard that different countries can fall back on to deal with cryptocurrencies in a broad perspective.Just a day before the FATF released its newest recommendations, Switzerland-based Capital Markets and Technology Association (CMTA) published its own updated AML standards for digital assets and distributed ledger technologies (DLT).The document outlines compliance standards for virtual asset issuers, guidelines for classifications of initial coin offerings (ICOs) as well as directions for banks, securities dealers and other financial institutions looking to get involved with cryptocurrencies or blockchain-based projects.In September, a Belgian report was issued that called for the regulation of cryptocurrencies and ICOs at a European level. These were led in order to manage potential risks as well as developing the use of blockchain technology.The European Union has already made it clear that it will work on cryptocurrency classification and management over the next 12 months, according to European Commission Vice President, Valdis Dombrovskis. A pressing concern once again is the threat of money-laundering and fraud.While the FATF has provided general guidelines for the international community to follow, the U.K. has done its own homework on the sector – in addition to being a member of the FATF.In March 2018, a Cryptoasset Taskforce was established by the HM Treasury, the Financial Conduct Authority and the Bank of England. This has culminated in a final report, which was published at the end of October.The report maintains that there are multiple benefits to be gained from blockchain technology, described as distributed ledger technology in the report. However, it maintains an air of negativity and skepticism towards cryptocurrencies:“There is limited evidence of the current generation of cryptoassets delivering benefits, but this is a rapidly developing market and benefits may arise in the future. There are substantial potential risks associated with cryptoassets, and the most immediate priorities for the authorities are to mitigate the risks to consumers and market integrity, and prevent the use of cryptoassets for illicit activity.”The report recommends that cryptocurrencies that meet the standards of existing regulations must be treated as such.Meanwhile, newer cryptocurrencies that pose challenges to older financial regulations will require international coordination to ensure they are treated accordingly.These recommendations have been met with some skepticism as well, with a report labelling proposed regulations as a “blunt instrument approach.” The companies involved in compiling the report suggested that a heavy-handed approach could actually stifle the development of cryptocurrencies and various fintech companies.As it stands, the current guidelines from the FATF are non-binding, they mainly serve as advisory parameters for regulators and governments to follow and apply to cryptocurrency operations in their respective locations.In conjunction with the October update to its recommendations, FATF president, Marshall Billingslea, announced the plans to release governing rules for the crypto industry by June 2019, according to Reuters.A number of European countries have enforced their own rules and regulations for cryptocurrencies, wallet providers, and other associated businesses.Nevertheless, those member states that haven’t enforced any regulation of cryptocurrency trade can expect to be given a directive from the FATF next year.Cointelegraph has reached out to the FATF for comment – and has not received a formal reply at the time of publication."

In response to SEC pressure, dozens of firms have reportedly “quietly agreed” to refund investors’ money and pay fines, rather than attempt to reach a legal compliance.According to Yahoo and Decrypt’s conversations with more than 15 industry sources, many startups that were subpoenaed by the SEC did not know how to satisfy the commission’s demands, and were unable to consult with other firms on how to handle the matter.The sources — who are represented by employees of subpoenaed companies or their attorneys — preferred to stay anonymous due to an SEC restriction from disclosing the issue.An anonymous securities attorney at a high-profile Silicon Valley firm told Yahoo and Decrypt that while “everybody’s holding their breath,” waiting for new rules, the SEC is not going to provide them. According to the anonymous attorney, while dealing with the recently emerged industry, the SEC still applies the “same laws, the same statutes, the same rules, to stocks and bonds and everything else.”As previously reported by Cointelegraph, there has been a “cascade of uncertainty,” associated with the existing ICO token classification, which only further complicates the development of desperately needed regulations for ICOs.While major altcoin Ethereum (ETH) was launched back in July 2015, the SEC stated that the cryptocurrency would be regulated as a security only in June this year. Despite calls for regulatory clarity and comments from lawakers that the ICO industry needs “light touch” regulation, the SEC continues its crackdown on ICOs.According to a recent study by financial research firm Autonomous Research, ICOs raised $20 billion since the start of 2017, which is $18 billion more than the previous year. With that, more than 80 percent of ICOs that were conducted in 2017 have been identified as scams by the ICO advisory firm Statis Group in July. Still, the U.S. is ranked the “most favorable” country for the ICO market, based on amount of funds raised by top companies in the field."

According to reports, the move was prompted by the firm’s alleged involvement in illicit financial practices.","Ebang International operates in the field of Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) chip design and production, telecommunications services, and the development, manufacture and sale of blockchain processors, or miners. In 2017, the company’s market share reportedly was 11 percent in terms of sales revenue, totalling 9.79 billion yuan ($1.4 billion). The annual profit of the company was 385 million yuan ($55.2 million) in 2017.In June, Ebang filed a listing application with the HKEx, in addition to submitting a prospectus for an Initial Public Offering (IPO). Sina Finance reports that Ebang planned to go public on Oct. 16, however the company was ostensibly accused of illicitly using over 500 million yuan ($71.7 million).An investigation of a 524.9 million yuan ($74.6 million) transaction between investment and wealth management portal Yindou.com and Ebang, reportedly discovered that in 2017, Cui Hongwei, the wife of Yindou director Li Yonggang, transferred the funds to Ebang. Between March and April 2018, Ebang supposedly transferred 380 million yuan ($54.5 million) back to Cui Hongwei, but 144.9 million yuan ($20.8 million) were lost.According to Sina Finance, Ebang received the funds from Yindou.com for money laundering, inflating sales revenue, or collecting a fictitious sales contract for the deposit, all in order to make their listing on HKEx go more smoothly.Ebang reportedly explained the alleged loss of 144.9 million yuan as a regular business relationship between Yindou.com and Ebang for the purchase of cloud computing server equipment. Sina Finance states that total order amounts of specific items are unknown.On Oct. 12, a request was reportedly submitted to the HKEx in order to prevent Ebang from listing on the exchange. The claim subsequently put Ebang’s listing application under investigation by the Listing Department, which is now supposedly reviewing relevant information in order to decide whether further action is needed.At press time, Ebang has not responded to Cointelegraph’s request for comment.Another Chinese mining equipment manufacturer Bitmain has also been caught in questionable practices ahead its IPO.

Blockchain tech firm BitGo was set to be responsible for developing RMG’s multi-signature crypto wallet.The project had been pitched as an easy way for investors to buy and trade the physical gold held in the vaults of the 1,100 year-old institution, and an additional revenue stream for the Mint as use of physical coins in mass circulation declines.The RMG project had originally been slated for launch in fall 2017, and looked set to go ahead in early 2018, but three unnamed sources told Reuters the Royal Mint had been left without a trading partner at the last minute. One alleged that “CME’s management changed, and they walked away, didn’t want to get involved.”The sources claimed that CME’s exit reflects its broader “cooling of enthusiasm towards digital assets,” notwithstanding the fact that the platform was among the first to launch Bitcoin (BTC) futures contracts last year. Reuters reports that CME has also invested in digital assets startups via its venture capital arm.One of Reuters’ sources claimed that “priorities shifted” away from digitization following the retirement of CEO Phupinder Gill in late 2016, followed by that of CME’s head of digitization, Sandra Ro, last July. In an official comment to Reuters, CME refuted the claims, saying:“It is not correct to say we have ‘de-emphasised’ digitization and remain committed to pursuing our digitization strategy.”In the wake of CME’s exit, the Royal Mint is said to have attempted to salvage the project by means of a partnership with an unnamed crypto exchange, a plan reportedly then quashed by the U.K.’s finance ministry earlier this year.Sources told Reuters that the Finance Ministry blocked the move due to concerns over potential damage to both institutions’ reputations, given the Royal Mint is wholly owned by the British government.As reported, the U.K government does not broadly regulate crypto or crypto exchanges, except for certain derivatives such as crypto-based Contract For Differences (CFDs).The Royal Mint is quoted by Reuters as saying that “sadly, due to market conditions this did not prove possible at this time, but we will revisit this if and when market conditions are right.”Earlier this year, Australia’s largest precious metal refinery, Perth Mint, unveiled its own plans to create its a gold-backed cryptocurrency."

Additionally, the security breach caused the immobilization of $4,000 worth of the SpankChain’s internal token called BOOTY.While most of lost or immobilized funds belong to SpankChain itself, the platform claimed that client reimbursements are of “immediate priority.” The company will shortly repay $9,300 worth of Ethereum and Booty coins directly to users’ SpankPay accounts via Ethereum airdrop.The SpankChain team has subsequently halted its camservice Spank.Live in order to prevent users from depositing via the payment channel smart contract. The website reboot is expected to take around two to three days in order to reset the payment channel smart contract, carry out airdrop reimbursements, reset native token distribution, and eliminate the security weakness.The attack was related to a “reentrancy” bug similar to that which exploited The Decentralized Autonomous Organization (The DAO). The hacker reportedly created a malicious contract mimicking an ERC20 token, with a “transfer” function calling back into the payment channel smart contract multiple times in a loop, extracting Ethereum each time.A smart contract is a protocol that enables the specific behavior of a contract by applying the terms of the agreement into the code, eliminating the need for a third party intermediary.While smart contracts are reportedly “extremely difficult to hack,” they are still a young technology, and can be prone to bugs, which may in turn be exploited by scammers.The adult entertainment industry is increasingly taking advantage of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, mostly driven by the technology’s inherent anonymity, as well as a number of other benefits."

The exchange subsequently filed a lawsuit against the bank, which was eventually dropped.As reported on Oct. 8, Bitfinex was at the center of rumors claiming the exchange was insolvent and/or facing banking issues. The rumors were caused by last week’s reports that the exchange’s banking partner, Puerto Rico’s Noble Bank International, is seeking a buyer and had lost Bitfinex as a client. Bitfinex subsequently denied those rumors.Today’s report follows news that Bitfinex temporarily suspended all fiat wire deposits for the euro, U.S. dollar, Japanese yen and U.K. pound sterling on Oct. 11, without specifying the reason. The exchange further stated that deposits are “expected to resume within a week.”Earlier today, Bitfinex announced the introduction of a “new, improved and increasingly resilient” fiat deposit system. The new deposit process will reportedly enable know-your-customer (KYC)-compliant customers “from around the world” to conduct deposits in the four previously suspended fiat currencies.Deposit requests will be reviewed within 48 hours, while the deposit itself, as Bitfinex states, will be processed “within 6-10 business days.”Founded in 2012 in Hong Kong, Bitfinex is currently the 4th largest crypto exchange globally in terms of trade volume, with $321 million in trades over the last 24 hours at press time. Bitfinex introduced fiat operations in 2015 to enable traders to “enter the digital asset space.”At press time, Bitfinex could not be reached for comment regarding the reported banking developments."

Crypto Platform Sees Its User Base Grow Amid the Global Pandemic.","Oct 20, 2018",A new report published Oct. 19 by Big Four auditor Ernst and Young has found that initial coin offerings (ICOs) that raised capital in 2017 have done “little to inspire confidence” one year on.,"The report, which is dedicated to what EY dubs the “The Class of 2017,” revisits the same projects the firm first analyzed back in Dec. 2017; the sample comprises over 141 “top” ICOs, representing 87 percent of total ICO funding that year.One year later, EY’s statistics are stark: 86 percent of project tokens are reportedly currently trading below their listing price, with 30 percent having lost “substantially all value.” Overall, the report continues, “an investor purchasing a portfolio of The Class of 2017 ICOs on 1 January 2018 would most likely have lost 66% of their investment.”Beyond investment returns, the auditor also analyzed the development of working products or prototypes, finding that at present, only 29 percent of studied projects had either – up just 15 percent from at the end of last year.71 percent of projects have “no offering in the market at all.”Of those projects that do offer a functional product or prototype, seven reportedly accept fiat currencies as payment alongside their native tokens, which EY suggests is a decision that “reduces the value” of investors’ tokens. One has even reportedly stopped accepting token payments altogether. Many of those projects with working products, EY suggests, are:“Abandoning their ICO investors by de-emphasizing the role of their tokens [….] projects accepting fiat usually offer some benefits for token users, similar to points in traditional loyalty programs. However, users do not use utility tokens to store value. To use the platform, users have to purchase the necessary amount and incur related transaction costs and token volatility risk.”EY continues to outline the apparent double bind that faces many projects; “[t]o become a means of payment, utility tokens have to be stable. If it remains stable, the token is of little interest to speculative investors.”The auditor found that only ten ICO tokens have seen any gains, which it says are “mostly” in the blockchain infrastructure category; nonetheless, such growth has done little to counter the Ethereum (ETH) platform’s industry “dominance,” EY argues.Paul Brody, global innovation leader for blockchain technology at EY, told The Globe and Mail in an interview, “this looks worse than we thought.” He compared the ICO landscape with the bleak fate of the late 1990s’ internet startups – in the latter’s favor. Brody singled out one dot-com era boom-and-bust casualty as an example: “At least from Pets.com you could get pets food, [t]hey had an actual working business... a product.”As previously reported, data through Sept. 2018 corroborates that Ethereum remains the dominant platform for issuing tokens, with a share of almost 90 percent; some have observed this has left many ICO projects exposed to the altcoin’s market losses this year.Conversely, others have argued that it is ICO developers themselves – who are cashing out their ETH holdings to spend on product development  – that have contributed to the price weakness in the 2018 Ethereum market."

which officially became the very first comic book about Bitcoin.","Oct 31, 2018",Move over DC and Marvel: a fledgling company wants to create a comic book universe where crypto and blockchain are at its center – building an immersive experience for readers with a whole new suite of coveted collectibles.,"Tokenville says comics offer an exciting format for entertaining crypto enthusiasts, not to mention enlightening those who are new to the community. It also believes that non-fungible tokens and decentralized apps (DApps) mean this medium can become more interactive than ever before – meaning everything from comic book characters to strips (and even the front covers of issues) can become tokenized.The business is close to releasing its first effort in infusing comics with blockchain – known as The Crypto Treasures. Designed by the renowned comic book author Vitaly Terletsky, the storyline centers on the so-called “Myths of Crypto.” Set in ancient times, it explores the clashes between Good and Evil as they both pursue a mythical beast known as “Mass Adoption.”Tokenville’s argument is that, when you think about it, the crypto world has established its own mythology over the past 10 years of existence. The team said: “There is an own genesis with Satoshi as a creator, stories of rise and fall, friendship and betrayal and own heroes and villains contending for a MacGuffin of mass adoption.”It says that The Crypto Treasures will stand out from other comic books for two main reasons. Firstly, readers will be able to purchase mystic artifacts in the form of non-fungible ERC-721 tokens – and trade them through a marketplace. Collecting special artifacts will also give them the chance to win a jackpot. In order to access the comic, readers pay for a subscription using non-fungible tokens too.Further titles are already in the works. Tokenville has teamed up with CryptoKitties to develop a new show known as Crypto Detective, as the collectibles brand attempts to expand its so-called “KittyVerse.” The stars of this particular title will include genuine CryptoKitties submitted by their owners for participation.Tokenville says the crypto community has always been closely tied with geek culture – and many industry leaders have long had an affinity for comic art.The company acknowledges there have been several projects in the past which have sought to inject the crypto universe into comics. They have included Bitcoin: The Hunt For Satoshi Nakamoto – a graphic novel which officially became the very first comic book about Bitcoin. Available in regular bookstores after a successful crowdfunding campaign, the title capitalizes on the mystery surrounding Nakamoto – resulting in a dramatic tale where he is admired and idolized by the public but pursued by the mafia and the National Security Agency.Crypto-driven comic books have also been able to achieve a different purpose: satire.A good example has been found on Reddit, where Cryptos decided to create strips which feature digital currencies as the characters – gaining hundreds of thousands of fans in the process. In one example, Bitcoin tries to buy a coffee, only to find out that it will cost $31: $3 for the drink and $28 in transaction fees. Although they reluctantly pay, they then need to wait for the payment to go through – and the scene gradually changes from day to night before they receive the coffee, poking fun at the rather slow transaction times this cryptocurrency has faced.The TV Token, which fuels the Tokenville ecosystem and provides access to comics for users, is available on the HitBTC exchange. Disclaimer.

Bitcoin mining industry. On Oct. 17, the Bill and Melinda Gates 
Foundation ...","Oct 21, 2018","The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.","The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.On Oct. 15, some market participants dumped stablecoin Tether as its CEO, who is also the CEO of Bitfinex, faced rumors of insolvency of both companies. Tether briefly lost its peg to the U.S. dollar as the traders sold it and lapped up other cryptocurrencies, providing a temporary boost in the total crypto market capitalization to about $220 billion.However, after the initial frenzy, most digital currencies gave up their intraday gains and stabilized at lower levels.Though most of the top cryptocurrencies are stuck in a range, there are a few that are showing signs of bottoming out. Let’s look at the top five digital currencies with a market capitalization of $1 billion or more, which have risen the most in the past seven days.Stellar bagged the pole position by gaining about 15 percent in the past seven days. There were a couple of events that have helped it rise in a dull market.Rumors were making rounds that the new platform for institutional investors launched by the multinational financial industry heavyweight Fidelity will use XLM blockchain for moving digital assets.The listing of XLM on the Coinsuper crypto exchange has also been well-received by the investors. Another positive news was the announcement of a partnership between Stellar and cryptocurrency exchange Hyperion, a subsidiary of a Canadian firm Global Blockchain Technologies.Can Stellar maintain its momentum or is it nearing critical overhead resistances? Let’s find out.The XLM/USD pair topped out in the first week of this year at $0.98239146, and since then it has been in a downtrend. It is currently trading inside a descending triangle, which will complete on a breakdown and close (UTC time frame) below the support.However, on the downside, the bears haven’t been able to sustain below $0.184 in 2018. The digital currency has bounced off this critical support three times already. Repeated failure of the bears to break down of a level is a positive sign. It shows accumulation by strong hands when price corrects to this level.Now, if the bulls continue their purchases at higher levels and break out of the downtrend line of the triangle, it will invalidate the bearish pattern. A failure of a bearish pattern is a bullish sign.Therefore, a close (UTC time frame) above the triangle is likely to attract buying and start a new uptrend that can carry XLM to $0.47, and above that to $0.63.Our bullish view will be negated if the bears break down and sustain the price below $0.184.The second best-performing cryptocurrency that is showing almost double-digit growth is Ripple, which has been in the news this whole month. Cory Johnson, chief market strategist at Ripple Labs has suggested that the White House might be interested in pushing XRP adoption, to counter China’s dominant position in the Bitcoin mining industry.On Oct. 17, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation Deputy Director and Principal Technologist Miller Abel announced a partnership with Ripple Labs Inc. and digital payments firm Coil. With several positive news to help the price action, Ripple has made a small comeback this week. Can this continue or will the coin give up its recent gains?   The XRP/USD pair has been in a downtrend in 2018. It has repeatedly failed to hold on to the support levels and has been making new lows at regular intervals.Currently, it is trading below both the 20-week EMA and the 50-week SMA, but is trying to form a higher low at $0.37185. The previous low was $0.25300. If the bulls succeed in pushing the price above $0.76440, it will indicate a probable bottom and might signal the start of a new uptrend. The higher levels to watch on the upside are $0.96 and $1.22.On the downside, if the cryptocurrency breaks down of $0.25, it can sink to a new low. We believe that traders should wait for buying to emerge before initiating any long positions.NEO celebrated the second anniversary of their mainnet launch and the market cheered the event by pushing the price higher by 5 percent in the past seven days.The NEO/USD pair is looking weak as it is trading close to its year-to-date low of $13.60337627. There has been no visible bounce since early August, which shows a lack of buying interest. A break of the support levels will be very negative and can result in a drop to the next support at $6.47815308.On the upside, NEO will face a stiff resistance at the 20-week EMA that is close to the horizontal resistance at $28.49944165. A break out of this level might start a new rally to $43, and above that to $60, where it might face resistance from the 50-week SMA. Above this level, the move can extend to $100.We believe that the traders should wait for a new buy setup to form before establishing any new positions in it.Input-Output Hong Kong (IOHK) announced that its Icarus project was audited by a third-party independent security auditor Kudelski Security. This will purportedly ensure that Cardano’s wallet is secure for customers.Cardano has shrugged off the infighting as the price went up by about 5 percent in the past seven days. Let’s see if the coin is showing signs of a turnaround.At the current levels, the ADA/USD pair has fallen about 94 percent from its all-time highs. For about a month and a half, the digital currency has been trading in a tight range of $0.060105–$0.094256. A break out of this range might attract buyers, pushing the price towards the 20-week EMA, followed by a move to $0.2.On the other hand, a break down of the range can result in a drop to $0.033677. Therefore, traders should wait for a new buy setup to form before attempting a long position on Cardano.Hackers have siphoned off 65,000 EOS from the operational wallet of EOSBet, a gambling dApp. This is the second attack within 60 days but the traders have shrugged off this news and the digital currency is up 3 percent in the past seven days.The EOS/USD pair has been trading in the range $4.4930–$6.8299 for more than two months. The positive thing is that the bulls haven’t allowed the price to slip to the critical support at $3.8723. Instead, they are attempting to form a higher low at $4.4930.However, they haven’t been able to break out of the overhead resistance, which shows profit booking at higher levels.The 20-week EMA and the horizontal resistance are both at $6.8299, which makes this an important level to watch on the upside. If this level is crossed, the digital currency can move up to $9.4456, followed by a sharp rally to $15.On the other hand, if the bears succeed in breaking down of $3.8723, the virtual currency can plunge to $2.4, followed by a drop to $1.7.  The traders should wait for the overhead resistance to be scaled before buying."

Crypto Platform Sees Its User Base Grow ...","Oct 16, 2018","Major crypto exchange Bitfinex has introduced an “improved” fiat deposit system, shortly after temporary suspension of deposits last week, according to an official blog post Tuesday, Oct. 16.","Last week, on Oct. 11, Bitfinex temporarily halted fiat deposits in four fiat currencies – the Euro (EUR), U.S. Dollar (USD), Japanese Yen (JPY), and Pound Sterling (GBP) – without specifying a reason for suspension and claiming that fiat deposits are “expected to resume within a week.”Yesterday, October 15, the crypto exchange posted an update on fiat deposits, explaining that Bitfinex had “temporarily paused” fiat deposits for “certain user groups [...] in the face of processing complications.”The company also stressed that all crypto and fiat withdrawals were processing without any interference.In today’s announcement, the Bitfinex team introduced a “new, improved and increasingly resilient” fiat deposit system.The exchange claims the new system will again enable know-your-customer (KYC)-compliant customers “from around the world” to conduct deposits in the four previously suspended fiat currencies.According to the statement, the new system will require users to process a deposit request, which will then be reviewed within 48 hours. The deposit itself, as Bitfinex states, will be processed “within 6-10 business days.”The blog post also states that the minimum fiat deposit amount is to remain at $10,000, with a 0.1 percent processing fee.Founded in Hong Kong in 2012, Bitfinex is one of the oldest and most popular crypto exchanges, currently ranked in third place globally in terms of daily trading volume, according to CoinMarketCap.The company introduced fiat operations in 2015 in a move to enable traders to “enter the digital asset space,” as mentioned in a recent blog post published prior to fiat deposit suspension.Last week, the exchange issued an official response to a recent swathe of online rumors that it is “insolvent” or facing banking issues. Bitfinex’s rebuttal came in the wake of last week’s reports that the exchange’s banking partner had lost both Bitfinex and affiliated firm Tether — who share a CEO, Jan Ludovicus van der Velde — as clients, among other reports."

HIVE Blockchain Acquires Bitcoin Mining Facility for $2.8M.","Nov 13, 2018","Japanese multinational cybersecurity firm Trend Micro has detected a new strain of crypto-mining malware that targets PCs running Linux, according to a report published Nov. 8.","The new strain is reportedly able to hide the malicious process of unauthorized cryptocurrency-mining through users’ CPU by implementing a rootkit component. The malware itself, detected by Trend Micro as Coinminer.Linux.KORKERDS.AB, is also reportedly capable of updating itself.According to the report, the combination of hiding and self-upgrading capabilities gives the malware a great advantage. While the rootkit fails to hide the increased CPU usage and the presence of a running crypto-mining malware, it is also improved by updates, which can completely repurpose the existing code or tools by editing a few “lines of code,” the report notes.The new crypto-mining malware strain infects Linux PCs via third-party or compromised plugins. Once installed, the plugin reportedly gets admin rights, with malware able to be run with privileges granted to an application. In this regard, Trend Micro mentioned another case of Linux-targeting crypto malware that used the same entry point, and took place in September this year.Based on web server statistics, the estimated market share of Linux on personal computers amounted to around 1.8 percent in 2016. The share of Microsoft Windows systems in 2016 was around 89.7, while Mac OS served around 8.5 percent of users.Recently, Cointelegraph reported that a group of South-Korean hackers will face trial for a cryptojacking case that allegedly infected more than 6,000 computers with malicious crypto-mining malware.In September, a report revealed that leaked code targeting Microsoft systems, which hackers allegedly stole from the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA), sparked a fivefold increase in cryptocurrency mining malware infections."

Blockchain Firm's DApp for Ads Now Available on Facebook and Twitter.","Oct 22, 2018","At the Money 20/20 conference in Las Vegas today Oct. 22, experts in the blockchain field debated the future of the technology and its potential effects on how payments are conducted.","Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer David Schwartz and FIS Payments Senior Vice President of Product Strategy Esther Pigg offered competing visions of whether blockchain will benefit payments.According to Schwartz, blockchain technology will replace the world’s current payment systems, the developers of which are “putting bandages on a system that dates back to the dial-up era.”Blockchain will do to payment systems what email did to traditional post, Schwartz said. In his view, blockchain based payment systems will allow for smaller and more frequent payments that do not exist in the current payments ecosystem, because it is too slow and expensive:“If you look in your email right now I’m sure 99 percent of what you see would never have been a postal mail. They’re too low value, they can’t tolerate time delay. We have payments that can’t tolerate time delay and they just don’t happen [...] what will happen is the companies that can provide those high-speed low-cost payments will get the business, and those that don’t will have to adapt or die, just like in any technological revolution.”Schwartz further argued that blockchain is “the right technology” for a new payments system because it is secure and allows “every participant to verify personally every system rule.” He further stated that “blockchains are “fundamentally reliable.”Pigg began her argument by posing the question “what problem does blockchain solve that cannot be solved with existing payment platforms equally as well.”She said that claims about blockchain’s ability to reduce costs are overstated, referencing statements from Western Union’s CEO that its blockchain pilot with Ripple did not produce financial benefits for the company. Pigg noted the significant administrative and infrastructural costs for maintaining a blockchain.Blockchain is also not as secure as its purported to be, according to Pigg, in that while it does offer some security, it cannot predict or detect criminal behavior on its own. She said that, while there is room for improvement, current payment systems are reliable and secure.Pigg concluded by saying that blockchain has potential, and should be explored, but it is “not clearly understood nor vetted,” and will “absolutely not” replace today’s payment platforms."

De Souza is currently being prosecuted for bribery in the infamous Odebrecht case, characterized by the U.S. government as “the largest foreign bribery case in history.”As explained by O Globo, the head of DERSA allegedly transferred a total of 25 million Swiss francs (approximately $25 million) to the accounts of Panama-based offshore company Nantes Group, which were apparently operated by a private Swiss bank Bordier & Cie. De Souza himself appeared as a beneficiary of those accounts.However, the report states, prosecutors suspect that Nantes Group was not the final destination for the laundered sum. In February 2017, the amount was reportedly transferred to accounts in Deltec Bank & Trust, with headquarters in Bahamian capital Nassau — the very same bank that recently partnered with the team behind controversial USD-backed stablecoin Tether.According to O Globo, Brazilian prosecutors are now waiting for a response from Bahamas officials to learn if the mentioned amount actually found its way to Deltec Bank & Trust. The newspaper also notes that Brazil has successfully collaborated with the Bahamas in money laundering cases before.Tether announced its partnership with Deltec Bank & Trust Ltd. shortly after reportedly parting ways with Puerto Rico’s Noble Bank International. Noble Bank had also allegedly held accounts for major crypto exchange Bitfinex, who shares a CEO with Tether.The troubled stablecoin has continuously been rumoured to lack the necessary cash reserves to back all of its 1.7 billion circulating tokens 1:1 with the U.S. dollar – though the legitimacy of the coin has been unofficially confirmed, the firm has failed to complete a public audit by a third party.Announcing its partnership with the Bahamas-based bank last week, Tether stated that it had passed the bank’s due diligence processing.

Crypto Market Trading — Inside Look From Those Earning a Living Off ...","Oct 25, 2018", ,"On October 18, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced the launch of the agency’s Strategic Hub for Innovation and Financial Technology (FinHub). The new arm of the regulator will be focused on fintech-related fields, including, specifically, distributed ledger technology (DLT) and digital assets.The SEC, being an independent federal agency responsible for protecting investors from fraud schemes, has been trying to regulate the crypto market in the U.S. However, due to the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies and lack of federal regulatory framework, the agency’s purview has been significantly limited: the SEC had issued numerous public warnings for investors and fought crypto scammers on a case-by-case basis in the past, but has been unable to come through with more precise, blanket regulatory solutions.Consequently, in July, U.S. Rep. Bill Huizenga’s highlighted the watchdog’s limited possibilities before Congress. The lawmaker argued that financial regulators such as the SEC should be given more power to regulate the cryptocurrency market in compliance with the same rules governing other currencies and stocks. The pressure increased further in September, when a group of other lawmakers from Congress sent a letter to the SEC Chairman, Jay Clayton, asking his agency to tell investors how they plan to regulate digital currencies:""It is important that all policy makers work toward developing clearer guidelines between those digital tokens that are securities, and those that are not, through better articulation of SEC policy, and, ultimately, through formal guidance or legislation.""In October, Yahoo Finance and Decrypt Media published a joint investigation on the SEC’s actions on the crypto market, suggesting that the watchdog had expanded its crackdown on Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs). Nevertheless, regulatory ambiguity remained, the report authors argued — the watchdog still relied on pre existing laws for its alleged clearout.The new FinHub, in turn, “replaces and builds on the work of several internal working groups at the SEC” that have approached blockchain and cryptocurrencies, among others, as per the regulator’s press release. It will be lead by Valerie A. Szczepanik, Senior Advisor for Digital Assets and Innovation and Associate Director in the SEC's Division of Corporation Finance, who has been dubbed as “the first crypto czar” by the community. Szczepanik seems to root for the healthy balance between investor protection and facilitating technology development, as Cointelegraph previously reported. In many ways, the Finhub seems to be the answer to the above mentioned letter sent to Jay Clayton.Essentially, FinHub is a portal that aims to streamline communication between the SEC and the public. More specifically, it attempts to help fintech startups — ICOs included — to achieve full compliance with the watchdog before rolling out their product. As SEC Chairman Clayton states in the press release,""The FinHub provides a central point of focus for [SEC’s] efforts to monitor and engage on innovations in the securities markets that hold promise, but which also require a flexible, prompt regulatory response to execute our mission.""   In her comment for Forbes, Szczepanik was more brief and straightforward:“We’ve been doing these things for years. This is going to bring it all together [...] We’ve found it incredibly helpful to hear from folks, especially in fast-moving areas like DLT”Thus, FinHub’s key feature is communication: the website allows to contact SEC staff members and even request a meeting by submitting a corresponding form via a large button titled “engage with FinHub”. Starting next year, the hub also plans to run a FinTech Forum focusing on DLT and digital assets.Additionally, the FinHub’s website promotes information regarding the SEC’s activities on the crypto market: for instance, there’s a link to February’s Chairman’s testimony on virtual currencies and the agency’s investor bulletin for ICOs, along with other educational articles like “5 things you need to know about ICOs”.Whilst the FinHub seems to be a sign that the SEC is looking to apply more regulation on the crypto market, its actual output is yet unclear. Nevertheless, the hub still represents a more advanced approach for a federal regulator to educate the masses and facilitate compliance on the market: in the past, the SEC relied on general public warnings and a mock ICO website that redirected clueless visitors to Investor.gov website.Interestingly, according to the FinHub website, the portal aims to work with “both domestic and international regulators” regarding emerging technologies, which might prove beneficial for the blockchain industry on the global scale.Thus, the new SEC’s center suggests that less industry players will be left in the dark now, as they will get more options to stay in touch with the regulating body. However, that raises another question — will the SEC be able to provide clear answers regarding its regulations for those players, giving the fact that they still haven’t actually replied to the Congressmen?"

That license would allow the firm to conduct crypto trading and investments business for other banks and qualified investors.In September, SEBA had noted that it planned to start to expand its operations into major financial hubs beginning with Zurich in 2019.According to Bühler, SEBA now intends to raise further growth capital of up to 200 million francs ($206 million) via an Initial Coin Offering (ICO). The CEO explaining the company’s goals, also noted that SEBA wants to offer custodian bank functions, going beyond the digital storage of crypto assets:""As a general rule, crypto assets, just like investments in stocks and bonds, must be vested with our custodian bank function to the regulator."" Earlier in November, FINMA had advised banks and other financial institutions via a confidential letter to estimate risk coverage for cryptocurrencies at 800 percent of current market value. The relatively high valuation suggests that the regulator views the investments as very volatile."

She stated:“I’m not convinced that it has a use.”Regarding the efficiency gain associated with the issuance of national currencies onto a distributed ledger, Bullock said that it is “not material” with respect to the other costs in the system. The assistant governor stated that digital currency “certainly would be a simplification,” although:""It isn't a requirement in the sense the inefficiencies we are seeking to resolve here do not reside in that last final exchange of cash in an existing digitized cash system with corresponding securities — that is actually a highly efficient and high-speed exchange.""In June, the central bank of Australia denied it would issue its own cryptocurrencies, calling Bitcoin (BTC) “fascinating” but “inefficient.” Tony Richards, head of the RBA’s payments policy, stated that issuing the bank’s own token is “not a high priority for us, but it's something we're continuing to work on.”Also in June, Board director of the Swiss National Bank (SNB) Thomas Moser said that cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology are too primitive to consider issuing a state-backed digital currency. Moser compared blockchain in its present condition with the “useless innovation” of compact discs (CDs), stating that “something similar has to happen with BTC. People will only switch to something new if it works better or is cheaper.”"

HetaChain aims to help governmental services, businesses, and organizations create decentralized applications (DApps) and integrate them into different industries, such as banking, e-commerce, robotics, and healthcare.","The new Heta Blockchain 3.0 Platform, launched in 2018 by Relam Investment and its founder, Sultan Ali Rashed Lootah, runs a hybrid of the Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) and a Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT) consensus mechanisms which are designed to bring security to fight against cyberattacks.According to the company, the hybrid consensus algorithm will be able to handle most of the challenges that many blockchain platforms are currently facing. These limitations include issues with security, difficulty in developing DApps, and the speed of the network. For example, Bitcoin can process only seven transactions per second (TPS), compared to Visa which can process 24 TPS. HetaChain says its technology allows for fast TPS “without the risk of downtime.”The core element of HetaChain is Mainchain, the place for storing all of the public tokens. The tokens will be validated by master nodes and Mainchain will also generate multiple private chains that can be private channels for different users like a person, a company or an organization. They will have control over their own chain and will connect to the public MainChain via a special communication protocol.The Heta Blockchain is powered by an internal cryptocurrency, HETA, which can be used to pay usage fees. There are two types of payments: the first one is the transaction fee that is paid once the user exchanges coins or tokens made by Heta. The second fee is an endorsing reward, which is paid when the user is involved in consensus or the validation process of a private chain or MainChain.For users without the knowledge of developing DApps, the platform offers ready solutions in the DApp Store. There will be plug-and-play DApps, software, and smart contracts, pre-built by the community or third parties for the HetaChain ecosystem. Those who want to try to create a simple smart contract can use an auto generation DApp. The company says that anyone with even basic programming skills will be able to handle it by dragging, dropping, and adjusting elements. An off-chain Database will also be available. The project’s development is planned to also be supported by a big data analysis which will be provided by third-party data centers connected to the MainChain.There will be one more Relam Investments’ project powered by HetaChain technology and based on the smart contracts. T-Hub system is the place for integration of stakeholders in business and logistics operations like ports, customs, government agencies. Relam Investments will offer logistics services which are “fast and easy to use.”The founder, chairman and CEO of HetaChain is Sultan Ali Rashed Lootah, who has been a vice chairman of Mashreqbank PSC since March 18, 2015 and its director since 1996. The co-founders of the project are Mr. Ali Juma AlAjme – director of the United Arab Emirate’s Ministry of Health and Prevention’s IT Department, and Duy Phuong Nguyen, the vice chairman of Relam Investment. Nguyen has experience in leading finance and banking projects in Vietnam Industrial Securities and Vietnam Commodities Exchange.Recently, Relam Investments announced their plan of expansion to India. The company said it will start with initial investment of around $250 million in technology startups and real estate projects. "

Nonetheless, the pass rate eventually transpired to be 39 percent.The Times of Malta further reports that the assessment process, as well as the impromptu marking scheme change, has left many prospective practitioners “frustrated.” Alongside individuals, the VFA accreditation is required of any businesses seeking to provide crypto asset services, including investment advice or portfolio management; notably, it is essential for the compliant conduct of any ICO — through token issuance, sale, and trading — on the island.The exam’s coordinator, the Institute of Financial Service Practitioners, has reportedly declined to comment on the matter.The Times of Malta cites an MSFA “consultation document” reportedly from early September that is said to have stated it had “become evident that certain industry players are not sufficiently prepared to register as VFA agents,” advising of the “need to address an existing expectations gap, particularly in view of the inherent risks of this sector.”Due to this, the watchdog reportedly proposed introducing higher capital requirements and regulatory fees as part of its VFA assessment, alongside mandatory “continuous professional education” and the passing of the written certification.Malta has earned a strong reputation for having a robust and transparent crypto regulatory climate, landing it the moniker of “Blockchain Island.” The VFA Act was passed in July 2018 as part of a broader crypto and blockchain regulatory framework that included the Digital Innovation Authority Act and the Innovative Technological Arrangement and Services Act.Also in July, Cointelegraph reported that the world-renowned Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) examination had added cryptocurrency and blockchain to the curriculum, as part of a new section called “Fintech in Investment Management” in its 2019 exam."

Pay-to-Play Gaming Is Flawed, Blockchain-Based Platform Says.","Oct 18, 2018","In some countries around the world, governments have had a stifling effect on the adoption of blockchain technology. Conversely, the government of the UAE and Dubai have been the driving force behind the promotion of blockchain use in the country.","2018 has seen some significant developments on this front but the foundations had been laid a couple of years ago.Across the private and public sectors, there has been a push to incorporate this new tech to overhaul current systems. This includes as plans to launch a cryptocurrency that will be used by citizens and governmental departments.The first proposal for an official Dubai cryptocurrency called emCash came about in October 2017. The cryptocurrency is touted to be used for payments for governmental and nongovernmental services – and is pegged to the UAE Dirham.Consumers could well be using emCash in the next few months after the government signed a deal with a number of parties to setup point of sale payments for the cryptocurrency.The partnership was announced on October 9, which includes emCredit, a subsidiary of the Dubai Department of Economic Development, blockchain payment provider Pundi X and its partner Ebooc Fintech & Loyalty Labs LLC.Ebooc will be responsible for providing point of sale terminals in retail outlets, while Pundi X is expected to create 100,000 point of sale units over the next three years.The Central Bank of the UAE began working on legislation at the beginning of 2017 to address the use of cryptocurrencies in the country.This culminated in a report by Abu Dhabi's Financial Services Regulatory Authority in October 2017, which released its findings on initial coin offerings (ICOs) and cryptocurrencies – classing them as securities and commodities respectively.A swathe of apathy towards ICOs, with bans in countries like China, happened around the same time last year. This had a slight ripple effect, as other institutions and regulatory bodies put out warnings to investors centred on the associated risks of investing in ICOs. This saw UAE Central Bank Governor Mubarak Rashid al-Mansouri caution citizens against the use of cryptocurrencies – amid fears of volatility and criminal uses.This was primarily due to the corresponding drop in value of various cryptocurrencies following China’s ban, as Al-Mansouri said in a speech at the Islamic Financial Services Board Summit:“The risks of trading in digital currencies have clearly appeared when the prices of digital currency fell sharply after some countries announced a ban on using initial coin offerings.”The negative stigma around ICOs seemed to continue into the new year, amid an overall decline in the crypto markets following all time highs in December. In the US, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) led the way with no-nonsense attitude towards ICOs in February 2018.The UAE Securities and Commodities Authority (SCA) also cautioned local investors about the inherent risks associated with ICOs. Given that they are not regulated in the country, investors had no means of legal protection against fraud.In an effort to address these concerns, it is understood that the UAE in nearing the completion of a draft of regulations for ICOs in the country. This was reported in September 2018, and is led by the UAE SCA.In 2016, the foundations were laid for Dubai to uncover startup companies that could help drive the way for the city to become blockchain-powered by 2020.The UAE government founded the Smart Dubai initiative in 2013, an ambitious project looking to provide cutting edge technological innovations across the country, from technology to governmental processes.A central part of the initiative is to improve government efficiency by using blockchain technology, in the hopes of making Dubai a global leader in the space. This includes a transition to digital systems which will see visa applications, bill payments, and license renewals move away from traditional paper documentation.According to Smart Dubai, blockchain technology could redistribute up to 25 million hours of economic productivity by removing the need for paper document processing. The project also promised to benefit the tourism industry in Dubai as international travellers will have fast-tracked entry with pre-approved passport, visas, and security clearances.Moving around the city will also be improved with approved drivers licenses and car rental, wireless connectivity as well as pre-authenticated temporary digital wallets.An official Blockchain Strategy was launched in October 2016, in association with Seed Fund 1776, looking for companies building blockchain-based applications across a broad range of industries. In 2017 Dubai won the City Project award for its blockchain strategy, awarded by the Smart City Expo and World Congress in Barcelona.In conjunction with the Smart Dubai initiative, in April 2018 UAE Vice President and Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid eventually launched the broader UAE Blockchain Strategy 2021. At the time Sheikh Mohammed said that the project could save the UAE government up to $3 billion annually on document circulation, and drastically improve the quality of life and efficiency:“The adoption of this technology will reflect on the quality of life in the UAE and will enhance happiness levels for citizens. 50 percent of government transactions on the federal level will be conducted using Blockchain technology by 2021. This technology will save time, effort, and resources and enable individuals to conduct most of their transactions in a timely manner that suits their lifestyle and work.”Cointelegraph spoke with Muhammed Arafath, executive director at Apla Blockchain, platform helping integrate blockchain technology into government operations in a number of countries including India and the UAE, to get a first hand perspective on the current crypto climate in Dubai:“Considering the vision which the Dubai government has set on being the ‘blockchain capital’ and the commitment for having most if not all of the government applications on Blockchain by 2020, Dubai is one of the most pro-blockchain governments in the region.”Over the past two months, the UAE and Dubai have made significant progress in realizing some of the goals outlined in the Smart Dubai initiative.Partnering with the Dubai Department of Finance, a blockchain-powered payment system was officially launched in September 2018. The Payment Reconciliation and Settlement (PRS) system aims to allow government entities like the Dubai Police, Roads and Transport Authority, and Dubai Health Authority to transact in real-time, providing a transparent system for intergovernmental processes..According to local media outlet Zawya, the Dubai Electricity and Water Authority and the Knowledge and Human Development Authority have already been using the PRS system.The tourism sector in Dubai is also expected to benefit from blockchain technology. In March 2018, plans for a virtual business-to-business tourism-specific marketplace using blockchain were unveiled. The Dubai Tourism Blockchain Marketplace will reportedly provide tourists with a platform that features real-time, transparent pricing of Dubai’s hotels availability.Blockchain technology is also being leveraged to improve other areas of life in Dubai, from the streets of the city to its courts.Thus, in February 2018 the Dubai Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) announced plans to launch a blockchain-based system in 2020 that would track the lifecycle of vehicles in the country.According to media outlet Arabian Business, RTA chairman and executive director Mattar Al Tayer says the initiative should benefit almost every single player in the industry:“The platform benefits many stakeholders including car manufacturers, dealers, regulators, insurance companies, buyers, sellers and even garages, providing transparency and trust in vehicle transactions, preventing disputes and lowering the cost of services. It tracks ownership, sale, and accident history to create smart, more efficient systems for supply chains.”In July, Dubai International Financial Center Courts announced a formal partnership with Smart Dubai in order to set up a ‘Court of the Blockchain’ to facilitate improvements in the judicial system. The move would eventually create a blockchain-powered judiciary to help verify court judgements for cross-border enforcement.Countries like Malta and the UAE seem to be leading the way in terms of blockchain adoption. Having recognized the many benefits of the technology, strides have been made to actively get out ahead of other countries.A seemingly important factor is the balance between accepting this new technology while providing the necessary frameworks to ensure investors are protected.The UAE Blockchain Strategy 2021 is a clear indication of the efforts being made by the country to foster the development of blockchain to improve its own governance and the quality of life for people in the region.This positive and proactive attitude towards the industry is proving a point, as Arafath told Cointelegraph:“Dubai is clearly leading the region by example on the adoption of blockchain and crypto.”As Dubai and the UAE continue to explore and develop technology with the use of blockchain technology, as well as provide a guideline for the use of ICOs and cryptocurrencies, the outlook in the region seems positive."

Coin — plans to use the proceeds from sales of the altcoin to fund various fan engagement projects. Cointelegraph reported at the time of the initial announcement that the issuance will be in partnership with Link Media Partners, a music A&R firm, and will be launched on the TAO network blockchain platform.The Initial Coin Offering (ICO) for O.D.B. Coin forms one of a new range of so-called Initial Artist Offerings (IAOs) by host platform AltMarket.“It’s designed to be an institution that respects the investments of our clients,” Vents quotes AltMarket CEO Bryce Weiner as saying.Ol’ Dirty Bastard was one of the founding members of the Wu Tang Clan rap group, which became famous for its debut album “Enter the Wang-Tu (36 Chambers)” in 1993. O.D.B. passed away in 2004 at the age of 35 of a reported drug overdose.O.D.B.’s son Young Dirty Bastard — whose real name is Barson Unique Jones — told Vents that he “look[s] forward to delivering even more music that would make Dad proud.”The move continues the occasional and sometimes curious trend of music stars’ engagement with the ICO phenomenon and cryptocurrency industry more widely.As Cointelegraph reported, rapper Curtis “50 Cent” Jackson pledged his belief in the technology, claiming he had accrued millions of dollars in Bitcoin (BTC) from a sales stunt several years ago before revealing he had never owned the funds.In September of last year, record producer DJ Khaled publicized his ownership of crypto debit card, the Titanium Centra Card, on Instagram. DJ Khaled has since removed the post, and the founders of Centra have been charged with securities fraud by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ).The formerly Dirty Coin project, now O.D.B.

228,https://cointelegraph.com,"Oct 23, 2018",How Significant is Blockchain in the Mortgage Industry?,https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-significant-is-blockchain-in-the-mortgage-industry,"Related News. Is Bitcoin a Store of Value? Experts on BTC as Digital Gold. 
Pay-to-Play Gaming Is Flawed, Blockchain-Based Platform Says.","Oct 23, 2018",The global residential mortgage market is estimated to be worth $31 trillion. 66 percent of all Americans have a mortgage on their house while in the UK and China it’s as high as 70%. It’s a segment of the financial markets that hits close to home for a large portion of the global population.,"The average mortgage closing costs would typically vary between 2 and 5 percent of the price of the property, including broker fees, loan origination fees, underwriting fees, surveyor fees, legal fees, and title fees. That means on a house of $250,000, the buyer can expect to pay anything between $5,000 and $12,500 just to obtain a mortgage.The mortgage process is heavily centralized and permeated with middlemen who each add their own markup to the overall costs, a perfect target for blockchain. According to a PWC report:“Blockchain technology may radically alter the process through which consumers buy a home, as well as the way financial institutions handle mortgages. Specifically, the technology could remove cost and friction from the process, create transaction records that are infallible and incorruptible, and facilitate near-instantaneous settlement.”Moody’s suggests that the annual cost-savings as a result of blockchain-based application processes could be as high as $1.7 billion and ex-Barclays boss, Antony Jenkins, believes the time savings could be equally significant:""Over time what you could see, for example, is a mortgage being granted in 10 minutes, you could see a letter of credit being granted in two minutes, those types of things.”But how realistic are these claims and exactly where would the blockchain impact be?The current mortgage application process is heavily paper-based, labour intensive, time-consuming, and expensive. This is in most part due to a long line of 3rd party service providers that all have an input into the process, such as surveyors, solicitors, credit agencies, and title deed offices.When a buyer and seller agree to transact on a property, the buyer will apply for a mortgage from their bank, which includes providing several items of documentation such as bank statements, proof of income, existing loan information (if applicable), and consent for a credit report to be compiled by an external credit reporting company.To determine an estimated loan amount, the bank would also approach a surveyor to conduct a preliminary property evaluation, after which it can start the credit approval process based on the information obtained from the buyer and the various 3rd parties.Next, the bank would confirm the property ownership with land registry offices as stated by the seller. A final property valuation will then be requested from a surveyor so that it can be cross checked with the approved amount of credit.The bank can then notify the buyer and solicitors of its decision, after which arrangements are made for the signing of the mortgage loan agreement and mortgage deed. Once the documents are signed, the bank can initiate the drawdown of funds and land registry offices can be informed to update title deeds. In the US, this application process can take anywhere from 30 to 60 days to complete.The traditional mortgage application process leads to 3 main problems: increased costs, extended processing times, and lack of transparency.Current transaction flows require third-party input from credit agencies to help assess loan eligibility, underwriters to calculate and ensure the accuracy of mortgage drawdowns, surveyors to provide up to date property valuations, lawyers to draw up legal documentation, and title offices to confirm and update ownership.Each of these functions is likely to have a large team of administration staff to deal with the physical paperwork. In 2015, PWC reported that “the average mortgage application includes 500 pages, a number that has trended up rather than down in recent years”. Although other reports suggest it could be as much as 2,000 pages.Every intermediary the transaction goes through will add 1% to 2% of the property’s value in their own fees to the overall cost. But it’s not only fees they add, each of them also adds additional days of their own processing time, leading to a long, drawn-out process.Finally, there’s the lack of transparency over the required application documentation. Bank accounts, title deeds, and government records are held by separate institutions. When a person applies for a mortgage, brokers, credit agencies, bank personnel and other 3rd party agents will need access to this information in order to determine if a loan should be approved. Access is usually provided through manual processes, like sending an email request and then receiving the information by email a few days later.Once a mortgage is approved, this same information needs to be updated with every agency, i.e. the title deeds need to show that the property has changed hands, the bank will now keep a record of the mortgage against your name so credit agencies can access this in case of future loan applications.This is again done manually and every time information is passed along, it moves from one ledger to another. This not only requires additional third-party agents to confirm these transactions but it means this paper-based, mostly manual, process is prone to human error, leading to further delays and cost accumulation.To approve a line of credit, banks rely on accurate information from surveyors, law firms, credit agencies, etc. If all of the required information is securely stored on a distributed network with each agent updating their part of the information, banks can easily retrieve the various pieces of information they need from this network, without having to rely on individual, paper-based communications to each of the 3rd party providers. This includes digitized copies of legal documents, property valuations, and title deeds.Blockchain can be used to create a digital ID for each property, therefore making the property traсkable on the network. Apart from making the real estate market more liquid, purely from a mortgage application perspective, this digital ID would include a chain of ownership and current market valuation that will allow banks to quickly verify the current ownership status or confirm the market price, potentially mitigating the need of going through title deeds and engaging with surveyors.DLT could also take it a step further and remove the need for certain intermediaries through smart contract application. Smart contracts can be pre-programmed to only execute upon completion of certain conditions, such as requesting funds to be released to the seller only once the mortgage documentation has been digitally signed, the borrowing bank has approved the mortgage and funds have been transferred to the seller’s bank.The result is that certain roles of costly lawyers in the mortgage application chain could be made redundant. Synechron, a digital business consulting & technology services provider, estimates that these cost savings as a result of removing intermediaries will easily go into the billions:“By automating and securing the mortgage lending processes, a blockchain-based system coordinates and identifies the agents and intermediaries and could reduce operational costs, fees, and fraud for financial institutions. We estimate savings of $177 million on a loan book of $97.7 billion for a typical mortgage lender.”The consultants also believe the application approval time can be significantly reduced:“Blockchain technology is expected to reduce total transaction time throughout the mortgage value chain by 25 percent, to 30 days from 40. If national governments establish a blockchain-based title registry, this is expected to fall a further 25 percent, to 20 days.”The Chinese State bank, Bank of Communications, used Blockchain to issue digital mortgages worth $1.3 Billion in September of 2018, while the world’s fourth-largest bank, The Agricultural Bank of China issued a loan worth around $300,000 for agricultural land on a blockchain network.Similarly, in Russia, a subsidiary of the Raiffeisen Bank International issued an entirely digital mortgage through a blockchain platform called Masterchain, an Ethereum-based platform launched by the Bank of Russia that ensures fast and secure communication between banks and other financial institutions, and allows users to quickly confirm the accuracy of customer data.The complete mortgage document was published in a DDS (decentralized depository system) built on Masterchain, which was then verified by an electronic signature and sent to the state property registry to be checked. After all the documents were checked and signed, a Mortgage Token was issued that went into file storage with the Bank.Bank of China Hong Kong (BOCHK) uses Blockchain to process 85 percent of its mortgage-related property valuations. According to the bank’s general manager of information technology, Rocky Cheng Chung-Ngam, these property valuations are needed to accurately calculate monthly mortgage repayments:“In the past, banks and [real estate] appraisers had to exchange faxes and emails to produce and deliver physical certificates. Now the process can be done on blockchain in seconds.”There are also a number of startups that are using blockchain to streamline the mortgage application process.Moneycatcha uses blockchain to make loan applications cheaper and faster, offers two blockchain-based solutions. Homechain is an end-to-end blockchain solution that retrieves and verifies data fast and securely from third-party data providers, including land offices and government agencies, while Regchain is used for real-time risk monitoring in loan applications. As the company founder, Ruth Hatherley, explains:“The application programming interface we have delivers a superior set of data and also regularly updates it, so we can give any institution an up-to-date, accurate view of their home-loan portfolio within 30 seconds.”  Block66 is another startup that wants to use the technology to increase transparency, streamline the deployment of capital, and overcome geographical lending restrictions. The aim for them is to create a marketplace of pre-vetted borrowers which lenders can then access. According to Block66 CEO, Joe Markham, their platform is developing a new breed of mortgage lending platform:“Our Blockchain platform will store government regulations, internal guidelines provided by lenders, and information on applicants and their property obtained directly from the source.”Other startups include Homelend, which uses blockchain to crowdfund mortgages through a peer-to-peer platform, and the Viva Network, that uses a similar concept.The main challenge is that a lot of personal and sensitive information would be stored on a blockchain-based mortgage network. Although the inherent security of blockchain is robust, there could be several third-party agents plugging into the network which could create weak points. Information security should, therefore, be a top priority and a lot of work has to be done to ensure the online security of customer data.Finally, the work with regulators and comply with legal frameworks in the various jurisdictions will be another challenge to overcome if we truly want to see blockchain-based mortgages going mainstream.According to SEC Chairman, Jay Clayton, “Replacing a traditional corporate interest recorded in a central ledger with an enterprise interest recorded through a blockchain entry on a distributed ledger may change the form of the transaction, but it does not change the substance.”What Clayton means is that certain regulations and laws apply to a mortgage transaction, irrespective if that mortgage is issued through traditional channels or on top of a blockchain network. Regulators will need oversight into the details such as title transfers, electronic signatures, etc. There’s also the question of whether or not smart contracts are actually legally binding, and again, more work and research will have to be done to determine if such a concept is covered in existing legislature or if countries would have to write new laws to cover blockchain and smart contract transactions.Mortgage lending is not something that only affects a niche segment of a population. The majority of people will go through a mortgage application process at some time. Equally, it’s a process that is expensive and time-consuming, fraught with complications, friction, and opaqueness.A lot of interest, combined with significant room for improvement means we are likely to see investment and use cases increase significantly in the future. And the fact that it’s also not a process that is looking to remove traditional lenders, but rather enhance their systems, should further fuel investment and development. According to Eric Piscini, principal, banking and technology consulting at Deloitte, this might very well be the case:“I don’t know if this is removing banks from the process — I think it will make them more efficient. Maybe they’ll be leaner because they won’t need to have as many people as they used to, to manage those processes.”The fact remains that blockchain has the potential to revolutionize the mortgage industry and it is a use case that will benefit both parties at either side of the transaction, i.e. the customer and the financial institutions."

The finding has been revealed in a cyber threat report published by Unit 42 research group on Oct. 11.,"Cryptojacking is the practice of using a computer’s processing power to mine for cryptocurrencies without the owner’s consent or knowledge.According to new research released by Unit 42, Palo Alto Networks' threat intelligence team, the malware strain surreptitiously compels computers to mine Monero (XMR) by installing an “XMRig cryptocurrency miner.”The new malware is said to be particularly harmful, as the developers have copied the pop-up notification from an official Adobe installer. Moreover, the download really does update targets' computers with the latest version of Flash, further adding to its seeming legitimacy. Unit 42 analyst Brad Duncan has stated that:“In most cases, fake Flash updates pushing malware are not very stealthy… [but in this instance, b]ecause of the latest Flash update, a potential victim may not notice anything out of the ordinary.""Unit 42 reportedly uncovered the strain while searching for “popular” fake Flash updates using AutoFocus, a Palo Alto Networks intelligence tool:“77.. malware samples are identified with a CoinMiner tag in AutoFocus.The remaining 36 samples share other tags with those 77 CoinMiner-related executables.”As previously reported, coin miner works by using Coinhive – a JavaScript program created to mine Monero via a web browser. According to Unit 42, samples that deceptively mimic and install an actual Flash update have been in circulation as of August 2018.Just yesterday, Iran’s cybersecurity authority issued a report that claimed that the highest number of recorded incidents of Coinhive infection have taken place in Brazil;  India came in second, followed by Indonesia.As reported in September, cryptojacking malware reports are said to have surged almost 500 percent in 2018.

Cointelegraph ...","Oct 30, 2018","The Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) has released a new set of specifications in an effort to provide standards for developers using private iterations of the Ethereum Blockchain, according to statements shared with Cointelegraph.","At DevCon4 today in Prague, the EEA announced the release of its Enterprise Ethereum Client Specification V2 and Off-Chain Trusted Compute Specification V0.5. The former is a development of common standards, which aims to ensure that Ethereum developers will write code that “[motivates] enterprise customers to select EEA specification-based solutions over proprietary offerings.”The Client Specification V2 will essentially offer a label of sorts, which means a product underwent third party testing in order to be sold as EEA-compliant.The latter spec release is a set of application programming interfaces (APIs) that can move transactions “off-chain” for computation elsewhere, and then move a summary to the “main chain.” EEA APIs using the recently released specs would offer programmers methods of moving data off-chain independent of any one trust verification method. The APIs have been reviewed to be compatible with Trusted Execution Environments, Zero-Knowledge Proofs, and Trusted Multi-Party Compute.Executive Director Ron Resnick said that “enterprises can choose whichever trusted compute methods work best for their use case, whether it is for supply chains, banks, retail, or other large enterprise-based ecosystems.”The EEA aims to broaden its set of standards by onboarding new firms from various industries to its list of member organizations, which numbers over 500. Speaking with Cointelegraph, Resnick stated that he sees further potential for EEAs standards in streamlining the payments process in chemical supply chains, as well as various applications in automotive, trucking, addressing music piracy, and health services.The blockchain standards organization released the first version of its Enterprise Ethereum Client Specification in May. The first spec interaction aimed at interoperability would “basically [be] the catapult that launches the whole ecosystem,” Resnick said at the time. He told Cointelegraph:“Without interoperability, the big players aren’t going to want to jump in, because they don’t want to be locked in to one particular vendor for a proprietary solution [...] It attracts more and more of the bigger players to come in and make a commitment, because they feel a little more safe that they’re not going to get stuck.”"

Platform Sees Its User Base Grow Amid the Global Pandemic.","Oct 14, 2018","On April 10, 2018, 21 EU member states and Norway signed up to create the European Blockchain Partnership. Including the UK, France, Germany, Sweden, the Netherlands and Ireland, they committed themselves to ""cooperate in the establishment of a European Blockchain Services Infrastructure (EBSI) that will support the delivery of cross-border digital public services, with the highest standards of security and privacy.""","Since April, a further five nations have joined the Partnership, with Italy becoming the latest to do so after it signed the Partnership's Declaration in September. As a member, it has committed itself to helping to identify, by the end of 2018, ""an initial set of cross-border digital public sector services that could be deployed through the European Blockchain Services Infrastructure.""By bringing distributed ledger technology (DLT) to European infrastructure, the Partnership hopes to make cross-border services – such as those related to logistics and regulatory reporting – safer and more efficient. However, progress towards this goal has so far been slow and piecemeal, with the Partnership's members having had only three meetings since April. Nonetheless, it retains ambitious aims, with the European Commission telling Cointelegraph that it wants the European Blockchain Services Infrastructure (EBSI) to become an international ""gold standard"" for large-scale DLTs.So far, the Partnership's mission is vaguely defined. While there was already agreement in April that it would work towards developing cross-border, blockchain-based public services, there is still no actual agreement on what particular services to hone in on and develop. The European Commission's head of Digital Innovation and Blockchain, Pēteris Zilgalvis explains:""The Partnership's mission is defined in the Joint Declaration and it is on that mandate that we have to deliver before the end of the year. In the Joint Declaration the signatories committed to working together and with the European Commission in order to develop an EBSI that can support the delivery of cross-border digital public services in Europe. So the description of what this services' infrastructure [EBSI] could look like is what we are currently working on.""In other words, the Partnership's membership is currently at the very early stage of negotiating just what kind of blockchain-based public services to develop. However, as Zilgalvis explained to Cointelegraph, it expects to have agreed on all the fundamental details by the end of the year, so that these can be used as the basis for actually building and rolling out distributed cross-border technologies.""As stated in the Joint Declaration, by end of 2018 the Partnership must provide a set of use cases of cross-border digital public services that could be deployed through the EBSI, a set of functional and technical specifications for the EBSI and finally, a governance model describing how the EBSI will be managed.""The Partnership and its members will therefore be busy for the rest of 2018, although it has only three more meetings left to hammer out the all-important details, having already had three meetings so far. According to Finland's representative to the Partnership, Kimmo Mäkinen, a senior advisor at the Department of Public Sector Digitalization, the most recent meeting took place on September 17. ""This was the third meeting,"" he tells Cointelegraph. ""The main topic was to discuss about the most prominent cross-border blockchain use-cases that had been proposed by member states and by the commission.""As for whether the Partnership will successfully decide on all the necessary parameters before the start of 2019, Mäkinen doesn't offer confirmation. ""We will have three monthly meetings by the end of this year during which we will have to agree not only on use-cases but also technical/functional requirements and governance model for European blockchain infrastructure,"" he says, his use of ""not only"" implying that the Partnership has a more-than sizeable workload to get through before Christmas.Still, even though three meetings and no particular end-product hardly counts as an impressive achievement, these meetings were positive for the Partnership. More importantly, they've revealed a strong commitment among its members towards developing blockchain technologies, as explained by Pēteris Zilgalvis:""At these meetings we found that the Partners were extremely supportive of collective efforts to establish strong EU leadership in distributed ledger technology, drawing on the Digital Single Market framework, and that EBSI could play a very important role in achieving this objective.""Indeed, it would appear that the European Blockchain Partnership is being used by the European Commission as a vehicle for the EU becoming a global leader on DLT.""In the longer term, we would like EBSI to become a global reference when it comes to trusted blockchain infrastructures,"" admits Zilgalvis, ""a 'gold standard' infrastructure that is governed through a transparent multi-stakeholder organisation, meets the most advanced cybersecurity and energy efficiency standards, is scalable to accommodate different use cases, is highly-performant in terms of speed and throughput, ensures the continuity of services on the long term, integrates eIDAS (electronic IDentification, Authentication and trust Services) and supports full compliance with the EU requirements on data protection (General Data Protection Regulation) and network information security.""So even if the Partnership hasn't really achieved anything concrete yet, its significance lies in the fact that it represents a massive vote of confidence in blockchain technology. By committing to it, and by aiming to build ""highly-performant"" blockchain tech, the Partnership's 27 member nations have effectively declared that they believe DLT is here to stay and that it has genuine applicability to a range of areas.Separately, each member is for their own purposes interested in blockchain tech from a variety of different perspectives, further testifying to blockchain's growing status as a promising new solution to a range of problems. ""Finland is interested and curious of new possibilities that are to be presented by blockchain technology,"" acknowledges Kimmo Mäkinen, ""in order to boost cross-border services for example in matters related to document authenticity, data exchange and identity management.""Of course, while there's little doubt that the Partnership's signatories are completely serious about DLT, there still remains the unavoidable question of when, exactly, it will produce and begin introducing the platforms it was set up to build. Well, despite there not being anything absolutely definite on this front, Pēteris Zilgalvis states that we may begin seeing actual output as early as next year:""These deliverables [functional and technical specifications, governance model] will be addressed to the political representatives who signed the Declaration, and if approved, the Partnership could move into implementation mode in 2019.""Once again, this time frame is ambitious. But even if certain differences of opinion may need to be ironed out between members before implementation can begin, the target of 2019 shows just how confident the European Commission is that the Partnership's member states are on the same page with regards to blockchain, which is further indicated by them signing its Declaration in the first place. If the Partnership does indeed follow through with its plans and implements blockchain-based cross-border infrastructure, this will only have positive ramifications and knock-on effects for wider blockchain adoption elsewhere. All of which means that the future of blockchain adoption in Europe looks increasingly bright."

Platform Sees Its User Base Grow Amid the Global Pandemic.","Nov 15, 2018","Blockchain Cuties, a decentralized crypto collectible game operating on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain, has announced that it is now available on EOS. The developer company says the new step makes Blockchain Cuties “the first game which officially supports two blockchains simultaneously.” This is supposed to make transactions faster and the players can now breed both ETH and EOS-based cuties.","The game announced that from now, players can log in to the game using their EOS Wallet and start breeding their first EOS cuties. Blockchain Cuties says importing the private key will take less than a minute – after entering the system the private key will be secured by storing locally. In order to start the game, the players should allocate CPU/Bandwidth and RAM – the resources that users have in the EOS blockchain. The company says that the amount of staked tokens can be “unstaked” at any time.One of the main reasons why Blockchain Cuties decided to implement the EOS blockchain into the game was the non-fungible tokens support that the platform provides. “There are not many blockchain platforms that support such digital assets,” the company says. All the crypto collectibles, or Cuties, are non-fungible tokens that are unique and have cryptocurrency value. These tokens are represented as pets and cute animals that players can buy and sell to each other, or trade on the in-game marketplace. The players can also breed their own fantasy creature by adding mutations which makes their Cutie more expensive.The company says another reason for the cooperation with EOS’ blockchain was its transaction speed, mass adoption and “record-breaking” scalability feat which could solve the scalability issues.EOS is one of the first cryptocurrencies that implemented the Delegated Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism. The company hopes that this technology will allow the platform to enhance scalability up to “millions of transactions per second.”Blockchain Cuties was officially released in April 2018. It became a part of the decentralized crypto games trend started with the launch of CryptoPunks, the first blockchain game ever made, in June 2017. The developers offered to the players to collect, bid and sell digital punks. A few months later, in November 2017, CryptoKitties took over by creating their own market and valuable assets — crypto cats. The developers invented a pioneering approach — making Ethereum networking lag. As the result, CryptoKitties broke the record of a million unique virtual kitties which players bred. The most expensive asset was sold for more than 600 ETH, or about $170,000.Blockchain Cuties became part of the next collectible games’ boom. They expanded the breeding feature from the kitties to other animals including lizards, puppies, bears, and fantastic creatures. Each non-fungible token has its unique genome that players decode, and each unique feature increases the price of the token.Disclaimer.

However, given such a model would make funding amounts less stable, startups would also need more “core funding"" from private investors outside of a the public token sale, he suggested.Despite the persistent bear market in crypto this year, ICOs have reportedly amassed twice as much in funds between January and May 2018 alone, in comparison with the entire year of 2017.On Oct. 28, Germany’s financial regulator urged the global community to regulate ICOs on a worldwide scale, citing “mostly minimal rights” of ICO investors.Oct. 26, the Thai Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued a warning about  investing in nine digital tokens and Initial Coin Offerings that had not been approved by the regulator."

The new guidelines require ICO issuers to provide detailed information about “all persons involved with the ICO.”Issuers must also disclose a review of the project, detailing key aspects of the product or service such as the market audience, financing system, the amount of money that is planned to be raised, and technical aspects associated with software and blockchain specifications.The Royal Gazette reports that Uulala aims to improve financial inclusion of unbanked and underbanked people by providing financial services. The firm has reportedly developed a decentralized peer-to-peer network “to load cash into the digital economy.” Once funds are deposited, users purportedly have access to a virtual MasterCard, with which they can participate in e-commerce, as well as pay bills or send cross-border payments.The company’s CEO Oscar Garcia told the Royal Gazette that Uulala aims to raise $50 million dollars in its token sale, and has already raised $10 million privately. Garcia noted the country’s thorough regulatory standards; it reportedly took four months for the firm to get approval for its license. Despite the wait, Garcia said:“Bermuda is known as a financial hub and it is very forward thinking on blockchain and fintech... They have a reputation of being excellent regulatory stewards and we thought that would be a better fit for us than a jurisdiction where we could say we’re good, they’d believe us and give us approval in three weeks.”Bermuda has been cultivating a friendly regulatory environment for fintech, crypto, and blockchain-related business over the course of the past year. In addition to the aforementioned regulations, the country also began to amend the Banking Act in order to establish a new class of bank to render services to local fintech and blockchain organizations.The government has also signed memoranda of understanding (MoUs) with several blockchain and crypto-related companies to both promote the industry in Bermuda and create jobs for the local population."

He wrote:“Under the powers afforded to me as arbitrator under article 6 of the Rules of Dispute Resolution, I, Ben Gates, rules that the EOS account in dispute should be returned to the claimant with immediate effect and that the freeze over the assets within the said account is removed.”EOS has frequently garnered criticism from cryptocurrency sources due to its alleged lack of decentralization, a characteristic which CTO Daniel Larimer himself confirmed in an interview last month.“Decentralization isn’t what we’re after,” he told YouTube series Colin Talks Crypto, adding:“What we’re after is anti-censorship and robustness against being shut down.”In June, EOS “froze” seven accounts that were suspected of having been compromised through phishing scams, with EOS Block Producers (BP) shortly after reportedly receiving a separate emergency order to stop the processing of transactions for 27 accounts with reasoning to follow.On Reddit, responses to the alleged transaction reversal centered around the concept that without decentralization, EOS had failed to prove its use case versus other more traditional centralized structures. The project’s $4 billion year-long Initial Coin Offering (ICO) was also highlighted.“Why would anyone use this over a bank account and traditional legal system?” the most popular comment reads, adding:“These guys raised ($4 billion) to recreate the legal system using a token that is neither censorship resistant, nor immutable.”"

According to OPEC’s website, the organization has not yet scheduled its agenda for 2019; the nearest meeting of the oil industry members will be held Dec. 6 in Vienna, Austria.Venezuela officially launched the sale of its widely discussed oil-backed cryptocurrency at the end of October. 11 months after country’s leader announced the national coin, Petro can now be purchased directly from its official website or from six local crypto exchanges authorized by the government. However, crypto wallets for trading the coin have reportedly been suspended by Google.As Cointelegraph has often reported, the Venezuelan government is actively promoting Petro. For instance, Maduro appealed to the county’s citizens in October, asking them to invest in gold and Petro while the national currency, the sovereign bolivar, is facing hyperinflation.The country’s president also stated that Petro would be used for international commercial transactions starting in October 2018. Moreover, Venezuela announced that the currency would be used as a unit of account within the country, making salaries and pricing systems tied to Petro.However, some experts, journalists, and economists are sceptical about Venezuela’s coin. A Reuter's report claimed that Petro was not backed by oil nor mined anywhere in the country. The news agency also cited former Oil Minister Rafael Ramirez who wrote that ""the petro [...] only exists in the government’s imagination.”Experts also told media outlet Wired that PDVSA, which reportedly backs Petro, had $45 billion in debt and showed no signs of any trading activity. The publication noted that this might mean the currency is only a ""smoke curtain"" to conceal Maduro's recent failure to reanimate the national fiat currency."

The size of the automotive digital advertising market was estimated at nearly $15 billion in the U.S. in 2018.Nancy Inouye, Media Director at Toyota Motor North America, reportedly told advertising trade publication AdAge that the campaign with Lucidity resulted in a 21 percent upstick in visits to Toyota’s website. As reported, Lucidity was able to flag sites and apps with a high level of impression and click discrepancy — which indicates fraud or bot infiltration — to move funds to sites with higher performance.Inouye reportedly said that Toyota ""wanted to go deeper into the programmatic space in particular because it is an area [where] quite frankly, we don't have transparency and visibility.” According to AdAge, the company now plans to extend its deal with Lucidity beyond the originally planned three-week test. Inouye added:""We are in discussions to take it to the next step and [test] further with additional campaigns for a longer period of time. We feel that if we go longer we would see stronger results.""Tom Scott, Media Director at Saatchi & Saatchi, stated that ""even with high standards of anti-fraud and viewability filters already built in, Lucidity was able to deliver significant value-add by further optimizing the campaign."" He added:""The ability to have access to a transparent, clean set of data from across the programmatic supply chain is game-changing. We're empowered to take action, and this is the first time we've been able to use blockchain technology to eliminate waste and optimize our ad buy in this way.""Blockchain has been actively deployed within the media industry to address transparency issues like fake traffic counts, bot clicks and domain spoofing, as well as audit ad transactions.

The “wholesale” variant of CBDC (W-CBDC) limits its use to financial institutions and markets, as opposed to a “retail CBDC” for the general public.The jointly compiled report looks into how to tackle the challenges and frictions in existing cross-border payment and interbank settlement systems, which currently rely on central banks operating the real-time gross settlement (RTGS) infrastructure within which commercial interbank obligations must settle.According to the report, there are five main drawbacks to the incumbent, cross-border payments  “correspondent banking” model. First, there are time lags for cross-jurisdictional payments, during which counterparties are exposed to credit and settlement risk from their correspondents.Lags also limit the effective deployment of commercial banks’ liquidity, as funds are tied up longer; other major challenges include a lack of transparency regarding payment status for end-users and banks, high operational costs, and the increasing vulnerability of RTGS systems to cyber-attacks and other threat factors.The report thus proposes and analyzes two remediary “legacy” approaches, and one approach that would involve the issuance of wholesale CBDCs, in three configurations.The first would be the issuance of jurisdiction specific W-CBDCs, which cannot be exchanged across borders; second, jurisdiction-specific W-CBDCs that can be exchanged across borders; and third, the issuance of a single, universally accepted W-CBDC.Of all the variants, jurisdiction-specific W-CBDCs were found to provide the fewest benefits, essentially representing a tokenized version of the existing, correspondent banking model.However, the other two W-CBDC versions would, according to the report, be poised to significantly improve counterparty credit and payment and settlement risks, as well as to widen access to RTGS infrastructure (i.e. to non-bank payment service providers).On the other hand, all forms of W-CDBCs were judged to “degrade” (i.e. perform worse than currently) existing governance frameworks, and to provide a mix of benefits and drawbacks for central banks’ future role and oversight.As previously reported, both the Central Bank of Canada and the Monetary Authority of Singapore have two major CBDC-related research initiatives underway, Project Jasper and UBIN respectively.Earlier this week, head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Christine Lagarde urged the international community to “consider” endorsing CBDCs, arguing they “could satisfy public policy goals,” specifically “financial inclusion.”"

Tiberius Group then explained that “instead of underlying the digital currency with only one commodity, we have chosen a mix of technology metals, stability metals and electric vehicle metals. This will give the coin diversification, making it more stable and attractive for investors.”Now, the Swiss firm will reportedly delay the launch of Tiberius Coin due to “unacceptably” high fees from credit card processing companies. Per Tiberius’ assessment, it will be unable to handle orders worth $15 million due to “restrictions” put on credit cards. Tiberius stated:“As of now, we are investing heavily in our platform, improving it and working with notable credit card processors to onboard new payment gateways for our client base to use. All investors who took part in the sale will have their money refunded within 30 days.”Credit card companies have previously shown some hesitation about working with cryptocurrency companies and digital asset trading. In June, San-Francisco-based bank Wells Fargo announced that it will no longer allow its customers to purchase cryptocurrency using its credit cards. The move was reportedly taken in order to avoid “multiple risks” associated with cryptocurrency usage.In February, Cointelegraph reported that customers at J.P.

Counterfeit electronics components are a global issue that requires an ecosystem-wide effort to address.”IBM continues to intensively pursue blockchain technology development, just last week filing a patent for a blockchain-powered system that aims to deter augmented reality (AR) game players from intruding on undesirable locations, thus helping to set and maintain safe boundaries between AR objects and real-world physical locations.As of Aug. 31, 2018, the tech giant ranked second worldwide in terms of the number of blockchain-related patents filed to date, second only to China’s Alibaba."

The exchange, dubbed IronX, is a regulated platform that has been jointly established by digital trading firm IronFX and EmurgoHK, developers of the ninth-largest crypto by market cap, Cardano (ADA).The platform says it “aims to “bring crypto trading to the mass retail trading market.”Hammond has served as MP for the constituency of Wimbledon in London since 2005, and reportedly worked in the financial markets for twenty years prior to starting his political career. He is quoted today as saying that, “we are all on a steep learning curve to understand this new asset class,” adding:“The only way cryptocurrencies will be trusted and become accepted in the traditional business environment is through regulation [...] This includes governments, policymakers, regulators and the financial services industry.

videos narrated by South East Asia CEO Matthew Driver, where he argued ...","Oct 18, 2018","On October 12, Finance Magnates reported that payment giants Mastercard and VISA will both soon group cryptocurrency and Initial Coin Offering (ICO) jurisdictions in a new “high risk” category.","According to the publication’s undisclosed sources, the ban will be applied to brokers who operate “from unregulated or loosely regulated environments,” and therefore have no license that would show that proper due diligence has been applied to their business. The action reportedly deals with forex, binary, cryptos, and ICOs.More specifically, the alleged move seems to target non-EU countries “in the Balkans, former Soviet Republics, and the Far East,” as Finance Magnates argues, while “EU-regulated brokers are suffering due to significant changes to their operations, stemming from the new regulatory framework.” Apparently, the publication referred to the regulations introduced by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) in June, when the regulator rolled out leverage limits for local retail brokers within the EU. The restrictions targeted cryptocurrencies, among others, as Steven Maijoor, the ESMA Chair, declared:“The new measures on CFDs will, for the first time, ensure that investors cannot lose more money than they put in, restrict the use of leverage and incentives, and provide understandable risk warnings for investors.”Thus, non-regulated brokers would reportedly be classified as “high-risk securities merchants” by VISA and Mastercard, brining similar limitations outside of the EU. Consequently, such transactions would be labeled with code 6211, meaning that chargebacks made by clients on those transactions can still be executed for up to 540 days.Allegedly, Finance Magnates’ sources stated that the new classification by Mastercard had started on October 15, while VISA was planning to implement a similar grouping in December of this year. Neither Mastercard nor VISA have commented on the matter as of press time.Moreover, the publication stated (without providing any specific examples) that “some” associated businesses had already reported to their customers that they will stop accepting credit cards, meaning that the clients of brokers that operate poorly regulated businesses will have to rely entirely on alternative payment options, like wire bank transfers.  There is no information that would confirm the authenticity of the Finance Magnates’ report, which is written rather loosely — there is no evidence to back up most of the claims made throughout the article. Cointelegraph has reached out to Mastercard representatives for further comment, but have yet to receive an answer.  Previously, in May, Finance Magnates reported similar news, announcing that Mastercard was going to single out binary options, CFDs, forex, cryptocurrencies, and ICOs as “high risk” businesses in a “well-coordinated campaign” that involved “several regulators and government agencies.” The write-up quoted a letter allegedly written by a “partner bank” (without mentioning its name), stating the following: “If the merchant is unable to obtain an updated license, we will cease processing applicable high-risk securities transactions from such merchant until provided with an updated license.”At the time, Finance Magnates wrote that Mastercard’s regulation was “effective from the 12th of Oct. 2018, which is 6 months since the payment processors have received the letter,” with the changes affecting “all transactions globally via Mastercard, Debit Mastercard, and Maestro.” Starting then, every payment processor processing the transactions of a high-risk securities merchant are supposed to show to Mastercard that adequate due diligence has been applied. There have been no official statement from Mastercard confirming or refuting this news.Either way, it seems logical that the largest credit players on the market want to put unregulated players under more scrutiny and dodge potential risks, as seems to be a general trend: many countries have at least announced their regulatory frameworks, while the US regulators seems to have extended their purview to fight scammers on the market. It is worth stressing that the alleged move by Mastercard and VISA won’t target compliant players.Mastercard’s relationship with crypto is rather complex: the company has been putting a lot of effort into studying blockchain and securing patents related to the technology, but has publicly expressed its anti-crypto stance. Thus, in October 2017, Mastercard CEO Ajaypal Banga argued that anonymous, not-state-issued cryptocurrencies are “junk” due to their high volatility and inability to operate as a medium of exchange. Previously, in 2014, Mastercard went as far as releasing anti-Bitcoin videos narrated by South East Asia CEO Matthew Driver, where he argued:  “If its an anonymous transaction, that sounds like a suspicious transaction, why does somebody need to be anonymous?”VISA, on the other hand, has also been cutting ties with cryptocurrencies while investing in blockchain startups. In January of this year, the company stopped supporting crypto debit cards via a partnership with debit card provider WaveCrest. As a result, cards including those issued by CryptoPay, Bitwala, TenX, Wirex, and others, were suspended, limiting people from paying for goods and services in crypto."

In June, Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) said that the regulator was keeping “a close watch” on crypto and ICOs, “intervening when appropriate.” Earlier this month, the SFC’s chairman told a local newspaper that the watchdog was planning to establish a legal framework for crypto assets."

The infrastructure provider is now reportedly working with fifteen of the world’s leading banks to test its new DLT-based restructuring of the warehouse.While participant banks in DTCC’s 2016 proof-of-concept (PoC) included Bank of America, Citi, Credit Suisse, and JPMorgan, today’s release only explicitly names U.K.-based Barclays alongside 14 unnamed others.According to the press release, the testing will entail using simulated use cases and trials of the interactions between systems, enterprises, and platforms from other major infrastructure providers such as MarkitSERV, in particular the latter’s new credit platform “TradeServ.”Lee Braine of the Chief Technology Office at Barclays has said the initiative from DTCC and its collaborators will bring “distributed ledger technology to life in a demonstrable way that will enhance efficiencies and lower costs and risks for the industry.”The release gives insight into the roles and technology provided by the project’s partners, outlining that a consortium comprised of IBM, Axoni, and R3 have “recoded the functionality” of the warehouse using DLT and cloud services over a period of 18 months.IBM is reportedly at the helm of the project, providing “program management, DLT expertise, and integration services”; enterprise-focused blockchain startup Axoni is providing DLT infrastructure and smart contract applications built on its AxCore blockchain protocol; and blockchain consortium R3 is acting as a “solution advisor.”DTCC’s release also indicates the gargantuan scale of the infrastructure provider’s footprint in the global financial industry: as of 2017, DTCC’s subsidiaries “processed securities transactions valued at more than U.S. $1.61 quadrillion,” and that its depository provides custodian and asset servicing solutions from “131 countries and territories valued at U.S. $57.4 trillion.”It further states that DTCC’s Global Trade Repository service maintains roughly 40 million open over-the counter (OTC) positions weekly, and processes over 1 billion communications monthly via its group of licensed trade repositories.As reported in October, a recent study led by DTCC found that distributed ledger technology (DLT) is scalable enough to support daily trade volumes of the U.S. equity market. The 19-week study, conducted in collaboration with Accenture and R3, purportedly proved that DLT is capable of supporting an entire trading day’s volume at peak rates, which can hit as high as 115,000,000 daily trades, or 6,300 trades per second for five continuous hours."

In contrast, OKEx — the now-second crypto exchange by daily trade volume — as well as Huobi Pro and CoinCheck are the riskiest crypto trading spots, the report says.Per the Next Web, Group-IB made its determinations with a newly developed assessment system that calculates insurance premiums to cover cryptocurrencies held by major exchanges.CryptoIns, which is supported by Swiss insurance broker ASPIS S, is now offering its insurance services to dozens of major crypto exchanges. The new insurance policy purportedly covers losses from “cyber-attacks on exchange software, theft, fraud and illegal actions of crypto exchange personnel.”The risk assessment for crypto exchanges takes into account factors such as technical security levels, the reliability of basic storage, passwords, as well as clients’ personal data. The framework also considers risk management, as well as Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) policies.Group-IB and CryptoIns have not released the precise metrics used when determining the security of an exchange, reportedly in the interests of maintaining confidentiality.The issue of security on exchanges becomes increasingly important for adoption as more institutional players enter the space. As Cointelegraph previously reported, 31 crypto exchanges have been hacked over the last eight years — with an estimated $1.3 billion stolen.Some crypto exchanges, like International Digital Currency Markets (IDCM) are using new technology like artificial intelligence (AI) to help its security efforts — and use technology which continuously monitors its network for suspicious activities."

The NSW state government is said to have given its official mandate for the Registry to shift to the new blockchain-based eConveyancing system by July.The NSW Land Registry Services maintains the system that defines the legal ownership of both public and private land across the state, according to the report. As of the start of the new financial year, according to ZDNet, all NSW property transactions will be required, under the government’s directive, to be stored digitally, eliminating the need for paper-based Certificates of Title.In an interview with ZDNet, Land Registry Services CEO Adam Bennett pointed to “blockchain … systems [that] are being implemented in land jurisdictions overseas,” where, he said, “they are already delivering significant benefits.” He added that NSW would be making a series of “targeted experiments” in order to test “selected use cases” for the technology.ChromaWay’s AP strategic advisor Nicholas Delaveris told ZDNet that a blockchain system offers “an incontrovertible chain of ownership,"" which can not only be more efficient than paper-based methods but provide “a more complete and comprehensive view of land rights, restrictions, and responsibilities” by increasing transparency and preventing data duplication.According to ZDNet, the NSW government has also implemented a distributed ledger system for digital driver’s licenses, which launched this September.As reported this spring, the Netherlands’ Land Registry is also expecting to integrate a blockchain solution into its system for national real estate data “within one to three years.”  In March of this year, Sweden’s land-ownership authority, the Lantmäteriet, said it was poised to conduct its first blockchain-based property transaction after two years of testing, having used ChromaWay’s private blockchain to register land and properties since July 2017."

According to the Star, out of the 2.48 million Kenyans employed in 2016 only 77,000, or 3.1 percent, earned over Sh100,000.The Star reports that blockchain technology will be used to ensure the proper distribution of housing to deserving participants in the program and address issues of graft from both legislators and beneficiaries.Per the report, the government hopes that the new technology will reestablish public trust in the government’s housing initiatives, following the National Youth Service scandal, in which 40 civil servants and 14 private sector officials were arrested for looting $78 million from the project's coffers.Speaking at the second urban dialogue on the affordable housing agenda with the World Bank in Nairobi, Housing and Urban development Principal Secretary Charles Hinga said:“Kenya will use blockchain technology to ensure the rightful owners live in government funded housing projects.”The project will reportedly be financed by the National Housing Fund under the Finance Act of 2018, to which Kenyans will contribute 1.5 percent of their salary that will be matched by their employers.This is not the first attempt to employ blockchain in Kenya on the governmental level. Recently, Kenyan Distributed Ledgers and Artificial Intelligence task force chairman Bitange Ndemo said that the government should consider tokenizing the economy to deal with “increasing” rates of corruption and uncertainties. This move, according to Ndemo, would have the government print less hard currency.In June, “decentralized liquidity network” Bancor in partnership with non-profit foundation Grassroots Economics launched a network of blockchain-based community currencies in Kenya aimed at combating poverty. The project seeks to stimulate local and regional commerce and peer-to-peer activity by enabling Kenyan communities to create and manage their own digital tokens.While blockchain- and token-based projects are being implemented in the country, the Central Bank of Kenya’s (CBK) is wary toward cryptocurrencies. In April, the CBK issued a circular to all banks in the country, warning them against dealing with crypto or engaging in transactions with crypto-related entities."

First, the world’s largest diamond company, Russia’s Alrosa, joined a blockchain project aimed at increasing transparency. Secondly, the world’s largest bank, JPMorgan, reportedly started to use its blockchain to tokenize gold.","Indeed, blockchain has been pioneering both gold and diamond industries — complex ecosystems that heavily rely on supply chains, where cargo passes through dozens of geographical locations before arriving at its destination. The technology has helped to avoid corruption and improve quality by tracking valuable assets at every milestone of their journey, from mine to retailer.On October 19, the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA), a wholesale over-the-counter market for the trading of gold and silver, announced its plan to modernise and improve transparency in the industry — with the help of blockchain.The technology could help excluding metal that is “illegally mined or traded or used to finance conflict” from the global supply chain. Indeed, that seems to be an industry-wide problem: for instance, in March 2017, FBI accused three employees of NTR Metals of importing $3.6 billion worth of gold from South American countries, refining, selling it, and then sending the earnings back to “drug traffickers.”Thus, as per Reuters, in March 2018, the LBMA asked its 144 members, including the world’s largest gold refiners, banks and dealers, for proposals on how to track gold from mines to its final destination and prevent forgery of gold bars.The association received 26 proposals “from companies ranging from startups to major technology firms” in return, LBMA’s executive board director Sakhila Mirza told Reuters, without mentioning any particular names apart from IBM.  While the association did not insist on using blockchain, “more than 20 of the 26 responses” reportedly embraced the technology in their project drafts.Now, the LBMA plans to outline guidelines to approve and monitor technology providers, Mirza added:“We need to set up criteria and standards that help us understand what is a credible blockchain solution [...] Once those have been appropriately established, the result would be a selection of service providers that meet the minimum standards.”According to the LBMA’s executive board director, a draft of the standards for tracking systems will be discussed in the first half of 2019.On October 29, Financial Review reported that JPMorgan, the most valuable bank by market capitalization in the world, has been using its enterprise version of the Ethereum blockchain that supports the use of smart contracts – called Quorum – to tokenize gold bars.Quorum was first announced in October 2016 as part of Ethereum Enterprise Alliance (EEA). The US bank presented a blockchain-powered system that aims to ""significantly reduce"" the number of parties required to verify global payments, cutting transaction times ""from weeks to hours."" The move came just a month after JPMorgan’s CEO Jamie Dimon famously called Bitcoin “a fraud” that “won’t end well,” a comment he most recently completed by saying he doesn’t “give a sh*t” about the cryptocurrency while adding that “blockchain is real.”According to the Financial Review, JP Morgan mentioned the idea of “tokenizing” assets at the Sibos conference held in Sydney on October 22-25. JPMorgan's head of blockchain initiatives, Umar Farooq, elaborated on the concept:""They wrap a gold bar into a tamper-proof case electronically tagged, and they can track the gold bar from the mine to end point – with the use case being, if you know it's a socially responsible mine, someone will be willing to pay a higher spread on that gold versus if you don't know where it comes from. Diamonds is another example.”“Tokenization” thus implies tagging physical assets, and monitoring them on distributed ledgers such as Quorum, the company’s private blockchain. The concept not only promises extra security granted by blockchain solutions, but could also reduce risks and eliminate middlemen — like brokers and exchanges — from the trading process.A somewhat similar solution was introduced by the US-based Emergent Technology Holdings in February 2018, when the fintech company announced its “Responsible Gold” supply chain along with “G-coin,” a digital token allegedly backed by “responsibly sourced gold.”As per the press release, “Responsible Gold” supply chain is a permissioned blockchain that tracks responsibly sourced gold “from mine, to refinery, to vault.” It aims to provide “100 percent assurance on the provenance of gold"" by digitally recording each stage of the supply chain with the help from “cryptographic seals” attached to the gold.In an interview with CNBC, Emergent's chief commercial officer, Mitchell Davis, argued that the company’s approach was ""fundamentally different"" from others projects, partly because of its focus on ""responsibly sourced gold.""“G-coin,” in turn, is reportedly created in conjunction with NYSE-listed Canadian mining company called Yamana Gold. One coin is allegedly equivalent to one gram of “responsibly sourced gold,” and is pegged to the spot price of gold.The history of blockchain in the diamond industry could be traced back to May 2015, when Australian entrepreneur Leanne Kemp founded Everledger — a global digital registry for diamonds powered by distributed ledger technology (DLT). One of its main goals was to tackle the problem of “blood diamonds” — minerals extracted in war zones and sold to finance oppressive regimes.An immutable ledger would allow access to the full account of a particular diamond’s history and eliminate the possibility of forging documents, as every milestone of the gem’s destination would be recorded.In January 2018, De Beers Group, a large international corporation that specializes in diamond exploration, mining, and retail, introduced a similar initiative, although on a larger, commercial scale. The company announced it was looking into blockchain to improve the transparency of the diamond value chain and get permanent digital records for every diamond registered on the platform.De Beers added that an initial proof of concept trial was successful and resulted in a working prototype. The company’s CEO Bruce Cleaver said in a press release:“Diamonds hold enduring value and represent some of life’s most meaningful moments, so it’s essential to provide assurance that a diamond is conflict-free and natural. By leveraging blockchain technology, we will provide an additional layer of assurance to consumers and industry participants, with every diamond registered on the platform having a record as everlasting as the diamond itself.”A week after De Beer’s announcement, Impact, a Canadian NGO, left the Kimberley Process initiative (the process established in 2000 to prevent ""blood diamonds"" from entering the mainstream diamond market), arguing that the global agreement has not lived up to its goals. The move highlighted the urgency of the problem within the industry.On May 10, De Beers claimed that it tracked 100 high-value diamonds from the mine to the retailer using blockchain. According to the press release, this was the “first time a diamond’s journey has been digitally tracked from mine to retail.”De Beers also announced the launch of its blockchain initiative dubbed Tracr. Reportedly “open to the entire diamond industry,” the platform was developed collaboratively with five leading diamond manufacturers: Diacore, Diarough, KGK Group, Rosy Blue NV, and Venus Jewel.Tracr assigns a unique “Global Diamond ID” which records individual diamond characteristics such as carat, clarity, and color. The data is then recorded onto an immutable digital ledger. After that, Tracr verifies the data at each milestone of the diamond’s destination.The company’s move attempted to improve consumer confidence and public trust that their diamonds were non-conflict, in addition to increasing efficiency in the supply chain, as it was designed to complement existing regulations and schemes within the industry: the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme, World Diamond Council System of Warranties, and Responsible Jewellery Council Code of Practices.CEO of De Beers Group Bruce Cleaver stressed the importance of the initiative for the industry:“The Tracr project team has demonstrated that it can successfully track a diamond through the value chain, providing asset-traceability assurance in a way that was not possible before. This is a significant breakthrough made achievable by the close engagement of the pilot participants who share our commitment to industry progress and innovation.”On October 29, major Russian diamond mining firm Alrosa joined the Tracr project, further escalating its potential for the industry. Alrosa is reported to be the world’s largest producer of raw diamonds in carat terms; together with De Beers, the two firms produce around half of the world’s supply.As Alrosa CEO Sergey Ivanov told Mining Weekly, the company’s move was motivated by a belief that industry collaboration is essential for the sake of “a common goal.”In late April, a consortium of jewelry industry leaders announced TrustChain initiative in collaboration with with IBM, who developed a blockchain network for tracing the origin of finished pieces of jewelry.The TrustChain Initiative include precious metals refiner Asahi Refining, jewelry retailer Helzberg Diamonds, precious metals supplier LeachGarner, jewelry manufacturer the Richline Group, and independent verification service UL.Based on the IBM Blockchain Platform and the Hyperledger Project, the initiative is designed to track and authenticate diamonds and precious metals from their place of origin to their retail location. It provides “digital verification, physical product and process verification, and third-party oversight,” aiming to assure customers that their jewelry purchases are ethically sourced.By applying the technology, the consortium of the companies intends to digitize processes, establish a shared, immutable record of transactions within the network, and enable access to trusted data in real time. Mark Hanna, Richline Group’s Chief Marketing Officer, commented on the initiative:“TrustChain is the first blockchain of its kind within our industry, designed as a solution that marries IBM’s leading blockchain technology with responsible sourcing, verification and governance by third party organizations, led by UL as the administrator.”According to the announcement, the product will be available to consumers by the end of 2018.In May 2018, blockchain startup D1 Mint Limited, the creator of the diamond-backed crypto asset D1 Coin, announced it was working with two leading diamond industry players to tokenize gems.Thus, D1 Mint Limited signed an agreement to buy 1,500 investment-grade diamonds, worth $20 million, from global veteran KGK Diamonds. The raw diamonds were supplied by Alrosa.D1 employs a pricing algorithm to establish the price at which crypto investors can redeem their tokens for selected diamonds from their diamond reserve at any given time, using the technology to translate traditional industry parameters of value — namely diamond’s shape, carat, cut and clarity.While the diamond industry has seen stagnating demand among retailers, with spending on diamond jewelry staying flat at around $80 billion a year since 2014, as per a De Beers study, Alexei Chekunkov, a member of Alrosa’s Board of Directors, stays optimistic — his company believes that the innovation of blockchain can transform the precious gem industry by making natural diamonds an investment asset class with wider appeal across “various investor groups, driving higher demand.”"
