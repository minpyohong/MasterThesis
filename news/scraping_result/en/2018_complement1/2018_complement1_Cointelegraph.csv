predicted that the Bitcoin price has nearly hit its bottom.","Oct 6, 2018","Spencer Bogart, an expert from digital currency and blockchain venture firm Blockchain Capital has said that the Bitcoin (BTC) price has nearly found its bottom, CNBC reported Oct. 5.","Speaking on CNBC’s “Fast Money,” Bogart asserted that “we're down about 70 percent from our highs, so I think that Bitcoin is close to bottoming and so is the rest of the market.” Bogart added that the news flow regarding the cryptocurrency industry “is a piece of kindling that we are going to throw onto a future crypto bonfire when we have the next bull market."" Bogart said:“Towards the end of last year, when we were in the peak of this bull market, bad news seemed to have no effect on the markets [...] Now we are seeing the other side of that, when we have a week of news with TD [Ameritrade], Ric Edelman and Yale, and it has almost no effect on price.”Bogart’s prediction about the BTC price bottom follows similar sentiment from major market players like the founder of crypto investment firm Galaxy Capital Management, Mike Novogratz. Novogratz said that digital currency prices hit a bottom in a tweet last month. Speaking at the Beyond Blocks conference in South Korea in July, Novogratz also predicted that many institutions will enter the crypto industry “in the next two to three years.”Earlier this week, Cointelegraph reported that 54 percent of institutional players think that the BTC price has already bottomed, having hit its lowest price point this year. Institutional players are also bullish in regards to the potential future growth of BTC. 57 percent of respondents in the survey said that BTC price is going to reach anywhere from $15,000 to “the moon” by the end of 2019.In July, Fundstrat’s Tom Lee reiterated his bullish position regarding BTC, claiming that the leading cryptocurrency could trade between $22,000 and $25,000 by the year’s end. Later in August, Lee predicted that BTC “could end the year explosively higher,” citing a correlation between it and emerging markets.Recently, BTC has seen insignificant price change, which is reflected with only two subsequent price corrections since trading above $6,600 at the beginning of its weekly chart. At press time, BTC is trading at around $6,606, up less than one percent in the last 24 hours."

biggest block, it had about 1,400 fewer transactions than the average ...","Sep 26, 2018","From soft and hard forks to protocol upgrades, to the implementation of Segwit and to the future outlook of the Lightning Network (LN), the Bitcoin network has come a long way since its inception in January 2009. As of Sept. 18, 2018, the average block size on the Bitcoin network is .8MB and the average number of transactions per block is 1609 — so a few eyebrows were raised when a block over 2MB was added to the blockchain on Sept. 5, 2018.","Bitcoin block 540107 came in at 2.26MB; in terms of megabytes, a block this big has never been added to the blockchain before. Although the bear market has been going on for nine months, block 540107 could be a sign that the Bitcoin network is progressing technologically. To understand why, let’s first have a look at the current state of the Bitcoin network.Currently on the Bitcoin network, the average block size is 0.804MB and there are an average of 1609 transactions per block — that is why a block like 540107, which is 2.26MB big but only has 230 transactions included in it, is such an anomaly.Block 540107 is the largest block on the Bitcoin network to date due in large part to Segwit, a soft fork in the Bitcoin network. This update in the code allowed transaction signature data to be stored in an extended block, a storage unit not necessarily attached to a ‘regular’ block.An extended block holds the transaction signature data — which is normally packed into a regular block in a non-Segwit transaction — in a location separate from the block with the transaction data. When Segwit was activated on Aug. 24, 2017, it replaced the non-Segwit 1MB block size limit with a 4MB maximum block weight. This allowed more transaction data to be packed into a single block because transaction signature data is removed and stored in a separate location — i.e., extended blocks. Because of this, Segwit made it possible for blocks to be over 2MB in size. If a block was filled with only witness (signature) data, then a block could technically be 4MB in size. Therefore, Segwit paved the way for block 540107 to be the largest block to date in terms of size (2.26MB).But although block 540107 was the largest to date in terms of megabytes, it only had 230 transactions included in it, which is about 86 percent (1379, to be exact) fewer transactions than the average block on the Bitcoin networkThis isn’t the first time a big block had far fewer transactions than an average block on the Bitcoin network. Jan. 20, 2018, was the first time the Bitcoin network saw a block that was over 2MB, when block 505225 came in at 2.17MB, and similar to block 540107, the block had a relatively low number of transactions compared to an average block on the Bitcoin network. Block 505225 only contained 225 transactions — about 15 percent of the usual amount of transactions in a block.Although the low number of transactions in such big blocks could seem unusual, an independent crypto-researcher that goes by AltcoinXP-Anthony believes that we should be less concerned about the number of transactions in a block and more concerned about if the weight of the block is close to or at capacity. Commenting on why the block only had 230 transactions, he told Cointelegraph:“You would have to ask the miner that mined it — they make that decision. But my guess would be that that is how many [transactions] filled the block [weight] limit. number of transactions doesn't mean much. You can have one transaction which sends thousands of pieces of BTC dust (little amounts of BTC spread between many addresses) sent to a single address. The dust takes up more block real estate [...] more data being needed per transaction [...] So what I mean to say is that not all transactions [are equal], some have a larger weight/size due to the amount of inputs [or outputs] there are.”With the Segwit soft-fork, a new addition to the technical parameter came called ‘weight.’ Before Segwit, 1MB of data on the Bitcoin network was technically equal to 4 million weight units — or in other words, the entire weight capacity of a block. But with Segwit, each byte only weighs one weight unit, which allows more data to be packed in a block and which is why we can have blocks that are larger than one and two megabytes.Thus, one transaction can send thousands of ‘BTC dust’ — i.e., transactions on the Bitcoin network that can be consolidated, aka batched. Batching is when several transactions on the Bitcoin network are compressed into one transaction (input) with several outputs, instead of having separate transactions with unique inputs and outputs. Batching transactions reduce the amount of data that is required to deliver different transactions to different addresses; however, the more transactions that are batched together, the larger the byte size of the transaction.Bitcoin researcher David A. Harding provides a great example of batching in his article,“Let’s imagine one Bitcoin equals one dollar. Alice receives the bill for 10 BTC and starts a transaction by adding a 20 BTC input from her wallet. Then she adds two outputs: a 10 BTC output that goes to Bob and another 10 BTC output that returns the change to her own wallet.”In this case, the total size of this transaction would be 226 bytes because the code required to execute one transaction on the Bitcoin network takes up 226 bytes of data. But the story example continues:“But wait, Alice almost forgot to tip for the excellent service she received. With physical cash, Alice would make a second transaction by taking the $10 she received in change, trading it for some small denomination money, and leaving a 15 percent tip of $1.50 on the table, keeping the other $8.50 in change for herself.”  But on the Bitcoin network, Alice would need to create a new transaction for the tip, and the size of this transaction would be 226 bytes too. For Alice to pay for her meal and leave a tip, her objective requires the Bitcoin network to add a total of 452 bytes to a block if it is done in two separate transactions.However, there is a way to consolidate these separate transactions into one.With physical cash, Alice could pay her original bill by handing the cashier $20 and telling him to deduct the tip before giving her back $8.50 in change  —  keeping the rest ($1.50, or 15 percent) as the tip. On the Bitcoin network, we can also consolidate the number of transactions that take place by adding an additional output to the original transaction. According to Harding, each additional output consumes 34 bytes. So when Alice batches a transaction to pay for her food (output #1) and tip (output #2), the Bitcoin network will require 260 bytes total for her to complete her objective — opposed to the 452 it requires if Alice proceeds in two separate transactions. Similar to Segwit, the idea behind batching is to free up block space so that more data — and hopefully transactions — can fit into a block.Although batching drastically reduces the amount of data required to make several transactions at once, each new output added to the batched transaction is going to require the Bitcoin network to consume more data to complete the transaction. Although this amount of data isn’t nearly as high as it would be if a user were making transactions with several different inputs and outputs, it can still add up.Although there were only 230 transactions in the block, it is possible that a number of those transactions were batched, so that one input had a large number of outputs; this would require the Bitcoin network to consume a larger amount of bytes to make the transaction possible — depending on how many outputs were attached to each input. But regardless of the number of transactions that were included in block 540107, a block over 2MB is a good news.Although the cryptocurrency markets have been going through a rough patch for nearly nine months now, block 540107 could be proof that progress is being made in regard to solving Bitcoin’s scalability problem. For those who preach that Bitcoin is going to be the money of the future, such a development could usher in that future — one in which transactions would not take between seven or eight transactions per second to process. Major payment processors can handle tens of thousands of transactions per second, such as Visa, which can process 24,000 transactions per second. If we want to see Bitcoin be adopted and used as a payment method in society, the amount of transactions the network can handle is an issue that needs to be tackled.Some are hopeful that the Lightning Network will play a significant role in solving the scalability problem, and although the Lightning Network does not need Segwit to exist, the implementation of Segwit prevents malleated transactions from occuring in Lightning channels. Although we may be a bit of a ways away from Lightning Network implementation, block 540107 seems to indicate that the Bitcoin network is moving in the direction it needs to move in for Lightning Network as well as other possible scaling solutions to come to fruition."

announced a release of an update to fix a DDoS attack vulnerability. The 
most ...","Sep 27, 2018","Software vulnerabilities continue to be a red flag issue in crypto community. Not long ago, the top-five cryptocurrency EOS network experienced a vulnerability right in the dawn of its development. The same thing happened to Ethereum, when a series of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks led to a significant delay in the operation of the nodes. And the news about another bug in the code came out yesterday, with the announcement made by Monero developers to patch the vulnerability, which allowed attackers to burn funds. It could seem that such kind of bug can affect any crypto, but not Bitcoin. But what could be worse than the vulnerability of a coin with a daily turnover of $4.5 billion? Perhaps, only ignorance about the existing threat. The recent Bitcoin Core vulnerability is a clear case in point.","On Sept. 18, Bitcoin Core developers announced a release of an update to fix a DDoS attack vulnerability. The most shocking discovery was that such an attack could be succeeded by flooding the full node operators with traffic, or by sending them information that could trigger a network crash.The fix CVE-2018-1744 was initially addressed to several developers who were working on both Bitcoin Core and other cryptocurrency-based projects. The bug was identified by Bitcoin Cash developer Awemany, who concludes in his Medium post that CVE-2018-17144 is “the most catastrophic bug in recent years, and certainly one of the most catastrophic bugs in Bitcoin ever.” Awemany publicly expressed his feedback without hesitating to call Bitcoin Core’s most prominent developer arrogant. The vulnerability is being tracked in the CVE-2018-17144 advisory, which includes the following description:“Bitcoin Core 0.14.x before 0.14.3, 0.15.x before 0.15.2, and 0.16.x before 0.16.3 and Bitcoin Knots 0.14.x through 0.16.x before 0.16.3 allow a remote denial of service (application crash) exploitable by miners via duplicate input. An attacker can make bitcoind or Bitcoin-Qt crash.”However, the vulnerability was much more serious, as it could have allowed malicious miners to artificially inflate Bitcoin’s supply via a simple type of double input.In simple terms, the recent event is related to the consensus code. Miners could crash blocks in case they tried to validate a block containing a transaction that attempts to spend the same input twice, causing the whole Bitcoin infrastructure to crash. Furthermore, providing that those invalid blocks need to be mined anyway, malicious miners willing to disregard block reward of 12.5 BTC (approximately $80,000) could even lead to destruction of the whole ecosystem.Perhaps, because of the possible catastrophic consequences of the error, the developers decided to keep it a secret, having won the time to fix it and invited both miners and users to update their software aimed at eliminating possible crash.In the report made two days later, the developers explained that the team made every appropriate action in order to encourage immediate software upgrades, including building awareness for the concerned actors, while delaying publication of the full issue’s disclosure to gain time for systems to upgrade.According to the statement, the patched vulnerability existed in the Bitcoin Core software without repairment since version 0.14, while version 0.15 introduced the inflation vulnerability.Nevertheless, Bitcoin Core developers decided to disclose the full extent of the vulnerability after a majority of the BTC hash rate upgraded to the patched software, while full node operators who have not been complied with the guidance should do so as soon as possible.Bitcoin’s Core statement resumed:“At this time, we believe over half of the Bitcoin hash rate has upgraded to patched nodes. We are unaware of any attempts to exploit this vulnerability. However, it still remains critical that affected users upgrade and apply the latest patches to ensure no possibility of large reorganizations, mining of invalid blocks or acceptance of invalid transactions occurs.”Among the catalysts to help resolve this critical bug was Bitcoin Core developer Cory Fields, who identified one of the most critical vulnerabilities of Bitcoin Cash earlier this year, which could have been so disruptive that transacting Bitcoin Cash safely would no longer be possible, completely undermining the utility (and thus, the value) of the currency itself, as Cory argues here.The Bitcoin Core development team has been heavily criticized by Bitcoin holders for the manner in which they rolled out the ‘hot’ announcement regarding the bug and the patch.Indeed, their decision to publish the announcement without consulting members of the altcoin networks has disappointed many industry enthusiasts and contributors.Among those who have expressed public criticism was the self-named Bitcoin Core’s ‘Secret Agent’ John Carvalho who described in a series of tweets how Bitcoin Core’s team was making decisions when the doors were closed.I was a paying member of the original Bitcoin Foundation. They were mostly a train wreck. I attended their annual meeting at a conference in Amsterdam and met with their accounting person to ask some hard questions. She was actually pretty savvy. /1The event was another opportunity for ‘crypto Twitter’ and especially the enthusiasts of Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash to argue. Let’s not forget about plenty of Bitcoin users who have been thankful and have shown appreciation for the hard work of developers to keep Bitcoin’s network safe, without being remunerated and provide their services mostly on a volunteer basis.Despite the fact that the bug has been fixed, the question remains: What would have happened if the error had not been detected in time? In particular, some users wondered whether somebody managed to exploit this vulnerability to produce “a bunch of fake Bitcoins.” One of them even discovered that 0.1 BTC was generated in the Bitcoin Testnet as a result of such misuse.The answers to these questions, along with words of reassurance, have been given by Bitcoin Core team in their latest update:“Stored funds are not at risk, and never were at risk. Even if the bug had been exploited to its full extent, the theoretical damage to stored funds would have been rolled back, exactly as it was in the value overflow incident. However, there is currently a small risk of a chain split. In a chain split, transactions could be reversed long after they are fully confirmed. Therefore, for the next week or so you should consider there to be a small possibility of any transaction with less than 200 confirmations being reversed.”Another Bitcoin developer, Pieter Wuille, assured that “if this bug would have been exploited already, it would be noticed by any such new node.”Full nodes validate all of history to protect against this sort of issue.If you start a new full node from scratch, it first downloads the whole historical blockchain, and verifies it. If this bug would have been exploited already, it would be noticed by any such new node.Later, he added that in case such a bug had been exploited by someone after the update release, “all 0.14.0 version nodes would crash and everyone who upgraded would see warnings about not being on majority chain.”Well, while all this may sound convincing, one more essential question still remains: What if not all the users managed to patch the upgraded version? More fuel to the fire has been added by CobraBitcoin, lead back-end developer at Openbazaar, who suggested that “80 percent of the network is [still] running vulnerable software.”Bad move that the alert system was removed from Bitcoin Core. Currently 80%+ of the network is running vulnerable software, but there's no way to reach them and tell them to update, we can only pray they check Reddit, Twitter, https://t.co/OsFgRFRRZb or Bitcointalk, etc.The percentage of this network is minimal, according to Emin Gün Sirer’s statement, with a major patch corresponding to economically worthless nodes. If they affected something useful, someone would have bothered to upgrade them.Bitcoin’s vision of decentralization and transparency seems to be minimized when looking closely the CVR-2018-1744 episode, indicating that major decisions are being taken by a small minority of members of the community. Therefore, the fear of a major loss of billions of dollars, in case of a different decision, seems to be obvious.The probability of crashing the entire system was high in this saga, as the bug has been variously described as “very scary,” “major,” “catastrophic,” and one of the “top three of four” most severe bugs ever found in Bitcoin’s code."

The number of units symbolises the fact that the number of bitcoins will never exceed 21 million.To promote and sell the model, Hublot has partnered with Octagon Strategy Limited (OSL) –  a major Asian digital asset brokerage which will help process customer data during the pre-sale.To purchase a Big Bang Blockchain, a customer has to register on a dedicated website. OSL will then confirm the data and send the payment details via email. The new Hublot model will be delivered to its buyers in the beginning of 2019.The elite Swiss brand has also paid a tribute to blockchain technology, calling it ""a revolution in the financial system"". Hublot further explained the importance of decentralization:""By allowing digital information to be distributed, Blockchain technology creates the backbone of a new type of Internet. Well-recognised for its originality, the technology is regarded as one of the most powerful and fastest-growing trading tools, not to mention unlimited possibility of usage in different aspects that will revolutionise various industry norms and trade.""The Swiss brand is not the only one to commemorate Bitcoin's upcoming anniversary.

feverishly trying to trace Bitcoin's circulation, as well as that of other 
digital ...","Oct 7, 2018","Much noise has been made about the untraceable qualities of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin ""can be used to buy merchandise anonymously"" said early primers on crypto, it offers users the kind of financial privacy that was previously available only from a ""Swiss bank account,"" say more recent commentators. And given its ability to provide people with a layer of anonymity and privacy, it has been smeared by politicians, experts and mainstream journalists alike as a hiding place for almost any hacker, drug dealer, gang member, terrorist or despot you could possibly name (even if cash is still the preferred financial medium of such personae non gratae).","It's therefore no wonder that, for several years, governments have been feverishly trying to trace Bitcoin's circulation, as well as that of other digital currencies. And despite the popular reputation of most cryptocurrencies as anonymous, they've been aided in this pursuit by the fact that most cryptos are not anonymous, but rather pseudonymous. In other words, by linking transactions to fixed wallet addresses, and by keeping a public record of every single transaction ever made on their chains, most popular cryptocurrencies provide national governments with an almost perfect means of keeping tabs on our financial activity.However, while many governments have begun capitalizing on this very convenient affordance by building systems that compile transaction data and scraped private info into a single database, most have only just begun moving in this direction. And more importantly, there are a number of privacy coins – Monero being the most prominent  – that don't offer a public record linking transactions to wallets, while there are also mixing tools for making the transactions of non-privacy coins private. As such, there are still ways to remain anonymous in crypto for those who want to keep a low profile, despite the best efforts of governments in the US, Russia, Japan, and elsewhere.As the most recent example of government crypto monitoring, the Japanese National Police Agency (NPA) announced plans to implement a system that can reportedly ""track"" cryptocurrency transactions within Japan. While specific technical details are scarce, the software is being developed by an unnamed private company and will cost the NPA around $315,000 next year to run. In particular, its main function will be to trace transactions reported to it as 'suspicious', linking them together into a visualization that will, in theory, enable it to pinpoint the sources and destinations of illicit money.For the most part, it will receive its reports of suspicious activity from Japanese crypto-exchanges, which ever since the May introduction (by the Financial Services Agency) of anti-money laundering (AML) legislation have been sending it intelligence on potentially illegal transactions and the accounts associated with them. Indeed, this reporting is precisely what makes a 'transaction-tracking system' possible, rather than the invention of some novel cryptographic technology capable of breaking through the pseudonymity/anonymity of most cryptocurrencies. Simply, exchanges are being legally required to follow strict know-your-customer (KYC) policies, which enable them to link real-world identities to addresses and to transactions recorded on public blockchains. And given that they're supplying this info to the NPA, all the NPA will really be doing with their system is feeding such info into a database and creating visualizations of the flow of crypto.What this means is that such a system isn't likely to have much direct application to anyone who circumvents (regulated) exchanges when receiving and sending crypto. That said, even if certain users stay away from Japanese exchanges they could still be linked to illicit crypto if said crypto has passed through an exchange and already raised suspicions. Either way, another area to which the system isn't likely to have much direct application are privacy-enabling coins such as Monero, Zcash and Dash, since rather than attempting to track such coins the Japanese authorities have merely decided to ban exchanges from carrying them.A similar story is currently emerging in Russia, where the Federal Financial Monitoring Service (Rosfinmonitoring) has contracted for a system that will collate various sources of information regarding suspects in finance-related crimes. As reported by the BBC Russia service, the system will be used to create profiles for suspects, to which the authorities then add whatever relevant info they can gleam about him or her: phone numbers, bank card details, physical addresses, and crypto wallet addresses. Once again, the system hasn't been designed specifically to compromise the cryptography of Bitcoin or any other crypto, but rather seeks to simply add wallet information – where available – to any other data Rosfinmonitoring has on a suspect.By doing this, the Russian authorities clearly hope to prevent suspects from laundering any illicitly gained money via crypto, while they also assert that they intend to stop crypto being used directly for illegal purposes. ""Because of their anonymity and the inability to trace them,"" German Klimenko – an ex-advisor to Vladimir Putin on internet development (and head of the cryptocurrency group at the Russian Chamber of Commerce and Industry) – told the BBC. ""Cryptocurrency is used in grey areas, in the dark web, for buying weapons, drugs, or violent videos. Lawmakers of many countries are wary of this phenomenon: this was confirmed by the analysis that we conducted under orders from the president [Putin].""While Russia hasn't introduced regulations requiring exchanges to uphold strict AML and KYC policies, the State Duma is in the process of negotiating a digital assets bill that would do just that. And once this bill has passed, Russian authorities will – like their Japanese counterparts – have access to info on the identities of wallet holders. As a result, the Rosfinmonitoring service will be able to enter this information in the soon-to-be-launched system (coming at the end of 2018), which will enable it to link transactions, wallets, and identities together.But because this system will be tapping into crypto-exchange records rather than novel 'crypto-hacking' technology, it's likely that it won't apply to all cryptocurrencies and all cryptocurrency users. Some experts even believe that it will have a largely counterproductive effect, forcing many cryptocurrencies and their users to become more untraceable.""If you look at the entire volume of laundered funds, the share that is laundered through cryptocurrency is very small,"" Anton Merkurov – an advisor with US-based the Free Russia Foundation – said. ""Let's say the turnover of the local exchange is about one billion rubles [around $14.7 million] a week. This, in fact, is not very much. Instead of catching the proverbial Colonel Zakharchenko [a former anti-corruption officer who was caught with around $140 million in bribe money in 2016], authorities are trying to find a microbe under a microscope in a drop of water. This should not be a priority. And most importantly, start pressing there and opposition will begin, you will think up real tools for laundering.""While the systems being rolled out by Japan and Russia largely depend on cooperation from crypto-exchanges and on piecing together disparate sources of information, there are indications that some governments at least have taken a more direct approach to identifying crypto users.The US, to take the most notable – and disconcerting – example, has developed a covert piece of technology that can actually extract raw internet data from fiber-optic cables in order to identify the IP addresses and IDs of those sending and receiving Bitcoin. According to documents obtained by whistleblower Edward Snowden in 2013 and published by the Intercept in March 2018, the technology in question is a program developed by the National Security Agency (NSA) and known as OAKSTAR. Masquerading as a piece of virtual private network (VPN) and downloaded by some 16,000 users in such nations as China and Iran, the program instead siphons data from an ""unspecified ‘foreign’ fiber cable site,"" according to the Intercept.Using this data, the NSA can then extract such information from Bitcoin users as their password information, their internet browsing activity, and their MAC address, while certain whistle-blown docs also discuss extracting users’ internet addresses, timestamps, and network ports. Effectively, OAKSTAR can be used to gather much more than the information necessary to identify someone and link them to specific Bitcoin addresses and transactions, and it can do so without having to rely on crypto-exchanges.This is a big blow for Bitcoin privacy. As Cornell University professor Emin Gün Sirer told the Intercept:""People who are privacy conscious will switch to privacy-oriented coins […] when the adversary model involves the NSA, the pseudonymity disappears. You should really lower your expectations of privacy on this network.""Similarly, Matthew Green – an assistant prof. at Johns Hopkins University Information Security Institute (and a key Zcash developer) – explained to the Intercept that the NSA's exploits are ""bad news for privacy, because it means that in addition to the really hard problem of making [crypto] transactions private […] you also have to make sure all the network connections [are private].""As alarming as OAKSTAR and the activity surrounding it are, no new information has emerged recently to indicate that the NSA has extended its Bitcoin-tracking endeavors to other cryptocurrencies. There's also the fact that its ability to link certain people with Bitcoin wallets is predicated on these people unwittingly downloading a piece of software that secretly extracts their internet data (while purporting to provide some other service). As a result, if users stick to VPN packages (and other pieces of software) they know and trust, it's likely they will avoid the NSA's long claws.This reassurance aside, there is still the predictable reality that the United States government has been seeking user data from cryptocurrency exchanges, and has been doing so for longer than either the Japanese or Russian governments. In November 2016, for instance, it filed a legal summons that required Coinbase to provide the Inland Revenue Service (IRS) with the identities of an unspecified number of individuals associated with a number of cryptocurrency wallets. As Cointelegraph reported at the time, this summons was significant not so much in itself, but because it indicated that the IRS had been able to track certain wallets to an extent sufficient to determine that they'd been involved in the violation of tax legislation. Similarly, it also indicated that the IRS had been able to determine that the wallets were attached to Coinbase.While the IRS unsurprisingly hasn't divulged how it was able to track these wallets, a 2015 document leaked to the Daily Beast in 2017 revealed that it awarded a contract to Chainalysis, a Switzerland-based ""blockchain intelligence"" provider that monitors cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin for compliance reasons. As Cointelegraph reported at the time, Chainalysis uses ""data scraped from public forums, leaked data sources including dark web, exchange deposits and withdrawals to tag and identify transactions."" It attempts to combine what's made publicly available on blockchains with personal info unthinkingly/carelessly left by crypto users on the web. It runs, therefore, another system that is less about cryptographically penetrating blockchains and more about simply putting together all the disparate threads of info strewn across the Internet.And even though the IRS hasn't explicitly acknowledged its employment of Chainalysis or any other service, it's also interesting to note that past instances where an agency of the federal US government has succeeded in tracking crypto users have potentially involved input from the NSA. In October 2013, Ross Ulbricht was arrested by FBI agents in San Francisco and then charged (almost a year later) with conspiracy to traffic narcotics, money laundering, and computer hacking. During his trial, he claimed his prosecution violated the fourth amendment (i.e. right to protection against unwarranted searches), since the only way the FBI could have identified him was through the illegal help of the NSA and its data-gathering trickery. Needless to say, this defense didn't exactly work, yet the Intercept noted that the NSA's OAKSTAR project got under way six months before Ulbricht was arrested. More interestingly, the website also published classified documents in November 2017 revealing that the NSA had secretly helped the FBI secure other convictions in the past.Whatever the truth behind Ulbricht's conviction, it's clear that the NSA has had the ability to covertly identify Bitcoin users for over five years, while it's also true that other US agencies have been tracking crypto transactions (using undisclosed means). As such, it's a safe bet to say that American crypto users should probably think carefully before engaging in anything Uncle Sam wouldn't condone.It would appear that few nations can match the US in the reach and power of their crypto-tracking activities. However, this isn't stopping many from trying. In China, reports emerged in March that the Public Information Network Security Supervision (PINSS) agency has been monitoring foreign crypto-exchanges that serve Chinese customers. Even though the government has banned domestic exchanges and trading on foreign alternatives, this hasn't stopped every Chinese trader from seeking out crypto abroad. Because of this, PINSS has been 'monitoring' foreign exchanges so as to ""prevent illegal money laundering, pyramid schemes [and] fraud,"" according to Chinese news outlet Yicai.While Yicai could confirm via sources at PINSS that such monitoring had been underways since September 2017, it couldn't explain just what kind of monitoring was being pursued, or whether the Chinese government was actively trying to identify individuals trading in crypto. Still, whatever the extent of the surveillance involved, the knowledge that other nations are tracking crypto would indicate that Chinese traders should also add themselves to the growing list of 'people who ought to be careful.'So too should Indian traders, who in January may or may not have learned that their government was keeping tabs on them for tax purposes. Actually, chances are they would have learned about this, since the Indian tax department sent notices to ""tens of thousands"" of investors (according to Reuters), after having conducted national surveys and having obtained user data from nine Indian exchanges. This provided a clear signal that the government was indeed tracking cryptocurrency transactions, something which it had begun contemplating in July 2017, when India's Supreme Court demanded information from it and the Reserve Bank of India on the steps being taken to ensure that crypto isn't being used for illicit purposes.As reported in July by Indian news website LiveMint, the system the government was considering, would involve cooperation between the central bank, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), and India's intelligence agencies. However, as the involvement of India's crypto-exchanges in January's tax notices reveals, it's once again likely that the system currently rests on input from these exchanges, rather than on technology comparable to the NSA's, for instance.Other than the prominent examples of Japan, Russian, the US, China and India, there are few other cases of national governments going public with (or being known for) crypto-tracking systems. Nonetheless, even if there's currently no public record of other governments investigating the potential for tracking systems, it's highly probable that those governments with a significant interest in crypto have contemplated a tracking system in one form or another.For example, the UK and EU governments jointly announced in December 2017 that they're planning a ""crackdown"" on crypto-enabled money laundering and tax evasion. UK economic secretary to the Treasury Stephen Barclay said in last October:""The UK government is currently negotiating amendments to the anti-money-laundering directive that will bring virtual currency exchange platforms and custodian wallet providers into anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing regulation, which will result in these firms’ activities being overseen by national competent authorities for these areas.""While this doesn't confirm tracking, it would at least imply it, since the ability to enforce AML legislation entails that governmental bodies and departments should have some means of not only detecting when someone is earning crypto that needs to be taxed, but also determining just who that person is. Hence, UK and EU authorities need to have some kind of tracking system in place, otherwise their threats of 'cracking down' on money laundering and the like will equate to only so much hot air.And in the future, it may become increasingly possible for them or any other government, regardless of technological development, to carry through with such threats. In April, a corporate giant none other than Amazon, received a patent for a ""streaming data marketplace"" that would permit the combining of multiple data sources, thereby enabling the real-time tracking of cryptocurrency transactions and the users involved. As the text of the patent makes clear, this technology could potentially be offered to governments, who would be able to link crypto addresses to official IDs:""The electronic retailers may combine the shipping address with the bitcoin transaction data to create correlated data and republish the combined data as a combined data stream. A group of telecommunications providers may subscribe downstream to the combined data stream and be able to correlate the IP (Internet Protocol) addresses of the transactions to countries of origin. Government agencies may be able to subscribe downstream and correlate tax transaction data to help identify transaction participants.""Given the arrival of such technology (and the current existence of such firms as Chainalysis), it's only a matter of time before transactions involving Bitcoin, Ethereum or any other non-privacy cryptocurrency will be systematically de-anonymized. It will take some time, particularly given that Amazon's patent requires its users (e.g. retailers and telecoms providers) to combine separate pieces of data in order to create correlations. Still, it's becoming increasingly apparent that things are moving in only one direction when it comes to the privacy and anonymity of crypto.And in light of this direction, anyone wanting to keep their chances of being identified as low as possible is advised to migrate to one of the so-called privacy coins. Monero is the most well-known of these, having entered into 10 most valuable cryptocurrencies by market cap since its initial launch in April 2014. More than anything else, what distinguishes it from the likes of Bitcoin is its CryptoNight proof-of-work algorithm, which uses a mix of ring signatures and stealth addresses to not only bury the sender's wallet address in those of multiple other users, but also to hide the precise amount being transferred.It's because of this that the cryptocurrency has proven popular with those who've needed to evade government power (for whatever reason), and such is Monero's apparent ability in preserving anonymity that its price increased by around 2,883% between Jan. 1 and Dec. 31, 2017 (from $12.3 to $358). By contrast, Bitcoin's 2017 growth rate was a slightly less impressive 1,357%.2,883% may be impressive, but it pales in comparison to the 9,000% growth enjoyed in 2017 by Dash, another altcoin with certain privacy-enhancing qualities. The 13th most valuable cryptocurrency by total market cap, its PrivateSend feature mixes addresses so as to obscure the origins and destinations of transactions, in the process making it noticeably harder for any interested authority to put the pieces together.This may be a part of the reason why the currency has took off so spectacularly in Venezuela, where the government cracked down on such cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, in a big way last year (before showing favoritism towards its own oil-backed Petro coin). Venezuelans also turned increasingly to Zcash during this period, which has become the 21st biggest cryptocurrency since launching in October 2016. Building upon Bitcoin Core's architecture and using zero-knowledge proofs, it keeps the sender and receiver's pseudonyms private, while also doing the same for the quantity being transacted.Therefore, a choice of privacy coins is available for anyone worried about the growing ability of governments to track crypto transactions. And even if a concerned crypto user holds no Monero, Dash, or Zcash, they can still take advantage of the various mixing services available for non-privacy coins. For example, there are anonymization protocols available that, much like the features available via Monero and Zcash, enables senders and receivers of Bitcoin to mix their transactions with those of other senders and receivers, making it very difficult to disentangle the multiple threads involved. Such protocols include the likes of CoinJoin, Dark Wallet, bestmixer.io, SharedCoin, and CoinSwap, all of which also provide holders of Bitcoin and other cryptos with the ability to anonymize their transactions.So even though cryptocurrency tracking is increasing, crypto investors and holders needn't be overly fearful of government surveillance. For one, most of the tracking systems in use or which are being developed rely on input from crypto-exchanges, while others (such as those provided by Chainalysis) depend on scavenging data that users may have left carelessly throughout the web. Meanwhile, more direct and intrusive methods being honed by the NSA also rely on crypto users unknowingly compromising their internet connections, something which couldn't be counted on for monitoring all cryptocurrency transactions en masse. This is why, in addition to such privacy coins as Monero and Zcash, privacy-conscious crypto holders shouldn't be too concerned, since there are ways of remaining anonymous for those who want it bad enough."

Singh said that altcoins “will never come back” to their previous levels, stating that firms like Fidelity and BlackRock are “not going to launch altcoin products, they’re going to launch Bitcoin products.”Talking specifically about BitPay, the company’s CCO claimed that the they have “never been more bullish” on Bitcoin, saying the industry is going “full-speed ahead,” with a growing number of partnerships and new hires.In this regard, BitPay was recently integrated by luxury auto retailer Post Oak Motor Cars to enable the U.S. dealership to accept BTC and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) as payment for Rolls-Royce, Bentley and Bugatti.Concerning new “big entrants” to the industry, anonymous sources today revealed that U.S. banking giant Morgan Stanley is planning to offer clients Bitcoin trade swaps, which would enable them to trade crypto derivatives without holding any of the cryptocurrency."

blockchain technology exists today — is that it exists for primarily one ...","Sep 21, 2018",This interview has been edited and condensed.,"Known in mainstream media as a young “Bitcoin millionaire,” within the crypto and blockchain industry, Jeremy Gardner is a known more for what he does than how much he makes.As a serial blockchain entrepreneur, educator and investor, Gardner has founded the global educational nonprofit the Blockchain Education Network and co-founded the blockchain-based prediction platform Augur. Most recently, he launched his own impact investing fund called Ausum Ventures.Olivia Capozzalo: Can you walk me through what mass adoption is — not from the tech or building side of things, but from the side of regular people? What does it look like? What does it mean? Jeremy Gardner: So, my point during the panel discussion was that mass adoption has nothing to do with education. Mass adoption has to do with building products that people want. Mass adoption happens no other way.You don’t suddenly educate hundreds of millions or billions of people on the virtues of decentralization and libertarian values and then expect that it is going to make them want to use Bitcoin or use blockchain-based applications.No. What you’re going to do is create tools that people want in their lives that they don’t have today.The reason why Bitcoin was initially adopted — the reason why Bitcoin and blockchain technology exists today — is that it exists for primarily one reason and one reason only. People don’t like to say this, but it’s because of the dark markets.If there was no Silk Road, if there was no reason for people to actually buy and use Bitcoin to buy drugs online, I’m not sure it would exist today. I think otherwise it’s just a libertarian, cypherpunk thought experiment.It was only once individuals in the developed world actually had a purpose for acquiring these crypto tokens to exchange in commerce that Bitcoin achieved meaningful value — once people understood that Bitcoin allowed people to do something they could not do before.There are other examples in Cyprus, Venezuela, and Zimbabwe — places that have had really awful hyperinflation — places like India with demonetization, China with capital control, South Korea with capital controls.The use cases have emerged, but initially, you know, initially the use case of Bitcoin was buying drugs on the internet, and that was great. But it didn’t actually have to do with the underlying ideological ethos that its earlier adherents had been attracted to.And that’s going to be true with all blockchain technology. We’re simply going to build tools that people want in order to get adoption. No ideology, no education about the virtues.We could try to act like missionaries and spread the word like a religion, but it’s not the best way to do things. As long as we build tech that people want, they will come, and they will adopt it.Watch the full interview with Jeremy Gardner here:OC: It’s just funny because I spoke with Jason Bloomberg recently who also says Bitcoin first became popular for buying drugs on the darknet. But he says that’s a problem, and we need to do something about it — we need to outlaw or ban permissionless cryptocurrencies.JG: Well, that is beyond idiotic. First of all, the DEA (United States Drug Enforcement Agency) recently said that use cases of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies — or crypto assets, in particular — have dropped from 90 percent [80 percent] being black market to 10 percent today. And it’s only going to get lower because, guess what? blockchains are publicly transparent ledgers.The whole value of public blockchains are these transparent, immutable, censorship-resistant ledgers that allow for an open world of finance — compared to the closed world of finance that we have today.I mean, look at what Credit Suisse did in Mexico. They literally made deposit boxes so cartels could fit massive boxes of cash into them. It’s not like the current financial system is protecting us from organized crime and criminal activity.I mean, who is paying more in fines for fraud than anyone in history? I mean, it’s JPMorgan. These banks are not a better system than today. The financial system today is much more culpable for things like terrorism and crime than blockchain technology perhaps ever will be.You know what can be used for illegal activity and is actually is used for illegal activity more than anything else in the world?OC: USD?JG: $100 bills. Benjamins. More than 80 percent of black market activity is used with American $100 bills. Should we go and ban the dollar? I don’t think anybody in their right mind would argue that — I would, because Bitcoin would go up. Come on, I mean, that is just an absurd statement!I mean, look, Bitcoin is digital cash, digital gold — whatever you want to call it. It is an online form of value. It is no different than the money systems that we have today, besides the fact that it may be better.Technology is morally agnostic. It can be used for good, it can be used for evil.I think collectively — as a community — whether you have that impact thesis or not, you should aim to invest in technology that makes the world better, because blockchains are all about network effects.  And so, to suggest that we should ban it, to me, is just mind-boggling. I could never get behind such an option.OC: I fully agree with you.OC: I’m wondering about something like Pornhub using crypto — in terms of what that does for adoption. Is that something that you think is important or impactful?JG: So, I’m very biased here. I know the MindGeek [Pornhub’s parent company] guys. I’m not a huge fan of the porn industry, but they got in touch with me and told me that they want to get involved in this space. I was nothing short of thrilled.If you think about what the porn industry has done over the past two decades when it comes to technology adoption, it’s mind-boggling.I mean, they are the reasons why we used VHS. They are the reasons why we used DVD over Betamax. They have increased streaming capacity and the capacity of content delivery networks more so than any other technology company on the planet.Porn companies are technology companies. They have been radical innovators in the world of tech.If they show this technology works — I mean, they are one of the largest content delivery networks on the planet — if they show this tech works, other content delivery networks that may not be in not such a sketchy industry may adopt as well, and they will see a massive upside and increase of their holdings.So, look, I feel very ambiguous about porn — I’m not a huge fan of it — but their ability to be, kind of, thought leaders and trailblazers in the space is remarkable. And they have historically been in the world of tech, and internet technology and even cinematography.A lot of other industries are very nervous about adopting blockchain tech because it’s so new, it’s so cutting-edge, and they don’t want to piss off shareholders — they are the largest tech companies in the world. But guess what? MindGeek is privately owned and they have more of a capacity to innovate and adopt new technology than a lot of the big, publicly traded companies that are out there. So, I’m hopeful.OC: So, to get a little bit of a bigger picture than the entertainment industry — who needs blockchain adoption? What does it mean that they need it?JG: Who needs to learn about blockchain technology and who needs it are different. It’s the disenfranchised who need blockchain technology.And when I say disenfranchised or disadvantaged, I mean a massive subset of the world’s population. I mean, pretty much everyone except for me — like, a white, middle-class, heterosexual man who lives in the United States, who lives in San Francisco. Unless I want to buy drugs off of the internet, I literally have no really strong use cases. Maybe decentralized prediction markets are an exception.But for the two billion people in the world who have no access to financial services and the four billion that have limited access — that includes that initial two billion — that’s what blockchain technology is made for. That’s where we will see the real adoption.The ability to have a bank account in your pocket, to have something that is secure and safe in your pocket, cryptographically, in a way that money under your bed or behind your wallet is now — that is revolutionary.It affects the people that are dealing with predatory institutions — whether they are governments, whether they are financial services, businesses or, you know, governments that exploit their positions of power as middlemen to disenfranchise their consumers and their users.Because what blockchain technology affords is radical disintermediation.Blockchain technology is the most radically disintermediated technology that’s ever existed. In that, if you want to transfer value — whether it’s money, the title to your house, the rights to your land — you can now do it in a way that only requires a single counterparty: the person who’s buying it from you.And that is a massive upgrade from the world that we live in today, in which all sorts of clearing houses and third-party institutions that are necessitated due to a lack of trust in transactions. But with blockchain technology, you can actually have trustless financial or value exchange.Now, how do we get there? It’s not entirely clear. You know, with remittance solutions today, trials today, about giving directly to folks such as this, but we’ve historically primarily been building the blockchain technology for the people that need it least: you and me, people in the United States, people in the West.And that’s not where the blockchain technology is going to have its biggest impact.But first, we need to be bringing in entrepreneurs from these places where they are disenfranchised. Bringing the disenfranchised and having them build products out of their own experiences.That way it can be paired with technology companies in the West that are probably most well-equipped to build this software and tech.But, we need to include the people who have the most benefit from this technology, and we haven’t done a great job doing that, yet.OC: And do you see that happening really on the private scale? How is regulation going to affect this process?JG: We’ve convinced regulators that blockchain technology is the Holy Grail of everything. I don’t find regulators to be any sort of hinderance on getting this tech adopted.Whether it’s in the EU or U.S., even in Africa or East Asia, governments are getting behind trials of this technology to improve the lives of their people — sometimes for more authoritarian purposes, such as distributed ledger-based money in China and Russia — but overwhelmingly, governments have actually been a massive catalyst for the adoption of trials with this technology.What I do think about is how we do reach the people that need this most and actually understand how this technology can help them. And that’s just kind of a long-term undertaking that will require the help of many governments and NGOs to really understand.Because entrepreneurs often have this problem, especially in this industry, where they create solutions for problems that don’t exist. What we have to do is be identifying problems and then seeing if a blockchain can help mitigate that problem.The general answer is ‘no,’ but you have to take a problem-first approach. Trying to build solutions without problems is probably the greatest fallacy of Silicon Valley and beyond.OC: What’s your opinion on government-backed cryptocurrencies?JG: They’re going to do them, but they’re not cryptocurrencies in the traditional sense. They are distributed ledger-based, centrally banked money that is issued and monitored and controlled and validated by central banks.I think there’s a lot of good evidence that suggests that central bank-issued cryptocurrency — crypto assets or e-money, if you want to call it that — actually would be better than the digital cash that we have today.But it is the antithesis of what we’ve been building in the blockchain space/cryptocurrency space so far, because this is going to be incredibly Orwellian.They’re going to see every transaction that’s ever been made, there’s going to be KYC (Know Your Customer) and they’re going to know who’s making those transactions.And that, in fact, in my view, will be the greatest catalyst for the mass adoption of cryptocurrencies as we know them today, whether it’s Bitcoin or something else.When there’s government-backed cryptocurrencies and we move to a cashless society in which there is no financial privacy in our daily financial transactions, that is when something like Bitcoin or a stablecoin — something that is not bank- or government-issued — will become popular. That’s when we’ll see mass adoption, not before.You know, if Bitcoin were going to be mass-adopted this decade, it would have happened five years ago, three years ago. But it’s too volatile, it’s too hard to use, it’s too hard to understand.But when people are forced to use it — because there’s no longer cash, which is kind of a grey economy and a massive part of the global economy overall — once that economy disappears in its current form without cash, which will happen over the next 50-70 years, that’s when we’ll see mass adoption of cryptocurrencies — decentralized cryptocurrencies — as we know them today.Because people want to use cash. People want to make financial transactions that the government doesn’t know about — whether it’s paying your babysitter or your illegal immigrant.OC: You think a lot of people care about that? I just feel like most people don’t care about their privacy.JG: Literally, almost every family in America pays their nanny in cash and that nanny is not reporting it to the IRS and they are not reporting that to IRS. It is not uncommon that people want to do business in a way that is not being traced by the government or just want some privacy in their financial transactions — virtually almost every person on the planet.The grey economy is absolutely massive, and the second you take away cash, it becomes much harder to engage in — especially if we’ve moved to a distributed ledger-based financial system, where not only is every transaction traceable, but it’s also tied to your identity, which is way worse than what we have today.So, you really have to think about the ramifications of a world in which there is no cash, no ability to take place in an informal economy. That, for sure, will lead to the mass adoption of cryptocurrencies.JG: We need, kind of, an open sandbox for innovation before we’re really ready for a lot of regulations. But there are certain areas, like securities laws, where it would be great if we could, kind of amend them for the reality of these tokenized securities, which are a very new concept.OC: How exactly?JG: So, if you think about the securities today, the reason why they are so heavily regulated is that they are not transparent — you don’t have any insight into the cash flow except for quarterly reports.But, in theory, a lot of use cases for tokenized securities could be securities that pay automatically based off of the revenue of a software project — like, I should be able to sell tokens from my software project that every user, every transaction goes back to investors, like a portion of revenue. It’s transparent, it’s immutable, it’s on blockchain.And thus, I shouldn’t have file an S1 and take a company public to offer that to your everyday consumer. People should be able to buy that in an ICO [Initial Coin Offering] and gain access to upside of this new software company that I’m building, because it’s so straightforward how they get paid out — where the revenue or the dividends are coming from.OC: Right, yeah. And there are just a lot more hoops to jump through. And the law is from the 1930s...JG:  Right. You generally have to assume that a law that was written in the 1930s with regard to financial regulations is going to be at least partly outdated by 2018.OC: I still want to talk a little bit more about your personal opinions on crypto, not about regulation. You’ve definitely publicly stated that you own crypto.JG: Yes. Most of my money is in crypto.OC: Right. So there is the fact that governments, consumers — people on a mass scale — pay attention to crypto and blockchain in relation to its price.The price of Bitcoin going up a lot in December got a lot of press, mainstream media started reporting on it, etc. Since you’ve been in it a long time, what do you say to that kind of reaction?JG: You know, I was somewhere in the world — I was either in India or Greece — when the markets last dropped and I actually didn’t learn about the drop in market price for, like, several days.I don’t pay attention to the price. I kind of knew from following crypto Twitter that there had been a price drop, but people, kind of, speak about it ambiguously.I don’t care about the price at all. If there were any underlying investment fundamentals driving the price of the crypto assets, I’d be concerned.In crypto, price fluctuations are just hocus pocus — it’s just totally sentiment-driven. Nothing really drives the price increases or decreases besides just, like, FOMO [fear of missing out] sentiment and irrationality in the market. I’ve got a hedge fund side of my venture fund and it’s performing pretty abysmally right now because we don’t trade. I don’t try to time the market.What I do is I invest in crypto assets. I believe we’re going to change the world and I just stopped caring. I don’t pay attention.OC: You personally never trade?JG: No, look, I’ve been in the industry since 2014. I wasn’t in that early, I didn’t make my money in Bitcoin, I made my money in other crypto assets — a little bit in Bitcoin.You know, I’m often lauded or labeled as a Bitcoin millionaire — not really how I made my money. I invested in technology that I really believed in — whether it was Ether or, back then, XRP at a much different price — and I just held them. I never thought about it, I never traded them, I never watched the volatility.I mean, this whole trader ethos that permeates the industry is just flabbergasting to me. These are illiquid markets. A single individual, a single factor in the trade can totally move the market against the way your Elliot-wave analysis predicted it was going to go.These are not like traditional financial markets, which are deeply liquid, which are based off of companies with really strong fundamentals, cash flow, P-to-E ratios — you don’t have any of that here.What you have are very speculative commodities that are potentially going to change the world, but none of them are yet. You know, Bitcoin maybe being the exception. So, if you’re not investing based on the long-term value proposition of a crypto asset or some really fantastic insider information about what that announcement about the crypto asset is, you’re never going to make money trading.You know, I’ve met a lot of smart traders back in the fall of 2017. I don’t know any of those guys today. These guys were not actually that smart.Everyone is smart in a bull market. But the guys that are smart in a bear market — or a downward market — are the guys that actually have conviction in their investment.Now, I may go double-down on some of my investments, but I’m surely not selling right now like many people are. But most people who bought crypto assets in the past year, they just bought it because, “Oh, I have a feeling that this one is going to go up,” but now it’s going down and they’re selling, and there’s panic in the market, and there’s blood in the streets, and I love it.I just get such masochistic joy, like, “Oh, my net worth is down 80 percent,” but I’m not concerned because I know it’s going to go up another 10,000 or 100,000 percent because the investments I made are valuable.It’s a massive failure on the part of our industry not to be cynical about these price rises. If you look at my interviews back in mid-late 2017, I was calling these ICOs insanity, I was calling the market insanity, It was irrational, it didn’t make sense.OC: What do you think about the mainstream media’s involvement in all that?JG: I mean, can you blame them? You have the fastest appreciating asset class in history just roaring and turning 26-year-olds like me into multi-millionaires. It’s a compelling narrative! You can’t ignore it.There’s never been an asset class like this that has enriched so many normal people. It’s something that the news is of course going to latch onto. Because what does everybody want? Everyone wants to be rich overnight. Who wants to be a millionaire?Like, everybody wants to make money and they want to make it easily. And so, there’s this incredible new investment class that’s turning average Joes into very wealthy people. They’re going to report it! You just can’t blame them.Now, do I wish they educated themselves more? Yes, but it is not their job.I mean, if you want to be educated on blockchain technology and crypto assets, you’re going to have to immerse yourself for 90 percent of your life for the next six to 12 months of your life before you even have a baseline understanding of how this tech works and what its real purposes are and how it’s used.And so, to expect the mainstream media to be able to report this accurately is not particularly reasonable. Now, I wish they did a little bit better due diligence, but at the end of a day, you really cannot expect the media to do a very good job.OC: Okay, but I more mean the effects of this media attention.JG: I mean, they are awful because they bring average Joes, who have no idea what they are investing in, into this new asset class. I mean, god, I just do not want consumer investors investing in this.I’d love larger institutions, I’d love people who want to go and educate themselves. Your average consumer is buying Tesla because they think Teslas are cool cars or buying Amazon because they use Amazon every day — hey, maybe they could be good investments, maybe bad investments.But they are sure as hell not using Bitcoin in their daily lives, so it’s not something they should be investing in. You know, unless you understand what you’re investing in, you shouldn’t be investing in it.Unless you have a very balanced portfolio — like, look I think everybody should put five to 10 percent of their investment portfolio into Bitcoin and Ether, maybe a couple of other crypto assets — but that’s because when you do that, when you put five percent of your investment portfolio into a highly speculative, uncorrelated asset class, you actually mitigate the overall risk of your investment portfolio simply because it is uncorrelated.And thus, even a grandma should put a tiny bit of her investment portfolio in Bitcoin, but she shouldn’t be mortgaging her house to do it, and it shouldn’t be a huge amount of money. It should only be a very small, yet respectable amount of portfolio — just due to the historical performance of this asset class. But the media narrative has definitely driven people to put way too much of their money into crypto.OC: I ask because people do argue that the mainstream media’s attention helps with awareness, or it’s something important for, again, mass adoption. But that’s why we have to clarify what mass adoption means.JG: Yeah, like, what is mass adoption?Mass adoption of Bitcoin as a payment system? Yeah right, not going to happen. Not any time soon.Well I’m saying, when we go to a cashless society, people will really have a use case, but using cash is almost always going to be better than using Bitcoin today.And so, mass adoption is not going to happen until we create tools that actually catalyze that adoption. But that’s certainly not where we are right now.OC: Okay, cool. Thank you so much!Cointelegraph’s editorial team thanks Jeremy Gardner and BlockShow for the interview."

GBTC is an open-ended grantor trust, the purpose of which is to track BTC market price.According to Bloomberg, shares of GBTC have dropped by around 80 percent since Bitcoin hit almost $20,000 last December. The drop purportedly follows the fall of the BTC price, which is down nearly 66 percent during the same timeframe.Some investors attribute part of GBTC’s downward trend to its expense fees, as the company charges $20 for every $1,000 invested, or two percent. In comparison, the average mutual fund expense ratio is around 0.59 percent.  Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at financial services firm TF Global Markets U.K. Ltd., told Bloomberg that ""expense ratios are insane for these funds and the current Bitcoin price is creating more problems.""Previously, Cointelegraph reported that institutional investors replaced high net-worth individuals as the biggest buyers of cryptocurrency transactions worth over $100,000. Traditional investors and hedge funds have reportedly become more involved in the $220 billion crypto market through private transactions. At the same time, miners have begun scheduling regular coin sales instead of holding or offloading them during market rallies.Last month, Chainalysis published a study revealing that BTC investors and speculators held their positions over the summer, while markets seem to have become more stable overall. The monetary aggregates reportedly were “extremely steady” during the summer, showing that the amount of BTC held for speculation was stable from May to August at around 22 percent of available BTC. The amount of BTC held for investment also showed stability during the same period at around 30 percent."

He predicted that the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization will jump more than 700 percent from its current price level by the end of 2018.Investors, however, should be cautious and only invest the money they can afford to lose, because every analyst gets a call wrong once in a while.On the side of fundamentals, the news and developments remain strong. Switzerland-based startup SEBA Crypto AG, led by former UBS bankers, has raised about $103 million to set up a bank offering cryptocurrency-related services.Ukraine’s central bank is planning to launch a state-owned digital currency tied to the national fiat currency at a rate of 1:1. This plan has been in the pipeline for some time now, but still, it will be interesting to see the markets’ reaction if Ukraine launches a government-backed cryptocurrency.Is the trend for cryptocurrencies about to reverse? Let’s find out.Note: as a number of cryptocurrencies are showing bottom formations or buy setups, we are recommending them. However, the traders should not jump in and invest all available capital. They should do their own due diligence and only attempt the trades they are confident about. The sentiment is still bearish; hence, caution is warranted.Bitcoin has broken out of the moving averages, but is facing resistance at the September 22 intraday high of $6,831.99. The downtrend line of the descending triangle is located just above this level at $6,930. We expect the bears to mount a stiff resistance in this zone.If the bulls succeed in breaking out of the downtrend line, a move to $7,413.46 is possible. We anticipate a strong bout of short covering if this level is scaled. Therefore, the traders can hold their long positions with the stops at $5,900.On the downside, the supports are at $6,583.46 and $6,341. If these supports break, a retest of the critical support zone of $5,900–$6,075 is probable.Currently, both moving averages are flat and the RSI is close to the neutral zone, which suggests consolidation in the short-term. The next directional move on the upside will start after the BTC/USD pair sustains above $6,930.The bulls have held on to the $200 level for the past three days, but are struggling to push price above the 20-day EMA. If this resistance is crossed, the next major resistance is the 50-day SMA. Ethereum has not broken out of the 50-day SMA since May 24, hence, this becomes an important level on the upside.If the ETH/USD pair sustains above the 50-day SMA, a rally to $322 is probable. Aggressive traders can attempt this trade on a breakout above $255.On the downside, the support levels are $200 and $192.5. The downtrend will resume if the bears break below the September 12 low of $167.32.Ripple has been trading between $0.45 and $0.58 for the past few days. A consolidation, after such a stupendous move is to be expected.The 20-day EMA is sloping up and the RSI is also in the positive territory. This shows that the bulls have an upper hand. Therefore, traders can buy a breakout above $0.583, if it sustains for at least 4 hours. The stop loss can be kept at $0.42. The target objective is a retest of the September 21 high of $0.7644.If the bears break below $0.42, the XRP/USD pair can slump to $0.35 and below that to $0.26913, completing a 100 percent retracement of the recent rally.In the past two days, Bitcoin Cash has rallied sharply, breaking out of both moving averages and the resistance line of the descending channel. This has flattened both the moving averages and has pushed the RSI above 50 levels, which is considered positive. Above $600, the rally can extend to $660.The bears are currently attempting to push the price back below the moving averages. A break down of the 20-day EMA will indicate weakness and can result in a retest of the recent lows at $408.0182.The downtrend will resume if the BCH/USD pair breaks down of $408.0182. Traders who are long on our recommendation should keep a stop loss of $400. Partial profits can be booked at $660 and the stops on the rest should be raised to breakeven.EOS held the 50-day SMA for the past three days and the bulls have succeeded in pushing the price above $5.65, which is encouraging. The recovery can extend to $6.3117 and above that to $6.8299.The 20-day EMA is sloping up and the 50-day SMA is flat. The RSI has also entered the positive territory, which suggests that the buyers have the upper hand in the short-term.Our bullish view will be invalidated if the EOS/USD pair breaks down of $5. Therefore, traders can raise the stops on their long positions to $4.9.Stellar is stuck between the downtrend line of the descending triangle and the 20-day EMA. A break out of the overhead resistance zone of $0.275–$0.305 will invalidate the bearish pattern, which is a positive sign.The upside targets are a move to $0.36, followed by a rally to $0.46. The rising 20-day EMA and the RSI in the positive territory show that the bulls have an advantage in the short-term.Our bullish view on the XLM/USD pair will be invalidated if the bears sink the price below the 50-day EMA. Therefore, the bulls can hold their long positions with the stop loss at $0.21.Though Litecoin is range bound, it is attracting some buying. The price has risen well above the 50-day SMA, which is a positive sign.The bulls are likely to attempt a break out of the range within the next few days. If successful, the LTC/USD pair will complete a double bottom formation that has a minimum target objective of $89.The RSI has climbed into the positive zone and the moving averages are on the verge of a bullish crossover, which increases the probability of a break out of the range.We suggest traders wait for the price to sustain above $69.279 for about four hours and then initiate long positions.The initial stop loss can be placed just below the September 12 lows, and trailed higher to $54 if the breakout fails to pick up momentum. We are attempting to catch a change in trend, hence, expect some volatility and whipsaws. Please keep the position size at about 50 percent of usual.The recovery in Cardano has again hit a roadblock at the 50-day SMA. The bears will now try to break down of the 20-day EMA and push the price to the lower support at $0.071355. A breakdown of this support can result in a retest of the lows at $0.060105.If the bulls defend $0.071355, the 20-day EMA and the RSI point to a range formation. The  ADA/USD pair will attract buyers if the price breaks out of the 50-day SMA and the highs of September 23.We didn’t find a reliable buy setup at the current levels. Therefore, we are not recommending a long position on the pair.Though Monero has held the 20-day EMA for the past four days, it has failed to sustain above $120. This shows selling at higher levels. The bears will now attempt to break below the 20-day EMA and push the price towards the 50-day SMA.If the XMR/USD pair breaks down of the symmetrical triangle, it can slide to $96.390 and $87.382. Therefore, we suggest traders keep a stop at $100 on their long positions.Currently, the 20-day EMA is sloping up while the 50-day SMA is flat. The RSI is close to the neutral territory, which points to a range formation in the near-term. The first bullish sign will be a break out of the downtrend line, which can result in a rally to $140.Dash has been holding the 50-day SMA for the past three days but is struggling to sustain above the 20-day EMA. It has formed a symmetrical triangle, a break out of which can push the price above the overhead resistance of $224.830.On the other hand, if the DASH/USD pair breaks down of the triangle, it can decline to $160, followed by a retest of the lows.Both moving averages have turned flat and the RSI is at the midpoint. This shows a state of equilibrium between the buyers and the sellers. The next move will start when the price breaks out or breaks down of the triangle.The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. The charts for the analysis are provided by TradingView."

connection with security-based swaps funded with Bitcoin (BTC).","Sep 28, 2018","The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has filed charges against international securities dealer 1pool Ltd., which was offering Bitcoin-funded security-based swaps, according to an SEC announcement published September 27.","Per the SEC, the case involves the Marshall Islands-based corporation 1pool Ltd., which provides cryptocurrency-related services and stands behind 1broker.com, and its Austria-based CEO Patrick Brunner. The complaint alleges that the parties violated federal securities laws in connection with security-based swaps funded with Bitcoin (BTC).The complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement plus interest, and penalties. The SEC states that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has filed its own charges against 1pool in a parallel action.According to the complaint, a Special Agent with Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), acting undercover, purchased security-based swaps on 1broker’s platform from the U.S., though he did not comply with the discretionary investment thresholds required by the federal securities laws. The SEC also adds that users could open accounts on the platform with their email address and a user name only, without providing additional information.The SEC further alleges that Brunner and 1broker failed to transact its security-based swaps on a traditional exchange registered in the U.S., as well as properly register as a security-based swaps dealer. Shamoil T. Shipchandler, Director of the SEC’s Fort Worth Regional Office commented:“International companies that transact with U.S. investors cannot circumvent compliance with the federal securities laws by using cryptocurrency.”This week, the SEC announced it is seeking sanctions against the individuals behind the allegedly fraudulent Initial Coin Offering (ICO) known as PlexCoin. The parties are accused of “misappropriating” investor funds that were “illegally” raised in a misleading, deceptive, and unregistered securities offering.Earlier this month, the SEC issued a cease and desist order and a $200,000 fine to Crypto Asset Management (CAM) and its founder Timothy Enneking. The SEC order says that CAM “misrepresented” itself as the ""first regulated crypto asset fund in the United States,"" and raised $3.6 million from 44 investors in late 2017, bringing its net asset value to $37 million."

Decision. CNBC's Cryptotrader host Ran Neuner says it is “too ...","Oct 8, 2018",Crypto analyst and host of CNBC’s show Cryptotrader Ran Neuner has claimed that the price of Bitcoin (BTC) is “about to explode” in a recent tweet October 7.,"Neuner expressed his utmost confidence in an upcoming surge in Bitcoin’s price by noting “I just bought Bitcoin for my parents” in the same tweet. A notable rally would likely be tied to the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) highly-anticipated upcoming decision on several Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) applications, the trader claimed in another tweet posted the same day.Explaining his optimistic prediction, the crypto analyst pointed to the fact that the leading cryptocurrency’s rally last year from “$6,691 (Nov 11) to $20,000 (Dec 17)” was, according to him, “on the back of  the expectation and launch of a cash settlement BTC futures contract.”Following confirmation from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) that the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) were eligible to launch Bitcoin futures, CBOE was the first to launch Bitcoin futures on December 11, while CME launched soon after on December 17 – the day Bitcoin has hit its historic high of $20,000.Pointing at Bitcoin futures, Neuner made a parallel with the SEC’s much-anticipated decision on the first Bitcoin ETFs to be approved by the regulator. The analyst claimed that a Bitcoin ETF is a “way bigger deal” than a cash settlement Bitcoin futures contract, since it “requires actual purchase of BTC.”Many point to a Bitcoin ETF helping Bitcoin reach more mainstream investors, since they would not have to directly invest in the underlying asset, in this case the cryptocurrency. If listed on a regulated U.S. exchange, a Bitcoin ETF could potentially push Bitcoin toward broader recognition on Wall Street.While the SEC have recently scheduled their deadline of November 5 for reviewing nine Bitcoin ETF applications from three different applicants, the actual effects of an approved Bitcoin ETF’s launch on crypto markets is up for debate.In late July this year, the SEC rejected the application for a Bitcoin ETF from brothers Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss for the second time, following previous rejection in March 2017. Shortly after the rejection, SEC Commissioner Hester M. Peirce made a statement of official dissent from the agency’s disapproval of the Winklevoss fund appeal. Peirce suggested that the disapproval order will likely “inhibit” the institutionalization of the BTC market."

As Bloomberg reported earlier this week, VanEck’s MVIS CryptoCompare Digital Assets 10 Index – which tracks the prices of top ten digital assets – was down 80 percent as compared with its January high. The data thus represents a heftier plummet than the Nasdaq Composite Index’s 78 percent nosedive at the height of the dot-com crash.Nevertheless, as CT’s analyst argued, key structural differences – including a significantly smaller total market cap size for crypto and the fact that retail investors have a significant footprint in the crypto industry, unlike the venture capitalists of the dotcom days – means that such comparisons are not necessarily as clear-cut as the figures may at first glance suggest."

Co-Founder",https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoins-block-size-can-be-increased-without-hard-fork-says-blockstream-co-founder,"One of the Blockstream co-founders suggests a new Bitcoin scaling concept 
that allegedly does not deploy a hard fork. 14413 Total views.","Oct 6, 2018",Bitcoin (BTC) protocol developer Mark Friedenbach introduced a method for Bitcoin scaling he claims will not require a hard fork at a workshop in Tokyo October 5.,"The new concept presented at the Scaling Bitcoin workshop, entitled “Forward Blocks,” suggests a major on-chain capacity boost by means of a Proof-of-Work (PoW) alternation that is done as a soft fork, combined with use of alternative private ledgers.The proposal describes a method for scaling that claims to be able to increase “settlement transaction volume to 3,584 times current levels” and improve censorship resistance via sharding.During the presentation, Friedenbach suggested  major improvements for on-chain Bitcoin transactions, or those that appear on the Bitcoin blockchain. The so-called “soft-fork” alternation implies a strengthening of consensus rules where old nodes “still see the chain advance.” The research also represents a definition of “forwards compatible soft-fork,” for which non-upgraded nodes still receive and process all transactions.In his presentation, Friedenbach emphasized the role of sharding for increased censorship resistance, noting that he borrowed the “sharding” term from the “database field.” However, the term that is described in the research is “largely not” the sharding that is implied by other major crypto-related projects, but is “nevertheless the correct term to use” in terms of the study.The sharding term has garnered most popularity in reference to the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain’s upcoming major upgrades. Announced in reference to Ethereum’s by its co-founder Vitalik Buterin in April 2018, the term implies a method of increasing the number of transactions that a blockchain can process. The idea of sharding is that for on-chain transactions, multiple network computers can divide the transaction workload between them.Friedenbach, who is also a former NASA contractor, claimed in his talk that he did not set out to consider Bitcoin scaling solutions originally, but was thinking about “the development of a dual PoW change where you introduce a new PoW with a soft-fork.” While suggesting the addition of another PoW algorithm, the developer stressed that his work is not actually a proposal for subsequent changes, but rather an idea for developers to consider and “a good place to start.”The problem of Bitcoin scalability is one of the major topics of discussion around the top cryptocurrency.In July of this year, a group of Bitcoin engineers announced the launch of the Bitcoin Operations Technology Group (Bitcoin Optech) to address the issue of scaling the Bitcoin blockchain. The non-profit team is backed by leading industry actors, such as PayPal Board Member Wences Casares, executive of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. Ltd John Pfeffer, and cryptocurrency research and development group Chaincode Labs."

Kotadiya was allegedly involved in a $1.3 million BTC extortion case.In April, the CID began investiging the reported kidnapping and extortion of 200 BTC from an Indian businessman and builder Sailesh Bhatt. Bhatt accused Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) officer Sunil Nair and other policemen of beating him until he paid a ransom of around $770,000 in February.After he was released, Bhatt was allegedly kidnapped and taken to a farm where he was forced to send 200 BTC to former business partner Kirit Paladiya. Bhatt also claimed that Kotadiya pressured him to pay the ransom.In June, an Indian court declared Kotadiya a proclaimed offender in connection with the case, however Kotadiya “remained untraceable,” even after a warrant was issued for his arrest.In July, a senior official from the Indian opposition party the Indian National Congress (INC), Shaktisinh Gohil, demanded a probe into a “mega Bitcoin scam” estimated at about $723 million.The crime  supposedly involves leaders of the majority BJP, which used BTC as a “cover-up” for money laundering and extortion. While, Kotadiya “remained untraceable,” Gohil said that ""if he is arrested, he will reveal damning evidences which will expose top BJP leaders in the state.""Today, the CID reportedly claimed that custodial interrogation is a necessary part of the investigation, which could help identify the individuals behind the BTC extortion scheme. Additionally, the custodial interrogation aims to discover how the extortion funds were divvied up. Kotadiya reportedly ordered the transfer of Rs 25 lakh ($35,528) to a witness.Speaking before the court, Kotadiya reportedly said he went into hiding because he feared for his life because he was privy to compromising information about politicians and industrial enterprise owners. Kotadiya also said there was a conspiracy to kill him."

Its Fear of Bitcoin",https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-discussions-at-highest-level-the-oecds-love-of-blockchain-obscures-its-fear-of-bitcoin,"Bitcoin for central bankers. The OECD's first foray into reports and policy 
recommendations regarding blockchain came with its June 2014 ...","Sep 10, 2018","For several years now, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has been cautiously enthusiastic about blockchain technology. Beginning with a 2014 working paper titled, ""The Bitcoin Question"" the intergovernmental organization has been considering the economic possibilities opened up by distributed ledgers and cryptocurrencies — and, on the whole, it has found these possibilities exciting, even if such working papers ""do not necessarily reflect the official views of the Organization or of the governments of its member countries.""","But for the most part, reports on ""Blockchain Technology and Competition Policy"" and ""Corporate Governance"" — among other subjects — have struck a largely 'wait-and-see' tone. They've outlined the areas in which distributed ledger technology (DLT) could potentially offer innovations, yet they've also affirmed that institutions should acquire a more complete understanding of DLT and how it works before integrating it into their operations. As June's report on corporate governance concluded, ""it may be worth exploring"" is the kind of phrase often encountered in such analyses.However, this preliminary phase in the OECD's standoffish evaluation of DLTs is drawing to a close. On Sept. 4 and 5, it held its first-ever Blockchain Policy Forum in Paris, where a range of public officials and private leaders came together to meet, to network and, most importantly, to explore just how blockchain technology is being and will be used by businesses and governments. Over the course of the two-day conference, scores of delegates presented a wide variety of use cases of DLTs, from self-sovereign identity to competition law. And in the process, they began to map a way forward for those organizations that have entertained the notion of trialing blockchain tech without actually taking that all-important first step.The OECD's first foray into reports and policy recommendations regarding blockchain came with its June 2014 working paper, ""The Bitcoin Question: Currency Versus Trust-Less Transfer Technology."" Like many traditional institutions that represent the mainstream global economy, the general position expressed by the report's author was that Bitcoin is ""volatile"" and has ""an important scalability problem,"" and that ""a raison d’être for Bitcoins is to carry out illegal activities.""But as has been seen with such Bitcoin-detractors as, say, Mark Carney and Yanis Varoufakis, the report also sung the praises of the blockchain — as it referred to the underlying protocol. According to author Adrian Blundell-Wignall, the special advisor to the OECD secretary-general on financial markets:“[The blockchain] is the key innovation in this technology — that is, a technology that removes the need for a trusted third party and the intermediary costs associated with such institutions (banks, credit card companies, payment companies, non-bank financial intermediaries).""Expanding on the theme of disintermediation, the working paper surveyed the different benefits blockchain technology — rather than Bitcoin — could deliver for businesses, institutions and the global economy more generally. Blundell-Wignall wrote, noting that the imposition of regulation may increase costs for crypto exchanges and other blockchain-based service providers:""This technology has the potential to reduce transactions costs for retail spending with credit cards, e-commerce costs and money transfers. But such companies are intermediaries too, and it should not be forgotten that competition in the cryptocurrency world is fierce, and new decentralized technology innovations may reduce costs dramatically.""Having noted the scalability issues Bitcoin encountered at the time (but which are now being addressed), the paper's author extolled Ripple as an example of a DLT-based system that enables banks to transfer remittances at a fraction of the usual cost and of the usual speed. And while it acknowledged that Ripple may not be the ""ultimate winner"" in the cryptocurrency race, it concluded by advising the OECD's member states to seriously consider looking at comparable, less decentralized blockchain-based technologies.""Policymakers do need to focus on how to ensure that the new technologies operate in the most socially-useful way. That is, it should be possible to make use of a new technology to facilitate the medium-of-exchange transporter and ledger functions and increase competition in financial services, while eliminating the ‘anonymity’ problems [of certain cryptocurrencies].""In sum, the working paper recommended blockchains that don't attempt to usurp the power of governments and central banks over a nation's money supply, but that still retain certain aspects of Bitcoin's transparency and efficiency. And since then, succeeding reports and papers from the OECD have elaborated on this blockchain-friendly approach, with more recent documents outlining particular applications of DLTs.In June, the Directorate for Financial and Enterprise Affairs Competition Committee published an issue paper that outlined the implications blockchain tech would have for competition policy and regulation. As with virtually every other report published by or on behalf of the OECD, almost half of the paper dedicated itself to introducing just what 'the blockchain' is, offering an indication of how public bodies are still very much in the early stages of their flirtation with DLT. It goes, as if a sizeable proportion of its readers have never heard of either Bitcoin or blockchains before:""The most prominent example of a blockchain thus far is Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a non-permissioned or public blockchain, meaning that there is no restriction on who can spend Bitcoin or take part in verifying the authenticity of blocks of transactions in the blockchain (an energy intensive process known as ‘mining’).""To be fair, despite retreading what must be very familiar ground for anyone who's even glanced at a technology website in the past couple of years, the paper does go on to examine how competition policy will have to be updated in view of blockchain adoption. In particular, it highlighted the need of a public debate on whether competition authorities should be given access to blockchains in order to police markets and corporations.""This might enable them to monitor trading prices in real-time, spot suspicious trends, and, when investigating a merger, conduct or market, have immediate access to the necessary data without needing to impose burdensome information requests on parties.""Interestingly, it also underlined the possibility of blockchains being used by companies to collude or ""tacitly coordinate"" in a way that hurts competition, perhaps by enabling members of a trade cartel to know when another member has failed to comply with the terms of the cartel, and by enabling the cartel to mete out punishment accordingly — possibly by the use of smart contacts. The report’s author, Antonio Capobianco, wrote:""The potential transparency offered by a market-wide blockchain might also help firms in oligopolistic markets to coordinate tacitly without any direct or indirect contact, or any agreement to do so. Might full access to observe a market-wide blockchain constitute a ‘plus-factor’ that competition authorities might consider to suggest that parallel conduct was the result of coordination among the parties?""The paper also placed specific attention on the use of blockchain to facilitate anti-competitive behavior, on monopolies in the cryptocurrency industry — e.g., mining companies, crypto exchanges — on setting technical standards, and on ensuring competitive neutrality in the face of subsidies for blockchain adoption. Together, such a focus reveals that the OECD has begun to grapple with how blockchain technology will affect businesses, national economies and international trade. And even if it didn’t attempt to address how any of this would be achievable on a technical level, it treats the widespread adoption of blockchain tech as if it were an inevitability, something which any startup or corporation working within the industry must welcome as an encouraging vote of confidence.It's not only reports and working papers that the OECD has produced with respect to blockchains. In March, its director of financial and enterprise affairs, Greg Medcraft, delivered a presentation at the OECD Friends of Going Digital Meeting in Paris. Titled, ""The OECD and the Blockchain Revolution,"" it urged policymakers to be ""proactive and forward-looking"" in how they treat blockchain from a regulatory standpoint, and to work closely with ""key stakeholders"" — i.e., people and groups within the industry — on drafting appropriate standards and laws. ""This will help us avoid regulatory knee-jerk reactions and resist the temptation to jump in before we properly understand developments,"" Medcraft explained, while still cautioning his audience on ""high-profile theft of assets like Bitcoin, and scam Initial Coin Offerings.""And aside from policy recommendations, blockchain technology has received indirect support from the OECD by way of appearing in its “Embracing Innovation in Government” reports for 2017 and 2018. In its 2017 edition, for instance, it reported on the use of blockchain-based voting in the Colombian 2016 peace referendum (related to the end of the conflict between the national government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia—People's Army [FARC] rebels).""[The] tech nonprofit Democracy Earth Foundation set up a digital process that allowed Colombian expats, who were unable to vote through the official process, an opportunity to participate in a plebiscite on whether to approve a peace treaty. This process raised interesting questions for governments about the future use of blockchain in electoral processes, and in the public sector more broadly, and could potentially lead to new ways to ensure the integrity of the election process.""In much the same way, other reports issued this year take a generally positive attitude toward DLT. In ""Blockchain Technology and Corporate Governance"" (also published in June), the author — Vedat Akgiray, professor of finance at Bogazici University — focuses on how DLT is likely to make corporate governance more accountable and efficient.""All users on the network can see trading by managers, activists and corporate raiders. Legal insider trading channels are no longer needed. Disguised derivatives hedging, backdating and similar undesirable actions are almost impossible on a blockchain network.""In another working paper from June, ""Blockchain Technology and Its Use in the Public Sector,"" Jamie Berryhill, Théo Bourgery and Angela Hanson — all present or former members of the OECD's Observatory of Public Sector Innovation — argue that blockchain technology has the potential to increase automation, efficiency and knowledge within the public sector. In particular, the authors note ""at least 46 countries around the world have launched or are in the planning stages to launch over 200 blockchain-related initiatives.""This is another encouraging seal of approval for the adoption of DLT — and to further reinforce this point, the authors run through many of the specific areas in which blockchains are witnessing usage, writing:""Just about every area of the public sector could benefit from blockchains in some way.""According to the paper, these areas include identity, privacy, financial services and banking, land title registry, supply chain management and logistics, benefits, public energy utilities, contractor management, voting, copyright, fraud detection, and facilitating interagency operations.The report is perhaps the most positive and encouraging the OECD has produced to date, not least because it was written by employees of the organization — rather than by outside experts who may not reflect its views. In its conclusion, its authors state:""In the future, centralized authorities could become increasingly irrelevant in the context of blockchain technologies, or their role could shift to providing a platform and governance for decentralized services rather than being at the centre of every transaction. It is imperative that the public service builds its knowledge in this area and consider its possible applications and how it may affect its role.""But while such reports find the OECD taking the step of addressing specific areas in which blockchain tech can be applied, two points of caution need to be made. Firstly, these papers are still often written in decidedly general and preliminary terms: The corporate governance report, for example, failed to name any single blockchain that can or could deliver the kinds of benefits it outlined in its conclusion, while none of the above documents attempted to unpack the different types of distributed ledger — e.g., permissionless or permissioned, proof-of-work (PoW) or proof-of-stake (PoS) — and explain which ones might be useful for certain functions. Similarly, the conclusion of the public sector paper offers the familiar reminder that blockchains still need ""to be understood in order to understand the potential solutions to a range of challenges.""Secondly, these reports are also fairly limited in their number, in that only four such papers have been published by the OECD this year, with each handling a limited area of application. And given that the OECD has the power only to issue model tax conventions, policy recommendations and research papers, its reports have no legal weight or official force whatsoever with respect to its member states.However, the beginning of this month marked something of a turning point for how the OECD regards blockchain tech. On Sept. 4 and 5, it held its inaugural Blockchain Policy Forum — which, as the name suggests, had the aim of discussing the best practices and constructive policies related to the use of DLTs. Accordingly, it kicked off with a ‘high-level’ talk on how blockchain tech can be harnessed to produce ‘better policies,’ with OECD Secretary General Angel Gurría providing the opening remarks, in which he stressed the need for international cooperation and alignment on how blockchain technologies are developed, used and regulated.""Blockchain is a tool. And the idea is, to what extent can we make the tool a standard so that, when it is a generally accepted standard, it can then become part of the regulatory process — therefore mandatory in the regulations, so that it can serve the policy purposes better.""Yet, as Gurría quickly made clear, the OECD's enthusiasm for blockchains does not extend so far as believing that DLT is likely to supplant the role of governments and of international institutions such as itself:""But let's not confuse what this is about: Again, the role of government is in setting the policy, and then seeing what they absorb into the regulations, what tools they absorb into the regulations. That is the role of government and it cannot be substituted. But once you [introduce blockchain], once you have it as a standard and you start applying it, then of course it just goes on and on and on. It just keeps giving.""Put differently, the OECD regards blockchain as a technology governments can exploit to improve their efficiency, rather than a technology that might conceivably make governments — or at least certain governmental functions — redundant. Still, even if the vast majority of the speakers and guests at the Forum were united with Angel Gurría on this point, they nonetheless had plenty of encouraging things to say about blockchain tech, with many speakers citing multiple examples of how DLTs are already being used throughout the globe. Similarly, many spoke about how the governments they represent had already taken decisive action to foster the development of the blockchain industry, while some had even worked to nurture cryptocurrencies as well.""Now, with the emergence of distributed ledger technology and digital assets, Bermuda is once again demonstrating its ability to be a center of innovation,"" said David Burt, the Premier of Bermuda, during his speech on Tuesday morning. ""As the first country anywhere to introduce comprehensive ICO and digital asset business legislation, Bermuda aims to be a model for the world […] Over the past nine months, we have delivered the first phase, which includes a robust compliance environment, with bespoke legislation for ICOs, digital asset service providers, and the banking of digital assets in Bermuda. Our legislation is designed to provide clarity, certainty and consistency, with protections for investors, consumers and service providers.""David Burt, the Premier of BermudaSuch positive statements were common, with the prime minister of Serbia, Ana Brnabić, as well as the state secretary of Slovenia, Tadej Slapnik, also explaining to the assembled audience how their respective nations had already begun benefiting from the emergence and harnessing of DLT and crypto. However, as the first day progressed, this initial mood of optimism was tempered with qualifications regarding the limits of what blockchain tech could do, and regarding the legitimacy of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. During a Q&A discussion David Burt said:""The challenge is that there [are] so many people who actually believe that this is a technology that can be used for bad. And the question is how do you change that from a policy perspective, to make sure that it's something that can be used for good? And I think that's the most important thing that can come out of the policy discussions which we're having, is to get us to a place where that mindset can begin to change, and people can start talking about not Bitcoin, but can start talking about the different type of applications that can make lives better.""Despite the general excitement surrounding blockchain tech, this kind of cryptocurrency stigmatization was common. During the ""Blockchain at the Frontier of Trust"" session on the first day, the moderator, President of the Chamber of Digital Commerce Perianne Boring, asked the audience to participate in a poll, in which attendees were asked to respond with the percentage of Bitcoin transactions they believed were ‘illicit.’ As the image below reveals, 57 percent of the audience believed that anything from 1 percent — 25 percent of BTC transactions are for illegal purposes. Meanwhile, 17 percent and 10 percent of the audience went for 25 percent — 50 percent and 50 percent  — 75 percent, respectively. Only 13 percent of the audience went for 1 percent or less, which Boring revealed was the correct answer, indicating the gulf between perception and reality — even among 'enlightened' leaders and experts — when it comes to crypto.Indeed, during the ""Blockchain and Economics: Global Impacts"" speeches, Lord Meghnad Desai — the Emeritus Professor of Economics at the London School of Economics — presented the familiar argument that Bitcoin is not money. In fact, Desai also blamed the cryptocurrency for sowing public confusion and concern with regard to blockchains.""I think calling the very first cryptocurrency 'Bitcoin,' was really very harmful, because it looked like it was money, but it's not money. Money has to be a means of payment, and a unit of account, and a store of value. It is just a store of value. It's not a means of payment; it's a very expensive means of payment, and it's an uncertain store of value. So now that we call [cryptocurrencies] 'tokens,' had originally Bitcoin been called a 'ZenToken,' which I think is my favorite word for Bitcoin, nobody would have bothered, nobody would have had these fears about blockchains and all these specters.""Given this semi-hostility toward Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, it was unsurprising to find that the prevailing definitions of 'the blockchain' largely detached it from the kinds of decentralized ledger on which currencies such as Bitcoin are based.""So there are technical differences, but in general parlance, we generally talk about the blockchain industry as a blanket term that includes distributed ledgers. Blockchains are a subset of distributed ledgers, the key difference being, instead of updating the decentralized ledger transaction by transaction, they do it almost in a batch process […] When people talk about blockchain or they talk about DLT, they really do so, at least in a general business purposes, as [two things] that are synonymous.""Here, R3's MD Charley Cooper underlined how the OECD and many of its invited guests tend to regard permissioned, even largely centralized ledgers as equivalent to decentralized, permissionless blockchains.Even forgetting the overly negative perception of cryptocurrencies at certain points, there was still a general, sober recognition running throughout the Forum that DLT won't be a panacea for the all world's ills. Correspondingly, there was also the recognition that it won't completely live up to some of its unique selling points, such as its ability to create 'trustless' relationships, systems and/or networks.""The ledger itself, or the applications that are built on top of it, allow various types of business activity or other activities to be conducted without a middle person, without a third party,"" explained Charley Cooper. ""That is trustless. However, trust doesn't disappear […] you do need to trust the software and you need to trust the people that built it […] when you, as an entity, are trying to decide whether or not to deploy an application or deploy a blockchain solution within your organization, it's not totally trustless in the sense that you need to be comfortable with the software itself, that it was built appropriately, and that it was built to the specifications that you need for your entity.""Still, while the first day was characterized by a wide-lensed perspective on DLT that regarded it with cautious enthusiasm, the second day saw a higher number of panels and talks that specifically addressed particular applications of blockchains. From health, migration, development, SME financing and water to transport, energy, agriculture and infrastructure, the second day witnessed multiple parallel discussions, and each offered clear examples of how blockchain technology is primed to solve important problems.""We started with 100 people, six months later we had 10,500 people, another six months after that we had over 100,000 people on the system,"" explained Bernhard Kowatsch of the World Food Program, which began an initiative last year to use DLT to process cash-for-food payments to refugees. ""Now, with the 100,000 people that we already have on the system, up until now we have processed more than $23 million through the blockchain system so far. Which means it's no longer a smallish kind of thing; obviously we take this very seriously.""And even though the first-ever Blockchain Policy Forum didn't produce any concrete guidelines or proposals on how businesses, institutions and nations should work with DLT, the fact that it has taken place is an important step for blockchain technology. By providing a platform through which groups and institutions were able to explain how they've successfully used blockchains to improve their operations and services, the OECD has made it much likelier that other groups and institutions will follow in their wake. And with the idea and practice of blockchain spreading, the prospect of positive standards being introduced by the OECD and other governmental — or intergovernmental — organizations moves closer, as does that of increasing blockchain adoption more broadly."

summer. 5015 Total views. 236 ...","Sep 14, 2018","It's no secret that Bitcoin (BTC) mining is an expensive business, and in more ways than one. Not only has it become less profitable since July 2016's halving of mining rewards to 12.5 BTC, but competition among miners and an increasing hashrate have resulted in ever-higher energy consumption, with all the damage to the environment that implies.","Yet, as energy-intensive as Bitcoin mining is, a question still remains: Is there a seasonal variation in the cryptocurrency's energy consumption? Even if consumption is rising on the whole, does something different happen during the summer months?Well, data hasn't been collected on Bitcoin's electricity consumption for long enough to provide a truly authoritative answer to this question, yet what data there is suggests that the summer brings a slight, but noticeable weakening to the rise in BTC's energy consumption. This is most likely because, globally, energy prices increase during the summer months, putting a strain on the profitability of Bitcoin mining.When it comes to the question of Bitcoin's energy consumption, the first thing that needs to be stated is that direct data on consumption hasn’t been made available by the big mining companies. Still, a number of indirect estimations have been produced over the years — based on such metrics as profits, network difficulty and hardware efficiency — and these all show that consumption has been increasing consistently.Back in June 2014, the first rigorous study on BTC energy consumption was published by Karl J. O’Dwyer and David Malone of the National University of Ireland Maynooth. It estimated Bitcoin's annual energy cost to be something between 0.1–10GW (accounting for the uncertainty as to which mining equipment was being used), although the authors settled — though without fully explaining why — on 3GW, which was equivalent to Ireland's yearly consumption level at the time.Since then, the most widely cited data has come from the Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index (BECI). Produced by analyst Alex de Vries, the BECI settled on a higher figure than that of O'Dwyer and Malone's model, and it has continued to reveal steady, day-to-day increases in BTC consumption ever since it started collecting data in February 2017. In December, it put annual consumption at 32TW/h per year — equal to 3.65GW. By contrast, its latest figure — for Sept. 12 — indicates that the Bitcoin network is now eating up 73TW/h — or around 8.8GW – each year. However, in a standalone, peer-reviewed paper from May, de Vries put annual consumption at 2.55GW (22.4TW/h).As the table below illustrates, de Vries' data shows that there have been very few dips during this overall rise. The strong increases continued even during the first half of 2018, when the BTC price saw a considerable correction from its December high of $19,900. For instance, when the price fell by 46.2 percent over three months to the Feb. 17 price of $10,707, BTC's energy consumption increased by 42.6 percent over the same period — from 34.96TW/h to 49.85TW/h. And when BTC's value dropped by 9.87 percent between April and the end of June (to $6,366), its energy consumption rose by 20.9 percent (to 71.1TW/h).This goes to show that, despite the recent ups and downs, BTC's price was high enough to continue driving increased competition among Bitcoin miners, who added capacity to the network in a bid to claim freshly minted coins for themselves. This has had the overall effect of pushing energy consumption ever upward, undermining the sense that there’s any seasonal variation.Marc Bevand — an entrepreneur who has produced his own calculations on BTC energy consumption — largely agrees with this impression.“We don't notice seasonal variations because the network has been growing quite fast, so any — presumably small — seasonal variation is lost in the large amounts of hashrate capacity — and thus energy consumption — being added every month. For example, a year ago, the hashrate was at seven exahash/sec and has grown to 45 exahash/sec today.”However, despite the overall impression that there has been one continuous increase in consumption, some subtle variations are observable in the data that de Vries has collected as part of the Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index.For one, if you calculate the growth in consumption between the 2017 summer months and compare it to the three previous months, you'll see a slackening in the overall rate of increase. For Feb. 10 to May 10 (Feb. 10, 2017 being the first date for which data is available), consumption increased by 33.1 percent:But between June 1 and August 31 (meteorological summer), consumption increased by only 21.9 percent:What's interesting about this is that Bitcoin's price increased by 96 percent between June 1 and August 31, 2017:By comparison, the price increase between the winter months of Feb. 10 and May 10 was 'only' 79 percent:Put simply, BTC's price grew faster over these three summer months of 2017, yet its energy cost grew more slowly.Well, in the three months between June 1 and Aug. 31, BTC energy consumption increased by only 5 percent:Over the same period, BTC's value sank by 6.3 percent. The thing is, its value dropped by a hefty 27 percent between March and May, during which time energy consumption actually increased by 31.6 percent. And between Dec. 1 and February 28, consumption increased by an impressive 69 percent, while the overall BTC value grew by only 7.8% between these three months (although they were big spikes over smaller time frames within this quarter).As with the year before, 2018's movements underline two things: a) that the growth in energy consumption slows down to an appreciable degree in the summer months, and that b) this slowdown can't be correlated with price movements, particularly with regard to 2017's figures. In 2017, energy consumption slowed down while price rises accelerated; in 2018, even though the price had sunk on Aug. 31 relative to its position on June 1, it was still 49 percent higher than it had been on Aug. 31, 2017. Such an annual difference should, in theory, provide a greater incentive for miners to mine Bitcoin and to increase their mining capacities, yet we nonetheless see that they eased up on their growth during the summer months.The fact that BTC's price doesn't fully account for its energy consumption raises a conundrum. However, it's one that's solved via reference to the other biggest factor in Bitcoin's use of electricity, which is the price of electricity itself. On the global level, electricity is generally more expensive in the summer, when there is greater demand for it, both from people turning on their air conditioners and from businesses — including mining farms — needing more energy for cooling.For example, the United States Energy Information Administration — a branch of the U.S. Department of Energy — found in a 2013 review that energy consumption in the U.S. peaks in the summer for residential, commercial and industrial customers, with the variation ranging from 18 billion KW/h to 67 billion KW/h (compared to non-peak times). Similarly, in France and Germany, demand for energy during hot weather in June 2017 caused consumption to rise by 2GW and 4GW respectively. Meanwhile, China — home to some of the largest mining facilities in the world — has been facing the possibility of power shortages this summer, ""as the nation’s distribution networks struggle to cope with soaring temperatures and the fastest power consumption growth in seven years.""RMIT University's Centre for Urban Research explained in a 2017 report on electricity pricing in Australia:""During hot weather, the electricity sector aims to reduce peak electricity demand via ‘price signals’ — higher prices for electricity used at times when many households use air conditioning to cool their homes.""As a single example, the U.S. Energy Information Administration notes in a January bulletin that wholesale electricity prices peaked at $55/MWh in California during August 2017, when they had been only $36/MWh in January of that year — amounting to a 52.7 percent increase.It's therefore clear that electricity demand and pricing tends to increase in summer, particularly on a global level — and particularly in China, where mining is most prevalent. By extension, this would explain why the increase in Bitcoin's energy consumption also tends to level off slightly during the summer, since miners are reacting to increasing costs — and decreasing profitability — by temporarily reducing their capacity, at least in areas affected by hot summers.This finding is backed up by the select few individuals who actually devote themselves to tracking Bitcoin's energy consumption. Speaking to Cointelegraph, Ian Wright, the founder of Power Compare, confirmed that there isn't really any significant or pronounced seasonality in Bitcoin's energy consumption. However, what little seasonality exists is driven by the cost of electricity.""If there is a seasonality effect, it would come down to electricity prices. So, for example, prices may come down in some areas with a lot of installed solar capacity when the sun is shining. Or it may go up in other areas that are hot, as more people turn on AC and increase demand.""Marc Bevand, who doesn’t really see any significant variations in energy consumption, nonetheless also acknowledges that consumption levels are affected by profits.“The energy consumption is driven mostly by increases of the price of Bitcoin. If miners make more profits, they will invest more capital in mining farms.”While he doesn’t explicitly mention electricity here, this assessment is still consistent with the idea that seasonal electricity prices can affect consumption levels, since these prices will inevitably have an impact on profits.This idea is also backed up by a May paper authored by CoinShares Research, in which Christopher Bendiksen and Samuel Gibbons investigated trends in the cost of mining Bitcoin. In particular, their research confirmed that mining companies are significantly influenced by seasonality:""We also note that miner migration and/or price hikes occur during the dry season in China.""Even though this paper didn't describe any mining network reducing capacity, the fact that networks have a tendency to migrate whenever they can would suggest that, when they can't migrate to an area with cheaper electricity, they may simply scale back. As the authors conclude:""Some miners may have felt the squeeze during the market bottom, particularly if they were latecomers in terms of the modernity of their mining gear and/or operate in areas with comparatively higher electricity costs.""While what is above demonstrates that BTC energy consumption is lightly seasonal — in that the increase in capacity slips a little during the summer — there are two caveats worth addressing. The first, which is the less serious, is that the figures produced by Alex de Vries aren't unanimously accepted by all those who track Bitcoin's energy consumption. For instance, entrepreneur Marc Bevand constructed his own model for calculating BTC's energy cost, finding that it was anything between 2.85TWh and 6.78TWh per year. This is considerably lower than de Vries' first estimation of 9.6TW/h (for February 2017), which then grew to 32TWh for December, and then to 73TW/h for this August. It's also lower than the estimation put forward by SetOcean co-founder Oscar LaFarga, who put the annual consumption at around 18.25TW/h.Other commentators have put their estimations even higher than de Vries. However, even with this variation, de Vries recently noted that he used the BECI's methodology to write a peer-reviewed paper — although it produced a lower estimate than that of BECI for overall production. He also notes that a Morgan Stanley report criticized Bevan's approach, which allegedly underestimates the cost of mining networks for cooling, which alone can consume up to 30 percent or 40 percent of a network's revenue. As such, this analysis has stuck with de Vries' figures. What's more, even if they are well into the upper range of possibility, the consistency of the methodology used for the BECI means that this would have little impact on the attempt to specifically follow increases and decreases in BTC's energy consumption over time.The second caveat, which is more significant, is that BTC’s modest seasonality may be weakened even further as the industry matures. Ian Wright says:""[...] the price of Bitcoin relative to electricity prices is increasingly the main driver of consumption and is also driving a shift away from high-cost areas to places with lower prices.""Marc Bevan describes a similar process:“Miners also design their mining farms to run 24/7/365, so seasonal weather patterns don't interrupt their mining operations.”Here, Wright and Bevan are referring in part to the establishment of new mining centers in cooler nations such as Iceland, where Bitcoin mining is on course this year to burn more energy than all of the nation's homes combined. Big mining companies, such as Bitmain, are increasingly flocking to areas with cheaper renewable energy and colder climates, such as Canada.In the process, they'll dilute the vague seasonality currently visible in energy consumption charts, enabling consumption to rise consistently for as long as Bitcoin's price remains high and it retains its onerous proof-of-work (PoW) algorithm. And by doing this, mining firms will also help to reduce the impact Bitcoin is having on the environment. That said, an energy expert at the University of Pittsburgh recently observed that such firms are already making significant use of green energy sources, and that Bitcoin’s overall consumption is still negligible compared to that of the banking industry.But until Bitcoin moves almost completely to renewables, its energy consumption will continue to exhibit some slight seasonality, easing its foot off the gas during the summer months just as the rest of world is doing the opposite. While this subtle decline might seem like a bad thing from the Bitcoin community's perspective, it doesn't appear to have any negative consequences in practice — except for maybe an increase in average confirmation time for transactions in the summer of 2017, something which hasn't been a problem in 2018 due to the rolling out of the SegWit upgrade. In other words, Bitcoin's capacity is growing very steadily, making it easier than ever before to send a transaction to its network and have it accepted."

The report, the fifth edition of Europol’s Internet Organised Crime Threat Assessment (IOCTA) to date, was published yesterday, September 18.","According to Europol, even as Bitcoin’s market share dropped as low as “35 percent in early 2017,” it remained the most “commonly encountered” crypto in cybercrime investigations across the European Union.Europol anticipates that while Bitcoin for now dominates the landscape, anonymity-focused altcoins that offer the protection of “stealth addresses” are likely to gain traction and potentially make “current [crypto] mixing services and tumblers obsolete.”For example, among jihadist networks, Europol found that mass donations in the form of Zcash were popular among those who donated to campaigns in Islamic State (IS)-affiliated websites, although it noted that the use of crypto by terrorist groups has so far been limited to “low-level transactions,” and does not account for a significant share of their funding stream:“Despite the clear potential, none of the attacks carried out on European soil appear to have been funded via cryptocurrencies.”IOCTA outlines a range of crypto-related phenomena on the cybercrime landscape, including cryptojacking, crypto-targeted phishing, and an increasing number of attacks on crypto exchanges or other crypto depositories, which Europol argues are viewed by criminals as a “soft target” in comparison with corporate banks or other traditional institutions.Europol notes that not only exchanges, but “mining services and other wallet holders are facing hacking attempts as well as extortion of personal data and theft.”The report notes that crypto has for several years offered the advantages of a decentralized infrastructure and pseudonymous transactions for laundering criminal proceedings, but suggests that as the large crypto industry players fall under the purview of regulators, decentralized exchanges may soon become a more advantageous channel for launderers.Just today, Cointelegraph reported that a leaked code targeting Microsoft Systems — which hackers allegedly stole from the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) — has sparked a fivefold increase in cryptojacking infections."

An ASIC is tailored for a particular use, rather than for general-purpose use.The Bitfury Clarke ASIC will be sold individually in addition to being integrated into Bitfury’s other BTC mining hardware, including its mining servers and BlockBoxes. Bitfury is planning to implement the new ASIC in its mining centers in Canada, Norway, Iceland and Georgia. The announcement further describes the chip:“The 14nm Bitfury Clarke ASIC is fully customized for SHA256 bitcoin mining. It can execute a hashrate up to 120 gigahashes per second (GH/s) and a power efficiency rate as low as 55 millijoules per gigahash (mJ/GH). The supply voltage required by Bitfury Clarke can be as low as 0.3 volts.”In December, Bitfury facilitated the launch of Toronto-based BTC mining company Hut 8 by providing the company access to mining hardware and other necessities. In July, Hut 8 claimed that it had become the world’s “largest publicly-traded” operator by capacity. The company reportedly mined around 1,900 BTC since its original launch.In July, Cointelegraph also reported that, according to sources from the “upstream supply chain,”  the sale of ASIC crypto mining hardware had been negatively impacted,  with a predicted price drop of 20 percent that month. The affected companies included the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, as well as its integrated circuit (IC) design service partners like Global Unichip.Moreover, the price of specialized graphics processing units (GPUs) had been declining along with sinking prices in digital currency markets. In April, AMD’s OEM 4GB RX 580 six-pack was sold out at the price of $3,600, while in July it was available for $2,500. An Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 Founders Edition, 8GB GDDR5X PCI Express 3.0 Graphics Card was sold out at a price tag of $1,050, but in July could be purchased for $709."

The watchdog planned to discuss the use of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for political contributions and discuss their adoption.The FPPC then held a vote on donations of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin on Thursday, September 20. According to the AP, the members voted 3-1 for the ban, noting that the origin of cryptocurrencies is hard to track and raises questions about transparency.The U.S. Federal Elections Commission generally allows Bitcoin donations to federal candidates. However, several states have banned or restricted such type of contributions — South Carolina has completely banned Bitcoin donations, while Colorado and Montana allow them with restrictions, the AP writes.As Cointelegraph reported back in 2017, California had previously considered banning bitcoin transactions for charity raffles purchase the proposal has not been accepted since then.Cointelegraph previously listed several U.S. politicians who succeeded in raising funds for their political campaigns via crypto. However, some of the campaigns raised questions on transparency and legality of such contributions.For instance, in May 2018, Obama’s former aide on crypto and digital technologies, Brian Forde, was criticized for accepting Bitcoin donations during his campaign for the U.S. House of Representatives. In an ad by Forde’s opponent, Forde’s donors were pictured as “Bitcoin speculators that oppose cracking down on drug deals and human trafficking.” Forde himself considered the comments “wildly inaccurate”."

In addition to jail time, the individual, a local named Xu Xinghua, has reportedly been fined 100,000 yuan (around $14,500).Xinghua is said to have stolen electricity from one of the factories at Kouquan Railway back in November and December 2017 to power his 50 Bitcoin miners and three electric fans around the clock. The document states that five of the mining machines were damaged during this period.As of April 2018, Xinghua is said to have successfully mined 3.2 Bitcoin, earning 120,000 yuan (about $17,400) and running up an electricity bill of 104,000 yuan ($15,000).In addition to imprisonment and a fine, the court has ordered Xinghua to cover the cost of the electricity charges and has confiscated his mining equipment, The Paper reports.Charges of a similar nature are not unprecedented in China. In June, a man in China’s Anhui province was arrested for attempting to steal electricity to fund his reportedly “unprofitable” mining operations. The suspect was said to have stolen 150 megawatt (MW) of power to fuel two hundred computers that he used to mine both Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH) – running a bill of over 6000 yuan ($930) daily.With the country established as a crypto mining superpower due to its abundance of cheap energy and hardware, reports surfaced at the start of this year that Chinese authorities were poised to attempt to quash the industry.A leaked memo from the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) to a top-level government internet finance regulator reportedly stated that Bitcoin miners should make an “orderly exit” from the country due to them sapping “huge amounts of resources and stok[ing] speculation of virtual currencies.”The regulator is said to have subsequently ordered local authorities to wield all available means in their arsenal – including “measures linked to electricity price, land use, tax, and environmental protection” – to pressure miners to cease their operations."

While the kingdom seems to be taking a rather positive approach toward crypto, the Middle East at large has proven to be a difficult region for virtual currencies, as a large chunk of countries there have banned crypto trading. Nevertheless, the Middle East seems to be on its way to become the global blockchain powerhouse: From Dubai to Tel Aviv, the technology is being thoroughly researched and adopted.","The list below is based on thorough news research, but should in no way be considered complete. If you have more detailed information on banks and the crypto relationship in your country, we encourage you to share it in the comment section.Cryptocurrencies legal framework: PlannedWillingness to explore blockchain at state level: YesRegulationBahrain is taking a rather positive approach toward crypto. In September 2017, the Bahrain Central Bank (BCB) announced the creation of a ""Regulatory Sandbox."" Its aim is to facilitate the fintech industry in the country, including Bitcoin and blockchain-related businesses.In June 2018, local media reported that Dubai-based Palmex digital currency exchange was granted an administrative sandbox license by BCB, allegedly becoming “the first and only cryptocurrency exchange in the Middle East and North Africa to receive a regulatory sandbox license.” A Bahrain government official was quoted as saying: “As of now, we recognize cryptocurrency as a commodity that can be traded in the exchanges. We are not considering it as a legal tender in any form.”BlockchainUntil recently, the Bahrain government had not commented on the matter of blockchain per se, instead mentioning it in the broader context of the fintech industry. However, in September, Abdulhussain Mirza, Bahrain’s minister of electricity and water affairs, confirmed the government’s commitment to supporting the technology:“Technologies such as blockchain take us a huge step forward in finding a secure way to facilitate transactions… Blockchain’s ability to protect user’s data is a true mark of progress, especially due to the fact that it can be applied in different companies from different industries including cyber security.”Cryptocurrencies legal framework: PlannedWillingness to explore blockchain at state level: YesRegulationCryptocurrencies appear to be popular in Turkey: According to a recent ING Bank report, a whooping 18 percent of Turkish people own cryptocurrencies compared with the eight percent in the United States. That could be attributed to the rising inflation rate of Turkish lira — indeed, the BTC trade volume in Turkish lira reportedly rose from 327,295 to 759,026 between the week ending on July 7 and the one ending Aug. 11.Following the Venezuelan experiment with Petro, the Turkish government has considered issuing its own state-backed cryptocurrency. In February 2018, Turkey’s Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) deputy chair Ahmet Kenan Tanrikulu revealed a plan to launch a “national Bitcoin” called the ‘Turkcoin,’ as per his 22-page report on regulating the crypto market. Similar plans were also voiced by Turkey’s Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Simse in an interview with CNN Turk. In June, local media reported that ‘Turcoin,’ a separate project advertised by its creators as Turkey’s ‘national’ cryptocurrency, had been outed as a ponzi scheme.Previously, in 2017, Turkish lawmakers opined that Bitcoin was “not compatible” with Islam due to the government being unable to control it. They argued that its “speculative” nature meant that trading it was inappropriate for Muslims, according to a local news outlet Enson Haber:“Buying and selling virtual currencies is not compatible with religion at this time because of the fact that their valuation is open to speculation. They can be easily used in illegal activities like money laundering, and they are not under the state’s audit and surveillance”BlockchainDespite the unclear regulatory environment in regard to cryptocurrencies, Turkey has bolstered its underlying technology. In August, the Istanbul Blockchain and Innovation Center (BlockchainIST Center) was inaugurated at Bahçeşehir University (BAU). The country’s first university-level blockchain center aims to close the blockchain expertise gap and ensure wide deployment of the technology, as Daily Sabah reported.According to the center’s director Bora Erdamar, it is set to be “the most important center of research and development and innovation in Turkey, in which scientific studies and publications are made in blockchain technologies.” He also expressed that Turkey could become the leading country in technology that will “transform humanity.”Most recently, in September, Turkey's Borsa Istanbul Stock Exchange (BIST) developed a blockchain-powered customer database, to manage the addition of new customers, documents and edit information.Cryptocurrencies legal framework: No/Deemed illegalWillingness to explore blockchain at state level: YesRegulationCryptocurrencies are banned in Qatar. In February 2018, the Qatar Central Bank (QCB) published a statement sent to all banks operating in the country, in which it warned the public that trading in Bitcoin is not allowed in the country. The watchdog added that penalties will be imposed on those who fail to comply.Specifically, the QCB argued that Bitcoin was an illegal currency because “there is no commitment from any central bank or a government in the world to exchange their value for money issued and cleared for payment for the goods traded globally or for gold.” It also cited Bitcoin’s volatility as well as involvement in financial crimes and cyber attacks among other reasons.BlockchainDespite that the QCB has prohibited trading cryptocurrencies in the country, Qatar will host a blockchain conference in Doha. Moreover, there are a number of local blockchain-focused startups there: The country considered using the technology after a number of neighboring countries cut ties with it over Qatar’s alleged support of terrorism in 2017.For instance, in January 2018, a local fintech company QPAY launched a blockchain-powered, e-commerce initiative based on Ethereum blockchain platform. Upon the launch, QPAY’s CEO Ben Aissa declared:“As an active member of Qatar’s digital and cashless initiatives, and aligned with the National Vision 2030, we see blockchain as a key ingredient in taking leadership in Qatari digital revolution and financial services innovation.”Cryptocurrencies legal framework: No/Deemed illegalWillingness to explore blockchain at state level: YesRegulationCryptocurrencies are deemed illegal inside the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. On Aug. 8, the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority (SAMA) officially warned citizens against trading virtual currencies, effectively outlawing them. The regulator’s statement read:“The committee assured that virtual currency including, for example, but not limited to, the Bitcoins are illegal in the kingdom and no parties or individuals are licensed for such practices. The committee warns all citizens and residents about drifting after such illusion and get-rich scheme due to the high regulatory, security and market risks involved, not to mention signing of fictitious contracts and the transfer of funds to unknown recipients/entities/parties.”BlockchainSimilarly to Qatar, the local ban on trading cryptocurrencies does not stop Saudi Arabia from experimenting with blockchain within its Saudi Vision 2030 program designed for long-term economic development.For instance, in July, within that program, Riyadh Municipality chose IBM as its strategic partner. The IT giant will collaborate with Elm Company, the municipality's technology partner, to put government services and transactions on the blockchain. Earlier in May, the Saudi Ministry of Communications and Information Technology teamed up with ConsenSys, a U.S.-based startup focused on building Ethereum-powered software products. Jointly, they hosted a three-day blockchain bootcamp.Cryptocurrencies legal framework: PlannedWillingness to explore blockchain at state level: YesRegulationIran, pressed by economic sanctions imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump, is slowly turning to cryptocurrencies. Due to Visa and Mastercard not operating in the country, and the local currency — the rial — plummeting because of high inflation rates, Bitcoin has gained local popularity: In May, local media reported that over $2.5 billion had been sent out to purchase virtual currencies in Iran.Currently, cryptocurrencies are outlawed in Iran. However, the situation might change by the end of September. In April, the Central Bank of Iran (CBI) proclaimed that virtual currencies are used for money laundering and supporting terrorism, and banned local citizens, banks and exchanges from trading them. However, in late August, Saeed Mahdiyoun, the deputy director in charge of drafting regulations for Iran's Supreme Cyberspace Council, declared that the CBI is set to update its official stance on the issue at the end of September.Similarly to Venezuela, Iran is also preparing grounds for a national cryptocurrency to dodge U.S. sanctions. In May, Mohammad-Reza Pour-Ebrahimi, the head of the Iranian Parliamentary Commission for Economic Affairs, reportedly met with Russian officials to discuss how crypto can help bypassing the international embargo. In July, Alireza Daliri, deputy for management and investment at the Directorate for Scientific and Technological Affairs, revealed that plans for the creation of a national virtual currency were being developed:“We are trying to prepare the grounds to use a domestic digital currency in the country...This currency would facilitate the transfer of money (to and from) anywhere in the world. Besides, it can help us at the time of sanctions.”Additionally, in September, the Cyberspace Council’s secretary Abolhassan Firoozabadi stated that the mining of cryptocurrencies had been approved as an industry by government authorities, according to local media. However, a legal framework for the industry is yet to be introduced.BlockchainIranian government seems to be bullish on crypto’s underlying technology. For instance, in August, Iran’s Information and Communications Technology (ICT) ministry and the National Library signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to use blockchain to digitize the country’s archives.Arame Bandari, a researcher at Iran Blockchain Labs, has previously told Cointelegraph that there is a established startup ecosystem in Tehran, Isfahan and Shiraz. Moreover, he mentioned that technology parks, incubators, crowdfunding platforms and business accelerators are being set up, “paving the way for the implementation of a technology/knowledge-based economy.”Cryptocurrencies legal framework: No/Deemed illegalWillingness to explore blockchain at state level: NoRegulationBitcoin is prohibited in Iraq. In December 2017, the Central Bank of Iraq’s (CBI) information director Aysar Jabbar, reportedly stated that “this currency [Bitcoin] involves several risks that may result from circulation, especially with regard to electronic piracy and fraud, although there is no popularity within Iraq.”According to a local economic expert, those found using cryptocurrencies may be prosecuted under pre-existing Anti-Money Laundering (AML) laws.Cryptocurrencies legal framework: No/Deemed IllegalWillingness to explore blockchain at state level: NoRegulationVirtual currencies, including Bitcoin, are banned in Kuwait. In December 2017, Kuwait's Ministry of Finance declared that it does not recognize cryptocurrencies, and that financial institutions, banks and companies are prohibited from dealing with them.However, sources from the Ministry of Finance cited by Arab Times disclosed that neither their institution nor the central bank can regulate Bitcoin trading because it is “out of [their] control."" Additionally, they stated: “...the proceeds of Bitcoin that are wired from abroad to Kuwait are considered as illegal and unclean money, because the Kuwaiti law does not consider those currencies.”BlockchainIn May, the Kuwait Finance House (KFH) joined RippleNet, a major blockchain-powered network designed for cross-border remittance payments. In an accompanying statement, KFH expressed its intention to use Ripple’s “unique tool” for its retail customers:“With this, KFH can provide instant and secure cross-border money transfers within seconds, with end-to-end visibility over the journey of the payment.”Cryptocurrencies legal framework: PlannedWillingness to explore blockchain at state level: YesRegulationThe United Arab Emirates (UAE) government have been sending mixed signals regarding cryptocurrencies: In early October 2017, the state released its first regulatory guidelines for ICOs and virtual currencies, where they have been recognized as securities and commodities respectively.However, few weeks later, Central Bank Governor Mubarak Rashid al-Mansouri issued a public warning against the use of virtual currencies as a medium of exchange, citing money laundering and funding terrorism among the reasons. Further, in February, the UAE Securities and Commodities Authority (SCA) additionally warned investors about the risks of ICOs.BlockchainThe UAE has been experimenting heavily with blockchain. Back in October 2016, Dubai launched a city-wide Blockchain Strategy with the aim of becoming the first blockchain-powered city by 2020.In April 2018, the prime minister of the UAE and ruler of Dubai revealed the nation’s Blockchain Strategy 2021, with similarly ambitious plans to become the world’s first blockchain-powered government. The new scheme will reportedly focus on citizen and resident happiness, government efficiency, legislation and global entrepreneurship.More specifically, the strategy aims to have 50 percent of federal transactions being conducted on blockchain by 2021. That transitions implies moving to paperless documentation of visa applications, bill payments and license renewals with the technology, which could potentially save $11 billion annually.In May 2018, the UAE government announced a partnership with IBM to create a blockchain business registry to ensure businesses operate under its jurisdiction. The initiative will “streamline the process of setting up and operating a business, roll out digital exchange of trade licenses and related documentation for all business activities, and ensure regulatory compliance across Dubai’s business ecosystem,” as per its press release.Cryptocurrencies legal framework: NoWillingness to explore blockchain at state level: YesRegulationIn January 2018, Egypt’s Grand Mufti Shawki Allam famously claimed that Bitcoin is forbidden under Sharia law. He issued a fatwa arguing that crypto trading leads its users to “fraud, betrayal and ignorance.”Egypt’s government does not support the use of cryptocurrencies either, although it hasn’t outlawed them. For instance, in December 2017 Egypt’s Financial Regulatory Authority (FRA) stated that urging investors into dealing with cryptocurrencies is considered a ""form of deception that falls under legal liability,” while the Central Bank of Egypt has reportedly announced that it does not recognize cryptocurrencies and warned the public from trading them.BlockchainIn April 2018, Egypt's first blockchain-focused incubator called NU TechSpace was opened. It has reportedly teamed up with IBM, Novelari, and zk Capital to stimulate blockchain-backed business models. The incubator is also allegedly supported by the state-owned Academy of Scientific Research and Nilepreneurs and aims to help the government gain a better understanding of blockchain.Cryptocurrencies legal framework: NoWillingness to explore blockchain at state level: YesRegulationCryptocurrencies seem to be in a grey regulatory zone in Cyprus, as no definite regulatory frameworks have been introduced by the local government. Back in 2014, the Central Bank of Cyprus representative was quoted by the Cyprus Mail as saying: “Bitcoin is not illegal, but at the same time, neither is it subject to control or regulation.” Since then, the watchdog has not issued any major updates on the issue.Nevertheless, in July 2018, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) advocate Roger Ver claimed he met with nation’s president, Nicos Anastasiades, to discuss benefits of the cryptocurrency and merchant adoption across the island. That implies that Cyprus might become more crypto-friendly in the future.BlockchainIn June, Ripple announced the University Blockchain Research Initiative and donated around $50 million to universities across the planet, including Cyprus’ University of Nicosia (UoN). UoN claims to be the first accredited university in the world to accept Bitcoin payments. It has also launched a Master of Science degree in Digital Currency aimed “to fill an important gap that exists today between the supply of and demand for academic knowledge in the area of digital currency.”Moreover, Cyprus is home to the Cyprus Blockchain Technologies Ltd., a nonprofit organization founded as a collaboration among academic institutions, including Cyprus International Institute of Management (CIIM), University College London Centre for Blockchain Technologies (UCL CBT) and UoN, local regulators, financial institutions and banks — including Hellenic Bank, Bank of Cyprus and Cooperative Bank.Cryptocurrencies legal framework: Planned/TaxWillingness to explore blockchain at state level: YesRegulationIsrael is in the process of defining its approach toward cryptocurrencies. In January 2018, Deputy Governor Nadine Baudot-Trajtenberg announced that Bank of Israel would not recognize virtual currencies as actual currency.Moreover, in March, Israel Securities Authority (ISA) Committee for the Examination and Regulation of ICOs published a report “designed to dispel uncertainty and strike a balance between technological innovation and the protection of the investors,” where it essentially argued that virtual currencies such as BTC are considered securities.Similarly, the Israel Tax Authority (ITA) stated that cryptocurrencies will be taxed by the capital gains as properties instead of currencies.BlockchainCointelegraph has previously covered Israel’s vast blockchain scene in depth: Selva Ozelli, an international tax attorney and CPA, reviewed local blockchain initiatives, including the following: CoaIiChain, an interactive political platform that promotes the policies of an open government and eliminates the communication gap between the elector and the elected; a blockchain drone registry; and a national cryptocurrency.Additionally, in July, Israeli news outlet The Jerusalem Post reported that Czech investment banking firm Benson Oak had plans to pump “around $100 million” into Israel-based startups with an “emphasis” on blockchain, boosting the local scene.Cryptocurrencies legal framework: No/Deemed illegalWillingness to explore blockchain at state level: NoRegulationBitcoin trading is banned in Jordan, as in 2014 the Central Bank of Jordan's (CBJ) warned locals that virtual currencies are not legal tender “and there is no obligation on any central bank in the world or any government to exchange its value for real money issued by them nor backed by underlying international commodities or gold.""Additionally, CBJ’s representative told The Jordan Times that the nation’s banks, financial institutions and exchanges had also received a circular ""prohibiting them from dealing with virtual currencies, particularly in Bitcoins.""BlockchainJordan is home to a refugee camp that runs on blockchain, with the help of a program called Building Blocks. Founded in early 2017, it helps the World Food Programme (WFP) to distribute cash-for-food aid to over 100,000 Syrian refugees in the country. As MIT Technology reports, if the project succeeds, it could advance the adoption of blockchain at sister U.N. agencies and beyond.Cryptocurrencies legal framework: NoWillingness to explore blockchain at state level: YesRegulationIt seems that cryptocurrencies are neither banned nor allowed in Oman. In December 2017, the Central Bank of Oman (CBO) board cautioned the public that they are not responsible for any losses experienced from cryptocurrency investments and reminded that there are no policies or guidelines to regulate the industry in the country.BlockchainOman has been actively showing interest in blockchain. For instance, in May, a government-owned entity called Blockchain Solutions and Services Co. (BSS) was announced. According to its website (unavailable by the press time), BSS is working with the Oman Banks Association, state bodies and local businesses to develop a framework for the nation’s digital advancement.Moreover, the country’s BankDhofar has joined BankChain, an international banking community focused on the research and development of blockchain solutions.Cryptocurrencies legal framework: PlannedWillingness to explore blockchain at state level: NoRegulationIn May 2017, the head of the Palestine Monetary Authority (PMA), Azzam Shawwa, told Reuters that they were planning to launch the country’s own virtual currency called “Palestinian pound” within five years.The initiative was reportedly designed to shield Palestine against potential Israeli intrusion, as the country does not currently have a stable currency — relying on the euro, U.S. dollar, Israeli shekel and Jordanian dinar.According to the 1994 Paris Protocol agreement, the PMA serves as a central bank, but does not have the ability to issue currency. The document also recommended the use of the shekel and gave Israel an effective veto over a Palestinian currency, as Shawwa explained:“If we print currency, to get it into the country you would always need clearance from the Israelis and that could be an obstacle. So that is why we don’t want to go into it.”Cryptocurrencies legal framework: NoWillingness to explore blockchain at state level: NoRegulationIn December 2013, Lebanon became the Middle East’s first country to issue a public warning regarding cryptocurrency trading, citing volatility, AML and KYC concerns among primary factors.In October 2017, Lebanese central bank Banque du Liban (BDL) Governor Riad Salameh reiterated that position by claiming that BTC and other virtual currencies are “unregulated” commodities whose use should be prohibited. Additionally, he said that cryptocurrencies are feeble as national currencies because they are just “commodities.”BlockchainThere is scarce information on existing blockchain infrastructure in Lebanon. However, in September, U.S.-based blockchain startup ConsenSys announced that it would host a five-day blockchain event there starting on Oct. 17."

adopted as stores of value have alternative use cases. Ether operates as ...","Sep 20, 2018","Last week, statements from Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (aka CZ) and Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin led the community to speculate on the possibility of the crypto market achieving a 1,000 return in value in the long-term.","On Sept. 8, Buterin stated with the awareness of cryptocurrencies by the general public and mainstream reaching a peak in late 2017, it is unrealistic for the valuation of the crypto market to increase by a thousand fold from its current value at $200 billion.A thousand fold increase from $200 billion is $200 trillion, which is 70 percent of global wealth that includes gold, reserve currencies, and other traditional assets that are utilized as wealth management products.“The blockchain space is getting to the point where there’s a ceiling in sight. If you talk to the average educated person at this point, they probably have heard of blockchain at least once. There isn’t an opportunity for yet another 1,000-times growth in anything in the space anymore.”Given the context and Buterin’s statement on the growth of awareness of crypto, the claim of the Ethereum co-creator was quite straightforward. While it is possible that decentralized systems and applications (DApps) achieve a thousandfold growth in activity and user base, it is not realistic to expect the valuation of cryptocurrencies to surpass $200 trillion anytime soon.However, sensationalized headlines and out-of-context social media posts misled many members of the cryptocurrency community to misunderstand Buterin’s statement as a pessimistic take on the rate of growth of the cryptocurrency sector.As an increasing number of people began to question Buterin’s motive in his rather simple statement, he released a follow-up explanation on social media, reaffirming that, although he struggles to see the valuation of the crypto market achieving $200 trillion, exponential growth in the usage of DApps and blockchain protocols is possible.“To be clear, I never said that there is ‘no room for growth’ in the crypto ecosystem. I said there is no room for 1000x price increases. A 1000x price increase from today means $200 trillion in crypto, or an entire 70 percent of today's global wealth being in crypto. What I actually said is that, because large portions of the population have already heard of crypto, further growth of crypto in any sense must come from depth (i.e., actual usage) and not bringing in more attention.”The viewpoint of Buterin toward the long-term growth of the cryptocurrency market is sensible, as it would undoubtedly be difficult for cryptocurrencies to represent the vast majority of the world’s wealth. It would require banks operating the $30 trillion offshore banking industry and investors holding wealth in traditional stores of value such as gold to switch to cryptocurrencies as the primary store of value.Instead of expecting an unrealistic return, Buterin noted that it is important to focus on the growth of DApps and protocols to speed up the process of increasing the usage of blockchain-based systems and cryptocurrencies.Currently, most individuals — in both developed cryptocurrency markets, like the U.S. and Japan, and restricted markets, like India and China — are already aware of cryptocurrencies and blockchain protocols. The next phase in blockchain technology might require a shift in the trend from centralized platforms to decentralized alternatives, which could be difficult given the discrepancy in efficiency between centralized and decentralized services.Changpeng Zhao, the CEO of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Binance, better known to the community as CZ, stated that a thousandfold return from the current valuation of the market is “absolutely” possible, offering an extremely optimistic prediction on the future price trend of the market.CZ stated that $200 trillion could seem unrealistically large if compared to the traditional finance market. But, similar to comparing the taxi industry to the market size of Uber, CZ explained that it is not accurate to measure the potential of the crypto market based on the size of the traditional finance market.“I still disagree with this. I will say ‘crypto will absolutely grow 1000x and more!’ Just reaching USD market cap will give it close to 1000x, (that's just one currency with severely restricted use case), and the derivatives market is so much bigger.“You also can't use traditional market size to measure potential for new technologies or industries. If you used (and people have) taxi market size to estimate Uber's potential, you would be off by quite a bit.”There is merit in CZ’s argument that the potential of cryptocurrencies cannot be measured based on the market size of the traditional finance market. But, over the past year, the biggest companies in crypto, such as Coinbase, Gemini and BitGo, have been working to establish custody solutions to bring in institutional investors into the space, while investors have been highly anticipating the debut of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and all sorts of publicly tradable instruments around crypto.Hence, with the majority of investors in the crypto market anticipating an influx of investors from the traditional finance sector, to some extent, investors have to explore the finance market to measure the potential market size of crypto.Moreover, as ShapeShift CEO Erik Voorhees said, global finance is becoming further integrated with crypto finance, and as the cryptocurrency sector continues to create bridges connecting the two markets, both markets will continue to intertwine and affect one another, positive or negatively.As CZ stated, it is also important to acknowledge that money is one application of blockchain technology that is best demonstrated by Bitcoin. Venture capital firms and prominent investors like Ben Horowitz generally consider blockchain technology and smart contract blockchain protocols like Ethereum as new global computing systems.Bitcoin, Ether and other major cryptocurrencies that have started to be adopted as stores of value have alternative use cases. Ether operates as gas that fuels the Ethereum smart contract blockchain protocol, which — with sufficient scaling through the implementation of sharding and Plasma — could compete against centralized web servers and computing platforms in the long term.The ability of blockchain technology to operate as a computing system on top of a form of money could add more value and, as CZ said, in the sense that blockchain technology is not limited to money, it can be argued that the comparison between crypto and the finance sector represents only one aspect of the market.Garry Tan, a prominent venture capitalist and the earliest investor in Coinbase and Instacart, who has funded more than 100 startups worth $20 billion, said that it is possible for the crypto market to reach hundreds of trillions of dollars in market valuation.While a thousandfold return is difficult to imagine, Tan stated that the possibility of explosive growth in the cryptocurrency sector cannot be ruled out. He emphasized that the crypto market will not undergo the trend most speculators in the industry expect. Tan told Cointelegraph:“My general sense is that it is possible but unlikely to be 1000x. Even if it did get there, you would be assuming securitization using security tokens, which isn’t exactly what speculators have in mind when they are hoping for more 1000x situations. They are generally thinking that their worthless altcoins will somehow be worth 1000x and security tokens will merely represent ownership in real assets. It’s a strange nuance but one worth mentioning.”Still, after nine years, Tan stated that the cryptocurrency market is mostly dominated by retail investors and individual traders. A significant amount of capital is controlled by institutions and the entrance of institutional investors — like pensions, endowments and sovereign wealth funds — could very well lead to an explosive increase in the valuation of crypto.For institutional investors to commit to an asset, say Bitcoin, a specific type of infrastructure is required to facilitate the transfer of funds. Custody solutions in the crypto market have not existed for more than two months, with the first trusted custodian solution released by Coinbase in July.Hence, it could take months to years for institutional investors to commit to the crypto market. But, echoing the viewpoint of billionaire investor Mike Novogratz, Tan stated that once institutions find their way into crypto, the market will see a difference in terms of volume and value, as Novogratz previously said:“I think if you start seeing institutional LPs [limited partnerships] — like endowments, foundations, pension plans and sovereign wealth funds put capital into cryptocurrencies — you will see a tipping point where a percentage of world wealth starts flowing in. We are at the very earliest stages of that. Novogratz talks about the hordes coming, and I think that is correct. Crypto is still extremely driven by retail investors, but it’s staggering how much money is locked up in institutions.”As seen in the graph below, the volume of the crypto market experienced a large spike in late 2017, as the prices of cryptocurrencies peaked at all-time highs.But, over the past few months, the volume of the crypto market has started to recover, after experiencing a dip in March and April. In July, the volume of Bitcoin declined to sub 500,000 BTC but since August, apart from the first week of September, the volume of the crypto market has generally been improving.Generally, crypto is still in its early phases of development, like the internet in 1994. Institutions are just preparing to get involved and infrastructures of the market have only started to improve rapidly since mid-2017. As such, it is too early to discuss the possibility of crypto competing against reserve currencies and central banks. Tan stated that the next 18 months could be crucial for crypto, as it will define the long-term trajectory of the market, adding:“Central banks are a whole other level, and I don’t really know if and when they might decide it is something they [will] use as a reserve currency. That would be super far in the future, [in] my sense. We need to go from [the] infrastructure phase to [the] application phase, and I think that is the main story for the next 18 months. It’s still the internet in 1994.”In June, Novogratz stated that the crypto market will feel like a bubble once it reaches $20 trillion, after experiencing a hundredfold increase from the current price range.At the time, Novogratz explained that the next rally of crypto will be fueled by institutions entering the crypto market, triggering FOMO (fear of missing out) among other institutional investors.“[Cryptocurrency] is a global revolution. The internet bubble was only a U.S. thing. It was rich U.S. people participating. [Cryptocurrency] is global. There are kids in Bangladesh buying coins. It is monstrous in Tokyo, in South Korea, in China, in India and in Russia. We’ve got a global market and a global mania. This will feel like a bubble when we’re at $20 trillion.”Over the past month, as Cointelegraph reported, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs — three of the largest investment banks in the U.S. — have publicly released their plans to facilitate growing demand for Bitcoin from institutional investors.Morgan Stanley is said to have already established a system to process funds coming from the traditional finance sector into the crypto market and is currently awaiting an internal procedure to launch its crypto custody.Novogratz stated:“It won’t go there [$20 trillion] right away. What is going to happen is, one of these intrepid pension funds — somebody who is a market leader — is going to say, ‘You know what? we’ve got custody, Goldman Sachs is involved, [and] Bloomberg has an index I can track my performance against,’ and they’re going to buy. And all of the sudden, the second guy buys. The same FOMO that you saw in retail [will be demonstrated by institutional investors].”The deployment of crypto custodian solutions by regulated financial institutions and strengthening infrastructure around crypto will increase the probability of institutional investors committing to cryptocurrencies, which may increase the chances of the crypto market potentially achieving hundreds of trillions of dollars in valuation."

Korea had attempted to mine Bitcoin between May and July 2017.","Sep 26, 2018","North Korea is ""increasingly"" using cryptocurrencies to evade sanctions imposed by the U.S., according to two Washington-based experts cited by news site Asia Times on September 24.","Lourdes Miranda and Ross Delston sent a joint response to an Asia Times' inquiry regarding the use of crypto by the government of North Korea (DPRK). Miranda is an independent financial analyst and a financial crimes investigator, and Delston is an independent attorney and expert witness in money laundering cases.Both experts have claimed that the country is successfully trading existing cryptocurrencies, and is attempting to create one of its own, despite current restrictions imposed on fiat assets:""International criminals everywhere prefer crypto-currencies and the DPRK is no exception. Crypto-currencies have the added advantage to the DPRK of giving them more ways to circumvent U.S. sanctions. They can do so by using multiple international exchangers, mixing and shifting services — mirroring the money laundering cycle.""Miranda and Delston further explain the scheme that they allege is in use by North Korean authorities.Initially, the government hires people who have convenient personal identifiable information (PII) to open a crypto wallet that can be used to trade cryptocurrencies. Then local miners transfer crypto into ""multiple"" European wallets, where they are mixed and shifted in order to confuse anti-money laundering and know-your-customer (AML/KYC) systems.The process ends with North Korean nominees buying bitcoins, which are later converted into other popular cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum or Litecoin, to break the ""linear pattern of transactions.""As the crypto asset’s point of origin is concealed, the North Korean government then has a chance to exchange ""laundered"" coins to fiat, thus receiving dollars without any sanctions attached, the experts concluded.Miranda and Delston did not specify the approximate volume of the operations they described, nor did they reveal the source of their information.As Cointelegraph reported in August, an earlier report by a South Korean bank revealed that North Korea had attempted to mine Bitcoin between May and July 2017. However, the test was then reported as unsuccessful. The report also contained data on attempts to create a North Korean crypto exchange.Countries pressed by U.S. economic sanctions are often reported as experimenting with crypto. For instance, Venezuela launched its controversial ""oil-backed"" Petro coin, which some experts claim barely exists.Iran is reportedly preparing to create its own national cryptocurrency, which is expected to facilitate international transactions for the country sanctioned by the U.S. for launching a national nuclear program, among other things."

At this point, flights and hotels all around the world can be booked with Bitcoin (BTC). Still, some cities are more ready to accept your BTC — and major altcoins — than others, depending on the local infrastructure and crypto-related policies.","According to data from Coinmap, currently there are around 13,150 venues, shops and ATMs supporting Bitcoin on the planet, and that number has been unhesitatingly growing since late 2013.However, as Gili Gershonok, a crypto nomad who deliberately chooses not to have a bank account, told Cointelegraph, ignoring fiat money while travelling becomes more difficult, as all of the crypto prepaid cards she heavily relied on were canceled in early 2018.“I feel like more and more barriers are being set against folks who dare to have a lifestyle that's off the financial grid… The process of going crypto-to-cash is getting more complicated, especially for those who prefer to keep their privacy and avoid high fees — both highly prioritized values across the crypto community.”All of that being said, Gershonok reassured that traveling with BTC is still possible, drawing a parallel between crypto and casual tourists:“I don't think there's a huge difference in the financial behaviors of [the two]. In Prague, I mostly keep to cash, which I can easily withdraw out of one of many crypto ATMs across the city. I try to find crypto payment options for online transactions and as the cliché goes, for everything else — there's plastic.”Gershonok advises those who want to try traveling fiat-free for themselves to start with their current location, and keep security in mind:“Go crypto for a week in your hometown and see what questions and challenges you come across. It would also be advisable to consider some security scenarios, like, what you would do if your phone, laptop, luggage are lost or stolen — and have contingencies in place.”As the end of the summer nears, here are some of the most crypto-friendly destinations that might be worth trying.InfrastructureHome to SatoshiLabs, the manufacturer of the Trezor hardware wallet, Prague hosts the most BTC-accepting venues in the world, as per Coinmap data. There, Bitcoin can be used for renting apartments, paying for food and drinks in various bars and restaurants, or even visiting a crypto-friendly cinema. Gershonok confirms that Prague is one of the most comfortable cities for virtual currencies, naming it her personal favorite:“Businesses with crypto POS and ATMs are not everything [there]. Prague also has a really well-informed, well-connected and active crypto community. I feel like there's more people here who casually know about cryptocurrencies and blockchain basics than in other places I've visited.”PoliciesAt state level, the Czech Republic leans toward a liberal approach to cryptocurrencies. In 2017, the local central bank declared that virtual currencies don’t represent a threat to the conventional banking system via an announcement dubbed “Don’t be afraid of Bitcoin.” In it, the watchdog argued that fiat currencies are still most suitable for commerce, and the traditional monetary system can’t be marginalized by cryptocurrencies because of crypto’s volatility.However, by the end of 2017, the Finance Ministry introduced an Anti-Money Laundering  (AML) law partly restricting BTC. The bill requires local crypto exchanges to reveal the identity of customers so that they will no longer be able to “hide behind fake names or nicknames.”InfrastructureWhile Ljubljana does not necessarily come to mind when thinking of most crypto-advanced cities, the capital of Slovenia hosts a ‘Bitcoin city’, aptly named BTC city, inside itself — a complex with 500 retail stores spread across 475,000 square meters. A special cryptocurrency transaction system called Elipay is set to be integrated into BTC City after a testing round. Nevertheless, a number of cafes, a water park, sneaker shops, etc., have already begun accepting cryptocurrencies. The prime minister of Slovenia, Dr. Miro Cerar, has reportedly visited and encouraged the concept of BTC City, which also hosts the nation’s largest mining rig. Additionally, there are about 20 BTC-accepting venues in Ljubljana’s city center, according to Coinmap.PoliciesThere’s no clear regulation for cryptocurrencies in Slovenia at the moment. In 2017, however, the Slovenian Financial Stability Board issued a warning to Slovenians, advising them to be cautious when investing in ICOs and digital currencies, as there are no laws policing those areas.Nevertheless, local government is clearly interested in blockchain. In October 2017, the government of Slovenia announced its plans to position the country as the leading destination of blockchain technology in the European Union, while also studying the potential applications of the technology in public administration.InfrastructureIn April 2018, the Caribbean Tourism Organization (CTO) teamed up with Barbados-based blockchain startup Bitt Inc. to facilitate “the implementation of more efficient payment processes for tourism-related products and services.” Essentially, CTO wants to explore how cryptocurrencies can improve the local tourist industry, which is one of the main sources of income in the Caribbean, especially after large U.S. banks started to withdraw capital from the region due to the 'de-risking' policy. Hugh Riley, the CTO’s secretary general, told local media:“The Caribbean aims to fully examine the advantages offered by new financial technology… In particular, blockchain financial services have the potential to advance the objectives of specific programs and activities within the tourism sector. The CTO has a responsibility on behalf of our members to fully explore those possibilities.”While the actual outcome of that collaboration is still intangible, if the Caribbean continues to move in that direction, local beaches might attract an array of crypto entrepreneurs willing to spend their savings there.Policies Caribbean countries are approaching crypto adoption at the state level as well. In March, the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB) announced a national cryptocurrency called the Digital Eastern Caribbean Dollar (DXCD), which is planned to be introduced alongside fiat money in eight Eastern Caribbean countries. Donaldson Romeo, premier of Montserrat, declared earlier this year:“The decision to move closer to a cashless society is in keeping with our overall development strategy, and also that of the ECCB.”InfrastructureAmsterdam is one of the pioneering cities in terms of virtual currencies. It famously houses the Bitcoin Embassy, a community hub nearby the local sex museum where crypto enthusiasts gather to attend and organize workshops or do social networking in the local cafe. Additionally, there are about 40 more BTC-friendly venues, including a bike rental, among others. The annual Bitfilm festival dedicated to all things crypto has also been hosted there.PoliciesIn March, a Dutch court categorized Bitcoin as a “transferable value” after the court ruled in favor of a plaintiff who was owed 0.591 BTC.In May, the government issued a report which considered cryptocurrency to be broadly “low risk” in relation to financial stability. However, soon after, the Netherlands Authority for the Financial Markets (AFM) questioned whether entities dealing in cryptocurrency had conformed to licensing laws, due to the high risks being involved.InfrastructureCoinmap shows that there are around 80 crypto-friendly businesses in Tokyo, one of the largest amounts on the planet. For instance, popular conveyor-belt sushi restaurant Numazuko accepts cryptocurrencies, as well as Hackers Bar which hosts live programming sessions, not to count a number of crypto ATMs.PoliciesSuch openness in regard to cryptocurrencies comes as no surprise considering that Bitcoin and altcoins can be used as a legally-accepted means of payment in Japan. Local watchdogs regulate the industry via thorough AML and Know Your Customer (KYC) compliance checks, while the Japan’s self-regulatory crypto exchange body makes sure to cooperate with the state.InfrastructureBitcoin’s popularity in Germany’s capital was highlighted by The Guardian in 2013, back when mainstream culture was dismissing the digital currency as solely a crypto-anarchic tool. In Berlin, Bitcoin can be used not only to drink and eat at local bars and restaurants (more than 50 within the city center area accept crypto), but for more sophisticated things as well — for instance, the European School of Management and Technology located in Berlin has been accepting BTC as a means of payment since December 2016.PoliciesCryptocurrencies are not legal tender in Germany, but they have been recognized as ‘private money’ by the German Finance Ministry since 2013. Interestingly, according to the German Income Tax Act, if investors hold their assets (cryptos) for more than one year, their coins become fully tax exempt, making Germany extra attractive to hodlers.InfrastructureWhile Zug may be not as well equipped for usual BTC-financed tourist activities as other cities on the list, it nonetheless represents a historical city for crypto enthusiasts. Proudly championing the title of “Crypto Valley,” Zug is home to numerous blockchain startups. Cryptocurrencies can be used for municipal-related activities, such as paying rent or even registering a company.PoliciesIn Switzerland, “cryptocurrencies are neither money nor a foreign currency, nor a financial supply for goods and services tax (GST) purposes.” Its unclear legal status, however, does not prevent the government from experimenting with blockchain, like using the technology for municipal voting, for instance.InfrastructureAs soon as you get to Malta, head over to the Bitcoin & Auto Trader located in Qormi to claim your obligatory Lambo with your crypto savings — granted, assuming that you’ve got enough coins, obviously. After that, you can drive to a crypto-friendly sushi restaurant to celebrate the new purchase. While the local infrastructure for BTC use is still somewhat immature, the situation might change soon after more positive regulations are introduced — and there are reasons to suspect they are coming.PoliciesIn March, the largest crypto exchange in the world, Binance, announced it was moving its headquarters to Malta. In response, Malta’s prime minister, Joseph Muscat, revealed the island’s plan to become the “global trailblazers in the regulation of blockchain-based businesses.”On July 4, the local government passed three laws that allow companies to issue new cryptocurrencies and trade the existing ones. Most importantly, on that day, Malta became the first country in the world to provide a coherent regulatory framework in the field of blockchain. This week, it continued its path to become the ‘blockchain island,’ as the University of Malta announced a €300,000 blockchain and distributed ledger technology (DLT) scholarship fund in conjunction with the Malta Information Technology Agency (MITA).InfrastructureSan Francisco boasts around 120 crypto-friendly venues, being an internationally-recognized hub for crypto evangelists. There’s the famous Crypto Castle, a mecca for crypto traders dreaming to multiply their investments and join the ranks of crypto millionaires, as well as numerous BTC-accepting businesses. In fact, San Francisco is so advanced in terms of crypto that even a local federal court accepts bail bonds paid in BTC.PoliciesCryptocurrencies are still in an unclear regulatory zone in the U.S., despite being watched by various regulators like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), who define digital currencies depending on their purview. Nevertheless, the U.S. has been crafting a blueprint for crypto regulations, granting the rights to trade BTC futures and issuing a special trading license in New York.InfrastructureBuenos Aires has been unofficially named the capital of Bitcoin in Latin America. It boasts a surprising amount of crypto businesses — around 140, as per Coinmap — being up in the top three along San Francisco and Prague. According to a local crypto-related media outlet, Buenos Aires has a Bitcoin publishing house and a taxi service among businesses accepting BTC. Moreover, individual professionals like photographers, professors, designers, technicians and psychologists have reportedly been accepting crypto for their services there.PoliciesBitcoin’s success in Argentina could be attributed to the inflation of the national currency and manipulated exchange rates — those economic problems led some citizens to decentralized currencies.The governor of Argentina’s central bank was responsible for proposing the July 2018 deadline for regulatory proposals at the G20 summit in March — however, the date has been postponed until at least October."

Bubble has indeed become a shibboleth for crypto sceptics, especially after the market soared at the end of 2017, and the widening gap between valuation and intrinsic value of digital currencies and tokens became ostensible to many.","Yet not all bubbles are created equal: some bubble-framed references and metaphors tend to surface more frequently in media space than others. Perhaps the crypto’s most conspicuous historical analogy is the dot-com bubble of the early 2000-s – and quite understandably so. There is almost irresistible temptation to draw parallels between the burst of the booming market that emerged around early applications of a disruptive communication technology, and the highly volatile market that emerged around the blockchain ecosystem.The recent slump in crypto prices has only made face similarities more pronounced. As Bloomberg reported earlier this week, VanEck’s MVIS CryptoCompare Digital Assets 10 Index, which tracks the prices of top ten digital assets, went down 80 percent compared to its January high. Symbolically, this development is now more dramatic than the Nasdaq Composite Index’s 78 percent nosedive at the height of the dot-com crash. The overall market cap dipped below $200 billion, shrinking by a factor of more than three from the all-time high. Does this mean that crypto market is doomed to follow the pattern of the early internet boom’s infamous explosion?In the simplest terms, market bubbles occur when assets are traded at prices that by far exceed their fundamental value. Even though this can happen in virtually every market, tech industries, widely construed, are especially prone to such dynamics. Perhaps this is due to the human tendency to get excited over potentially disruptive technologies and then engage in speculative behavior fueled by this excitement. The technology in question does not necessarily have to be a digital one – the British ‘railway mania’ of the mid-19th century could serve as a good example of an ‘analog’ bubble.The mid to late 1990s saw the rapid growth of internet-powered consumer markets. Sensing the ‘next big thing,’ entrepreneurs and investors flocked into the space, inflating each other’s ardor along with valuation of internet startups, which sprouted prolifically in the bull market. At the time, adding .com to a company’s name did the same to its stock as adding ‘blockchain’ does today. The Nasdaq Composite stock market index was the one that tracked many of those technology companies, and it was doing great – until a certain moment. At its peak in March 2000, the index reached the value of $6 trillion. A few years before, then-Chairman of the Fed Alan Greenspan famously observed that ‘irrational exuberance’ tends to ‘unduly escalate asset values.’ Once the dot-com bandwagon headed steeply downhill, the term ‘irrational exuberance’ entered just about every analytical reflection on what has happened.The bubble burst. Expectations were set too high, the market was too overheated, and many of the dotcoms proved unable to come up with sustainable business models, let alone deliver services worth anything comparable to what investors poured on them.  In less than two years, more than half of the companies folded, while trillions of dollars of investors’ money just vanished. As the widespread narrative goes, the explosion of the dot-com bubble helped weed out numerous opportunistic players, thus clearing the way for those serious companies that had authentic ideas and a truly clairvoyant vision – today’s giants like Amazon and Apple usually among the primary examples. Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin famously characterized these events as ‘creative destruction’ and, along with many others, pointed out that the crypto market might be following the same trajectory.Indeed, the dot-com bubble and the hypothetical crypto bubble share many striking commonalities, from powerful waves of irrational exuberance fueling their explosive growth to grandiose disruptive promise of their underlying technologies to trend lines describing the dynamics of their capitalization. As per Morgan Stanley’s March report, cryptocurrency price chart is broadly mirroring the Nasdaq index chart from the turn of the century; the number of bear cycles and rebounds, as well as their depth, are largely similar, as are the regularities in trading volumes. Some other very smart people have independently reached similar conclusions by using fancy statistical techniques to compare those two sets of data points. So, is it warranted that the painful burst is what invariably awaits us all? Or has it already happened in January, meaning that we are now living through the gloomy days of decay akin to the dot-com post-wreck 2001? The unsatisfying answer is that we cannot know for sure.One thing to bear in mind is a number of important features that are still different between the two sets of circumstances. The most obvious one to look at is the size of the market, even though the relevance of this metric is debatable: whereas the Nasdaq Composite index amounted to six trillion dollars on its brightest day, the crypto market’s high-water mark is around half a trillion. At least we can rest assured that the damage to the overall economy in the case of collapse would be less dramatic than eighteen years ago.A more consequential variable might be the pace at which the markets move. According to the same analysis by Morgan Stanley, in blockchain industry things happen 15 times faster than in the early internet sector. This is a product of a number of important distinctions between the two cases. One is that thanks to Twitter, Reddit, and Telegram, the information environment around crypto markets is richer, more transparent and more responsive to relevant (and not-so-relevant, for that matter) signals. Another point is that, unlike dot-com startups that were mainly supported by venture capital flowing from institutional actors, crypto markets rely on millions of retail investors globally a good deal. In sum, the ‘crypto bubble’ is a more diverse constellation of actors who have a wealth of information about the market, which is arguably more distributed geographically than any other. This looks like a set of structural differences that could yield outcomes that are different from what the story of dot-coms would predict.In his thoughtful analysis published on Hacker Noon during the first downward tide of the year, Noam Levenson argues that the digital asset market has not yet reached the levels of adoption and capitalization needed for a proper ‘popping.’ Moreover, the dot-com-like crash might not even take place at all, and instead crypto markets would just bounce between bear and bull cycles until widespread adoption helps them entrench in a less volatile territory. The point is, we might well be past the crash, or simply in another loop of bear market on our way to the new heights. It is impossible to assert one or another with confidence, since there is only so much that can be learnt and extrapolated from the dot-com case – a case that is somewhat similar but not identical to the current state of the crypto market.Ultimately, whether digital assets are a bubble or not is no more than a debate over terminology. Even within the crypto community, it is clear to the majority that the present-day tangible output that blockchain-based ventures can offer lags far behind the figures observed at the home page of coinmarketcap.com. It is also clear that these two values will have to realign at some point, similar to how it eventually unfolded with internet companies. The right questions to ask are what the timeline will be, and what the resultant configuration of the industry will look like; what share of today’s players will survive and which ones will eventually make it to the status of Amazons and Googles of the blockchain industries of the future; whether the industry will progress through a devastating crash or a relatively soft landing.According to a radical viewpoint, nearly every market is a bubble, and a market’s progression is just a sequence of inflations and pops. The general sentiment among crypto stakeholders seems to be that the price drop is unavoidable at some point, and many of the less viable projects will have to go. Further still, even the stock market frenzy around potentially disruptive technologies might be viewed as an unlikely means of accomplishing a greater good, opening up the floodgates of capital for industries would otherwise seem too novel and risky: “Nothing important has ever been built without irrational exuberance.”"

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.","Historically, over the past nine years, Bitcoin (BTC) has experienced four major corrections, all of which led Bitcoin to decline by more than 80 percent in value. The correction the crypto market experienced in 2018 resulted in a 69 percent drop in the price of Bitcoin, with some other cryptocurrencies like Binance Coin (BNB) and EOS recording smaller losses.In August 2010, August 2011, January 2014, and January 2018, Bitcoin demonstrated 70 to 80 percent losses against the US dollar.As Cointelegraph previously reported, according to researchers at Chainalysis, the Bitcoin market has matured throughout the past nine months. Despite a steep decline in the price of Bitcoin, the majority of investors held on to their investments, minimizing alterations in their positions even during a period of uncertainty and extreme volatility.“The market seems to have recalibrated after the entry of so many new market participants with different beliefs and expectations than those who held Bitcoin prior to 2017. Neither long-term investors nor new speculators have changed their positions much this summer. This suggests that the market will make a major move, for better or worse, only in response to a fundamental change.”The maturity of the Bitcoin market has been evident in the stability of BTC since Aug. 6. Over the past two months, Bitcoin has remained stable in the $6,300 to $6,800 range, rarely breaking out of the $6,800 resistance level, while other cryptocurrencies like Ripple and Ethereum demonstrated high volatility.Image source: coin360.ioWithin the two-month period, Bitcoin dropped nine percent of its market valuation while Ethereum and Ripple recorded 50 percent corrections, which ultimately led both XRP, the native cryptocurrency of Ripple, and ETH, the base currency of Ethereum, to surge in the second half of September.The increase in the stability of Bitcoin has allowed the market to become less sensitive to hype and specific events. Major positive developments in the cryptocurrency sector — such as the formation of Bakkt by Microsoft, Starbucks and ICE to improve the accessibility and liquidity of Bitcoin — barely had any impact on the short-term price trend of Bitcoin.Experts including ShapeShift CEO Erik Voorhees, billionaire investor Mike Novogratz, legendary venture capitalist Ben Horowitz and Coinbase Chief Technology Officer Balaji Srinivasan believe that the crypto market will recover in the months to come.On CNBC’s “Crypto Trader,” popular cryptocurrency trading platform ShapeShift CEO Erik Voorhees stated that the bear market of Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies is gradually coming to an end.Voorhees explained that, while the bear market is not completely over — given the 80 percent drop in the valuation of the crypto market — the market seems to have recovered from the worst part of the correction.“I don’t expect it [the bear market] to end soon, although I do think that the rate of collapse has slowed considerably. Generally in these bubbles, after you go through several months of a downtrend, you hang out in a range for a while […] But I think we are done with a majority of the collapse.”ShapeShift CEO Erik VoorheesThe analysis of the cryptocurrency market by Voorhees accurately described the current state of the market. Since June, the crypto market has been engaged in a bottoming-out process, maintaining tight support levels at the low level of $190 billion and attempting to break out of the $220 to $230 billion range.For instance, on Sept. 25, the price of Bitcoin Cash (BCH) hovered around $420. As of Sept. 26, the price of BCH remains above $540, up more than 20 percent on the day. As such, Voorhees noted that it is a viable time to start accumulating crypto, because the market has been volatile in its low price range.Several cryptocurrencies, including Cardano (ADA), XRP and Stellar (XLM), have demonstrated similar volatility on the upside, recording 10 to 30 percent gains within short periods of time. In the months to come, it is likely that the crypto market will continue to recover gradually but experience large temporary spikes.The trend of Bitcoin, the most dominant cryptocurrency in the market, has been fairly predictable. Since February of this year, Bitcoin has experienced a pattern of achieving a new monthly high and dropping to a yearly low the subsequent month. The gap between the monthly high and the yearly low declined as time passed, as portrayed by the graph of Bitcoin below.Image source: CoinMarketCapIn early February, Bitcoin dropped to $6,000 but rebounded to $10,000 the next month. In April, Bitcoin dropped to a yearly low once again at $6,000, only to rebound to $9,400 the next month. But, the gap between the yearly low and the monthly high declined. In the next month, June, the price of Bitcoin predictably dropped to $6,000, achieving $8,400 the following month.In August, Bitcoin dropped to $6,000 once again, attempted a recovery to $8,000 but failed and remained in the mid-$7,000 region. Since hitting $7,000, Bitcoin has dropped to the lower region of $6,000.It is obvious that the Bitcoin market has been bottoming out in the mid-$6,000 region, after major attempts to break out of resistance levels at $10,000, $8,000, and $6,000. Each time a resistance level was tested, the strength of a short-term rally decreased, disallowing the dominant cryptocurrency to test higher resistance levels.Billionaire investor Mike Novogratz stated that the market has started to demonstrate signs of seller fatigue, as bears have started to become uncomfortable selling cryptocurrencies at such a low price range. Novogratz emphasized that the cryptocurrency market has bottomed out based on various technical indicators.“I think we put in a low yesterday. Retouched the highs of late last year and the point of acceleration that led to the massive rally/bubble. Markets like to retrace to the breakout. We retraced the whole of the bubble.”Mike NovogratzThroughout 2017, especially as the crypto market achieved an all-time high at $800 billion, talks around the potential entrance of institutional investors intensified. However, in hindsight, the large rally of the crypto market late last year was quite clearly triggered by a new wave of interest demonstrated by retail traders and individual investors globally.In regions like South Korea and Japan, the interest and demand toward cryptocurrencies increased to a point at which exchanges no longer had supplies of cryptocurrencies to sell to buyers, leading to the emergence of premiums.When the price of Bitcoin achieved an all-time high of $20,000, the price of Bitcoin surpassed $24,000 in South Korea’s cryptocurrency exchange market.Even if institutions were interested in investing in the cryptocurrency market, Kyle Samani, a general partner at Multicoin Capital, stated that trusted custodian solutions were not in place and the lack of infrastructure prevented institutions from committing to the asset class. He said:“There are many investors where custody is the last barrier. Over the next year, the market will realize that safekeeping is a solved problem. This will release a large capital wave.”Ari Paul, the co-founder of large-scale cryptocurrency hedge fund Block Tower, echoed the sentiment of Samani and stated:“Custody isn't binary. It's not like Coinbase Custody will launch and suddenly every pension will throw $100 million into BTC. It takes time for custody solutions to gain trustworthiness. But, I think we'll have solid third-party custody by September of this year. That will allow institutional inflows to start accelerating. Once a couple big traditional money managers announce that they're including BTC as ‘digital gold’ in their portfolios, others will follow.”With BitGo and Coinbase already approved as trusted Bitcoin custodians in the United States market and major banks Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley preparing to serve customers in the crypto market, Novogratz explained that in the upcoming months, institutions will enter the market.Once Bitcoin surpasses major resistance levels at $8,800 and $10,000, Novogratz stated that in three to six months, institutions will begin allocating their capital into the market.“It’s also a bull market in institutions building the infrastructure needed for real money investors to start investing in this space […] I think that in three to six months from now, there will be an ‘all clear’ sign for people — big institutions and pension [funds] — to start investing.”If institutions do enter the crypto market, Novogratz emphasized that the price of Bitcoin will likely achieve a 30 percent increase by the end of 2018.According to Coinbase Chief Technology Officer Balaji Srinivasan, he first gained significant confidence in Bitcoin and the crypto market after it survived the 2011 crash. The resilience of the crypto market and its ability to bounce back from large corrections demonstrated the market’s potential to investors.The 2018 correction had a similar impact on the market. Although many investors were negatively impacted by the 69 percent drop in the price of Bitcoin, in the past eight months, the market has seen some of the most positive news in all of its history.Starting with Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley developing trusted crypto custodian solutions, Bakkt, Nasdaq and many other regulated financial institutions in Japan and South Korea have started to find ways to support the crypto market.Most recently, Brazil’s largest independent brokerage announced its plans to integrate a Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange in the next few months, after receiving support from the government which opened an investigation into the country’s major banks amid allegations that banks have not been providing crypto exchanges with sufficient banking services.“The reason this thing [cryptocurrency] really had legs was after 2011, when there was a bubble and it went up, and it came down, and it didn’t go to zero. It kind of stabilized and kept coming back up. Around that time was basically when I said ‘Okay, this is going to stick around, it’s got legs, it’s not going to zero.’ That was kind of a build year. We have this kind of bubble-crash-build phases in crypto, and that is really when I start to get involved.”The bubble-crash phase of Bitcoin and the crypto market was January to July, and as the market has done since 2011, the cryptocurrency market is expected to recover. In comparison to last year, in terms of regulation, infrastructure and developer activity, the cryptocurrency and blockchain sector has improved by unprecedented levels.Ben Horowitz, the co-founder of Andreessen Horowitz (A16Z), a venture capital firm considered to be one of the most successful technology-focused investment companies, stated that the developer activity in the blockchain sector resonates similar to that of the internet in the 1990s.Horowitz explained that he has not seen such a high level of developer activity in a single industry since the internet, and considering that cryptocurrencies and blockchain networks are essentially computing networks, the exponential increase in the developer activity of blockchain projects is a positive indicator of growth.“I think that there is probably more developer activity in crypto than in anything we’ve seen since the internet and the right way to think about it is [that] it’s a new computing platform. Once every decade or two, a new computing platform comes along. The thing that is deceptive about [it] is that when the new platform at the time is generally worse in most ways than the old platform but has some new capabilities.”Ben Horowitz, the co-founder of Andreessen HorowitzIn a study released in 2017, JP Vergne, a professor at Ivey Business School, revealed that developer activity is the most accurate indicator of cryptocurrency exchange rate trends.Based on the trend of the market since 2011 and its ability to recover to new all-time highs after a major correction, it is highly likely — given the high developer activity around large blockchain networks — that the cryptocurrency market will recovery by the end of this year as many experts predict."

Despite that, the chairman has suggested that the Bitcoin mining “wave” has contributed to the faster growth of local energy and data industries, whose well-developed infrastructures are now expected to provide a boost to blockchain-related businesses.Iceland has become one of the leaders in crypto mining due to its naturally cold climate, as well as the abundance of cost-efficient renewable energy sources – mainly geothermal and hydroelectric. The country is home to one of the world’s 5 largest crypto mining farms, whose operator Genesis Mining is reportedly the single largest consumer of electricity in Iceland.In February, Johann Snorri Sigurbergsson, the business development manager of a local energy supplier HS Orka, predicted that the volume of crypto mining in Iceland will likely double in 2018.HS Orka’s CEO Asgeir Margeirsson claimed in July that the industry of crypto mining has pushed “the fourth revolution,” while the director of the Icelandic Institute for Intelligent Machines stated that Bitcoin miners are “central to the industrial revolution that is still under way.”However, HS Orka’s Sigurbergsson also argued that Bitcoin “probably won’t be here far into the future,” claiming that the data centers that are currently used by miners will eventually become new technology incubators.Earlier this week, blockchain technology group Bitfury announced the launch of its new-generation BTC mining hardware, with plans to use the new machines in its mining centers in Canada, Norway, Iceland and Georgia."

Consequently, the regulator’s decision was postponed yet again.","Here’s why the VanEck/SolidX ETF has a greater chance than the nine ETF temporarily rejected by the SEC in August, and why a BTC ETF isn’t likely to appear until 2019.Cointelegraph has previously covered ETFs and why they are important for mass adoption. In short, an ETF is a kind of investment fund that is tied to the price of an underlying asset — a commodity, an index, bonds or a basket of assets — like an index fund and is traded on exchanges, available to both retail and institutional investors.A Bitcoin ETF, in turn, tracks Bitcoin as the underlying asset. It is an indirect way of purchasing BTC, where the investor only holds the corresponding security without having to store the actual coins. If listed on a regulated U.S. exchange, it could pave the way for large mainstream investors, potentially pushing Bitcoin toward broader recognition on Wall Street.That’s what this Bitcoin ETF powered by investment firm VanEck and financial service company SolidX is trying to achieve. Both VanEck and SolidX had tried registering their ETF separately beforehand — in August 2017 and in July 2016 respectively — but the SEC denied both attempts.Now, their collaborative ETF is generally viewed as one of the most promising ones. The fund is tied to VanEck's subsidiary index MVIS, which will calculate the real-time price of BTC based on executable bids and asks derived from U.S.-based crypto over-the-counter (OTC) markets instead of more conventional crypto exchanges, while SolidX will sponsor the project. It is expected to be listed on the Chicago Board of Exchange (CBOE) BZX Equities Exchange. The fund’s bid with the SEC was filed on June 6.Unlike the Winklevoss’ ETF attempt (and nine other ETFs that the SEC rejected earlier in August), the VanEck/SolidX fund puts additional emphasis on insurance: It is derivative-backed, as per its press release, implying that the firms will actually hold BTC. This will allegedly protect against the loss or theft of the cryptocurrency.Moreover, each share of the VanEck SolidX Bitcoin Trust is set to cost a substantial $200,000. As SolidX CEO Daniel H. Gallancy has previously explained to CNBC, the price is set at a higher rate to attract more institutional, rather than retail investors.Nevertheless, the SEC have been taking its time to issue a decision on the aforementioned ETF. First, on Aug. 7, the agency postponed the case until Sept. 30. In the notice, the SEC stated that it had received more than 1,300 comments on the proposed rule change to list and trade shares of the VanEck SolidX ETF. It didn’t specify why exactly the delay was taking place.Then, on Sept. 20, the SEC requested further comments regarding its decision on the VanEck SolidX ETF. The watchdog explained that it has not “reached any conclusions with respect to any of the issues involved,” and is asking for additional comments from interested parties, addressing the adequacy of the BZX exchange’s statement in support of the proposal.In particular, the SEC is seeking comments on 18 key issues, among them are commenters’ views on BZX’s assertions that BTC “is arguably less susceptible to manipulation than other commodities that underlie exchange-traded products (ETPs),” as well as SolidX’s assertion that “the OTC desks have a better measure of the market than anyexchange-specific reference price,” among others. The note further reads:“The Commission is instituting proceedings to allow for additional analysis of the proposed rule change’s consistency with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act, which requires, among other things, that the rules of a national securities exchange be ‘designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade,’ and ‘to protect investors and the public interest.’”The SEC now has until February 2019 to come up with a decision (the allowable delays are served in two increments: one six-month delay and one final three-month delay, which makes nine months in total). Given the fact that the SEC has requested another round of comments after receiving more than 1,300 letters in previous months, it suggests that the agency is still uncertain about the state of the crypto market.Thus, the SEC’s relationship with crypto-related ETFs has been rocky so far. For instance, when it rejected nine applications to list and trade various BTC ETFs in August, the regulator made a U-turn as soon as on the following day and stated that it would review its decision of all those ETFs in the future — the agency has still not released a deadline for that, however.Similarly, on July 26, the SEC’s rejection of the Winklevoss brothers’ application for a Bitcoin ETF also came with a silver lining. Soon after the hearing, SEC Commissioner Hester M. Peirce released a statement, where she opined that the agency’s move “sends a strong signal that innovation is unwelcome in our markets, a signal that may have effects far beyond the fate of Bitcoin ETPs.” Moreover, she claimed that the agency overstepped “its limited role” because it focused on the nature of the underlying BTC market instead of the derivative itself.Still, the SEC has explained all its rejections (not delays) for ETFs in a similar fashion. The main problem seems to be that the applicants are not meeting the requirements to “prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices” on the market.Additionally, the watchdog had pointed out the inadequate size of the Bitcoin ETF market. In August, the regulatory body wrote:“Among other things, the Exchange has offered no record evidence to demonstrate that Bitcoin futures markets are ‘markets of significant size.’ That failure is critical because [...] the Exchange has failed to establish that other means to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices will be sufficient, and therefore surveillance-sharing with a regulated market of significant size related to Bitcoin is necessary.”The SEC has also stressed that its decisions did not rest “on an evaluation of whether Bitcoin, or blockchain technology more generally, has utility or value as an innovation or an investment.""It is unclear what might change the SEC’s negative sentiment — one could argue that top investment players’ funds could make the market more liquid and large scale, but there is a paradox: It is more likely to happen once a crypto-related ETF receives the watchdog’s blessing and enters the market in full force.There is a possibility that some of the comments the agency will receive over the following months might play a role too — but it is a considerably weaker one, giving the fact that the SEC had already dealt with more than 1,300 comments on the VanEck SolidX case alone.Still, the crypto industry might become more war-ready by 2019. In an interview with CNBC aired in August, crypto analyst Brian Kelly predicted that the SEC would postpone their decision on VanEck SolidX’ ETF and also argued that, according to statistics from CME derivatives marketplace, the futures market is evolving quickly and that we will likely “have a much better shot” at ETF approval by next year:“Here’s CME Futures open interest of large holders. [As of] April, you’re starting to see a big increase […] about an 85 percent growth rate. If you extrapolate that out, by February 2019, you’re going to have a very robust market here.”Meanwhile, even more solid players might try their hand in the ETF race. On Sept 7, the world’s largest asset investment manager, BlackRock, which oversees $6.3 trillion in assets, and Coinbase, a major crypto platform, announced they were in talks to develop a cryptocurrency-based ETF to boost market activity and facilitate growing demand from Wall Street and other institutions."

In February, Russian security agents scored a coup against a ...","Sep 30, 2018",Gone are the days when shady dealings in crypto were perceived as immune to the clutches of law enforcement.,"Illicit crypto proceeds can be shuttled between wallet addresses at the click of a mouse, and their obfuscation behind the multiple strings of numbers and letters of wallet addresses can create a dizzying — if not impenetrable — cryptographic maze for authorities to navigate.But the criminals themselves present a more concrete target, and as they interface with everything from crafty code to unwieldy hardware to ‘traditional’ firearms, there has been some success in 2018 in nabbing some of the year’s darkest — and most imaginative — offenders.From soap actors to former lawmakers, Cointelegraph takes stock of some of the most illustrious arrests of the figures behind crypto’s high crimes and misdemeanours this year.In February, Russian security agents scored a coup against a group of nuclear engineers at a top-secret nuclear warhead facility who tried to use one of the country’s most powerful supercomputers to mine Bitcoin (BTC).The engineers worked at the Federal Nuclear Center in the western city of Sarov — formerly one of the Soviet Union’s closed-off cities, unmarked on historic maps and shrouded in secrecy.As one of the Soviet “closed administrative territorial entities,” Sarov was then known as Arzamas-16, and was the center of research and production for the first Soviet atomic bomb and hydrogen bomb under Joseph Stalin. Special permits are still required today for ordinary Russians to visit it.With such a stellar off-grid history, you’d think the Bitcoin-hungry nuclear engineers might have suspected that connecting the site’s supercomputer — a 1 petaflop titan with a capacity for 1,000 trillion calculations per second — to the internet might draw just a little attention.As soon as the engineers tried to bring it online, the security department was alerted and was able to foil the scientists, who were peremptorily handed over to the Federal Security Service (FSB).Tatiana Zalesskaya, the head of the press service for the research institute, told the Interfax news agency that that the attempt was a “technically hopeless and criminally punishable offense.""A criminal case was reportedly duly opened against them.Contentiously, it has been alleged that the radioactive polonium-210 used to kill ex-FSB agent Alexander Litvinenko in London in 2006 was produced in Sarov, which houses a plant that is said to be the “world’s only commercial producer of the substance,” according to evidence presented before a court in the United Kingdom.Sarov’s rogue scientists are not the only ones to have thought of using former Soviet military spaces for crypto mining. The Ice Rock Mining firm has plans to — legally — set up mining operations in a former Soviet bunker located in a cave in Almaty, Kazakhstan.This summer, reports emerged tied to the story of a Finnish millionaire allegedly fooled by a Thai crypto investment scam — to the tune of Bitcoin worth 797 million baht ($24.62 million) at the time.According to the Thai Crime Suppression Division (CSD), the 22-year-old Finn, identified as Aarni Otava Saarimaa, claimed he had been lured into investing his Bitcoin into several companies, a casino and the gambling-focused crypto token Dragon Coin.Saarima’s business partner, the Thai businessman Chonnikan Kaeosali, reportedly first approached the CSD in January this year, outlining how the pair had been drawn to purchase shares in three firms — Expay Group, NX Chain Inc. and DNA 2002 Plc — that were purported to be investors in Dragon Coin. He said they had first been approached in connection with the affair by a local Thai group back in June 2017.The fraudsters are said to have taken their would-be victims around a Macau-based casino where they claimed the gambling-focused token would soon be used. Saarima subsequently transferred his crypto but never saw returns, shareholder papers nor any proof of investment in Dragon Coin.As the CSD’s investigations unfolded, they identified a group of nine suspects — three of whom were revealed to be a group of siblings from the Jaravijit family. The suspects are said to have swiftly sold the crypto for local fiat currency, dispersing the spoils between various bank accounts.It was the arrest of one of the siblings this summer — a dapper 27-year-old soap-opera star known as Jiratpisit ""Boom"" Jaravijit — that first brought the case to public light.  On Aug. 9, Boom was taken into custody on money laundering charges in the midst of filming at the Major Cineplex Ratchayothin in Bangkok’s Chatuchak district. Local media noted it was the day after the star’s birthday.It was alleged that the actor had colluded with his siblings to launder the swindled money, after investigations revealed they had bought 14 plots of land worth 176 million baht ($5.44 million).Boom’s brother, Prinya Jaravijit, is said to have been the ringleader of the scheme, having reportedly received a tip-off from a Thai banker about the wealthy Finn and then setting the heist in motion. Prinya has reportedly fled to South Korea, while Boom’s sister is said to have made contact with the CSD to turn herself in.The CSD has sought arrest warrants for a further six suspects and frozen a total of 51 different bank accounts in addition to the siblings’ land.Boom was temporarily released on a 2 million baht ($61,827) bail bond on the condition that he would not leave the country, having argued that his arrest on set in a public place was ample proof he had not been intending to flee.Earlier this month, another Jaravijit sibling turned himself in to deny the fraud charges, while police met two further suspects: Prasit Srisuwan, a well-known stock trader, and Chakris Ahmad.Boom’s parents, Mr. Suwit and Ms. Lertchatkamol, have also been questioned after police traced that 90 million baht ($2.78 million) had been transferred to their accounts. Both have denied involvement.As news of the many-tentacled Bitconnect investment heist continues to unfold globally, recent developments have unearthed a web of kidnappings and extortions allegedly tied to Bitconnect investors in the wealthy state of Gujarat.  Earlier this month, a former Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) for India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was remanded in custody for allegedly conspiring with local police to kidnap and extort Bitcoin from a Gujarati Bitconnect investor.In February, a Surat-based builder by the name of Shailesh Bhatt had charged into the Home Minister's office in the Indian state of Gujarat, alleging that 10 district cops had kidnapped and extorted him for 176 BTC, worth 9.45 crore* rupee (around $1.31 million).*A crore rupee denotes 10 million and is equal to 100 lakh rupee in the Indian numbering system (1 lakh rupee denotes 100,000)The band of 10 was alleged to have comprised not only rank-and-file constables but even a superintendent and a local Crime Branch Inspector.Bhatt, who is said to have been known for his penchant for Bitcoin trading, claimed he had been duped by one of his business aides, Kirit Paladiya, into thinking that the authorities were keeping him under close watch for his crypto dealings.He alleged he had been lured by a phone call from his local Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), where he was allegedly beaten in a “torture room” and asked by a CBI official to pay a cash ransom.Two days later, he claimed he was kidnapped during a meeting with his aide Paladiya near a fuel station, where he was whisked off to a local farm house. There, he said, ""[the police officers] beat me up inside a room and threatened to kill me [...] if I did not hand over my Bitcoins.""Bhatt then accused Paladiya of double-crossing him in cahoots with his influential uncle, the former BJP MLA Nalin Kotadiya, who he claimed had been the one who pressured him into paying the ransom.Bhatt has himself been subsequently accused of being a wolf in sheep’s clothing. He has become embroiled in a case pertaining to an alleged earlier extortion of a staggering 1.55 billion rupee ($215 million) worth of crypto and cash at gunpoint — including around 2,400 BTC — from two colleagues of well-known local Bitconnect promoter Satish Kumbhani.  However, Indian authorities nonetheless believed there is some weight behind the accusations against the former lawmaker Kotadiya, first issuing an arrest warrant against him in mid-May.Kotadiya has repeatedly hit back against the allegations, notably via a WhatsApp video — reposted on Youtube in late April — in which, attired in pink, he claimed he had duly informed authorities about the Bitcoin heist and attributed the full blame for the extortion scandal and conspiracy to Bhatt.Moreover, he threatened to leak evidence that would implicate even more local politicians in the scandal, saying that Bhatt was protecting them and therefore attempting to “fix him” in the case.Nonetheless, by mid-June, a local sessions judge declared Kotadiya a ""proclaimed offender"" (absconder) and demanded he appear before the court within 30 days.As Kotadiya continued to elude the clutches of law enforcement throughout summer, he was finally nabbed after four months in hiding on Sept. 10. He was reportedly found “fast asleep” on the second floor of a railway quarters still under construction, after a local contractor gave police the golden tip-off.“When we [eventually] found him, he was sleeping on a mattress and there was just an earthen pot of water in the room.”As Cointelegraph has reported, Kotadiya’s alleged embroilment has been a political gold mine for the opposition party, the Indian National Congress (INC), who allege that further members of the ruling BJP have used the Bitconnect scam to launder undeclared “black” money.“The finger of suspicion of this massive scam of illegal cryptocurrency directly points to several top Bharatiya Janata Party leaders and a mastermind — an absconding BJP leader and former MLA Nalin Kotadiya […] Who are the top BJP leaders against whom Kotadiya has damning evidence? We demand an impartial Supreme Court-monitored judicial investigation.”As of press time, the time of Kotadiya’s custody is up, yet the alleged evidence he claims to wield is yet to have been made public.This year, what has been described as one of Iceland’s “largest criminal cases in history” has seen an outlandish set of twists and turns, leading all the way to the northern Chinese city of Tianjin.In February, news broke of a series of unprecedented thefts, involving powerful computing equipment that had been stolen in a “highly organized” Bitcoin mining heist. Three burglaries were reported to have taken place in December 2017 and a fourth in January.The burglars had allegedly swiped 20 million krónur (around $180,000) worth of equipment — 600 graphics cards, 100 power supplies, 100 motherboards, 100 memory discs and 100 CPU processors — from a house in the municipality of Reykjanesbær.They had also allegedly broken into data centers across both Reykjanesbær and Borgarbyggð, with a total of 600 computers stolen from both places, worth 200 million krónur (almost $2 million). The whereabouts of the equipment, including the computers — said to have been used for Bitcoin mining — remained untraceable, even as authorities monitored energy consumption for suspicious increases.Police are said to have initially arrested eleven suspects — two of which were ordered to remain in custody, after the Icelandic IT firm Advania produced incriminating surveillance footage taken at the data center in Reykjanesbær. The authorities soon recovered most of the stolen equipment, yet the 600 computers remained elusive. Both suspects were reported in local media as being “uncooperative.”Then, on April 17, one of the detainees escaped at 1 a.m. from his custody in an “open” (low-security) prison, just a week before authorities were due to move forward with an indictment.The fugitive, Sindri Thor Stefánsson, fled the country on a passport bearing another man’s name, boarding a passenger plane to Sweden that was embarrassingly revealed to have been carrying Iceland’s prime minister.Stefánsson subsequently released a statement claiming he had been “legally allowed” to travel on the day he boarded the plane to Stockholm, as his custody ruling expired April 16 and a judge had requested 24 hours to consider its renewal. This, according, to him, left a brief interim during which the warrant for his custody was legally invalid.He vowed to return home “soon,” telling reporters he would be challenging his two-and-a-half-month custody at the European Court of Human Rights.Days later, he was arrested in central Amsterdam, after a photo published on Instagram with the hashtag #teamsindri allegedly gave him away, according to media outlet Iceland Monitor. Police at the time did not confirm this was the case.Allegedly incriminating Instagram snap of Stefánsson in Amsterdam: Source: Iceland MonitorDespite #teamsindri reportedly briefly trending across Icelandic Twitter, the case last month came to a head when a judge charged Stefánsson — alongside six others — with the theft of the 600 computers. While Stefánsson’s charge has been confirmed as theft, it remains unclear what role the other six defendants are charged with as having in the incident.Just days after Stefansson’s Amsterdam stint, police in the northern Chinese city of Tianjin seized 600 computers used to mine Bitcoin, after abnormal electricity usage attracted the attention of the local power grid operator. Local media outlets reported the case as being the ""largest power theft case in recent years,” but it notably also drew the attention of authorities back in Iceland, who suspected the exact number match of suspect hardware was more than just an uncanny coincidence.Icelandic police subsequently reached out to Chinese authorities to try to link the two cases, yet no results have been reported since then.Last month, Californian police nabbed a hacker who allegedly stole Bitcoin worth over $1 million via a series of so-called ‘SIM-swapping’ heists — also known as ‘port-out scams.’ The 19-year-old suspect, identified as Xzavyer Narvaez, is said to have specialized in stealing cell phone numbers and using them to hijack online financial and social media accounts tied to those numbers.A SIM-swap attack results in the victim suddenly losing all service, with any incoming calls or text messages redirected to the attacker’s device. As many firms use automated messages or phone calls to handle customer authentication, SIM swaps can be a goldmine in deft hands.  Prosecutors allege that Narvaez used his ill-gotten crypto proceeds to purchase luxury goods, including a $200,000 high-performance McLaren sport car, which were tracked through records obtained from Bitcoin payment provider BitPay.According to cybercrime blog Krebs on Security, the investigators interviewed several alleged victims of Narvaez, one of whom claimed he was robbed of $150,000 in crypto after his SIM was hijacked.Between March and June 2018 alone, Narvaez’s account on crypto exchange Bittrex reportedly saw a flow of a staggering 157 BTC. He subsequently faced charges on four counts of using personal identifying information without authorization; four counts of altering and damaging computer data with intent to defraud or obtain money, or other value; and grand theft of personal property of a value over $950,000, according to court documents.VICE’s parallel investigations traced Narvaez’s impressive “credentials” in the SIM-swapping underworld, with one source telling the magazine that he was considered “one of the best […] out there.” VICE’s source provided screenshots of Narvaez’s former Instagram account, which allegedly featured euphoric photos of his fresh, 2018 snow white McLaren, accompanied by the caption “live fast, die young.”Narvaez is said to have come under the radar of law enforcement following the arrest of one Joel Ortiz, described as “a gifted 20-year-old college student from Boston” who was charged this July with using SIM swaps to swipe over $5 million in crypto from 40 different victims.A redacted “statement of facts” in the case obtained by Krebs revealed that records obtained from Google had traced that a cellular device used by Ortiz to commit SIM swaps had at one point been used to access the Google account identified as Xzavyer.Narvaez@gmail.com.In an unrelated case this July, Florida police reportedly arrested a 25-year-old, Ricky Joseph Handschumacher, who was accused of being part of a multi-state, cyber-fraud SIM-swapping ring that operated over the course of two years.The gang of nine — scattered across different states — was initially tracked in February, when a “worried mom” overheard her son talking on the phone impersonating a telecoms firm employee. The group is alleged to have “routinely paid” employees at cell phone companies to assist in their schemes and to even have discussed a plan to hack accounts belonging to the CEO of the high-profile Gemini Trust company — namely those of Bitcoin billionaire Tyler Winklevoss.Handschumacher himself posted multiple flashy purchases — including a pickup truck, multiple all-terrain vehicles and jet skis — on his public Facebook profile. Subpoenas to Coinbase revealed he had sold 82 BTC through his account, “virtually all” of which were not purchased on the platform.As law enforcement closed in on this host of spry and unabashed millennial SIM swappers, in August, a U.S. investor filed a $224 million lawsuit, taking on telecoms giant AT&T. Michael Terpin accused the firm of alleged negligence, claiming that $24 million in crypto was stolen via a ""digital identity theft"" of his cell phone account.His complaint alleged that:""What AT&T did was like a hotel giving a thief with a fake ID a room key and a key to the room safe to steal jewelry in the safe from the rightful owner.""The most recent high-profile, crypto-related “detention” involves OKEx CEO Star Xu, who was the subject of a host of conflicting media reports — and even one viral dumpling-related anecdote — following his sudden tête-à-tête with Chinese authorities this month.Xu has robustly hit back at rumors that fraud was the reason for his purported ‘arrest,’ after local media reported that he had faced problems at his hotel from a group of investors in WFEE Coin, a blockchain WiFi sharing project they claimed Xu held shares in.The allegedly defrauded victims had reportedly contacted Shanghai police, who “summoned” the CEO to a police station on Sept. 10 to ""put [him] through a round of questioning to get to the bottom of the rumors,"" as tech news source ZeroHedge wrote at the time.A photograph of a police report about Xu on local news outlet Sina Technology appeared to confirm that the police had been notified at 5:59 p.m. on Sept. 10.Image of police report allegedly involving Star Xu’s detention. Source: Sina TechnologyAt the same time, alternative sources in China claimed the investors were in fact traders incensed by system failures on the OKEx exchange itself. As Bitcoin (BTC) tumbled on Sept. 5, OKEx platform crashes are alleged to have left users unable to close or otherwise salvage their positions, with losses all the more acute in the case of leveraged trades.Cointelegraph’s own Chinese sources have since thrown some degree of light on what had spiralled into a sordid media affair, substantiating suspicions that much of the hearsay was indeed “fake news.”The sources have emphasized that Xu was the one who approached the police of his own accord. In their account, on Sept. 10, Xu had arrived at the Shanghai office of OK Group to meet with customers and conduct other business affairs. He had also — incidentally — made an appointment at the office to meet with a prospective personal fitness coach.There, the first troubles with the disgruntled investors are said to have begun — who are thought to have been a mix of OKCoin and WFEE Coin investors. Some ambiguity remains as to their exact identity — and whether they were indeed railing against problems tied to the OKEx exchange or held Xu responsible for the vicissitudes of the WFEE token, or a mix of both.Having gotten wind of Xu’s visit to Shanghai, the aggrieved group is alleged to have been responsible for vandalizing the sign at the city’s OK Group office, as appears to be shown in the following photograph:Photo showing the apparent vandalization of OK Group’s entrance sign at the Shanghai officeAn alarmed Xu is said to have headed back to his hotel, telling his prospective coach to make her way there as well, so as to resume their meeting. The investors are alleged to have then followed the woman’s tracks, suspecting she would lead them to Xu. There, they are alleged to have knocked on the door of the CEO’s room, threatening him.After four tense hours, Xu is said to have alerted the police. The investors are again alleged to have followed his trail, whereupon Xu called a group of “henchmen” to join him at the police station. At this point, the investors are said to have taken fright and approached the authorities themselves.In an interview published soon after his release, Xu confirmed he had been held by Shanghai police, seeming to imply he had made the contact on his own initiative:“In Shanghai, someone reported that I was defrauding. I went to the police station to explain the situation and proved to the police that I did not swindle.”On Twitter, OKEx COO Cheung also stated that Xu had been encircled by a group in Shanghai, although in his account, the police are said to have arrived to the scene themselves and moved all parties involved to the station. Cheung alleged that:“While Star was invited to help with the investigation and those people was detained, they raised a fraud complaint against Star. Star stayed to clarify and then left afterward.”According to Cointelegraph’s sources, no one was witness to Xu’s departure from the station, and it remains unclear how long he spent there.Xu has stated that while it is “normal” for citizens to exercise their right to make such allegations, he has equally fulfilled his “duty” as a citizen by cooperating with the authorities. In terms of his alleged responsibility for system “abnormalities” on the exchange, Xu has responded that:“I am not a legal person of OKEx, nor am I a shareholder or a director.”This point was echoed in Cheung’s parallel tweets, in which the COO stressed that “Star is the founder of OK Group, [and] although we are good friends, he does not run OKEx.” Cheung has added that he felt “disappointed that the story was twisted before the truth came out.”Local news outlet Jiemian has meanwhile reported that seven out of a total of 300 investors who claimed to have “suffered heavy losses” on the OKEx exchange have since reached a form of settlement with Xu. Notably, repeated system failures are alleged to have caused a total economic loss of “around 300 million yuan.”In his post-release interview, Xu stressed that while leveraged trading is a “neutral tool in itself,” it is “not suitable for ordinary investors” as the potential for accelerated net profits and losses requires “professional knowledge” to manage the risks involved.As Jiemian noted, while OKEx offers investors the opportunity to add as much as 20 times leverage to their contracts, unlike traditional futures trading platforms, the exchange operates without regulatory oversight.As for the WFEE connection, OK Blockchain Capital (OKBC) — a strategic partner of OKEx and a subsidiary of OK Group — has publicly refuted the allegations that Xu had any shares in the project, tweeting on Sept. 12 that:“The rumor that OK Group founder Star Xu [is] a shareholder of WFEE is fake. Mr. Xu has no equity relationship with WFEE and its company.”OKBC has further clarified its own relationship with WFEE, stating that “OKBC is one of the institutional investors of WFEE.” WFEE reportedly “acquired OKBC's and several other capitals’ investments [...] when it was still the prime partner of WeShare WiFi — a global leading WiFi sharing company.” The firm added that it had not been notified of subsequent changes to the WFEE white paper, as OKBC “neither participates in” WFEE’s operations, nor in its “results.”OKBC has also pointed to the fact that OKEx had warned its users of the potential risks posed by WFEE in August and included WFEE in their first “Token Delisting/Hiding Guideline [sic].”So... what of the dumplings?Amid the flurry of “twisted” media reports, one viral anecdote alleged that the band of investors had brought a hungry — and short-of-cash — Xu some sustenance, namely dumplings, as he underwent questioning at the police station. The story, despite its oddity, appears to have had some traction. Cointelegraph’s Chinese sources, for their part, dismissed it out-of-hand as an unthinkable and breathless piece of confected hearsay."

Trust.","Oct 4, 2018","Comedians from the United States are quite used to making fun of Canada, depicting their neighbors as some sort of peaceful simpletons, with the series South Park as probably the prime example. However, even if you ignore that Wolverine — the toughest of all the X-Men — is Canadian, you should revise this worn-out cliché, considering how this realm of the Commonwealth seems to march to a faster pace than the United States in the race for cryptocurrency adoption.                    ","While the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) recent requests seem to delay the possibility of encompassing regulation with regard to introducing a Bitcoin-based exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the U.S., their Canadian ‘cousins’ took this landmark decision almost a year ago. In fact, the British Columbia Securities Commission granted the possibility of the registration of Bitcoin investment fund managers on Sept. 6, 2017, and the first company to take this opportunity, First Block Capital, has since then achieved recognition for its fund, FBC Bitcoin Trust. Recently, it became eligible to enter registered accounts such as the Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) and a Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA).Other financial vehicles have contributed to making the Canadian fintech scene a lively one. For instance, there is the Blockchain Technologies ETF (HBLK), a fund based on the Harvest Blockchain Index — a portfolio which tracks the performance of some of the leading public companies with business activities focused on blockchain activities in North America. More recently, other funds pegged to the performance of indexes based on stock issued by blockchain companies — such as Coincapital STOXX, Blockchain Patents Innovation Index Fund (LDGR) and the Coincapital STOXX B.R.AI.N. Index Fund (THNK) — appeared on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Both of the latter funds are promoted by Coin Investment Management, a recently created Coinsquare subsidiary (the exchange defines itself as “Canada’s home for digital currencies”). Also, the pioneer First Block Capital, is working on new vehicles, announced under the names of FBC Active Blockchain Opportunities ETF and FBC Cryptocurrency Index Fund.If an ETF could be considered the holy grail in terms of legitimizing digital assets within the regulated financial system — and therefore news about them is often more eye-catching — then Canada has demonstrated that it has many other crypto-arrows in its quiver.Blockchain and cryptocurrencies have been part of the Canadian landscape for many years. Maybe you have forgotten the nationality of the comic heroes as Wolverine, but you should remember that, even though Vitalik Buterin was born near Moscow, he has lived in Toronto from the age of six. Since 2017, Toronto, the capital of Ontario, has also been the headquarters of the Blockchain Research Institute, but even some very well-established Canadian institutions — such as the Bank of Canada or the Competition Bureau Canada — have demonstrated a strong degree of interest and acceptance for the potential of the blockchain and of digital currencies.The Canadian tax system too, even if not very forgiving, has been fully aware of cryptocurrencies since 2013, when the Canada Revenue Agency established its basic rules on the topic: If digital assets are held and traded as a capital asset, the possible profit is taxed as a capital gain (applied to 50 percent of the amount). If cryptocurrencies are used as a means of payment, the transaction is interpreted as a form of barter (because the two parties agree to exchange goods or services without using a legal tender), the value of which is converted in Canadian dollars and included in the seller’s income for tax purposes (depending on the Canadian province, business income taxation varies from 26.5 percent to 30 percent, and that of individuals from 44.5 percent to 58.75 percent). According to its value, mining is taxed as either a business profit or as a personal hobby, which makes it non-taxable.Alongside human institutions, nature itself seems to support Canada’s march toward a blockchain economy. The country is extraordinarily well-endowed in term of hydro-power generation capability, and Canada — especially regions such as Quebec — enjoys the lowest electricity rates in North America. Cheap electricity drove Bitmain to Quebec and is what literally fuels the competition between the Chinese mining giant and its local rival Hut 8.Therefore, it’s not surprising that research published by the Bank of Canada in July 2018 indicated that Canadian citizens’ level of awareness in regard to cryptocurrencies rose from 77 percent in 2016 to 93 percent in 2017 (at least in British Columbia, the most ‘crypto-wise’ province, according to the report). However, the same survey underlined that Bitcoin (and other crypto assets, by extension) is seen by the vast majority of the respondents as an investment, more than as a means to buy goods and services (by the way, in 2016, the majority of Canadian Bitcoin holders purchased them because they were ‘interested in new technologies’).The path toward a real and sustainable mass adoption should pass  through the creation of reliable services and new businesses, using blockchain and crypto assets to run them.The Canadian approach to ICOs is indicated by elements such as a lightly regulated general framework, incentives for startups and innovation, and decentralization and coordination on the part of different authorities working at the federal and provincial levels.The last point is probably the key element in terms of shaping the features of the Canadian perspective toward regulation: Canada is a federation of 10 provinces and three territories, and the Canadian Securities Administration (CSA) defines itself merely as “an umbrella organization of Canada’s provincial and territorial securities regulators whose objective is to improve, coordinate and harmonize regulation.” This brings a plurality of slightly different regulatory frameworks. In addition, it supports an interventionist approach, which aims to keep the regulator closer to the local market and to the investor community, relying on efficient and light structures.CSA put its machine in motion in February 2017, when its chair and president, Louis Morisset, announced the creation of a regulatory sandbox — an initiative aiming to provide a time-limited registration for businesses able to demonstrate themselves truly innovative and committed to ensuring appropriate investor protection, notwithstanding some other formal requirements. The eligible business models encompass cryptocurrency-related activities, crowdfunding portals, online lenders, angel investor networks, applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in trading and technological services provided to regulatory activity (RegTech).All the applications are considered on a case-by-case basis, in a procedure managed — at least in its early stages — by the local securities regulators in order to achieve a faster and more flexible process than through a standard application process.The resources mobilized by the different local authorities could vary, following differences on the part of different provinces. Certainly, It is easy to recognize the prominence of the regulators in charge for the most populous and most economically active areas, such as the British Columbia Security Commission, Quebec’s Autorité des Marchés Financiers and the Ontario Security Commission. Visiting the website of this final commission, which is devoted to the initiative the OSC LaunchPad, you find a friendly and smart interface, looking more as a startup incubator design than that of a regulatory agency.The CSA Regulatory Sandbox has now authorized eight applicants, among which there are a venture capital platform focused on startups, five cryptocurrency investment funds and two ICOs.The attitude of the Canadian authorities is to affirm the need to apply the fundamentals of security law (prospectus and registration) to new fintech businesses, recognizing the possibility, however, that such a new industry may require some exceptions, at least on a temporary basis.The first Staff Notice on Cryptocurrency Offering issued by the CSA in August 2017 (SN 46-307), for instance, stated that “every ICO/ITO is unique and must be assessed on its own characteristics,” then indicating the guidelines to ensure respect for the substantial goals of the regulation process (business development and investors’ protection), even in case of exemptions from some of its formal requirements. After many months of experimentation with the sandbox, the CSA has been able to publish more precise guidelines — for instance, defining the concrete elements which classify a token as a security or a non-security (in the SN 46-308, June 11, 2018).The placid and pragmatic CSA philosophy was also summarized in the video “BC Security Commission” posted on YouTube at the end of 2017 while the crypto world was enjoying an apparently unstoppable rise of the market. As of press time, the video has a surprisingly low number of views: little more than 5,800, with only 9 likes. The following shift from FOMO to FUD and some witch-hunt style statements against ICOs and cryptos, showed that, maybe, Canada has some lessons to teach us all.Instead of having square heads and curious habits as depicted in South Park, Canadians seem to be cruising smoothly toward a consistent adoption of digital finance and blockchain in their economic and institutional environment. At the same time, in the U.S., ETF proponents are still struggling with the SEC, and all the ICO movement is engulfed by a law from the 1930s preventing residents of the country with the largest number of ICO-financed projects to legally participate in any ICO. The Security Act of 1933 – the document that currently shapes the main decisions about cryptocurrencies in the US – was born as a consequence of the 1929 Wall Street Crash and often seems to bring back memories of another era, which happens to be another period in which the two North American countries experienced a regulatory divide on a rather controversial topic.Canada adopted Prohibition in 1916, even before its southern neighbor (in the U.S., liquor was sold until 1920). However, the Canadian temperance laws varied in a rather sensitive way, allowing the production, selling and consumption of alcohol under specific conditions, or referring only to particular kinds of drinks. Generally, all these experiments were demonstrated to be ineffective in a very short time, and by the mid-1920s, the majority of the provinces had begun to repeal Prohibition or to modify it in regulation aimed at moderating instead of forbidding alcohol consumption. Meanwhile in the U.S., Prohibition, which was not only ineffective but sometimes harmful, endured until 1933 — when almost all Canadians had their booze back by 1927-1930. Quebec was the first province to repeal its — very moderate — prohibition law in 1919 and Montreal became a sort of promised land for the thirsty U.S. bon vivants: Special trains crossing the borders were organized and Irving Berlin’s song Hello Montreal! was one of the hits of 1928 (“Goodbye Broadway, hello Montreal / I’m on my way, I’m on my way / And I’ll make whoop-whoop whoopee night and day!”).Who knows if, in the future, there won’t be cohorts of U.S. investors and fintech entrepreneurs flocking across the border to find a freer place in which they can quench their thirst?Source: Newberry Library, Chicago IL"

There isn’t an opportunity for yet another 1,000-times growth in anything in the space anymore.”According to Buterin, the initial strategy seen over the past six or seven years in the crypto community – based on marketing coins with the goal of widespread adoption – has resulted in massive growth price and market capitalization of many cryptocurrencies, but that it is now “getting close to hitting a dead end.”Crypto markets have seen a dramatic decline in terms of total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies during 2018. In January, total market cap of all cryptocurrencies hit $828 billion point. The peak in total market cap has been followed by a gradual downturn – with a rebound upwards in May – that has led to the current figure of $198.8 billion, the lowest point since  early November 2017, according to CoinMarketCap.1-year total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies chart. Source: CoinMarketCapHowever, while crypto markets have seen a significant decline in 2018, the current figures are still much more than those in the beginning of 2017, when total market capitalization stood at around $17-20 billion, and major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum were mostly trading below $1,000 and $12, respectively.In this regard, “Bitcoin Jesus” Roger Ver recently told Cointelegraph that the recent bear market “feels like the opposite of a crash,” since “BTC is up 58% for the last year, and 1048% for the last two years.”In the bearish marketplace, various experts have suggested different scenarios for the dynamics of crypto prices at the end of 2018. In late August, Fundstrat’s Tom Lee claimed that the BTC “could end the year explosively higher,” citing a correlation between it and emerging markets and predicting that Bitcoin’s price could surge to as high as $25,000 this year.In July, Alexis Ohanian, co-founder of both Reddit and VC firm Initialized Capital reiterated his stance that Bitcoin and Ethereum will be trading at $20,000 and $1,500 by the end of 2018, respectively.Also in July, Julian Hosp, co-founder and president of crypto startup TenX claimed that he was still “quite confident” that Bitcoin can hit $60,000 in 2018."

... cryptocurrencies with nothing behind [them], for example, Bitcoin [.","Sep 29, 2018","Russia has been trying to pass cryptocurrency legislation since the beginning of January 2018, with no success as of yet. The government’s main bill, “On Digital Financial Assets,” which was expected to be passed by July 1 — according to the wishes of President Vladimir Putin — will instead most likely be pushed back until an October Duma session.","According to Artem Tolkachev, the self-proclaimed “first” lawyer in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) to begin working with Bitcoin (BTC) and blockchain startups, the reason the crypto bills didn’t make it on the July agenda was “because of the complexity of the subject and lack of consensus over the state authorities about how and what they should regulate.”The problems arising within Russia over how to regulate cryptocurrencies have taken the form of conflicts between the Russian Central Bank’s more conservative stance and the Ministry of Economic Development’s willingness to embrace a new technology with the hope of attracting more business to the country.Tolkachev, who has been chairman of the Russian Blockchain.community since 2016 and founded the Blockchain Lab at Deloitte CIS, said that the current version of the crypto and blockchain legislation — which takes its form in three draft bills — has not lived up to his expectations.Speaking to Cointelegraph, Tolkachev said that “of course” he is “disappointed by the current version of the regulation,” noting that the three bills — “On Digital Financial Assets,” regulation of the central bank on crowdfunding (including Initial Coin Offerings (ICO) and amendments to the Russian Civil Code — were prepared independently, which makes their legislation “rather ineffective.”Tolkachev added,“I spent around two years discussing with the central bank, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Economic Development, the general security service and all [the] other guys [about] how we can regulate this stuff. And I was trying to sell the idea […] that we can be the country who attracts that kind of business and have the crypto-friendly environment here. Unfortunately, we have what we have. What can I say? That’s it.”Yuri Pripachkin, the president of the Russian Association of Cryptocurrency and Blockchain (RACIB), told Cointelegraph that the group was also consulted during the formation of the cryptocurrency bill, but that the bill still contains some unfavorable terms. According to Pripachkin, the Russian cryptocurrency bill in its current form is “far behind the ones which were accepted in Belarus, Kazakhstan and many other countries like Singapore, Switzerland.”At the end of January 2018, the first variant of a Russian crypto bill was presented by Russia’s Ministry of Finance (MinFin). The bill on the digital economy included a framework for the regulations surrounding crypto and blockchain-related technology — like smart contracts, mining and ICOs. Russia’s central bank was also preparing a draft law on crowdfunding.Tolkachev clarified that the draft laws are “not creating regulation for existing cryptocurrencies and tokens,” but are specifically aimed at newly created ICOs:“According to these draft laws, none of the existing cryptocurrencies, especially cryptocurrencies with nothing behind [them], for example, Bitcoin [...] will be allowed in Russia. It wouldn’t be under the scope of this legislation at all. According to the three bills, we can talk only about some kind of asset-based tokens, not about cryptocurrency.”This first variation of the bill was originally opposed by the Bank of Russia, according to local news outlet TASS, which reported at the time that the central bank disagreed with the way transactions between crypto, rubles and foreign currencies were laid out. However, MinFin noted that any sort of legislative ban on crypto transactions will “lead to the creation of conditions for the use of such currency for illegal purposes.”Pripachkin told Cointelegraph that “MinFin and [the] central bank, they can't find the golden middle, because they've got different opinions in terms of cryptocurrency legislation, so it affects [the] legislative process.”At the end of February, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that crypto regulation should become law no later than July 1, 2018. At this time, Russia’s central bank still wanted to criminalize ICO token investments, while MinFin was insisting on just regulation, according to local news outlet Parlamentskaya Gazeta. The outlet quoted Anatoly Aksakov, Chairman of the State Duma Committee on Financial Markets, who commented on the central bank’s position:“The central bank has come out against the legalization of this kind of digital currency inasmuch as citizens could then actively invest in instruments without considering possible risks.”Tolkachev noted that the state authorities like the Ministry of Economic Development are “much more about creating a good environment for business, for attracting new business,” and thus think the regulation should be changed from the current draft bills. On the other hand, Tolkachev notes that the central bank and the Minister of Finance are the “really conservative guys who don’t really want to see cryptocurrencies.”In March of this year, a group of Russian deputies headed by the Chairman Aksakov submitted the first draft of legislation on cryptocurrencies and ICOs to the State Duma, as well as a draft of the bill “On Alternative Methods of Fundraising (Crowdfunding).”This draft defines cryptocurrencies and tokens as digital assets, with trading only allowed through authorized cryptocurrency exchanges, and establishes KYC regulations for ICOs. Digital assets are also defined as property, not as a legitimate means of payment in the Russian Federation. This March version differs from the initial January variant in that it now echos crypto exchange requirements in United States — i.e., the verification of accounts for anti-money laundering (AML) and counter terrorist financing (CTF) purposes.Tolkachev noted the problem with the bills were their references to “basic Russian AML/KYC rules,” as they “may not be effective for tracing and monitoring transactions with crypto assets.”The March bill also suggests the maximum limit of an individual investment in ICOs be defined by Russia’s central bank rather than the January-suggested 50,000 rubles (about $800).January’s disagreement between the central bank and MinFin had been solved in March, according to local news outlet Ria Novosti, with the Bank of Russia noting that it will be considered permissible to exchange rubles, foreign currencies or property for tokens issued by Russian ICOs, while it will not be allowed to use cryptocurrencies due to the possibility of “questionable transactions.”Also in March, Igor Sudets, a member of the Duma’s expert panel on the digital economy and blockchain, said that due to the proposed bill’s limit on domestic investment in Russia ICOs, investors may not want to conduct Russian ICOs, according to Forklog:“I very much hope that [ICO investment specifications] will be substantially finalized for the second reading. Because otherwise, nobody will want to conduct ICOs in Russian jurisdiction, since the main goal — to raise money — will be unattainable.”In April, a review of the draft crypto bill added that the exchange of crypto for fiat of more than 600,000 rubles (about $9,500) or its foreign equivalent would fall under mandatory currency exchange regulation.Pripachkin said that RACIB is currently working to create additions to the bill that can be proposed to the Duma, and hopes that the Russian officials will take the changes into consideration:“For now, we’re working on preparation of some kind of tips, we really hope that they are going to hear us, according to these remarks we are preparing [...] legal bodies should really understand that if they are going to accept the law which is not in the interested of such industry, then this industry is not going to survive.”He noted that he does believe that the drafts “are going to be accepted and implemented later on.” Otherwise, in Pripachkins’ opinion:“None of the foreign investors will come, and what is more — the local industries could leave the country.”The problems that Pripachkin sees in the bill are that there is not a lot of clarity “in terms of the mechanism of ICOs, nor about crypto exchanging licensing,” but he does note that mining is noted as being classified as an entrepreneurial venture for taxation and VAT purposes.The most recent version of the bill was approved by the State Duma in its first reading on May 22 in an almost unanimous vote — 410 for and one against.However, on Sept. 19, Russian news outlet Vedomosti reported on an updated version of the bill, which no longer contains a definition for “cryptocurrency,” and where mining is defined as the “release of tokens to attract investment in capital.” In the previous version of the bill, mining was the extraction of cryptocurrencies.The bill does not make digital currencies a legitimate means of payment. Instead, the central bank, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Development will create separate guidelines for these currencies to be used as payment in “controlled quantities.” The bill also makes a digital confirmation by a user in a smart contract legally equivalent to their written consent.And, while crypto exchanges don’t fall under the scope of the bills’ legislation, Tolkachev noted that Russians can still trade in crypto through peer-to-peer (p2p) transactions in a “so-called ‘grey zone.’” In a separate comment with Vedomosti, Tolkachev underlines that the draft law does not regulate transactions with cryptocurrencies. Russia’s Federal Financial Monitoring Service notes that crypto exchange operators are subject to Article 5 of Federal Law 115-FZ (AML and CTF) or they will lose their license.Pripachkin told Cointelegraph that the “Russian crypto industry and crypto economy is headed [down] the best path […] It’s not a problem for us that we are restricted by legislation in Russia. But, of course we would love to have the first [legislative norms] in the world.”At the beginning of September, Dmitry Peskov, a special representative of the Russian president, said that Russia was not ready for the circulation and issuance of cryptocurrencies, as it “contradicts the basic functions of government.” Peskov notes that the best way forward to develop the cryptocurrency sphere legally in the country is to create a regulatory sandbox to analyze the different aspects of the crypto industry.To this end, the Central Bank of Russia also announced on Sept. 11 the successful test of an ICO trial conducted with Sberbank and the National Settlement Depository.More recently, on Sept. 15, a lobby group of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs (RSPP) announced that they were also working on an alternative crypto regulation bill in order to clarify the supposed contradictions in the existing bill “On Digital Financial Assets.” This new bill is set to be developed by Russian businessmen, including two of the richest businessmen in the country: Vladimir Potanin, of the nickel and palladium mining and smelting company Nornickel, and Viktor Vekselberg, head of the Russian innovation fund Skolkovo.Elina Sidorenko, the vice president of RSPP, explained that the new version of the alternative bill will divide digital assets into three groups: tokens, which will be equivalent to securities, cryptocurrencies, and digital ‘signs.’ Sidorenko, who didn’t clarify what “digital ‘signs’” entailed, noted:“Cryptocurrencies will have a special status, which has never appeared in Russian legislation before, and will be regulated on the basis of laws and regulations that will be issued by the Russian Central Bank. The central bank will issue licenses for exchange operations. In this regard, the status of crypto owners will be notably facilitated in comparison to securities owners.”If approved by members of the RSPP, the bill can then be then discussed with Russian officials in October.In mid-September, cryptocurrency exchange Huobi joined Russia’s VEB Innovation Fund to share notes on crypto regulation and help create ""a legal basis that could compete with current promising jurisdictions.""Although President Putin himself instigated the now-passed deadline for cryptocurrency regulation, the country’s leader has still not made any clear, definitive statements about the future of cryptocurrency in Russia.However, cryptocurrency was mentioned during President Putin’s most recent live Q&A “Direct Line” with the public, where he spoke relatively negatively — albeit vaguely — about cryptocurrencies and their use cases, noting that they work partially in Japan but not in any other countries.Tolkchev believes that the reason Putin chose to speak about crypto in “Direct Line” is the lack of consensus between the regulator and the state authorities,“That’s why if he answers something, in some way, it would be something like a direct order to the regulators and the state authorities. I think he just doesn’t want to do it right now because a lot of discussions are taking place over this topic.”Pripachkin added that Putin was just repeating the position of the central bank, and that RACIB in their proposed amendments to the crypto bill is “working on explanations [on] why they're thinking somehow in the wrong way [...] [and] trying to clarify the fears of the central bank.”Cryptocurrency use to avoid sanctions has become a topic worldwide after Venezuela, a country under international sanctions, created its oil-backed government cryptocurrency, the Petro, earlier this year.In January, Sergei Glazyev, economic adviser to President Putin, said that a Russian government-created “CryptoRuble” would be able to alleviate some economic pressure caused by Western sanctions.However, Tolkachev doesn’t think that Russia will be looking to cryptocurrencies to avoid sanctions anytime soon, especially as the CryptoRuble is “still nothing but a rumor that’s been denied a number of times by various state authorities”:“I think from the [state’s] perspective, it’s not a very safe way to use some kind of cryptocurrencies which [the] state doesn’t control, to rely on it as a main source of dealing with the sanctions […] As far as I understand the current agenda, it’s not on the list, we can’t use crypto to beat the sanctions.”On the other hand, Pripachkin was confident that the CryptoRuble project will eventually be implemented:“This project will be created. Sergey Glazyev is highly advanced in economics, and he understands what he is talking about.”But Tolkachev does think that Russia will continue to see cryptocurrencies as something to have control over, as that has been the Russian mentality for the past “10 years”:“Russia and the Russian mentality of the last 10 years was about competing with the [rest of the] world and building something of our own. And of course the Russian government would like to have a control over the internet, over [...] cryptocurrencies [...] For such kind of situation where a lot of people are involved, a lot of new technology involved, the government would like to have a little bit more pressure than other countries because of the paradigm in which we are living.”"

The fundraising campaign was managed by a group of jihadists called Mujahideen Shura Council and aimed to raise $2,500 per fighter, giving an option to pay in Bitcoin (BTC). The group reportedly gained “a little over $500 in Bitcoin.”Another example addresses a militant group in Syria called Malhama Tactical, which sought to raise funds on Twitter. The group was found by an Uzbek who served in the Russian military before leaving to join rebels in Syria in 2013. The campaign reportedly received a few transactions and contained less than $100 worth of BTC.Fanusie further explained that managing large amounts of cryptocurrencies requires specific skills, such as being “extremely savvy in cyber security, ” which terrorists may currently lack. He added that price volatility and vulnerability to hackers make the use of crypto a “fringe activity both among the general public and within the population of global jihadists.”"

But how is the rest of the Central Asia region is holding up?","The list below is based on thorough news research, but should in no way be considered complete. If you have more detailed information on banks and the crypto relationship in your country, we encourage you to share it in the comment section.RegulationKazakhstan has clearly shown its interest in cryptocurrencies. According to a study published by the search engine Yandex in March, locals have been searching for crypto-related terms in frequency and the amount is several times higher this year as compared to 2017.However, a definite regulatory framework has yet to be introduced in the country. There are signs that this situation might change in the near future, however: In May, Kazakhstan’s president, Nursultan Nazarbayev, called for global cooperation in terms of crypto regulation.Nazarbayev stressed that “most countries are actively exploring the possibility of adapting cryptocurrency to the current configuration of financial systems,” adding:“At the same time, we see completely separate actions of states in this issue. And these disparate actions will lead to inefficiency. It is necessary to start developing common rules.”The president’s comment followed the National Bank of Kazakhstan’s (NBK) announcement that they are going to ban crypto trading and mining in the country. On March 30, CBK head Daniyar Akishev declared in an interview with RIA Novosti:“In Kazakhstan, the National Bank is very conservative toward [cryptocurrencies], I welcome only relatively tight regulations. To elaborate, we want to prohibit buying and selling of cryptocurrencies with the national currency, we want to ban exchanges on this field, we want to ban any kind of mining.”Akishev cited investor protection, Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know-Your-Customer (KYC) measures as primary reasons behind a potential blanket ban on cryptocurrencies. He added that NBK’s point of view is shared by “the majority of public authorities” in Kazakhstan and that his agency has already “prepared” amendments to the law.BlockchainKazakhstan is actively trying to become the region’s main blockchain hub: In June, the country’s capital, Astana, held “the most important event for fintech in Central Asia” — a large blockchain conference supported by some public authorities and the Kazakh Association for Blockchain and cryptocurrencies (KABC).KABC was registered in November 2017 by at least six organisations, some of which are led by people who previously worked at local regulating bodies. The coalition's chairman has previously stated that their primary goal is to “define the rules for crypto and blockchain’s market jointly with the watchdog.”Some of the country's public authorities have already started researching crypto’s underlying technology. Thus, in April, the Ministry of Finance announced it was going to launch a blockchain-powered database, while a local cluster of innovation teamed up with IBM to study how the IT giant’s Hyperledger Fabric could be implemented for the local economy.  Kyrgyzstan explicitly banned cryptocurrencies back in July 2014, when the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic issued a statement warning that the use of Bitcoin and other virtual currencies as a form of payment is illegal under the national law:""Under the legislation of the Kyrgyz Republic, the sole legal tender on the territory of our country is the national currency of Kyrgyzstan som. The use of 'virtual currency,' Bitcoins, in particular, as a means of payment in the Kyrgyz Republic will be a violation of the law of our state.""The central bank also warned the citizens about Bitcoin’s lack of regulation and high levels of volatility. Around the same time, a Bitcoin ATM machine was installed in Bishkek by Italian financial analyst Emanuele Costa, who argued that the ATM could greatly impact the way migrant workers in Kyrgyzstan send money back home. According to the World Bank, migrant remittances from 2013 totaled 31 percent of Kyrgyzstan's GDP.Despite the central bank’s harsh stance on crypto, virtual currencies are present in the country. As Valery Tutykhin, head of the International Finance Centre Development Agency, told local news agency 24.kg, investing in cryptocurrencies is possible in Kyrgyzstan:“Our local investment market infrastructure can be used to legally invest into any crypto assets. Does someone want to buy cryptocurrencies? Let him do it through the local commodities exchange, and he will pay local taxes. Does someone want to raise capital for a startup through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO)? Let him do it through the local stock exchange. Its listing rules are not so complex.”Blockchain Despite the regulatory uncertainty, the Kyrgyz Republic has proven to be blockchain-friendly. According to a March report dubbed “The Legal Status of Blockchain Technology in Kyrgyzstan” that was commissioned by the Kyrgyz Stock Exchange and the International Finance Centre Development Agency and prepared by Geneva-based law firm John Tiner & Partners, the law of Kyrgyzstan does not prohibit or hinder the development of blockchain-based projects, including cryptocurrency mining and trading. Specifically, the Kyrgyz Stock Exchange has been developing a blockchain-backed project to facilitate trade securities and make real-time settlements. Moreover, in April, the State Patent Office of Kyrgyzstan (KyrgyzPatent) announced that it will digitize patent records and create a blockchain-powered database with the help of the Russian National Intellectual Property Transactions Coordination Center (IPChain).RegulationCryptocurrencies are neither legal nor banned in Tajikistan. However, in January the National Bank of Tajikistan (NBT) voiced its opinion regarding the issue for the first time, calling Bitcoin “a terrorism financing tool.”“Being based on experience of financial institutions, the National Bank warns nationals of Tajikistan of risks related to use of Bitcoins,” NBT declared in a written reply to Radio Liberty’s Tajik Service.BlockchainWhile the government of Tajikistan seems to ignore the technology, there are some blockchain projects in the country. Specifically, in June 2017, Hong Kong-based blockchain startup Bitspark teamed up with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to study the potential for blockchain remittances as a way to improve financial inclusion in Tajikistan.According to Bitspark research, Tajikistan remains an underbanked country, as an estimated 85 percent to 90 percent of the population do not have formal banking accounts. Instead, they rely on alternative services for domestic and international payments, an area where blockchain has shown some progress.RegulationThere’s no concrete information regarding virtual currencies’ legal status in Turkmenistan. According to responses posted on a thread on a Russian mining forum, where the opening poster asked whether it was possible to buy cryptocurrencies in Turkmenistan, even the over-the-counter (OTC) markets are barely present in the region. Reportedly, virtual currencies there can only be bought with U.S. dollars, but the government has been actively limiting access to foreign currency for local companies and citizens.RegulationRecently, Uzbekistan has introduced a number of positive regulation laws for the local crypto industry, namely recognizing trading and mining, as well as exempting local crypto traders from taxation.The country’s president, Shavkat Mirziyoyev, has signed a law legalizing the activities of crypto exchanges, which came into force on Sept. 2. According to the decree, foreign nationals can only trade cryptocurrencies in Uzbekistan by means of creating a subsidiary in the country. The law also specifies a minimum capital requirement of roughly $710,000 to register a crypto exchange.Moreover, crypto traders will not be subject to Uzbek stock market regulations and will be relieved of their obligation to pay taxes on trading revenues.Under the new legislation, crypto exchanges must also comply with counterterrorism and AML laws. They are also bound to store information on crypto transactions, clients' personal data and their correspondences for five years.BlockchainThe local government has not ignored blockchain, either. In September, President Mirziyoyev also ordered the establishment of a state blockchain development fund titled the ""Digital Trust,"" according to a document published on the official government website.The fund's primary goal is to integrate blockchain into various government projects, including healthcare, education and cultural areas. The organization will also be responsible for international investment in the Uzbek digital economy. The Digital Trust will reportedly be funded by the National Agency of Project Management, in addition to international loans and grants.Furthermore, in July, Mirziyoyev signed the order ""On measures for digital economics development in the Republic of Uzbekistan."" The document makes provisions for blockchain to be integrated into local public administration."

it the “first traditional stock offering ever to accept investments” in ...","Sep 11, 2018","Last week, at least two crypto-related enterprises, a Silicon Valley stock and cryptocurrency trading platform Robinhood and Singapore-based crypto exchange Huobi, moved closer to going public by holding an initial public offering (IPO).","The ‘old school’ way to collect investments might seem especially attractive in the context of mass adoption trends and a declining ICO market, which now sees its hardest slump in 16 months. But what is an IPO exactly, and which crypto-related companies have chosen to go public?For those who know what an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) is, the concept of initial public offering (IPO) — a more traditional way for a company to seek investments from broader audience in the public market — should seem familiar. The main difference between the two is that an ICO gives out tokens — whose use case is based on the company’s performance — while an IPO gives investors stock ownership in a company.An IPO, or stock market launch, is when a company sells its shares to institutional investors and retail (individual) investors. This process is significantly more regulated compared to the ICO market: An IPO has to be supervised by regulators — like the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) — and be underwritten by one or more investment banks. The so-called ‘underwriters’ manage the process, negotiate with the SEC and help its client get listed on a stock exchange. In the end, they collect commision on the raised funds.Once the company gets listed on a stock exchange, say the NASDAQ in New York, it goes public — i.e., its shares are traded freely in the open market. Importantly, the company is now bound to comply with the watchdogs and keep its investors in the loop by publishing information regarding internal operations.Holding a successful IPO includes a number of potential benefits, like attracting capital from a larger amount of investors, diversifying equity base and increasing the overall exposure and prestige of the company. Consequently, there are disadvantages as well, some of which include risks which include not enough capital being raised, legal costs and the requirement to disclose sensitive financial information.Normally, ICOs allow investors to pay with crypto — usually Ethereum (ETH) — hence remaining somewhat anonymous, while IPO investors are limited to fiat money. However, in August, marijuana culture media group High Times Holding Corp. announced it would accept Bitcoin (BTC) and ETH in its upcoming IPO, making it the “first traditional stock offering ever to accept investments” in digital currencies. Despite the SEC later claiming that High Times will not be supporting cryptocurrencies as payment for shares, the media representative Jon Cappetta has since confirmed that the company is, in fact, technically accepting BTC and ETH as payment options, although now the digital money will be converted into U.S. dollar by a third-party company to meet the SEC’s requirements.Beside the traditional IPOs described in the section above, there are some alternative ways for a company to go public — namely the reverse IPO and Dutch IPO.A reverse IPO, or a reverse takeover, is a way to bypass at least some of bureaucratic scrutiny involved in the process and go public with less hassle. To conduct a reverse IPO, a private company should buy enough shares to control a publicly traded company (also referred to as the shell). After that, the shareholders of the private company merge the shell company with their enterprise and exchange their shares for a majority of the shares of the public company.At that point, they have gone public without having to go through the aforementioned process of a traditional IPO. In countries like the U.S., such a company will still have to disclose the information regarding the deal to the SEC, however “there are no registration requirements under the Securities Act of 1933 as there would be for an IPO,” as the regulator mentions on its website. Moreover, if the reverse-merger company’s securities are listed and traded on an exchange, the listed company must still meet the exchange’s initial listing standards to qualify for listing — however, the overall process is still much cheaper and faster in the end.Dutch IPOs, in turn, are more similar to ICOs — they represent a way to raise money directly from the public instead of holding a conventional IPO, where investment banks would take their cut in the process.During a Dutch IPO, as per Investopedia, potential investors submit their bids for the number of shares they want to buy and the price they are willing to pay for them. Once the bids are entered, “the allotted placement is assigned to the bidders from the highest bids down, until all of the allotted shares are assigned.” The price is based on the last successful bid. Perhaps the largest company at least remotely related to crypto that has gone public through a Dutch IPO is Patrick Byrne’s Overstock.com.Although the majority of crypto firms still rely on ICOs — as Block.one’s June offering showed — investors are still ready to pump record-breaking amounts of money into an unreleased product, and some of the players have already gone public through IPOs.An apparent first was almost secured by an Australian-based Bitcoin mining firm Bitcoin Group Ltd., who was set to become the world’s first crypto firm to be traded on a stock exchange. It submitted its first prospectus to the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) back in 2015, and after a series of delays caused by the Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) interference, raised a modest 5.9 million Australian dollars during its IPO, severely missing its AU$20 million goal. The ASX then raised concerns regarding Bitcoin Group’s capital, and the company chose to withdraw from the stock market.Since then, the ASX has seen at least two more successful crypto-related applications: A fintech startup Kyckr, which uses blockchain for its corporate identity management platform, was listed on the stock exchange in 2016 after raising $5.2 million; and Identitii, a blockchain-based software outfit that helps financial institutions exchange payment information, which was listed on the ASX after its $11 million IPO in August 2018. While it is yet unclear how Identitii will perform, Kyckr shares are now being traded at 12 cents, despite being initially sold for 20 cents.Another country that has hosted crypto-related IPOs is the United Kingdom. Back in December 2015, Coinsilium, a firm which provides advisory services to blockchain projects, was listed on the ISDX Growth Market in London, becoming the world’s first blockchain company to float, according to Financial Times. Coinsilium issued 10,000,000 ordinary shares at approximately 13 cents per share and raised one million pounds ($1,3 mln) in gross proceeds, becoming “the world's first IPO of a blockchain technology company,” as Cameron Parry, Coinsilium's executive chairman, commented on the news. The company's shares trade at approximately 9 cents as of press time.Moreover, in August 2018, mining firm Argo Blockchain PLC, which offers customers the ability to mine four cryptocurrencies — Bitcoin Gold (BTG), Ethereum (ETH), Ethereum Classic (ETC) and Zcash — became the first crypto company to join the London Stock Exchange (LSE), raising around $32 million for a total valuation of about $61 million. It sold a total of 156,250,000 ordinary shares that represented 53.2 percent of the firm’s issued share capital at around 21 cents per share. Argo’s stock shares are being sold for approximately 23 cents, as of press time.The biggest player to join the IPO race might be Bitmain, an extremely successful Chinese mining company with around $3.5 billion in profit generated in 2017 — arguably one of the most influential businesses in the industry. Specifically, Bitmain develops high-grade Bitcoin mining hardware and has huge mining capabilities.In June, media started to report that Jihan Wu, the co-CEO of Bitmain, was planning to conduct an overseas IPO in a market with U.S. dollar denominated shares — like Hong Kong — as it would allow early backers to cash in funds.Later in July, a research unit for crypto exchange BitMEX analyzed leaked data on Bitmain’s potential IPO and stated that the mining giant had conducted a pre-IPO round that allegedly raised around $14 billion, leading them to believe that it could raise no less than $20 billion at the IPO stage.Nevertheless, as Cointelegraph reported earlier, there had been a lot of rumors and uncertainty around Bitmain’s upcoming IPO. For instance, though DST Global and Japan’s SoftBank were initially listed among possible investors, they have since denied their involvement. Nevertheless, if Bitmain IPO ever does happen, it’s likely to affect the crypto industry simply due to the scale of the operation.Still, Bitmain might be outraced by some of its compatriots: Both Canaan Creative, China’s second-largest BTC mining hardware manufacturer, and its competitor Ebang Communication have announced their plans to conduct IPOs on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEx), which is yet to list crypto-related stocks. Interestingly, both Canaan’s and Ebang’s estimated goal is $1 billion, which is still modest compared to Bitmain’s whooping $20 billion.Significantly, to accommodate the rising amount of fintech-based IPOs, the HKEx announced in August a new blockchain-powered private market. Called the HKEx Private Market, it focuses on helping smaller startups get their financing through pre-IPOs before entering the bigger market and facing the regulators’ supervision. It is set to be launched by the end of the year, according to the stock exchange’s chief executive Charles Li:“We plan to launch a completely new venture called the HKEX Private Market in 2018 to provide early stage companies and their investors with a share registration and transfer platform based on blockchain technology so they can conduct pre-IPO financing and other activities on an off-exchange venue not under the regulatory remit of the Securities and Futures Ordinance. The Private Market will serve as a ‘nursery’ for early stage companies before they are ready to enter public markets.”On Aug. 29, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEx) announced that Huobi had acquired controlling stock interest in Hong Kong-based electronic products manufacturing firm Pantronics Holdings Ltd.Huobi reportedly seized an overall stake of 71.67 percent in Pantronics, alongside blockchain services provider platform Fission Capital — at a breakdown of 66.26 percent and 5.41 percent respectively.Huobi’s purchase had the apparent signs of being a reverse IPO. However, Sandy Peng, a partner at Fission Capital, told Cointelegraph that “for the time being, this is a straight forward acquisition [...] As stated in the announcement, Huobi intends to start new blockchain-related businesses using this entity.”Indeed, the reverse IPO way, despite being cheaper and faster, has not proven to be fruitful for crypto companies: On Aug. 1, when crypto evangelist Mike Novogratz’s crypto-focused merchant bank Galaxy Digital made its trading debut on Toronto’s TSX Venture Exchange, the largest stock exchange in Canada, it shares plunged 20 percent.Lacking the two years’ of audited financials required for a U.S. IPO, Novogratz instead acquired a Canadian crypto start-up Coin Capital, which he then merged with an already TSX-listed Canadian shell company Bradmer Pharmaceuticals.  Before approving the listing, Canadian regulators subjected the firm to close scrutiny and pushed back its trading debut from April to August, during which a protracted downtrend in the crypto markets saw BTC below $6,000.The U.S. SEC advises investors to be extra cautious when investing in the stocks of reverse merger companies.In September, Techcrunch reported that Robinhood, a stock and cryptocurrency trading platform with five million customers, was looking for a chief financial officer (CFO) to navigate the company through the path to an IPO. The Silicon Valley startup is already undergoing a series of audits from the SEC and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) to ensure regulatory compliance.Coinsquare, one of Canada’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, is aiming to hold an $120 million IPO in September to facilitate overseas growth, according to the Bloomberg report. Interestingly, Coinsquare plans to sell its shares on the main Toronto Stock Exchange, “in contrast to several crypto companies which have used a shortcut to list on Canada’s junior TSX Venture Exchange in recent months via reverse takeovers,” as the media points out.Interestingly, Coinsquare chief executive officer Cole Diamond insisted that Coinsquare was not taking the reverse IPO route, saying:“Hell no. We believe that there are a tremendous amount of low-quality deals going public.”Another major America-based crypto exchange, Coinbase, which has a reputation for being fully compliant with regulators, has also been flirting with the idea of holding an IPO since December 2017, but is yet to disclose any concrete details on going public. Meanwhile, all eyes are on Bitmain and its competitors, who are racing to enter the blockchain-friendly Hong Kong market."

Draper stated that once people become more familiar with the technology, it would transform many important industries globally:“I think it’s going to have such a transformative effect on industries that we never even imagined would be transformable. The internet went after industries that were $10–100 billion dollar markets, cryptocurrency will go after trillion dollar markets — these are finance, healthcare and insurance, banking and investment banking, and governments.”In January 2018, Barron’s reported that the Russell 3000 Index — which accounts for 98.5 percent of the entire U.S. stock market — was worth $30 trillion. The “staggering” amount of money followed a successful year in 2017, in which the market experienced 22 percent returns.Draper also compared the current state of the crypto market with the early days of Internet, saying:“The internet started in the same way, it came in big waves and then it kind of came crashing down, and then the next wave comes concentrated but much bigger, and I suspect the same thing will go on here (with Bitcoin).”Brian Kelly of CNBC’s Fast Money compared cryptocurrency to the “Internet in the 1980s” as well, pointing out that Bitcoin (BTC) is still in its early stages. Kelly asserted that while he used to see crypto as comparable to the Internet in 1995, he now understands that a better comparison is further back. He added:“I think this technology is going to work, it’s going to be game changing, but it’s very early days, so we can have this massive volatility.”At press time, total crypto market capitalization is around $202 billion, according to CoinMarketCap."

It reportedly integrates “more than a billion transistors,” using a special circuit structure and low power-intensive technology to optimize efficiency. According to CEO Wu, tests have shown the chip “can achieve a ratio of energy consumption to the mining capacity that is as low as 42J/T.”Wu emphasized that as the industry matures, “exponential growth” in blockchain user traffic means that ever-greater processing power will be required to keep pace. He predicted that bleeding-edge computing technology development will also need to be integrated with blockchain to address the challenges facing the burgeoning industry.Just yesterday, Bitcoin mining software manufacturer Bitfury Group unveiled its own ASIC chip dubbed Bitfury Clarke, which the firm plans to integrate into a range of hardware, including its mining servers.In July, Cointelegraph reported that bearish crypto markets had negatively impacted the sale of ASIC chips, with a predicted price drop of 20 percent that month.

the most popular consensus protocol. Proof-of-stake (PoS). PoS was ...","Sep 13, 2018","In our Expert Takes, opinion leaders from inside and outside the crypto industry express their views, share their experience and give professional advice. Expert Takes cover everything from blockchain technology and ICO funding to taxation, regulation and cryptocurrency adoption by different sectors of the economy.","If you would like to contribute an Expert Take, please email your ideas and CV to george@cointelegraph.com.Although the blockchain and crypto communities remain united around the ideology of blockchain and its world-changing potential, there is still one issue which proves to be as divisive as a hard fork — consensus protocols. Although proof-of-work (PoW) is still the protocol of choice for Bitcoin and many others, the debate rages over proof-of-stake (PoS), along with other emerging consensus protocols.The granddaddy of consensus protocols and the brainchild of Satoshi, the proof-of-work protocol involves block miners solving complex cryptographic puzzles, for which they receive rewards in the form of coins or tokens.ProsAs the original protocol, PoW has proven its resilience against internal and external attacks.ConsPoW comes under fire for several reasons. It is highly energy intensive, with some estimates putting the Bitcoin network power consumption at the same level as 159 countries. Critics of Bitcoin such as Andrew Tayo have pointed out that much of this energy is wasted, as only one miner can eventually mine each block, regardless how many participate in the race to get there first.Bitcoin is now mostly mined using ASICs, so mining is dominated by big operations such as Bitmain, which can afford the hardware needed to mine at scale. This concentrates mining power into the hands of the few, leading some in the community to call Bitcoin a centralized currency. Although some crypto tokens such as Vertcoin attempt to remain ASIC-resistant by regularly changing algorithms, it is a race to stay ahead of the ASIC manufacturers.AdoptionBitcoin, Litecoin, Zcash and Ethereum Classic, among others — PoW is still the most popular consensus protocol.PoS was first conceived as a way of avoiding the well-known issues with PoW, such as energy consumption. In the PoS model, those holding coins can stake them on the likelihood of the next block being the correct one. If it is, they receive rewards. If someone stakes coins on a block that turns out to contain fraudulent transactions, they will be ‘fined’ the value of their stake.ProsPoS consumes less energy than PoW. PoS also actively penalizes dishonesty, deterring fraudulent behavior among validators.ConsAs the validating nodes are not contributing computational power — known as the ""nothing-at-stake"" problem — there is an increased risk that PoS blockchains could see more forks than in PoW. Additionally, PoS favors those with the most coins, which also promotes centralization as the richer holders can stake more. For PoS coin NXT, it has been shown how one holder could steadily increase their stake to the point that they would own more than 90% of coins.AdoptionProjects using a pure PoS algorithm are Reddcoin, Decred and NavCoin. The problems with PoW algorithms are what has led Ethereum to move away from pure PoW and adopt Casper, a PoW/PoS hybrid.Due to market domination by Bitcoin and Ethereum, the debate around consensus protocols often seems to center around PoW and PoS. In fact, they share similar problems, as indicated by Jordan Earls, co-founder and lead developer at Qtum:""The real dichotomy in the discourse of mining algorithms seems to come from the whole centralization vs. decentralization debate rather than if one should choose PoS or PoW. ASIC resistance has proven to be as stated, only resistant. This aspect has helped to incentivize the centralization of mining, leading some PoW networks to periodically change their mining algorithm in order to defeat this. In PoS networks, the case is similar, where some networks choose consensus mechanisms that have a technological limit on the number of validators, in hopes to offer greater transaction throughput.""However, we must remember that this is not a strict dichotomy — PoW and PoS are not the only consensus models. So what are some of the other options?Delegated PoS was invented by Daniel Larimer, co-founder of Steem and CTO of EOS, which both use dPoS. Here, the network votes for ‘Witnesses,’ who reach the consensus to add the next block. Similar to the standard PoS model, the voting weight of network participants is determined by the number of network tokens they hold.ProsdPoS increases latency, as fewer parties to a consensus speeds up decision making. By avoiding the use of ASICs, it promotes decentralization — but with some caveats, as outlined below.  ConsThe use of ‘Witnesses’ means that full decentralization is never achieved. Consider the difference between a full democracy — all citizens voting on all matters — and a representative democracy, where delegates are elected to speak on behalf of the electorate.Vitalik Buterin wrote a criticism of dPOS, describing how this consensus protocol can lead to plutocracy, with influential voters forming groups that could ultimately end in a malicious attack. Larimer responded in sharp defense with his own blog post titled “The Limits of Crypto-Economic Governance”:“Vitalik is looking for a crypto-economic blackbox that assumes you cannot rely on voting whether by stake (plutocracy) or by individual (democracy).”Larimer concluded with his view that consensus is the role of the network, and that “each community might have its own definition of ‘right and wrong,’ which can only be measured by a poll of the subjective opinions of community members.”AdoptiondPoS is used in all of Dan Larimer’s projects — namely BitShares, Steem and EOS.Similarly to dPoS, the proof-of-assignment model establishes several trusted nodes within the network, but only those nodes store the entire ledger. By allowing other network contributors to participate without ledger storage, the proof-of-assignment model allows any network-enabled device operating on the Internet of Things (IoT) to mine tokens. Called ‘micro-mining,’ this process enables internet-connected household appliances to contribute to the computing power of a blockchain network.ProsBy harnessing the computing power of a vaster network of machines, PoA can handle faster transaction speeds with a much-reduced energy consumption.ConsPoA is still in its infancy and needs to prove its resilience through the early phases until network adoption gains traction.AdoptionProof-of-assignment was developed by IOTW, a blockchain project aimed at bringing any internet-connected devices into the blockchain network. Fred Leung, founder and CEO of IOTW, explains:""The end goal here, in order to create mass blockchain adoption, is to bring blockchain into every household. PoA and micro-mining will allow any connected device to mine without adding hardware cost. Common people will get the blockchain rewards and so they will learn about blockchain and cryptocurrency. PoA uses very little power, since it does not need to compute proof-of-work. Micro-mining, with witnessing protocol, will allow [a] significant less number of ledgers with the same number [of] verification nodes.”Delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance was developed by the NEO team to overcome the Byzantine Generals Problem. The system is comprised of nodes, delegates (who can approve the blocks), and a speaker (who proposes the next block). Various scenarios illustrate how the dBFT protocol is robust enough to protect against malicious actors within the network.ProsMalcolm Lerider, senior R&D manager at NEO had this to say about the dBFT protocol:""dBFT is invented by NEO [previously called Antshares] and has proved to work well. It is a consensus algorithm developed with perfect finality, meaning that all transactions are 100 percent final after the first confirmation. The blockchain cannot fork with dBFT, and high-value chained transactions are trivial and executed much faster. It is built with regulatory and business use cases in mind.""ConsVitalik makes the point that 100 percent finality is always probabilistic, at least philosophically. However, the NEO blockchain has yet to suffer any transaction reversal that contradicts its claim that its algorithm offers perfect finality.AdoptiondBFT is used by NEO.Blockchain, as a technology, is still very much under development. It is, therefore, a natural consequence that the issue of the ‘right’ consensus protocol is still under debate. Many of the critical considerations — such as the extent of decentralization — go to the core of the spirit of blockchain as a technology. At least for now, there is no consensus on the right consensus protocol.Nikolai is a financial analyst and professional trader writing for Forbes, The Next Web and Investing.com.

right away.” Moreover, Cheapair's CEO stressed that Bitcoin might ...","Sep 19, 2018","On Sept. 14, the blockchain investment arm of United States-based e-commerce Bitcoin pioneer Overstock announced that the retailer’s clients can now purchase the cryptocurrency directly from its website. It became possible after its subsidiary Bitsy began a beta launch of its cryptocurrency wallet and exchange, marking another step in Overstock’s rich relationship with Bitcoin.","However, although Overstock first allowed its customers to pay with the cryptocurrency back in 2014, the e-commerce industry has yet to experience mass adoption. Meanwhile, Asian players are gathering to make an even greater push.In January 2014, Overstock, an online retailer led by a “scourge of Wall Street” and crypto enthusiast Patrick Byrne, became the first large stock company to accept Bitcoin. As Byrne recalls in an interview with Business Insider:“We were the first. The largest company accepting Bitcoin then was a $800,000 a year restaurant diner in Western Australia. We stepped up and started taking it — we were $1.4 billion. So I like to think we saved that community about five years in their adoption cycle.”Curiously, the pioneering transition for Bitcoin’s integration into mainstream e-commerce was somewhat accidental: In December 2013, Byrne mentioned to a journalist that his company might start accepting Bitcoin. “I said it off the top of my head,” Byrne later admitted. Soon after the interview, media outlets from all over the world started to report on Overstock’s potential move. That provoked Byrne to swiftly contact San Francisco-based crypto exchange and wallet Coinbase, and, in a matter of few weeks, they jointly introduced the Bitcoin payment option on Overstock.The initial payoff was worth it. “The implementation pays for itself a hundred times just by the press,” Byrne claims. The cryptocurrency community turned up to show their support: “Bitcoin users started to come to our site and buying a set of pillows or a bed just to show their support. We sold few hundred thousand just in two days after getting live.”Interestingly, Overstock shares have trended significantly close to BTC price ever since Byrne joined part of the crypto crowd. For instance, Overstock's stock rose four times between July and December of 2017, as Bitcoin grew more than sevenfold, and closed the year with an approximate gain of 200 percent. However, such reliance on Bitcoin has worked both ways for the company. In September, when Byrne had to sell 10 percent of his equity in the company in order to reinvest the proceeds in two investment projects and satisfy tax obligations, he wrote in a letter to investors:  “I am disappointed that when the deadline arrived for my sales this quarter, the stock had dropped (I sadly note that over the last 180 days the correlation between OSTK's and Bitcoin's daily movements has been 85.5 percent, and again warn people: We don't have significant holdings of Bitcoin).”Nevertheless, Byrne continues to rely on cryptocurrency and blockchain in his business. Most crypto-related projects are carried out by venture capital firm Medici Ventures. It was established within Overstock in 2014 to use the company’s money to invest in blockchain projects. Another Overstock blockchain subsidiary, tZERO, has plans to launch an ICO trading platform. It has already secured major institutional investments from Hong Kong-based private equity firm GSR Capital.Most recently, in September, Medici Ventures announced that its investment choice, Bitsy, had begun a limited launch of its cryptocurrency wallet and exchange. Due to the new integration, customers of Overstock received the option to purchase Bitcoin directly from the website.“Integrating with Bitsy will allow Overstock to take the next step in its cryptocurrency journey by allowing the company to offer Bitcoin for sale directly from the retail website,” Byrne stated in the press release.Even before Overstock, there were smaller online retailers paving the way for crypto. Back in 2013, a Canada-based e-commerce platform for online stores and retail point-of-sale systems called Shopify announced a Bitcoin payment option for its sellers. Back then it had a base of over 70,000 online stores. Introduced via a collaboration with BitPay service, the feature could be activated upon contacting Shopify’s team. BitPay is a global Bitcoin payment service provider headquartered in Atlanta. It was founded in May 2011 to provide mobile checkout services to companies that wanted to accept Bitcoin.“Due to the fact that it's a very new feature and not something we're ready to roll out to all stores just yet, you will need to contact me to have it enabled, and I may want to follow up with you for your feedback once you've been using it for a while, but it works,” its representative Brian Alkerton wrote on Nov. 9, 2013.In July 2014, Shopify expanded its crypto integration by announcing a partnership with Coinbase: “Coinbase offers a two-click checkout experience and simple refunds that make accepting Bitcoin payments easy and convenient. All Shopify merchants can currently use Coinbase to accept Bitcoin and anyone with a U.S. bank account can convert their Bitcoin to USD.”The users could now choose between the two service providers, who offered slightly different pricing models: BitPay reportedly charged a one percent transaction fee on casual sales and a zero percent fee for monthly subscribers at the time, while Coinbase charged zero percent standard transaction fees on up to $1 million in processing.Additionally, Shopify website mentions that “unlike processing credit cards, Bitcoin payments have low to no fees,” while frauds and chargebacks are allegedly non-existent due to the nature of blockchain. Moreover, the e-commerce platforms lists fast international payments and no Payment Card Industry (PSI) compliance as other other benefits for using cryptocurrencies on their platform. Shopify has not released any statistics on how often cryptocurrencies are used in their transactions. However, in 2014, after the first full year with crypto payment option, it reportedly earned $105 million in revenue, twice as much as it raised the year before.In November 2013, Calabasas-based company CheapAir became the first online travel agency in the world to accept Bitcoin as a form of payment for flight tickets. To introduce the option, CheapAir teamed up with Coinbase.“Bitcoin is really easy. You can do it in two clicks. It’s a much easier way to pay and it’s also much more secure,” CEO Jeff Klee stated in an interview with Fox at the time.When answering if his company is concerned about Bitcoin’s volatility, Klee declared that they feel “pretty insulated”: “The airlines don’t [accept] Bitcoin yet, so we have to pay them in U.S. dollars. When the sale comes in, we take the Bitcoins, [and] exchange them almost right away.”Moreover, Cheapair’s CEO stressed that Bitcoin might make the transaction between the company and customers cheaper, albeit on their end: “Consumers don’t know this, but there’s a three percent cost embedded into everything you buy. Bitcoin does not have those. The transaction fees are much lower.”By February 2014, the travel agency added the option to pay for hotels with the cryptocurrency, which was also a first for the industry.Relatively soon, one of Cheapair’s competitors followed its move. In June 2014, Expedia, a travel booking website owned by U.S.-based Expedia Group, joined the ranks of crypto-friendly businesses by announcing it would accept Bitcoin as a form of payment for hotel bookings, also via a partnership with Coinbase.Thus, U.S.-based retailers who chose to support Bitcoin have partnered up either with Coinbase or BitPay. Both of them have their specific benefits and shortcomings.In 2017, BitPay reported processing more than $1 billion in Bitcoin payments. “We've already grown our payments dollar volume 328 percent year-over-year from 2016,” the processor claimed. “Altogether, BitPay's merchants are receiving $110 million in Bitcoin payments per month.”In order to increase the application’s reach and popularity, BitPay announced support for Bitcoin Cash (BCH) in December 2017. A couple of weeks later, the company confused the crypto community: First, BitPay announced it would raise its minimum transaction amount to $100. However, just two days later, the company backpedalled, setting the value back at $5.In February 2018, a couple of years after securing its first customers among online retailers, Coinbase announced its further expansion into the world of e-commerce: The exchange and wallet service opened Coinbase Commerce, a service with the aim to assist more online retailers. It was reported that the new service could be integrated into a merchant’s checkout flow or added as a payment option on an e-commerce platform. Additionally, it supported Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum and Litecoin. The company announced in the press release:“Our mission at Coinbase is to create an open financial system, so we’ve designed this solution to serve merchants worldwide. Unlike previous merchant products we’ve offered, Coinbase Commerce is not a hosted service, so merchants have full control of their own digital currency.”Around the same time, Coinbase upgraded its policy, reportedly suspending “custodial” solutions for merchants. Soon after the announcement, Cheapair’s CEO Jeff Klee issued an open letter to customers, where he argued that the new policy will make accepting BTC more difficult.“Our intention at this point is to use BitPay as a processor [now]. We have had a great experience with them so far and our integration is largely complete. But our one giant concern is that Bitpay does not support ‘non-payment protocol wallets’ [wallets that aren’t BIP-70 compliant]. So if you do not have a compatible wallet, you would have to get one and use it as an intermediate stage for your Bitcoin payment,” Klee wrote.Interestingly, the Coinbase move could also be the reason why Expedia quietly stopped accepting Bitcoin circa June 10 (Expedia later confirmed to Cointelegraph that their business stopped accepting Bitcoin).Chinese online retailers have been more cautious to interact with cryptocurrencies, instead focusing on their underlying technology, blockchain, which echoes the local government’s politics.Thus, in 2016, at a conference in Shanghai, Alipay — an online payment platform of the Chinese e-commerce titan Alibaba — announced it may develop a cloud service platform based on blockchain.“The usage of the blockchain will grow with the transaction records stored in it,” Alibaba Group Vice President Gao Hongbing declared at the time.In May 2018, Alibaba founder Jack Ma famously stressed blockchain’s importance, while noting that his team “does not care” about Bitcoin.In the same speech, Ma stated that he strongly believes in blockchain’s potential to address issues of data privacy and security for society at all levels — governments, corporations and individuals — in an ""era of big data.” He also stressed that security is a top priority for the e-commerce conglomerate.In March, the concern came through with more blockchain-related news: Alibaba's T-Mall e-commerce platform began adopting the technology for its cross-border supply chain via a partnership with logistics company Cainiao, as per local news agency Xinhua. The collaboration will reportedly use blockchain to track goods’ country of origin, method of shipping, arrival port and customs report details.According to data published in late August by Chinese media outlet iPR daily, Alibaba has reached the top of a list that ranks entities by the number of blockchain-related patents filed to date; the e-commerce conglomerate has filed a staggering 90 blockchain patents, outracing even IBM.But Alibaba is not the only Chinese e-commerce outlet looking to adopt blockchain. In August 2018, another local retail giant, JD, introduced its own blockchain plans, as it revealed its new Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) platform — dubbed JD Blockchain Open Platform. The new tool aims to enable businesses to build, host and implement blockchain solutions without having to develop the technology from scratch. JD outlined a number of potential use cases for the platform:“The technology can help companies streamline operational procedures such as tracking and tracing the movement of goods and charity donations, authenticity certification, property assessment, transaction settlements, digital copyrights and enhance productivity.”While U.S. e-commerce companies seem to be lagging behind after a promising start — with a number of players dropping alternative payment options altogether — international players appear to be much more ambitious.In late August 2018, Daniel Shin, the founder of Ticket Monster (TMON), a major Korean mobile e-commerce marketplace which boasts a $4 billion in total sales, disclosed that he had raised $32 million from a number of investors — including Binance labs, OKEx and Huobi Capital — to build a stablecoin named Terra. According to Terra’s white paper, the protocol maintains a “stability reserve” made up of user deposits with rewards varied to ensure the system is over-reserved.As Shin explained to TechCrunch, Terra’s goal is to offer a new payment option which would allow for the bypass of existing payment networks like Visa, who take their cuts in the process. The use of the token will be stimulated through special discounts.Interestingly, Terra is off to a jumpstart, granted that the group backing the stablecoin, the Terra Alliance, includes e-commerce players as big as Woowa Brothers, Qoo10, Carousell, Pomelo and TIKI — combined, those companies make around $25 billion in sales. The token would be spendable at each of those services.Similarly, Japan’s largest e-commerce company Rakuten, with a market capitalization of over $12.5 billion, announced plans to launch its own cryptocurrency as part of a new blockchain-based loyalty program earlier this year.Called the Rakuten coin, the asset will allegedly serve as ‎a “borderless currency,” underlining Rakuten’s vision of differentiating itself from its online retail rivals, like Amazon, Alibaba or eBay. The company’s CEO Hiroshi Mikitani elaborated:“Basically, our concept is to recreate the network of retailers and merchants. We do not want to disconnect [them from their customers] but function as a catalyst. That is our philosophy, how to empower society, not just provide more convenience.”Additionally, in late August 2018, Rakuten revealed a 265 million yen ($2.4 million) deal to acquire domestic crypto exchange Everybody’s Bitcoin. The purchase will reportedly occur on Oct. 1. According to Rakuten, it has been “considering entry into the cryptocurrency exchange industry” as it believes ""the role of cryptocurrency-based payments in e-commerce, offline retail and in p2p [peer-to-peer] payments will grow in the future.""While the majority of crypto-friendly online retailers come from Asia, Latin America has been pushing for mass adoption: Via Varejo, one of the largest consumer electronics and home appliance retailers in Brazil, teamed up with blockchain payment service Airfox. Airfox is a mobile financial service launched in February 2018 in Boston, MA. Designed for emerging economies, it allows making fiat and blockchain payments via its AirToken (AIR) coin, an ERC-20-based token.Via Varejo is now integrating Airfox’s digital banking platform on its e-commerce platforms, as well as in nearly 1,000 of its offline shops. Customers will be able to purchase goods in Casa Bahia by paying directly via Airfox, or will be able to use microloans provided by the retail group.The press release outlines the importance of the collaboration for the mass adoption of blockchain-powered payment services, letting the platform “extend its mobile digital wallet to Via Varejo's national customer base and drive mainstream adoption.”"

The main outcome of the partnership is to launch a Fan Token Offering (FTO) that will give fans access to Saint-German club tokens, which come with voting rights and can also be representative of VIP status for their holders.The Socios platform is powered by chiliZ, a Malta-based sports blockchain venture that has already secured the support of major industry players, such as Binance and OKEx. In a previous correspondence with Cointelegraph, chiliZ CEO Alexandre Dreyfus said that the venture has raised $66 million in funding to date.One of the features that Socios hopes will prove popular is the ability for token holders to vote on club matters. Unfortunately for fans, the tokens will not come with the kind of authority to weigh in on transfers or to give insight on the goings-on of the corporate hierarchy. Fans will, however, be entitled to decide on “cosmetics” (choosing the club’s jersey color, the stadium anthem and logo), selected sporting aspects, such as Man of the Match, summer tours and friendlies matches.Fans who wish to use their new powers on executive decisions may be disappointed to find their authority remains decidedly tokenistic. Dreyfus notes that the purpose of the strategy is not to shake up football clubs’ corporate hierarchy but rather to maximize monetizing fan engagement via crypto.Token holders will be able to trade them on the socios.com marketplace, although only against the chiliZ native token ($CHZ). The FTO is reportedly due to take place before the start of the next football season.The platform aims to hit the ground running — and once it does, it doesn’t plan on stopping any time soon. Dreyfus wants to have hundreds of clubs on the platform, starting with the biggest first. Socios is already making exclusive, five-year deals with all the clubs they are signing in order to ensure they have time to develop their product to perfection. Dreyfus also stated that the interest they have raised since partnering up with PSG stands to benefit others in the crypto community:“Since we have announced our partnership with PSG, we have had a lot of people asking where they can buy the token. This will be very valuable for the crypto ecosystem, as we will have to partner with exchanges and fiat platforms to onboard these new users.”Although the most recent to do so, PSG is not the first club to dabble with blockchain and FCOs. The technology is gaining traction with major players in the industry, with Michael Owen launching his own cryptocurrency and Lionel Messi endorsing a blockchain smartphone. In January 2018, English Premier League football club Arsenal FC partnered with CashBet to launch its new cryptocurrency, CashBet Coin. This crypto initiative differs from that of PSG in the sense that CashBet Coin is specifically designed for iGaming. As has been revealed by the CEO of the project, Mike Reaves, the token “will improve the online experience for real money, casino, social, skill-based, esports and sports betting players through increased trust and transparency, faster payouts, reduced fees and dedicated player protection.”The two FCOs are part of a growing crypto movement taking hold in British football. One organization at the forefront of implementing both blockchain technology and cryptocurrency is the London Football Exchange. The organization is looking to reinvigorate the football sector by creating a system of “inter-related components,” comprising of sports, media, finance and foundations.Charles Pittar, Corporate CEO of the London Football Exchange, shed light on the organization’s aims:“Our vision is to allow football clubs to take advantage of the token funding economy for their financing needs by providing them with a tokenized financing infrastructure, which involves token-design and issuance services.”Pittar further explained:“The LFE aims to become a ‘one-stop shop’ for clubs of all sizes to raise capital via equity sales and also offer LFE contributors a wealth of fan experiences and social interaction.”The token will provide incentivizing investment opportunities for a global fan base that can be used both in the local market but also in participating partner venues and businesses. The more LFE token holders use their coins, the more LFE points they will receive. Token holders would also benefit from discounts and exclusive offers, though specific details of what these may be have not yet been disclosed.Blockchain, the technology upon which cryptocurrency relies, is designed to ensure absolute transparency. If properly implemented, this could bring a fresh and honest approach to the valuation of football clubs, which became a sensitive topic from the early 2000s when oligarchs from all over the world developed an interest in acquiring the football clubs and running them as the enterprises. While this model sounds like a norm in United States, European sports fans had no such experience before the 21st century.After the Glazer family completed a controversial takeover bid for Manchester United Football Club in 2005, a fan campaign called “Love United Hate Glazer” began. The group of Manchester United fans were angry that the finances behind the Glazer family’s controlling share takeover came largely from loans, meaning that the previously financially stable club would now be laden with debt, incurring interest payments of over £60 million per year. In August 2010, the Glazer family was unable to repay bondholders, resulting in the overall interest rising from 14.25 percent to 16.25 percent. The club’s overall debt exceeded its earnings by more than five times. Campaign activists began organizing nonviolent protests and distributing posters with their anti-Glazer slogans emblazoned across them.Soon after this, a group of wealthy fans dubbed the “Red Knights” met with Manchester United Supporters’ Trust and a number of investment banks with the view of buying back the Glazer family’s controlling interest. The group raised the Supporters’ Trust membership to over 100,000 to demonstrate the popular support for a fan takeover of the club. In spite of its noble intentions and the efforts of a core of dedicated activists, the bid essentially failed due to overinflated pricing and a lack of transparency in the sale process.The very nature of blockchain technology means that all information is publicly available and all entries can be traced back to those who made them. This kind of dynamic could stand fans in better stead to resist disastrous takeovers or to even launch bids to buy the club for themselves. All information would be readily accessible in the instance of a takeover bid and inflated pricing could become a thing of the past.The LFE argues that blockchain will prove beneficial for clubs and fans alike, thanks to the related brand association and exposure, helping less prestigious clubs more successfully float their shares on the stock market. Due to the truly international nature of football fandom, even small, obscure clubs can enjoy support from passionate groups around the world. The LFE hopes to use blockchain and cryptocurrency to bring together clubs and fans, while monetizing the process in the meantime.CEO Charles Pittar describes the model:“This global exposure will encourage fans from farther afield to build a portfolio of clubs in the same way we may buy stocks in London, New York and Tokyo.”Blockchain has already made its first notable impact on football club ownership. Italian Serie C club Rimini FC 1912 became the first club in the history of the game to be acquired through cryptocurrency. Gibraltar-based firm Quantocoin made the payment in a cryptocurrency of the same name for ownership of 25 percent of the team.The small British Overseas Territory of Gibraltar has already made a name for itself in the crypto world with an increasing number of businesses setting up shop there. The favorable tax rates on Gibraltar — affectionately known as The Rock — have allowed for the creation of an enviable business environment. However, due to United Kingdom’s stringent immigration laws, some players had difficulty setting up bank accounts once they had signed for local clubs. Premier Division Gibraltar United owner Pablo Dana saw an opportunity where others were put off by the maze of red tape. His solution: pay all the players in cryptocurrency. As of next season, all player contracts will stipulate that payment will be made exclusively in cryptocurrency.Dana says that crypto has allowed him to run his football club transparently while also providing him with a method of paying his players uniformly. The Italian-born owner also said that such a small club would not normally have been able to attract and keep foreign players under normal circumstances.Dana told Forbes about the island’s unique approach to regulation and fintech:“It was the first [place that] regulated betting companies 20 years back, when everyone was seeing them as horrible. They put compliance and Anti-Money Laundering regulations and created a platform — they have the intelligence to do the same with cryptocurrencies.”It's clear that cryptocurrency is set to make a big impact on the way that big business and club ownership transactions are carried out in football. However, the technology isn’t only providing solutions to the matter of club ownership. The transparent qualities of cryptocurrencies and blockchain have the potential to revolutionize the purchase of the most valuable and commonly traded aspect across the football industry: the players themselves.In 2006, two Argentine football players — Javier Mascherano and Carlos Tevez — arrived on the British Premier League side, joining West Ham, under dubious circumstances. Ostensibly, the two players had simply transferred from the Brazilian side, Corinthians. However, it turned out that the club had not actually owned the two players in the first place. Upon investigation, the footballers were actually owned by a group of companies. This wreaked havoc with the contracts that West Ham had drawn up and resulted in the club being fined an eye-watering £5.5 million. The fallout of the botched sale resulted in the abolition of third-party ownership in the Premier League.The implementation of blockchain in drawing up smart contracts for the purchase of football players could stop this kind of debacle from repeating itself. Given that the two players were owned by a consortium of companies, the ledger entry for the sale could be clearly and transparently tracked. Lu Zurawski, practice lead for retail banking at ACI Worldwide told The Independent:“The ledger entry for a single player could be divided into multiple shares, each capable of being sold individually to create a fractional ownership scheme. Depending on the type of ledger technology used, these shares would be tradable and could be bought and sold via exchanges — teal folding money being used in exchange for player tokens.”A blockchain-based ledger could do away with the days of murky corporate ownership of football players and could usher in a new era of transparency. In addition to dispelling the malingering presence of corruption that has besmirched the reputation of the game and the industry as a whole, blockchain technology would be able to create a clear, immutable record of ownership. This would create trust among players, fans and owners alike while giving all parties involved equal standing for future transactions. Ross Peet, managing partner at Yes&Pepper told The Independent:“If you follow that chain of thought to its ultimate conclusion, we could be entering Star Trek territory where the Tokenisation of Everything (TOE) will mean money becomes obsolete and we can exchange anything for anything. Next stop the stars. Proper, big, world changing, future thinking, awesome stuff.""The London Football Exchange has also started to explore other ways in which blockchain can help improve the current, antiquated systems that exist throughout the sport. When asked to think about football, many supporters and casual enthusiasts alike will be immediately transported to the uniquely tantalizing atmosphere of the stadium. This is the true heartland of many dedicated fans. However, getting there without a serious blow to the bank balance can be easier said than done.For the LFE’s token holders, however, paying extortionate prices through illegal resellers may soon become a thing of the past. Token holders will have access to tickets at a cheaper price and directly from the club itself.Football business expert Michael Broughton of the advising firm Sport Investment Partners spoke to the BBC about how this could also help clubs clamp down on misuse of season tickets:""At present, most sports venues do not know exactly who is coming into the stadium. At Premier League football clubs, it is not unknown for people to let friends use their season tickets when they cannot get to games.""The football clubs may know a ticket was used, but not always by whom. So they will never be able to target any further club marketing toward these spectators. You will have less fan engagement. Most clubs and stadiums have this issue.""If you put your ticketing system onto the blockchain, you can verify if people attended or who they gave their tickets to. If people want to transfer these tickets to friends or others, then it has to be recorded on the blockchain.""The appeal of this idea is not contained to British clubs alone. The Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) successfully trialed a mobile-based blockchain ticketing system, according to an Aug. 16 press release.The “successful implementation” of the ticketing system took place for a limited 50 percent share of tickets available for the 2018 UEFA Europa League final in May. The test ran smoothly, leading the UEFA to increase the second trial to include all available tickets for a match between the Spanish giants Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid, one of the football world’s most hotly anticipated fixtures. The UEFA is set to roll out more blockchain ticketing distribution in the near future."

It came across as a surprise for many that the progressive state, which is home to the world’s largest technology hub as well as to a politician whom Bloomberg calls the ‘Crypto Candidate for Congress,’ has suddenly set such a hard-handed regulatory precedent in the run-up to November’s elections.","If anything, the signals that emanated from the state’s Fair Political Practices Commission (FPPC) up to this point were largely positive: Just about a month ago, the commission considered the status of cryptocurrencies in state-level political campaigns. Although no definitive decision was reached at that time, commissioners were vocal about their reluctance to ban cryptocurrency from elections outright and expressed their willingness to do further research. How come the end result wound up so fiercely anti-crypto?The Fair Political Practices Commission (FPPC) is a regulatory body tasked with ensuring the integrity and fairness of state-level elections of public officials in the state of California. Its main responsibility is to administer and enforce the 1974 law called the Political Reform Act — a major piece of anti-corruption legislation enacted in the wake of the Watergate scandal. The ambition of its sponsors has been to eradicate corrupt practices in state government by limiting the amount of money spent in elections and eliminating contributions from anonymous donors. The Act endows the FPPC with the power to institute, interpret and amend particular regulations that will advance fundamental principles of this law.The FPPC is a five-person, non-partisan commission, meaning that no more than three members can represent one of the political parties. Its current chairperson is Alice Germond, who is a Democrat; so are Commissioners Frank Cardenas and Brian Hatch. One of the remaining seats is currently vacant, which leaves the fourth Commissioner, Allison Hayward, the only Republican on board.Thanks to the transparency of the FPPC’s records, the process leading to issuance of the commission’s opinions is usually traceable in granular detail. A closer look into the steps and decisions that the FPPC members had to take is insightful in its own right — but it is also instructive on a larger scale. Since campaign finance legislation shares a certain degree of similarity across the states — as often does the design of the regulatory bodies that oversee its enforcement — the Californian case might be indicative to some extent of the scope and character of the issues that state-level watchdogs face when grappling with regulation of crypto in elections.In the run-up to the Sept. 20 meeting, the FPPC issued a notice regarding the upcoming vote on the permissibility of cryptocurrencies for campaign contributions and expenditures. There are two main points of contention visible from the document. One applies to the question of whether cryptocurrencies should be treated the same as cash — and as such subject to same regulations — and another concern is the clause in the Political Reform Act that prescribes that a committee should only have one bank account in order to facilitate oversight.The potential solutions outlined in the document represented the whole range of regulatory approaches: a blanket ban on using crypto for campaign contributions and campaign expenditures; capping crypto contributions at the same level as cash donations (i.e., $100); requiring that cryptocurrency contributions be converted to fiat and deposited to a campaign’s single account; allowing committees to establish separate cryptocurrency accounts and make expenditures from them; classifying cryptocurrency contributions as in-kind and thus removing the cash cap. These, however, were just preliminary policy options that left the door open for any other language at the commission’s discretion.In response to the FPPC’s earlier call for conducting further research on cryptocurrencies before the final decision can be issued, at least two documents emerged in their sights prior to the Sept. 20 meeting. One was a product of the commission’s own staff’s research — a report put together by Acting General Counsel Brian Lau and Senior Counsel Zachary Norton. The document provides a description of cryptocurrencies’ structural features relevant to campaign finance law (with a nod to the classic traceability issues), clarifies their relation to the tenets of the Political Reform Act, sketches regulatory frameworks that exist in other states and on the federal level, and weighs potential policies listed in the FPPC notice against each other.Despite dedicating substantial space to Bitcoin traceability concerns, the FPPC staffers sound fairly positive in their evaluations of two ‘soft’ policy options. They note that regulating cryptocurrency contributions the same way as those made in cash will effectively do away with traceability concerns: Such donations will be limited to a modest $100 and required to be converted to fiat before being deposited to a campaign’s single account. Lau and Norton also suggest that if the same standard of mandatory conversion is applied, crypto contributions could also be treated as in-kind donations without the risk of jeopardizing the integrity of electoral processes.To be fair, they also mention that an outright ban would also solve traceability problems efficiently. The only policy option that staffers explicitly recommend against instituting is treating crypto donations as in-kind while permitting campaigns to maintain separate digital cash wallets. Overall, the report gives the impression of a balanced account and does not contain any language that could be interpreted as favoring a blanket ban.Another detailed perspective on the issue submitted to the Fair Political Practices Commission ahead of the vote came in the form of written comments from a nonprofit organization called the Campaign Legal Center. It also presents an overview of existing regulation in other jurisdictions and specifies the essential properties of digital money. The argument dwells heavily on the dangers of cryptocurrency transactions’ decentralized structure and pseudo-anonymity, which are not very compatible, the authors note, with the Political Reform Act’s spirit of maximum disclosure.Moreover, by allowing for an unlimited number of wallets per person, cryptocurrency systems “readily furnish a means for unscrupulous donors to funnel excess contributions through straw donor transactions.” And what sounds even more disturbing is that they “could provide a relatively simple method for foreign entities and other prohibited sources to direct money into California elections surreptitiously.”This vivid description of crypto threats to election integrity notwithstanding, the recommendation part of the Campaign Legal Center’s comments does not advance the idea of an outright ban. Rather, the nonprofit stands with the option that proposes to subject crypto contributions to the same regulations as those in cash — with a $100 cap per donor and a requirement to convert crypto to cash before depositing.On Sept. 20, four commissioners voted on the proposed regulation options, resulting in a 3-1 tally in favor of a blanket ban of cryptocurrencies from campaign finance, effective immediately. As the FPPC’s communications director Jay Wierenga explained to Breaker magazine, the main rationale for the decision has been transparency woes. Apparently, the majority concluded that the standards of openness and traceability that inform the Political Reform Act cannot be met with crypto contributions. It’s hard to tell why the vote went down this way despite the generally positive tone of the two major supporting analytical reports. Perhaps gory depictions of potential dangers permeating those narratives dwarfed reasonable — yet cautious — suggestions in favor of a more friendly approach. Or maybe the committee led by a 75-year-old politician, who is bound to step down in January 2019, simply decided to play it safe. At any rate, against the backdrop of opaque federal regulations and the impending election season, California has set a precedent that other states facing similar regulatory pressure might want to follow.Elsewhere in the country, regulation of political contributions made in cryptocurrencies remains scarce: only one in five states has any kind of ruling on the matter is in place. Here’s the roundup of the existing state-level regulations across the US.ColoradoIn July 2018, Colorado Secretary of State approved amendments to the Campaign and Political Finance Rules that first mentioned cryptocurrency contributions. Unchanged from the first version of the draft published in May, new regulation holds donations made in digital money to the same limit as regular cash donations. The USD value of crypto received is to be determined by the market value at the time of contribution, and campaigns are obliged to report all subsequent gains and losses as well.District of ColumbiaDC has had a few official words on cryptocurrency donations since late 2014, when its Board of Elections introduced new rules to Title 3 (Elections and Ethics) of the District of Columbia Municipal Regulations. The document mentions ‘Bitcoin contributions’ and specifies the order in which they have to be liquidated and reported as in-kind. The text implies that the cap is no different for crypto donations than any other kind.KansasIn October 2017, in response to a candidate’s request for guidance on whether they could accept bitcoin donations, Kansas Governmental Ethics Commission opined that digital currency was ‘too secretive’ to be used in campaign finance. It is unclear, however, if the scope of the ruling encompasses cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin.MassachusettsIn Massachusetts, the rules governing cryptocurrency donations to political committees are summarized in a January 2014 letter that the state’s Office of Campaign and Political Finance produced in response to Massachusetts Pirate Party PAC’s request of an opinion on the issue. The essence of the ruling is that ‘contributions in Bitcoins’ are permitted and subject to the same limits and disclosure requirements as fiat contributions, with a five-day period for liquidation. It is not allowed to directly use crypto for campaign expenditures, since state law holds it that any campaign purchase exceeding $50 should by paid for with a check from an official committee account.MontanaA similar pattern is visible in an advisory opinion issued by the Office of Montana Commissioner of Political Practices, also in January 2014. Receipt of crypto contributions is permitted, but expenditures can only be made out of a ‘primary campaign depository,’ hence there can be no such thing as the candidate’s official crypto wallet. The time period allowed for converting crypto to US dollars is tighter, though: committees should liquidate the contribution within 24 hours from receipt.North CarolinaIn August 2018, the North Carolina State Board of Elections Campaign Finance Office responded to a crypto-related inquiry by a candidate named Emmanuel Wilder with a firm ‘no,’ citing the regulator’s inability to adequately handle such contributions, as well as the fact that it is impossible to reliably ascribe value to crypto assets.OregonOregon took a more flexible stance, as Secretary of State Dennis Richardson came forward in June 2018 with a proposed set of rules designed to mirror the FEC’s approach of allowing contributions but not expenditures to be made in cryptocurrencies. Arguing that ‘cryptocurrency is here to stay,’ Richardson called the move ‘innovative way to expand participation in Oregon elections.’ In August 2018, the rule was adopted.South CarolinaIn South Carolina, the House Legislative Ethics Committee resorted to formal reasons when substantiating their decision to recommend against crypto campaign donations last April. According to the Committee, since the statutory definition of a contribution does not include anything like cryptocurrencies or digital assets, those cannot serve as a means of financing political campaigns.TennesseeTennessee law treats digital currency contributions the same as cash contributions, mandating that crypto is liquidated before it can be spent for campaign needs. The monetary value of crypto donations is determined by the market value at the time of receipt.WisconsinThe Wisconsin State Ethics Commission, when confronted with a request to resolve the issue of cryptocurrency’s status as a vehicle for political contributions in April this year, opted to pass it on to the state legislature. As of late September, the Wisconsin State Assembly hasn’t yet addressed the issue.Does the most recent California ban mean that Brian Forde is not getting any more donations in support of his congressional bid from fellow crypto entrepreneurs? Not at all. The Fair Political Practices Commission’s ruling only concerns the elections of California public officials and has nothing to do with the state’s candidates for national offices. Those running for the U.S. Congress and presidency should follow guidance of the Federal Election Commission (FEC), which has been anything but definitive so far.A 2014 FEC advisory opinion still stands as the only waymark for those seeking to comply with the law while soliciting donations made in cryptocurrency. It only mentions Bitcoin and treats it as an in-kind donation that should be deposited to the campaign’s main account before it can be spent. The document also deems contributions of up to $100 per donor permissible. However, since the advisory opinion is a response to a particular inquiry that only concerned contributions up to $100, it does not specifically address instances when the $100 cap is exceeded. Some candidates avidly exploit this legal grey zone to receive crypto donations worth up to $2,700 per donor.In the world where the US House Judiciary Committee chair discloses his ownership of a handsome chunk of digital wealth, a more comprehensive and up-to-date set of guidelines for crypto campaign finance is long overdue. The more candidates and voters are getting comfortable with digital money, the more common crypto donations become. There is already a registered 2020 presidential candidate who announced his embrace of Bitcoin as a means of supporting the campaign, and many more will certainly follow suit. Crypto-specific political action committees (PACs) are coming to fruition.It is very likely that serious legislative work in this area is already underway, and there is hope that national policymakers will adopt a more open-minded approach than did their Californian peers. Granted, anti-crypto fear-mongering is still widespread, as are some legitimate concerns and calls for watchful approach to sensitive legislation. However, there are also signs of countervailing narratives gradually gaining traction among policymakers, which suggests that blanket bans will eventually give way to more nuanced and sensible regulatory architectures."

The kimchi premium is reportedly mainly seen in terms of Bitcoin (BTC) price.Kim Dong-sup, the official behind the bank’s payment systems research team, has claimed that the “kimchi premium” is an “indicator of the overheated domestic market.”South Korea is reportedly the world’s largest crypto user base, ranked third after the U.S. and Japan, having faced a whole crypto frenzy of altcoins that previously traded over 30 percent above the rest of the markets. Cryptocurrency price tracker CoinMarketCap removed South Korean exchanges from its index in January, citing an “extreme divergence in prices” from the rest of the world.For example, during the period from July 2017 to May 2018, cryptocurrencies in South Korea cost 5 percent more than they did internationally. The “kimchi premium” rate peaked in January at 48.29 percent, while crypto prices at foreign exchanges denominated in major worldwide currencies such as the U.S. dollar and the euro had no real price differences.Since then, Bloomberg reported in February that the “kimchi premium” has all but disappeared.Speaking about the consequences of another “kimchi premium,” the official urged the country’s authorities to continue to monitor the market, as well as to raise public awareness of crypto in order to prevent investors from turning their life savings to crypto “on a false hope of a price increase.”According to the BoK’s report, a high “kimchi premium” level can cause other side effects on the country’s market, such as an infusion of illegal foreign exchanges transaction.In December 2017, the Korean authorities barred the public from anonymous crypto trading, while now a revocation of their Initial Coin Offering (ICO) ban is reportedly being considered.Recently, South Korea’s Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) has suggested a need for greater international cooperation between regulators for crypto and ICO regulation, stressing that the country's main challenge is to ""improve transparency in transactions to prevent illegal activities."""

The accusations were based on the multi-level referral system and promise of astronomical returns on customers’ investments.The U.S. states of Illinois and Arizona are asking the CID to seize the property of the promoters, who are suspected of raising Rs 41,000 crore (around $5.6 billion) from investors. Most of the funds were purportedly poured into the firm after the demonetization of high-value banknotes at the direction of the Modi government in 2016.The CID claims that “those who invested in this virtual currency company after demonetization are suspected of laundering black money.” The agency added that it will request the probe of such investors by the enforcement directorate and income tax  authorities.Initially, the fraud scheme was reported by businessman Shailesh Bhatt, who claimed that he had been kidnapped and robbed of Rs 9 crore ($1.2 million) worth of BTC by local police. The CID said:“The investigation found that Bhatt had invested Rs 2 crore ($275,000) in BitConnect and after the company shut shop in January 2017, he kidnapped an employee of BitConnect, Dhaval Mavani, and extorted Bitcoins, Litecoins and cash worth Rs 155 crore ($25 million) from him.”At the end of August, Indian police arrested Divyesh Darji for allegedly promoting BitConnect and scamming investors. Darji, a resident of Surat city, reportedly said that he had been the India head of BitConnect. The CID claims that staff at the BitCoinnect office in Surat admitted that promoters had overall amassed “crores [tens of millions] of rupees from thousands of investors.”Following the cessation of BitConnect’s activities, a number of users in the U.S. launched a class action lawsuit against the company, seeking compensation for lost funds, reportedly amounting to $771,000. The suite alleges that the BitConnect tokens were unregistered securities in a “wide-ranging Ponzi scheme.”"

Reddit in May 2017, just before his election as president. This is ...","Sep 25, 2018","Today, the Assemblée Nationale (the French parliament’s lower house) is initiating a debate about a legal project introduced last June by the Minister of Economy and Finance, Bruno Le Maire, which contains some relevant changes for the French regulatory framework with regard to crypto assets and ICOs, together with many proposals aimed at sustaining the development of “liberated companies that are better funded, more innovative and fairer.”","This innovation, stimulated by the Plan d'Action pour la Croissance et la Transformation des Entreprises (PACTE – Action Plan for Business Growth and Transformation) would be an important step drawing France closer to the digital revolution revolving around blockchain and overcoming  the gap which presently separates France from the small club of countries that have created a favorable environment for investment in fintech and blockchain industry.In fact, France was never an early-starter in this field: For instance, the projects financed by ICOs promoted by companies based in France currently make up only a fraction of the ones which chose to set their headquarters in Switzerland or in tiny countries such as Singapore or Gibraltar (this last one is an Overseas Territory of the United Kingdom).Article 26 of the new legal scheme, if approved by parliament, will modify the Financial and Monetary Code, introducing a definition for entities such as tokens (described in the law as “immaterial items, representing in digital form one or more rights, which could be issued, compiled, kept and transferred through a digital shared instrument, allowing to identify — directly or indirectly — its owner”) and ICO (“a public offer for tokens subscription, in whatever form”).Besides, the modified code will offer to the émetteurs de jetons (literally, the tokens’ issuing entities — it’s very likely that the French administration will prefer this label rather than ICOs) the possibility of requiring a sort of ‘visa’ issued by the Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF, Financial Market Authority, the French regulator), certifying a set of requirements concerning transparency and diligence with regard to investors.To obtain the AMF’s ‘license’ — which is, by the way, a voluntary process, not a legal requirement — a company proposing an ICO should produce a promotional document (aka a white paper) presenting contents that are “exact, clear, not misleading, which allow to understand the risks involved in the offer.” Besides checking the presale communication, the AMF would monitor the means which are to be implemented to guarantee the security and the transparency of the token issuing event and would monitor information about the results of the ICO and the creation of a secondary market for the tokens. The French press already disclosed some rumors about an amendment proposed by three MPs to extend the certification system to all the business activities dealing with crypto digital assets (“actifs numériques”) — i.e., exchanges, consultancies and intermediaries.Even with some flaws (see below), the new scheme would create a milestone for France and perhaps even for Europe. However, this revolution didn’t come overnight.A picture of Emmanuel Macron holding a Bitcoin hard wallet was released on Reddit in May 2017, just before his election as president. This is probably not proof that Macron could be considered as a crypto-enthusiast — as some might try to read into it. However, it is true that the 39-year old politician, a former telecoms executive, supported IT innovation as a tool to reform French administration and to boost the national economy since his first days in the Élysée Palace.In fact, the scheme proposed under the PACTE isn’t an isolated measure. Rather, it is one of the first tangible results of a debate, which engaged the recently-appointed government for almost this whole year. It could be meaningful to note that some of the first cautious moves toward a “French digital revolution” coincided with the troubled rally of the crypto market at the end of 2017 and the beginning of 2018.From October to December 2017, for instance, the AMF promoted a research program (UNICORN) based on a public consultation with regard to ICOs, which involved 82 respondents — including digital business players, academics, institutional investors, financial professionals, bank representatives and so on. The aim was to achieve a better definition of ICOs and tokens (such as that provided by the Swiss FINMA between April 2017 and February 2018), in order to issue guidelines on ICOs without changing the existing regulations and, in the meantime, exploring potential future regulatory actions.Besides the formal results, it’s relevant to notice the positive attitude the monetary authority demonstrated toward the industry.Even before the release of the UNICORN report, however, the Financial and Monetary Code encompassed some new articles, paving the way for a first acceptance of blockchain into French legislation. With a decree issued on Dec. 8, 2017, the French government introduced some changes which recognized the transfer of financial values via “a shared digital registration instrument” on the same level as traditional account-to-account registration.A new government-sponsored think tank was promoted by Le Marie on Jan. 15, 2018, with the task of proposing “orientations for the evolution of current regulation,” with the main goal of “better controlling the development of cryptocurrencies and preventing use of them for the purposes of tax avoidance, money-laundering or the financing of criminal or terrorist activities.” Appointed to lead the group as ‘Monsieur Bitcoin’ — as the French press has labelled him — was Jean-Pierre Landau, senior officer in many international financial bodies, former deputy governor of the Banque de France and affiliated professor at Sciences Po, the same political sciences Grande École which Le Marie — and the majority of the top ranks in the French administration — attended.  In spite of some concern about the French government’s orientation which arose as a consequence of Landau’s appointment — who is also known for some critical stances against Bitcoin-mania — during the Buenos Aires G20 in March 2018, the Minister of Economy and Finance was very direct in terms of calming the need for France to join the crypto revolution.The first concrete move was the definition of a new, simplified fiscal framework for the financial gains achieved by non-professional investors trading in cryptocurrencies. The General Directorate of Public Finances (the French tax authority) issued rules about cryptocurrencies back in 2014, classifying the personal gains from the sale of crypto assets and from mining as being among “non-recurring gains from a non-professional activity,” a category subject to a progressive income tax ranging between 14 percent and 45 percent. Last April’s decision of the Conseil d’État updated and clarified the fiscal rules, submitting the gains of trading to a flat rate of taxation (19 percent), including the sale of Bitcoin (oddly, the only cryptocurrency the document references) into “the category of capital gains of movable property” —  no change for mining and for the outcome of professional activities, the latter being taxed as industrial and commercial profits.Therefore, the presentation of the PACTE’s scheme on ICOs on June 19, crowned months of debate and the rising commitment of the French administration with regard to the topic.So, is France ready to lead Europe toward the new paradigm of the blockchain economy, effectively competing against the Crypto Valley (Switzerland), the Crypto Island (Malta) and the Crypto Harbor (Gibraltar)? As a matter of fact, Le Marie’s proposals are far from becoming law, as the French legislative process requires that both Houses (the National Assembly and the Senate) review and approve an identical version of the texts submitted by the government.In addition, the proposed ICO regulations establish some essential premises, while leaving other points rather blurred: The criteria underlying the AMF visas need to be defined in the future, alongside with the profiles and competences of the officers in charge of checking them. Besides, all the processes incorporated in the PACTE plan are based on voluntary agreement, and no sanctions —  save the loss of the visa — are envisaged for the ICOs which do not comply with the information provided in their ‘certified’ white paper. Finally, France would need to cope with EU monetary and financial watchdogs that, until now, haven’t shown a particularly favorable orientation toward the blockchain ecosystem and, especially, toward ICOs.Nevertheless, the new French attitude features many notable elements. First of all, the subject aims to update the regulatory framework of one of the largest European countries — one that is provided with large population, a rich market, a strong administrative tradition, a number of research and education institutions that are renowned throughout the world and a lively business community. Even if France could be presently considered ‘crypto-underdeveloped,’ if compared to many small and even tiny crypto-havens, the country is likely to have the strength to fill the gap and to demonstrate the potential of the mass adoption of blockchain-based innovation in a complex social and economic environment.  Besides, it is interesting to note that the French decision makers are approaching the challenge of the crypto revolution in a rather original way: France, for instance, has tackled some of the technological paradigm shifts of the past decades — nuclear energy, petrochemicals, information and communications technology (ICT) — stressing elements such as centralization and strong regulatory schemes. The AMF-supported debate among a wide range of operators, non-restrictive regulation and voluntary action are some promising novelties.Maybe, the late start itself will have some positive influences, stimulating an approach that is somehow able to cope with the very nature of the blockchain (i.e., decentralization and transparency).Back in the late 1980s, France was at the forefront of ICT innovation as the first country to experience the mass adoption of digital network technology thanks to Minitel, a text-only internet-like oddity (looking at it from today’s perspective), promoted by France Telecom. The French-Wide-Web operated from 1982 to 2012 and French people could enjoy online access to phone directories, bank accounts, flight bookings, libraries — and, needless to say, some adult content — before the average American, Briton or German. Then, Minitel — heavily dependent on government support and based on proprietary technology — found itself unable to deal with the competition of the ‘globally open’ internet and began its retreat in the mid-‘90s.Perhaps starting the race for the crypto revolution far from a lead position will allow France to achieve a better observation point, helping the decision makers to avoid the temptations of technological grandeur and stimulating them to match the regulations with the characteristics of the needs of the blockchain."

investigating over 800 soft forks and hard forks from Bitcoin (BTC).","Sep 14, 2018","A new study suggests that the stability of digital currencies is threatened by software updates, known as “hard forks,”according to a September 12 press release. The study states that clear guidelines on software updates could help stabilize cryptocurrencies.","The paper was prepared by a group of researchers, led by the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education fellow Benjamin Trump, who reviewed the state of cryptocurrency “forks” by investigating over 800 soft forks and hard forks from Bitcoin (BTC).While the study says that digital currencies have the potential to significantly change commerce and information exchange on a global scale owing to the underlying blockchain technology, Trump argues that governance challenges threaten the stability of crypto. “Disruption of a cryptocurrency's blockchain in this way might cause people to lose trust in it and its capacity to survive as a reliable vehicle of exchange,” Trump continues.The analysis reportedly found that a fair amount of BTC forks and altcoins did not survive more than several months, though some of them have entrenched themselves and lasted for years. Per the researchers, hard forks will become more regular, with up to 50 possible in 2018 alone. Trump explained:""Hard forks are a threat to maintaining a stable and predictable operating platform that is essential if cryptocurrencies are to be adopted for daily financial transactions.""Regarding a possible future of BTC as a recognized medium of exchange on an international level, Trump argued that operators within the BTC network, such as crypto miners, wallet developers, exchanges and others, will need to develop better governance to provide stability.Another study conducted by Initial Coin Offering (ICO) advisory firm Satis Group at the end of August, suggests that the BTC price could potentially reach $98,000 in the next five years. Per the report, the value of cryptoassets needed to support the economy will increase from approximately $500 billion next year to $3.6 trillion by 2028, while 90 percent of cryptoasset value will be extracted from penetration of offshore deposits in the next ten years."

The company’s share price subsequently fell 12 percent.In an open letter to investors, which Byrne reportedly signed ""your humble servant,"" he pointed out several reasons for shareholders not to be concerned about his decision, saying “don't worry, I'm still in the game, and we're going to bring this House to its knees.""

Washington built this.” The CEO continued:“I needed to sell stock during this quarter to meet such other obligations. I am disappointed that I when the deadline arrived for my sales this quarter, the stock had dropped (I sadly note that over the last 180 days the correlation between OSTK's and Bitcoin's daily movements has been 85.5%, and again warn people: we don't have significant holdings of Bitcoin).”Byrne also asserted that, over the course of 18 years at Overstock, he has “only ever sold a tiny sliver” of his stake and for most of those years he did not draw a salary. Byrne noted that for the last several months he drew “$100,000 so as to avoid being one of those schmucks who does not draw a salary.”As an early advocate advocate for Bitcoin and blockchain technology, Byrne is apparently regarded as a pioneer of crypto in business.

During the fraud case against Brooklyn resident Maksim Zaslavskiy — who allegedly defrauded investors by promoting two cryptocurrencies reportedly backed by real estate and diamonds — U.S. District Judge Raymond Dearie ruled that federal securities laws could apply to the case. In Dearie’s words, federal securities laws should be interpreted “flexibly,” thus dismissing a motion from Zaslavskiy’s lawyers to drop the charges on the grounds that the cryptocurrencies didn’t fall under the Securities Exchange Act.Vitalik Buterin Believes Crypto, Blockchain Space Has Seen The End Of “1000x” GrowthAccording to recent comments from Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, the growth and innovation of the crypto and blockchain spaces are reaching their plateau and will not see “1,000-times growth” again.

In Eichengreen’s opinion, stablecoins, including Tether, are not automatically “viable” just because they are pegged to reserves of, for example, fiat currency.

Once people are invested, they want everyone else to join the party. There’s been this huge, almost a community movement around this.”To address the surge in demand for crypto, major conglomerates started to get heavily involved in the local market since December of last year, which continued throughout 2018.As of September 2018, every major multi-billion dollar company in South Korea remains actively involved in the cryptocurrency sector.L​GLG, the second-largest electronics manufacturer behind Samsung, has been developing a cryptocurrency trading platform, a blockchain-based, cross-border payment system, and Internet of Things (IoT)-focused blockchain network.Over the past two years, LG has focused on building IoT-enabled electronics — like air conditioning systems, vacuum cleaners and refrigerators — that can be controlled by a cloud-based system. The priority of LG has been to create smart homes that allow anyone to control any appliance within the house with an app.In the long term, through the deployment of its own unique blockchain system, LG is aiming to base INFioT, the firm’s IoT platform, and smart factory platform Factova on top of the blockchain.To achieve this, the blockchain network integrated by LG’s IoT and smart factory platforms will need a level of scalability that is at least ten-thousandfold higher than existing public blockchain networks. As the transaction capacity of blockchain networks generally improve, it will be possible for LG and other conglomerates to deploy large-scale apps on peer-to-peer (p2p) networks.SamsungSamsung — the biggest conglomerate in South Korea that has dominance over the insurance, real estate, electronics and payment sector — has been allocating most of the resources of its crypto and blockchain department in maintaining its cryptocurrency ASIC miner manufacturing foundry.The electronics giant initially entered the cryptocurrency mining market back in January of this year, with the strategy of mass producing ASIC miners by leveraging its existing foundry in Suwon, South Korea. Hwang Min-seong, an analyst at Samsung Securities, said:“Samsung Electronics could increase its revenues through ASIC chip manufacturing, but because the foundry only accounts for a small portion of the company’s semiconductor manufacturing plant, it is difficult to predict that the firm’s mining venture will have a significant impact on the company’s revenues.”KakaoKakao, the most influential internet conglomerate in the country that operates five main apps — KakaoPay, KakaoTaxi, KakaoStock, KakaoTalk and KakaoStory, that have nearly 90 percent market share over the fintech, ride-hailing, online stock brokerage, messaging and social media markets — has assisted Dunamu in launching and running Upbit, the country’s largest crypto exchange.HyundaiHyundai, the leading automobile manufacturer of South Korea, has been operating a blockchain platform called HDAC through its subsidiary Hyundai BS&C.SImilar to LG, since early 2017, Hyundai has been exploring ways to utilize the blockchain in fueling applications that can be applied to smart factories, smart homes, smart buildings and various industries. As the the HDAC development team explained:“Also, M2M [machine-to-machine] transaction for mutual contracts and operation between IoT devices are implemented to bring a platform where rational consumptions and transactions are possible. It is also where we can implement Transaction Innovation.”Hyundai BS&C has also been operating a mining pool, but in May, local publications reported that the mining pool of HDAC was hacked, leading to the loss of the miners’ funds.SK and Shinhan BankSK and Shinhan Bank, the country’s largest telecommunications and financial institutions, have financed cryptocurrency exchanges to establish a better infrastructure to protect investors and facilitate capital moving from the traditional finance sector to crypto.Apart from Bithumb, all of the major cryptocurrency exchanges in South Korea are either financed or developed by leading conglomerates. Interestingly, Bithumb remains the only major cryptocurrency exchange to be hacked in South Korea.Upbit is operated by Kakao/Dunamu, Korbit is backed by SK and Softbank Korea, Gopax is financed by Shinhan Bank (the second-largest commercial bank in the country), and Coinone is financed by SBI Holdings, which invested in Coinone by purchasing equity in Dayli Financial Group.Gopax, Upbit, Coinone and Korbit have not experienced any successful security breach or hacking attempt, which is important to note as all of these companies represent the reputation and track record of entities that are significantly larger than their operations.Companies like SK, Kakao, Shinhan Bank and SBI Holdings that are valued at well over $10 billion would rather allocate a larger amount of revenues coming from the exchanges to prioritize security and compliance than maximize profits. These conglomerates, as for now, are not in the sector for short-term profits.Unlike startups, major conglomerates in South Korea are active in the cryptocurrency sector because they plan to remain at the forefront of cryptocurrency and blockchain development as a long-term strategy.Moreover, conglomerates are incentivized to run crypto exchanges and blockchain initiatives because the government of South Korea has recognized digital asset trading platforms as regulated financial institutions and established blockchain technology as one of the three pillars of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, alongside big data and artificial intelligence (AI).The decision of Dunamu — which operates KakaoStock as a subsidiary of Kakao — to recently expand Upbit to Singapore and launch a fiat-to-crypto exchange in the region demonstrates the intent of the company to increase awareness of its brand.The company’s CEO, Lee Sir-goo, stated that in the upcoming years, it will continue to build a bridge between the local crypto market of South Korea and the global market.“One of the key functions of a crypto-asset exchange is to connect the real economy to cryptocurrencies, and we believe we can provide this bridge between Korea and the global market. We hope the blockchain regulatory guidelines will be established soon in Korea so that companies here can continue to grow their competitiveness.”Investors in the local market are expected to continue remain highly optimistic by the involvement of Shinhan Bank in the sector, as it guarantees stable banking services in the local cryptocurrency market. There exists no risk of banks refusing to provide financial services to exchanges because the second-largest financial institution in the market operates an exchange.The unique structure of the local crypto exchange market in South Korea and the acknowledgement of the crypto exchange market as a legitimate industry led more investors to enter the market, which is evident based on the volume of the local cryptocurrency market.Image source: CoinMarketCapThis week, the volume of Upbit and Bithumb increased by 345 percent and 134 percent respectively, as the crypto market added $20 billion to its valuation.The most recent partnership established between a local conglomerate and a blockchain project in South Korea is the collaboration of ICON and SK Planet in utilizing the blockchain to power the country’s most widely utilized mileage system.In July, SK disclosed its plans to use cryptocurrencies to compensate and incentivize users of OK Cashbag, which supports 35 million members in its mileage and membership system, which is more than 50 percent of the entire population of South Korea, estimated to be 51.25 million.An SK Planet spokesperson told local mainstream outlet Hani:“OK CashBag has approved the initiation of OKX Project, a blockchain technology-based project, and is currently in a phase of reviewing various business models and incentivization methods. But, SKPlanet will not engage in any ICO or fundraising pertaining to OKX Project.”On Sept. 20, ICON, the most valuable blockchain project in the country, signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with SK Planet to link the ICON blockchain network with OK Cashbag and develop mid- and long-term strategies to commercialize the blockchain in the country.Park JM, an executive at SK Planet, said:“Blockchain appears to be one of the key technologies that will promote market transformation in existing industry for the medium and long term. SK Planet will work with ICON to derive synergies in various fields so that we can offer differentiated benefits to our customers.”With its involvement in Korbit, SK remains one of the most active conglomerates in the local cryptocurrency and blockchain sector.Earlier this year, ICON also partnered with Kyobo, a leading insurance service provider alongside Samsung, to utilize blockchain technology in processing and automating the complex insurance claiming process.Kim Jong-hyup, Foundation Council Member at ICON Foundation and the CEO of ICONLOOP told Cointelegraph:“With more hospitals and insurance providers on board, ICONLOOP will go through a pilot test by September 2018 and launch a formal operation starting October.”The reputation of ICON in South Korea comes from its partnership with the government in bringing talent to the blockchain sector by training university graduates and inexperienced individuals to develop expertise in blockchain development.As Cointelegraph reported in July, the government of South Korea introduced its first cryptocurrency and blockchain legislation in history, after refusing to regulate the market. For many years, government were skeptical towards establishing regulatory frameworks because it believed that it will legitimize the cryptocurrency sector.Consecutive hacking attacks experienced by Bithumb, Coinrail, and many other cryptocurrency exchanges ultimately forced the government to draft a legislation around crypto and blockchain to protect investors.Shortly after releasing the first draft of the crypto legislation, the government recognized the blockchain as one of three main technologies in the fourth industrial revolution, promoting the training of blockchain.Won Young-kyung , a software policy officer at the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Energy, said:“Although the youth employment issue is emerging as a social problem, the problem of job mismatch is serious.”But, despite the optimistic approach of the government toward regulating the space, in September, South Korea’s venture enterprise division decided to remove crypto exchanges from the newly drafted venture acceleration bill.The venture acceleration bill, which provides small to medium-sized companies a wide range of benefits — including tax reduction — eliminated cryptocurrency exchanges alongside casinos and alcohol distributors, placing crypto-related business in the same category as organizations that handle gambling.The questionable decision of the venture enterprise division led investors and companies in the crypto sector to outrage. Experts in the cryptocurrency market have stated that if the bill is passed in its current form without crypto-related businesses, it will negatively impact the economy of South Korea, as it will drive away investors from local exchanges and prevent venture capital firms from supporting the country’s crypto exchanges.While the decision of the venture enterprise division of South Korea remains to be seen, overall, the cryptocurrency industry of South Korea is thriving with the involvement of multi-billion dollar conglomerates and banks.Crypto-related businesses and blockchain projects are receiving both financial support and resources from local corporations that are able to build sufficient infrastructure to meet growing demand from retail traders and institutional investors.As regulatory frameworks around cryptocurrency exchanges and blockchain projects improve, with companies like SK, Samsung, LG, Hyundai and Kyobo involved, the crypto market of South Korea could be expected to grow at an exponential rate."

The agency notes that the updated list is not comprehensive, and has been assembled largely as the result of victims’ reports, adding a request for any information about crypto-related scams in Belgium.The Bitcoin Boom Reaches a Canadian Ghost TownWhat happens when a remote British Columbian town that lost its paper mill — for all intents and purposes turning into a ghost town with a population of less than 100 — accepts the offer of an out-of-towner to come in and use their excess hydroelectric power to mine for Bitcoin? The answer? Not that much, currently, as Bitcoin mining facilities don’t bring in a large workforce, and the price of Bitcoin is lower than the mining facility was planned for.Bitcoin’s Path to Method of PaymentBitcoin developer Jimmy Song explains the multiple reasons that people want to use Bitcoin (which seems to be mainly as a store of value rather than a method of payment, according to Song), and what the evolution of Bitcoin may look like in the future (i.e. how can one make merchants want to keep Bitcoin a store of value?)."

cryptocurrency ...","Sep 11, 2018","Cryptocurrency caught mainstream attention when the industry’s total market cap hit $600 billion at the end of last year. The highly anticipated cannabis industry in the United States is similarly being pushed into the spotlight by a “green rush” of investors flooding Wall Street, who expect the industry to be worth $75 billion by 2030.","Aside from attracting high volumes of bold new investors, the cannabis and cryptocurrency industries in the U.S. also share some major issues: Both are high-risk, legally uncertain and have government regulators breathing down their neck. The potential uses of cryptocurrency and blockchain align with the demands of the developing cannabis market, and through a coordinated effort, the unexpected pair can propel themselves to legitimacy in the dynamic modern economy.Cannabis businesses in the U.S. operate on a cash-only basis because banks, which all operate under federal regulation, are prohibited to service an industry that is still deemed illegal under federal law. Cannabis dispensaries can hold up to $100,000 in cash at any given time, and if a business's finances are not carefully reported to state regulators, their cash is extremely vulnerable to seizure by police using broad asset-forfeiture laws.On the flipside, state treasuries don’t collect their fair share of taxes on marijuana sales. The inconvenient and unsecure tax collection processes, whereby dispensary owners may have to cross the state with armed guards to deliver hundred of thousands of dollars in cash to the state's IRS offices, leads many businesses to cut corners while reporting sales.PotCoin, one of the most popular cannabis cryptocurrencies, was first created in 2014 to address the financial limits placed on cannabis dispensaries. PotCoin targeted the Colorado recreational marijuana market and installed a PotCoin ATM at a dispensary in the state, but failed to be integrated into dispensaries early on in its tenure. In a turn of events, the currency’s value shot up 76 percent in just one day, after famed NBA star Dennis Rodman wore a PotCoin.com t-shirt while traveling to North Korea under intense media spotlight. It’s current market cap hovers around $10 million at press time.Although PotCoin struggles to establish itself as a mainstay in the industry, it announced a promotional agreement with WeedMD last December in what appears to be the first-ever partnership between a cryptocurrency and a federally licensed producer and distributor of medical cannabis. Community members eligible to shop on WeedMD will be rewarded for using PotCoin. The announcement was made in anticipation of the legalization of recreational pot in Canada this summer.As part of a global initiative for mass adoption, Potcoin worked with development teams at PotWallet and General Bytes PotCoin to offer their currency in over 800 crypto ATMs around the world in order to make funds more readily available for customers and to ease the transaction process for cannabis vendors.Similar to PotCoin, CannabisCoin is described as a marijuana-based cryptocurrency for medical marijuana point-of-sale. The developers created a ‘CAANdy system,’ whereby one gram of marijuana costs 1 CANN. The creators of CannabisCoin sought to create a simplified and accountable system for dispensaries to record medical sales in order to comply with strict regulations in the U.S. that ensure medical marijuana doesn’t end up in the wrong hands.HempCoin is also among one of the first 30 cryptocurrencies created in 2014, but focuses on the exchange between marijuana farmers and dispensaries. The coin first addressed the need of financial infrastructure for cannabis farmers but has broadened its mission to service the agricultural industry more generally.  In August, HempCoin announced a partnership with Evolution Host, a VPS hosting provider, which will accept HempCoin as payment in an effort to promote widespread adoption of its use. Likewise, HempCoin is accepted on Stembis.com, a major Canadian online cannabis marketplace.Marijuana altcoins have seen some success; however, most are struggling to find mainstream acceptance and have failed to provide a big return to investors. The most popular coins PotCoin and HempCoin, both stand at market caps below the  $10 million mark, numbers that can hardly be called impressive.Another major issue facing pot businesses are the high costs of opening a cannabis dispensary, which are much higher than those of a typical small business. The sum total of licensing and permit fees, finding pot-friendly retail space, investing in POS and security systems, and having enough capital to demonstrate business viability can all cost between $250,000 and $750,000.Small businesses in the cannabis sector can take advantage of a provision in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act that expands entrepreneurs’ access to capital by allowing them to engage in crowdfunding initiatives like ICOs. Title IV, or Regulation A+, allows private businesses to raise up to $50 million from public investors, which is particularly beneficial for small dispensaries aiming to tap into a larger pool of online investors.High Times Holding Corp. first announced it would accept Bitcoin and Ethereum in its IPO in August, making it the first ever traditional stock offering to accept cryptocurrency investments by taking advantage of Regulation A+. However, the company apparently backtracked on its promise to accept BTC and ETH in its IPO just two weeks later when it filed regulatory paperwork with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) excluding the cryptocurrencies.Despite the confusion, Bitcoin remains as a payment option on the company’s investment portal. A representative from High Times clarified that a third-party will convert Bitcoin to fiat currency for the company to avoid holding any investments as cryptocurrency and any controversy with the SEC. The CEO of the marijuana media organization, Adam Levin, said while he “didn’t believe that the ICO process was the right move for [the] brand, it would’ve been foolish to leave this emerging investor base out.”Advertising cannabis businesses and products is prohibited in many instances due to stringent federal regulations. Major platforms like Google and Facebook are unlikely to change their policies against advertising legal and recreational drug use until marijuana is cleared at the federal level, which isn’t expected under the anti-pot Trump administration.Despite 29 states having already legalized medical marijuana, there are few educational resources or services that provide information about the benefits and potential side effects of particular marijuana strains. The history of production or origin of strains for sale is even less clear to consumers.A Canadian, blockchain-based ‘social marijuana network’ CannaSOS, is addressing many of the shortcomings of the newly legalized cannabis industry in the country. CannaSOS integrates blockchain tech into its platform to connect buyers, sellers and advertisers in a transparent and accountable network. CannaSOS provides a centralized online meeting place for cannabis enthusiasts to engage with other users, find and share cannabis-related information, search and review particular strains, and locate 420-friendly businesses. The site rewards user participation with Perk$coins that can be converted to fiat currency or exchanged for goods and services offered by businesses within the CannaSOS network.The Cannabis Hemp Exchange, or CHEX, is a similar service that provides a platform to cannabis cultivators, manufacturers, intermediaries and product brands to use for marketing, order management and distribution. CHEX is described as a service for the wholesale exchange of cannabis commodity in B2B transactions, or for business-to-business customers.The blockchain firm Paragon is addressing the demand for more transparency and standardization in cannabis supply chains by creating a crypto token built on smart contracts to systematize the traditionally fragmented cannabis industry. The company’s digital token, ParagonCoin, allows users to directly participate on the Paragon platform and, like others of its kind, offers a banking alternative to cannabis businesses. Paragon’s ICO, which took place last year, raised $70 million but was hit with claims the ParagonCoin was overvalued.In tandem, Paragon’s open-source blockchain, Parachain, ensures immutability and easy access to data concerning final cannabis products. Paragon’s ‘seed-to-sale’ solution means businesses won’t have to question the source of the final product sold to customers. Each stage in the supply chain is recorded by responsible parties - like growers, manufacturers, logistics, and scientists testing the product in labs - and launched as a smart contract.Additionally, Paragon's business model accounts for the need for physical workspaces for cannabis businesses and entrepreneurs and offers co-workspace locations that members can pay for exclusively with cryptocurrency - one of the first all-crypto real estate offerings. Paragon’s CEO, Jessica VerSteeg, says the workspace is near full capacity with 80 tenants, and that Paragon has partnered with various cannabis aficionados like Dank City, Aurora Elixirs, Green Helix and the podcast Casually Baked.Logistics and supply chain management are the strongest cases for blockchain adoption. The efforts to add transparency and accountability to the supply chain management of cannabis businesses yields positive effects to the social stigma surrounding marijuana use. Medical marijuana dispensaries are successfully rebranding the drug by providing detailed information about the medicinal properties of particular strains, but communities moving to legalize pot still see pushback over concern that the legal cannabis will inevitably fall into the wrong hands.Blockchain solutions like Paragon’s ‘seed-to-sale,’ CannaSOS’s ‘social marijuana network,’ or dispensaries using cryptocurrencies as a secure and accountable mechanism for sale are the key to ensuring accountability in the pot industry and to facilitating a positive ecosystem for buyers and sellers.The growing cannabis industry in the U.S. has proved its profitability (national marijuana sales in the U.S. are estimated to hit $11 billion this year), but in terms of commoditization, pot still faces many hurdles."

The need to keep critical data safe and provably unaltered is even more pronounced in areas such as law enforcement and defense, where the consequences of failing to protect data might be especially dreadful.

Around the same time, The US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the very organization that we should thank for creating the internet, announced that it was accepting bids from contractors who would ‘create a secure messaging and transaction platform that separates the message creation, from the transfer (transport) and reception of the message using a decentralized messaging backbone to allow anyone anywhere the ability to send a secure message or conduct other transactions across multiple channels traceable in a decentralized ledger.’ In May 2017, the agency awarded a grant to a firm that subscribed to create this DLT-based messaging system.Across the Atlantic, the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory, part of the UK Ministry of Defence, has been working with a domestic consultancy firm on a project aimed at improving integrity of data produced by networked sensors. Reuters also reported in late 2017 that the British justice ministry considered implementing a blockchain-powered solution to keep evidence tamper-proof.  Australia's financial intelligence agency and the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission pooled some resources last year to fund the effort by HoustonKemp, a Singapore-based contractor, to build a blockchain system advancing the same goal – securely recording, storing, and sharing sensitive intelligence and evidence created by investigations.Russia, too, has been wasting no time, as its Ministry of Defense designated a newly built research laboratory to explore the potential applications of blockchain technology for safeguarding critical military infrastructure from cyber attacks.Tech corporations that are into the business of building blockchain applications do not just stand on the sidelines waiting for governmental agencies’ bid issuances. A few days ago, news broke that IBM registered a patent for a network security solution that relies on a distributed network of monitors to track breaches in systems’ defenses. This design will be especially effective against sophisticated attacks that cover up their own tracks. Even if one monitor is hacked, others will spot irregularities in system logs as they diverge from a previously blockchain-recorded consensus.Another product specifically aimed at law enforcement and related organizations, called the Blockchain Evidence Locker, hit the market in September. A creation from Canadian firm Leonovus, the product is designed to maintain a detailed, cryptographically secured chain of custody record for the growing body of digital evidence that security agencies store. Overall, it won’t be surprising if within a decade maintaining a distributed and encrypted database of evidence will become a standard for law enforcement in the developed world.Another common and well-documented application of blockchain technology for security and law enforcement purposes manifests in a wide range of tools that permit tracking suspicious or illegal financial activity, with the ultimate goal of matching pseudonymous crypto addresses with perpetrators of real crime. In this domain, police and intelligence agencies often operate in collaboration with private companies that build and maintain relevant software tools, or even completely outsource investigative work to them.One of the notable features of this sector is a ‘blockchain detective’ firm Chainalysis, whose software has been instrumental in multiple investigations led by the US Department of Justice and other prominent agencies. Chainalysis has recently raised millions of dollars to expand its operations from a single Bitcoin blockchain that it previously scrutinized to a much wider array of cryptocurrencies.London-based Elliptic, which often secures a mention next to Chainalysis as its closest competitor, has created tools that allow crypto exchanges or other interested parties to red-flag transactions that raise suspicions of being linked to illicit activities. Elliptic’s solutions are specifically focused on stopping criminals at the choke point where they attempt to cash out the shady money.This year also saw San Francisco-based Bitfury group, an entity that started as bitcoin miner but moved on to become a provider of a wider set of crypto-related products and services, launch its blockchain-tracking software called Crystal. The product offers an in-depth look into any transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain, which involves advanced mapping and grouping tools, as well as a quantified assessment of the odds that a given transaction is illegal.As the widespread perception of a robust link that exists between cryptocurrency and cybercrime taints the whole industry, many crypto ventures are eager to prove the stereotype inaccurate. This push resulted in creation of Blockchain Alliance, a coalition of companies whose mission is to ‘provide a forum for open dialogue between industry and law enforcement and regulatory agencies’ while combating crimes that use public blockchain infrastructure. Along with providing software tools that have already been deployed by agencies such as Europol and the US Department of Homeland Security in some high-profile investigations, Blockchain Alliance emphasizes the need to educate law enforcement on the technology underlying cybercrimes and the most efficient ways to deal with it.Granted, innovation-minded generals and military technology experts have been long eyeing applications of blockchain such as military logistics, cyber defense, and resilient communications. Yet some even more exciting uses might be on the horizon, as the technology’s potential extends into command and control systems, and even further – onto the battlefield.For example, in October 2016, DARPA spent some $1.8 million to pay a software company named Galois for their Blockchain application Guardtime Keyless Signature Infrastructure – basically, an unhackable code that could be deployed to enhance security in critical weapon systems. Using a mathematical technique called formal verification, the program will ensure that the system is used as intended, and no malicious code is planted within.Pairing blockchain with artificial intelligence and military ‘Internet of Things' (IoT) could be the future of combat tactics, shifting from the centuries-old paradigm of centralized in-battle control to decentralized, at least at the unit level. Imagine a swarm of armed drones that continuously share combat data and decisions in a decentralized manner, operating as a unified organism that is not beholden to a single decision-making center and is capable of sustaining any casualties without losing operational capacity.Another field ripe for decentralization of command is complex fire systems, such as those found on modern battleships. For the last five decades, NATO navies’ vessels have relied on a centralized system of weapons control called Aegis Combat System – an ingenious yet centralized brain that collects data from dozens of sensors and coordinates fire from several types of deadly weapons simultaneously. Despite its age, it still works well, but the centralized character makes it vulnerable if the decision-making center gets taken out. A set of autonomous systems that coordinate via a blockchain could present a more viable design, retaining advantages of coordination but eliminating vulnerabilities inherent to central control."

The company emphasized that Bitmain is “one of the few companies” that offer mining tools for various cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin (BTC), Litecoin (LTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Ethereum (ETH), Dash (DASH), and Zcash (ZEC).Bitmain further specified the specifics of the firm’s business development, including their recent expansion with 11 new mining farms in the Sichuan Province, Xinjiang, and Inner Mongolia, as well as their operation of both the world’s largest and second largest Bitcoin mining pools in terms of CPU — BTC.com and Antpool.The company also highlighted the dynamics of its business in terms of financial growth, citing an exponential growth of revenue from $137.3 million in 2015 to about $2.5 billion in 2017. The company’s revenue has grown by more than 936 percent, from $274.5 million in the first six months of 2017 to around $2.8 billion in the first six months of this year through June 30, 2018.Founded in 2013, crypto mining giant Bitmain was reported to hold from 70 to 80 percent of the market for Bitcoin miners and ASIC chips in late February 2018. The company launched operations in Canada in 2016, and has reportedly considered expanding its business further outside of China, following a national ban of cryptocurrency exchanges and the increasing potential for energy regulations for mining crypto in China.Bitmain’s plans to hold an initial private offering (IPO) were first unveiled in June 2018, with Bitmain CEO Jihan Wu claiming that the company was “open” to launching an IPO with U.S. dollar denominated shares in a jurisdiction like Hong Kong. Following the reports, anonymous sources close to Bitmain confirmed in late July that the upcoming IPO was expected to be filed “very soon” in an overseas market.In mid-August, Cointelegraph reported on potentially misleading information about the investors of Bitmain’s rumored upcoming IPO, with a number of firms denying investments in a pre-IPO while reportedly being listed as investors.Both SoftBank and DST Global, which were reported as backing Bitmain’s IPO, have denied involvement in the deal. And in early September, Singapore-based investment company Temasek also officially denied investing in Bitmain, following reports of being one of the key investors in the pre-IPO funding round."

According to Emmer, “taxpayers can only comply with the law when the law is clear.” The representative further commented on the initiative:“The United States should prioritize accelerating the development of blockchain technology and create an environment that enables the American private sector to lead on innovation and further growth, which is why I am introducing these bills.”Moreover, Emmer has taken up the position of co-chairman of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus, a platform for the industry and government collaboration to examine the implications of blockchain and digital currencies. According to the announcement, “the Caucus believes in a hands-off regulatory approach to allow this technology to evolve the same way the Internet did; on its own.”Earlier this week, U.S. lawmakers called on the IRS to issue clarified and “comprehensive” crypto taxation guidance. The lawmakers argue that while the IRS has proactively continued to remind taxpayers of the penalties for non-compliance with its guidance, its failure to introduce a more robust taxation framework “severely hinders taxpayers' ability” to meet their obligations.Also this week, Cointelegraph reported that the American National Standards Institute is going to discuss blockchain and Artificial Intelligence (AI) issues at its next Legal Issues and Joint Member Forum.

The promise was made by Baylina on July 20 at the DappCon forum in Berlin, where important initiatives, tools and updates related to the Ethereum blockchain are traditionally discussed. The developer stated that the ERC-777 was ready to be launched and would be made fully available in August.","However, August has now come and gone, with the development team seemingly keeping silent — or possibly preparing a surprise — around the latest attempt to create a new standard on Ethereum blockchain. While no updates related to ERC-777 have appeared on GitHub since July, a Twitter post made by Baylina last week may give us a little clue about the upcoming release. And his teammate Jacques Dafflon put us even closer to ERC-777, though we still know nothing about the exact date of its release:We had more work and more feedback than anticipated and I had to focus on my thesis which delayed the work on the actual standard. I have to clarify a couple things in the standard and update the reference implementation. We hope to move ERC777 to last call soon as well.For now, let’s go back in time to better understand the background of such an initiative.Why was it necessary to change the most popular token standard in the world, which has served as the basis for more than 60,000 projects — including EOS, with a capitalization of more than $4.5 billion — and for the tokens of one of the world's largest crypto exchange, aka Binance? In order to answer this question, it is necessary to compare both existing and new standards, and then assess the risks of their application.While Bitcoin is considered the most popular cryptocurrency in the world, Ethereum is not only the second most popular cryptocurrency, but also the blockchain that led to a boom in crypto markets during 2016-2017. If there were no Ethereum platform, there would never have been the phrase ""to the moon"", which turned cryptocurrency from entertainment for geeks to a new tool for classical investors and millions of ordinary people in a matter of months.The main merits of the Ethereum blockchain include that the process of developing an application is extremely simple and the procedure for issuing a token using a smart contract goes off without the slightest hitch. Now, creating a token — that is, issuing a new crypto — can be done by anyone in one minute. This ease led to the explosive ICO boom. Another tool that could further contribute to the development of the ICO market was a single standard for tokens — and thus appeared ERC-20.Prior to standardization, Ethereum developers had to create a separate Solidity-based smart contract for each token. In fact, each time, it was necessary to create a new, unique type of smart contract. And the founders of an exchange or wallet had to write a unique code to support each new token. The more tokens that appeared, the more difficult this process became. In addition, tokens issued on unique smart contracts were poorly compatible with each other.Before ERC-20 was created, Ethereum developers have created a single standard for all tokens — the ERC-20, where ERC means ""Ethereum Request for Comment"" and 20 is the number of the community request, which in this case is arbitrary.The emergence of a single standard, which was released in 2015, revolutionized the crypto industry and became the central guideline, specifying which functions and events have to be implemented in a smart contract. Never before was the issuance, exchange and cash out of new currencies so simple.The standard contains the six mandatory parameters of a smart contract and is responsible for three main directions:1. Setting the initial distribution of tokens:totalSupply — determines the maximum number of tokens, which upon reaching, the smart contract stops issuance.balance0f — a function that assigns a primary number of tokens to any address.2. Transferring tokens:transfer — a function that moves tokens from the primary address to the address of the new owner following the results of an ICO.“transferFrom” — a function that moves tokens between users.3. Performing management functions:“approve” — a function to check the availability of tokens for a smart contract.“allowance” — a function to confirm that the address has enough tokens to initiate the transfer.Once this standard was formulated, exchanges and wallets were able to unify their code in order to handle any tokens created with the ERC-20 protocol. The growth of future applications using ETH then skyrocketed, as was expected.Developers of decentralized networks are programmers first and foremost, and then businessmen. Therefore, in decision making, one almost always follows formal logic. For example, some of developers might be not very concerned about a ""51 percent attack"" either because the coin itself depreciates or because the attack cost can exceed the profit received by a hacker. But it seems the organizers of such attacks have a completely different logic, which is proved by a big number of new attacks in 2018.The next thing that the developers did not overlook was considering a token’s functionality to be necessary only for an ICO launch but not for any additional services. This proved not to be the case — some teams, even those far from programming, began to explore possibilities of blockchain. For example, this led to appearance of tokens created for fun, as was the case of the Useless token.Other custom features could even damage users’ security. For example, some developers implemented the option of recharging exchange accounts through the simultaneous execution of the “approve” and “transferFrom” functions. The funds were written off from the sender's account but were not credited to their exchange balance, since the functionality of the recipient's smart contract as a deposit was not determined. The problem was that the Ethereum developers did not provide such an option for using this kind of transfer and did not prohibit it, and blockchain did not initially support the self-determination function of the contract. As a result, the owners of the cryptocurrency lost millions of dollars, disappearing into the network forever — as the money simply disappeared if the unfulfilled transaction was not immediately canceled by the sender.This vulnerability was noticed by security auditor Dexaran, who subsequently developed the ERC-223 standard, in which the “tokenFallback” function was added — which is launched if the “transferFrom” function isn’t performed. Despite the invention, however, this new function, created by the anonymous programmer, hasn’t yet received widespread acceptance.One more vulnerability has been detected by Lucas Cremer, a Solidity developer from Germany, in June, after Solidity update. It turned out that a significant percentage of ERC-20 tokens — which the author called “bad tokens” — behaved in yet another way regarding the return values of the transfer function. The transfer functions of these token contracts did not return anything. Indeed, among the affected tokens were those of Binance and OmiseGO. What one should be concerned about, Corner states, is that such assets could start behaving in an unpredictable way, and he warned that the bug needed to be fixed “as soon as possible.”Since tens of thousands of tokens, exchanges and wallets closely interact with ERC-20, its vulnerability is irremovable, — so the Ethereum developers have decided to issue a new standard with a name inspired by the lucky number 777.EIP (Ethereum Improvement Proposals) on ERC-777 were published on Nov. 20, 2017 and received the community’s approval. However, in order to fully function, the new standard needed an auxiliary ERC-820 protocol, which set the principles for the formation of a single register of smart contracts. With the help of this centralized registry, the main problem of the Ethereum blockchain — the impossibility of determining the functions performed by the contract — was solved.How does it work now? Any contracts with a description of the functions can be entered into the register once and for all; and, when executing a transaction, the blockchain can apply to the register to clarify the permissible actions. If a user attempts to perform an invalid operation with the tokens, they simply remain on the account and do not disappear.At Berlin's DappCon, Jodi Baylina and Jacques Dafflon explained the specifics of the new standard by using a new term — “hook” — to determine ""functions that can be called during a transfer."" These functions operate in conjunction with the ERC-820 protocol to provide a simple type of a detailed introspection which is lacking in ERC-20. Thus, it becomes possible to check whether a token possesses concrete features in order to perform or decline the operation, making the smart contract even smarter. The new ERC-777 standard will fix the problem of a recipient’s tokens being lost when sent to a contract that doesn’t support the receiving or managing such assets. Because of such a bug, the Ethereum community has already lost millions of dollars. A big part of the funds appear to be trapped inside some of the top ICO projects contracts forever. Here are some of them:However, protection against token loss as a result of incorrect transactions is not the only innovation of the new standard, which is aiming to further develop the blockchain.For example, ERC-777 creators built in a ‘trusted operator’ function for the first time, which can transfer and burn tokens on behalf of the owner. This is achieved by executing the ‘authorizeOperator’ function and can be used, for example, to perform instant, automatic payments in ETH.In addition, this standard allows you to check the address of the recipient for availability concerning ‘white’ or ‘black’ lists through the function ITokenRecipient. Additionally, the ‘hooks’ mentioned above make possible the monitoring of the behavior of a token, depending on the circumstances, which allow you to block certain addresses and perform a number of other actions — including the intervention by the sender and the receiver in the transaction process.If you need additional details on ERC-777, you can consult the relevant thread on Ethereum’s GitHub.A curtain call, number 20The ERC-777 standard is backward compatible with ERC-20, and any project based on the previous version of the standard can be transferred to the new one without problems. We can assume that the exchanges and wallets, which work with the tokens of the previous standard, will react positively to the initiation of ERC-777 -- which finally closes the legendary ‘hole’ in the Ethereum blockchain. In practice, this will mean simplifying the procedure for listing coins on the new standard, which could cause a new surge in activity in the crypto industry comparable to the wave of enthusiasm in 2016-2017.In addition, the new standard significantly expands the functionality of the Ethereum blockchain system, which will attract the attention of developers. Rampant discussion of the new standard serves as the brightest evidence.And finally, the ERC-777 standard contains completely redesigned functions and logic, which will avoid crosses with other tokens standards and confusion when executing smart contracts.Speaking about the disadvantages of ERC-777, yes, there is one: It relies on a centralized register of smart contracts — which is not an ideal approach within the decentralized ideology of blockchain. This will require additional measures from the Ethereum developers to ensure the security of its registry.A famous crypto YouTuber “Ivan on Tech” is sure that the success of ERC-777 is just a matter of time, even despite the fact that the Ethereum Foundation might be slow in writing off ERC-20 entirely:“Going forward, [the] Ethereum Foundation really [needs to get] behind ERC-777, and it could replace ERC-20, because it’s better. And therefore, it’s all about [the] Ethereum Foundation still has quite an influence and they are currently pushing for ERC-20. This is what they are advertising the most. But, in the future, it might be the case that we switch to ERC-777.”Perhaps, a new, promising token standard will give a fresh impetus to the development of the Ethereum network — and ETH, in particular, which has hit a new low since July: $194. Until then, while GitHub is keeping silent, there seems to be nothing better to do than just letting the Ethereum team finish their work — we know that they are good at it."

Per the above graphic, the main difference between the two bills consists of their approach to taxation.As Cointelegraph has explained, the first draft offers a five percent tax for individuals and legal entities operating with virtual currency assets, such as coins and tokens. Starting January 1, 2024, the tax for business revenues from crypto will rise up to 18 percent. This, the document states, might help Ukraine draw an additional 1.27 billion hryvnia ($43 million) to the budget annually from 2019-2024.As Cointelegraph reported earlier, Ukraine has repeatedly expressed its desire to create a national digital currency tied to local fiat (hryvnia).Ukraine’s draft cryptocurrency legislation also contains regulatory provisions against money laundering, terrorist financing, and other criminal activities.Earlier in June, Ukrainian police arrested four men who were suspected of running at least six fake cryptocurrency exchanges.

Andy Bromberg, co-founder and president of startup CoinList, told WSJ that “this sort of activity is rampant in the market right now. It hurts the market’s reputation, and it hurts individual investors.”According to WSJ, $80-million digital currency hedge fund Virgil Capital uses its own bots on a number of crypto exchanges around the world. Stefan Qin, managing partner of Virgil Capital, told WSJ that he is in a constant cat-and-mouse game with enemy bots.Per WSJ, Virgil lost funds on certain trades in Ethereum (ETH) earlier this year after a “harassing bot” targeted the fund. The WSJ further explains the strategy used by the bot:“The bot’s strategy was similar to ‘spoofing,’ a practice in which traders enter fake orders only to cancel them. The tactic, aimed at tricking other investors to buy or sell an asset by falsely signaling there is more supply or demand, was outlawed in U.S. stock and futures markets in 2010.”Another example of price manipulation in digital currencies cited by WSJ is trader Kjetil Eilertsen, who began trading Bitcoin (BTC) in 2011. Eilertsen reportedly developed a program called Quatloo Trader, that was promoted as “the best market-manipulation tool in the world of crypto.” The idea of the program is to make market manipulation easier by using built-in tools like a special tab called “whale tools,” which executes several “abusive strategies.”Eilertsen told WSJ that it is pointless to ban manipulation in digital currencies, and that it would more effective to provide manipulation tools to small traders. “If everybody can manipulate, then nobody is manipulating. You can’t ban anything from people who are dedicated to doing something,” Eilertsen told WSJ.Notably, similar programs are not permitted on traditional securities exchanges. The New York Stock Exchange regularly monitors operations for illegal trade activities and abusive trading, and punishes violators.Last week, the WSJ reported that nearly $90 million in illicit funds had been funneled through various crypto exchanges, including ShapeShift. Yesterday, ShapeShift founder and CEO Erik Vorhees refuted WSJ’s claims. He stated that the publication had misrepresented facts and made mistakes in their reporting due to a lack of knowledge of the exchange’s operations and blockchain technology."

compared to 8 percent for Bitcoin and 7 percent for other coins. Internet.","Sep 30, 2018","2017 was a big year for cryptojacking. It increased by 8,500 percent, according to figures published by Symantec in March. And it would seem that 2018 has so far been an even bigger year for mining malware, as the Cyber Threat Alliance September report revealed that, beginning on Jan. 1, cryptojacking still had room to increase by a further 500 percent.","However, beneath this simple outline of growth, there is a bigger, more complicated picture. Despite reports from some quarters showing that mining malware detections increased in the first two quarters of 2018, other reports suggest that they have in fact decreased.And while the overall growth in mining malware since last year has been attributed to the volatility of cryptocurrency prices and the existence of software bugs, other factors have played a significant role, such as the involvement of amateur cryptojackers and the cost of mining legitimately.If there's one dominant trend this year in the underworld of cryptojacking, it's that most mining malware focuses on Monero. Indeed, Palo Alto Networks revealed in July that Monero accounts for 84.5 percent of all detected malware, compared to 8 percent for Bitcoin and 7 percent for other coins.The reason for this is simple: Monero (XMR) is not only a privacy coin, but also the most valuable privacy coin by market cap — and 10th overall. Using the Cryptonight proof-of-work (PoW) algorithm, it mixes the user's inputs with those of other users, and it also uses ""ring confidential transactions"" that obscure the amount of XMR being transferred. It's therefore ideal for cybercriminals.Monero was already the most popular coin for cryptojackers in 2017, but a number of new developments have emerged in 2018 to distinguish this year from its predecessor. Most notably, cryptojacking is increasingly becoming the province of amateur 'hackers,' who are lured into the illicit activity by the cheap availability of mining malware and by obvious financial rewards. According to Russian cybersecurity firm Group-IB, the dark web is ""flooded with cheap mining software,"" which can often be purchased for as little as $0.50.Such software has become abundant this year: In 2017, Group-IB encountered 99 announcements regarding for-sale cryptojacking software on underground forums, while in 2018 it counted 477, signalling an increase of 381.8 percent. As the firm notes in its report:""Low entry barrier to the illegal mining market results in a situation where cryptocurrency is being mined by people without technical expertise or experience with fraudulent schemes.""In other words, cryptojacking has become a kind of hobbyist crime, popular among thousands of amateur hackers. This would perhaps account for why there has been a marked increase in detections this year, with Kaspersky Labs informing Cointelegraph that the number of PC cryptojacking victims increased from 1.9 million in 2016/17 to 2.7 million in 2017/18. Evgeny Lopatin — a malware analyst at Kaspersky Lab – shared:“The mining model […] is easier to activate and more stable [than other attack vectors]. Attack your victims, discreetly build cryptocurrency using their CPU or GPU power and then transfer that into real money through legal exchanges and transactions.”Of course, whenever “detections” are mentioned, the possibility arises that any increase is largely the result of an improvement in detection measures. “However, this is not the main driver here, as we see actual growth,” says Lopatin.“Our analysis shows that more and more criminals increasingly use crypto miners for malicious purposes across the world.”McAfee noted in a report from April that the vast majority of its detections were of CoinMiner, a piece of malware that surreptitiously inserts code taken from the CoinHive XMR mining algorithm into the victim's computer. This occurs when the victim downloads an infected file from the web, but what's new in 2018 is that such a vulnerability now affects Apple Macs as well, which had previously been regarded as much more secure than its Windows rivals.This development was noted by United States security firm Malwarebytes, which in a May blog post reported on the discovery of a new malicious crypto miner that harnesses the legit XMRig miner. Thomas Reed, the director of Mac and mobile at the company, wrote:""Often, Mac malware is installed by things like fake Adobe Flash Player installers, downloads from piracy sites, [and] decoy documents users are tricked into opening.""In fact, this wasn't the first piece of Mac mining malware it had discovered, with Reed stating that it ""follows other cryptominers for macOS, such as Pwnet, CpuMeaner and CreativeUpdate.""However, while cryptojacking has become more of an amateur-driven phenomenon, it still remains the case that many of this year’s exploits can be traced to more 'elite' sources. Cybersecurity firm Proofpoint reported at the end of January that Smominru, a cryptojacking botnet, had spread to over half a million computers — largely thanks to the National Security Agency, which had discovered a Windows bug that was then leaked online.This vulnerability is better known as EternalBlue, which most famously was responsible for the WannaCry ransomware attack/incident of May 2017. And according to Cyber Threat Alliance (CTA), it's another big factor in this year's 459 percent increase in cryptojacking.Worryingly, the CTA's report suggests that cryptojacking is only likely to increase as it becomes more successful and profitable:""[Cryptojacking's] influx of money could be used for future, more sophisticated operations by threat actor groups. For instance, several large-scale cryptocurrency mining botnets (Smominru, Jenkins Miner, Adylkuzz) have made millions of dollars.""And things are already bad enough in the present, with the CTA writing that infection by mining malware comes with steep costs for victims.""Taken in aggregate, when criminals install cryptocurrency miners in large enterprise networks, the costs in excess energy usage, degraded operations, downtime, repairs of machines with physical damage and mitigation of the malware in systems incurred by the victims far outweigh the relatively small amount of cryptocurrency the attackers typically earn on a single network.""The mention of costs is significant when it comes to cryptojacking, not just for (potential) victims, but also for perpetrators. That's because cryptojacking is essentially the theft of electricity and CPU, which implies that it will continue being prevalent not only for as long as Monero and other coins remain valuable, but also for as long as it remains expensive to mine XMR and other cryptos.According to CryptoCompare's profitability calculator for Monero, an individual U.S.-based miner using a graphics card capable of a 600 H/s hash rate (e.g., the Nvidia GTX 1080) and using 100W of power (a very conservative estimate) will make only $0.8033 in profit every month. This, clearly, isn't especially promising, which is a large part of the reason why so many amateurs have turned to cryptojacking, since mining XMR while paying for your own electricity just isn't fruitful when you're not a big mining company.There are, however, recent signs that Monero mining has become more profitable, even for the smaller miner. This came after its hard fork on April 6, which changed its PoW protocol so as to make it incompatible with ASIC miners, which tend to dominate mining (particularly in the case of Bitcoin).As soon as this hard fork was completed, reports came from the Monero subreddit that profitability had increased by 300 percent or even 500 percent, although this boost was soon lost in the following weeks, according to BitInfoCharts.Likewise, Monero itself has been cautious with regard to promising that it can resist ASIC mining equipment forever. ""Thus, it is recognized that ASICs may be an inevitable development for any proof-of-work [cryptocurrency],"" wrote developers dEBRYUNE and dnaleor in a February blog. ""We also concede that ASICs may be inevitable, but we feel that any transition to an ASIC-dominated network needs to be as egalitarian as possible in order to foster decentralization.""Assuming that it has become more profitable to mine XMR legitimately, this would account for a flattening in cryptojacking growth that has been observed by some cybersecurity firms. In its Q2 2018 report, Malwarebytes revealed that mining malware detections dropped from a peak of 5 million at the beginning of March, to a low of 1.5 million at the beginning of June. This decline may contradict what other analysts have reported this year, but given that Malwarebytes' research is the most recent in terms of the dates covered, it's arguably the most authoritative.It's not clear whether this decline is the result of an increase in profitability for legit Monero miners, of business and individuals wising up to the threat of cryptojacking, or of a general decline in the value of cryptocurrencies. Regardless, Malwarebytes predict that ""Cryptocurrency miners will be going out of style"" as a cybersecurity threat. ""Of course, we are still going to see plenty of miners being distributed and detected,"" its report concludes. ""However, it looks like we are at the tail end of the ‘craze.'"""

than ...","Oct 1, 2018",A platform designed to help investors keep track of their cryptocurrency trades and the performance of portfolios has revealed some of the biggest trends they have learned during their five years in operation.,"To commemorate its anniversary, CoinTracking revealed how it has noticed that the trade behavior of its users intensifies when the price of a coin rises – with their analysis indicating that the best-performing portfolios hold between seven and twelve coins at any given time.Since it was founded in 2013, the company says it has been struck by how many exchanges make it difficult for investors to analyze their trades, in part because these platforms fail to offer insights on realized or unrealized gains.The platform also believes that tax authorities and certified public accountants are still struggling to create tax reports for cryptocurrencies – in part because they have limited knowledge on how to do so. CoinTracking supports eight different methods for calculating tax liabilities and says these customizable reports can comply with the standards of “almost every country in the world,” enabling users to save time and money while staying on the right side of the law.CoinTracking says that it aims to appeal to users of all levels – ranging from casual traders to more experienced investors. Its three-tier subscription plan aims to reflect this. A free plan allows users to track a maximum of 200 transactions, with its Pro plan enabling 3,500 transactions to be tracked. As the name suggests, the Unlimited plan is free of restrictions – and offers other features such as exports in six file types, prioritized caching and faster calculations, a daily backup of all trades and guaranteed access to all future platform updates. Pro and Unlimited plans can be purchased using Bitcoin or fiat for one year, two years, or for lifetime use.The platform now supports more than 6,000 cryptocurrencies. Not only does it offer trends for each of these coins, but CoinTracking says it provides nine years of historical data to help investors make informed decisions – including interactive charts and a calculation of key indicators. People who currently use other prominent crypto exchanges and wallets can also import data with ease, and use an intuitive search feature which groups trades by the exchange where they were executed.The company’s journey began in 2012 when Dario Kachel, an IT professional, started to get interested in trading on crypto exchanges. Although he loved the excitement and the challenges associated with these investments, he found it difficult to keep track of all his trades and achieve a bird’s eye view of how his portfolio was performing.Although he initially developed a spreadsheet to keep tabs on his trades, he soon found this manual method laborious and time consuming, and this motivated him to begin developing software that would benefit him and the other crypto traders who were suffering from the same problem.Disclaimer.

In order to provide an easy-to-use customer experience, Coinbase Consumer quotes a price and then quickly fills the order from our exchange platform (Coinbase Markets). This takes advantage of the liquidity provided by the entire Coinbase ecosystem.”The firm thus emphasized that “self-trading” – as the information had been misconstrued by third-party reporting – inaccurately distorts what is in reality “customer-driven volume via Coinbase Consumer.” The statement repeatedly reinforces the fact that the exchange is neither operating a proprietary trading desk, nor undertaking “market making actions.”Coinbase received a BitLicense from the New York State Department of Financial Services (DFS) in January 2017, which has been required for all New York crypto trading firms as of August of 2015.In a previous statement, Coinbase had outlined that its participation in the NY Virtual Markets Integrity report and questionnaire was intended to shed light on a range of steps the exchange has been undertaking to address matters of compliance with federal and state regulators, which include measures to address cybersecurity, market integrity and platform reliability."

The breach was initially revealed by a community member, and XMR developers were quick enough to fix it before any damage was done.","Simply put, Monero (XMR) is a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin (BTC), but with an additional focus on anonymity. It was established in 2014, when bitcointalk.org user thankful_for_today forked the codebase of Bytecoin into the name BitMonero. To establish the new coin, he used ideas that were first outlined in a 2013 white paper called ‘Cryptonote’ that was written by an anonymous personality Nicolas van Saberhagen. Ironically, BitMonero was soon forked itself by open-source developers, and titled ‘Monero’ (which means ‘coin’ in Esperanto). It has remained to be an open-source project ever since.XMR has considerably more privacy properties than BTC: Instead of just being a decentralized coin, Monero is designed to be fully anonymous and virtually untraceable. Thus, XMR is based on the CryptoNight proof-of-work (PoW) hash algorithm, which allows it to use ‘ring signatures’ (which mix the spender's address with a group of others, making it more difficult to trace transactions), ‘stealth addresses’ (which are generated for each transaction and make it impossible to discover the actual destination of a transaction by anyone else other than the sender and the receiver), and ‘ring confidential transactions’ (which hide the transferred amount).In 2016, XMR experienced more growth in market capitalization and transaction volume than any other cryptocurrency (almost a 2800 percent increase, as per CoinMarketCap). A lot of that growth came from the underground economy. Being an altcoin that is tailor-made for fully private transactions, Monero eventually became accepted as a form of currency on darknet markets like Alphabay and Oasis. Specifically, after being integrated on the darknet in the summer of 2016, its value “immediately increased around sixfold,” according to Wired.""That uptick among people who really need to be private is interesting,"" Riccardo Spagni, one of the Monero core developers, told the publication in January 2017. ""If it’s good enough for a drug dealer, it’s good enough for everyone else.""Monero’s alleged privacy remains to be a controversial topic, as some suggest that the coin is not in fact fully anonymous. In an August interview with Bloomberg, the United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) special agent Lilita Infante noted that although privacy-focused currencies are less liquid and more anonymous than BTC, the DEA “still has ways of tracking” altcoins such as Monero and Zcash. Infante concluded:“The blockchain actually gives us a lot of tools to be able to identify people. I actually want them to keep using [cryptocurrencies].”Interestingly, while Europol’s latest cybercrime report suggests that BTC remains the most popular cryptocurrency for criminal activities, it also predicts a rise in the demand for anonymity-focused altcoins, including Monero (XMR).The privacy-focused nature of Monero also prevents it from being listed on some compliant crypto exchanges. For instance, in June, Japan-based Coincheck delisted XMR and three other anonymity-focused altcoins to follow Counter-Terrorist Financing (CFT) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) procedures issued by the local financial regulator.On Sept. 18, user u/s_c_m_l described a hypothetical attack within the XMR ecosystem on the Monero official subreddit:“I can imagine an attack where ‘A’ procures [a] large amount of XMR and [sends] it to ‘Exchange B’ in many transactions with the same stealth address. ‘A’ then exchanges that XMR for other currency and cashes out, leaving the exchange paralyzed [and] unable to use that XMR.”Importantly, the Monero blockchain ‘burns’ XMR transactions between identical stealth addresses, seeing them as illegitimate. Instead, just one single ‘correct’ transaction could go through. Burned XMR, in turn, are fully unusable, as they cannot be replaced.More specific details on the attack were described in a Monero blog post:“An attacker first generates a random private transaction key. Thereafter, they modify the code to merely use this particular private transaction key, which ensures multiple transactions to the same public address (e.g., an exchange's hot wallet) are sent to the same stealth address. Subsequently, they send, say, a thousand transactions of 1 XMR to an exchange. Because the exchange's wallet does not warn for this particular abnormality (i.e., funds being received on the same stealth address), the exchange will, as usual, credit the attacker with 1000 XMR.“The attacker then sells his XMR for BTC and lastly withdraws this BTC. The result of the hacker’s action(s) is that the exchange is left with 999 unspendable/burned outputs of 1 XMR.”Simply put, the bug basically allowed hackers to burn the funds of an organization's wallet — such as that of an exchange — while only having to pay the network transaction fees. Although they wouldn’t obtain any money from doing so, “there are probably means to indirectly benefit,” as Monero team suggested. For instance, the attackers could manipulate the market, as they would have the control over the coin supply of XMR.The Redditor’s theory became widely discussed within the Monero subreddit, and the developers reached out with a public announcement only after fixing the issue. On Sept. 25, Monero team declared that a private patch was “promptly created and later included in the code” after discovering the potential vulnerability. After that, they reportedly notified “as many exchanges, services and merchants as possible,” explaining that the patch had to be applied on top of the v0.12.3.0 release branch.In an accompanying blog post, Monero developers argued that this was “clearly not the preferred method” because some parts of the Monero ecosystem were still left out, but there was limited time to eliminate the bug. After that, the glitch was announced via public mailing, as it is “imperative to be subscribed to the public mailing list” for any organization that deals with Monero, developers argued.Finally, Monero claims that the bug “did not affect the protocol and thus the coin supply was not affected,” hence no attackers were quick enough to actually exploit the bug.This was not the first security concern regarding Monero within the past month. In early September, Twitter and Reddit users started to point out that the MEGA Chrome extension was compromised. The MEGA Chrome extension is a tool that claims to improve browser performance by reducing page loading times, as well as providing a cloud storage service.Redditor u/gattacus posted on Monero’s official subreddit that the MEGA Chrome extension version 3.39.4 seemed conspicuous:“There was an update to the extension and Chrome asked for new permission (read data on all websites). That made me suspicious and I checked the extension code locally (which is mostly javascript anyways). MEGA also has the source code of the extension on github […] There was no commit recently. To me it looks either their Google webstore account was hacked or someone inside MEGA did this. Pure speculation though.”The application was removed from Chrome webstore after roughly four hours. Later, the MEGA team clarified that version 3.39.4 was a malicious update performed by unknown hackers with the aim of compromising users’ private information. Soon, it became clear that the attack didn’t center around Monero specifically, as the malicious code was reportedly activated on websites such as Amazon, Google, Microsoft, GitHub and MyEtherWallet along with Monero XMR web wallet services. This time, the fault wasn’t on Monero’s end.The ‘burning bug,’ in turn, was possible due to a flaw in XMR’s code, but the developers were quick to react to the warning signal raised by the altcoin’s community."

Ramy Kamaneh, CEO of Wuhan General Group, said:""We had planned to build this operation three months ago, but with the bearish cryptocurrency market, we took a step back to reassess our strategy.

The company was shut down in 2015 following allegations of operating as a Ponzi scheme, which was followed by a lawsuit in 2016.Created by GAW Miners developers, the PayCoin cloud mining cryptocurrency was launched in 2014. The digital currency was based on the SHA-256 algorithm and both proof-of-work (PoW) and proof-of-stake (PoS) protocols.While GAW Miners had reportedly “guaranteed” investors a $20 floor price for PayCoin, the highest XPY price was $15.92 instead, according to CoinMarketCap.In late August, the alleged former owner of crypto exchange BTC-e Alexander Vinnik was indicted and subjected to a ""fake"" interrogation by French prosecutors in a Greek Court. Following a protracted legal battle and several lower court rulings, the Greek Supreme Court eventually ruled to extradite Vinnik to Russia."

According to the World Bank, there are 1.7 billion adults globally who remain unbanked, yet two-thirds of them own a mobile phone that they could use for online banking. The Nebeus’ campaign went live on Sept. 24, 2018 and has already attracted more than 400,000 pounds ($527,490).","Backed by industry expert Brett King, the Nebeus campaign will last until October 23, 2018. Currently operating in 45 countries, they now plan for expansion across Europe, Asia and South America. The company wants to make banking simple for people and encourages a wider use of cryptocurrency in everyday spending, offering user-friendly Bitcoin wallets and its recently launched Exo card. The new prepaid card allows users to seamlessly convert crypto into fiat, making transactions convenient online, offline and even at ATMs.“We want to create an ecosystem where those who add value are rewarded, and thosewho consume services and products can do so in a competitive and secureenvironment, built on blockchain technology. Our current campaign will bring us a stepcloser to achieving this,” Konstantin Zaripov, co-founder and CEO of Nebeus, said.Nebeus is a new crypto bank which facilitates crypto-collateral Bitcoin loans globally. The company says it is working on “bridging the gap between crypto and fiat finance through the use of blockchain technology.” According to the company, 30,000 users of the Nebeus platform have already created active blockchain-based wallets.The fintech startup was founded in 2014, and the peer-to-peer (p2p) exchange platform was launched at the end of 2017. Nebeus has already enabled the transaction of 34 million euro ($39.9 million) and facilitated 1.9 million pounds ($2.23 million) in p2p Bitcoin loans. Their trading platform allows users to purchase and sell Bitcoin and Ethereum with instant deposits into their accounts.Nebeus’s open API allows third parties to develop value-added products and services on top of the Nebeus platform or incorporate Nebeus’s services into their existing ecosystems.The Nebeus card, launched in the summer of 2018, allows for converting cryptocurrency into fiat and also has some additional features. For example, all the users’ cryptocurrencies can be stored, easily accessed and managed in a Crypto Basket. Moreover, the Nebeus card functions as a regular debit card. It is accepted in over 40 million locations and can be used in stores, for online payments or for ATM withdrawals. The card can be issued to consumers worldwide.In June 2018, Nebeus announced it was entering the African market through local telecommunications and mobile money. The company said that cryptocurrency users in Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Rwanda, South Africa, Nigeria and Ghana have received full access to the startup’s “crypto bank.” The company expects to enable over 400 million people with crypto services through help of local partners that already have an established network in the region.Some of the latest research from the World Bank proves that Nebeus’s targeting of mobile money is justified. The organization’s analytics came to the conclusion that “in Sub-Saharan Africa, mobile money drove financial inclusion.” While the share of adults with an account with a financial institution remained flat in the region, the share with a mobile money account has almost doubled since 2014. Moreover, mobile money accounts have spread from East Africa to West Africa and beyond.However, there are still a lot of unbanked adults in other continents too. According to the World Bank, account ownership in Europe and Central Asia was 65 percent in 2017 (58 percent of adults in 2014) and 71 percent in East Asia and the Pacific.Disclaimer.

99,https://cointelegraph.com,"Oct 5, 2018",Corrupt Governance? What We Know About Recent EOS Scandal,https://cointelegraph.com/news/corrupt-governance-what-we-know-about-recent-eos-scandal,"Those are decentralized bodies who, well, produce the blocks of EOS 
blockchain — just like miners do within the Bitcoin's (BTC) blockchain.","Oct 5, 2018","This week, EOS found itself in hot water after allegations arose that a major part of its blockchain governnance, led by Chinese crypto exchange Huobi may be involved in a corruption scheme. EOS’ parent company and Huobi have issued public statements since these allegations, but refrained from admitting or denying the charges.","EOS.io is a blockchain-powered smart contracts protocol for the development, hosting, and execution of decentralized applications (dApps). It aims to operate in a way similar to the web-based applications and retains similar structural principles, which makes it comparable to Google’s Play Store or Apple’s App Store.EOS.io is supported by the native cryptocurrency EOS, currently the fifth largest crypto by total market cap. Those tokens could be staked for using network resources either for personal use or leased out for developers use — as per the project’s whitepaper, dApp developers can build their product on the top of the EOS.io protocol and make use of the servers, bandwidth and computational power of EOS itself, as those resources are distributed equally among EOS cryptocurrency holders. Hence, EOS.io attempts to represent a decentralized alternative to cloud hosting services.The EOS.io platform was launched in June 2018 as open-source software. Its first test nets and the original whitepaper emerged earlier in 2017. The platform was developed by block.one, a startup registered in the Cayman Islands and lead by Daniel Larimer and Brendan Blumer.EOS holds the absolute record in terms of funds raised during initial coin offerings (ICOs): it has managed to gather around $4.1 billion worth of investments, or about 7.12 million Ethereum, after fundraising for nearly a year. Its predecessor, messenger Telegram, has raised less than half this much - $1.7 billion.EOS employs a consensus model called Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPOS). That means that its investors are rewarded with voting power and decide who gets to mine the EOS blockchain.Indeed, the EOS network is constantly governed by a total of 21 block producers (BPs). Those are decentralized bodies who, well, produce the blocks of EOS blockchain — just like miners do within the Bitcoin’s (BTC) blockchain. In reward, BPs earn EOS tokens produced by inflation. The total inflation of EOS tokens is reportedly 5 percent, only 1 percent of which goes to BPs.Whilst BPs have the option to keep the tokens, they are also encouraged to reinvest them “to create better infrastructure growth, better community and financial support, along with better education on the EOS network and EOS dApps”, as blockchain analyst and tool builder Ben Sigman explains in a Medium post.BPs are elected through the voting system since June 2018, when the mainnet went online. EOS’s total supply is set at 1,000,000,000 (1 billion), and the EOS main platform was fully activated, or handed over to the community, when 15 percent of total circulating supply had voted. That occured on June 14, when 21 EOS block producers primarily from the US, China, and South America came ahead in the voting race. The voting process with EOS is constant — that means that the top 21 is fluid and BP candidates who earn enough votes can replace the BPs in power any minute.The supposedly democratic voting system soon showed its flaws: for instance, cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex secured its position as a block producer allegedly due to the votes of just few EOS holders, one of which accounted for 27 percent of all votes for Bitfinex, as community members pointed out on Reddit.‘Mutual voting’, in turn, would imply a process when block producers are voting for each other in order to remain in power and keep their passive income - according to some estimations, top three EOS BPs earn around 1000 EOS per day. That process violates Article IV of the current EOS Constitution titled “No Vote Buying”, which states the following:“No Member shall offer nor accept anything of value in exchange for a vote of any type, nor shall any Member unduly influence the vote of another.”Moreover, the EOS voting system seems to be designed for casual users who vote with their private wallets, whilst investors who have their EOS tokens on exchanges’ wallets appear to be stripped off of their voting rights — instead, they are passed over to the exchanges who hold their tokens. While Bitfinex has attempted to introduce a scheme that would allow its customers holding EOS to participate in the voting, other exchanges have remained inactive on the matter.This problem was recently discussed by members of Chinese EOS Community, who argued whether exchanges should be allowed to vote with customer funds. As per the meeting notes posted in English, “general consensus was mixed between yes and no, but favored yes with the caveat that all voter participation must be increased [... and] exchanges should be expected to provide greater transparency to their voting selection process”.The allegations were originally raised by Eosone, a non-profit supervisor of BPs and builder of EOS ecosystem who regularly reports on BPs’ activities. On September 26, Eosone posted what it claims was an Excel spreadsheet of the large Chinese cryptocurrency exchange Huobi, currently the fifth largest exchange by reported volume globally per Coinmarketcap, that was allegedly leaked by its former employee Shi Feifei.The supposedly leaked document includes four tables with titles ""node mutual voting table"" and ""node income statement"" among them. Eosone implied that chief EOS BPs, including Huobi, which is bthe fourth largest BP in current producer ranking, according to EOS Titan data, were involved in mutual voting along with pay-offs.According to the explanation of Twitter user and EOS investor Maple Leaf Capital, who summarized the document’s findings in English, Huobi voted for 20 other BPs, and 16 of them voted back for Huobi. Moreover, Huobi allegedly voted for three other BPs in exchange for significant paybacks:“Huobi votes for eosiosg11111, cochainworld, and eospaceioeos in exchange for 170, 150, and 50 percent of the returns respectively...”Maple Leaf Capital also argued that such agreements could ""increasingly compromise the integrity of the network,"" noting that at least 12 of 21 major BPs were controlled by Chinese entities:""This file documents the collusion, mutual voting, and pay-offs that occur amongst the Chinese BP community.""Thus, Maple Leaf Capital essentially accused a number of Chinese companies of forming a cartel to collude together, adding:“I view such action with utter disgust, and there is a reason why our Mapleleafcap proxy only votes for a very selective [sic] group of Chinese BPs.”Furthermore, the Twitter user linked the alleged mutual voting with the recent promotion of Huobi Pool Token (HPT,) which shared tokens with users in exchange for locking their EOS on Huobi. The Chinese crypto exchange might then capitalize those votes, Maple Leaf concluded.On October 1, Block.one’s CEO Brendan Blumer published a statement addressing EOS public blockchain governance problem. In it, he neither confirmed nor denied the allegations, stating his company is “aware of some unverified claims regarding irregular block producer voting, and the subsequent denials of those claims”.Without specifying which “denials” of allegations he referred to, Blumer stated that EOS will continue to “ensure a free and democratic election process and [...] vote with other holders to reinforce the integrity of this process”:“We continue working on our potential involvement with the goal of empowering the intent of the greater community through a transparent process that incorporates community feedback.”On October 2, Huobi responded to the accusations. In a brief statement, the exchange said an investigation into the allegations was “still ongoing”:“Based on the initial investigation, there were no financial contracts involved between Huobi and any third party… The investigation is still on-going [sic] and therefore, we seek your patience and co-operation [sic] in this matter.”Previously, on September 26, Danny Wu, Senior Manager at Huobi Pool, defended against the allegations on Telegram, claiming that the document in question was faked by their former employee.Expectedly, the alleged Huobi spreadsheet provoked a major backlash in the EOS community and beyond.EOS Alliance, an non-profit organization formed by EOS community members and block producers with the role to “facilitate the dialogue within community”, has released a statement on the situation:“Dan Larimer’s Delegated Proof of Stake (DPOS) was designed with the requirement that 15 of 21 independent votes are required to operate the network securely. If, as some alleged recently, some current Block Producers are coordinating together, this might call into question the transactional reliability of the EOS blockchain data for all users and the attractiveness of EOS as a platform for dApps.”Additionally, EOS Alliance stressed that “there are geopolitical considerations, given that Chinese corporations and investors are potentially being demonized, and the consequences in China might be more dire for the individuals involved than they would be in other countries”.The community’s reaction on EOS’s official Reddit channel seems mixed. “I don't find that surprising giving the governance model of EOS.”, wrote user bhiitc. “If you optimize your system under the assumption that most players aren't malicious and thus reduce the number of nodes for more transactions per seconds, such an outcome like this was likely”.Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin commented on the aforementioned thread started by Maple Leaf Capital, arguing the vote-trading was “completely predictable”:“Interesting! I mean, it was completely predictable and I did predict it,  but I did not expect it to happen so thoroughly and so soon!”Buterin also criticized the very system of EOS nodes:“As a followup, *this* is why I do not believe in coinholder-voted on-chain treasuries. Any chain where coinholder-voted on-chain issuance is used to supposedly fund public goods can easily collapse into this kind of ‘I vote for your crappy project, you vote for mine’ equilibrium.”Interestingly, the Ethereum co-founder has criticized the EOS voting system before. In August 2017, Buterin clashed with EOS’ Daniel Larimer after he responded to an Ethereum Reddit thread post claiming that EOS was superior to Ethereum in terms of number of transactions and flexibility.In his comment, Buterin mentioned that EOS’s reliance on voting, among other features, is problematic, and the scenarios where “exchanges would vote on users' behalf, with users not really caring how exchanges vote with their money” were “likely to happen”."

Crypto Market Trading — Inside Look ...","Sep 28, 2018","The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) has decided to extend its restrictions on contracts for differences (CFDs), including crypto-based ones. The agency has announced its decision in an official release published Friday, September 28.","A CFD is a contract signed between a buyer and a seller, which stipulates that the difference between the current value of an asset and its value at contract time will be compensated by the seller if positive, or by the buyer if negative.According to ESMA’s release, the restrictions, which originally came into effect on August 1, will be renewed for another three months from November 1. The agency has justified its move by ""significant investor protection concern"" associated with the offering of CFDs to retail clients.As Cointelegraph reported earlier, before the first restrictions were imposed by ESMA, the leverage limit for cryptocurrency CFDs was at 5:1. But since August it is fixed at 2:1, which implies that crypto investors must possess at least half of a contract’s specified volume upon opening it.In January, ESMA issued a Call for evidence which considered a possible interference with digital coin CFDs. The paper stated that the volatility of  cryptocurrency prices raised doubts about sufficient investor protection.In March, ESMA strengthened its requirements for CFDs. ""Due to the specific characteristics of cryptocurrencies as an asset class the market for financial instruments providing exposure to cryptocurrencies, such as CFDs, will be closely monitored, and ESMA will assess whether stricter measures are required,"" the watchdog explained back then.Other EU regulators have also treated crypto investing with caution. As Cointelegraph reported back in February, the European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) warned customers that cryptocurrencies are “highly risky” assets that show “clear signs of a pricing bubble.”Different EU countries are seeking ways to approach crypto derivatives. For instance, French stock market regulator urged to regulate crypto assets under EU law and prohibited to advertise them online. Austria also proposed to supervise them using trading rules already in place for gold. And a UK watchdog has required businesses to receive authorization before dealing with crypto derivatives."

Related News. Bitcoin Dominance Growing — What It Could Mean for ...","Sep 15, 2018","This week, on the same day, two United States regulating bodies — the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and its ruling organization the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) — reported filing objections against non-compliant crypto players who made some false statements regarding their businesses.","While the SEC barely needs any introduction for those who follow the crypto industry, FINRA might seem unfamiliar. FINRA is a private, non-federal agency, although it is overseen by the SEC. It regulates one specific part of the securities industry in the U.S.: brokerage firms doing business with the public.What makes the news particularly interesting is that both agencies seemingly extended their purviews, as FINRA targeted a questionable crypto security and the SEC turned its attention to funds managing virtual currencies. And as the icing on the cake, a New York federal judge ruled that U.S. securities laws were applicable for dealing with crypto fraud allegations — all on the same day, Sept. 11.FINRA has filed a complaint against a Massachusetts resident Timothy Tilton Ayre. The watchdog charged him with securities fraud and the illegal distribution of an unregistered cryptocurrency called HempCoin (HMP) (not to be confused with the company of the same name that trades THC tokens).Here’s brief background: In April 2016, Ayre started advertising HMP as “the first minable coin backed by marketable securities” and a security backed by common stock, arguing that every 10 coins represented one share of his public company Rocky Mountain Ayre Inc. (RMTN).Ayre’s HempCoins premiered on exchanges C-Cex and Yobit. More than than 81 million HMP coins were mined in late 2017 and traded on the aforementioned platforms. Currently, HMP is not listed at any exchange and its market cap totals a modest $104,463, according to CoinMarketCap. Ayre’s cryptocurrency has also seemingly erased all of its social media presence, while its former website reroutes to some unrelated content.Thus, in the recent complaint, FINRA states that Ayre’s claims were “fraudulent, positive statements about RMTN’s business and finances.” As Ayre never attempted to register the coin, FINRA chose to charge the RMTN president with the unlawful distribution of an unregistered security.In the press release, FINRA reminded that anyone named in its complaint can file a response and request a hearing. If the agency confirms there were violations, Ayre might face a fine, censure, suspension or be barred from the securities industry altogether.FINRA’s action came on the same day as its overseer, the SEC, issued two separate cease-and-desist orders along with fines.First, the SEC filed a cease-and-desist against Crypto Asset Management (CAM) fund and its founder Timothy Enneking, who reportedly presented CAM as the ""first regulated crypto asset fund in the United States.” CAM raised $3.6 million from 44 investors in late 2017, bringing its net asset value to $37 million.According to the filing, the fund has, in fact, ""never been registered with the Commission in any capacity."" Тhe watchdog stresses that CAM “wilfully” broke the law by claiming to have the necessary credentials associated with holding and trading securities.After the SEC reached out to CAM, the fund agreed to stop its public offering and offered a buyback to investors. CAM has also agreed to pay the $200,000 fine, although he didn’t admit or deny guilt to the allegations.The SEC’s second notice addressed TokenLot, a crypto broker-dealer lead by Lenny Kugel and Eli L. Lewitt. TokenLot marketed itself an “ICO superstore.” According to the regulator, Kugel and Lewitt also breached the law by failing to register their business in the country. Similarly to CAM, TokenLot has already agreed to pay a $471,000 fine but did not admit or deny the findings.The regulatory scrutiny for virtual currencies in the U.S. is likely to become even more thorough, as Sept. 11 featured yet another precedent: A New York judge ruled that securities laws can be applicable for prosecuting crypto fraud allegations, in what appeared to be the first U.S. court case to address the matter.The case was filed against Brooklyn resident Maksim Zaslavskiy. Prosecutors have claimed that in 2017, he gained a minimum $300,000 from investors for a cryptocurrency called REcoin, which claimed to be backed by real estate, and Diamond, supposedly underpinned by diamonds. Investigators state that no real estate or diamonds in fact supported the digital assets.As a result, U.S. District Judge Raymond Dearie ruled that federal securities laws should be interpreted “flexibly,” dismissing a motion from Zaslavskiy’s lawyers to drop the charges on the grounds that the cryptocurrencies didn’t fall under the Securities Exchange Act.As per Reuters, Dearie’s statement and other filings in Zaslavskiy’s case did not mention any similar court decisions on applying federal securities law to crypto-related fraud cases.Thus, U.S. regulators have been increasingly focused on the crypto market as of late. Importantly, this week’s news might mark an extension of the watchdogs’ action on the field of cryptocurrencies, as both the FINRA’s and SEC’s action this week were apparent firsts, while the N.Y. court decision also seems to have set a new precedent.Indeed, FINRA has reportedly never issued any disciplinary action within the crypto industry until now. The agency’s arrival could be expected, though, as FINRA published a guide on how to avoid crypto scams just several days before the HempCoin case was announced.The SEC, in turn, has publicly addressed crypto hedge funds in an apparent first as well. There were more than 226 funds managing digital assets who controlled at least a combined $3.5 billion, as of February 2018, according to Autonomous NEXT research. The first signs that they had triggered the SEC’s attention arose in March 2018, when Bloomberg, citing anonymous sources, reported that the agency sent a number of requests to crypto-focused funds regarding their compliance, and even allegedly issued subpoenas for some of them.In separate news for the U.S. industry, a group of resident crypto-related companies — including Coinbase, Protocol Labs and Digital Currency Group — teamed up to form the Blockchain Association, the “first” lobbying group representing the blockchain industry in Washington, D.C. It will represent mainstream companies that look to operate within the political system, address policy issues and the treatment of crypto by U.S. tax law, as well as collaborate with lawmakers on Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) policy development within the industry.The events mentioned above follow U.S. Rep. Bill Huizenga’s July speech, when the lawmaker argued that Congress should empower financial regulators such as the SEC to regulate the cryptocurrency market in compliance with the same rules governing other currencies and stocks.Nevertheless, for now, U.S. regulatory bodies still haven’t come up with one definitive scheme to regulate the crypto industry, as watchdogs continue to approach them differently, depending on their competence. In May, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) chairman, Chris Giancarlo, stated he doesn’t see comprehensive crypto legislation coming from the federal level in the near future, pointing out that the statutes by which the CFTC is operating were written in 1935."

With the rate of Bitcoin dropping almost by half after the sharp rise in December, individual miners with consumer-level hardware couldn’t keep up with the pace anymore. It is one of the reasons why cloud mining providers have been a popular choice lately - especially when it comes to mining the world’s most wanted cryptocurrencies.","Cloud-based mining is an easy and fast way to get access to industrial-grade mining without having to buy, maintain and upgrade expensive equipment, or deal with high levels of noise and heat. Users rent the computing power they need, while all the technical issues are handled by the leaser.As the demand for cloud mining rose, the number of cloud mining companies also started to increase. With time, some turned out to be straightforward scams, some honestly went bankrupt, unable to deal with the enormous expenses on electricity. Those that survived and prospered - and those that are emerging now - have to acknowledge the fact that can be a massive blow to one’s wallet and our ecology. According to estimates of economist Alex de Vries, at the moment the Bitcoin network alone consumes as much power as Ireland does. Given the amounts of energy needed to power hash calculations, an inventive approach is called for.Hashtoro, a cloud service aimed at mining Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum, is a new generation solution created by industry professionals. Launched in May 2018, the project has been so successful that three months later it announced limiting contracts due to high demand. What’s the secret? There’s none. Hashtoro has been openly sharing its recipe of prosperity in the midst of the crisis that the crypto world is facing today: almost the new mining philosophy.""The key to creating a profitable cloud mining service is minimizing the costs. Our approach is based on three E’s: easy, efficient, eco-friendly. Careful choice of farm locations and use of clean energy allowed us to save both money and resources, and offer cheap contracts with a low maintenance fee. We make mining more accessible than ever"", - says Alexander Petersons, Hashtoro’s product director.Hashtoro is the first “green” cloud mining service. The mining farms are located in ecologically progressive, crypto-friendly European countries and fully powered by renewable energy sources. “Even the excess heat produced by our equipment is put to use - it warms the water for the local community”, - adds Alexander.  The main features of Hashtoro mining service are:Hashtoro places cloud mining literally a few clicks away from the end user. There is no need for big investments: 20 euro is the minimal amount required to enter the system. The setup is quick and easy: it’s possible to start mining right after making the payment.Efficiency is key in making profit from mining popular coins. Hashtoro’s farms are equipped with cutting-edge Bitmain ASIC miners. Today more and more experts are agreeing on the fact that ASIC miners remains the most effective tool in the market and provide better protection from 51% attacks. Furthermore, the company has announced that in the nearest future it will start developing their own ASIC chip. According to R&D’s estimates, it will give an increase to mining efficiency.The mining process is controlled by a neural network that picks the optimal tactics: for example, it dynamically switches to mining the coin which is most profitable to mine at the moment. At the end of the day, all the mined coins are automatically converted to the cryptocurrency chosen by the user. Tests performed by Hashtoro show that this strategy gives 10% more profit. User balance, revenue forecast, and real-time statistics are available at the Dashboard 24/7.When Bitcoin price skyrocketed in 2017, the number of cyber-fraud cases increased. The possibility of easy profits at others’ expense attracted the attention of numerous scammers and fraudsters. Since cloud-based mining services let through large flows of funds every day and store highly sensitive user information - such as payment details - they require a high level of information security and decent protection from data leaks.  Hashtoro seriously approached the issue of security, offering a high-level digital and physical security.  The mined coins are stored safely on a cold offline purse. All the user information is protected by 256-bit encryption. Hashtoro’s data storage is PCI-DSS-certified, which means that it meets the highest standards of payment industry security.

Bloomberg notes that Eternal Blue was allegedly stolen from the NSA in 2017 by a hacking group called the Shadow Brokers.Hackers have since been using the tool in order to gain access to computers in order to covertly mine for cryptocurrency, with detections up 459 percent this year, according to the report from the Cyber Threat Alliance (CTA).“Combined threat intelligence from CTA members show that this rapid growth shows no signs of slowing down, even with recent decreases in cryptocurrency value,” the company writes in a preface to its most recent report, stating:“Because this threat is relatively new, many people do not understand it, its potential significance, or what to do about it.”  Cointelegraph has often reported on the emergence of crypto mining malware infecting user devices such as PCs and smartphones. Rather than Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH), it is privacy-focused altcoins such as Monero which are hackers’ preferred target, the report notes.The uptick, CTA says, comes as such operations are becoming more “sophisticated.”“Analysts have observed successful and widespread attackers ‘living off the land,’ or employing legitimate functionality to download and execute miners that would be more difficult for an observer or antivirus to detect,” the preface continues, highlighting the Monero mining campaign Smominru as an example.The NSA did not respond to Bloomberg’s request for comment on the findings upon publication."

When it comes to policy making, I think we need to be slow and deliberate and well informed.""The Chairman also rebutted accusations that the U.S. regulatory context for crypto has been slow to take clear shape, noting that the CFTC had presided over the “very first” regulated offerings of Bitcoin (BTC) futures, which launched on December 2017 on the stalwart American CME and CBOE exchanges.The question of how cryptocurrencies should be defined and which agencies are responsible for their regulation have long been debated by U.S. regulators. A U.S. House hearing earlier this summer encapsulated the unique challenge posed by crypto, with speakers emphasizing that digital assets complicate the hard and fast distinctions of existing regulatory frameworks.This year two federal judges have ruled on major cases that confirmed the applicability of federal commodity regulations to Bitcoin under the CFTC’s oversight, as well as – just this week – the applicability of U.S. securities laws for prosecuting crypto fraud allegations."

Cash, Litecoin, Dash, ETC and Dogecoin, supported by Infinito Wallet.","Sep 27, 2018","The company behind a multi-asset, universal wallet that can store major crypto and smart contract tokens in one place says it has become the first mobile wallet to support the ADA cryptocurrency.","Infinito Wallet says the milestone coincides with an update to version 1.15.0 of its platform – enabling users to “securely send, receive and check transaction history of ADA.”According to the company, this development is significant because very few wallets on the market support ADA, and there is no such app for mobile devices. Infinito developers have worked with the development team behind Cardano and IOHK, and they utilized their official Cardano Rust project to seamlessly integrate ADA-support into the Infinito Wallet. With IOHK’s permission and support, Infinito has contributed code to the open-source Cardano Rust project for ADA mobile wallet integration and will continue such support for the Cardano open-source community.Although there is a desktop wallet exclusive to ADA called Daedalus, Infinito Wallet says people who hold this cryptocurrency deserve a mobile-driven, “ultra-lightweight and portable” alternative, which would maintain the utmost stability and security. Furthermore, on its roadmap, the Universal Wallet plans to support unique features of the Cardano blockchain, including staking Ouroboros.ADA now joins thousands of other tokens on the biggest smart contract platforms — such as ETH, EOS, NEO — together with leading coins, including Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Dash, ETC and Dogecoin, supported by Infinito Wallet.Infinito Wallet describes the ADA cryptocurrency, which is based on the third-generation Cardano blockchain, as “digital cash that represents the future of money.” It is hoped the technology will pave the way for fast, direct and secure transfers — and in time, Cardano plans to “tackle numerous problems facing the crypto industry” through a smart contract platform for the financial applications that consumers, businesses and governments can rely on.The company says it has gone through a third-party security audit, and now users have full access to their private keys. Through the Infinito Wallet app, which is available on Apple’s App Store for iOS devices and Google Play for Android smartphones and tablets, users can check their ADA balance through the dashboard, send the cryptocurrency to any address and review their transaction history. It is also possible to receive ADA by sharing a public address or through a unique QR code that has been integrated into the app.The company says it plans to launch version 2.0 of its universal wallet in the fourth quarter of this year, and this will be equipped with a new design that offers a higher degree of customization and an enhanced experience for Infinito Wallet’s user base. Other features are going to include “full support” for blockchain mainnets, including Ontology and more.Infinito Wallet will also be launching various reward campaigns, including free token Airdrops and Referral programs in Q4, to offer more incentives to users.The universal wallet is available in a plethora of languages — including English, Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, Korean and Russian — and announcements through its official Telegram groups are also available in four languages.In a nod to its mobile-driven approach, Infinito Wallet supports Touch ID to provide “easy and fast app access without sacrificing security.” Additionally, its apps allow users to store a list of the addresses that they send and receive money from the most, with a view to pave the way for “hassle-free transactions.”Unlike other wallets, the company says it allows users to include messages with their transactions — making it easier to maintain their records. This is coupled with an ability to export an account’s entire transaction history via .csv files and emails.In the future, users will be able to see the fiat value of their portfolio and how it has changed over the past 24 hours, in real time.Infinito Wallet launched toward the end of 2017 — it has been downloaded by more than 250,000 users and has received positive reviews by the community. The brand is the brainchild of Infinity Blockchain Labs Europe, which hopes that its universal wallet will “serve as a gateway for users to maximize usage and potential of their cryptocurrencies.”Disclaimer.

This partnership will allow Binance and MSX to host traditional financial assets on blockchain technology through security tokens.”The chairman of the Malta Stock Exchange, Joe Portelli, has for his part said the initiative represents a “new market opportunity [to] develop and push the boundaries of the Maltese financial sector.”As Cointelegraph has reported, Binance first announced the opening of its office in Malta at the end of March after receiving a warning letter from Japanese financial authorities about its unregistered status.Earlier this summer, CZ told Cointelegraph in an exclusive interview that the exchange had opened a bank account on the island, paving the way for the introduction of fiat-crypto pairs. Company representatives subsequently hinted at the exchange’s plans to open a Malta-based platform to this end.    Binance is currently the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by 24-hour adjusted trading volume, seeing almost $822 million in trades on the day to press time.

include a decision-making process as part of the rules of a blockchain.","Sep 20, 2018","Since Bitcoin’s introduction in 2009, there have been several attempts to include a decision-making process as part of the rules of a blockchain. This is called on-chain governance, a formalized way in which a group of people can make changes by voting through the protocol.","The purpose behind it is to provide a clear-cut path to consensus. What are some examples of people using on-chain governance? It can include — but is not limited to — the following three topics:Cointelegraph interviewed several cryptocurrency projects — such as Decred (DCR), Dash (DASH), Bitshares (BTS) and Steemit (STEEM) — to see how they address the various facets of blockchain protocols regarding on-chain governance.As can be seen from the chart above, three of the four projects use some variation of proof-of-stake (PoS). In this system, rather than people racing to solve a puzzle the fastest, the right to submit a block to the blockchain is deterministically chosen through an algorithm. One factor that can increase the frequency of being chosen is the number of coins a person owns. The more coins they have, the more frequent they will be given the opportunity to submit a block and earn block rewards.Bitshares and Steem both use a version of this called delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS). In this system, coin owners delegate their votes to others, who then vote on their behalf: called Proxies on Bitshares and Witnesses on Steemit. However, Steem is different from Bitshares in that STEEM owners can only vote for Witnesses. Bitshares, on the other hand, gives the option to vote on Proxies as well as other areas of governance, which will be expanded upon below.Decred has a hybrid proof-of-stake/proof-of-work (PoW) mechanism. In this system, miners create blocks, but DCR owners vote on which blocks are valid.Dash also uses what some might consider a hybrid mechanism, except they integrate proof-of-service with proof-of-work for their Master Nodes. In order to become a Master Node, one must own 1,000 DASH. Once this requirement is met, one is then allowed to mine the blockchain through traditional means of proof-of-work.With on-chain governance, voters exist to help make decisions. All of these projects start with coin owners as voters. But as they move up the hierarchy of governance, the votes get distributed differently.In Dash, people vote by becoming a Master Node. As a Master Node, they can vote on various budget proposals. The budget to fund these proposals is drawn from 10 percent of DASH’s block rewards.STEEM owners only get to vote for Witnesses. These Witnesses get to vote on changes in consensus rules. However, STEEM owners also have the option of “unvoting” Witnesses at any time, for any reason — for example, if they don’t agree with the protocol upgrade the Witness chooses to back.In Bitshares, BTS owners get to vote on several things: block producers, Proxies, committee members who manage a few blockchain parameters and have control over required transaction fees, and funding the development of future BitShares Improvement Protocols (BSIPs).Finally, DCR owners perhaps have the most power in the governance systems listed above. As Jonathan Zeppettini, international operations lead for Decred, told Cointelegraph:“Decred is quite different, as we have taken the approach of putting ultimate sovereignty over the network in the hands of the people who actually own the coins.“They vote on determining valid blocks to protocol upgrades. They also get 30 percent of the block reward — which incentivizes them to vote — as well as distribution of Decred’s subsidies, which is drawn from 10 percent of the block rewards.Blockchains need block creators to extend the ledger. Block creators for Dash and Decred are their proof-of-work miners. Block creators for Steemit are Witnesses, of which only 21 can ever exist. Block creators for Bitshares are voted on and are called block producers.However, one interesting fact about Bitshares is that the number of block producers can fluctuate depending on what BTS owners vote for. As Dr.-Ing. Fabian Schuh, a committee member on the BitShares blockchain, noted to Cointelegraph:“[Block producers] come with a flexible size that is determined by the voters. If a voters prefers 25 block producers over 32, this can be published on-chain.”Probably one of the most dangerous events a blockchain can go through is a hard fork to change their rules of consensus. Decred provides a unique way to upgrade their network through their governance system. First, the Decred development team hardcodes the changes into the protocol, yet stipulate they only become active once a super majority of 75 percent is met. DCR owners then go through a round of voting. If the 75 percent threshold is met or surpassed, the new protocols are implemented.In Bitshares, BTS owners vote to fund the writing of BitShare Improvement Protocols (BSIPs). Once there is a majority, the motion passes, funds get released and the proposal gets written and implemented.Steem removes protocol upgrades one step away from STEEM owners. As Andrew Levine, content director of Steemit Inc., clarified to Cointelegraph:“Only Witnesses get to vote on protocol proposals and 17 out of 21 must be met in order for the proposal to go through. But witnesses are elected by anyone with vest STEEM (Steem Power).”Finally, Dash actually doesn’t use their governance structure to implement protocol upgrades. As Ryan Taylor, CEO of Dash Core, explained to Cointelegraph:“In general, the system is not used to decide protocol-level rule changes. We feel these technical decisions are best left to experts. Instead, the system may be better described in terms of ‘delegated authority’ in the sense that it primarily authorizes funding for individuals and companies to perform tasks described in each proposal. This stops short of telling the funded entity exactly how to achieve their stated objectives. Dash Core Group, which develops the Dash protocol, produces the reference software for the network, including the protocol changes.”However, there have been rare occasions where the voting system has been used. For example, in 2016, the network voted to increase the block size limit from 1MB to 2MB. Consensus was achieved, was coded by Dash Core engineers and implemented later, once they determined a safe way to do so.On-chain governance is not a simple problem to solve and any solution must consider several factors. For example, a blockchain system can’t necessarily rely on people to vote without any incentive. So, how might they properly encourage voting? Or, how can a secure blockchain be ensured with governance that won’t be exploited? In regard to voting, how much power should be given to coin owners? Should they to be delegated? And how much influence in the network should delegates have?Each of the aforementioned projects tackled these issues in different ways. For example, Decred incentivized voting through 30 percent DCR block rewards. Dash combined voting with mining by creating a high threshold (1,000 DASH) to be met before the becoming a Master Node. Dash’s governance model is also quite removed from protocol upgrades under the philosophy that experts should be the ones to make the decisions. Steem and Bitshares allowed delegation of votes, yet the former restricts it only to delegates while the latter allows voting in other areas.But perhaps the most fascinating theme between three out of the four projects was the idea of subsidies taken from block rewards and how their on-chain governance was used to distribute these funds. Decred’s subsidies consisted of 10 percent of the block rewards, which DCR owners can vote on how to use. Dash’s subsidies also consist of 10 percent of the block rewards which Master Nodes vote on how to spend. Bitshares has a ‘reserve pool’ of BTS that has yet to be distributed. BTS owners and BTS Proxies draw from this reserve pool when funding BSIPs. Written by Ecurrencyhodler, author of “Understanding Litecoin”"

The impact has been highly recognized by the community.”Nonetheless, the bank recognizes that several challenges remain, notably the prevalence of offshore exchanges that are used by investors to circumvent the mainland ban.The PBoC notes that the Office for Special Remediation of Internet Financial Risks has now adopted a series of targeted measures, including blocking up to 124 IP address suspected of providing a gateway to domestic crypto traders.  It further points to redoubled efforts to “clean-up” payment channels and strengthen monitoring and inspection mechanisms, noting that around 3,000 accounts have already been closed as a result of increased oversight. Lastly the notice outlines recent measures undertaken to counter the circulation of crypto “hype” materials.As previously reported, on August 25 the PBoC had already issued a fresh risk alert against “illegal” ICOs, warning that blockchain and the idea of “financial innovation” are being used to lure investors as a “gimmick” that conceals essentially fraudulent Ponzi schemes.This summer has seen an onslaught of toughened anti-crypto measures from Beijing, which have included a ban on commercial venues from hosting crypto-related events in certain districts.Alongside ‘offline’ measures, China’s tech titans – Chinese ‘Google’ Baidu, Alipay’s Alibaba and WeChat-developer Tencent – have all tightened their monitoring and acted to ban accounts suspected of engaging in or propagating crypto and even blockchain related activities."

Multiple scam accounts on Twitter have tried to pose as Litecoin founder Charlie Lee, as Cointelegraph reported January 2018, while others still impersonated the CEO and founder of Telegram Pavel Durov.In September, CEO of Twitter Jack Dorsey suggested that Twitter might use blockchain technology to combat misinformation and scams on its platform.Despite Jackson Palmer receiving a name-drop from the founder of Tesla and SpaceX, Dogecoin’s price and capitalisation have remained pretty much the same over the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data.

Bitcoin (BTC) into the purportedly untraceable cryptocurrency Monero.","Oct 2, 2018","Cryptocurrency exchange ShapeShift has refuted a recent Wall Street Journal report that $9 million in ill-gotten funds went through the exchange, according to an announcement published October 1.","On September 28, WSJ released an article dubbed “How Dirty Money Disappears Into the Black Hole of Cryptocurrency,” alleging that $88.6 million in fraudulently obtained funds had been funnelled through 46 crypto exchanges, wherein $9 million was laundered through ShapeShift. To analyze ShapeShift transactions, WSJ reportedly downloaded and stored a list of the 50 latest transactions every 15 seconds, at the exchange’s website.In the blog post, ShapeShift’s founder and CEO Erik Voorhees confirms that the exchange team had worked with WSJ journalists for five months, but “under false pretenses” as information provided by the exchange was reportedly misrepresented or omitted.In its article, WSJ states that bad actors took advantage of ShapeShift’s user anonymity, converting Bitcoin (BTC) into the purportedly untraceable cryptocurrency Monero. Voorhees parried accusations, stating that the exchange has an internal anti-money laundering (AML) program that deploys “blockchain forensics that are far more advanced than asking someone for their ‘name and address’.”Vorhees further states that WSJ “forewent a chance to prevent potential illicit activity” in their reporting practices. The blog post reads that WSJ withheld gathered data on suspicious accounts “in order to build their story.” In doing so, WSJ supposedly did not report suspicious activity to the appropriate exchanges, including ShaheShift, so they could immediately block the accounts.According to the exchange’s CEO, the claims made by WSJ are “factually inaccurate and deceptive,” and that WSJ authors did not have a sufficient understanding of blockchain and the way ShapeShift operates in particular. The blog post claims that WSJ reporters mistakenly read records of token transfers to such a degree that they wrongfully attributed $70,000 of “dirty money” to the exchange:“$600 of suspicious funds were sent to an exchange that wasn’t ShapeShift. Because ShapeShift happens to be a customer of this same exchange — 10 months later in a completely unrelated transaction — the exchange sent funds to ShapeShift. The authors didn’t understand how to properly read the blockchains transactions, so they assumed there was $70k in “dirty money” sent to ShapeShift.”Vorhees concludes the article by saying that “we are trying to pioneer a new financial system, and we don’t expect to be loved by the proponents of the old.” He states:“We will push forward, and we’d suggest the WSJ change their title to be more accurate and objective, ‘Less than two tenths of one percent of ShapeShift’s business might be illicit.’”"

The option of pausing, blocking, or reversing GUSD transfers is one of the basic technical principles of the new centralized stablecoin introduced by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, according to the white paper.The Gemini dollar white paper describes this feature along with other three main principles of the GUSD blockchain design, citing the need for the ability to manage token transfers in case of unforeseen circumstances:“[Gemini can] pause, block, or reverse token transfers in response to a security incident (i.e., catastrophic event).”  Specifically, the study’s authors review the smart contract of the Gemini dollar, implemented as an ERC20 token on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain, in order to demonstrate how to users can “independently” detect that feature.The research is based on the Gemini address that was found on both a Reddit thread and Bitcoin Talk, while the researchers claimed that nevertheless, there is still “no trustless ways to know” that this address is the only address of Gemini.As the study has found, Gemini’s custodian is able to generate an unlimited amount of Gemini USD, and it can completely alter the implementation every 48 hours, making the coins non-transferable. In conclusion, the study’s authors appeared to question such an custodian ability in regard to “truly decentralized and censorship-resistant monetary systems.”Following approval from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), the Winklevoss brothers launched the new centralized stablecoin Gemini dollar on Monday, September 10. The GUSD is backed by U.S. dollars that are “held at a bank located in the United States and eligible for FDIC ‘pass-through’ deposit insurance, subject to applicable limitations.”The Gemini dollar represents the first crypto-related asset from the Winklevoss twins, who previously received a second rejection from regulators to launch Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) in July."

The bank, which sources tell Bloomberg is no longer profitable, might sell for a price from $5 to $10 million, which is mostly formed by the value of its Puerto Rican license for international financial operations.Noble Bank officials declined to comment the matter to Bloomberg, while Tether and Bitfinex were not immediately available for the comments.Back in 2017, U.S.. bank Wells Fargo dropped Tether and Bitfinex — who share a CEO, Jan Ludovicus van der Velde — as clients, Bloomberg notes. The two entities had also reportedly received subpoenas from U.S. regulators on Dec. 6, 2017, with the impetus for them still unclear.Tether and Bitfinex were looking for other banks when Noble — one of the only two full-reserve banks in Puerto Rico that publicly operates with crypto assets — emerged as a possible option, according to a Bitmex report.While Tether had broken ties with their auditor in January 2018, an unofficial audit of Tether in June reported that the stablecoin has enough in dollar reserves to back its tokens. Bloomberg notes that Noble was audited by Puerto Rico’s bank regulator last year in a move that “raised concerns,” but that the bank has not been “faulted publicly.”As experts told Cointelegraph in early 2018, Puerto Rico was seen by many as a possible crypto paradise, as U.S. taxpayers were not obliged to include incomes from sources within Puerto Rico to in their tax declarations. However, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and local island authorities were expected to intervene in the situation in order to get ""billions"" from crypto taxation.In possible competition with Tether, three new stablecoins backed with the U.S. dollar launched this September. In the beginning of the month, Paxos and Gemini separately announced two stablecoins called the “Gemini dollar (GUSD)” and the “Paxos Standard (PAX),” both backed 1:1 with crypto.

Deloitte for instance, the biggest auditor out of the four with an annual revenue of around $43.2 billion, has stated that the blockchain sector is close to seeing a breakthrough with the technology.“Ultimately, [blockchain is] more of a business model enabler than a technology...for legacy organizations…we’re starting to see a change in approach toward blockchain. Executives in these organizations are moving away from the pure platform view of ‘What is it?...let’s find a use case’ toward development of more sensible, pragmatic business ecosystem disruption.”- Deloitte’s 2018 blockchain survey, published August 27In contrast, PwC, which has been directly involved in the cryptocurrency market through its investment in VeChain (VET) since May 4, a China-based Internet-of-Things (IoT) blockchain network, expressed its concerns over the uncertainty in blockchain regulation.PwC blockchain head Steve Davies explained that a large number of conglomerates and startups are exploring ways to integrate the blockchain at a commercial level. But, regardless of the increase in demand for the blockchain, regulatory hurdles in integrating the decentralized technology has limited companies from utilizing the blockchain to process information:“Businesses tell us that they don’t want to be left behind by blockchain, even if at this early stage of its development, concerns on trust and regulation remain. Blockchain by its very definition should engender trust. But in reality, companies confront trust issues at nearly every turn.”Generally, the Big Four have reaffirmed in recent reports that the interest in blockchain technology is rising rapidly, especially amongst high profile conglomerates such as Microsoft, IBM, JPMorgan, and Goldman Sachs.However, many experts including US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) commissioner Hester Peirce believe that over-regulation in an industry that is still at its infancy could limit a wide range of developments, ultimately damaging the growth of the crypto and blockchain space.During a speech delivered on September 12, commissioner Peirce said:“The Commission should not default to a demand that the crypto markets be subject to comprehensive government regulation as a precondition to allowing products linked to those markets to be traded in markets that we regulate.”While the Big Four acknowledge the lack of regulatory certainty in the space, the four conglomerates have made significant efforts in understanding the market to assist large corporations to integrate the emerging technology.Despite its concerns in regard to regulatory uncertainty in the market, PwC has been the most active professional services conglomerate in the crypto and blockchain space.Most recently, PwC announced that through a program called “Digital Accelerators Program,” more than 1,000 employees of the company will be trained in the area of blockchain and cryptocurrency.Over the next two years, Sarah McEneaney, digital talent leader at PwC and head of Digital Accelerators, stated that to meet the increasing demand for blockchain by its clients and competitors, the firm decided to engage in a major initiative to solidify its position at the forefront of blockchain development:“It just seems table stakes at this point that people should have more technology skills. It’s needed for us to remain competitive and to be responsive for what our clients are also going through...our clients are looking for us to do things more digitally and control the cost of what we’re doing.”As a professional services conglomerate, the core business model of PwC revolves around its auditing and consulting services that are provided to high profile corporations in major industries like finance, technology and manufacturing.Hence, in her statement, McEneaney acknowledged that a large portion of its client base that is composed of large-scale corporations have started to demonstrate big interest and demand for the technology.It is possible that PwC criticized the over-regulation of the blockchain space in its recently published study because its clients and large corporations in various industries are unable to integrate blockchain technology at a meaningful capacity to demonstrate the potential of the technology.Still, Pierre-Edouard Wahl, the head of blockchain digital services at PwC Switzerland, told Cointelegraph in an exclusive interview that the corporation is targeting the Swiss banking and finance sector with blockchain-based products.In July 2018, SIX, the main stock exchange of Switzerland, announced that it will launch a fully regulated cryptocurrency exchange by 2019. The public release of the finalized plan of SIX was met with optimism in the global cryptocurrency market, as it was the first announcement of a major stock exchange to be directly involved in the asset class. In the following month, ICE / NYSE, Starbucks, and Microsoft launched a regulated cryptocurrency trading platform Bakkt.According to McEneany, blockchain technology could negatively impact the current business model of major banks and financial institutions in the short-term, as it eliminates third-party service providers and mediators in the process of settling payments.In the long-term, however, McEneany stated that blockchain will enable banks, as institutions, to adopt the technology. This is similar to how Ripple has convinced banks like BBVA and Banco Santander to utilize the blockchain in processing cross-border payments, the technology may improve the existing solutions of banks.“I actually think it will be an enabler. Yes, it might hurt their existing business, but that is often the case with the new technologies: It’s either you adopt them and you think differently about how those technologies are going to actually offer new solutions — as well as improve the existing solutions — or then you just look at the improvements, and we are all racing to the bottom, because there are less and less margins for everyone.” PwC invested in VeChain, a major cryptocurrency with a market valuation of $711 million in May with the vision of utilizing the IoT-focused blockchain to enable the existing infrastructures of large-scale partner conglomerates of PwC.Raymund Chao, PwC Asia Pacific and Greater China Chairman, said at the time:“We are glad to establish a deeper relationship with VeChain, which aims to build a trusted and distributed business ecosystem to help address long-standing challenges in supply chain management, food trust and anti-counterfeiting areas. VeChain’s mission aligns with PwC’s purpose of solving important problems and building trust in society.”Since 2016, Deloitte has been fairly active in the blockchain and cryptocurrency space, leading various initiatives to promote the usage of blockchain technology.Two years ago, the auditor deployed one of the first Bitcoin ATMs in Toronto, Canada, to demonstrate the possibility of exchanging crypto-to-fiat with ease, without the necessity of strict Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) procedures.Since then, Deloitte has taken a comprehensive approach towards blockchain development and integration, by creating a division within the conglomerate called “Deloitte Blockchain Lab” that is wholly dedicated to blockchain research and development.Through its blockchain lab, Deloitte has worked with its partner companies to identify major obstacles firms face in adopting the technology and establish ways to leverage the technology to improve the existing infrastructure of corporations.PwC and Deloitte have offered contrasting reports on the current state of the blockchain space. On August 28, in a survey report entitled “2018 global blockchain survey Breaking blockchain open” Deloitte stated that blockchain technology is getting closer to a breakout moment. Meanwhile, in a study entitled “Regulatory uncertainty and trust are barriers to blockchain adoption amongst businesses” released on the same day on August 28, PwC noted that regulatory uncertainty still remains as a main obstacle in blockchain development.Deloitte identified scalability as the main problem of the blockchain, rather than regulatory uncertainty in the market, a viewpoint that has also been shared by different experts in the industry.Public blockchain networks need a lot of development work to handle the infrastructure of large conglomerates. Bitcoin is processing around 7 transactions per second while Ethereum has been doing around 20. In contrast, Uber processes 12 transactions/sec, Paypal settles hundreds of transactions/sec, Visa processes 24,000 transactions/sec and IoT networks process hundreds of thousands of transactions/sec.As such, in order for a major supply chain, distributor or an insurance company to adopt blockchain, it will have to process at least tens of thousands of transactions per second.“One major reason: As a means of processing transactions, blockchain-based systems are comparatively slow. Blockchain’s sluggish transaction speed is a major concern for enterprises that depend on high-performance legacy transaction processing systems. A lack of standards and interoperability between various blockchain platforms and solutions is another challenge.”- Deloitte study “Blockchain and the five vectors of progress”In contrast to PwC and Deloitte, EY has focused most its efforts on legitimizing the blockchain, by identifying risks in using blockchain-based platforms and crypto-related models, like initial coin offerings (ICO).In April 2018, the firm released EY Blockchain Analyzer, a technology “that is designed to facilitate EY audit teams in gathering an organization’s entire transaction data from multiple blockchain ledgers.”Similar to block explorers including Blockchain.info and Etherscan, EY Blockchain Analyzer is able to extract data from the blockchain to assist companies to audit various types of information processed on the network.Paul Brody, EY Global Innovation Blockchain Leader, stated that every large-scale conglomerate that attempts to integrate the blockchain as a main component of its infrastructure needs necessary tools to test blockchain-based smart contracts and business contracts, and without established auditing tools, it is difficult to convince corporations to adopt blockchain technology at a big scale:“Understanding exchanges and cryptocurrencies is the first step in our ability to develop tools to test various blockchain-based business contracts. These technologies lay the foundation for automated audit tests of blockchain assets, liabilities, equities and smart contracts. EY Blockchain Analyzer will be utilized by the auditor to analyze transactions on a blockchain and help provide insight to the finance function.”The company has also acknowledged developers and builders in the cryptocurrency market, by awarding entrepreneurs in the cryptocurrency sector with the EY Entrepreneur of the Year awards.Thus, in 2017, Bitcoin ATM manufacturer that deployed more than 180 cryptocurrency ATMs in the US were selected as the finalists by the EY Entrepreneur of the Year awards.In the months to come, EY is expected to continue its work as a risk identifier in the blockchain and cryptocurrency space, developing various tools to render the experience of using the blockchain seamless for companies.Most recently, EY started to analyze the public cryptocurrency exchange market, identifying risks involved in ICOs and the vulnerability of token sales to hacking attempts. Over the years, many ICOs lost funds in security breaches, the recent case happened in July, when KickICO lost more than $8 million in a hacking attack.KPMG also announced new leadership in its U.S. Blockchain initiatives to drive and expand the firm's blockchain strategy into tax, audit, advisory, and industries. In the months to come, the conglomerate emphasized that with the appointment of Arun Ghosh as the firm's U.S. Blockchain leader, and David Jarczyk and Erich Braun as the U.S. Blockchain Tax and Audit leaders, it will work with partner companies to create comprehensive blockchain strategies and guidance.The decision of KPMG to pivot its blockchain business to risk assessment and audit comes after the release of its report called “The Pulse of Fintech,” which revealed that the first half of 2018 has exceeded the total investment in blockchain technology made in 2017.Overall, all Big Four companies have recognized the growing demand for the blockchain and crypto. Interestingly, the four conglomerates are taking different approaches to facilitate the rapidly increasing interest in the blockchain space. PwC is taking a more aggressive approach to directly integrate the blockchain into existing infrastructures of conglomerates and Deloitte is focused on improving the technical aspects of the blockchain. In contrast, KPMG and EY have allocated most of their resources to analyze risk in implementing the technology and creating tools that can ease the process of using the blockchain.It is positive that conglomerates have identified regulatory and technical risks that come with the blockchain, which will help companies understand the potential of the blockchain in a more realistic manner. Still, as Deloitte and PwC firmly stated, it is important for major markets like the US and Japan to provide regulatory certainty in the development of blockchain technology to increase."

Since then, the lawmakers claim, “the IRS [has] continue[d] to expand its enforcement activities [but] without issuing any further guidance for taxpayers.The representatives deem that the IRS has had “more than adequate time” to work through complexities after its preliminary rules were issued four years ago. These indicated that crypto would be treated as property for tax purposes in the U.S., and were issued in March 2014.The lawmakers note that in September 2016, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration had reported that the IRS crypto tax strategy was incomplete, and had already called for updated guidance at the time, further noting that other associations have since called on the agency to provide additional clarity for taxpayers. However, the lawmakers consider that:“Despite the issuance of only preliminary guidance on this issue [back in March 2014], the IRS has made enforcement of this guidance a priority, undertaking robust enforcement actions on a number of fronts.”As an example of the IRS’ robust enforcement actions to date, the lawmakers draw attention to the agency’s decision to summon records from American users of crypto exchange and wallet service provider Coinbase in July 2017, which has since seen a protracted legal battle set in.The lawmakers argue that while the IRS has proactively continued to remind taxpayers of the penalties for non-compliance with its guidance, its failure to introduce a more robust taxation framework “severely hinders taxpayers' ability” to meet their obligations.The letter closes by stating that the representatives will be asking the Government Accountability Office to undertake an audit on the matter.As previously reported, data released ahead of the close of the preceding tax year suggested that just 0.04 percent of tax filers were reporting capital gains from crypto investments to the IRS."

(RMTN), by selling HempCoin, which he misrepresented as “the first minable coin backed by marketable securities.”  The regulator writes that Ayre’s claims are “fraudulent, positive statements about RMTN’s business and finances.”Furthermore, Ayre stated that HempCoin is a security backed by RMTN common stock, telling investors that each coin was equivalent to 0.10 shares. As a result, more than than 81 million HempCoin securities were mined in late 2017 and sold on crypto exchanges. As Ayre never attempted to register the coin, FINRA has decided to charge the RMTN head with the unlawful distribution of an unregistered security.In addition to the above, from January 2013 through October 2016, Ayre reportedly made false statements about the nature of RTMN’s business and the creation and “unlawful distribution” of HempCoin, as well as making misleading claims in RMTN’s financial statements.FINRA, which has started a formal proceeding against RMTN by filing a complaint, reminds the public in the statement that anyone named in a complaint can file a response and request a hearing.

Moreover, the press release explains:“When Paxos Standard tokens are in circulation, the corresponding dollars are held in reserve. Upon redemption for dollars, Paxos Standard tokens are immediately destroyed. Tokens are only in circulation when the corresponding dollars are in custody.”Paxos co-founder and CEO Charles Cascarilla says he believes the new asset “improves on the utility of money"" by fusing the stability and robust regulatory oversight of traditional fiat currencies with crypto’s promise to create frictionless flows of digital value.According to the press release, investors using the itBit exchange or OTC desk will be able to redeem their crypto holdings for Paxos Standard “instantaneously.” The stablecoin is reportedly seeking to be listed on other marketplaces, and will trade under the ticker symbol PAX.Today also saw the launch of the Winklevoss Twins’ own New York regulator-approved U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin, dubbed Gemini dollar.

called for an autonomous economy that operates independently from ...","Sep 12, 2018","As Cointelegraph reported on Sept. 10, with the approval of the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), Paxos and Gemini officially announced the introduction of two stablecoins called the “Gemini dollar (GUSD)” and the “Paxos Standard (PAX).” Both stablecoins are backed by the U.S. dollar on a 1:1 basis, with every unit of GUSD and PAX representing the value of one U.S. dollar.","Experts believe that the emergence of fully audited, legitimate and licensed stablecoins will have a profound impact on the crypto market, especially in the long-term, as it provides investors a way to retain value without being exposed to the volatility of the market.Cameron Winklevoss, the co-founder and president of United States-based regulated cryptocurrency exchange Gemini, said in an official statement that it has launched GUSD on the Ethereum blockchain network utilizing the ERC-20 token standard.Prior to the launch of GUSD and PAX, only two stablecoins — Tether (USDT) and TrueUSD (TUSD) — existed in the market, both of which have been integrated by major cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance, Bitfinex, OKEx, Huobi and HitBTC.Tether and TrueUSD deployed USDT and TUSD on the Omni and Ethereum blockchain networks, with TrueUSD relying on the reputable ERC-20 token contract of Ethereum.Brandon Arvanaghi, the core developer of GUSD, stated that the Gemini dollar is one of the first stablecoin, alongside PAX and TrueUSD, to be deployed on Ethereum as an ERC-20 token, with the entire system being integrated into the smart contracts of Ethereum.The compatibility of GUSD and PAX with the Ethereum blockchain allows for the transfer of the two stablecoins through the Ethereum network with the existing infrastructure designed for tokens. For instance, the Gemini dollar can be transferred on the Ethereum network through wallets like MetaMask and systems such as MyCrypto and MyEtherWallet, without relying on third-party service providers and exchanges.For usability and accessibility, it is advantageous to have stablecoins that can be seamlessly sent and received on an infrastructure that the vast majority of cryptocurrency users are already familiar with. The white paper of GUSD reads:“Gemini dollars are created at the time of withdrawal from the Gemini platform. Gemini customers may exchange U.S. dollars for Gemini dollars at a 1:1 exchange rate by initiating a withdrawal of Gemini dollars from their Gemini account to any Ethereum address they specify. The U.S. dollar amount of Gemini dollars is debited from a customer’s Gemini account balance at the time of withdrawal.”Charles Cascarilla, the co-founder and CEO of Paxos, emphasized that immutability and transparency in the structure of stablecoins is crucial for decentralized accounting. As PAX operates as a token on the Ethereum network, anyone on the Ethereum blockchain can verify and evaluate the smart contract of GUSD and PAX.""In the current marketplace, the biggest hindrances to digital asset adoption are trust and volatility. As a regulated trust with a 1:1 dollar-collateralized stablecoin, we believe we are offering an asset that improves on the utility of money.""In the early days of Bitcoin, many investors in the cryptocurrency market called for an autonomous economy that operates independently from the broader financial market and government-controlled markets.As the market started to grow and regulated financial institutions began to take interest in the market, the cryptocurrency market has become more intertwined with the global finance sector.In terms of value, cryptocurrencies generally make up a practical store of value due to their lack of correlation to the broader financial markets, as Bitwise Asset Management vice president of R&D Matt Hougan explained:“Non-correlation is not the same as inverse correlation, so there’s no guarantee that when the market goes down crypto will go up. Over the long term, we think the fundamental drivers of crypto are different from the fundamental driver of equities and other assets, and we would expect the low correlation to persist.”The lack of correlation between cryptocurrencies and the global market has been considered to be one of the strongest points of the asset class that may enable major cryptocurrencies to potentially find competition in the offshore banking market, given the increasing crackdown on overseas savings accounts by governments like China and the ability of cryptocurrencies to hold value in a secure and efficient manner.But, the integration of global finance into crypto finance through the adoption of fiat currency-backed cryptocurrencies, custodian solutions offered by banks and strict financial regulations will not lead to an increase in correlation of the value between cryptocurrencies and conventional assets.Rather, it will ease the process for institutional investors to commit to the cryptocurrency market and individual users, like merchants and casual users, to escape extreme volatility in the market to utilize decentralized financial networks.Erik Voorhees, the CEO of ShapeShift, noted that the integration of global finance into crypto finance is monumental and that it needs to continue for the asset class to survive and eventually compete against reserve currencies and traditional stores of value.“It's a big deal and an important step. Global finance is becoming further integrated with crypto finance. All that crypto needs in order to win is for this to continue.”Throughout 2018, Gemini and the Winklevoss twins have directed their efforts toward institutionalizing the cryptocurrency sector, enabling digital assets to be more favorable toward institutions and large-scale investors.The Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) proposal by the Winklevoss twins filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is well documented. To increase the probability of its approval, Gemini secured various partnerships with regulated financial institutions, including Nasdaq, to better monitor and oversee the cryptocurrency market.In July, the SEC ultimately rejected the Bitcoin ETF proposal of the Winklevoss twins filed by Bats BZX Exchange, Inc. (BZX), citing issues in its pricing model, saying that it will not allow ETFs to base the value of Bitcoin on a cryptocurrency exchange, which is vulnerable to manipulation:“Rather, the Commission is disapproving this proposed rule change because [...] BZX has not met its burden under the Exchange Act and the Commission’s Rules of Practice to demonstrate that its proposal is consistent with the requirements of the Exchange Act [...] in particular the requirement that its rules be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices.”Still, despite the rejection of the ETF, the partnership between Gemini and Nasdaq stands, and the disapproval of the ETF allowed other companies that have filed Bitcoin ETFs with the SEC to revise their filings accordingly, further increasing chances of approval.Since April of this year, Gemini has been working closely with Nasdaq to integrate market compliance and surveillance programs to appeal to regulators and to legitimize the cryptocurrency exchange market.The first step toward the institutionalization of a market is to create trusted custody solutions and appropriately regulate the spot market of the asset class to ensure stability and transparency.The efforts of Gemini and other financial institutions like ICE — the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) — and Nasdaq to evolve cryptocurrencies into a well-regulated, structured and transparent asset class are expected to have a large impact on the long-term growth of the industry. Tyler Winklevoss, the CEO of Gemini, said:“Since launch, Gemini has aggressively pursued comprehensive compliance and surveillance programs, which we believe betters our exchange and the cryptocurrency industry as a whole. Our deployment of Nasdaq’s SMARTS Market Surveillance will help ensure that Gemini is a rules-based marketplace for all market participants.”For nearly four years, since its launch in 2014, Tether has been the dominant force in the cryptocurrency exchange market as the most widely utilized stablecoin.However, many analysts and investors in the cryptocurrency space have heavily criticized Tether since its inception due to the lack of transparency and clarity on its origin, audit reports and structure.The controversy around Tether began in 2017, when a set of 13.4 million confidential electronic documents relating to offshore investments called the “Paradise Papers” were released by German reporters Frederik Obermaier and Bastian Obermayer.The Paradise Papers disclosed a connection between Tether and Bitfinex officials Philip Potter and Giancarlo Devasini, who established Tether Holdings Limited in 2014.Tether was brought into the cryptocurrency market by the integration of Bitfinex, one of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges in the global market. As the volume of Tether continued to increase and more investors started to rely on USDT to hedge the value of their holdings to U.S. dollars, major exchanges like OKEx, Huobi and Binance adopted USDT as the primary stablecoin.For many years, investors have publicly expressed their dissatisfaction in the opaque structure of Tether, as it became one of the core components of the cryptocurrency exchange market. Throughout this year, Tether consistently demonstrated a daily trading volume of over $3 billion, which is twice larger than that of Ethereum, the second most valuable cryptocurrency in the world.Hence, in a hypothetical situation in which Tether Holdings files for bankruptcy and the stablecoin does not represent several billion dollars — contrary to its balance sheet — then the entire global cryptocurrency market could suffer greatly.In response to criticisms, Tether Holdings released audit results in June through law firm Freeh Sporkin & Sullivan LLP, demonstrating that it has more than enough funds to cover the billions of dollars its balance sheet portrays. At the time, Tether CEO J.L. van der Velde said:“Despite speculation, we have consistently stated that Tether is backed by USD reserves at or exceeding the Tethers in circulation at a given moment, and we’re glad to have independent verification of this to answer some of the questions posed by the public.”However, the fact that the audit result was not published by a widely recognized accounting firm and that Tether canceled the audit from Friedman LLP led the controversy around the stablecoin to intensify.Speaking to Cointelegraph, American accountant and auditor Abhishek Shah said in March:“The reason given by Tether was certainly not clear and precise, neither acceptable. An audit is to be allowed as much time as required, albeit the audit needs to be concluded before the due date. It is not a reasonable ground, and I've personally not heard of such a reason in my auditing career.”For over four years, Tether has always been at the center of controversy and has struggled to definitively prove its legitimacy through trusted third-party audits. As such, investors such as Multicoin Capital partner Tushar Jain said that GUSD and PAX can be considered as improvements over Tether:“This is such a huge improvement over Tether. It reduces systemic risk in the whole crypto ecosystem. Tether is a systemic risk in that, if it explodes, billions of dollars could effectively disappear and cause exchange insolvencies. An alternative to Tether hugely reduces that risk.”In an op-ed published in The Guardian, Barry Eichengreen, professor of economics and political science at the University of California, Berkeley, firmly stated that he believes stablecoins do not solve the stability issue in the cryptocurrency sector.As an example, Eichengreen offered the dilemma of cryptocurrency-accepting merchants. He stated that merchants are not able to price goods based on Bitcoin, given the extreme volatility rate of the currency. But, stablecoins can be accepted by merchants as a primary currency because their value is backed by fiat currencies.“Stablecoins purport to solve these problems. Because their value is stable in terms of dollars or their equivalent, they are attractive as units of account and stores of value. They are not mere vehicles for financial speculation. But this doesn’t mean that they are viable.”Still, regardless of the stability in the value of stablecoins, Eichengreen said that stablecoins are still not viable for various reasons, with the main factor being the vulnerability of the market to tax evaders and criminals.“This exchange may be attractive to money launderers and tax evaders, but not to others. In other words, it is not obvious that the model will scale, or that governments will let it.”The approval of GUSD and PAX by NYDFS directly refutes the two arguments of Eichengreen. A distinguished government body — in this case, the state of New York — regulated and licensed the launch of the two stablecoins.Moreover, due to their compatibility with Ethereum as ERC-20 tokens, GUSD and PAX do not need to depend on an exchange. Even if they did, cryptocurrency exchanges are so heavily regulated in most major markets that it is highly impractical for criminals to attempt to utilize cryptocurrencies to launder money with stablecoins."

Blockchain Firm's DApp for Ads Now Available ...","Sep 27, 2018","The Chinese state-owned Bank of Communications (BoCom) has successfully issued $1.3 billion of residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) using blockchain technology, national securities outlet China Securities Times writes Wednesday, September 27.","BoCom — the fifth largest bank in China according to S&P Global recent stats — used an independently developed platform called Juicai Chain to issue 9.3 billion yuan worth of RMBS, which is approximately $1.3 billion.By using blockchain, all parties participating in the loan are able to track assets, manage cash flow, and perform other business operations. As China Securities Times writes, the use of blockchain will help reduce risks and also will shorten the RMBS issuance time, along with providing assets’ authenticity.According to major local newspaper Xinhua, Juicai Chain was launched by BoCom back in June. The first phase of issuing digital RMBS began in July, with the first due diligence conducted in August. The publication stated that the BoCom digital mortgage base will be available for intermediaries such as global consulting company PricewaterhouseCoopers, multinational law firm Zhonglun, and others.As Cointelegraph wrote back in July, China's fourth largest bank, the Agricultural Bank of China, issued its first loan worth $300,000 based on blockchain. Moreover, in September, China took a step closer to blockchain technology being accepted as an evidence for legal disputes.Decentralized solutions are actively being tested in the real estate industry. For instance, in September, the Russian branch of Raiffeisen Bank issued its first electronic mortgage, and the Netherlands state land registry expects to move all its records to blockchain within one to three years."

The index tracks the ten largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, currently representing 80 percent of the total crypto market capitalization.Per the announcement, any investor is now able to acquire the BIT10 token through the Abra app, with a $5 minimum investment. Hunter Horsley, the CEO at Bitwise, said:""Index investing is extremely popular in stocks, bonds, and crypto because it gives investors diversified exposure without having to constantly monitor news and try to predict which assets will be most valuable. So far in the crypto space, index investing has only been available to institutions and accredited investors.""The cost of each BIT10 token reflects the value of 10 coins in the index, while the token’s positions are reportedly held in multi-signature smart contracts on the Bitcoin (BTC) or Litecoin (LTC) blockchains. The press release further explains the operational principle:“Once invested, Abra and the user are entering into a smart contract that effectively pegs the asset invested (either fiat currency or cryptocurrency) to the same amount of BIT10 tokens. Abra will get a real-time price feed from Bitwise Asset Management and the BIT10 investor will see the market movement up or down reflected in the price of their BIT10 tokens.”Last month, Abra enabled the direct purchase and sale of cryptocurrencies for European bank accounts. Customers can now transfer euros or several other national currencies directly to their wallet which can, in turn, can be converted into the 28 cryptocurrencies supported by Abra.In March, Abra’s CEO Bill Barhydt forecasted that “all hell will break loose” in BTC and altcoin markets this year. Barhydt said that he talked with hedge funds, high networth individuals, and speculators, who saw a “huge” opportunity in the volatility in the crypto markets. “Once that happens, all hell will break loose. Once the floodgates are opened, they're opened,” Barhydt added."

out-of-pocket investment loss at Bitconnect totaled 150.28 Bitcoin 
(BTC), ...","Sep 22, 2018","Bitconnect, the now-defunct crypto lending and exchange platform that has been ousted as a ruinous Ponzi scheme, has memorably been compared by the Silver Miller law firm to the fleeting 2011 Broadway musical “Wonderland,” based on the dizzying impossibilities of Alice’s adventures in Lewis Carroll’s celebrated novel.","Silver Miller’s first class action complaint was filed on behalf of six defrauded Bitconnect investors in late January, just weeks after the Texas Securities Commissioner issued an emergency cease-and-desist order against Bitconnect for the selling of unlicensed securities.The complaint unconventionally opened with the following lyrics:“Welcome to Wonderland / Where everything you see / I mean from ‘A’ to ‘Z’ / Ain’t what it seems to be. / Welcome to Wonderland / Set phasers up to stun / Turn off the lights when done / Good luck and thanks a ton / Ciao, baby, gotta run!”In the ensuing months, the federal court for the Southern District of Florida has appointed two lead co-plaintiffs for the class action’s third amended complaint, who will represent all potential plaintiffs in the case. One of the lead plaintiffs, said to be domiciled in Dubai, alleges his out-of-pocket investment loss at Bitconnect totaled 150.28 Bitcoin (BTC), valued at the time at over $1.6 million.If the musical allusions have sadly disappeared from the most recent court documents, the number of potential plaintiffs looks set to burgeon. David Silver told Cointelegraph in an interview that the law firm “anticipate[s] thousands of people filing claims if and when this case gets certified and we hopefully recover assets to disperse.”According to Silver, plaintiffs were duped into taking the Wonderland-like impossibilities of the Bitconnect looking glass for “improbable possibles” and clung to the “sliver of a chance” that the high-yield investment scheme was legit. As cited in Silver Miller court documents, Bitconnect described itself as an “all-in-one” Bitcoin and crypto platform, where:“It is entirely possible to find the independence we all desire, in a community of like-minded, freedom-loving individuals who, like you, are seeking the possibility of income stability in a very unstable world.”This purported “income stability” amounted to the promise — regardless of the amount of the initial investment — of a one percent daily return, which Bitconnect alleged would be “generated by its own proprietary trading bot and volatility software.” According to this Wonderland algorithm, a $1,000 investment stood to return $50 million within three years of daily compounded interest, as the first Silver Miller complaint noted.  Bitconnect is alleged to have run a global Ponzi investment scheme as of late 2016 that enlisted multi-level affiliate marketers through a referral program that rewarded them for luring investors to purchase Bitconnect native tokens (BCC) on the Bitconnect BCC exchange, using either Bitcoin or fiat currency.These investors were solicited to participate in the so-called Bitconnect lending program, pitched as an “opportunity” for them to lend their BCCs back to Bitconnect, which the firm would then use its “trading bot” to generate “guaranteed” profits on their behalf, of the aforementioned astronomical proportions. Those who successfully solicited further investors were promised even higher returns.It further marketed a Bitconnect staking program, in which investors were given the offer to hold their BCCs in the platform’s Bitconnect-QT wallet as yet another means of pocketing hefty profits.While Silver Miller’s action represents the ongoing U.S. private litigation against the scheme — parallel to which federal muscle has also been working — recent developments in India have exposed a murky web of incidents that taint the highest echelons of the country’s political class.The case’s corporate defendant, Bitconnect, while hiding behind a shadowy U.K. address, has wreaked havoc through its army of recruiters that range from viral American Youtubers — resulting in Youtube’s own implication as a defendant in the Silver Miller class action — to shrewd promoters in the moneyed state of Gujarat, the home turf of India’s current prime minister.At the fulcrum of the Indian chapter is the city of Surat, known for its diamond moguls and textile export tycoons. Cointelegraph spoke to Kashif Raza of the Indian crypto litigation duo ‘Crypto Kanoon’ to investigate the scandal; an ever-thickening plot of alleged kidnappings and extortions, which has led to the arrest of a former lawmaker from India’s ruling party just this week.If Wonderland is known for the Queen of Heart’s imperious command to paint white roses red, in Modi’s post-demonetization of India, Google trends showed a startling spike in one particular search query that hoped for an equally dubious chromatic transformation: “how to convert black money into white money.”As part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s attempts to clamp down on tax evasion, in November 2016, he announced the government would be invalidating 500 and 1,000 rupee bills — which accounted for 86 percent of the currency in circulation at the time.“Black money” is a term used to describe undeclared income that escapes taxes, and Modi gave Indians until Dec. 30, 2016 to deposit their soon-to-be-defunct high-denomination notes, whose sum total was worth a staggering 15 trillion Indian rupee ($208 billion).The subsequent panic reportedly saw some 45 billion rupee ($650 million) flow in to Gujarat’s wealthy port city of Surat, to be hidden away in assets including cryptocurrencies, according to an accountant interviewed by Bloomberg last month, who asked to remain anonymous.This was the fertile soil in which Bitconnect’s India chapter took root. And over the course of the next year, as Bitcoin soared to all-time industry highs, so did the BCC token. But in January 2018, after receiving its first warnings from U.S. regulators, Bitconnect shuttered up shop, triggering a crash in the token, which plummeted from its Dec. 29, 2017 high of $437 to almost zero.The subsequent crimes and misdemeanours of livid Bitconnect investors are alleged to have taken place in February, although they first came to the public’s eye only in April.On Feb. 23, a Surat-based builder by the name of Shailesh Bhatt charged into the office of Gujarat state home minister Pradipsinh Jadeja and claimed that 10 Amreli-district cops had kidnapped and extorted him for 176 BTC, worth 9.45 crore* rupee (around $1.31 million).* A crore rupee denotes 10 million rupee and is equal to 100 lakh rupee in the Indian numbering system (1 lakh denotes 100,000 rupee)The band of 10 was alleged to have comprised not only rank-and-file constables, but to have included Superintendent (SP) Jagdish Patel, as well as local Crime Branch Inspector, Anant Patel.As a builder and “businessman” reportedly known to have a penchant for Bitcoin trading and other “business verticals,” Bhatt is said to have been among those who declared their hidden incomes under the Modi government’s Income Declaration Scheme (IDS) after demonetization.On Feb. 9, he alleged that state Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) officer Sunil Nair threatened him over the phone and summoned him to the Gandhinagar CBI office, where he was allegedly beaten in a ‘torture room’ and asked to pay 10 crore rupee ($1.38 million).Bhatt claimed he had been primed for the call by one of his business aides, Kirit Paladiya, who is alleged to have warned him that local authorities — supposedly both the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and the CBI — had him under close watch for his dealings in crypto. After his initial confinement by officer Nair, Bhatt is said to have argued his ransom down to 5 crore rupee ($693,450), which is said to have been paid via a so-called ‘hawala’ broker.Then, on Feb. 11, Bhatt claimed that Paladiya called him for a meeting in Gandhinagar, where they were both abducted by a band of cops in official government vehicles near a fuel station and whisked off to Keshav Farm House at Chiloda.There, Bhatt alleged, ""they beat me up inside a room and threatened to kill me in a fake encounter if I did not hand over my Bitcoins"":""Amreli SP Jagdish Patel and Amreli inspector Anant Patel were involved. I was forced to transfer 13 crore rupee [$1.8 million] in Bitcoins to Paladiya's account.""The plot thickened. For not only were the crème-de-la-crème of state police implicated, but Bhatt accused Paladiya himself of double-crossing him in cahoots with his influential uncle, a former Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) for the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Nalin Kotadiya:""I contacted Paladiya post-demonetization in 2016 to invest my money. He advised me to invest in Bitcoins and knew about my investment.""He further claimed that Kotadiya himself pressured him into paying the ransom. More on Kotadiya later.By April 9, the Gujarat’s elite Criminal Investigation Department (CID) had filed a First Information Report (FIR) against the 10 implicated cops, even though Director General of Police (DGP) CID Ashish Bhatia stated at the time that:“The FIR has been filed on the basis of evidence found by the team so far. In his application, Shailesh Bhatt had mentioned the transfer of 200 Bitcoins worth 12 crore rupee [$1.66 million] from the digital wallet of his business partner, Kirit Paladiya. Another 32 crore rupee [$4.4 million] were allegedly paid for their release from a farmhouse. Later, 78.5 lakh rupee [$108,872] were allegedly paid to get the Bitcoins back. All these transactions mentioned in the application could not be proven.”On July 20, the Indian Express covered a chargesheet which the Gujarat CID is said to have filed before a sessions court in Ahmedabad the previous day. The chargesheet outlined how the now-jailed and suspended SP Jagdish Patel had allegedly been in “constant” communication with his junior, Inspector Anant Patel, with the band of cops alleged to have received 1.32 crore rupee ($1.83 million) in booty from Paladiya following Bhatt’s abduction.As per the chargesheet, on Feb. 16, Anant is alleged to have given 9,087,575 rupee ($125,797) to SP Jagdish, who sent this money to his relative, one Bhavesh Jagdish Patel, a resident of Thaltej, Ahmedabad. The money is said to have been delivered by Anant and two local crime branch (LCB) cops in government vehicles. At Bhavesh’s house, the money was allegedly counted, with 1 lakh rupee ($1,387) deemed to be “missing”:“The money was counted again and 10,000 rupee [$139] was found to be missing. Bhavesh then called Jagdish and told him about it, to which Jagdish said, ‘No problem. You keep the bag that has 90 lakh rupee [$124,821].’”Then, when word broke of Bhatt’s Feb. 23 complaint at the Home Ministry, Jagdish is accused of contacting Anant and organizing for the booty to be moved from Bhavesh’s house to a friend, one Hardrik Mahida.“On March 6, Jagdish Patel was in Ahmedabad. At that time, accused Anant Patel was trying to cover up his crime and also demanding money for legal expenses for himself and other accused policemen. The then Amreli district Superintendent of Police gave 40 lakh rupee ($55,476) to Anant Patel to cover up his role and also policemen of his department […] [Jagdish handed over] 40 lakh rupee to Anant Patel and his staff Vijay Vadher, Sanjay Padmani and Pratap Der on April 6 at Pakwan cross roads, Ahmedabad. Jagdish’s presence has been captured in the CCTV footage.”The chargesheet, citing further CCTV footage as evidence, then accused the suspended SP of approaching Bhatt’s friend Dharmendrasinh Gohil’s house at Pachchai village in Bhavnagar to — euphemistically — “reach a compromise.”After this ploy allegedly failed, Jagish is said to have thrown “mobile instruments and SIM cards into the Sabarmati river” — the very devices that would have incriminated his scheming with the co-accused Anant and Ketan Patel.In parallel to emerging details of this quagmire of police corruption, the now-infamous extortion case made an about-turn when Bhatt himself was accused of an earlier — and even more explosive — extortion of a staggering 1.55 billion rupee ($215 million) worth of crypto and cash at gunpoint — including around 2,400 BTC — from two colleagues of a local Bitconnect promoter, Satish Kumbhani.  As CID’s Bhatia has reportedly stated, Kumbhani of Surat “floated” a company called Bitconnect and “lured people like Bhatt to invest for huge returns. Bhatt ended up investing 2 crore rupee ($277,380) in BitConnect [token]. However, its promoters shut shop in January 2018 and went underground.”In a press note, the CID is reported to have stated that Bhatt’s misdemeanours were uncovered when its sleuths went on the trail of how he had himself acquired the hefty sum of Bitcoin of which he claimed to have been robbed.The sleuths uncovered two earlier kidnappings — this time allegedly masterminded by Bhatt himself — involving nine accomplices, which included the builder’s nephew Nikunj Bhatt.In apparent vengeance against those responsible for the Bitconnect heist, Bhatt and nine others are said to have posed as local tax officers and kidnapped a small-time Bitconnect employee named Piyush Savaliya on Jan. 30. Savaliya is said to have been held hostage at gunpoint, also at a shadowy farmhouse — so apparently beloved by Gujarat’s criminal underworld — but this time one located in Surat.When Savaliya claimed he was unable to avail the men of their desired crypto, according to Bhatia:“[The next day, Feb. 1], Bhatt’s men kidnapped Dhaval Mavani at gunpoint [...] [who was] also attached with the bankrupt firm BitConnect. Bhatt’s accomplices forced Mavani to transfer 2,256 Bitcoins, worth 131 crore rupee [$18.2 million] into their account. The builder and his accomplices also transferred another 166 Bitcoins, worth 9.64 crore rupee [$1.34 million] into their account.”The CID’s press release reportedly added that Bhatt and his cohorts extorted a further 14.50 crore rupee ($2.01 million) in cash, which was secured through a local ‘angadia’ — an informal network of Gujarati couriers.Bhatt is reported to have distributed the spoils among his nine accomplices, keeping around 700 BTC for himself and allegedly asking his tech-savvy nephew, Nikunj, to make the transactions.When the sleuths tracked the beleaguered Savaliya down, he claimed Bhatt had paid him 34.50 lakh rupee ($47,848) to keep silent and to release a “false” statement denying the kidnappings. Mavani, for his part, was reportedly warned never to be sighted in Gujarat again: Police sources claim he has left the country.As the allegations against Bhatt’s shady past surfaced, the builder himself absconded. Speaking to local media outlet The Quint, the builder’s lawyer said:“The charges levied against him are false and part of a larger conspiracy. There is no Savaliya or Mavani; in fact, Mavani was not even in India when the alleged offence transpired. The police [are] fabricating the whole story about Savaliya getting 34 lakh rupee ($47,066) for staying mum.”  Nonetheless, both Nikunj Bhatt and a further alleged accomplice, Dilip Kanani, were arrested in May on charges of kidnapping and extortion, with CID reportedly recovering 152 Bitcoins worth 8.5 crore rupee ($1.18 million) from the duo.Another chargesheet floating around, which was also filed by the Gujarat CID in July, alleges that when the accused policeman themselves got wind of Bhatt’s earlier crimes, they themselves met on Feb. 15 at a hotel in Ankleshwar in Surat to conspire to silence him and prevent him from lodging his complaint at the Home Ministry.They are then said to have redoubled their efforts Feb. 21, when Inspector Patel, lawyer Ketan Patel, his brother Jatin Patel, Kirit Paladiya and an “independent witness” Vishal Sakadsariya are said to have met at yet another hotel to further scheme about ways in which to prevent Bhatt from coming forward.The chargesheet alleges that Ketan and Anant Patel attempted to trace the vanished Mavani — even sending four fellow cops to pursue him all the way to Mumbai — in what emerged as being a false trail.Mavani’s whereabouts are still unknown.At this point, you’d be forgiven for losing track of the countless names and double-crossed co-conspirators allegedly embroiled in the case. As Times of India jocularly reported, the CID detectives faced a similar headache and have reportedly created monikers for the different “protagonists” of the many-tentacled incident based on the “unique passwords of their Bitcoin e-wallets or phones”:“We identify Ketan Patel as “Loq,” and Shailesh Bhatt as “Choco,” a CID official is reported to have confessed.In Cointelegraph’s correspondence with Raza Kashif, he sketched out the political backdrop of the unfolding crypto scandal, with its tarnished cops, victims-alleged-perpetrators and even former BJP lawmakers accused of being behind-the-scenes puppeteers:“As we know, General elections are due to be held in India in April or May 2019 to constitute the 17th Lok Sabha. The opposition parties in India are leaving no stone unturned to corner BJP.“The Indian National Congress (INC, often called Congress party) has been trying to prove that ‘Demonetization’ was a tactical blunder and [the] Bhartiya Janta Party (BJP) took this step to make their own black money into white money.“The Bitconnect scam proved to be the icing on the cake for the opposition parties, as the name of the main protagonists is a former BJP MLA and he has been arrested by the Ahemdabad crime branch recently.”Kashif referred to the arrest of the aforementioned ex-Member for the Legislative Assembly for the BJP, Nalin Kotadiya, the uncle of Bhatt’s allegedly duplicitous former aide, Kirit Paladiya.Kotadiya was remanded in police custody just on Sept. 10.Let’s backtrack to the immediate aftermath, when Kotadiya was first tainted by Bhatt’s brush.In late April, after the allegations of extortion and conspiracy, with the disgraced band of rogue Amreli cops against him had surfaced, Kotadiya at first attempted to hit back, dismissing the claims as misinformation, with the bizarre defense that:“I am a man of public life. I meet people and talk to them on the phone. It does not mean I am involved in criminal acts with the people I meet or talk to on the phone.”Kotadiya more pointedly drew attention to the fact that the alleged BTC transfers remained to be proven, quipping that “if the Bitcoins were not transferred, the question that arises is where the money came from.” He claimed that SP Jagdish Patel was being “pressured” to implicate him in the case and even more explosively that:“Bhatt accepted that he was investing money from people affiliated with political parties. To protect them, attempts are being made to fix me in the case.”He then circulated a WhatsApp video, reposted on Youtube in late April, in which, attired in pink, he claimed he had duly informed authorities about the Bitcoin heist and attributed the full blame for the extortion scandal and conspiracy to Bhatt.As one alleged conspiratorial mastermind accused another of the selfsame, Kotadiya moreover threatened to leak evidence that would implicate even more local politicians in the scandal.By mid-May, despite Kotadiya’s protestations, his failure to turn himself in led a local Ahmedabad court to issue an arrest warrant against him. The CID’s plea reportedly alleged that the accused former-BJP figure had evaded the unit’s clutches:“There is material evidence substantiating the allegation of [crimes] against Kotadiya. It has also emerged from the record that though summons were issued twice, Kotadiya, despite promising cooperation, did not present himself before the investigating agency.”The CID plea alleged that in early May, Kotadiya had sent the agency a fax saying he would appear before them on May 12, but then failed to do so. On May 7, he was also reported to have released a press statement claiming he was being “framed by the conspirators.” But CID’s plea is said to have pressed on, stating that:“We have concrete evidence against Kotadiya. He is a politically influential person. His evading arrest could be could be an attempt to delay the investigation and create hindrances to it.”Meanwhile, May 4 saw the arrest of Kirit Paldiya, Bhatt’s accused former aide and Kotadiya’s nephew. His interrogation is reported to have revealed that Paladiya — in complicity with Kotadiya, the Amreli police SP and inspector, and lawyer Ketan Patel and his brother — had plotted to apportion the extorted Bitcoin spoils between them, allegedly reserving 15 percent to be split between Kotadiya, the lawyer, and his brother, and 15 percent to be split between the police officers.Kotadiya himself is alleged to have received 66 lakh rupee ($91,535) — of which Paladiya is said to have given 35 lakh rupee ($48,540) in total to two family members through a Surat-based angadia firm. 25 lakh rupee ($34,672) of this was said to have been recovered by CID officials at the time.As Kotadiya himself remained underground, by mid-June, an Ahmedabad sessions judge declared Kotadiya a ""proclaimed offender"" (absconder) under section 82 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC ) in response to an application by the CID and asked him to appear before the court within 30 days.Scathing news reports at the time pointed to Kotadiya’s political background, as well as characterizing him as a “leader” of the Patidar caste, a socio-economically prominent lineage within Gujarati society.Just last week, Kotadiya’s time was finally up.On Sept. 10, the Times of India reported that the ex-MLA for the BJP had been nabbed after four months in hiding. He was reportedly found “fast asleep” on the second floor of the under-construction railway quarters in Amalner, in Dhule, Maharashtra.He is alleged to have been hiding out there with laborers for the past two months, according to Deepan Bhadran, deputy commissioner of police for the Ahmedabad crime branch. The Times further claims that Kotadiya had eschewed using mobile phones to make sure he was off-grid, using relatives’ and other borrowed cars to travel between locations. A crime branch source is quoted as saying:“When we [eventually] found him, he was sleeping on a mattress and there was just an earthen pot of water in the room.”An Amreli-born contractor at the Amalner railway quarters is said to have first noticed him, giving the golden tip-off.As Raza Kashif noted, the BJP’s embroilment has been a political gold mine for the opposition party, the Indian National Congress (INC).In early July, senior congressional leader Shaktisinh Gohil alleged that the “mega Bitcoin scam” was being used to cover-up shifty conversions of black into white money by the members of the majority BJP party.As Kashif wrote in his correspondence with Cointelegraph, Gohil claimed that the Gujarat scam had emerged as involving “more than $726 million (5,000 crore rupee) [...] with some reports pegging the figure at $12.7 billion (88,000 crore rupee).”Gohil used the case for all the political mileage he could muster, demanding a Supreme Court-monitored investigation into the matter:“The finger of suspicion of this massive scam of illegal cryptocurrency directly points to several top Bharatiya Janata Party leaders and a mastermind — an absconding BJP leader and former MLA Nalin Kotadiya.”As the Deccan Herald bitingly put it, Gohil alleged that “extortion of crypto using government authorities at the behest of top BJP leaders in Gujarat has become a norm,” claiming that “political pressure” had muscled in on the local CID to hush the case up and launch the subsequent complaint against the Surat builder:“Instead of [Bhatt] being the complainant in the first case, the CID at the behest of MoS Home made the police the complainant […] Who are the top BJP leaders against whom Kotadiya has damning evidence? We demand an impartial Supreme Court-monitored judicial investigation.”Gohil’s allegations further claimed the Bitcoin had been widely used to carry out “illegal hawala transactions” post-demonetization, something he implied would not have surfaced were it not for the scandal first unearthed by Mr. Bhatt.As Kashif outlined in his correspondence, Gohil drew upon the full extent of the alleged Bitconnect scandal — which extends well beyond the web of alleged extortions and kidnappings we have mostly been tracing so far:“[News of the Bitconnect scam] transmitted a shockwave in the country at a time when the nation was already trying to recover from India’s biggest bank fraud case of $2 billion (over 13,000 crore rupee), a fraud [that had been] planned and executed by [diamantaire] Nirav Modi and his uncle Mehul Choksi. The Bitconnect fraud is six times bigger than the [aforementioned] bank fraud, which took all the headlines in the Indian media.”As the Times of India has reported, tracing the full extent of Bitconnect’s tentacles in India — by which we mean pointing to a figure less wildly obscure than Gohil’s benchmark bracket of anywhere between $726 million and $12.7 billion — brings a unique hurdle, in that many of its investors are accused of laundering their “black” cash into the scam post-demonetization.Even after Bitconnect scrammed late January — leaving its defrauded investors wallowing in now-worthless tokens — the CID’s Bhatia told the Times that the bureau has received few complaints, allegedly because so much black money is thought to have been siphoned into the the scheme.While the Times itself considers that the Bitconnect swindle may indeed have “siphoned off more money than Nirav [Modi‘s banking fraud],” Bhatia stressed:“So far, we have received complaints for cheating worth 1.14 crore rupee ($158,106).”So what of the Bitconnect promoters themselves? Has the protective cloak of black cash and the newsworthy distractions of lurid kidnappings and extortions really allowed them to get away scot-free?Last month, police finally arrested a suspect, Divyesh Darji, who is said to have held “held seminars [and] events in India and other countries” promoting the Wonderland promises of Bitconnect. Darji, a resident of Surat, had reportedly already been issued with a look-out circular and was arrested on Aug. 18 in the Delhi airport, after a tip-off from local immigration services.In his interview with Cointelegraph, Raza Kashif described Darji as a local and respected “influencer,” who enjoyed a number of high-profile and esteemed local connections, which he presumably made excellent use of to propagate the Bitconnect affair.Darji’s still-active LinkedIn profile claims — in somewhat shrill ALL CAPS — that:“I AM HAVING DEGREE OF M.COM. LL.B., B.ED., N.D. & HAD EXPERIENCE OF TEACHING +2 STUDENT & COLLEGE FOR 25 YEARS. I AM GOOD NET WORKER AND HAVING GOOD LEADERSHIP QUALITIES. RIGHT NOW I AM HAVING ENOUGH KNOWLEDGE ABOUT CRYPTO CURRENCY AND BITCOIN AND MAKING WEALTH THROUGH THAT [sic].”A recent Times article cites CID crime officials as alleging that Darji enjoyed “10 percent commission” on investments he brought in:“He was fluent in English and ran several social welfare programs. He had a big following and Khumbani hence roped him in […] Darji had brought investments of 4,100 crore rupee [around $567.6 million], while the total amount invested in Bitconnect could be around 41,000 crore rupee [around $5.6 billion].”As for Satish Kumbhani, he is reported to still be absconding. A senior CID crime officer is quoted by the Times as saying that the unit has “begun the process of getting a warrant issued against [him] and will then press for a red-corner notice (RCN)” to trace him:“Kumbhani was tracked down to South Korea some time ago, but by the time we could react, he had flown back to Dubai. He supposedly handled the worldwide operations of the company and may have possession of a large amount of money in Bitcoins, which belongs to investors.”Meanwhile, the U.S. states of Illinois and Arizona implored the CID last week to seize the property of the Gujarat Bitconnect promoters, the outcome of which remains to be seen.As Raza shrewdly noted, the INC has to date called four press conferences in response to the Bitconnect-related scandals, capitalizing on its potential to tarnish the BJP ahead of the forthcoming elections. In the wake of multiple high-profile scandals, he added that:“Back-to-back in the last five months, the magnitude of [a string of] frauds has come to 1 lakh crores rupee [around $13.87 billion]. For a developing country like India to face scams of this magnitude, [it] has shaken people’s confidence in the system.”Raza noted that news of the Bitconnect-related extortions broke after the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) notorious circular directing all banks to extract themselves from relationships with crypto exchanges and traders had already been issued on April 5.But Raza nonetheless stressed:“News like this makes life tougher for the average crypto trader in India […] the opposition party [INC] is opposing cryptocurrency now, because they have said that the ruling party used crypto to make their black money white. Now, if they come into power, they will not positively regulate crypto, because if the current party [BJP] goes into opposition, they will turn around and say that ‘once upon a time, you used to trash us for our involvement in crypto, and now you yourselves are regulating it!’ So this is not a good sign actually.”In his correspondence, he added that as they bide their time until the next date of hearings devoted to the RBI restrictions, India’s crypto exchanges and traders have found their “messiah” in the “form of the p2p model”:“Timely regulation will help curb these scams to mushroom in India. The main protagonists, in this case, took the advantage of ‘fear’ and ‘negativity’ surrounding this industry in India. Possession of ‘Bitcoin’ is not illegal in India and most of the exchanges in India are self-regulated and follow stricter norms on KYC than banks.“There is a huge challenge in India when you approach a police station to file a complaint against a Bitcoin fraud, as there is a high probability that you might be sent back without [them] even listening to your complaint. The fraudsters know this fact and they take maximum advantage of looting the general public in the name of high-return promises.”          As of press time, Shailesh’s Bhatt’s whereabouts remain unknown. With Kotadiya still remanded in custody, the case is poised to send further shockwaves through the crypto community and to provide further grist to the mill of India’s opposition politicians.As the final scores in Bitconnect’s Gujarat chapter remain to be settled, globally, the scandal has meanwhile bequeathed to us one of the most jarring memes in industry history. Here is a viral video of one Carlos Matos, a Bitconnect recruiter born in the Bronx who “serenaded” the audience at the platform’s first annual ceremony in back in 2017, in Pattay, Thailand.

#AML · #Money Laundering. Related News. Why IBM's Blockchain ...","Sep 11, 2018","The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) about the risks of adopting a cryptocurrency as a second legal tender, according to an official press release published on September 10.","In the report, the U.S.-based agency backed by the United Nations addresses the government of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, stating that the introduction of digital currency as an official form of legal tender will pose risks to the country’s financial integrity, as well as relationships with foreign banks.By adopting digital currency as a second official currency after the U.S. dollar, the Bank of Marshall Islands (BOMI) — the only local commercial bank of the country — will elevate the risk of losing “the last U.S. dollar correspondent banking relationship (CBR)” as a result of heightened diligence by banks in the U.S., the statement says.Since the Marshall Islands are “highly dependent on receiving and spending U.S. grants,” the IMF states that the loss of important banking relationships could harm the country’s economy.Moreover, the IMF believes that the costs of adopting cryptocurrency, such as the development and enforcement of anti-money laundering (AML) and counter financing of terrorism (CFT) policies, are “considerably smaller” than any potential financial gains:“The potential benefits from revenue gains appear considerably smaller than the potential costs arising from economic, reputational, AML/CFT, and governance risks. In the absence of adequate measures to mitigate them, the authorities should seriously reconsider the issuance of the digital currency as legal tender.”The IMF urged Marshalese authorities to reconsider issuing a digital currency until the government is able to provide and implement “strong policy frameworks” in regards to economic, reputational, AML/CFT, and governance risks.The Republic of the Marshall Islands — with a population of roughly 53,000 — first revealed plans to release its own cryptocurrency dubbed the Sovereign (SOV) in February 2018. As officials then claimed, the Sovereign currency would be “another step of manifesting [their] national liberty.” The Sovereign is set to be an alternative to the official currency of the U.S. dollar, and is planned to be distributed via Initial Coin Offering (ICO)."

cryptocurrency companies. #Bitcoin · #Switzerland · #Banks · #Startups ...","Sep 21, 2018","The Swiss Bankers Association (SBA) has issued basic guidelines for banks working with blockchain startups on Friday, September 21. As Reuters reports, the measure was taken to prevent a mass crypto exodus out of Switzerland.","The document states that banks see blockchain as an opportunity for Switzerland to house financial and technology startups despite ""risks,"" especially money laundering. Due to a significant increase of crypto-related companies based in the country, the SBA has decided to provide a road map for banks to open their corporate accounts.The guidelines divides blockchain companies into two large groups: those with and those without Initial Coin Offerings (ICO). Blockchain companies without ICOs should be treated like other small- and medium-sized companies, and will be obliged to accept relevant Swiss regulations and apply them to their business models.The second group includes blockchain startups with ICOs who issue tokens either in fiat or in crypto. Companies whose ICOs are funded via digital coins will have to comply with stricter rules and fall under the Swiss AML and KYC laws.The SBA guidelines will treat the acceptance of cryptocurrencies under ICOs as a “spot transaction.” As per the scheme provided by SBA, ICOs funded with fiat are placed under the same rules as blockchain companies with no ICOs.According to Reuters, the move comes amid a recent exodus of crypto-related startups who have failed to get access to the Swiss banking sector. As the news agency has learned, only a few of almost 250 local banks have allowed to assets raised via crypto to be stored.Moreover, two of them have withdrawn their services for blockchain-related companies. For instance, Zuercher Kantonalbank, the fourth largest Swiss bank, has closed more than 20 blockchain-related accounts, Reuters reported in July.Under these unstable conditions, the new guidelines might help to create a dialogue between banks and crypto startups more simple, according to SBA strategic adviser Adrian Schatzmann:“We believe [...] we’ll be able to establish a basis for discussion between banks and innovative startups [...] facilitating the opening of accounts.”Switzerland is home to dozens of crypto-related startups, situated mainly in the canton of Zug known as Crypto Valley. Based on Reuters data, the total number has now climbed up to 530 firms.As Cointelegraph reported earlier in June, Hypothekarbank Lenzburg has become the first bank in Switzerland to provide business accounts to blockchain and cryptocurrency companies."

Moreover, a lobby group has been formed with the goal of approaching the Russian government with suggestions on how to regulate crypto in the country.As an RBC correspondent has learned, an executive from an unnamed ""large"" Russian bank hsa proposed to create an alternative bill on digital assets which will be ""drastically different"" from the current one proposed by government.According to RBC’s report, the private round table has been organised by a lobby group which includes Russia’s largest bank Sberbank, Alfa-Bank, VTB, and others.The lobby group has also discussed regulatory issues with global experts, such as officials from a Japanese crypto exchange Bitflyer, Singapore-based blockchain platform NEM, and cryptocurrency Litecoin.

itself as “one of the oldest Bitcoin exchanges in the world.”.","Sep 13, 2018",An upcoming cryptocurrency exchange is aiming to become a leading player in Europe by 2020 — listing cryptocurrency altcoins as well as helping startups to get their Initial Coin Offerings off the ground.,"Blockchain.io says it will keep exhaustive accounting records that are regularly audited — and give peace of mind to customers by making extensive efforts to comply with the regulations in their jurisdiction, along with international laws. In the long run, it hopes this will help prevent scenarios where customers’ assets are seized or frozen by government officials.The exchange claims it offers “reliable infrastructure” that will be subject to minimal downtime for database migration, server maintenance or application upgrades, and says its system offers resilience at times of high volume, as well as during denial of service attacks (DDoS).Unlike rival platforms, the company says its exchange will be free of something known as “technical debt.” This is where a system becomes susceptible to bugs and security weaknesses because new features or altcoins have been added without proper testing, due diligence or careful software design — something tantamount to taking a shortcut.Currencies will only be listed on Blockchain.io once they have gone through a strict vetting process to ascertain their sustainability, with a team of experts performing a deep protocol review to help ensure they are technically sound.The exchange says at least 98 percent of its reserves is held in cold storage. Access to cold wallets require multiple signatures with the private key split across vaults in several locations — helping keep the funds highly secure.Blockchain.io plans to offer a large variety of trade order types to ensure that beginner and expert traders are catered for. Users would also benefit from a peer-to-peer lending feature, with the ability to borrow from a “centralized inventory of cryptocurrency funds” which is maintained and managed by Blockchain.io. All of these transactions would be subject to interest, with rates based on supply and demand.In its white paper, the company states its exchange will also offer “advanced cryptographic protocols” that “combine the best of centralized trading with decentralized settlement” — eliminating the privacy, scalability and cost issues that have affected the original Bitcoin blockchain.When it comes to ICOs, Blockchain.io aims to offer legal, marketing and financial expertise to assist with the planning and execution of campaigns. After vetting by the company’s team, these projects will be voted on and then approved by the exchange’s community.Blockchain.io says it will have strict criteria for eligible projects. As well as being legally compliant, the team behind an ICO must be experienced — and their idea needs to be of  high quality, viable and full of potential. Once these requirements have been fulfilled, the company will structure the entire operation on their behalf — and charge a fee for the funds that are raised during the token sale.Blockchain.io is being launched by Paymium.com — a company which describes itself as “one of the oldest Bitcoin exchanges in the world.”Paymium says more than 170,000 existing accounts will automatically be given a Blockchain.io account upon launch — and they will benefit from incentives should they decide to use the new crypto exchange.Blockchain.io’s public sale begins on Sept. 27, 2018. The Blockchain.io platform will be ready-to-trade for investors as soon as the token sale concludes in November.Disclaimer. Cointelegraph does not endorse any content or product on this page.

After choosing a collection category, users can invest in the entire category in one swoop.Today’s post outlines that the various crypto assets in each collection will be weighted according to their respective market caps. Circle’s Collections product will also provide educational content so that users can make informed choices about their investments.According to the app’s official website, Circle Invest supports a wide range of coins, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Litecoin (LTC), Zcash (ZEC), Monero (XMR), Stellar (XLM), and EOS (EOS). Today’s post indicates that of these, BTC, BCH, XLM and LTC will be included as part of the new ‘Payments’ collection.As previously reported, as of May this year, Circle Invest has been offering a feature called “Buy the Market,” which aims to make it easier for newbies to enter the crypto market. The feature allows users to invest in all Circle Invest’s listed coins at once, similarly splitting their investment – which can be as little as $1 –  according to the coins’ market capitalization weightings.Just last month, Circle Internet Financial Ltd. launched a U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin dubbed the “USD Coin,” which will reportedly be listed on Circle’s Poloniex exchange, as well as Huobi, OKCoin, KuCoin, and digital wallet and exchange Coinbase.A consortium called Centre – which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Circle, and includes Bitmain Technologies Ltd. among its members – is to act as a platform for deposits and fiat conversions for the new asset."

Crisis. Trustology CEO Says DeFi Will Become 'Predominant ...","Sep 28, 2018","Gold-based monetary system Kinesis aims to bring price stability to the world of cryptocurrency and to prevent the decrease of its value. The company says it has already attracted interest from key players in the gold industry, which is estimated at $6.8 trillion only on London’s gold market (70 percent of the global trading volume).","After the gold standard that once defined the value of currencies was abandoned in the 20th century, the monetary system became dependent on central banking policies. The Kinesis team decided to create its own “efficient, secure and fair monetary system” based on two of the most stable commodities in the world — gold and silver.“There is [approximately] $15 trillion in gold traded every year, creating exceptional but untapped potential for investment and exchange if gold can be remonetized. Adding a yield to this exchange multiplies this potential exponentially,” says Thomas Coughlin, CEO of Kinesis.Kinesis offers digital currencies based 1:1 on allocated physical gold (KAU coins) and silver (KAG coins). When users purchase Kinesis currencies, they actually purchase real metal. The ownership of the gold is digitized with blockchain technology, which allows the user to hold or transfer currency from their Kinesis e-Wallet. The Kinesis debit card allows the owner to make the instant conversion of KAU and KAG into fiat currency and spend cryptocurrency all around the world. The company states that, unlike other cryptocurrencies, the transactions through the Kinesis system will take just two to three seconds as a result of their bespoke fork of the Stellar network, which is able to withstand over 3,000 transactions per second. Kinesis believes KAU and KAG currencies could be used in day-to-day purchases  like buying a cup of coffee or even buying a car. Besides paying the bills, the Kinesis Monetary System can be used for managing international payments with lower transfer rates offered by banks and other international payment services.Another option offered by the network is the ability to trade holdings on the Kinesis Blockchain Exchange. The cryptocurrencies can be transferred back to physical gold or silver as the system generates a 0.45 percent fee when these are transferred between the holders, accumulating in a pool to be distributed back to users of the system in the form of a yield.Kinesis was founded by the Allocated Bullion Exchange (ABX), the world’s first electronic, institutional bullion exchange for physical precious metal. Which gave the new blockchain-based fintech company an exceptional start: extensive infrastructure and a fully operational exchange built for the trade and storage of physical bullion in seven locations around the world. The new — but experienced — startup is able to “bring back a truly decentralized, [digitized] stable asset, based on blockchain technology,” Kinesis says.Kinesis is currently in the public sale phase of their Initial Token Offering (ITO) of its Velocity Token (KVT), which will be the first cryptocurrency made available by the startup’s team. KVT is a utility token and is not backed by a physical asset but rather a whole monetary system.With KVT, investors can get a share of the transaction fees generated by the system (maximum 20 percent). This income is distributed to holders of 300,000 KVT, and company promises there will be no future dilution.According to Kinesis, there is a high demand of its first tokens. Kinesis says it raised over  $50 million just in their presale period by selling over 55,000 KVT.Disclaimer. Cointelegraph does not endorse any content or product on this page.

Unlike more specialized Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), GPUs are widely used in many domestic computers.As previously reported, when Zcash’s developers unrolled Equihash – the mining algorithm Zcash, as well as a number of other cryptocurrencies run on – they argued the ASIC-resistant algorithm would work to take transaction verifications out of the hands of a concentrated handful of miners.GMO has today said its new mining software client will be free to download, but that the firm will take a 2 percent cut on any mining profits to offset its development costs. GMO argues that at a “mainstream” individual level, software that enables “efficient calculation processing” is an important factor in successful mining.Cryptknocker is just one of many forays by GMO into the crypto space. The company already runs its own GMO Coin crypto exchange, a major mining operation and has even embraced paying a portion of its staff payslips in Bitcoin (BTC).As today’s news release notes, this summer GMO also unveiled next-generation ASIC chips based on highly-advanced 7nm semiconductor manufacturing technology, which the firm says are scheduled to ship as part of new mining machines by the end of October.This July, GMO launched a new internet banking business that will leverage blockchain as a central part of its technological arsenal, in partnership with GMO Financial Holdings and Aozora Bank.This March, GMO Coin pledged to improve its data security after local regulators identified shortcomings during a cross-industry probe that followed the high-profile $530 million hack of Japanese exchange Coincheck in January.Most recently, the company has announced it will be debuting its Bitcoin-based application for in-game rewards – dubbed “CryptoChips” – this August."

Source: Sina TechnologyAt the same time, alternative sources in China claimed investor dissatisfaction was linked to OKEx itself and alleged problems caused by reported system crashes.Cointelegraph’s own Chinese sources have since considered the latter version to be in fact correct, corroborating suspicions on social media that the WFEE connection is “fake news.”Cointelegraph reached out to OKEx with the findings, and the company also denied Xu had any equity involvement with WFEE.“Mr. Xu has no equity relationship with WFEE and its company,” COO Andy Cheung said, adding:“Though WFEE has acquired OKBC's [OK Blockchain Capital] and several other capitals' investment, the afterward changes of WFEE white paper and team members have not been given notice to OKBC.”OK Blockchain Capital also tweeted that Xu is not a shareholder of WFEE.In regards to the other allegations involving OKEx, local news outlet Jiemian reported that seven out of a total of three hundred investors who had allegedly “suffered heavy losses” on OKEx had reached a form of settlement with Xu already, a claim supported by Cointelegraph’s Chinese sources.In his interview today with Honeycomb Finance after being released from police questioning, Xu confirmed he had been held by Shanghai police, but robustly denied the allegations of fraud:“In Shanghai, someone reported that I was defrauding. I went to the police station to explain the situation and proved to the police that I did not swindle.”On Twitter, OKEx COO Cheung had stated September 12 that Xu experienced problems at a hotel, whereupon the police arrived and moved the parties involved to the police station, adding:“While Star was invited to help with the investigation and those people was detained, they raised a fraud complaint against Star. Star stayed to clarify and then left afterwards.”Xu added in his interview that it was “normal” for citizens to exercise their right to make such allegations, and that he had equally fulfilled his “duty” as a citizen by cooperating with the authorities.Xu gave particular attention to complaints of the losses incurred system crashes on OKEx, which were allegedly responsible for a total economic loss of “around 300 million yuan,” as Jiemian reported. As Bitcoin (BTC) tumbled September 5, OKEx platform failures are alleged to have left investors unable to close or otherwise salvage their positions, with losses all the more acute in the case of leveraged trades.In response to allegations of system “abnormalities,” Xu today responded:“I am not a legal person of OKEx, nor am I a shareholder or a director. OKEx is a Malta company, which is also very clear.”He further emphasized that while leveraged trading is a “neutral tool in itself,” it is “not suitable for ordinary investors” as the potential for accelerated net profits and losses requires “professional knowledge” to manage the risks involved.As Jiemian notes, while OKEx offers investors the opportunity to add as much as 20 times leverage to their contracts, unlike traditional futures trading platforms, the exchange operates without regulatory oversight."

A week later, federal officials decided to keep up with their regional colleagues with the national Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food sharing plans to apply blockchain technology in the forestry industry.With all this in sight, Spain remains a uniquely optimistic example of welcoming declarations toward crypto and adoption cases of blockchain. The country’s top bankers, politicians and civil servants rush unanimously into the possibilities DLT can provide.What would the Alastra constellation provide under the contract to the autonomous community of Aragon? The blockchainization of civil services. As Fernando Gimeno, the counsellor of Finance and Public Administration in the Aragonese government, stated that the technology will bring transparency and efficiency of the administration, which is important to attract business and investments.He further added that employees of the regional administration are already being trained to work with the technology in order to get acquainted with its ""enormous potential.” The signing of the contract is only the start of a series of activities scheduled by the Aragonese government to take place through the end of the year, such as training and consultancy sessions to identify more use cases for blockchain within the government.Neighboring Catalonia — also the autonomous community of northwestern Spain, but with a notable economic power and separatist tendencies — revealed a plan for blockchain tech implementation in its public administrative activity in July. The aim also lays in “improving digital services to the public and promoting the potential of this technology between the administration, companies and the [citizens].”According to the press release, Catalonia’s Department of Digital Policies must develop a plan for incorporating blockchain tech in all areas of the public administration’s activities by the end of December 2018. The success of this project is especially important for the newly elected Catalan government, as it wouldn’t want to miss a chance of ‘out-governing’ the rivaling Madrid.Alex Sicart Ramos, a Spanish tech wunderkind and member of Forbes ‘30 under 30’ list, imagined the vast area of blockchain implementation that could help Catalonia with its business DNA and cold conflict with the federal authority: For example, all citizen information could be encrypted and stored on the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) to avoid censorship and access control. The perfect way of accessing this information could be a digital ID card that will provide digital access to all of Catalan e-services (this kind of system is already implemented in Estonia).In April 2018, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria (BBVA), the second largest bank in Spain by assets and capitalization, became the first global bank to use blockchain technology throughout the entire process of issuing a 75 million euro ($87 million) loan.BBVA CEO Carlos Torres then said that blockchain technology was “not mature” and added that it could face major challenges in the future. However, in July, BBVA signed off on a new blockchain-based loan of 100 million euro ($117 million) for a civil engineering firm ACS Group. Prior to that, in June, the bank signed another blockchain-based agreement with Repsol, one of the world’s leading oil and gas industry companies, to renew a credit line worth 325 million euro ($377 million).In the latter case, the choice was hardly accidental — Repsol and BBVA have signed an agreement to develop blockchain-based solutions for corporate banking, using multiple different blockchain technologies, namely Hyperledger and the Ethereum test network. Nuria Ávalos, the head of Blockchain and Digital Experimentation at Repsol, welcomed the collaboration:“Repsol wants to actively take part in collaborative environments. Blockchain is a disruptive technology that is here to stay and the agreement with BBVA advances our strategy of driving digitization in all areas of our activity.”One of BBVA’s fiercest national competitors, Banco Santander, also isn’t a stranger to blockchain. Santander has become the first company to use the technology for investor voting. The bank partnered with United States electronic data processing services company Broadridge Financial Solutions to facilitate an investor ballot at its annual general meeting on March 23.Earlier in April, Santander confirmed the launch of its Ripple-powered blockchain payment network. One Pay FX, currently available on iTunes, is the first mobile application for international payments powered by blockchain technology. The app, now limited to transferring euros to eurozone countries and dollars to the U.S., shows remittance customers the total cost of their payment, including bank fees and foreign exchange rates, and a delivery time quote.But apparently this is only the beginning: In July, the company announced the creation of a blockchain research team to look into the technology’s potential to change securities trading. The Digital Investment Banking team, headed by current leader of Santander’s blockchain lab, John Whelan, will “[explore] the use of tokenized securities in debt capital markets, derivatives and other products.”Neither Banco Santander nor BBVA are collaborating with the banking consortium Niuron, but that in no way that makes the latter less influential. Formed in 2017, Niuron, as its official site states, is “the first blockchain consortium in Spanish financial sector.” The consortium includes Abanca, Bankia, Caixabank, Caixa Ontinyent, Ibercaja, Kutxabank, Liberbank, Unicaja Banco and Cecabank. According to a report based on assets and capitalization, Caixabank was Spain’s third largest bank in 2017. Ibercaja, Kutxabank and Abanca were also included in country’s top 10.The group of banks reportedly plans to create the blockchain platform by the end of 2018, with the goal of developing a blockchain technology-based system to identify and record clients when they open an account for the first time. Once the platform is completed, clients’ data will be shared between different banks and financial institutions. While ostensibly simplifying digital identification, it will also comply with recent EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) rules and modern security standards.Niuron believes that the new blockchain platform will improve the speed of operations, reduce fraud and prevent money laundering. The platform will reportedly benefit clients in that it will decrease the time required for the registration process and provide clients with more control over their personal data.On May 30, the Spanish Congress unanimously supported draft legislation that would favorably regulate blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies in the country. Due to the absence of a supervisory framework, the draft called for a review of regulations pertaining to Bitcoin and altcoins, as well as to blockchain, proposing to introduce the technology to the Spanish market through “controlled testing environments,” commonly referred to as regulatory sandboxes.As a result of the hearing, the Congress has also agreed to promote blockchain as a cost-efficient and disintermediated system for payments and transfers, which is no surprise given the recent pro-blockchain leanings in the country. The draft proposed the government cooperation with the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and the Bank of Spain to coordinate a common regulatory position regarding crypto in the broader European context.A month later, another bill — this time by the ruling Partido Popular — proposed to use blockchain in the public administration of Spain. It wasn’t the first crypto-friendly move by the center-right Partido Popular — a party that considered giving tax breaks to companies that use blockchain technology back in February 2018. Surprisingly, this interest in the adoption of distributed ledger technology (DLT) has been shared by the main opposition force as well: Left-wing political coalition Unidos Podemos called on the state to explore and implement the benefits of blockchain technology in August.Unidos Podemos has suggested that the Spanish government establish a subcommittee responsible for studying the potential of blockchain technology as well cryptocurrency regulation. Alberto Montero, the deputy of the political alliance, has reportedly registered the request in the lower house, along with a project plan.The blockchain-focused body would bring together public administrations, state authorities and public officials, as well as industry experts. The initiative aims to explore the ""enormous potential"" of blockchain tech in terms of reducing costs of government operations and boosting the level of security for social and economic transactions.The alliance has suggested addressing regulatory approaches for cryptocurrency use in Spain. According to the report, digital currencies such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and Litecoin (LTC) are currently “located in a gray area of ​​regulation."" The coalition also proposes to base policy on the outcomes of the EU Blockchain Observatory and Forum, launched by the European Commission in February 2018.This aligned multi-partisan hospitality toward blockchain may seem ironic given that the technology could play a vital role in the future eradication of the political corruption, still a whip of Spanish society, as recent scandals have shown. The EU Blockchain Observatory has already invested more than 80 million euro in various related projects. As a member of the European Blockchain Partnership, Spain is committed to building EU-wide blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) applications that can be used in the fight against corruption across the Digital Single Market for the benefit of the public and private sectors.   The more promising blockchain applications relate to the registration and tracking of transferred crypto-asset transactions. With the support of the European Regional Development Fund, a Spanish blockchain company is developing an Ethereum-based blockchain solution that will allow parties to legally/contractually transfer ownership of crypto assets by reducing the possibilities of manipulation and fraud, by adding verifiability and auditability to digital transactions and by tracking information and digitized assets without the need for intermediaries. The system will incorporate a public-key infrastructure — such as electronic time stamps and certified electronic delivery services — for such contracts.While the kind words in the blockchain’s address and the promises to keep up with the technical progress frequently occur in the political declarations still remain only words, various Spanish government bodies have decided not to wait for the final legislation and are already diving into the adoption.On July 26, the Spanish Society of Authors and Publishers (SGAE) and the Madrid School of Telecommunications Engineering (ETSIT-UPM) announced a research partnership into implementing blockchain for copyright management. The two institutions have reportedly signed a one-year agreement to carry out collaborative research into building a digital processing platform for copyright management that would use blockchain alongside big data, machine learning and AI. As SGAE President José Miguel Fernández Sastrón stated:""The main lines of research will focus on disruptive technologies that address the challenges posed by the volume, diversity and dynamics of change in the use of content in the contemporary digital environment.""The latest move came from the Spanish Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, which shared its plans to apply blockchain technology in the forestry industry. The aim of the operating group, entitled ChainWood, is to improve the traceability and efficiency of the wood supply in Spain by implementing blockchain technology in industry logistics.At the moment, the group consists of eight partners from different Spanish regions, including Galicia, the Community of Madrid, Andalusia, Castilla y León and Asturias. The first task is to develop a cloud-based software “that will improve the transparency” of forestry processes — like the creation of solid wood, disintegration, cellulose paste and biomass — by applying blockchain, big data and machine learning."

Schneiderman sent letters to thirteen crypto exchanges, requesting information on their operations, internal controls and other key issues.The move was taken in order to provide average investors with a better understanding of the risks and protections associated with cryptocurrency trading platforms, as well as increase transparency.The recent report examines the practices of ten crypto trading platforms based in the U.S. and abroad, as well data collected by the Attorney General’s office about the state of digital currency markets as a whole.The study found that the absence of accepted methods for auditing virtual assets results in the lack of a consistent and transparent approach to independently auditing digital currency traded on exchanges. This puts customers’ funds held on their exchange accounts at risk of attacks from hackers or theft. The report subsequently questions the issue of public protection and the sufficiency of the commercial insurance to cover possible losses.The report further outlines abusive trading practices, emphasizing that the majority of crypto trading platforms deploy automated traders, offering them special conditions, which leaves retail customers at a disadvantage. It also states that digital currency exchanges involve numerous, overlapping lines of business that represent serious conflicts of interest. The report explains:“Automated trading activities could also allow a single trader or group of traders to command multiple accounts simultaneously to obscure coordinated trading, in order to manipulate prices.”The report notes, that several of the investigated platforms trade their own account in volumes that make up a significant portion of total trading. Several allow their employees to trade on their venue, which raises doubts about exchanges’ efforts to ensure employees do not use non-public data to obtain an advantage over other traders. Some of the platforms issue their own digital currencies or accept compensation in exchange for listing a virtual asset to trade. The report further reads:“Though some virtual currency platforms have taken steps to police the fairness of their platforms and safeguard the integrity of their exchange, others have not. Platforms lack robust real-time and historical market surveillance capabilities, like those found in traditional trading venues, to identify and stop suspicious trading patterns.”"

Red Belly Blockchain was tested on 1,000 machines in 18 regions, including North and South Americas, Australia, and Europe.As per the CSIRO report, Red Belly Blockchain was reportedly able to operate 30,000 transactions per second from different locations, showing an average transaction delay of three seconds.Bitcoin (BTC) infrastructure normally scales up to eight transactions per second, according to Blockchain’s statistics for September. Ethereum (ETH) blockchain capability is up to 15 transactions per second; however, its creator Vitalik Buterin plans to scale it up to 500 using ZK-SNARK to mass-validate transactions.According to a report released by CSIRO back in July, Red Belly Blockchain uses byzantine consensus — an algorithm that completes transactions without proof-of-work (PoW) and thus without an increase in energy consumption.Dr Vincent Gramoli, senior researcher at CSIRO and head of the research group at the University of Sydney, noted that the current problems with “real-world applications of blockchain” include “issues with energy consumption and complexities induced by the proof of work.”According to the CSIRO release, this is not the first time that Red Belly Blockchain has been tested on Amazon Cloud. During experiments between July 2017 and May 2018, one test showed 660,000 transactions per second on 300 machines. However, all of them were in a single Availability Zone.Australia’s securities exchange, which has been working to implement blockchain as of December 2017 to replace its current system for processing equity transactions, said in September it would delay the transition for six months.More recently, Australian real estate firm Vicinity announced plans this week to trial a blockchain solution for its energy network in partnership with energy tech company Power Ledger."

Hedge funds need it, family offices need it, they can't participate in digital currency until they have a place to store it that's regulated.""As previously reported, the narrative that custody is one of the chief remaining obstacles for the crypto market to “mature” and draw institutional investment is widely shared. CNBC interviewed Monica Sommerville of consulting firm TABB Group, who noted that:""Institutional investors are very interested in finding a solution, but they haven't seen one that they think is perfect for various reasons. They still self-custody, and manage all their own keys.""Somerville added that she worked with one family office who reportedly stores clients’ crypto in “baby carrot”-sized crypto hardware wallets organized in binders until “a better alternative” is found.While individual retail investors have the relatively secure option of storing crypto themselves in offline cold storage, family offices and hedge funds are required by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to use a third-party regulated institution to safely store assets if they are worth over $150 million, as CNBC reports.Alongside BitGo, this year has seen major U.S. wallet and exchange service provider Coinbase as well as Japan’s Nomura Bank launch their own custody solutions.

The spreadsheet contained four tables with ""node mutual voting table"" and ""node income statement"" among them.As per Eosone, this could mean that main EOS nodes, including Chinese crypto exchange Huobi (the fourth BP in current producer ranking, according to EOS Titan), were involved in mutual voting along with pay-offs.The top 21 BPs in current EOS ranking, according to EOS Titan.

The Chinese crypto exchange might then use those votes at their discretion, Maple Leaf concluded.All listed allegations, if confirmed, could conflict with Article IV of the current EOS Constitution called “No Vote Buying”, which states the following:“No Member shall offer nor accept anything of value in exchange for a vote of any type, nor shall any Member unduly influence the vote of another.”Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin commented about the thread started by Maple Leaf Capital, saying the vote-trading was “completely predictable”:“Interesting! I mean, it was completely predictable and I did predict it,  but I did not expect it to happen so thoroughly and so soon!”Buterin also criticized the very system of EOS nodes:“As a followup, *this* is why I do not believe in coinholder-voted on-chain treasuries.

Pay-to-Play Gaming Is Flawed, Blockchain-Based Platform Says.","Oct 1, 2018","For small indie game developers, the advent of Apple’s App Store and Google Play has proven to be both a blessing and a curse.","While one-man bands were able to upstage some of the world’s largest game publishers initially – Flappy Bird, anyone? – established studios have started to catch up, with competition in the marketplace rife and high commission fees eating into already tight profit margins.However, a decentralized “crypto arcade playground” is hoping to help smaller creators survive and succeed by enabling them to target gamers through blockchain – giving them a chance to market and monetize their games while clamping down on piracy.PlayGame says developers on its platform keep 100 percent of their revenue, a far cry from so-called “Goliath” platforms that take up to 30 percent of earnings.Its system will allow any developer to introduce their very own token economy in the games they release – enabling them to reward regular players with coins and introduce pool prizes for tournaments and other multiplayer games.The company says it wants to benefit developers and their fans through two key building blocks. Firstly, it plans to launch PlayGame.com – a direct-to-play HTML5 gaming platform which aims to “simplify marketing and distribution.” Through this website, players will be able to access new games from their PCs or smartphones without needing to download an app.PlayGame is also going to tap into the growing appetite for crowdfunding through a custom-built platform known as the FunFund Initiative. It’s hoped this will enable developers to reach out to cryptocurrency holders who are looking to support indie developers.In its white paper, the startup says that it has a team of more than 20 industry experts driving the PlayGame website – all of whom share a vision of enabling entrepreneurs to “convert their game ideas into fully functional games that can be enjoyed by millions of people regardless of their location, origin, game devices or socioeconomic status.”Developers would be able to receive “fair” payments, while advertisers would benefit from “transparency” as the company claims the metrics used for gauging clicks and impressions through current mainstream platforms are “highly misleading.”PlayGame says the crypto world’s potential for gaming has already been proven through ventures such as CryptoKitties, where players are able to buy and sell rare collectibles. In particular, the startup is interested in targeting the Japanese market.The company’s CEO, Anton Soeharyo, founded TouchTen – which PlayGame describes as “one of the most successful mobile companies in Indonesia” after releasing more than 50 titles and amassing in excess of 50 million downloads. It claims one TouchTen product, Infinite Sky, made it into the top 10 downloads chart on Apple’s App Store in 43 territories.Between now and the end of the year, PlayGame is planning to further develop its platform – paving the way for its website to undergo a soft launch in the first half of 2019. Illustrating its business model, the company says that gamers would need to use PXG tokens in order to participate in time-limited events, such as a sudoku tournament. While 90 percent of these fees would be returned to players in payouts, the remaining 10 percent would be divided between developers and PlayGame on a ratio of 50/50.A total of 600 million PXG tokens are going up for sale – and a third of them were reserved for the pre-token sale which began back on Sept 10 and have sold out in 5 days. The full token sale, with the remaining 400 million tokens, began two weeks later on Sept 24. It is scheduled to conclude on Oct 22.Disclaimer.

His appointment comes as part of the fourth reshuffle of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzō Abe's cabinet.","Takuya Hirai, a member of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), and reportedly one of the architects of a law legalizing crypto exchanges in Japan last year, will take up the key role as head of the ministry — charged, among other things, with overseeing official government policy towards financial technologies.As CT Japan outlined, Hirai has been proactive in promoting blockchain as part of his role as chairperson of the Liberal Democratic Party's IT Strategy Special Committee, as well as chairperson of the Fintech Promotion Parliamentarians’ Federation.Moreover, Hirai is credited for his role in drafting Japan’s basic cybersecurity law, which was enacted in 2015; at the time, Hirai stated that the LDP “concluded that [the government] will, for now, avoid a move towards legal regulation” of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC).CT Japan further points to local Japanese media reports that have highlighted Hirai’s positive remarks regarding Initial Coin Offerings (ICO) at the JBA (Japan Blockchain Association) meeting this August; he has also advised the ICO Business Study Group at Tama University's Rule Formation Strategy Institute.In regards to progress in establishing futures rules “such as the creation of voluntary ICO regulations in the future,” CT Japan writes that “various support and efforts from the government are [to be] expected,” given the appointment of a figure that is well versed in crypto to the head post of the country’s Science, Technology, and IT Ministry.As previously reported, Hirai’s advisory role at Tama University saw the study group release a wide-ranging list of guidelines for the regulation and full legalization of ICOs in the country, which will reportedly be officially considered by Japan’s Financial Services Agency, and could eventually be passed into law in a few years’ time.The guidelines included rules for anti-money-laundering (AML), know-your-customer (KYC) measures, tracking project progress, and protecting existing equity and debt holders."

confusion between blockchain and cryptocurrencies — according to Orzan ...","Sep 24, 2018","If recent reports come to fruition, blockchain technology has the potential to have a massive financial impact on the global trade industry.","The World Economic Forum (WEF) released an optimistic outlook for the global economy, which would be driven by the impact and adoption of blockchain technology in the next 10 years.According to the organization, blockchain could bolster global trade to the tune of $1 trillion by 2028. The report, “Trade Tech – A New Age for Trade and Supply Chain Finance,” looked at the effect distributed ledger technology (DLT) could have on global trade finance.Much of the trade finance industry still relies on systems that are outdated — and it is being suggested that this sector could be overhauled by the implementation and use of blockchain systems.A major stumbling block in this system is the trade finance gap, as the sector is quite literally hampered by the lack of financial means to facilitate trade around the world.Bains and Company, which produced the report with the WEF, suggested that this trade finance gap could swell to $2.4 trillion by 2025, if the industry does not adapt. In the same breath, the consultancy says blockchain technology could be the answer to this problem:“A major impediment stands in the way of expanding trade and making it more efficient and safe: namely, paper-intensive, manual processes.”Using a pen to paper quite literally hampers the global trade industry, and a shift away from this slow and costly system is expected to save an enormous amount of time and money.Conventional trade requires a massive amount of paper, which is used to facilitate communication between customs brokers, freight forwarders, logistics providers and governmental agencies.As the WEF report states, a move to a digital processing system will put an end to processes that have been around for decades:“Paper-based, manual processes, some created centuries ago, lead to complexity and delays, introduce errors and risks, and stand in the way of reliable, real-time information gathering and tracking required for credible financing decisions.”It is not difficult to see how blockchain technology could streamline these processes for all the parties involved. With so many moving parts in global trade, it can be quite difficult to track and verify information, especially when information is being passed around on hard-copy waybills.This is where the benefits of distributed ledger technology comes to the fore. By allowing information to be securely shared to all participants of a network, all parties involved in a certain trade have access to real-time information of the process.Whether it’s at the preliminary stage of waiting for confirmation of finance or tracking the physical position of goods that are being traded, blockchain technology gives everyone with the necessary permission access to this data.Certified parties have the authority to initiate transactions through ‘smart contracts’ like those pioneered by the Ethereum protocol. In doing so, this rules out the need of a third party to verify that contractual conditions have been met.Furthermore, having one shared database for all users reduces the costs and time it takes to upkeep manual systems.It is encouraging to see that some companies have already made strides in using blockchain technology to streamline their processes.In May 2018, HSBC claimed to have completed the first trade finance deal using blockchain technology. This involved securing a letter of credit for the trade, which involved a shipment of soya beans from Argentina to Malaysia.In August, IBM, with shipping and logistics conglomerate Maersk, launched their global blockchain-enabled shipping solution.Called TradeLens, the platform tracks real-time data from any given shipment in a supply chain, providing information to the shared ledger. The project is said to be able to reduce the transit time of a shipment of materials to a production line by 40 percent in the United States.Walmart also partnered up with IBM, announcing in June their plans to release a blockchain-powered system for tracking food globally through its supply chain. The driving force behind this platform is to allow the company to address food recall issues — which could help identify outbreaks to reduce the risk of consumers being harmed.As recently as September, a new trade and finance blockchain platform, backed by the People's Bank of China, launched pilot operations for a blockchain-powered ecosystem for cross-border trading.If the WEF report is indeed correct, the global trade finance industry could well be overhauled by the use of blockchain-based platforms.Spiros Margaris, a venture capitalist, told Cointelegraph that the predictions made in the report are not overly ambitious.In fact, Margaris suggests that the impact could be much more substantial if blockchain technology continues to be developed:“I think that blockchain’s impact will be bigger than what the WEF estimated if we solve some of the current blockchain technical issues, which eventually I am certain we will. I like to refer to the quote by Bill Gates: ‘We always overestimate the change that will occur in the next two years and underestimate the change that will occur in the next 10. Don't let yourself be lulled into inaction.’”At the end of the day, it is inevitable that global trade systems will move away from archaic processes. Moving away from paper-based documentation is a major move in the right direction.Once that is done, leveraging blockchain technology to process and share data with relevant parties could well bring about the economic benefits laid out in this highly informative report.As Margaris explains, trustless systems have the power to cut out the middleman — or any central authority — and this could have potential benefits for the global trade and investment sectors and beyond:“I believe that blockchain’s greatest impact and influence in the future will be on the issue of ‘trust.’ It is the most important element of any deal or transaction. So blockchain’s greatest achievement will be that it will be easier for us to trust our counterparty or to be sure that the news are real or the election is not manipulated, just to mention a few cases.”Michele Orzan, digital leader (Europe) of the WEF, spoke to Cointelegraph about the ramifications this report could have in the years to come and the stance her organization is taking toward cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology.It is vastly encouraging to know that the WEF is trying to discourage ‘oppressive’ regulations toward crypto and blockchain. It’s been close to 10 years since Bitcoin was created and there is still confusion between blockchain and cryptocurrencies — according to Orzan:“Cryptos are today to the blockchain what email was to the internet in the ‘90s. The turmoil of speculative new entrants in the world of crypto last year contributed to this mess. Governments are made of officials who often represent the average population, with all its fears, whims, ideas and beliefs. That's why we see a confusing disarray of regulations regarding the industry and especially cryptocurrencies. There's clearly something wrong if some countries welcome and even launch cryptocurrencies while others prohibit them.”As Orzan suggests, both blockchain and cryptocurrency development will benefit from more measured legislation. He points to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) as a roleplayer that could drive this sort of guidance.While other organizations and governments could play an active role in driving adoption of these relatively new phenomena, it’s interesting to see what stance the WEF is taking toward driving investment in crypto and blockchain.The organization is taking a multistakeholder approach toward its activities and policy suggestions, and blockchain provides a chance to improve governance across a wide spectrum of private and governmental functions.Orzan says the technology could have a profound effect on multiple spheres of the global economy:“Having deeply analyzed both today's blockchain industry and possible developing scenarios, the WEF is clearly considering this technology a possible revolution in a series of industries and social institutions.”Orzan also believes government services could benefit the most from blockchain technology, followed by public and civic initiatives that could provide solutions to major issues around the world.Environmental issues are a particular concern, and Orzan envisions blockchain solutions having a major impact in this sphere:“The WEF just published the report ‘Building Block(chain)s for a Better Planet’, describing several contexts where it's possible to harness this technology to address environmental challenges. Being myself strongly involved in both policy and environmental matters, I definitely support looking deeply into every opportunity to start — quickly and proactively — exploring blockchain uses which can help improve the conditions of our planet and use of its resources.”What remains to be seen is which part of the world will truly drive a blockchain revolution in the coming years. With a growing interest around the globe, it is hard to predict, but Orzan suggests that this could happen in both America and Europe:“I personally expect North European countries [to take] the lead in the adoption of decentralized applications, being already at the top of most world rankings regarding transparency and integrity. Meanwhile, in the report ‘Best European Countries for Business 2018’ of the European Chamber, the same countries at the top of the ranking are those where there is a high interest in the benefits given by blockchain applications on governance transparency.”It is certainly encouraging to see an organization like the WEF driving a positive narrative concerning adoption and development of blockchain technology.The yearly World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland is a highly anticipated event for the global business and financial community. This year’s event saw widespread calls for cryptocurrency regulation, with mainstream financial institutions wanting more clarity before they made clear-cut plans to enter the crypto markets.Nine months down the line, this fresh rhetoric coming from WEF bodes well and we could potentially see far more positive sentiments toward the space in the years to come."

The platform is called cXchange and the company claims it is to be the most technologically advanced cryptocurrency exchange platform to date.","According to the Spotware statement, cXchange is a complete out-of-the-box solution that offers scalable architecture, an “ultra-fast” matching engine — which can support any asset — as well as a high level of security.In addition to the platform itself, Spotware offers native mobile apps on Android and iOS for cXchange customers. Technical support is offered for all customers and provided 24/7 by Spotware.One of the main advantages of the new solution is in its user-friendly logic and interface. “Many exchanges — even the most popular ones — can at times be complex and not very user-friendly. Exchanges created with our solution solve this issue,” emphasized Spotware CEO Alexander Shulman, in a comment to Cointelegraph.Another perk of the cXchange is that a lot of transactions — from trading commissions to withdrawal security settings — can be customized. The new platform offers an exchange operator an account management back office with a variety of settings to tailor their own digital asset exchange, and it is also integrated with blockchains for deposits and withdrawals. The team says the platform supports the entire user-lifecycle, providing traders with rich functionality and a range of charting tools, technical analysis and order types.In addition to the most popular cryptocurrencies, the platform allows users to list a range of different ERC-20 tokens and coins of completed ICO projects from the menu with minimal extra cost, as the official website states.Aside from the tokens, cXchange supports fiat trading pairs, whether the pair is crypto vs. fiat or fiat vs. fiat. Deposits and withdrawals can be possible by integrating payment processors, e-wallets, crypto wallets or by accepting wire transfers.The exchange operators can also set their own terms for getting liquidity and enabling market participants to integrate with the exchange via FIX API, a financial industry standard.The platform-as-a-service (PaaS) business logics implies that further development, maintenance and support is taken and ensured by Spotware. “This should save a lot of time and efforts for those willing to start a crypto exchange business, and they get regular updates and ongoing support,” Shulman told Cointelegraph.cXchange says it can be extended to accommodate unlimited users, trading accounts, assets and pairs. It also supports live chat, referral programs, dynamic fee discounts and its own white labels as add-on features.Spotware has been operating on the online trading market since 2010, with its flagship product, cTrader: the CFD and forex trading platform.“We used our expertise and proven technologies to create cXchange. There are only a few solutions available in the market resembling cXchange, but our platform is a high-quality product unlike other ones, as it was developed by a professional financial software development company,”  commented Shulman.Disclaimer.

Ethereum instead of Bitcoin, explaining the move because of “the 
Ethereum ...","Sep 21, 2018","On Sept. 17, a vital United States-based content delivery network (CDN) CloudFlare introduced a new decentralized content gateway via InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), a peer-to-peer (p2p) network run by thousands of computers bypassing the conventional HTTP system. Here’s how it supposed to work and why CloudFlare decided to support such a project.","CloudFlare is a company that provides content delivery network (CDN) services and DDoS protection. Basically, CloudFlare plays the role of an intermediary between the website and the visitor. It defends the website by filtering out suspicious requests and speeds up its overall performance via its CDN, powered by 152 data centers located in different parts of the world. As CloudFlare’s CEO Matthew Prince explained to the Wire:“At that data center, we’ll make a series of determinations: Are you a good guy or a bad guy? Are you trying to harm the site? Or are you actually a legitimate customer? If we determine that you’re a bad guy, we stop you there. We act essentially as this force shield that covers and protects our customers.”The company was created in 2009, when Prince and Lee Holloway, who had been jointly working on a system that tracked how spammers harvested email addresses (dubbed ‘Project Honey Pot’), met Michelle Zatlyn at the Harvard Business School, where Prince went to get his MBA. Together, they expanded the concept, came up with a new name and won the Harvard Business School Business Plan competition.The service itself quietly launched its beta in June 2010. On Sept. 27 of the same year, CloudFlare was officially launched at the TechCrunch Disrupt event in San Francisco. As per data stated on their website, the company serves around 8 million internet properties and “powers nearly 10 percent of all internet requests.” According to the Wire, Cloudflare customers vary “from individual bloggers who pay nothing for basic security services to Fortune 50 companies that pay up to a million dollars a year for guaranteed 24-hour support.”CloudFlare has been publicly championing net neutrality — the idea that networks should not discriminate against content that passes through them.On June 2, 2011, the controversial hacker collective Lulzsec tweeted “we love Cloudflare” after the service assisted in handling a DDoS attack on their website. That event seemed to accurately describe the position that Cloudflare had found itself in — while it had received widespread acknowledgment for its efficiency, the service — albeit somewhat indirectly — has protected people who could be deemed radicals.The situation escalated further in 2013, when Cloudflare was called “terrorists’ little helper” by a Kernel journalist for refusing to drop a Chechen news site Kavkaz Center. Prince then explained why the service chose to stand its ground in a blog post:""One of the greatest strengths of the United States is a belief that speech, particularly political speech, is sacred. A website, of course, is nothing but speech [...] A website is speech. It is not a bomb. There is no imminent danger it creates and no provider has an affirmative obligation to monitor and make determinations about the theoretically harmful nature of speech a site may contain.""In March 2017, the Southern Poverty Law Center published an article claiming that Cloudflare had been optimizing content delivery for “at least 48 hate sites across Europe.” A similar article was published by ProRepublica in May 2017. In response to the latter piece, Cloudflare reportedly updated its abuse reporting system to allow people to more safely file complaints about the material on its sites.In August 2017, Cloudflare decided to go against its net neutrality principles for the first time: After a neo-Nazi website The Daily Stormer wrote a hate-filled column dedicated to a white-supremacist rally in Charlottesville and went as far as to suggest that Cloudlflare’s top management shared their ideology by covering them, Prince decided to deny them service, setting a precedent.The policies mentioned above explain why creating a new decentralized content gateway seems like a logical step for Cloudflare. Called Cloudflare’s InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) Gateway, it serves as a simplified way to access the IPFS, which is a blockchain-based, peer-to-peer file system composed of thousands of computers that store files, acting as nodes within a global network.IPFS alters the conventional HTTP system the internet is largely based on. Instead of using the location-addressed system that HTTP entails — to access, say, Google, the client sends a request to the Google server’s IP, and the server returns a response message — it introduces a content-addressed system. Thus, the IPFS uses a cryptographic hash on a file as the address. CloudFlare explains this system with the following example:“So rather than asking the network ‘get me the content stored at 93.184.216.34,’ you ask ‘get me the content that has a hash value of QmXnnyufdzAWL5CqZ2RnSNgPbvCc1ALT73s6epPrRnZ1Xy’ […] The content with [that] hash could be stored on dozens of nodes, so if one node that was caching that content goes down, the network will just look for the content on another node.”The IPFS project was founded in 2014 by Juan Benet of Protocol Labs. It has since become an open-source project developed with help from the community.As Cointelegraph previously reported, the IPFS launched its distributed file storage network in 2016 on Ethereum instead of Bitcoin, explaining the move because of “the Ethereum Network’s supportive development community and various innovative features.”The company is being considerably ambitious about their new product. The press release boastfully states:“Just like when Cloudflare launched back in 2010 and changed the game for web properties by providing the security, performance and availability that was previously only available to the internet giants, we think the IPFS gateway will provide the same boost to content on the distributed web.”Indeed, at least theoretically, the new gateway simplifies the process of interacting with the decentralized network, allowing to access it with a casual browser:“At the most basic level, you can access any of the billions of files stored on IPFS from your browser. But that’s not the only cool thing you can do. Using Cloudflare’s gateway, you can also build a website that’s hosted entirely on IPFS, but still available to your users at a custom domain name.”To lure in new clients, CloudFlare is promoting their gateway by granting a free SSL certificate to any website connected via their new service, offering to secure it from “snooping and manipulation.”Further, perhaps in an attempt to prevent new net neutrality-related scandals, the company claims that “Cloudflare’s IPFS gateway is simply a cache in front of IPFS” and that they do not “have the ability to modify or remove content from the IPFS network,” reminding that there is the possibility of users sharing abusive content. For such cases, the company urges to use their “standard abuse reporting mechanism.”"

Unlike the apps that are based on built-in browsers, Lumi Collect is a separate platform designed to run on the Android and iOS devices. “We consider an app solution more secure than the web extension one,” the company says. Lumi allows users to keep all their collectibles in one wallet — including the unique ones and game assets based on Ethereum and ERC-721 tokens.","Lumi’s wallet displays all collectible assets associated with the user’s Ethereum address in My Collection tab. Also, the owners can see their ETH and token activity in Lumi Collect. The company promises that the next release will allow users to sign all the smart contracts transactions with a mobile Ethereum wallet. It would make it easier to breed a virtual cat or to send a “spaceship” for a new mission to another planet in collectible games. To do that, users would need to press the button “Pay” on the DApp website and, when the app opens, sign a transaction securely. The company promises even more functions for Lumi Collect’s users. For example, the team considers adding a marketplace for tokens, their ownership history and the prices that were paid to the crypto wallet. “We might enable smart contract functions inside the app — breed, gift, etc.,” the company says. Lumi is now planning new ways to increase its profit by selling additional slots for new games, which will be promoted in the “Explore” tab. The main idea of creating Lumi’s new wallet was to help crypto holders keep all their  “unique collectible characters in one place.” Most of these assets are from the games where players can breed and collect rare characters. For example, the users can already use Lumi Collect for their “adorable creatures” from CryptoKitties and assets from Blockchain Cuties. There are two more games that will be added to the system soon — Mycryptons and 0xUniverse. Lumi Collet supports collectibles and game assets based on Ethereum and ERC-721 tokens.Lumi has also announced an airdrop which will take place from Sept. 10 to Sept. 14, 2018. Users can receive free Cuties for making reposts and subscriptions.Besides the collectibles wallet, Lumi offers ERC-20 standard-compatible wallet, both in mobile and web versions. It allows users to buy, store and exchange Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum and tokens in one wallet. Users can see how much their assets — both cryptocurrencies and collectibles — are worth in BTC, ETH, and U.S. dollars and recent changes of the assets’ prices during the trading sessions. The security of the user’s funds is based on PIN codes and Face ID technology. It is also easy to restore the account in the case that it is stolen or lost: The user just needs to remember the 12-word backup phrase. The application is available through Apple’s App Store and Google Play. Disclaimer. Cointelegraph does not endorse any content or product on this page.

""The threat level is so high that the position could be stricter,"" he said. Furthermore, Peskov argued that the issuance of cryptocurrencies is contrary to basic state principals:""The issuance and circulation of cryptocurrencies cannot yet be permitted. It contradicts the basic functions of government. Order is important. If we adopt a bill on the principles of working with cryptocurrencies on the government level, then we can discuss the implementation of those principles in daily life.

Peskov is also the Director of Young Professionals at the Agency for Strategic Initiatives.Earlier this year Russian president Vladimir Putin himself addressed the crypto question during his annual live question and answer session. Putin said that Russia cannot have its own cryptocurrency, as cryptocurrency “by definition” cannot be controlled by a centralized entity.

According to Diar’s report, Chainalysis is followed by rival firms Elliptic and CipherTrace in terms of overall investment.The IRS reportedly accounts for the highest share of total government expenditure on blockchain intelligence, followed by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), as Diar’s consolidated data shows:U.S government agencies’ expenditure on contracts with blockchain analysis firms. Source: Diar.coWhile Diar notes that the IRS, ICE, and Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) have a combined 85 percentage of the total expenditure, several other government agencies have also sought smaller contracts with blockchain intelligence firms, including securities and commodities regulators.Diar’s Sept. 24 report also included a section devoted to Initial Coin Offerings (ICO), which have reportedly raised double in investments in 2018 ($12 billion) as compared with last year. However, Diar’s collected statistics have also shown that 70 percent of tokens “are now valued at less than what was raised during their ICO.” The report notes that 402 out of 562 projects that collectively raised over $8.2 billion are now worth $2.2 billion — a hefty $6 billion market capitalization loss.As a recent Cointelegraph analysis piece has outlined, the role of third-party blockchain intelligence firms was brought into the spotlight by the recent high-profile indictment from the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) against Russian officials who allegedly used crypto to fuel efforts to interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential elections.One of the most “heavily interviewed” experts in the wake of the indictment news was Jonathan Levin, co-founder and COO of Chainalysis, who declined to comment on the firm’s official involvement in the case."

digital asset traded in Taiwan including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin.","Oct 6, 2018","MaiCoin, the largest one stop digital asset platform provider in Taiwan, recently launched it’s MAX Exchange. The exchange initially started by offering Taiwan Dollar (TWD) to crypto pairs and it currently lists 16 crypto/TWD pairs. As part of its global aspirations, MAX Exchange has recently launched a total of 51 crypto to crypto pairs which include both USDT and TWDT stablecoin pairs.","While TWD fiat trading is only open to citizens of Taiwan, crypto-to-crypto pairs are now available for the global market, requiring MAX users to register with an email address for Level 1 access. According to the exchange website, this provides them with a $15,000 daily withdrawal limit. For users willing to provide a phone number and a selfie with ID verification, this daily withdrawal limit is increased to $150,000.“What sets MAX Exchange apart from the competition is that customer fiat assets are stored safely and securely with a third party bank trust custodian,” reported the MAX representatives to Cointelegraph. “We are also partnering with mobile phone providers on a solution to allow MAX Exchange users to store their private keys at the semiconductor level on their smartphone so that they are always in control of their own assets”.In order to develop and support its community ecosystem, MAX Exchange will launch its native token (MAX). 150 million MAX Tokens (30 percent of total supply) will be distributed via a Transaction (TX) Fee Mining model. What differentiates its TX mining model from previous iterations is that MAX incorporates a difficulty feature where mining rewards decrease as more coins are mined to slow down issuance and native tokens are purchased in the open market, the company explains.  The exchange plans to use 80 percent of its trading fees to purchase MAX tokens on the market as rewards for its makers (40 percent of fees), takers (10 percent of fees), and holders/stakers (30 percent of fees) on the platform.  MAX users can stake, or lock up, MAX tokens to increase their staking power by up to five times. “An ageing boost component is applied to staked coins. The longer coins are staked, the more their staking power increases”, added the MAX representative.The MAX Digital Asset Exchange is an extension of the business’ over the counter OTC platform, MaiCoin, which has been in operation since 2014. Combined, MAX and MaiCoin are the largest and longest running digital asset platforms on the Taiwanese market. In an interview with Bloomberg on Jan 30, Alex Liu, the founder and CEO of MaiCoin, said that he targeted continuing expansion of the business throughout Asia to help fill the void left by regulatory uncertainty in China and Korea.MAX and MaiCoin say they have been first to the market with almost every digital asset traded in Taiwan including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin.According to the company, in 2014, MaiCoin and MAX were the first platform to facilitate fiat deposits through thousands of 7-11 and Hi-Life convenience store ATMs and Kiosks nationwide.In 2015, the business moved into the merchant services industry, launching a series of applications to facilitate point of sale (POS) transactions that helped local businesses more seamlessly accept digital asset payments.  In 2016, MaiCoin established AMIS Technologies to build Ethereum based enterprise blockchain solutions for the domestic financial industry. Today AMIS is a founding member of the Ethereum Enterprise Alliance (EEA) and developer of the Istanbul Byzantine fault tolerant consensus protocol which has been employed as the consensus algorithm in JP Morgan’s Quorum platform. The group continues to build up its enterprise blockchain solutions and is working closely with ITRI, Fubon FHC, Taishin Bank among other major financial institutions.  Disclaimer. Cointelegraph does not endorse any content or product on this page.

Consensys has developed a decentralized app (DApp) for so-called self-sovereign identities, wherein certificates are not necessarily published on a blockchain, but only copied to the computers of numerous network participants.The copies can be encrypted so that the owner of a particular node in the respective network can decide on a case-by-case basis which certificates he or she makes visible to other network participants. Thus, the blockchain actually makes credentials physically portable for the students.Veronika Kütt, Research Associate at the FS Blockchain Center and Head of the pilot project, finds the opportunity to digitally present certificates ""fascinating"":""We are doing pioneer work here [...] Our students find it a privilege to be involved in new technology at an early stage. It's a bit like the programming of the first public Internet sites in the mid-'90s.""Professor Philipp Sandner, Head of the FS Blockchain Center, added:""With the blockchain you can store personal data, such as a CV or identity card, as in a picture book.

Researchers Detect Ambitious Bitcoin Mining Malware Campaign ...","Sep 17, 2018","Official government websites have become a prime target for cryptojacking in India, The Economic Times (ET) reports today, September 17.","Cryptojacking is the practice of infecting a target with malware that uses a computer’s processing power to mine for cryptocurrencies without the owner’s consent or knowledge.New research from cybersecurity analysts reportedly reveals that widely trusted government websites – including those of the director of the municipal administration of Andhra Pradesh, Tirupati Municipal Corporation and Macherla municipality – have become the latest to be exploited by the practice.Security Researcher Indrajeet Bhuyan told ET that:“Hackers target government websites for mining cryptocurrency because those websites get high traffic and mostly people trust them. Earlier, we saw a lot of government websites getting defaced (hacked). Now, injecting cryptojackers is more fashionable as the hacker can make money.”  According to the Times, Guwahati-based security researchers Shakil Ahmed, Anish Sarma and Bhuyan were the first to identify vulnerabilities on the AP government websites, all of which are subdomains of the extremely popular ap.gov.in – which is reported to receive over 160,000 visits per month.According to the ET, crytojacking appears rife on enterprise as well as government systems, with PublicWWW listing over 119 Indian websites that run Coinhive code – a script created to mine Monero (XMR) via a web browser.ET cites a recent Fortinet report that suggests cryptojacking has more than doubled between 2017 Q4 and 2018 Q1, with the percentage of affected enterprises rising from 13 to 28 percent.Fortinet’s Rajesh Maurya told ET that cryptojacking generates revenue “with a fraction of the effort and attention caused by ransomware,” noting that illegal video-streaming websites are a particularly lucrative target, as the script can make use of multiple CPU cycles to mine crypto as users watch movies or TV series.ET further reports that internet of things (IoT) products are considered by security experts to be “the next frontier” for cryptojackers, given that such devices have high processing power and yet may be idle for much of the day. ET’s search on IoT-focused search engine Shodan.io found that over 13,500 home routers in India were infected by cryptojacking malware – a figure that was only outflanked globally by Brazil.As previously reported, a research this summer from cyber security firm McAfee Labs revealed that cryptojacking malware activity had risen a staggering 629 percent in 2018 Q1."

Per Baidu, Super Chain nodes “use multi-core parallel computing to maximize CPU utilization and increase throughput.”The Super Chain is a stereo network that supports parallel sidechains. There is a root chain, which manages parallel chains and the operating guidelines of the entire network, that supports data exchange with each chain.The Super Chain operates on what is dubbed a “pluggable consensus mechanism.” Within the network, the Super Chain allows different parallel chains to choose their own consensus mechanisms. It also supports consensus escalation through a voting mechanism.The white paper states that Baidu will focus on applying the technology in food safety, product quality, new retail, new manufacturing, supply chain finance, intellectual property and trading, travel, tourism and social networking.Modular services with the Baidu Super Chain will include scenarios in certification, digital rights, clearing and settlement, supply chain finance, digital assets, and games.In June, the internet search giant revealed its Super Chain protocol in the context of reducing energy consumption in cryptocurrency mining operations."

Just last week, Cointelegraph reported on a new blockchain-related patent filed by IBM that would harness the technology to tackle privacy and security concerns for drones.A new report published late August indicated that IBM closely vied with Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba for the top spot on a new list that ranked entities by the number of blockchain-related patents filed to date.

Related News.","Oct 1, 2018","“Big Four” audit and consulting firm Deloitte has outlined five basic areas of development for blockchain technology in order achieve widespread adoption, according to a study published September 28.","According to Deloitte, in order to be adopted by enterprises on a mass scale, blockchain technology should overcome five major obstacles – the possibility of time-consuming operations, lack of standardization, high costs and complexity blockchain applications, regulatory uncertainty, as well as the absence of collaboration between blockchain-related firms.Identifying the area that needs the most development, Deloitte singled out the problem of possible operational delays on a distributed ledger network. The company emphasized that slow transaction speed is one of the main reasons for many players to avoid considering blockchain as a technology that can be applied in “large-scale applications.”Another major obstacle for blockchain on the path to widespread adoption is lack of standardization. Deloitte pointed out that the lack of standardization prevents technology disruptors from interact with each other. The consulting giant cites the fact that there are over 6,500 active blockchain projects on GitHub, with most of them based on different protocols, consensuses, privacy measures, as well as written in different coding languages.Among the remaining areas for development, Deloitte listed the necessity to reduce both costs and complexity of network operations, the importance of innovation-supporting regulation, as well as the crucial role of collaboration between blockchain-related firms.In terms of costs and complexity of the emerging technology, Deloitte referred to major technology giants such as Amazon, IBM, and Microsoft that have reportedly delivered less complicated implementations of blockchain by using cloud technology, as well as contributed to improving the costs of operations on blockchain.Among the most complex issues around blockchain regulation, the company highlighted the difficulty of regulating smart contracts, which do not necessarily fit into existing frameworks.The report’s final point stresses the importance of cooperation between blockchain-related firms in order to push forward the new deployments of the technology, as well as to provide better education in the sphere. The company says the increasing number of blockchain consortia, such as R3, is a “bullish sign,” because the “value of a blockchain network increases with the number of users.”Last month, Cointelegraph published an interview with Jeremy Gardner, founder of Blockchain Education Network and co-founder of blockchain prediction platform Augur. In the interview, the industry expert claimed that in order to achieve mass adoption, those developing in the industry must “include the people who have the most benefit” from blockchain technology – namely the world’s disenfranchised – commenting that “we haven’t done a great job doing that, yet.”"

According to the Economic Times India, Dell had the highest overall market share of the Indian server market in Q1 2018 at 28.3 percent, up from 19.4 percent in the previous quarter.Manish Gupta, senior director and general manager at Infrastructure Solutions Group, Dell EMC India, is quoted by the Economic Times India as saying that:“The clients that we work with are looking to tap these technologies, which is why we are bringing in servers that allows them to optimise on traditional workloads as well as invest into new age workloads such as cloud, artificial intelligence, analytics and blockchain.”Dell’s servers and networking business reportedly drew a revenue of $5.1 billion in Q2 2018, a 34 percent increase from the same quarter the previous year.Gupta told the Economic Times India that demand is particularly strong from “IT-enabled services, banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) sector and government.” He added that interest in blockchain has been piqued in the country’s government in particular, alongside the BFSI sector.As reported earlier this summer, the Indian state of Telangana has announced it would be signing several memoranda of understanding (MoUs) with blockchain firms as to eventually implement the technology across government services.While receptive to blockchain, the country’s highest judiciary is currently in the midst of reviewing the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)’s contentious ban on banks’ dealings with crypto-related entities. Just yesterday, India’s Supreme Court listened to the final round of petitions on the ban, which has officially been in force since July 6."

G- ...,"Oct 6, 2018","Cryptocurrency finance company Circle Internet Financial Ltd. has acquired equity crowdfunding platform and broker-dealer SeedInvest, according to an announcement published October 5. Exact terms of the transaction were not disclosed.","New York-based SeedInvest was founded in 2012 as a startup investing platform. Since then, the company has reportedly raised capital for 220 firms through more than 240,000 investors. The average investment per company through SeedInvest is said to be $500,000, while the largest investment was$2,000,000.Once the acquisition is approved by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), it will reportedly enable Circle to expand SeedInvest’s offerings to support cryptocurrencies, including fiat stablecoins and issuing and offering tokenized securities.Additionally, companies will reportedly be able to raise capital through a regulated platform, get access to retail investor portfolios via Circle Invest, and provide investors with secondary market liquidity on Circle’s cryptocurrency exchange. Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire told Bloomberg in an interview:“This was a company who had been at the forefront of collaborating with government to figure out how to make it possible to innovate in the way people raise capital. Crypto securities are going to become a major new category of securities that ultimately every business is going to adopt, just like every business has a website.”Earlier this week, Circle launched a new feature for its crypto investment app Circle Invest dubbed “Collections,” that gives customers the option to invest in one or more collections of crypto assets, each divided according to a particular theme: “Platforms, Payments, and Privacy.”  After choosing a collection category, users can invest in the entire category in one swoop.In September, Circle launched a USD-backed digital token dubbed the “USD Coin (USDC).” Per Circle, over 20 companies are about to announce support for USDC, while others might add trading through the open ERC-20 standard.Circle was founded in 2013 by investment banking and management giant Goldman Sachs. The company offers four products including Circle Pay, which is a fiat money sending service with a social messaging component, and Circle Trade, which is a liquidity provider of cryptocurrencies and reportedly moves over $2 billion each month."

Crypto Platform Sees Its User Base Grow Amid the Global Pandemic.","Oct 4, 2018","South Korean crypto exchange Bithumb, currently the world’s sixth largest by daily traded volume, will open a global decentralized crypto exchange, Business Korea reports Oct. 4.","Bithumb has partnered with blockchain firm One Root Network (RNT), which has developed an Ethereum (ETH)-based decentralized token transaction protocol dubbed “R1” and already operates a decentralized exchange (DEX). According to a joint press release, the protocol separates order matching and order execution, which RNT claims improves security and matching efficiency.Decentralized platforms enable users to trade peer-to-peer via an automated system; as they do not store clients’ crypto, they are less vulnerable to thefts that target a centralized point of attack. They can, however, as Business Korea notes, offer relatively slower trading speeds than their centralized counterparts.Business Korea cites a Bithumb official as saying that the partnership centers on technical support, clarifying that “Bithumb DEX will be operated by its overseas subsidiary. The company is working together with RNT only in the decentralized exchange sector.”As RNT has outlined, its project aims to enable traffic holders such as Bithumb to build their own decentralized platforms, and share transaction data and liquidity with other R1 protocol users as part of a wider ecosystem.   Business Korea further cites an unnamed industry source as saying that the partnership represents a global expansion strategy by the Korean exchange:“Bithumb is one of the leading global exchanges in terms of transactions but it is true that most of its users are Korean. The latest decision seems to be the company’s strategy to compete with other leading exchanges in the global market by opening a decentralized exchange that receives attention in the global market.”Business Korea notes that rival Korean exchange Upbit has also made a foray into the DEX space through its investment in Allbit.As reported in August, the world’s largest crypto trading platform Binance has released a simple demo of its own forthcoming decentralized exchange, without yet disclosing an expected launch date.As of press time, Bithumb is seeing $336,761,580 in daily trades, according to data from CoinMarketCap."

champion and early adopter of Bitcoin which it describes as “a martyr ...","Sep 25, 2018",Can you remember exactly what you did on social media 10 days ago?,"Probably not. The days can blend together as you embark on a never-ending quest of liking posts and sharing memes.Social media can also have a detrimental effect on our mental health – with charities warning they could be particularly harmful if we compare the picture-perfect, filtered images posted by our friends to our own lives.Although these networks play a vital role in our daily lives – with research suggesting we now spend 135 minutes a day browsing and posting on such sites – a blockchain-based social platform is now trying to inject meaning into the interactions we have online by enabling physical meetings and friendships.Kuende describes itself as a “hybrid online-offline social network,” and its main target market are millennials (aged 22 to 37) and Generation Z (currently aged between 13 and 23.)The goal is to connect people with similar interests and gamify socialization in the real world, in the hope that users “will create healthy, real-life connections without any costs.” Explaining its objectives, Kuende says it wants community hotspots and local businesses to play a starring role in arranging these challenges – eliminating the need for excessive ads.Kuende says it is determined to make a positive impact and give people an exciting chance to find and express themselves in ways that might not have been open to them before. The company is intent on making a difference while remaining entertaining its user base.“Our mission grew out of seeing a world full of teenagers allowing digital interactions to replace real ones, creating significant personal harm,” the company explained.The company has illustrated its progress through a series of stats. It has received $2.6 million of investment to date,  and says it has managed to deliver products on time for the past three years. According to Kuende, the company closed their $2 million soft cap for the ICO within days. Kuende applications for websites and smartphones are available, and the company’s apps have been downloaded more than 20,000 times – and its software for Android currently enjoys a 4.8 rating on the Google Play Store. In total, it has more than 60,000 registered users without a marketing campaign.In September, Kuende announced that Charlie Shrem – a cryptocurrency champion and early adopter of Bitcoin which it describes as “a martyr for the cause of decentralized currency” – had joined its advisory board. Pavel Antohe, the CEO and founder of Kuende, described the meeting as “successful far beyond what I could have imagined,” adding: “A perfect chemistry formed between his vision of how the blockchain is changing the world and our vision. It was clear how it will help us make our micro-economy transparent and secure, to reward our user and help and support the mass blockchain adoption.”Antohe explained in the blog post that Shrem was passionate about Kuende because of the company’s experienced team, which includes Google veterans. The fact that the social network was already up and running, albeit with plans to upgrade the app and its gamification plans through an initial coin offering, also piqued his interest.According to Pavel, Shrem is also excited about Kuende’s “realistic and achievable checkpoints every quarter.” Its initial coin offering is currently taking place, and throughout the rest of this year, anti-fraud mechanisms, security audits, bounty campaigns, blockchain integration and improvements to its challenge framework will take place.Kuende plans to acquire users in the Asian market first, and says several local governments on the continent are encouraging similar offline behaviors that align perfectly with its vision. It is going to develop its own blockchain using Tendermint technology for the Cosmos ecosystem. This will allow Kuende to offer “privacy, security and performance without any compromises,” and it will enable users without any technical experience to take part in the blockchain’s governance. The company says it will be the first all-in-one social media platform in the Cosmos hub, with the ledger paving the way for a “free market internet of blockchains.”A whitelisting process is taking place until Oct 15, and this will be followed by a public sale running from 19 October to 2 Nov. Most of the proceeds will go towards marketing the platform, in addition to research and development.Kuende says it is offering a unique public sale bonus structure thanks to the support it received from the private round investors and from their current partners including Sirin Labs, Bancor, Civic, Stox or IPSX.Disclaimer.

Crypto Platform Sees Its User Base Grow ...","Sep 26, 2018","The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is seeking sanctions against the individuals behind the allegedly fraudulent Initial Coin Offering (ICO) known as PlexCoin, Finance Feeds reports September 26.","The SEC has been involved in ongoing court proceedings against the owners of the associated firm PlexCorps — Dominic Lacroix and Sabrina Paradis-Royer — at the New York Eastern District Court since December 2017. The SEC’s initial complaint had charged the pair with violating securities law in respect to PlexCorps’ PlexCoin ICO in August 2017.The complaint had accused Lacroix — whom it called “a recidivist securities law violator in Canada” — and his partner of “misappropriating” investor funds that were “illegally” raised in a misleading, deceptive, and unregistered securities offering. The PlexCoin ICO is alleged to have raised $15 million from “thousands of investors,” reportedly promising investors a 1,354 percent return in just 29 days.In the ensuing months, the regulator has twice sued Lacroix for securities fraud and issued two emergency asset freeze orders against him.According to the SEC, the duo have continued to ignore a succession of Court orders concerning the “discovery, accounting [...] and repatriation of assets.” The regulator therefore chose to file a motion to compel and a motion for discovery sanctions against the duo yesterday, Sept. 25.The ignored injunctions are said to have included a court order from December 2017 that enjoined the defendants to produce — within three business days — “a sworn verified written accounting” reflecting the amounts and locations of investor assets raised from the PlexCoin ICO, and to “immediately” transfer to the registry of the Court all assets “derived from PlexCoin or PlexCoin Tokens or PlexCorps.”Despite an extension of the deadline and further injunctions to provide the SEC with “a full list of bank and brokerage accounts [...] and any blockchain addresses through which investor funds were solicited or received,” Lacroix and Paradis-Royer have reportedly failed to comply with any of these orders. They are further reported to have ignored a court order from this August, which demanded further accounting documents pertaining to investor funds as well as the defendants’ assets.The SEC has this week argued that the defendants demonstrate no intention of “participating meaningfully” in the ongoing litigation, and could potentially employ a deferral strategy “indefinitely, including potentially after the entry of a preliminary injunction.” The SEC has reportedly noted that such a persistent failure to comply with court demands could further facilitate the pair’s potential dissipation of investor assets.In a recent high-profile development for the crypto regulatory landscape in the U.S., a New York federal judge has ruled this month that securities laws are applicable for dealing with crypto fraud allegations."

Source: DiarVC median blockchain investment, 2013-18.

The outlier was the DFINITY token, which raised a combined $163 million from VC investors Andreessen Horowitz, Hashed, and Polychain Capital.Pitchbook’s figures revealed that Barry Silbert’s Digital Currency Group (DCG) was “by far” the most prolific investor from the VC sector, closing over 110 deals in the crypto and blockchain space this year. DCG outflanked both Blockchain Capital and Pantera Capital, whose combined deals clocked in at 100.Other strong investors included VC firms Andreessen Horowitz, Danhua Capital, and Future Perfect Ventures, alongside “active angels” Tim Draper, Naval Ravikant, Roger Ver, and Barry Silbert.Beyond these major players, Diar reports that close to 2,000 investors have closed deals with at least one blockchain firm this year — the fifty most active of these have invested in “at least” eight. In terms of investor profiles, 52 percent of investors were not exclusively focused on the crypto and blockchain sector, but sealed their deals as part of a more diverse portfolio.Lastly, Diar also analyzed the geographic distribution of the VC capital that flows into blockchain, with U.S.-based investors representing the lion’s share at 79 percent, followed by 12 percent from China, and 2 percent from South Korea and Singapore respectively.Diar’s new report also includes a section on the phenomenon of new banking operations that aim to facilitate the blockchain industry, whether blockchain-exclusive banks built “from the ground up,” banks that integrate fiat and crypto services, or the rising number of crypto-related firms that are securing banking licenses.As reported earlier today, South Korea’s largest VC firm, Korea Investment Partners (KIP), has invested in its first blockchain startup — one that specializes in harnessing the technology for supply chain management solutions. KIP is known for its investments in high-ranking firms that include Naver — Korea’s largest search engine, as well as owner of the popular Japanese messaging app LINE — and Korean messaging giant Kakao, among others."

Per the statement, the details of the settlement will remain confidential while “both sides look forward to putting these disputes behind them.”","The litigation between Ripple Labs and R3 Consortium began in September 2017, when the consortium filed a lawsuit in Delaware and New York against Ripple Labs. R3 then claimed that Ripple had violated a prior purchase agreement between the two companies for XRP tokens. The agreement included an option enabling R3 to buy up to 5 billion XRP tokens, in part or in whole, at a price of $0.0085 before the end of 2019.A Delaware judge threw out the case against Ripple in October 2017, forcing the plaintiff to proceed litigation in California and New York.Ripple Labs subsequently filed a counterclaim in California, where it accused R3 of breaching a number of commitments within the agreement. When the parties began the proceedings, the value of the contract in dispute totalled more that $1 million, however after several months the XRP price surged, significantly increasing the stakes as the 5 billion XRP in question were worth about $3.85 billion.In March 2018, a San Francisco state appeals court denied Ripple’s filing to appeal the order that dismissed its lawsuit against R3.Ripple has been involved in several legal battles over the last year. In May, investor Ryan Coffey filed a lawsuit over whether or not the XRP token is a security. Coffey alleged that Ripple’s sale of XRP tokens violates U.S. securities laws.

Core developer of Ethereum Joey Zhou pointed this out in a tweet posted Tuesday, Oct. 2.","Zhou has tweeted that Petro, which has just been officially launched by president Nicolas Maduro, is ""a blatant Dash clone."" To illustrate this, he posted a link to the Venezuelan coin’s white paper, which had an exact copy of an image from Dash's repository on Github.An image from Dash’s repository on Github, added to p. 11 of Petro’s white paper with an added title in Spanish. Screenshot: CointelegraphThe ""clone"" image is not the only thing that Petro apparently borrowed from Dash. The technical description of the coin says that it will use the X11 Proof-of-Work (PoW) mining algorithm, the same that is used by Dash.While many cryptocurrencies use common cryptographic algorithms – such as Bitcoin’s SHA-256 – Petro also uses ""nodos maestros,"" or masternodes – a well-known mechanism used by Dash to regulate its ecosystem.The last but not least of the coincidences is Instant Send – Dash's mechanism for fast transactions and also one of the most important characteristics of Petro, as per its white paper:""One of the most important characteristics of Petro is instant send (less than 5 seconds) of the transactions, which represents an innovative approach and Petro's significant impact in comparison with existing cryptocurrencies.""The news comes shortly after Venezuela’s president announced the official sale of Petro, which is slated to start November 5.Maduro has also stated that the oil-backed cryptocurrency is about to begin trading on six major crypto exchanges.

Now the company is looking for a chief financial officer (CFO). Robinhood CEO Baiju Bhatt added that the startup is undergoing a spate of audits from the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) in order to ensure regulatory compliance.","After raising $363 million in a series D funding round and $110 million in a series C round, Robinhood was valued at $5.6 billion, making it the second most valuable fintech startup in the U.S. Currently, there are reportedly five million users conducting trades with cryptocurrencies on the Robinhood platform. Let’s recall the path of a mobile startup to the promising position it now occupies.Dubbed by the press as a ""trading app for millennials,"" before its involvement in crypto, Robinhood existed as a solely mobile application for stock trade. It had a plain and simple, user-friendly design, democratic deposit levels (i.e., aimed at under $1,000 users) and something much more revolutionary — a zero fee for trading the stocks. As the statement still goes on the official site main page:“We believe that the financial system should work for the rest of us, not just the wealthy [...] We’ve cut the fat that makes other brokerages costly, like manual account management and hundreds of storefront locations, so we can offer zero commission trading.”That came as a revelation for the users that didn’t want to be charged from $1 to $10 a trade just to pay for overhead. Although, the simplicity came with some limits to functionality: Users could not short sell or trade mutual funds, options or fixed income instruments. As Investopedia notes, “research was limited to very basic pricing graphs and dates for corporate events, with the assumption that millennials, their target customer group, would find any data they need to make buying decisions on other websites.”The iOS and Android apps were launched in 2015, now Robinhood allows trading from the desktop as well. Back in the early days, Techcrunch wrote about Robinhood’s integration ambitions, mentioning its collaboration with Stocktwits, Openfolio and Quantopian. As for now, the app doesn’t have a publicly available API but, according to the official site, is working to provide this in the near future.Robinhood business model involves earning interest on uninvested cash in customer accounts. Experts highlight that the app also pass through any regulatory fees that are incurred when a trade is placed: “These are typically fractions of a penny, but the firm rounds those fees up to the nearest penny.”But the main source of income for Robinhood is margin trading — i.e., lending a money with an interest rate to the owners of Robinhood Gold accounts. The account minimum for Robinhood Gold, the broker’s “premium margin account,” is $2,000, which is a regulatory requirement that all brokers must follow. The user pays a fee every month for access to a set amount of margin loans, whether he/she uses the money or not, starting at $6/month for an additional $1,000. The monthly price rises with the account size and borrowing potential, going up to $200 per month for $50,000+ account sizes. In February 2018, Robinhood launched its no-commission cryptocurrency trading division with a signature, Tron-themed design. Originally, it had supported only Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), with trading available for U.S. residents in California, Massachusetts, Missouri, Montana and New Hampshire. In July, the app has added support for Litecoin (LTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and then later, for Ethereum Classic (ETC) and Dogecoin (DOGE). Robinhood Crypto is currently available in 19 states of the U.S.In the first four days of the Robinhood Crypto announcement, it had one million users signed-up. The company’s co-CEO, Vlad Tenev, told Fortune that the crypto division is not as much a source of profit as it is an important buildup to the company ecosystem:“We don’t intend to make very much money on it at all for the foreseeable future [...] We intend to operate it as a breakeven business [...] The thinking behind that is what we’re really doing is building an ecosystem. Right now the products are investing products, so crypto slots in very nicely alongside the 10,000 plus other instruments that people can trade.”While Robinhood allows traders to buy and sell crypto on the platform, users cannot transfer assets purchased on the platform to a third-party wallet. In June, rumors arose that Robinhood was going to launch a cryptocurrency wallet following a job advertisement for multiskilled cryptocurrency engineers posted by the startup. In the same month, “people familiar with the matter” told Bloomberg that Robinhood plans to obtain a banking license, with “constructive” talks with the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to position itself as a banking services provider.The job description fueled the attention to the product even more:""What has been created so far only scratches the surface of how Robinhood envisions cryptocurrencies to play a role in our users’ lives.""That caused a wave of interest in the crypto community, as users and media outlets shared their opinions about the hypothetical threat to the dominating crypto digital wallets, such as a market leader like Coinbase, which charges customers a two percent transaction fee or more for buying and selling cryptocurrency. Earlier, Robinhood co-founder and co-CEO Baiju Bhatt also expressed some serious ambitions:“We expect by the end of the year to be either the largest or one of the largest crypto platforms out there [...] We also really feel we'll have the absolute best experience for investing in crypto as well.”Company’s potential in crypto was also highlighted and backed by investments by venture capital firm Sequoia Capital. As stated by Sequoia partner Andrew Reed:“Robinhood's produce cadence has been very impressive [...] [Sequoia Capital] invested because we think that Robinhood has the potential to bring its low-cost and user-first approach to revolutionize large portions of financial services.”Robinhood isn’t immune to criticism. Aside from the alarmist Time note, focusing on the dangers of a simple design and careless enthusiasm of non-professional investors, the trading platform has been exposed for some flows, precisely as a stock market instrument. The most important is the lack of benefits for the large investors, as if the tool was only meant to satisfact the under-$1,000 accounts.Investopedia notes that “Robinhood’s order execution engine does not seek out price improvement opportunities, which is something investors who trade large lots of 500 shares or more look for in a broker.” In some cases, the free transaction nature of Robinhood wouldn’t compensate the large investor for the absence of price improvement tools, which would made the app less attractive than its more conservative competitors.Moreover, Fortune magazine warns that “like many tech startups planning to go public these days.” Robinhood is still losing money:“The thing is, investors in IPOs are willing to tolerate losses as long as they will be turned soon enough into growing profits. And they’ve learned to distrust CEOs who talk cavalierly about losing money. Witness the downfall of Groupon after its manic growth failed to deliver profits, or Uber, which has had to retool its expensive global ambitions.”Theresa W. Carey of Investopedia also calls attention to the threat that monetization necessarily poses to Robinhood’s core feature, the zero-fee transaction:“At some point, those venture capitalists are going to want some return on their investment, and zero commission trading removes a major source of revenue. But free trades are the key feature Robinhood offers. They will have to generate revenue somehow.”As for the digital currencies, the Robinhood Crypto app didn’t spark any substantial controversy, is still enjoying a good reputation and produces optimism in small investors who are tired of the transaction fees imposed by the established players. The level of attention to the company’s hiring announcements this summer showed that the market definitely welcomes new competitors and is interested in any chance of establishing closer ties with the traditional investment universe."

The bank has reportedly earmarked $10.8 billion for technology spending in 2018, $5 billion of which will go towards fintech investments.The study covers JPMorgan’s digital transformation roadmap, with blockchain listed as the first in a range of bleeding-edge technologies that are being pursued by the bank — including big data, cloud, artificial intelligence (AI), and robotics.It outlines a range of approaches that JPMorgan has undertaken, including establishing accelerators and incubators, investing, acquiring or forming partnerships with fintech startups, and moving away from legacy systems towards newer, disruptive solutions.As RM underscores, all these strategies are part of a bid to become a leading digital bank. The study also outlines recommendations for other market participants to similarly “embrace” wide-ranging fintech innovation.Just last week, Cointelegraph reported that JPMorgan had expanded its blockchain payment platform to over 75 multinational banks as part of participants’ combined efforts to fight off competition from outside of the banking sector. The bank first began testing the platform in April with partners that included Goldman Sachs, Pfizer Inc., and the National Bank of Canada.This August, JPMorgan’s’s CIO Lori Beer forecast that blockchain would “replace existing technology” within a matter of “a few years.” The bank remains, however, notably risk-averse when it comes to cryptocurrencies, with CEO Jamie Dimon making notorious anti-Bitcoin (BTC) remarks on several occasions. Nonetheless, other senior figures within the company have hinted at a potential more receptive stance towards the crypto space."

May Be Here as Bulls Try to Prevent New All-Time Low.","Sep 9, 2018","Competition in the business of facilitating cross-border payments has just gotten tighter. Until recently, the primary fintech challenger to the reigning SWIFT international payment system has been Ripple Labs and its various products designed for the institutional banking sector. The first week of September saw the game-changing news break, as IBM announced promotion of its DLT-powered payment system, Blockchain World Wire (BWW), from beta to a ready-for-use product.","Operating on the Stellar blockchain, the new financial rail will provide an infrastructure for clearing and settling cross-border payments with finality “in near real-time,” at the same time reducing transaction costs by removing third-party intermediaries from the process. Pervasiveness of IBM-powered solutions in global finance — the company claims to be handling around 60 percent of the world’s transactional systems — provides BWW with a hefty launching pad, immediately propelling it to the top tier of the industry that is poised to grow to a size of $2 trillion by 2020.IBM and Stellar were first spotted jointly developing cross-border financial solutions in October 2017, when they unveiled a plan to build a transaction infrastructure for the South Pacific region alongside KlickEx, a New Zealand-based payments network. The news of another high-profile deployment of the Stellar blockchain by IBM came this May, when Big Blue teamed up with Veridium Labs to help companies track their carbon emissions on a distributed ledger. Finally, in July, IBM announced the launch of Stronghold USD, a U.S. dollar-pegged stable coin run on the Stellar network, in a partnership with financial services provider Stronghold. The latter move was set to become consequential for the Blockchain World Wire system, which at that time was still in the works.The mechanics of the new payment system are fairly straightforward and rely on the notion of a bridge asset — a carrier of value on the network that can be exchanged to any fiat currency on each side of a transaction. As two financial institutions negotiate a payment, they “agree to use a stable coin, central bank digital currency or other digital asset as the bridge asset between any two fiat currencies.” Although this formulation presents a range of bridge asset options, the timing of the Stronghold USD launch suggests that it is the stable coin that is designed to serve as a primary vehicle of Blockchain World Wire transactions.IBM also stresses that the new financial rail is built to integrate seamlessly with existing payments systems through its API, so banks won’t have to implement sweeping hardware changes in order to start using it. Once the sender’s fiat currency is converted into a proxy digital asset, the system instantaneously turns it into the respective amount of the receiver’s fiat currency. All the transaction details and settlement instructions are then recorded on the distributed ledger.In an apparent attempt to appeal to the widest possible array of institutional clients, IBM marketers cautiously specify in a footnote that “for those preferring to avoid the use of digital currencies, IBM also provides alternative settlement methods,” without defining, however, what those would be.Even before setting out to explore the territory that is usually considered within Ripple’s jurisdiction — transactional services for large corporate banks — Stellar was doomed to have all its achievements measured against those of its older sibling. Both Ripple and Stellar protocols are, to a significant extent, defined by the vision of one person — Stellar’s current CTO Jed McCaleb — and as such, share a lot of design features. Yet, unlike Ripple, Stellar is completely open-source and not beholden to a single corporate entity. While Ripple has long been seen mainly as a solution provider for banks, Stellar developed a reputation of being a payment network for individuals.Ripple’s brisk ascent to the rank of the third largest crypto asset by market capitalization at the turn of last year has been largely predicated on a streak of successful pitches of its services to major financial institutions. The biggest deals that Ripple managed to secure included a foreign exchange service for Santander, as well as a payment app built for a consortium of 61 Japanese banks.These big wins, however, come with an important caveat: both are based on a technology called xCurrent, which doesn’t make any use of XRP, Ripple’s native token. Meanwhile, the product that does rely on XRP, called xRapid, has been seeing more modest rates of adoption. Particularly, several major money transfer services, including Western Union and MoneyGram, announced earlier in the year that they would start testing xRapid-powered transactions. Several months later, Western Union CEO Hikmet Ersek said that the solution hadn’t delivered any significant reduction in transaction cost and was “still too expensive.” The disparity in xCurrent and xRapid’s performance has led some critics to conclude that XRP token doesn’t have any use.Thus, bringing in a newly-minted stable coin to power cross-border transactions on the Stellar blockchain looks like a smart move from IBM and Stellar. In doing so, they will retain the ‘XRP for the people’ ethos that has developed around Stellar XLM token, and clearly demarcate the boundary between the corporate and community uses of the Stellar ledger. Of course, there are also more immediately practical considerations at play. Jesse Lund, the head of IBM’s blockchain department, noted in a blog post:“Volatility and inherent risk means that most financial institutions are wary of using cryptocurrencies as the basis for mainstream commercial transactions and why some countries have banned their use entirely… The ‘stability’ of stable coins could translate into improving the entire backbone of international banking operations, giving banks an innovative way to significantly update their core banking and compliance infrastructure while also helping to improve operational efficiency and regulatory transparency.”It remains to be seen if reliance on stable coins will grant Blockchain World Wire a sizeable competitive advantage over Ripple’s solutions. What already does look like a serious advantage, though, is IBM’s stalwart position as a major infrastructure provider for traditional transactional systems: The cost of convincing existing clients to adopt a new technology is by long odds smaller than acquiring new ones.Judging from what is known about Blockchain World Wire at this point, the system’s design and functionality directly pit it against Ripple’s xRapid rail in the race for global banks’ good graces. Despite the dearth of information on how the two compare in terms of performance, it is possible to pinpoint a few more general product features that might prove relevant as BWW hits the market and the competition ramps up. In addition to the impressive base for adoption already mentioned above, IBM’s solution looks appealing for its versatility. Whereas xRapid utilizes only XRP token as a bridge asset, Blockchain World Wire boasts a range of options, which could potentially open the system up for many fruitful integrations and partnerships.That said, it is not yet clear when financial institutions will be able to derive practical benefits from adopting IBM’s new product, as it hasn’t even been tested in the field. In contrast, xRapid has been out there for a while, undergoing tests with some of the key players of the money transfer industry for months now.Also, it is worth noting that the market of cross-national, blockchain-powered financial services is far from a duopolistic arrangement divided solely between Ripple and BWW. In late June, Ant Financial, Alibaba’s financial arm, deployed a remittance solution on blockchain to facilitate transactions between Hong Kong and the Philippines. Meanwhile, Japanese tech giant GMO is equipping its new online banking service with a blockchain-powered transaction system. As some of these and other emerging platforms are likely to achieve a certain degree of regional dominance, on the global scale, years of stiff competition lie ahead.Blockchain World Wire’s inaugural public presentation will take place in Sydney in late October. Symbolically, it is bound to happen at Sibos — an annual summit for global financial industry hosted by SWIFT."

Blockchain Firm's DApp for Ads Now Available ...","Sep 12, 2018","A new, decentralized global platform is aiming to help streamers keep more of their earnings — and create a blockchain-driven ecosystem where they will find it easier to receive donations from their loyal viewers.","According to DeStream, the esports market is growing, and as a result, audiences on popular streaming services such as Twitch, YouTube and Mixer are increasing by an average of 10 percent a quarter. This has coincided with a rise in the sums of money being donated to streamers by appreciative fans. A company presentation cites figures from SuperData Research which show donations to professional gamers neared $800 million in 2017 alone.DeStream announced that the ecosystem will be integrated first in such streaming services as Youtube, Twitch, Mixer and afreecaTV. The company believes these integrations may increase the initial price of the DST token because they will be widely used among streamers and would lay a strong foundation that should keep the project afloat, compared to other IСOs. Whereas talents currently face high fees from the offered payment gateways, DeStream is planning to reduce them substantially — to 0.77 percent per transaction.The startup also wants to make it easier for content creators to access other revenue streams which, until now, have been the preserve of top-tier talent. DeStream says its infrastructure will enable advertisers to launch campaigns with the sector’s rising stars, and use big data to ensure their promotions reach the right people and achieve the biggest possible impact.According to DeStream, its suite of solutions will help reduce the distractions facing streamers and give them the opportunity to focus on producing premium broadcasts. The company stresses that it is not designed to be a streaming platform — but instead will be integrated into existing ones.To engage viewers, streamers will be able to use dozens of smart contract templates “for the implementation of almost any idea,” the platform’s white paper reveals. Fans stand to benefit because they will enjoy higher levels of engagement with their idols — with features such as live voting by using tokens, enabling them to be active participants during a stream rather than passive viewers. An internal marketplace also means fans can purchase skins and in-game goods in one place.DeStream says that the DST token is going to be at the beating heart of its ecosystem and will offer a plethora of features. As well as enabling viewers to make donations, it will mean streamers can be rewarded by advertisers for engagement. While the company is aiming to make withdrawing funds easy for streamers, it hopes to simplify managing funds further in future by launching a debit card, enabling them to spend their income in stores or withdraw cash from ATMs.DeStream is also creating a not-for-profit organization known as the Worldwide Streamers Association, which has the goal of maintaining and developing the industry and allowing professionals to share their experiences and train others. In time, it’s hoped that this association will help promote the market and help businesses thrive.The company has released a detailed roadmap which unveils its priorities for the future. During the first half of 2019, DeStream hopes to run an alpha version of its platform — including a mobile app — and develop a blockchain-based voting system. Later in the year, it hopes to launch a beta version of its marketplace and throw an annual event known as DeStream Festival. Following testing, its mobile applications are also set to be released for the first time.Its public token sale ends on Sept. 30.The co-founder and chief executive of DeStream is Anar Mekhtiev. As well as teaching a number of courses focused on blockchain, he has more than 15 years’ experience in software development.

Pay-to-Play Gaming Is Flawed, Blockchain-Based Platform Says.","Sep 20, 2018","On Sept. 19, the Play2Live streaming platform for gamers and esports fans has officially announced the launch of the open beta testing of their blockchain streaming platform to the general public.","The new blockchain platform aims to let participants benefit from monetization schemes — involving streamers, viewers and esports tournament organizers. As Play2Live told Cointelegraph earlier, “Everybody can be part of the peer-to-peer interaction, and everybody,  even the viewer, is able to earn money.”As the company reported to Cointelegraph, on Aug. 15, the access to the testing phase was first granted to media representatives and accredited streamers in order to check the operational capacities of the platform’s basic functionality. Two days later, any interested participant will be able to join the beta testing phase.According to Play2Live CEO Alexei Burdyko, some developments of the new blockchain platform have never been used in esports before:“In the opinion of the leading experts, one of the interesting benefits of the project includes the possibility of buying and earning LUC tokens directly [on] the platform's website,” he commented in the official press release.The coins can be used for implementing different monetization options, including donations, voting and for assigning special tasks to streamers, according to the official announcement. At the same time as the closed beta test was announced, Play2Live started the LUC tokens buy-back. From 10,000,000 to 100,000,000 LUC are redeemed by the platform itself from the exchanges at a price of up to $0.05 for 1 LUC during two months, starting from Aug. 15.In order to accelerate the delivery of content from the streamer to the viewer, the creators of Play2Live have implemented Content Delivery Network (CDN) technology on the platform. The CDN increases the upload speed of video, software, game and other digital content in various system access points.The project team also developed a neural network that is able to monitor over 200 streams simultaneously without requiring huge amounts of computer resources. The team has implemented algorithms for real-time monitoring of streaming videos, recognition of complex objects and video content. The neural network is responsible for the fulfillment of assigned tasks as well.Another component of the beta is the testing of the multicasting functionality. At different stages of the launch, several hundred streamers will be connected to the platform and will be providing content for the most popular games. This functionality will be used for broadcasts of esports tournaments.According to Play2Live CTO Vladislav Arbatov, the streaming platform has become safer with the blockchain. ""Thanks to the immense computing power, unpretentious software and distributed architecture, the CDN is extremely resistant to DDoS attacks, which are the most common means of hacking projects,” he said.The company reports that the new blockchain supports 10,000 transactions per second, plus cryptographic keys. “Thus, Play2Live will be the first platform in the world that uses compact devices to provide information protection to the user and ensure the safety of their identification,” commented Arbatov.The team is continuing to invest in their security protocols, Arbatov added. Play2Live is also asking testers to send feedback to help.p2l.tv, aiming at further development.Play2Live already has vast experience in international competitions, as the company organized the ""CryptoMasters"" games in Minsk from Feb. 24 to Feb. 25, 2018. It was the world's first large-scale esports tournament in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, in which the winners received a prize equivalent to $100,000. Competitions were broadcast on the MVP-version of the Play2Live platform in seven languages.Disclaimer. Cointelegraph does not endorse any content or product on this page.
