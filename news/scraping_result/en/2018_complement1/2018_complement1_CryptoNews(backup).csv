","Although the real identity of Satoshi Nakamoto, a mysterious creator of Bitcoin, could well remain a mystery forever, his words are still closely read and religiously followed by many Bitcoin enthusiasts. However, there is an extensive list of forum posts the Bitcoin creator penned while Satoshi still worked on the project that many still follow. Now, the Satoshi Nakamoto Institute has collected those quotes and organized them into topics for everyone to read.","The Satoshi Nakamoto Institute, founded in November 2013, is looking to “learn from the past and build toward the future, through scholarship, community, and coding.” This includes archiving writings, publishing research papers related to the industry as well as sharing ideas and concepts.Some of the quotes include: “Governments are good at cutting off the heads of a centrally controlled networks like Napster, but pure P2P networks like Gnutella and Tor seem to be holding their own.”""Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve. We have to trust them with our privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves drain our accounts. Their massive overhead costs make micropayments impossible.""“A lot of people automatically dismiss e-currency as a lost cause because of all the companies that failed since the 1990's. I hope it's obvious it was only the centrally controlled nature of those systems that doomed them. I think this is the first time we're trying a decentralized, non-trust-based system.”“It's very attractive to the libertarian viewpoint if we can explain it properly. I'm better with code than with words though.”""Yes, but we can win a major battle in the arms race and gain a new territory of freedom for several years."" “Commerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as trusted third parties to process electronic payments. While the system works well enough for most transactions, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model.”""Writing a description for this thing for general audiences is bloody hard. There's nothing to relate it to."" “I would be surprised if 10 years from now we’re not using electronic currency in some way, now that we know a way to do it that won’t inevitably get dumbed down when the trusted third party gets cold feet.”""Bitcoin would be convenient for people who don't have a credit card or don't want to use the cards they have, either don't want the spouse to see it on the bill or don't trust giving their number to ""porn guys"", or afraid of recurring billing.""“Lost coins only make everyone else's coins worth slightly more. Think of it as a donation to everyone.”""It might make sense just to get some in case it catches on. If enough people think the same way, that becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. Once it gets bootstrapped, there are so many applications if you could effortlessly pay a few cents to a website as easily as dropping coins in a vending machine."" ""I'm sure that in 20 years there will either be very large transaction volume or no volume.""“Bitcoins have no dividend or potential future dividend, therefore not like a stock. More like a collectible or commodity.”""How does everyone feel about the B symbol with the two lines through the outside? Can we live with that as our logo?""The project needs to grow gradually so the software can be strengthened along the way. I make this appeal to WikiLeaks not to try to use Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a small beta community in its infancy. ""The requirement is that the good guys collectively have more CPU proof-of-worker than any single attacker.""""The Bitcoin network might actually reduce spam by diverting zombie farms to generating bitcoins instead."" ""We should have a gentleman's agreement to postpone the GPU arms race as long as we can for the good of the network. It's much easer to get new users up to speed if they don't have to worry about GPU drivers and compatibility. It's nice how anyone with just a CPU can compete fairly equally right now."" ""I am not Dorian Nakamoto.""______If you want to read more, head over to the Satoshi Nakamoto Institute to learn about the person (or people) behind all this. And remember: when in doubt, ask yourself: what would Satoshi Nakamoto do?"

______","Will Bitcoin be many times more valuable by 2028?Or will it be mostly dead?Will it be replaced by the more advanced cryptocurrencies that merit our highest Weiss Ratings?If so, will those cryptocurrencies have begun to replace most fiat currencies?Before I can answer these questions about the future, let’s first look back at the past …When Bitcoin was born ten years ago, the world was torn by financial crisis.It was 2008. Major governments had piled up massive debts. Lehman Brothers failed, triggering a chain reaction of even greater failures in the banking system. Governments responded by printing unlimited quantities of money. And Bitcoin was born as Satoshi’s indignant response to the mess they created.The dream: To create a peer-to-peer system of electronic cash, killing three birds with one stone:First, Bitcoin would unshackle money from the control of those who created the financial crisis.Second, it would replace their behind-the-scenes deliberations and manipulations with the first-ever form of money that has a built-in monetary policy.Third, the monetary policy would be stable, predictable and completely transparent — visible to everyone.That was the dream. But it has not been the reality.Bitcoin will more closely resemble a store of wealth (like gold) than a system of electronic cash.Here’s what happened …When Bitcoin creators looked at fiat money, there was little desire to sort out the good from the bad. Instead Bitcoin’s specs were deliberately designed to be the exact antithesis of every critical aspect of existing monetary policy. Specifically …1. Fiat money supply is unlimited and forever expandable. Bitcoin’s money supply is strictly capped and immutable.2. Access to fiat digital money is dictated by banks. Bitcoin is free for everyone and anyone to use as they see fit.3. The fiat money system is made up of multiple gatekeepers and asset custodians that have to be regulated by a central government and trusted by the people. Bitcoin’s code stipulates that there are no gatekeepers, custodians, regulators or governments in the mix. In fact, there’s supposed to be no authority whatsoever.That was the theory. But in practice, these design choices have taken a heavy toll on the Bitcoin network over time:1. Since Bitcoin is scarce, most people are usually reluctant to spend it. Instead, they simply hoard it in the expectation that, with time, its value will always go up.2. Since there is no formal authority, there has emerged an oligopoly of miners who control the minting of most new Bitcoins.3. And since Bitcoin lacks adequate governance rules to select custodians, certain groups of developers have seized control over most of the network’s development.So, with the benefit of hindsight, it’s now evident that Bitcoin was an overreaction to the financial crisis and to the monetary system that allowed the crisis to occur. End result: Instead of functioning as an efficient peer-to-peer system for transferring cash, Bitcoin is evolving into a store of value like gold. But unless dramatic changes are made, that could wind up being its only function ten years from now.What’s worse, if current trends continue, Bitcoin could become an asset that’s mostly mined by an oligopoly of large corporations in the East … but mostly owned by large financial institutions in the West. (See “What might happen if China declared war on Bitcoin?”)The good news: Like gold, Bitcoin still retains the potential to rise dramatically in value. Moreover, the fact remains that Bitcoin introduced the first public, open, digital asset the world has ever seen. Bitcoin was the first successful experiment with Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). And in recent years, that revolutionary technology has evolved rapidly.So, what comes next? Looking ahead to the next ten years, we can see how …DLT could contribute not only to the evolution of money and the stability of monetary policy … it could also enhance economic productivity, political governance, social cohesion and more.DLT could revolutionize democratic elections, transform the world of lending and massively disrupt social media. So, the potential for cryptocurrencies to change the world is big, much bigger than originally expected ten years ago.In fact, whether or not Bitcoin can deliver on its original promise is now a moot point. Other cryptocurrencies are rising to the occasion to fulfill the original dream … plus much more.Yes, the invention of Bitcoin broke the ice.• It unleashed teams of developers and thinkers who are passionate about a decentralized digital cash system, who are fixing the deficiencies of Bitcoin and fine-tuning their algorithms to create a currency for the masses, and …• More recently, it has also unleashed a parallel trend of a very different kind: Regulators and gatekeepers of the traditional financial system see the handwriting on the wall. They have become increasingly aware of the powerful advantages that DLT could bring to the table. And they are already looking for ways to adapt, adopt — or co-opt — the new technology to modernize the existing system.Depending on which of these prevails, there are two possible scenarios on how cryptocurrencies evolve over the next decade:Public open ledgers and their native cryptocurrencies begin to replace the fiat currency system. Instead of saving, spending or investing dollars, euros or yen, people begin to do all of those things with cryptocurrencies like EOS, Cardano, Ripple, Stellar or Holo.A growing share of the population transitions from government-issued currency to public cryptocurrencies. They are attracted to crypto by handy, practical distributed applications (dApps), powered by free and open cryptocurrencies.This activity is not controlled by government or government-regulated institutions. It’s governed by the consensus of each community.Initially, governments resist. But eventually, they accept the new reality. They realize they can no longer control the monetary system the way they used to. Instead of bucking the trend, they begin to recognize these new forms of money as legal tender.No currency emerges as the sole winner. Rather, a select group of cryptocurrencies becomes dominant, thanks to superior technology, the most practical applications and the broadest mainstream acceptance.Governments of the world’s largest economies — the U.S., the European Union, China and Japan — lead the way toward adopting Distributed Ledger Technology. If not, smaller countries take the lead and the larger ones follow. They realize that digital money is the wave of the future. And they see that the single, most-efficient form of digital money is based on DLT.BUT instead of creating open, decentralized systems, they focus on digital money systems that mimic the fiat system already in place. Yes, the technology is similar. But the governance is not: The new kinds of money remain under the direct control of central banks.For political leaders who crave more power and control, it’s a massive upgrade: Government agents gain the ability to directly monitor every single transaction in the system. They are empowered to freeze accounts with a few clicks of a mouse. And once various kinds of property are digitized, a government decree to confiscate assets of targeted groups can be executed in seconds.The technology is still distributed ledger. But instead of opening the network to everyone (a permissionless system), those who wish to join must first get the government’s OK (a permissioned system). And instead of relying on the rules embedded in the code to ensure fairness (a trustless system), participants must accept the authority of the rulers (a trusted system).In a country with strong democratic traditions and judicial protections, this would not be of immediate concern. The government is expected to act in the best interests of the people. It’s assumed it will use its new digital superpowers strictly against rogue actors.But in countries already leaning toward autocracy or with no independent judiciary to speak of, the picture goes from dark to darker: Governments use centralized DLT to snuff out whatever individual freedoms remain.How can two starkly different scenarios be enabled by the same technology?Remember: All technology is inherently neutral. It can be tool of evolution or a weapon of destruction; a blade for harvest or for war.DLT is a prime example. It’s one of the most revolutionary technologies on the planet. It can help enhance individual freedom, guarantee property rights and build wealth. Or, it can be used by authoritarian governments to install a draconian surveillance state.Ten years from now, which will it be? A lot will depend on which scenario prevails: Decentralized DLT or centralized DLT?My guess is that, for now at least, we could wind up with an unholy mix of both. But in the longer term, decentralized DLT will always have two major advantages:First, DLT derives its greatest power from voluntary mass participation. But centralized DLT represses that mass participation. It’s contrary to the essence of what DLT does best.Second, even if governments can create their own form of cryptocurrency that’s fully under their control, it will be almost impossible for them to ban decentralized DLT networks.In the end, the same dynamic that ultimately makes democracies stronger than dictatorships will also make decentralized DLT stronger than the centralized alternative."

September 15, 2018
","Bitcoin's scalability problem is gradually becoming less acute. In August 2017, the activation of the Segregated Witness (SegWit) upgrade began increasing network transaction speeds and lowering transaction fees, while ongoing work on the Lightning Network also promises to make Bitcoin faster by moving certain transactions off-chain.","And now, a new piece of the puzzle is about to fall into place. This is Schnorr, an algorithm that would enable multiple signatures to be securely aggregated into one, thereby increasing the speed and privacy offered by Bitcoin. However, while a technical outline for implementing Schnorr has now been released by developer Pieter Wuille, the need for community consensus and adoption could mean there's still some time to wait before it increases Bitcoin network capacity by as much as 40%.Originally developed by German cryptographer/mathematician Claus-Peter Schnorr, the Schnorr signature algorithm is essentially a way of linking multiple wallet keys to a single signature.""For applications like Bitcoin, one of the most compelling advantages is compact multi-signatures, allowing what are effectively several signatures to be compressed into the space of one,"" crypto-analyst Tony Arcieri explains to Cryptonews.com. 
""The overwhelming majority of the data in Bitcoin's blockchain consists of signatures, so using Schnorr-based techniques to ""compress"" signatures allows for a much smaller blockchain to represent the same cryptographically verifiable information.""""The overwhelming majority of the data in Bitcoin's blockchain consists of signatures, so using Schnorr-based techniques to ""compress"" signatures allows for a much smaller blockchain to represent the same cryptographically verifiable information.""For the uninitiated, cryptographic signatures are how a blockchain protocol (such as Bitcoin's) verifies that a public wallet key corresponds to a private one. They're needed a) to verify transactions and b) to avoid revealing a private key to unwanted scrutiny. Unfortunately, the need to provide a signature for every single wallet involved in a transaction can weigh the Bitcoin network down.Enter Schnorr, which is now a viable solution for Bitcoin due to the introduction of SegWit. This is because SegWit moves all signature data to a separate portion of each block, which allows such portions to have their rules altered without the need for a hard fork.As such, Schnorr can be introduced with only a soft fork, enabling a transaction involving multiple addresses to be reduced to a single signature. While estimates vary depending on who you ask, this simplification will reduce the amount of block storage needed by the Bitcoin network by anything from 25% to 40%.In other words, more transaction info could be included on a single block, and if we assume a current maximum speed of seven or eight transactions per second for Bitcoin, the addition of Schnorr could bring this up to as much as 9.8 or 10.2. Increased capacity would also help to reduce transaction fees, thereby making it cheaper to buy and sell bitcoin.This aggregating of multiple addresses in a single signature will also have a positive effect on privacy, since it will incentivise people to use CoinJoin, an anonymization method for bitcoin transactions, or similar protocols. Previously, this anonymization service suffered from the fact that not enough people used it, something which can actually compromise the anonymity of those who do. But combined with the use of Schnorr, transaction fees will be reduced on the whole if people pool their transactions together, in the process giving people a reason to use the program and increase their privacy.As promising as Schnorr sounds, there's still the question of when it will actually be deployed, and of whether the Bitcoin community will harmoniously arrive at the consensus necessary for adopting it.For example, the proposed SegWit upgrade ultimately led to the hard fork that created Bitcoin Cash in August 2017, since some community members felt that it wouldn't do enough to change how BTC is treated more as an asset than a currency.However, Arcieri for one is sceptical that Schnorr will be controversial enough to cause yet another schism. 
""This is sound cryptographic engineering the community should probably adopt from a purely technical perspective,"" he says. ""I can't imagine what kind of narrative people would spin to argue against it, but we've seen that in the past with what should otherwise be uncontroversial cryptographic improvements to Bitcoin like SegWit.""""This is sound cryptographic engineering the community should probably adopt from a purely technical perspective,"" he says. ""I can't imagine what kind of narrative people would spin to argue against it, but we've seen that in the past with what should otherwise be uncontroversial cryptographic improvements to Bitcoin like SegWit.""And still, even if there is consensual support for Schnorr, its implementation will still rely on users actually choosing to use it, as is the case with SegWit. And given that SegWit enjoyed only 25% usage six months after its launch, it's clear that Schnorr's effect on BTC transaction speeds and fees won't be instantaneous."

","Crypto has long since spread beyond the small tech savvy community into the world, gathering around it enthusiasts from all walks of life. Two new examples lend strength to this claim.","Recently, a new documentary called Bitcoin Girl came out, in which a young woman attempts to live on Bitcoin for 21 days in China - infamous for its dislike of cryptocurrencies. Meanwhile, on the other side of the planet in southern London, two identical twins designed a cryptocurrency in their mother’s kitchen, and now it’s in the top 100 coins by market capitalization.Bitcoin Girl follows a young woman known as He Youbing on the internet, who tries to survive 21 days using only bitcoins in Beijing, Shenzhen, Guangzhou and Shanghai. At the start of her trip on August 28th, she had around USD 1,400 in bitcoins. The experiment included persuading shop owners and strangers to accept bitcoin in exchange for food, accommodation and traditional banknotes, while educating them about the benefits of blockchain. Most of the 15 six-minute episodes of the documentary have been shown so far on iQiyi, a Chinese online video platform.Life on crypto is not easy, the documentary shows. She traveled through Beijing on an unlocked bike from a sharing service, sleeping in a McDonald's, where she dined on free ketchup. There, a college student offered to treat her for a meal at their canteen, adding, “but I don’t want to take bitcoin.” Others don’t even know what bitcoin is. At one point, she fainted due to low sugar levels - friends from a crypto chat group sent her to the hospital and turned out to be the first ones to accept her bitcoin in exchange for some snacks. Traveling further to the southern coastal city of Shenzhen, a crayfish restaurant turned out to be accepting bitcoin. There, a yoga teacher bought some coins from her, so she had enough fiat to spend the night at a hotel. In the latest episode shown on September 15, He Youbing was on her way to Shanghai, the final destination of her 21-day trip, South China Morning Post reports. In the documentary, the producers said they refused the offer of several blockchain startups in China to help fund the experiment. He Youbing adds, “If I fail, then that’s the failure of the blockchain people.”Meanwhile, half the world away, in south London, identical twins Steve and Sam Williams became multi-millionaires by designing Populous (PPT), a coin currently ranked 53rd by market capitalization, with a price of USD 3.13 as of the time of writing. Populous is a peer-to-peer invoice discounting platform that is globalizing what is currently a localized and limited market sector, helping small and medium-sized businesses with cash flow. The founding twins, Steve and Sam, have grown up in a tough neighborhood, learning a lot about what it means to be a victim of crime and how it impacted them.“It filled in some elements that were missing in me and opened my eyes to what could happen to me,” Steve told the Evening Standard in an interview. They both spent four years working on this project from their family home in Brockley, a district in south London. (However, the website of the company mentions Steve as the only founder). Within the first five days of launching in June last year, demand was so strong that the initial batch of tokens was worth more than GBP 8 million (USD 10.51 million), according to the report. This success was also their ticket out of the rough neighborhood: Steve’s six-year-old attends a private school, and their offices are in Mayfair, an affluent area in the West End of London.Populous price chart:Steve studied advanced business, while Sam took a course in computer programming, according to the report. Also, in 2008 Steve was charged and convicted of obtaining money transfers by deception and served 18 months of a three-and-a-half-year jail term.Moreover, Sam has also launched two other crypto coins called Zloadr and DocTailor, aimed at legal professionals, the Evening Standard reported.
___While a life using only cryptocurrencies may still be a long way off - perhaps especially in China - crypto is already offering a new chance to business-savvy individuals. Still, the penetration of both blockchain and cryptocurrencies into different niches is a positive step towards adoption - and if you can sell your bitcoins to one yoga teacher, you might well be set for a while."

November 16, 2018
","USD 5,500 per bitcoin is a good entry point for those willing to buy this most popular cryptocurrency, Jehan Chu, founder of Kenetic Capital, a blockchain investment and advisory firm, said. They have recently revealed that their proprietary investment portfolio has recorded year-to-date returns of 77% against the highly bearish market.","Talking on Bloomberg Daybreak Asia, Jehan Chu said, “I bought my first Bitcoin at USD 900 back in late 2013, and I continued buying all the way down to USD 200. Those of us who have been early in the space have seen this before, so do I think that USD 5,500 down from a high from around USD 18,000-19,000 is a good entry point? I do. [...] As we move forward, Bitcoin and some of the larger cap cryptocurrencies will increasingly be seen as a legitimate store of value, especially in the wake of what’s happening across the globe. And I think that USD 5,500 in a year will be seen as a very cheap price.”Forecasts coming from companies that have managed to record high returns might be worth to listen, especially given that the whole market is down around 65% compared to December 2017. (In either case, it's a healthy thing to take all forecasts with a grain of salt. For example, in December 2017, even Jehan Chu estimated that Bitcoin will reach USD 50,000 by the end of 2018 and confirmed this forecast in January.) The return of 77% is recorded as of October 31st, with two more months until the end of the year. Kenetic Capital CEO Daniel Weinberg explains, “During this volatile period, our proprietary investment portfolio continued to outperform many crypto funds as a result of our deep institutional investment experience and strong risk management.”As to whether Bitcoin can go back to where it was around a year ago, Chu says, “I think we will see a significant turnaround, both in the blockchain space, as well as in the indicative prices of major assets including Bitcoin, Ethereum and other major large-cap cryptocurrencies [...] This past year we saw ICE, the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange, launch Bakkt in conjunction with Microsoft and Starbucks. So we’re really seeing these blue chip brands entering the space. And I think that’s having a positive overall effect on the enthusiasm and the comfort of the asset.”His opinion on entry points for Bitcoin is shared with some others, notably Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic advisor at Allianz, an insurance giant. Around two months ago, El-Erian said that bitcoin is best bought at USD 5,000 - a reiteration of his previous stance from June. However, El-Erian “doesn't expect it will get all the way back to USD 20,000.”However, some market analysts still do not rule out that the market might continue falling.

_________","Wall Street’s so-called “experts” are creatures of habit. They behave in patterns that are as predictable as the tides.When a market soars into bubble-land, they pour out of the woodwork to cheer the “powerful fundamental forces” that are driving prices higher.When the bubble inevitably bursts, they scramble to predict its demise.And precisely when a brand-new bull market is in the making, they pronounce its last rites.Rarely is this pattern as clear as in cryptocurrencies, a much-maligned asset to begin with.Just today, I found two strident Bitcoin eulogies. One refers to the “mother of all bubbles.” The other says that there’s no future in crypto.Neither mentions that both the market and the market analysts are subject to the same cyclical pattern that repeats itself regularly:Bitcoin enjoys a massive bull market, culminating in a frenzied parabolic surge of speculation — the period we call “the climax.”It comes crashing down as speculators beat a panicky retreat.It consolidates for months, creating a dead zone of sideways action or further decline, from which only the diehard survive.And it launches a new bull market, repeating the cycle — again culminating in a blast-off climax.But here’s the key:The story begins in September 2010, just eight years ago, when Bitcoin was trading at close to 6 cents. Today, this same asset is trading at around $7,000 per token, a return of over 11 million percent.No, the path from a half-dozen cents to thousands of dollars isn’t easy. Nor is it a straight line. But that’s the whole point: It happens in a cyclical pattern and that cycle is ultimately predictable.Bitcoin begins the cycle with a powerful but non-parabolic rise — from 6 cents to 80 cents by April 2011. Until this point, the rise is driven mostly by Bitcoin users and long-term investors who understand the technology and share the vision of its founder.Then, suddenly, average investors begin to pile in. But the market is still minuscule, extremely illiquid and unable to accommodate crowds. So prices go ballistic: Bitcoin literally blasts off to the stratosphere, surging from 80 cents to a high of $36. (See blue-highlighted area of chart.)The crash follows immediately thereafter, as Bitcoin plunges by 93%! Much like today, naysayers re-emerge — ranting about the “a failed experiment,” raving about “the death of Bitcoin.”But it never trades below $2. So …Even at the ultimate bottom of the crash, investors who bought at the beginning of the bull market cycle sit on gains of 38 times their original investment. Like in the prior bull cycle, Bitcoin enjoys a very solid run from its $2 low to about the $10 level, up fivefold.Long-term buy-and-hold investors (nicknamed the “HODLers”), who bought early in the prior cycle, are delighted. But anyone who joined the prior cycle during the frantic run-up to $35 is still frustrated.The frenzy returns in early January. The king of cryptos breaks out above $13 and starts accelerating to the upside once again, exploding to a nosebleed bubble high of $260 in April 2013.Total rise from bottom to peak: about 13,000%! But again, the overwhelming bulk of the move is jammed into just two short months, from February 2013 to April 2013.The bust strikes with even-greater fury. In less than a week, Bitcoin is back down to $50 by April 15 — an instant 80% crash!And as usual, the “Bitcoin-is-dead” crowd dominates the headlines.But as in the prior bull run …Even at rock bottom, anyone who bought near the beginning of this cycle is sitting on an asset worth five times their original investment.As before, the recovery from the April low of $50 is initially slow, reaching the $100 level by Oct. 1, 2013.And as before, it’s the last two months that deliver the giant price explosion — to $1,160 by December, a surge of 1,160%.Irrational exuberance infects not only average investors, but also the media, which sings the praises of crypto … until, that is, the next bust strikes, ushering in Bitcoin’s longest bull market to date:From its $1,160 high made in December 2013, Bitcoin plunges to a low of $150 by January 2015, an 87% decline.The bear market is so long and so deep, Bitcoin evangelist Andreas Antonopoulos says he’s worried about the future of crypto.But as before …Even at the bottom, investors who bought at the beginning of the cycle still have tripled their original investment.Moreover, this point is also the beginning of the greatest Bitcoin bull market of all time …It takes Bitcoin a couple of years to recover from its great bear market of 2014.Then, the big action begins in 2017, as Bitcoin launches a solid move from roughly $1,000 in January to about $5,000 in October.As in the three previous cycles, however, it’s not until the last two months of the bull run that the public jumps in with both feet. Prices rise like a rocket. Bitcoin surges to its high of nearly $20,000 by December.And of course, the crash inevitably followed — taking Bitcoin down to $5,800 on Feb. 6, 2018, a 70% decline.Many analysts, not personally familiar with the prior bull cycles, argue as if this is somehow “a new phenomenon.”But as you’ve clearly seen, it’s anything but.It’s déjà vu. And for the third time!If history is any guide …    • The first few months of the next bull cycle could be slow and choppy. Don’t expect prices to explode suddenly. But this will be the ideal time to invest.    • The core of the bull market will be solid but not parabolic. A good time to add steadily to your holdings.    • It’s not until the final blow-off phase that you will see Bitcoin make new all-time highs and rise parabolically. Time to take most of your money off the table in phases.    • The next crash is bound to wipe out at least half of the gains. But as before, early investors will still come out ahead. Even those who just HODL should be sitting on some fat profits.Some analysts may think the ups and downs in Bitcoin are just an endless merry-go-round. But the fact is, with each bull cycle, the cryptocurrency markets are also evolving and making progress toward a more mature phase, ushering in three major changes.With each cycle, especially the most recent one, a wide variety of new cryptocurrencies have been introduced — several with far more advanced technology and use-cases. We’ve seen the introduction of Ethereum and smart contracts … the emergence of Ripple, Stellar, NEO, EOS and Cardano … and soon, Hedera Hashgraph.Consequently, the climactic phase (the last two months) of the bull cycle is becoming relatively less extreme.    • In the climax of the first bull cycle (ending June 2011), Bitcoin shot up 4,500%.    • In the climax of second bull market cycle (ending April 2013), the rise was 1,300%.    • In the climax of the third cycle (ending December 2013), prices increased 1,160%.    • And in the climax of the fourth cycle (through December 2017), Bitcoin surged by 400%.Before 2010, all trading was over the counter. In 2013, only one exchange existed. And in 2014, the biggest exchange, Mt. Gox, failed. But the consequence was the birth of dozens of new, more secure exchanges. And today, there are 206 operating exchanges, according to CoinMarketCap.com.Stepping back from the trees, it’s clear that the best days of cryptocurrencies are yet to come.From a fundamental standpoint, engagement in cryptocurrencies has never been greater. The infrastructure and underlying technology are in the best state that they’ve ever been. In the long term, there’s only one way to go from here: onward and upward."

October 29, 2018
","The world’s oldest surviving Bitcoin exchange, Bitstamp, has been bought by NXMH, a Belgium-based investment company. This represents yet another example of traditional investors moving into the cryptocurrency industry - a recent trend that has been on the uprise throughout 2018.","Bitstamp CEO, Nejc Kodrič, writes in the official announcement, “Bitstamp has been regularly approached by suitors for quite some time. The reason why we finally decided to sell the company is a combination of the quality of the buyer, the quality of the offer and the fact that the industry is at a point where consolidation makes sense. A major factor in agreeing to the sale is that the mission, leadership and vision of the company remains the same.” Through the purchase, NXMH acquires an 80% stake, while Kodrič retains a 10% ownership interest in the exchange, according to Reuters. Pantera Capital Management LP, which made a USD 10 million investment in the company in 2014, also sold part of its stake in Bitstamp to NXMH, the report added.NXMH, with assets under management of more than EUR 2 billion, is the European subsidiary of South Korea-based NXC, which invests in digital technologies. NXC also owns South Korean cryptocurrency exchange Korbit and Nexon, a South Korean gaming company. Back in April this year, the exchange had been rumored to be in talks with Nexon regarding the acquisition. Nexon Korea CEO Lee Jung-hun denied the rumors that pegged the price of the exchange at around USD 350 million. In 2016, Bitstamp was valued at USD 60 million, Kodrič told Reuters today.Kodrič stresses that nothing about Bitstamp’s services will change: “We do anticipate that this acquisition will strengthen Bitstamp’s positioning for growth, which will provide opportunities to better serve our customers. Customers should not have any concerns about their accounts or changes to the way we operate,” he adds.Bitstamp was founded in 2011 in Slovenia by Kodrič and Damian Merlak. However, Marlek sold his entire 30% stake in Bitstamp with the deal, and has not been active since 2015, according to Reuters.The registration of the company was moved to the UK in April 2013, then to Luxembourg in 2016. The company was founded as a European-focused alternative to then-dominant bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox. While the company trades in US dollars, it accepts fiat money deposits for free only via the European Union's Single Euro Payments Area, a mechanism for transferring money between European bank accounts.Top markets on Bitstamp:As traditional investors are moving into the space with increasing frequency, this seems to be the boost many companies need: after the Singapore-based BK Global Consortium bought a controlling share in South Korean cryptocurrency exchange Bithumb, trading shot up by some 25% over the following weekend. Japan is another example of this trend. Coincheck was taken over by financial services company Monex earlier this year after falling victim to a hack in January, with another financial sector company, Fisco, set to complete the takeover of last month’s hack victim, Zaif, late next month, as Cryptonews.com previously reported. “Major companies are likely to continue targeting [exchanges] for a while yet,” wrote Japanese business media outlet M&A Online in an editorial piece."

October 31, 2018
","Yesterday, bitcoin price moved into a bearish zone below the USD 6,400 support level. BTC/USD is currently consolidating above the USD 6,300 level, but there are a lot of bearish signs visible on lower timeframe charts. Equally, ethereum is trading below the USD 200 support with a negative bias, which could spark a fresh decline towards the USD 180 level. ","Other major altcoins like dash, bitcoin cash, neo and litecoin are struggling to recover. They are trading near yearly lows and remain at a risk of more losses. LTC/USD is currently trading well below the Oct 31, 2017 low of USD 56.00 and just above the US 47.80 yearly low. It seems like litecoin could decline further to trade to a new yearly low below USD 47.00 if it continues to struggle. Similarly, dash, neo and bitcoin cash are down and trading well below levels seen one year ago on Oct 31, 2017. More importantly, if sellers remain in action, these coins could accelerate declines and trade to a new 2018 low in the near term.Total market capitalization After yesterday’s decline bitcoin price  found support near the USD 6,300 level and later started consolidating losses. BTC/USD is currently trading above the USD 6,330 level with an immediate resistance at USD 6,360. However, main hurdles for buyers are USD 6,380 and USD 6,400, above which the price might move back in a positive zone.
On the other hand, if the price fails to recover, it may perhaps slide back towards USD 6,300. Any further declines will most likely push the price towards the USD 6,250 support area.Ethereum price  is currently consolidating losses below the USD 200 level. ETH/USD seems to be preparing for the next decline if buyers fail to push the price back above the USD 200 and USD 202 resistance levels.
On the downside, an immediate support is at USD 195, below which the price could trade to a new monthly low. The main support for buyers on the downside is near the USD 180 level.Bitcoin cash price  is struggling a lot below the USD 430 level. It seems like BCH/USD may continue to slide and it could break the USD 400 handle as well to form a new yearly low. 
Ripple price  is slowly declining towards the USD 0.440 support. If XRP/USD fails to stay above the USD 0.440 support, sellers may well gain strength to take the price towards the USD 0.420 level. On the upside, resistances are seen near USD 0.450 and 0.455.Despite the current market sentiment, a few small cap coins traded higher between 6%-12%, including dentacoin, chainlink and pivx.
Overall, bitcoin price is slowly approaching key supports like USD 6,250, below which there is a risk of a sharp decline. If buyers continue to struggle, there is a possibility of a larger downward move in bitcoin, ethereum, ripple, bitcoin cash, litecoin, dash, neo and other major cryptocurrencies.

November 14, 2018
","The crypto market might lose millions in trading volume in the coming days due to the scheduled hard fork of Bitcoin Cash, (BCH) the fourth largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, as a number of exchanges will pause deposits and withdrawals to minimize customer disruption. Moreover, some of BCH owners might not be able to access their coins for an unspecified time.","Coinbase, the US-based exchange and wallet provider, announced that they will be pausing all BCH trading, as well as disabling any withdrawals of BCH from Coinbase and all associated services for the time being: ""If you wish to have access to your BCH during the pause, you will need to remove it from the Coinbase platform prior.""“Due to recent developments, we have now determined that it will be necessary to also pause all buys, sells, and trading of BCH starting at 8:00AM PST on Thursday on Coinbase.com, in the iOS and Android apps, and on Coinbase Pro and Prime,” the company said in a blog post. As for how long the pause will go on, the blog post explains, “We cannot predict the duration of this process. When the upgrade is complete, we will evaluate the security and viability of the network and take appropriate next steps, including re-enabling sends, receives, and trading. We will update our customers throughout the upgrade process and about the outcome of the fork once the network reaches consensus.”The decision to freeze all BCH-related business will mean a lot of frozen funds, for a lot of people. Combined figures from Coinbase Pro, Binance, Huobi and OKEx (all of which are suspending BCH deposits and withdrawals during the fork for an unspecified time) are showing almost USD 400 million in BCH trading volume in the last 24 hours.At the time of writing, the total 24-hour BCH trading volume exceeds USD 1 billion, while the price crashed by almost 9%. The community is generally not too happy about the trading suspension. In reply to the announcement by Coinbase, cryptocurrency investor and Twitter influencer WhalePanda tweeted: ""Hey guys this smooth ""protocol upgrade"" doesn't seem to be going that smooth after all."" Well at least they still warned people 36 hours in advance... I doubt they're actually ready in case people start messing with the ABC chain though.https://t.co/Ym6DOcDBVHPreviously, Binance, Coinbase and other exchanges have announced their support for the Bitcoin ABC proposal as published on bitcoincash.org. However, as Coinbase noted, ""unlike previous BCH hard forks, there is a competing proposal [Bitcoin SV] that is not compatible with this published roadmap.""Bitcoin ABC is the “mainstream” proposal supported by bitcoincash.org, while Bitcoin SV – short for “Satoshi’s Vision” – is backed by the self-proclaimed Satoshi Nakamoto, Craig Wright and a group of BCH miners.""It should be clear that as confusing as the Bitcoin Cash hard fork may seem, especially for beginners, it is unlikely to have any significant impact on the broader crypto industry, are very slim. However, this drama is a lot of fun to watch and a great exercise for people to increase their knowledge and understanding of how these things work,"" Mati Greenspan, Senior Market Analyst at eToro, a social trading platform, said earlier this week. According to him, the end result will most likely be a split in the network resulting in two different versions of Bitcoin Cash when both upgrades go into effect this Thursday."

September 24, 2018
","If you are reading this article, you know what the blockchain is. What you may not know, however, is that so-called “sidechains” also exist in the distributed ledger ecosystem. ","To enlighten you, you will discover what sidechains are and what impact they could potentially have on the future of cryptocurrencies. The concept of sidechains was first introduced in 2014 in a paper titled ‘Enabling Blockchain Innovations with Pegged Sidechains’ written by a team of developers who later went on to form the blockchain startup Blockstream. In simple terms, a sidechain is a separate blockchain that is linked to the main blockchain through what is referred to as two-way pegging, which enables digital assets to be interchangeable between the two chains without jeopardizing their performance or speed. Sidechains are being developed first and foremost to address the issue of blockchain scalability but also to potentially add new functionalities to a blockchain, such as introducing smart contracts for the Bitcoin network, for example. To transact on a sidechain a bitcoin user first has to send his or her coins to an output address, where the coins are being locked so that the user can then spend them elsewhere. Once this transaction has been completed, a transaction confirmation is communicated across the two chains followed by a short waiting period for security reasons. Once the waiting period is completed, the equivalent number of bitcoin is released onto the sidechain, allowing the user to then access and spend the coins as he or she pleases. To put coins back on the main chain, the reverse transaction needs to take place. Everyone who has used bitcoin in late 2017 will remember the excruciatingly high transaction fees that peaked at an average of over USD 50 per transaction in mid-December. This occurred because the Bitcoin blockchain could not accommodate the number of bitcoin transactions that the late-2017 bitcoin gold rush caused. As a result, transactions suddenly took hours to process and high fees made bitcoin unuseable as a spending currency. In anticipation of this scaling challenge, Bitcoin developers have started to work on sidechains with the belief that they can provide the much-need relief for the Bitcoin blockchain to ensure that the digital currency can survive as its adoption continues to grow globally. Through the creation of sidechains, much larger transaction volumes can be processed as the main blockchain is relieved of its burden. Hence, a functioning network of sidechains could potentially give blockchain technology the ability to scale to a commercial level. Having said that, sidechains have not yet been implemented into Bitcoin network as issues such as security and centralization still need to be addressed before we can start spending our bitcoins using sidechains."

","Doing your own research before investing money in any kind of endeavor is of critical importance. The chance to lose everything is much higher when you don’t know exactly what you’re doing. Investing in cryptocurrencies can be all the more daunting for the fact that they’re relatively new and mostly unregulated, and there is no central authority you can go to in order to ask everything you wanted to know.","This is why crypto baskets exist: if you’d rather not handpick among thousands of coins, various platforms offer the possibility of buying a so-called basket which includes a select array of coins. In most cases, they are weighted against the market: this means that the percentage of market dominance is also often the percentage the coin makes up in the bundle. This means that when you buy a bundle that includes, for example, Bitcoin and Monero, you will get significantly more of Bitcoin than of Monero due to their respective market capitalizations.Cryptonews.com brings you a collection of nine crypto baskets, launched by 5 five platforms this year, for a better overview of what’s in the market, what you’d be interested in and what potential drawbacks they have.CollectionsProvider: Circle Invest
Basket Options: four baskets (Platforms, Payments, Privacy and The Market)
Tokens within Basket: Platforms: four; Payments: four; Privacy: two; The Market: eleven;
Overview: Circle has been trying to make it as easy as possible to get started with cryptocurrency trading, and Collections is supposed to make it easy for anyone, even complete “noobs,” to purchase cryptocurrency. The Market is a bundle with which, in one tap, you can buy all the coins on Circle Invest, weighted depending on their respective market capitalization. The others are grouped according to their purpose. This means that Monero will belong to Privacy, while Bitcoin is in Payments, etc. 
Points of Interest: Geographically restricted (only for the US); initial transaction as low as a single US dollar.
____BundleProvider: Coinbase
Basket Options: one basket;
Tokens within Basket: five: Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Ethereum Classic;
Overview: The Coinbase Bundles work very similarly to Circle’s Collections in that they are weighted according to each coin’s share of the market - they are available in different ratios based on the market capitalization and price at the time of purchase.
Points of Interest: Geographically restricted (to the US, EU and UK); the smallest Coinbase Bundle available is USD 25, GBP 25, or EUR 25; limited purchase according to verification limits.
____BIT10Provider: Abra & Bitwise
Basket Options: A single index 
Tokens within Basket: the top 10 coins by market cap that also meet quality criteria (liquidity, security, and robustness requirements), rebalanced monthly;
Overview: The BIT10 is based on the traditional model of index investing. It is supposed to widen access to cryptocurrency investing by simplifying the experience of gaining exposure to a large part of the crypto market, and minimizing barriers to entry. Using Abra’s stablecoin model,  BIT10 positions are held in multi-signature smart contracts on the Bitcoin or Litecoin blockchain. Once invested, Abra and the user enter into a smart contract that effectively pegs the asset invested (either fiat currency or cryptocurrency) to the same amount of BIT10 tokens. While the token is built on Bitwise's index fund, it is not an exchange-traded fund (ETF).
Points of Interest: USD 5 minimum investment; no restrictions on entry or exit timing; no fees; no geographical restrictions.
____HB10Provider: Huobi 
Basket Options: a single index;
Tokens within Basket: 10 coins that are listed on Huobi and have the higher market value, larger scale and better circulation to reflect the overall performance of Huobi Global's market;
Overview: By exchanging for HB10, users can hold HB10 Index. Users can have the opportunity to exchange for a basket of corresponding digital assets so that they can invest in several currencies, which can help to provide users with a risk-distributed and diversely targeted tool for long-term digital asset exchange.
Points of Interest: exchange fee decreases with exchange value (up to none at all after USDT 1 million); allocation method explained in-depth on the company’s website; HB10 can be exchanged with BTC, ETH, HT (Huobi Token) and USDT.
____OK05/OK06Provider: OKEx
Basket Options: two: OK05 and OK06;
Tokens within Basket: five within OK05, six within OK06;
Overview: OK05 and OK06 are indices that both follow the top 5 coins by market cap, with the difference that OK06 adds a sixth coin to its collection: OKB, the official utility token of OKEx. To qualify for the OK05, tokens are required to have been listed on OKEx for longer than 90 days; to be an open-source project; to be in the top 10% by 30-day average trading volume in USDT market; must be decentralized and cannot be a security. All coins from OK05 are automatically eligible for OK06 with the addition of OKB, which serves to reflect the performances of the most important tokens on OKEx. The index is rebalanced weekly. 
Points of Interest: minimum subscription/redemption quantity is 100 units; both subscription and redemption are completed within an hour; there is no subscription fee, but the redemption fee is 0.2%."

Meanwhile, Austria with the population of almost 9 million and 229 ATMs is the leader among larger countries. In the case of protectorates such as Saint Kitts and Nevis or Anguilla, we did not count them as independent countries - since they’re not - but added them to their respective countries. This means that, although those territories have a small population, they did not make the list, as they were considered, on the whole, as the UK (or Netherlands in the case of Aruba).Also, if Hong Kong, the special administrative region of the People's Republic of China, would be an independent country, it would also secure a place among Top 10, as it has 28 crypto ATMs. Although the low population count in many of these examples skews the image of cryptocurrency adoption, it is still worth noting that adoption exists even in those places that are not in most news headlines. After all, as we see here, Djibouti has a better ATM per capita ratio than, for example, Australia.Take note, big countries.In either case, the number of crypto ATMs in the world is rising steadily, and that they're enjoying increased usage from customers. Still, the legal status of crypto is preventing their growth from being as impressive as it could be, while stubbornly high fees are placing a limit on customer usage.

","After a successful advertising campaign of eToro, a multi-asset platform which offers both investing in stocks and cryptocurrencies, Ripple, a California-based crypto start-up focusing on the banking sector, is trying to get their minute of fame. ","The startup has just published a new ad, and they’re mocking the outdated financial system by showing that it would be both easier and faster to get on a plane and deliver money directly. The ad shows a woman bringing money to a bank, and the teller getting dressed, boarding a plane, climbing mountains and navigating rivers and jungles to find the recipient and give them the money. “Global payments are fragmented. Ripple connects,” the ad concludes.Comments on the YouTube video are disabled, so the community took to Twitter to share their opinions about the ad. “I think this should be a Super Bowl commercial,” says user @cryptografix, while others are asking whether the ad will be televised. However, others stress that the ad is not talking about the XRP, the native token of Ripple: Yeah, but the point is to make sure crypto has a mainstream platform to present its use case to the world.In either case, the ad is already garnering attention, with more than 65,000 views on Twitter and more than 5,000 views on YouTube.Meanwhile, on Reddit, user u/LOSFan4 even says the idea for this commercial came from him! “For context: 68 days ago I posted here suggesting that Ripple make a commercial where they demonstrate how it’s faster to fly money around the world,” he says, linking the post that garnered some attention even back then, with close to 400 upvotes and 116 comments. “I’m picturing a video commercial where the point is a race to deliver money. Someone leaves Ripple’s NY office with a backpack full of cash, while someone else sends an electronic payment via SWIFT to someone in London. First person to get the money to London wins. You show the person flying to London, delivering the cash, going on a short holiday (seeing the sights, etc), flying back to NY, while the SWIFT money STILL hasn’t settled,” u/LOSFan4 wrote back then, adding, “Part 2 of the commercial is the same race, but it’s physical delivery vs xRapid. Basically the guy carrying cash doesn’t even get to the elevator before he’s lost the race.”Whether or not they got the idea from this Reddit user, the ad is just the latest in Ripple news: last week, the company said that they saw revenue from the sale of the digital asset XRP more than double this past quarter compared to the second quarter of 2018. The Q3 2018 XRP Markets Report states that they sold USD 163.33 million in XRP, up from USD 75.53 million in the second quarter.Also, a few weeks ago, Ripple announced that three clients have moved from pilot-testing to full commercial use of Ripple’s xRapid product, which uses the cryptocurrency XRP as a liquidity vehicle for cross-border payments.Back then, Alistair Constance, CEO of MercuryFX, UK-based payment provider, told Fortune that the company used xRapid to send a several thousand dollars in small denominations to a charity in Mexico. According to the CEO, the payments were made in two minutes at a cost of ""not even a couple cents,"" while sending USD 1,000 via SWIFT international payments network it would take 2-to-3 days to settle and cost up to USD 75."

","Crypto is no stranger to anonymous founders. Bitcoin's Satoshi Nakamoto was effectively anonymous, and the received wisdom says that this enabled the original cryptocurrency to develop organically, without its evolution bowing to the disproportionate weight of a single authority figure.","However, whether it's October's Oyster exit scam, or the infamous BitConnect Ponzi scandal from earlier in the year, anonymous founders have been recently earning themselves a bad reputation, with anonymity seeming to function only as a way of enabling fraudsters to escape with loot.But as Bitcoin proves, some cryptos with anonymous principals are legit, and there are signs of credibility investors can look for when confronted by a 'faceless' new coin.First made public in September 2017, the Oyster Protocol (PRL) was promoted as a way of monetizing data- and file-sharing on the internet.It garnered enough of a following to reach a market cap of nearly USD 230 million by the beginning of January, although it plunged by 98% by August, to a cap of less than USD 4 million.It was, in other words, already in trouble, and the private decision of its anonymous founder – 'Bruno Block' – to tweak its smart contract in order to take PRL for himself only confirmed its demise.And by perpetrating this exit scam, Mr 'Block' highlighted one of the main drawbacks of having an anonymous founder. Because his actual real-world identity wasn't associated with the Oyster project, he personally felt less pressure to work towards restoring it to its former glories and making it a success.More seriously for investors, his anonymity also led him to the belief that he could exit without suffering repercussions, just as it did with BitConnect and LoopX.Another major con of having a nameless creator relates to governance.For example, given that 'Satoshi Nakamoto' hasn't been active in Bitcoin since late 2010, the cryptocurrency's community has occasionally suffered from problems when it comes to reaching consensual decisions, as seen with the whole scaling debate and Bitcoin Cash hard fork from 2017.Matthew Green – a cryptography professor at Johns Hopkins University – told CNBC in 2017, ""Very few major decisions that would surprise people or are controversial actually get made. That's both [a] strength of Bitcoin, because it's very static, and it's also a weakness, because it can't react and develop new features the way that other systems can.""Anonymous founders, however, bring at least one benefit. That is, anonymity provides founders with the freedom to launch new cryptocurrencies without suffering negative repercussions, whether from repressive governments or employers who don't like the idea of an employee attracting the 'wrong' kind of publicity.""An anonymous founding team offers no additional benefits for a decentralized currency,"" Daniel Schwartzkopff – the CEO of Invictus Capital, a crypto investments company – explains to Cryptonews.com. ""A centralized cryptocurrency, however, may be the target of law enforcement if it violates any securities and exchange control laws and so an anonymous team might avoid having the currency shut down.""""The main reason why I didn't publicize that I worked for Google previously is because I didn't want to make it seem like Google endorsed Litecoin or Bitcoin in anyway,"" said Charlie Lee, the creator of Litecoin, in 2013.And by protecting themselves from unwanted scrutiny, founders allow themselves to build up their fledgling coins, while retaining the option of later unveiling themselves when their projects gain traction and become 'serious' (as TAU Coin founder David Wu, or 'iMorpheus', did in September).Even if anonymous founders can sometimes be justifiable, would-be investors still need to exercise extreme caution when approaching new coins, particularly if participating in an initial coin offering (ICO).As Phil Zamani, the CEO of data blockchain AERGO, tells Cryptonews.com:""My advice to an investor coming across an interesting new crypto project with an anonymous founder would first be to ask the reason for the anonymity […] If after this you don't feel like this is something special and believable - move on!""Daniel Schwartzkopff agrees, adding the point that if the blockchain is decentralized enough to run without the founder, it's likely to be a safer bet than one that requires the founder's benevolence. ""I would strongly recommend that they avoid interacting completely unless it is a true, decentralized currency with its own blockchain. If you are not very technically adept and are doubtful if it does, in fact, meet this requirement, rather err on the side of caution and avoid it."""

","The Armenian government has presided over the opening of what it claims is one of the biggest cryptocurrency mining farms in the world. At a ceremony in the capital, Yerevan, acting Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan was joined by the head of the consortium that has constructed the farm, Armenian billionaire (and so-called oligarch) Gagik Tsarukyan.","Per news outlet Yerkramas, Tsarukyan claims that the farm, which is the brainchild of his Multi Group conglomerate, cost some USD 50 million to construct, and has been equipped with an initial 3,000 mining rigs. The company is planning to expand that number to 12,000 in the near future.The farm will initially mine Bitcoin and Ethereum. Yerkramas states that the facility is based on two floors: the ground floor is a business and management center, with an entire floor given over to servers and equipment above.The media outlet says that Tsarukyan and Pashinyan – who tendered his resignation from his post two days ago in a bid to call snap elections – were joined by business leaders from China, South Korea, the United Arab Emirates and “a number of other countries” for the opening ceremony.Tsarukyan is quoted as saying, “Guests are coming to Armenia from almost 40 countries [to see the mine]. This is an important step towards the development of the information technology sector in Armenia, especially since representatives of foreign business circles are planning to meet with members of the government to discover more about the possibilities of making new, larger investments in the Armenian economy.”The farm will initially receive some 50MW of power from a thermal energy plant, with “an agreement in place” to provide an increase in capacity to 200MW, per Armenpress.Watch this video from the opening of the farm:Earlier this year, the country’s government legalized mining in anticipation of the farm’s opening, although cryptocurrency trading remains illegal in Armenia. The country says it is planning to create a Free Economic Zone for overseas crypto and blockchain companies – in the vein of Belarus’ Hi-Tech Park and Kazakhstan’s Astana International Financial Center."

","Banks in Panama, which is one of the Top 20 countries by crypto ATMs per capita, appear to be refusing cryptocurrency transactions, per media reports, sparking fears that a crackdown has begun.","Per newspaper La Estrella de Panama, “a handful of users” have claimed that their bank accounts – and those of their cryptocurrency-trading acquaintances – “were closed upon [the banks] learning that they traded in cryptocurrencies or just for having [crypto holdings].”Trading in cryptocurrencies is not illegal in Panama, a country with the population of 4 million, but the newspaper stated “it seems that the financial sector has gone from caution to rejection.” Crypto community leaders bemoaned the fact that their relationship with the banks “has been very, very complicated” so far.The newspaper says it has been in touch with several banks in the country, which have all so far chosen not to respond on the matter. It quotes Felipe Echandi, co-founder of Panama Fintech, a Panamanian blockchain community and pressure group, as stating, “I don’t work with cryptocurrencies personally, but I do know of cases where [banks have refused to deal with clients involved with cryptocurrencies].”Echandi added, “Unfortunately in Panama, in the case of fintech enterprises, it is very complicated for banks to open accounts. I had to go explain my own business model 50 times to different banks.”The country’s banking regulator, the Superintendency of Banks of Panama, has previously warned the public about the “risks” associated with trading in cryptocurrencies, stating that government regulations do not cover the exchange, purchase, sale or investment of digital tokens.The lack of regulation in the crypto and blockchain space, especially for projects that raised funds through initial coin offerings (ICOs), is keeping even compliant projects from working, as previously reported by Cryptonews.com. Some projects eve complain that ""If you’re a good citizen complying with accounting, opening bank accounts, doing everything correctly, you can still get hit every single week by institutions, service providers, partners that tell you they’re not working with you anymore just because you’re dealing with cryptocurrencies.""

","Cryptocurrencies are gaining popularity fast in Colombia – with developments coming apace in the field of commerce, education and overseas investment.","Activity on LocalBitcoins, a peer-to-peer bitcoin marketplace, just reached new all-time heights with BTC 350 traded last week. Meanwhile, the Dash cryptocurrency, which recently reported that it had signed up “more than 100 new Dash merchants in Colombia in the last three months,” this week announced that it was allocating some USD 300,000 worth of funds for growth projects in Colombia and neighboring Venezuela. Dash is thought to have a total of almost 29 communities in the two countries.Also, DiarioBitcoin reports that a large, newly formed community of Colombian cryptocurrency miners and blockchain companies named FEDE-MINERS wants to petition the government to deregulate mining and convince lawmakers to consider the financial and technological benefits of pro-blockchain policies.Although the Colombian government is currently mulling the introduction of crypto-specific taxes and regulations, while the country’s biggest exchange has been hit with a banking freeze-out, recently elected president Iván Duque Márquez, is known to be an avid fintech enthusiast, and has spoken favorably about cryptocurrency usage in the past.Moreover, the country’s biggest university, the National University of Colombia, has announced that it has begun a month-long “blockchain and cryptocurrencies” introductory course, which runs until late November this year, and is open to members of the general public.Also, as reported, the country’s biggest star, footballer James Rodriguez, has recently launched his own digital token, and domestic “unicorn” e-commerce platform Rappi, which has branches elsewhere in Latin America, recently announced it would begin accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment."

","This summer, it emerged that Tommy Robinson – the former leader of the far-right English Defence League (EDL) – had received GBP 20,000 (USD 26,300) in Bitcoin donations following his imprisonment for contempt of court.","The episode appeared to confirm the mainstream view that BTC, and crypto more generally, is more the preserve of the hard right than it is of anyone on the left or the centre ground, not least because everyone from Richard B. Spencer to the Daily Stormer website has received donations in cryptocurrency.However,  as the following interviews and reporting will show, the reality is that cryptocurrencies appeal to a broad political constituency. They have the potential to reshape society in a way that makes it more open, less hierarchic, and more democratic, and to this extent they find support across the full political spectrum.""Just looking from the outside in, almost everyone would say that a lot of the bitcoin community is libertarian,"" Bitcoin core developer Bryan Bishop tells Cryptonews.com. ""This is partly because the libertarian community was somewhat early to adopt bitcoin and get interested. In addition, when Bitcoin whitepaper was originally published by Satoshi Nakamoto, he posted political messages against banking and in favor of privacy, anonymity, and cryptography.""Jason Rosenstein, the CEO of blockchain-based art platform Portion, agrees that crypto appeals to libertarian believers in minimal state intervention. He tells Cryptonews.com, ""Cryptocurrency enthusiasts seem to have a libertarian political view and mindset."" However, Rosenstein's comments point to the complication that, even within libertarianism alone, people stand along a spectrum, and may not necessarily be right-wing in any simplistic, uniform sense. ""Generally speaking, crypto traders may be financially conservative but socially liberal.""Indeed, this complex view of Bitcoin's political makeup is furthered by other commentators, who note that crypto is malleable enough to serve a variety of political convictions. ""Users of cryptocurrencies tend to reflect the attitudes of the culture in which they reside,"" says Will Roman, co-founder and CEO of the LXDX crypto-exchange. ""Countries which are more technology forward, have a high gaming culture, and have been using virtual currencies for decades are predisposed for cryptocurrency adoption by even the most conservative members.""Conversely, Roman explains that, even in areas and countries that lack advanced technological infrastructures and that may be more left-leaning, Bitcoin still holds plenty of attraction. ""The adopters of cryptocurrencies from locales that hold a skeptical view and have no mass familiarity with the exchange of digital assets tend to hold more contrarian outlooks.""While ""contrarian"" is vague enough to potentially cover a wide range of ideologies, there's evidence to show that more leftist (and centrist) groups are also taking to crypto.""I believe that cryptocurrency holders and traders could be not channelled in the traditional scheme or right and left,"" says Francesco De Santis, the CMO of crowdfunding platform Bloomio. ""However, I believe there is a strong correlation with new political movements fostering 'the change' vs. the traditional system."" As an example, De Santis highlights the championing of blockchain by Italy's 5-Star Movement, while another example comes from England, where the Labour-led Hull City Council funded the launch of the HullCoin cryptocurrency in 2014 (for use with/by charities). But more generally, most observers affirm that crypto has been broadening its political outlook recently, since we’re realising that it has implications for us all. ""You're just as likely to see a headline about how the Chinese government intends to use blockchain technology as you are about the Libertarian angle,” says Mich Hagen, the CEO of dapp platform Mainframe. “Anybody interested in the use of broad power, or resistance to it, will have an interest at this point.""On the one hand, the idea that crypto is 'right-wing' is undermined by how it's currently ""experiencing a slight shift towards the centre of the overall political spectrum,"" as explained by Lisk’s (a blockchain application platform) Thomas Schouten. On the other, it's also undermined by how, if cryptocurrencies and blockchains were to gain universal adoption, the resulting world wouldn't necessarily fit with the aspirations of the (extreme) right.""Used as intended, cryptocurrencies will unquestionably foster a more egalitarian world,"" says Hagen. ""Cryptocurrencies have the potential to bring economic participation to the unbanked and the underrepresented across the globe. This is also apparent in regions such as Catalan, where protestors are actually utilizing Mainframe’s decentralized technology to circumvent government censorship.""""A primary benefit of blockchain technology for various use cases is to disintermediate the middlemen in the value chains and to promote peer-to-peer behaviours,"" says Michael Smolenski, the CEO and founder of Lightstreams, a blockchain for dapps. “We could then see the unbundling of many centres of power, especially with the dot-com entities that dominate today. One could see this as a more liberal world.""Others, however, are somewhat less optimistic, and even if they certainly don't think crypto will make the world veer strongly to the right, they think it will most likely reinforce existing power structures and inequalities.""In the end, I doubt that there will be much change,"" predicts Angel Versetti, the CEO and co-founder of decentralised IoT platform Ambrosus. ""Even if the technology is objective and trustless, the people behind it are not.” Somewhat depressingly, Versetti argues that the majority of new crypto startups are established by people from big finance and business, implying that the values of the latter will be increasingly transplanted to crypto.“Would those people want change in the world? No. They only want to make money from it, and they will, and this will create the same [political] barriers."""

","Jeffrey Berns is a cryptocurrency millionaire who wants to build a community in the Nevada desert, USA running completely on Ethereum. Instead of government and big corporations in control, the blockchain-based city would put power in the hands of the people and use cryptocurrency as the coin of the realm.","One of the designers of the community is Tom Wiscombe Architecture, and the description of the project reads, “The city aims to showcase how business development, residential living and commerce can flourish alongside world changing technologies [...] Multiple innovative technologies will change the way its residents interact on a daily basis and blockchain technology will be at the center of it all - keeping systems honest, fair and democratic.”The area planned for the city is made up of 67,000 acres (27,115 ha) of land, dubbed “Innovation Park” by Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval. It surrounds an industrial park where Tesla's Gigafactory is located, as well as buildings that major tech giants like Google and Apple own. The New York Times reports that the property was bought for USD 170 million by the company founded by Berns, Blockchains LLC. Berns’ investment in Ethereum back in 2015, which is still the most profitable initial coin offering, is what’s funding the whole project.Why Nevada? Berns tells NYT that this is mostly due to tax benefits, including the lack of income taxes. Why build it in the first place - given that no such feat has yet been done with this technology? “Something inside me tells me this is the answer, that if we can get enough people to trust the blockchain, we can begin to change all the systems we operate by,” he said.The city is envisioned to be split into two parts: a residential area and campus for researching emerging technologies. According to the website, the business part will feature “a highly secured, high-tech Blockchains Campus that joins blockchain technology with artificial intelligence (AI), 3D printing and nanotechnology,” as well as a university. The commercial side is focused on encouraging technologically forward ideas and development. The tech campus will feature an e sports arena as well.The residential area will feature a smart city with homes and schools, with self-driving cars, as well as a drone delivering system. The city should run on renewable energy and be community-oriented. Berns said the company won’t begin construction on the broader property until late 2019, at the earliest, after putting together the master plan and getting it approved by the county.“This will either be the biggest thing ever, or the most spectacular crash and burn in the history of mankind,” Berns said. “I don’t know which one. I believe it’s the former, but either way it’s going to be one hell of a ride.”______Watch Jeffrey Berns presenting his company’s vision on how they plan to leverage blockchain technology to impact humankind:"

","Bitcoin price gained bullish momentum against the US Dollar and Tether (USDT) during the past few hours (UTC 08:20 AM). There was a sharp upward move in BTC/USDT above the USD 7,500 level due to a nasty slide in Tether below the USD 0.950 support. BTC/USD also gained traction and surged above the USD 6,500 and USD 6,700 resistance levels. However, buyers failed to hold gains and bitcoin price reversed most of its gains. BTC/USD is back to USD 6,600 and it is currently trading with a positive bias. Similarly, ethereum, bitcoin cash and ripple rallied recently before trimming most of their gains. Overall, the recent price spike ignited a lot of volatility in the crypto market, which could help bitcoin buyers in the short term.","Total market capitalization After testing the USD 6,200 support, bitcoin price  started an upward move. BTC/USD broke the USD 6,350 and USD 6,400 resistance levels to climb sharply higher. It even spiked above the USD 6,850 resistance, but sellers quickly reversed the bias. 
The price declined sharply and traded below the USD 6,700 level. It is currently trading near the USD 6,600 mark, with an immediate support near the USD 6,500 level. The most important support on the downside awaits at USD 6,400. On the upside, the price needs to regain the USD 6,700 level to climb back towards USD 6,800.Ethereum price  broke the USD 200 resistance zone to enter a positive area. ETH/USD climbed above the USD 205 and USD 215 resistance levels.
The price also traded above the USD 220 level, but later it declined below USD 215. It is currently up 5% to USD 211, with an immediate support at USD 210. On the upside, buyers need to settle the price above the USD 225 resistance for further gains.Bitcoin cash price  rallied above the USD 450 and 475 resistance levels during the recent upward move. BCH/USD tested the USD 490-500 resistance zone, which prevented further upsides. The price is currently down to USD 462 and it may well continue to trade lower towards the USD 450 support.
Ripple price  surged above the USD 0.450 resistance and even spiked above the USD 0.465 level. Later, XRP/USD reversed gains and it is currently trading near the USD 0.445 level. It seems like a proper close above the USD 0.450 level is needed for a larger upward move.Many altcoins gained traction and moved up between 7%-20%, including komodo, DROP, holo, bytecoin, BTG, DGD, MOAC and NPXS.Overall, the recent upward move in bitcoin price seems like a false spike, but as long as BTC/USD is holding the USD 6,400 support, it could climb higher once again. Similarly, if ETH/USD stays above the USD 210 level, the pair may possibly retest the USD 225 resistance.

","After Coinmine, a Coinbase, among other investors, backed crypto tech startup, introduced Coinmine One, a device capable of mining cryptocurrencies, it hit a wall of criticism due to the low mining profitability it offers. However, it might be only the beginning of the new wave of the crypto tech for the general public and another step towards the mass adoption.","At this stage, the device might provide a hassle-free solution for people who seek to get into crypto mining and earn some coins on the way. Now it can mine cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, Zcash, and Monero. However, at the time when mining profitability is going down, it might be not a good idea to buy a USD 799 device in order to make 2 dollars per month (also, there is a 5% fee.) (In comparison, the same device would have made around USD 200 in January this year, when the ether price stood at almost USD 1,400. Now the price stands at USD 178.) Some people reacted: “Mine at a loss from the comfort of your own home!”Moreover, the company collects the mined coins and stores them on wallets powered by Coinmine’s central servers.However, the startup rushed to defend its product that starts shipping in December, by saying that “this is not just a miner, but a general purpose crypto device that just happens to include a GPU [graphics processing unit] miner” and adding that “what you buy today will not be what you have in the future.”For starters, the company plans to add more coins that could be mined on this device. Also, they promise that two new features are coming “soon.”According to their website, users will be able to send and receive payments on the Lightning Network, earning routing fees in with their bitcoin. Furthermore, Coinmine stated that their users will also be able to participate in the Proof of Stake networks where they will be able to “effortlessly” stake cryptocurrency right from their mobile device. In this case, instead of using hardware to mine, users “stake” their currency to the validity of transactions. In return, they earn interest on the tokens they have staked.______In either case, Coinmine is not the only company that is making crypto mining accessible for the general public. For example, bitcoin mining rig manufacturer Canaan Creative has reportedly come up with a creative new way for ordinary people to mine bitcoins by using their TV sets.Also, there is a heater that, when you turn it on, passively mines your cryptocurrency of choice while doing its original job in heating up the room.Moreover, there's a desktop app, Honeyminer, that helps the average Joe with a consumer-grade computer mine cryptocurrencies."

","Music has always been a popular way of self-expression, and if you really wanted to, you could probably find a song about literally anything online. This, of course, means that there are songs about crypto. From boasting about how rich you got by trading crypto to songs shilling a certain coin, saying that the songs vary in quality would be a big understatement. ","Cryptonews.com assembled 10 music videos related to crypto. Be warned though - some of these are simply so bad that they’re good.

October 05, 2018
","Cryptocurrencies that focus on the privacy of their users - or, simply, privacy coins - have drawn the interest of many different people, all with a single priority: nobody should know how they spend their money. Bitcoin may not be as anonymous as most people think, but there is a number of coins focusing on that issue first and foremost. Oftentimes, privacy coins are considered the ones that truly follow original Bitcoin ideas about anonymity and decentralization.","However, not all of them are decentralized or even completely anonymous. They all have their strengths and weaknesses, and figuring out exactly what you need - and how they fit into that - is your first step towards finding the coin you want. Here, we will take a quick look through the top five privacy coins by market capitalization, their attributes and points of interest. You may want to note that “cryptographically private” means that the ways of maintaining privacy have been built into the product by ways of cryptography. This makes it impossible for someone to track your transactions as there is no way for them to know that it is your transaction to begin with - an important point to consider when choosing a privacy coin.Market Cap: USD 1.9 billion (October 4)
Rank: 10th (by market capitalization)
Privacy: cryptographically private
Decentralization: decentralized
Overview: Considered the most secure and anonymous privacy coin in the market today, Monero enables users to hide the amount of digital cash they send and receive, the source of the funds, the recipients, and the amounts held in their wallets. It is cryptographically private by default, utilizing several privacy features – most prominently being stealth addresses and ring confidential transactions (RingCT).
Points of Interest: Mining centralization is a possible weakness; the coin’s popularity on the dark web gives it a bad reputation; a possible plus is that the coin has a dedicated hardware wallet.Market Cap: USD 1.5 billion 
Rank: 12th 
Privacy: not cryptographically private; privacy through mixing
Decentralization: partially centralized
Overview: Dash promises privacy through mixing, utilizing a modified version of CoinJoin – a method initially created to “anonymize” Bitcoins. Dash functions similar to Bitcoin, in that the blockchain is transparent by default while offering optional privacy by way of mixing. A masternode is required to expedite the mixing process, which in turn requires users to trust that the server is not recording details on where each user’s outputs are ending up.
Points of Interest: Masternode network makes it semi-centralized but allows it to include innovations like InstantSend, PrivateSend, and the Dash Budget System; not completely trustless as there is nothing keeping the masternodes from recording details; takes seconds to confirm a transaction.Market Cap: USD 645 million 
Rank: 21st 
Privacy: cryptographically private; but not private by default (meaning you have to turn privacy ON, otherwise the transaction is public)
Decentralization: partially centralized
Overview: Zcash leverages the Zerocoin protocol and zero-knowledge proof cryptography called zk-SNARKs to provide financial privacy to its users by enabling them to hide information about the sender, the recipient, and the transaction amount. At the basic level, zero-knowledge proofs allow to prove that the information you are sending to the other party is true, without having to broadcast said information besides the fact that it is true.
Points of Interest: Creating a shielded transaction is computationally heavy (although an upcoming hard fork promises to solve this issue almost completely); unshielded transactions can, in some cases, leak information about shielded transactions.Market Cap: USD 232 million 
Rank: 40th
Privacy: not cryptographically private; privacy through Tor browser, used by many to protect their online identity, and I2P routing
Decentralization: decentralized
Overview: Verge only offers “privacy” by way of Tor and I2P routing, to obfuscate traffic and conceal a user’s IP address when transacting. There are no cryptographic privacy features with regards to the blockchain, the linkability and traceability of transactions and addresses, nor the concealment of the amounts being transacted. The coin also lost its credibility in early 2018 after experiencing two 51% attacks.
Points of Interest: the 51% attacks are considered a big drawback in security; there have been network promises and underdeliveries by the team that were considered unprofessional.Market Cap: USD 124 million 
Rank: 52nd 
Privacy: cryptographically private; but not private by default
Decentralization: partially centralized
Overview: Komodo uses zero knowledge proofs to provide its users with financial anonymity. Aside from offering increased financial privacy through its digital currency KMD, the Komodo platform also offers the launch of decentralized ICOs (dICOs), a decentralized exchange, and blockchain development solutions, among other services.
Points of Interest: Scalability solution called Peerchains, where sibling chains (different assetchains) on the KMD platform can form a network of blockchains which operates on its own and doesn’t bloat the Komodo blockchain; interoperability between different blockchains; passive income, where holding your tokens in a KMD wallet generates you 5% KMD annually by just sending your coins back to your address; however, the community is quite inactive."

","Given the erratic, unpredictable behavior the cryptocurrency market can sometimes exhibit, people moving to crypto-trading for the very first time may be forgiven for thinking that no conventional trading strategy is particularly effective.","However, this assumption is mistaken: even though cryptocurrencies are generally more volatile than many other financial assets, experienced traders affirm that certain strategies are indeed applicable to crypto. And in fact, some experts even believe that all trading strategies are just as applicable to crypto as they are to other assets, which aren't as different from Bitcoin and other coins as beginners might initially suppose.""I believe in something called 'portfolio science,'"" Lou Kerner – a founding partner at venture capital firm CryptoOracle – tells Cryptonews.com. ""[This] says you allocate a percentage of your assets to crypto, and then buy a basket of market weighted assets, on a regular basis (monthly, quarterly), and not worry about prices. Over the long run, that's how you maximize returns.""Kerner is referring here to modern portfolio theory (MPT), which originated from a 1952 essay by American economist Harry Markowitz.In its simplest form, MPT involves investing in a range of assets whose price movements are uncorrelated. Because they're uncorrelated they tend not to fall and rise together, thereby lowering the investor's exposure to individual asset risk and saving him or her from making an overall loss.And as Kerner suggests, if the investor chooses their spread of assets (including cryptocurrencies) carefully, they may enjoy stronger returns over the long term. For example, a 2017 study conducted by researchers at Bocconi University in Italy suggests that MPT is the optimal strategy for crypto-trading, at least when compared to a 'Bitcoin-only' strategy and one which weights a number of different coins equally (i.e. that includes an equal amount/value of each coin).However, the key point to make here is that the use of MPT cannot generally be confined solely to the crypto-market.That's because cryptocurrencies are too highly correlated with each other at the moment, as can be shown by the table below. When one slips so do the vast majority of the others, thereby exposing investors to greater risk.As crypto-trading analyst Alex Krüger tells Cryptonews.com, there is one promising trading strategy for those who want to stick solely to cryptocurrencies.""Breakouts,"" he affirms. ""Cryptos are very directional. Breakouts work much more consistently than for other asset classes.""The breakout trading strategy rests on the assumption that, when the price of a cryptocurrency (or any other asset) 'breaks' through its usual support or resistance level, it has most likely begun a new price trend.For those unfamiliar with these terms, the 'support' level is the price which, in the past, an asset generally hasn't fallen below. Conversely, the 'resistance' level is the price above which an asset tends not to rise, since historically traders have usually wanted to sell at such a level.If a cryptocurrency drops or rises above one of these levels, then it may be a good idea to go short on it (in the case of drops), or to go long (in the case of rises). In other words, it might be profitable to invest in it before this emerging trend hits new support or resistance levels.Of course, while the tendency of cryptocurrencies to 'breakout' of support/resistance levels potentially makes them ripe for this strategy, cryptocurrency trends have been noticeably short-lived. For example, Bitcoin broke through the 'resistance' level of USD 8,000 on July 24, only to fall below this level on July 31, undermining the notion that it had really begun a new trend.Since breakouts are happening all the time in the crypto-market, they tend to unfold and end more quickly than with other assets, implying that traders should be very quick on their feet if they want to take advantage of them.While MPT and breakouts are perhaps the two most popular trading strategies for crypto, many crypto-analysts believe that most or all conventional strategies are still relevant.""No. Everything is applicable,"" says Alex Krüger, when quizzed on whether there are any strategies that aren't applicable to cryptocurrencies. This may seem like an overly optimistic response, but he argues that the crypto-market isn't fundamentally different from other, more 'conventional' markets.""Trading cryptos is what trading commodities used to be in the 70s and early 80s,"" he says, and in this respect his sentiments are echoed by Lou Kerner.""As an asset, crypto isn't different, it's new,"" he says. ""New comes along all the time. Junk bonds used to be new. It was really volatile then. Most investment banks said it was a scam and they would never trade junk bonds. Forty years later, it trades just like everything else. That's crypto in forty years too.""What this means is that other common strategies may also be fruitful for crypto. This is includes day trading, which involves buying and selling assets within a single day. It includes position trading, which involves using price charts and other data to determine the longer term trend of a market, and usually requires investors to HODL onto coins for longer. And it also includes scalping (i.e. arbitrage), which involves profiting from the difference between maximum bid and ask prices for certain assets, so that investors can buy low and sell high.These strategies (and others) are open to new and more advanced traders alike, but as with all things in crypto and non-crypto trading, there is sadly never any guarantee of profit."

","The popular US-based fiat-to-crypto exchange Coinbase has launched support for the new up-and-coming stablecoin USD//Coin (USDC), issued by Circle. ","Starting today, Coinbase customers in supported jurisdictions can buy, sell, send, and receive the USDC stablecoin. The advantage of a blockchain-based digital dollar is that it's easier to send, use in decentralized apps, and store locally. Get started: https://t.co/O6tgs8tMxz pic.twitter.com/NN2NLY4gwEIn a blog post, Coinbase said it is the first time they have ever added support for a stablecoin, while listing up benefits of the USDC, including improved send and receive functionality between wallets, convenient use in decentralized applications (dapps), and an easier way to store value than using physical US dollars.Speaking at the Money 20/20 conference in Las Vegas on Tuesday, Coinbase president & COO Asiff Hirji said that the new stablecoin is “backed one to one with the US dollar, completely audited, completely transparent.”USDC price chart:USDC is a token created on the Ethereum blockchain, which means that it can be stored on, and transferred between, any wallets that are compatible with Ethereum’s popular ERC20 token standard. The new stablecoin is issued by Circle, a crypto start-up that has gained recognition and backing from financial giants like Goldman Sachs. Earlier this month, Chinese crypto exchange Huobi announced that it had also added support for USDC, among other stablecoins like the Paxos Standard (PAX), TrueUSD (TUSD), and Gemini Dollar (GUSD). Moreover, the exchange recently announced their own stablecoin HUSD.Stablecoins war:For a long time, Tether (USDT) has been the dominant stablecoin in the cryptocurrency market. Following recent controversies, however, it appears as if it is now facing some serious competition from a range of players in the market.Largely because it has failed to provide conclusive evidence to back up its claim that all Tethers in circulation are backed by US dollar reserves, the stablecoin has been trading at a discount across most crypto exchanges that supports it for most of October.

","USD//Coin (USDC), a cryptocurrency recently released by crypto startup Circle, retains the right to blacklist addresses and freeze funds should they decide they are being used for illegal activities. The community is outraged and many are looking for stablecoin alternatives to USDC.","However, the situation is similar in some other stablecoins: both Tether and TrueUSD have clauses that say they reserve the right to refuse service to anyone they want to, without any explanation. The only coin that doesn't seem to have such a user agreement is DAI, by Maker, which is why many social media users claim to be switching over to it.Now, back to USDC, in Section 14, titled “Risk Factors & Disclosures” in its User Agreement, Circle states that, “Circle reserves the right to ‘blacklist’ certain USDC addresses and freeze associated USDC (temporarily or permanently) that it determines, in its sole discretion, are associated with illegal activity or activity that otherwise violates the terms of this User Agreement (“Blacklisted Addresses”).  In the event that you send USDC to a Blacklisted Address, or receive USDC from a Blacklisted Address, Circle may freeze such USDC and take steps to terminate your USDC Account. In certain circumstances, Circle may deem it necessary to report such suspected illegal activity to applicable law enforcement agencies and you may forfeit any rights associated with your USDC, including the ability to redeem USDC for U.S. Dollars.”""Reserves associated with USDC balances held on blacklisted addresses may be wholly and permanently unrecoverable,"" Circle explained on its website. Ardon Lukasiewicz, CEO of crypto advisory firm Upholder.io, reacted:Is this really the future of crypto? I'm sure they had no choice, being an American company and all, but this is not good. https://t.co/8iPeveyjjFReddit users, meanwhile, are warning that this is the exact reason Bitcoin exists: “It's almost like we should just keep our money in bitcoin... in our own wallet with our own private keys…” writes u/InquisitiveBoba. However, the Twitter user who discovered the ""the Section 14"" added: It's not inherantly bad. It's just that the risks/caveats should be made fully transparent and I don't think @coinbase has done that. So it's our job to inform people.That said, this is just a risk that people have to take into consideration when using a stablecoin.Of course, this backdoor goes against the decentralized policy of cryptocurrencies, and the libertarian politics that have spawned Bitcoin in the first place. The community is rankled at the thought that someone else effectively has more power over their funds than they themselves do. However, this turn of events could be the price users have to pay for the security of a Goldman Sachs-backed stablecoin. When this stablecoin’s trading was announced, Reddit user @tradingroomapp, a developer of trading strategies for institutional investors, wrote on Twitter, “USDC is Goldman Sachs backed @circlepay stablecoin. I will feel much safer holding USDC vs tether (on relative terms). Don’t be surprised if USDC takes a large market share from tether in short period of time.”"

","The crypto industry just used an old way to reach masses: invite a TV star, make a funny video and hope it will go viral. And this time it really did went viral, spreading the word about the world of cryptocurrencies: almost 2.5 million views on YouTube and Twitter in less than two days.","eToro, a multi-asset platform which offers both investing in stocks and cryptocurrencies, released an ad featuring actor Kristian Nairn, better known as the character Hodor from the record-breaking TV series Game of Thrones. Kristian Nairn portrays the beloved character Hodor, the simple-minded servant of a noble house in the TV show Game of Thrones, who can only say the word Hodor which, in turn, gave him the name. The character spends a significant amount of time carrying a young boy on his back in the show, communicating only with that one word, which is derived from the phrase ""hold the door"". The ad follows the actor listening to offers for advertisements in which he always carries something on his back and says “Hodor.” Tired of being pigeonholed, he tells his agent to find him something “with a tie”. Well, the result is below:The community went absolutely wild over the advertisement. Nairn’s character was universally beloved - the episode featuring a significant plot twist involving Hodor’s past and future which brought fans to tears has been universally acclaimed as well as receiving a 100% rating from review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes. The choice of character, the play on words and the simple message of the ad had fans in a frenzy.“Thanks @eToro for proving that advertisements can be funny again,” writes Twitter user @FleitzPierre, while user @CryptoPoland adds, “A serious actor who reminds us the ads can be more engaging, funny and enjoyable, all at the same time.” Other people are finding more easter eggs in the ad: “Anyone else notice the elevator buttons? Moon or Rekt,” writes Reddit user u/jaynemesis. Then, there are those speculating on other characters of the show and the ways they’re leveraging the world’s economy to serve their own goals… But that does not really have much to do with Hodor.The platform might well have struck gold with this ad in terms of the future of crypto advertising: integrating terms unique to the cryptoverse into pop culture could serve to familiarize wider audiences with the industry.

","Hurun Research Institute’s annual China Rich List was just released yesterday, and it shows that crypto wealth has made an impact even at the very highest levels among China’s “new rich,” with several well-known personalities from the cryptoverse featured on the list for the first time.","As many had expected, the top spot on this year’s list was secured by Alibaba Group founder Jack Ma, with a net worth of USD 39 billion. Although not a crypto entrepreneur, Ma has repeatedly stated that he is a keen observer of blockchain technology (while he call’s Bitcoin a bubble), and Alibaba has previously experimented with implementing blockchain in its food supply chain.The 32-year-old co-founder of the bitcoin mining giant Bitmain Technologies, Jihan Wu, was officially named the richest person in China born after 1985, with an estimated net worth of around USD 2.3 billion. He was accompanied on the list by Bitmain co-founder Micree Zhan Ketuan, 39, with an estimated net worth of around USD 2.4 billion. Bitmain is well-known for its ability to essentially print money, with Wu revealing in June that his company brought in roughly USD 2.5 billion in revenue last year alone. The hardware maker and bitcoin mining pool is now set for one of the largest initial public offerings (IPOs) in the history of the blockchain industry as it prepares to go public on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.However, Bitmain’s main competitor, Canaan Creative, was not far behind either, with founder Zhang Nangeng also securing a spot on the list, although not in the top 100. Canaan Creative recently announced that they are challenging Bitmain with a new bitcoin mining machine that is set to ship out in the 4th quarter of this year.Ultra-rich exchange tycoons were also featured on this year’s list, with Chinese-Canadian Zhao “CZ” Changpeng, 41, founder and CEO of the major crypto exchange Binance, ranked third among people from the crypto industry, with an estimated personal net worth of USD 2.2 billion, according to the report.Famous bitcoin whale Li Xiaolai also appeared on the list, with an estimated net worth of around USD 1 billion. The controversial investor recently made headlines after he was secretly recorded during a private conversation, trash-talking other famous crypto investors and calling them “idiots.” However, in September Li Xiaolai announced that he personally will not invest in blockchain projects in the future as he plans to spend several years to contemplate on his career change."

","When he was talking about Bitcoin in front of his family, Google CEO Sundar Pichai was surprised to have his 11 year old son pipe up to say that what he actually means is Ethereum, “which is slightly different.” ","The boy used the chance to reveal to his father that he is mining ether on their home PC - one that Pichai built himself, he said at the New York Times DealBook conference last week.With the sudden rise in technology over the past three decades, many people belonging to younger generations have found themselves having to explain simple concepts like social media or just using the PC to their parents and grandparents. However, it is probably safe to say that teaching your parent who is a CEO of a tech giant is a very rare occurrence - and that Pichai’s son saw a one-in-a-million chance and took it.Meanwhile, according to Business insider, Pichai said he did have to explain to his crypto-minded son the nation’s monetary system “and how paper money actually works.” He adds, “I realized he understood Ethereum better than how paper money works. I had to talk to him about the banking system, the importance of it. It was a good conversation.”The youngest generation is often beyond their parents in terms of new technology, it seems. Google co-founder Sergey Brin, currently president of Google’s parent company Alphabet, went through something similar with his own son. “A year or two ago my son insisted that we needed to get a gaming PC. I told him if we get a gaming PC we have to mine cryptocurrency. So we got an Ethereum miner on there and we’ve been making a few pennies and dollars since,” he said at a Morocco blockchain conference in July, adding, “That definitely got me interested and I started to study the technology behind it and found it to be fascinating.”Also, a German teenager made his fortune trading Bitcoin. He said he believes that you can still become a millionaire, adding, “I say if you do not become a millionaire in the next 10 years, then it’s your own fault.” Thanks, kid. Here’s to learning from new generations.

","Right now there’s a huge branding problem for blockchain companies in general and many projects suffer from a lack of credibility, Alexa Narma from ODEM’s Marketing and Communications said in an interview with Cryptonews.com.","According to her, this perception about the technology and its operators causes a headwind for anyone in the blockchain space. However, ODEM, a developer of an on-demand education marketplace on the Ethereum blockchain, is already in closed Beta testing of its platform and education portal. The startup, that raised ETH 7,000 during it’s token sale, expects that its platform will be fully deployed to offer academic programs and blockchain certificates in the first quarter of 2019.It’s a platform for the educators, students and service providers in the education industry to participate in a decentralized, real-time and direct marketplace. It aims to empower the participants to search, select and purchase educational products and allow them to negotiate, request and create customized education experiences in-person as well as online. Read the interview about the general state of their project and how it could look like once it goes live below.What are the biggest challenges that ODEM is trying to overcome?Right now there’s a huge branding problem for blockchain companies in general. Many projects suffer from a lack of credibility. This perception about the technology and its operators causes a headwind for anyone in the blockchain space. Establishing ourselves as a top project with a dedicated team, and a clear path to success is difficult when so many groups want to see you fail or have a preconceived notion that none of our work is “real.” It’s dark halo effect that we push back against on a daily basis.For what it’s worth, anyone thinking about starting a crypto/blockchain project should think very deeply about how bad actors can pollute the industry and affect the livelihoods of people who are doing the right thing.I’d say our biggest challenge is building trusted lines of communication and creating positive momentum between educational institutions that have historically been competitors. There are many layers of approval and alignment that must happen to achieve success. Many incumbents are stuck in their ways and view any sort of change as a problem. That’s not the reality of what we’re doing at ODEM. We’re changing that perception and transforming inertia into forward momentum.In your opinion, how will traditional educational institutions respond to such projects as ODEM? It really depends on if a university’s leadership regards blockchain technology as a transformative way of delivering education or if they view it as a threat to their core-business model. We’re seeing some universities react negatively. However, the majority are welcoming and are beginning to create curricula focused on the technology. Regardless of how they react, we know there are many institutions that need a leg-up and are turning to blockchain as a way of shaking-up dated learning systems.If you look at the education landscape, there are many distressed universities out there that have suffered because of “Big Ed’s” stranglehold on student financing. Compounding the problem are regulations that cause runaway administrative spending. If these schools shut their doors, students and alumni suffer the most - their degree is depreciated because the legacy of their institution has been compromised. These outcomes are disgraceful and unfair to students who began their educational journey with the hope of creating a better, more fulfilling life for themselves, their families and their communities.Regardless of the environment for individual universities - ODEM will be able to capture opportunities by building bridges between educators and students. We look forward to more universities approaching us for help.What other blockchain based projects are your main competitors?We’ve been watching several projects in the blockchain/education space that are working on individual components of education systems. Some are focused on leveraging big-name schools to improve their marketing visibility, while others are taking a strictly technological view of the education system. We assume they’re doing quality work, but we know our approach is more holistic and inclusive for a number of reasons.Our sister company Excelorators Inc. has developed and offered student and executive courses for six years, while recently expanding into new projects, including ODEM and blockchain programs. We’ve served thousands of students, and worked with hundreds of educators in executive education, advanced learning programs, and developing programs designed  for international students who want the first hand experience of attending classes located at some of the premier universities in the United States. Being a blockchain company is a natural progression as we expand our core business capability.We haven’t seen any other blockchain companies with the operational experience that we have with in-person educational programming.     When is your project set to become profitable?From the very beginning we will have profitable revenue models. Full profitability will come by the end of 2021. However, we anticipate that any profit we earn between now and then will go towards research and development until we reach a majority of adopters at scale.Odem price chart:_____ODEM is not an online-education platform, but a marketplace. How do lessons and exams take place?Our platform is being built to facilitate in-person education experiences and issue certificates because it is our core competency. We will be offering blended learning programs and building features for real-time remote tutoring. Our research shows that in-person classes combined with online learning have a huge impact on learning outcomes for students. Speaking for ODEM, our goal isn’t to change an educator’s pedagogy (method of teaching), but to help maintain the quality of programs. Just like the traditional education system, curriculum development and exams are administered by the teacher. We are working with seasoned educators to develop best-practices for educators who are new to the platform and planning the use of AI [Artificial Intelligence] technology for student assessment and testing.Who can become an educator? What is the process?We regard most subject-matter experts as educators. Our target audience for the platform is a combination of industry experts and professors across a broad range of topics - from Autonomous Driving Cars to the Hospitality Industry. Educators will be both credentialed and non-credentialed.To help non-credentialed educators, we will offer a rating system for all students to score their academic experiences with them. We are currently working on other mechanisms that will further ensure the quality of educators and the safety of all the students.The sign up process will be similar to a student registration but more rigorous.  Identity verification and background checks are mandatory. Work history, teaching credentials, certificates, diplomas and consensus verification will be requested and stored on the blockchain.Educators will provide the testing in the classroom for all students. Our technical roadmap includes developing a suite of tools to assist educators in creating curricula among other key integrations. Our goal with those features is to link measurable learning outcomes directly to the issuance of education certificates.Who sets the price of a course, you or the educator? How can a student determine if the price is fair or not?This is what it’s all about. Our staking and bidding model allows educators to price their education programs. The platform will have a suggested pricing based on current market rates and conditions. Students will have the ability to negotiate with the educators through an online bidding system.Can you give us a step-by-step explanation of the process that students will follow to start using ODEM? Are there any restrictions, geographical or otherwise, as to who can use it?Each student will create their own education profile with background information, identity verification, academic history and interests. It will be very similar to applying to attend a traditional school. Once the student verifies their profile, they will have access to a library of educators and topics to choose from. Once the student finds a course that interests them, they will stake it using the ODEM token. When the smart-contract requirements for the program are met, the student will be notified about the program specifics, date, time, location, etc. If you have more questions, there is a built-in messaging system that connects you with the educators and coordinators. You can learn more about education program staking on YouTube.

September 26, 2018
",Institutional investors and new crypto startups are increasingly becoming interested in development of stablecoins that may solve one of the main problems for crypto adoption - price volatility.,"Design of a stablecoin allows to keep a relatively stable price of this asset. They are most useful when trading cryptocurrencies: instead of relying on HODLing onto the volatile nature of other coins, you can trade in stablecoins instead of fiat. If you’d like to look above simple trading, think of stablecoins as replacements for fiat in terms of stability, with features of cryptocurrency.Currently, most people in the cryptoverse have heard about Tether and perhaps also TrueUSD, but what about others? We have made an overview of five stablecoins, biggest by market capitalization, highlighting the attributes of each. Market Cap: USD 2.8 billion (September 26)
Rank: 8 (by market capitalization)
Type: fully collateralized, backed by USD
Overview: USDT is a cryptocurrency asset issued on the Bitcoin blockchain. Each USDT unit is reportedly backed by a U.S. Dollar held in the reserves of the Tether Limited and can be redeemed through the Tether Platform. To prove that the amount of USD in the bank account is the same or more than the USDT in circulation, Tether Limited publishes the bank account balance on its website’s Transparency page.
Points of Interest: first major adopted stablecoin, available on most major exchanges, but also a lack of real transparency, no official audit has been done, accusations of lack of funds.
_______Market Cap: USD 94 million
Rank: 67
Type: fully collateralized, backed by USD
Overview: TrueUSD is a USD-backed ERC20 stablecoin that is fully collateralized, legally protected, and transparently verified by third-party attestations. It uses multiple escrow accounts to reduce counterparty risk and to provide token-holders with legal protections against misappropriation. It uses TrustToken’s smart contracts to ensure 1:1 parity.
Points of Interest: uses escrow accounts (centralized by nature), but the TrustToken framework ensures the legitimacy of the process. However, it is significantly less available than USDT.
_______Market Cap: USD 55 million
Rank: 94
Type: fully collateralized, backed by ETH
Overview: Dai is a stablecoin issued by MakerDAO, which also created the MKR token. DAI is set to be a decentralized stablecoin that will react automatically to changes in the market in order to stabilize its price against other types of currency. Despite being backed by ETH, the cryptocurrency’s value mirrors the value of the USD currency.
Points of Interest: no third party involvement, backed by crypto instead of fiat but this opens the possibility of a black swan event (where ETH price crashes well below the one-to-one collateralization ratio in a time frame too short for the system to handle.)
_______Market Cap: USD 10.9 million
CoinMarketCap Rank: 310
Type: fully collateralized, backed by BTS, the core asset of BitShares, a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange.
Overview: The BitUSD is a market-pegged asset on the BitShares blockchain. It is backed by BTS, and the minimum required collateral for most bitAssets (including the bitUSD) is ~2x. This means that you need to put USD 200 worth of BTS into the contract to borrow just 100 bitUSD. In the end, the market peg is achieved by a social consensus in such that 1 bitUSD should be worth 1 USD. Hence, trading against the peg should make you lose money because someone else will make a profit from trading towards the peg.
Points of Interest: the process can be complicated to understand, and the value fluctuates due to market instability.
_______HAV_____
nUSDMarket Cap: USD 4.5 million / USD 976,600
CoinMarketCap Rank: 498 / 861
Type: fully collateralized, backed against each other
Overview: Havven is a dual-token system that aims to collateralize its token nomin (stable value of USD 1 and variable supply) with its token havven (variable value and fixed supply), relying solely on the markets forces and the underlying security of the blockchain technology to keep this stability. In order for any supply of nomin to exist, a certain amount of havven needs to be kept in escrow, locked away, as a collateral for the system. Whenever someone escrows a quantity of havven, nomins are issued and sold by the system at a limit order of USD 1 in a decentralized exchange (for ETH, for example), increasing the supply of nomins in the pool. If someone wishes to regain access to some (or all) of their havven, a limit buy order of USD 1 is placed by the system, and the nomins purchased are destroyed.
Points of Interest: decentralized, not pegged against an outside asset, self-reliant, but not very well-known outside of its fanbase."

",Could Europe’s next big crypto adopter be Spain? And might the country’s growing escalation of interest one day eclipse the region’s biggest blockchain powers? Evidence suggests that a wave of crypto fever has quietly washed over Spain in 2018 – leaving crypto pioneers very optimistic about what the future holds.,"Why the sudden rush of positivity? Well, for a start, some 10% of the surveyed Spaniards claimed their own cryptocurrency holdings, the fourth highest number in the European economic bloc, according to an international survey by ING, a Dutch financial giant, carried our between 26 March and 6 April 2018. That figure is nothing to sneeze at: France and Britain lag far behind with ownership rates of only 6%. Also, 32% of the surveyed Spaniards said that they ""expect to own cryptocurrency in the future,"" while almost 40% added that cryptocurrencies represent the future of online expenses and investment. A minority, yes, but not an insignificant one.In fact, the Spanish government’s recent decision to begin taxing crypto earnings may well be proof that crypto trading is as alive and well in Spain as it is in other early crypto-adopting nations like Japan.Spain’s central bank has also talked of creating its own digital currency. The bank recently issued a report stating that “digital currencies and blockchain technology could benefit Spanish monetary policy and financial infrastructure.”Media outlet Infobae stated that the bank was essentially proposing creating a Spanish answer to Venezuela’s Petro – a state-owned cryptocurrency.Crypto pay is also on the ascendancy in Spain.Jordi Calabia is a cryptocurrency investor in Barcelona. He told Cryptonews.com:“I remember going to a cryptocurrency-themed sushi bar a few years ago. It was by the seafront in the Costa Brava town where my parents live. It was fun, but quite gimmicky – and I think it has since closed down. This year, though, I have seen a lot more serious businesses in and around Barcelona start accepting Bitcoin and altcoins – from shops to restaurants that cater to tourists to the kind of places that only locals frequent.”Per a report in CMD Sport earlier this year, Spain has now welcomed its first crypto-friendly gyms – CrossFit centers in Madrid and Granada, operated by a company named Singular Box, where customers can pay membership fees in Bitcoin and other tokens. The news outlet quotes Singular Box’s owner as saying, “Cryptocurrencies provide one less barrier for new athletes who want to come and train with us. More and more people are making use of this financial technology. [The reaction from members] has been very positive. The feedback has been good.”Other gyms across the country have reportedly followed suit.Meanwhile, a network of holistic health clinics with branches in Almería, Granada, Jaén, Málaga and Córdoba last month told Diario Bitcoin that it had begun accepting Bitcoin and Ethereum payment because it “believes cryptocurrencies are the future of commerce in all industries.”And a house owner in Tarragona earlier this year sold his apartment for 40 BTC. Mister Piso, the real estate agent that conducted the deal, said that Bitcoin pay enabled ""a much speedier and more effective transaction than traditional payment methods,"" and actively advised the owner to request a crypto-only payment.Eurocoinpay, a Spanish crypto pay platform based in León, last month announced it was in talks with some of the country’s biggest high street retailers, including El Corte Inglés and Zara, as well as overseas brands such as Decathlon and French hypermarket chain Carrefour.El Economista states that the platform – Spain’s first of its kind – will potentially allow users to make in-store purchases with commission rates of 0.25%. One news site said the initiative would allow customers to “basically buy a dress in Zara paying in [cryptocurrencies], without having to go through the usual set of intermediary companies.”Even though businesses are becoming increasingly crypto-friendly, if digital tokens are to go mainstream in Spain, private individuals will probably take them there.A plethora of Spanish universities have begun offering cryptocurrency and blockchain-themed courses this year in response to growing demand – and have been inundated with applicants. These include the University of Navarra, the ESADE Business School and the Instituto de Empresa Business School in Madrid, some of the most prestigious business institutions in Europe. This year has also seen tertiary education establishments in Seville, Pozuelo, Cantabria, La Rioja, Pamplona and Barcelona begin offering blockchain and cryptocurrency training.Calabia notes:“There are communities of crypto and blockchain enthusiasts who meet up every week here in Barcelona. One I know of is thousands of members strong. People remember the time of the peseta, before the euro, when sudden currency fluctuations were common. Crypto offers Spaniards an alternative to government-controlled or Brussels-regulated currencies. A lot of people just don’t trust governments to make sound financial decisions. That’s why a lot of us are now keen to make investments in cryptocurrencies.”Asked if she thought Spain’s rising crypto-enthusiasm represented a groundswell of interest, Cadiz-based IT expert Marta Castillo told Cryptonews.com, “Yes. Many ordinary people are starting to dabble. They talk about crypto a lot, and people are becoming much more knowledgeable about blockchain and token-related matters. I think 2019 will be a very interesting year in Spain for this sort of technology.”"

","Cryptocurrency wallet and data provider Blockchain has announced an airdrop of USD 125 million in Stellar Lumens (XLM), nearly half a billion tokens, in an attempt to boost crypto adoption. However, the news didn’t elicit as much of a positive response as the company might have hoped: the community is not persuaded that this is the best way to foster adoption, arguing that it doesn’t make sense.","Even immediately following the announcement on Twitter, replies like “This must be a scam” began to flood in. Pierre Rochard, founder of Bitcoin Advisory, a firm that specializes in Bitcoin's economics and software engineering, wrote, “Be very careful about using services that enable ‘give away’ scams, it likely means that they are starved for revenue and will do anything for a quick buck. Don't trust them, don't trust people that are associated with them.” Although co-founder of Blockchain Nicolas Cary immediately replied that this is no scam and “We're really going to give away the money,” Rochard was quick to point out: “You're not giving away the money, you're giving away XLM.”Recently, Blockchain launched the foundation for the Blockchain Airdrops, together with the criteria that will guide the company in selecting which tokens we will airdrop to our users.A big problem that the community has with this airdrop is the fact that you have to create a Blockchain wallet and go through their KYC (know your customer) procedure to be eligible for the airdrop. Bitcoin developer Udi Wertheimer writes, “If you’re a [blockchain.info] wallet user, this is a pretty bad deal for you.

","The deadline for filing a rehabilitation claim with the infamous Mt. Gox exchange is rapidly approaching; claimants have until Monday, October 22nd to send proof of being a victim in the exchange’s hack. ","Nobuaki Kobayashi, the trustee of the exchange opened up the process in August as part of its civil rehabilitation process.A separate Q&A document, published in August, says that, “The planned deadline for the Rehabilitation Trustee to submit a statement of approval or rejection to the court is January 24, 2019, but, at the current point in time, a definite date has not been determined.” There has been no update on this situation as of right now.However, according to a Reddit post on the topic, during a Q&A session of the creditors meeting on September 26th Kobayashi confirmed that he is going ahead with self-admission of claims. These so-called zombie claims mean that if the trustee is aware of anyone who should have a claim, he will file a claim on their behalf. In other words, anyone that had an account on Mt. Gox and appears on their database, even with just a few dollars or satoshis on the exchange, will have a claim filed in their name. However, if the funds are unclaimed after a certain amount of time, it will pass to the Japanese treasury. According to reports, there are about 75.000 small accounts that make up about 10% to 20% of total claim value.""In practice this means a reduction of claim value for BTC claimants, and the Japanese government benefiting. Our group (mtgoxlegal.com) are currently fundraising to keep our lawyer on this,"" the post reads. However, there is no official announcement regarding the ""zombie claims.""The road to recovery has not been completely smooth to all claimants, however. In a subreddit dedicated to the legal proceedings of Mt. Gox, many users complain that the call center is hard to reach, even during business hours, and that the process itself is confusing. The community also speculates that the payout should happen around summer to fall 2019. Reddit user u/Btc_Hawker said they were attending the previous creditors’ meeting on September 26th, and writes, “[I] will be asking the trustee to pay out an interim distribution of all the cash owed to depositors and the vast bulk of the Bitcoin in February. There is no justification for further delay once civil rehabilitation is approved.” The user did not further update on this.The next Mt. Gox creditors’ meeting is set for March 20th, 2019. Before that, the period to examine Proofs of rehabilitation claims is set from January 31st to February 7th, 2019. Launched in July 2010, by 2013 and into 2014 Mt. Gox was handling over 70% of all bitcoin transactions worldwide, as the largest bitcoin intermediary and the world's leading bitcoin exchange, according to Wikipedia. Mt.

","The Forbes magazine has released its annual “30 Under 30” ranking for 2019, celebrating the top entrepreneurs under the age of 30 in over 20 categories each, and picking out the “brashest entrepreneurs across the United States and Canada” in its own words. Out of all those, a total of four entrepreneurs from the crypto industry have made it onto the list. They are all founders and co-founders of  projects, such as Lightning Labs, developer of the Lightning network, and Bitwise Asset Management, a crypto investment company. Let’s take a look at who they are.","Olaoluwa Osuntokun is the co-founder and CTO of Lightning Labs, the company behind one of the best-known scalability solutions for Bitcoin. The company has raised USD 2.5 million to turn bitcoin into a more viable form of payment by making smaller transactions more cost effective.
Osuntokun got his computer science degree at the University of California, Santa Barbara. During his graduate studies he focused on the field of applied cryptography, specifically encrypted search. He has worked both at the University as a researcher and teaching assistant, as well as Google as an intern, before co-founding Lightning Labs with CEO Elizabeth Stark.Hunter Horsley is the CEO of Bitwise Asset Management, among other things known for BIT10, a cryptocurrency basket that can help newcomers in the space. He has raised USD 4 million from Khosla Ventures, Naval Ravikant, the CEO and a co-founder of AngelList, a U.S. website for startups, and others to build these cryptocurrency indices that rely on transparent criteria. 
Among 40 crypto hedge funds that use Bitwise's four indices as benchmarks is Morgan Creek, which manages USD 1.5 billion in assets, and 600 multi-family offices.
He got his economics degree at the Wharton school, University of Pennsylvania. After that, he has worked as product manager at both Facebook and Instagram, before turning to Bitwise. Nader Al-Naji is the founder and CEO at Intangible Labs, which raised USD 133 million from the likes of Andreessen Horowitz and Bain Capital Ventures to develop a cryptocurrency that can be used to make payments. His main product is Basis, a stable cryptocurrency designed to replace central banks.
With a computer science degree from Princeton, he worked at D. E. Shaw and Google as a software developer, and founded Basis in July 2017.JB Rubinovitz is an artist turned entrepreneur, as well as a machine-learning engineer, and the primary force behind Bail Bloc, which aims to upend the bail financing industry and has raised enough money to bail out 100 criminally arrested individuals by mining cryptocurrency. 
Bail Bloc mines Monero and converts it to US dollars, donating it to The Bronx Freedom Fund. Once installed on a user’s computer, Bail Bloc uses a small amount of the computer’s power to mine for Monero in the background, so daily use of the computer is unaffected. Rubinovitz’s computer science degree hails from Columbia University in the City of New York. _______The Forbes 30-Under-30 list is another indication of the growing influence of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology as it expands from being a niche area of fintech into an industrial heavyweight in its own right. Earlier this year Fortune also recognized the likes of Ethereum’s Vitalik Buterin, and Coinbase’s Brian Armstrong in its “40 under 40” list. Last year, Buterin made it onto the “30 under 30” list as well."

","2018 has been a tough year for crypto investors. Bitcoin has declined by more than 60% and leading altcoins have lost up to 90% of their value. Nonetheless, there are still traders who are making bank in the crypto asset markets despite the bear market. ","In this guide, you will discover how you can deploy a market neutral trading strategy to potentially generate a trading profit despite the difficult current market environment. A market neutral investment strategy aims to profit from both rising and declining prices while avoiding overall market risk. The are various strategies that fall under the umbrella term “market neutral,” such as convertible arbitrage, merger arbitrage, relative value arbitrage and equity market neutral. In this guide, we will focus on equity market neutral arbitrage and how it can be applied in the crypto asset markets. An equity market neutral strategy involves going long a basket of stocks versus short a basket of comparable stocks to remain “market neutral” so that the investors can alleviate market risk. For example, a portfolio manager can go long tech stocks that he or she believes will outperform while going short comparable tech stocks within the same sector that he or she believes will underperform to benefit from the price differential of his long picks versus his short picks. As the short and long positions alleviate equity market risk, this creates a market neutral portfolio that can generate a profit regardless of how the S&P500 Index performs. This strategy is sometimes also referred to as “pair trading” as it can also involve buying one stock and short selling another. Equity hedge funds and market neutral mutual funds have been deploying this investment since the 1980s. In Q1/2018, when the price of bitcoin dropped by 50% from USD 14,110 to USD 7,050, two hedge funds managed to generate 30% and 5.4% perfect return on investment respectively due to their market neutral investment approach. According to Bloomberg, Amber AI Group’s Pivot Digital Trading-2 fund, also known as PDT2, managed to generate a 30% return in the first quarter by avoiding directional bets and instead focusing on a market neutral strategy. BitSpread Group’s Market Neutral Liquidity fund generated a return of investment of 5.4% in the first quarter. While most crypto hedge funds’ performances are closely tied to the overall performance of the crypto asset markets, market neutral funds are managing to buck the trend and generate returns regardless of the overall market's performance. Hence, funds like Amber AI’s PDT2 and BitSpread’s Market Neutral Liquidy are able to offer investors a degree of protection during a bear market. Having said that, it is important to note that market neutral funds will generally not perform as well as funds that are highly correlated with the market during a bull market. While market neutral investment strategies are normally deployed by institutional investors, this approach can also be adopted by small investors in the cryptocurrency markets by engaging in pair trading. A pair trading strategy could be executed involving two comparable digital tokens within the same token sector. For example, you could go long EOS (EOS) versus short ether (ETH) - using the same dollar amount - if you believe that EOS is the superior platform for smart contracts and dapps (decentralized applications). In this instance, you would benefit from EOS outperforming ETH while overall market risk would be negated. If the market declines, which it has done throughout most of 2018, you would earn a profit on your short position and lose money on your long position. The difference between the outperforming long position versus the underperforming short position, however, you would be able to bank as profit regardless of the direction of the market. If you would have engaged in a long EOS versus short ETH trade at the start of the year, you would have generated a profit on this position as ether dropped by around 60% while EOS only dropped by around 45% year-to-date. Alternatively, if, for example, you have done your research on privacy-centric digital currencies, you could enter into a trade where you buy Monero (XMR) and sell Verge (XVG). Both are comparable assets as they are both among the most popular anonymous coins. However, most crypto investors would argue that Monero is the better project. Hence, a long XMR versus short XVG pair trade would be another example of a market neutral position that anyone could put on. If you would have put this trade on at the beginning of the year, you would have made a profit as XMR dropped by 75% while XVG dropped by almost 95%. Instead of pair trading, you could also choose a basket of coins or tokens you want to go long versus a basket that you want to go short. For example, remaining in the anonymous cryptocurrencies realm, you could go long the three privacy coins with the largest market capitalizations (Monero, Dash, and ZCash) versus the three with the next largest market capitalizations (Verge, Komodo, and Horizen (previously - ZenCash) provided you believe that the market value of these projects accurately reflects their future potential. The investment horizon of market neutral trades can be short or medium-term, depending on your personal preference and overall investment approach. Over the long-term, however, shorting one or more crypto assets could become too costly. Hence, it is more of a short to medium-term trading strategy. Before executing a market neutral strategy such as pair trading, there are a few things that crypto investors need to consider. Firstly, the two pairs in question will need to have a high positive correlation. That means they will need to move in tandem as the market moves. If the two chosen assets do not correlate, buying one versus selling the other will likely not result in the desired returns. Secondly, trading fees need to be taken into consideration as well as the lending fee for short selling. As this strategy is more trading intensive than buying and “hodling” a portfolio, fees play a role as they reduce profits. Thirdly, the most important aspect is to identify the right comparables to make this strategy work. For example, pairing up a utility token of a smart contract platform with a reward token will not make for a good trading pair. Hence, it is important to look in detail at the comparables you want to trade and to research each project thoroughly so that you can identify which one you should go long and which one you should go short. Finally, it is also important to note that this strategy involves a certain degree of active involvement. Hence, it is more suitable for those who have the time to check in with their investments on a daily basis and have the time to research projects thoroughly before investing."

October 04, 2018
","It is inevitable that some jurisdictions will accommodate blockchains and their effects in a more efficient and attractive manner than others and this competition can facilitate blockchain development, Anastasios A. Antoniou, member of the EU Blockchain Observatory & Forum, Policy and Framework Working Group, wrote in a recent opinion piece. ","“It is for this reason that blockchain developers should inform the law’s response to code by engaging with legislators and regulators,” Antoniou, who’s also co-founding partner of Antoniou McCollum & Co., a Cyprus law firm, added.His opinion contrasts with that of the Bank’s for International Settlements (BIS), sometimes referred to as the “central bank of central banks.” In September, BIS warned that international coordination is the only way to properly regulate the cryptocurrency market, due to the global nature of this new market.In either case, competition among states in the blockchain industry will require a radical change in the regulatory approach, according to Antoniou. He stressed that law is not ready to address all aspects of blockchain implementations. “Characteristic examples of this include the apparent misalignment between blockchains and the GDPR, the challenges in classifying assetised tokens as securities and the questions of attributing liability for harm suffered by the operation of blockchain-driven organisations,” the lawyer said.Explaining that the originally centralized nature cyberspace allowed for laws to be created and applied to the space, the author argues that the decentralized nature of blockchain is “on a silent collision course” with the law, and that this is something that must be addressed.Referring to a 2018 paper named Blockchain and the Law, which suggests that blockchains can create “order without law” by following “private regulatory frameworks,” the author suggested that blockchains today entails a level of “detachment from current regulatory architectures,” while adding that “this detachment will only widen as blockchains evolve.”Antoniou further stressed that in order to foster continued development of blockchain technology, new legislation that support the technology must be developed. According to him, blockchains can “find its place within a well-structured, relevant and versatile regulatory framework,” and thus reach its full potential.The view presented by Antoniou echoes previous statements by Andreas M. Antonopoulos, the famous Bitcoin evangelist, that smart contracts are not legally binding contracts, and that “whether those things are within the law, or accepted by the law, or recognized by the law, has nothing to do with how the smart contract works.”Taken one step further, it could be argued that in order for smart contracts to be applied to real-world use cases, an effective regulatory framework must be created for them to fit within. This is in line with Antoniou’s view that blockchains need a legal framework in order to foster development that would make it “the first technological development since the advent of the Internet that could give rise to entirely new ecosystems of economic activity.”Meanwhile, yesterday the European Parliament voted in favour of the motion for a resolution on distributed ledger technologies and blockchains: building trust with disintermediation. The resolution calls for ""progressive and innovation-friendly regulation.""""We experience a strong entrepreneurial interest in blockchain. We, as regulators, need to make sure that all this effort will be embraced by the necessary institutional and legal certain,” MEP Eva Kaili, the author of the resolution, said.""The technology is still in a premature state, so we as decision makers should be open-minded towards this technology. Let’s not create unnecessary regulatory obstacles which can hinder the development of blockchain,” said MEP Antanas Guoga, who's also the backer of Cryptonews.com.A motion of a resolution is an official position of the European Parliament on certain issues. If adopted, the resolution will be forwarded to the European Commission for consideration."

","Cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex is reportedly leaving its customers disgruntled: some of them have been waiting for weeks to withdraw their fiat, without a solution in sight. Meanwhile, the exchange officially claims that the withdrawals have been going on smoothly and “without the slightest interference.”","Users have been taking to social networks like Reddit to complain about the service. User u/krJq333 has been posting their story over the span of weeks, the latest being six days ago, titled, “GBP Express Withdrawal: Three Weeks Later Still No Funds.” The user writes, “The support I've received from Bitfinex this week (or more precisely the complete lack of it) has been nothing short of abysmal. I chased my ticket every day requesting an update; all of those messages were ignored.”They’re not the only one, either: u/k_stoyanov made a long post detailing the withdrawal process, and all the problems users run into, as well as sharing a few things they’ve learned about Bitfinex in the meantime. The user claims Bitfinex is using a third party - in this case, Crypto Capital, a fiat banking platform, - for fiat withdrawals. According to the Redditor, when contacted, they replied, “We have been experiencing technical issues which have caused delays in external transfers. Currently your transactions are pending. <...> If you'd like, I can return the funds to your account in the meantime.” They give no estimate of the time frame until the problems are resolved.Some users claiming to be Bitfinex employees reach out to those with complains asking for ticket numbers, and the rest of the conversation happens in private. However, Coindesk reports that one user shared their experience with them. User u/saloprj initiated his USD 99,900 withdrawal on October 8th, and has been tenaciously contacting the exchange ever since. The last response from them was on November 7th seems to shed some light on the issue: “The finance department has been inundated with requests recently. Our new deposit system has not been fully integrated yet and as a result our previous correspondent bank is finalising some of the outstanding withdrawals which has created a backlog.”Some users simply opted for withdrawing their funds in crypto and switching to fiat on another exchange. u/k_stoyanov has withdrawn the money in bitcoin, sent it to Kraken, and withdrawn euros from that exchange, adding, “This was the only option for me.”Meanwhile, Bitfinex, the 16th largest exchange by the 24-hour trading volume, officially does not even acknowledge that there is a problem. The exchange remains completely silent, reportedly often refusing to reply to their customers, and not replying at all to requests for comment. Their last acknowledgment of the issue was on October 15, when the exchange published an announcement saying, “all cryptocurrency and fiat withdrawals are, and have been, processing as usual without the slightest interference.” They added, “all fiat (USD, GBP, JPY, EUR) withdrawals are processing, and have been, as usual.”Reddit users have also started a thread titled, “Don't forget to post when fiat withdrawals are successful.” However, the results have been grim: several users write that their withdrawals, started in September, were completed only within the past few days - a timespan of around 7 weeks. Some others are taking this to mean that there is hope for them yet. However, the general consensus is, “Welcome to the 19th century,” as user u/ImmediateCaptain puts it.At the time of writing, the 24-hour trading volume on Bitfinex stands at USD 225 million, according to CoinMarketCap."

_____________________________________________________________________________","Dallas, Texas – Friday, November 16th, 2018:  Mark Cuban, owner of the Dallas Mavericks, together with Antanas Guoga, co-founder of Lympo, have announced the official launch of Lympo, the nation’s first blockchain fitness app, and the first of its kind that rewards users with crypto tokens holding real monetary value that can be exchanged for premium products within its own in-app Lympo Shop. The free application pioneers a revolutionary new concept in wellness and personal technology.Speaking today from the Lympo Practice Facility for the Dallas Mavericks, the heads of both partnering organizations introduced the newly launched app, as the first of its kind to use blockchain technology combined with fitness gamification to reward users for walking and running towards a healthier way of life. Those who subscribe to an active lifestyle and are ready to Walk. Run. Earn with Lympo, are invited to download the free app and learn more at http://Lympo.com.With the help of blockchain technology and fitness gamification, users are rewarded with LYM crypto tokens through the Lympo app for completing simple walking and running challenges. These tokens have monetary value and can be used to purchase sports and fitness products by today’s leading brands in the Lympo Shop – the first online store to accept fitness token payments. Lympo is developing the option to sync data with various fitness and health tracking apps and wearables to help analyze and evaluate activities while offering personalized health and fitness advice and bespoke services to the user.“Lympo is a seamless tool for motivating people to become healthy and adopt an active lifestyle,” says Antanas Guoga, co-founder of Lympo. “By improving the well-being of people around the world and providing tangible incentives through our unique technology, we aim to unite fitness and wellness communities everywhere. Lympo will utilize the data we track on our phones and wearables to reward users for the lifestyle goals they achieve.  We are very excited to debut Lympo in partnership with the Dallas Mavericks, a true custodian in the health and fitness arena.”The Lympo app offers challenges both by Lympo and its partners – coaches, wellness brands, various health, sports and fitness industry associations or influencers for example. Users can join these challenges, track their walking or running activities and get rewarded with LYM tokens upon completion. A challenge is completed when the required distance is covered. Users can also see the amount of LYM they have in their in-app wallet, including all transactions and the monetary LYM equivalent in dollars or euros. After saving a certain amount of LYM, the user is able to purchase exclusive sporting goods in the in-app store, providing an incentive to complete additional challenges.  “Lympo is all about making positive changes by taking small steps towards a more active lifestyle,” says Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban. “Lympo doesn’t require you to drastically change your daily habits, but it’s a great incentive to gain real rewards, like Mavs tickets and gear, for fitness efforts. Lympo offers a great opportunity for partnering businesses by increasing brand awareness through sponsored challenges, while opening a direct channel of communication with niche sports, health and fitness enthusiasts.” The Dallas Mavericks are Lympo’s founding U.S. partner and will engage fans through unique challenges and rewards through the app. While the compelling benefits of Lympo’s reward-based platform are self-evident for the user, the application also presents a unique appeal for small, medium and large corporations that are looking to improve customer loyalty. Lympo brand partners are able to attract new and existing customers through the ownership of specific challenges; tailor rewards to encourage specific behavior; access tech-savvy health and fitness enthusiasts within Lympo’s user base, or interact directly with Lympo’s clientele by hosting a series of community-based events, using Lympo as a launchpad.LYM is a crypto (utility) token, a central part of the Lympo ecosystem, used to reward users for their fitness efforts. The LYM token is also a revolutionary means of payment, allowing its users to monetize their fitness efforts and data. LYM is based on the Ethereum blockchain platform, which ensures the security and the technical stability of the token. Within the Lympo environment, LYM acts as any other traditional currency. The price of LYM is determined by market forces and is constantly changing in relation to other crypto and traditional currencies. LYM tokens currently serve as utility tokens on the platform to buy products on the in-app store. A broader range of healthy lifestyle products and services from Lympo partners will become available, such as personal training sessions or gym memberships, diet and exercise plans and the latest workout accessories. User-generated and user-controlled data will be the driver for the app’s functionality.Lympo has been actively forming partnerships with elite athletes, including current World Champion discus thrower, Andrius Gudžius, as well as with the top-ranked female tennis player, Caroline Wozniacki, both of whom are Lympo brand ambassadors.Download the app, select your challenge, and start being rewarded for your fitness goals at http://Lympo.com."

","Sirin Labs, the company working on what they claimed was the world’s first blockchain phone, has just unveiled that very same phone named Finney. Featuring a cold storage wallet, a special operating system and an additional secret screen called the Safe Screen, the phone is claimed to “bridge the gap between mass adoptions of blockchain technology.”","The phone runs Sirin OS, a special operating system developed by the company that is based on the Android operating system and is tweaked to be “ultra-secure.” The Cybersecurity Suite within the phone features a behavioral based Intrusion Prevention System, a physical security switch and three-factor authentication: biometric, lock pattern, and behavioral. How this will function in reality is currently anybody’s guess, but it certainly sounds promising.Other, less specific features of the phone include:The smartphone is named after Hal Finney, the second ever user of Bitcoin (after Satoshi Nakamoto).According to the roadmap on the Sirin Labs website, the phone is set to launch this month. However, the announcement gives no indication when this might be. The phone will cost USD 999 and be available in brick-and-mortar stores, the first of which is under construction in London. Other locations include Turkey, Israel, Germany, Kazakhstan, Vietnam, South Korea, Japan, and the US. There is currently no information on the availability of stores in South America, Africa and Australia - however, there seem to be no geographical restrictions on ordering the phone online.Preorders also get a discount of 10%, and the phone is sold for SRN tokens. The price of SRN currently stands at around USD 0.18 - an increase of 38.69% in the past 24 hours. The token is ERC20, meaning that purchasing and storing it is easily done with Ethereum and in Ethereum wallets. SRN price chart:However, it remains unclear whether the phone will really be the first blockchain phone, given that HTC released Exodus 1, the early access version of their blockchain phone, which is expected to be shipped by December. Also, in October, Pundi X, a developer of crypto payments solutions, has demonstrated a blockchain-powered smartphone called the XPhone. Now, the race to be the first blockchain phone on the market begins."

October 11, 2018
","Thanks to Nouriel Roubini, NYU economist and crypto critic dubbed Dr Doom for his prediction of the 2008 financial crisis, the whole cryptoverse is starting to get a distinct Marvel feel to it, and he’s the villain. This time, he is testing the boundaries of Cryptoville by taking a shot at Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of the Ethereum platform, calling him a scammer and a thief. In response to that, Buterin revealed for the first time the amount of ETH he holds - less than 1%.","Although it may be fun to imagine Buterin with a cape valiantly fighting the sinister Dr Doom - clothed in a fittingly menacing costume which we will leave to your imagination - the debate happened on a much less interesting podium: Twitter. Roubini initially tweeted, “@VitalikButerin was the ring-leader - together with Joe Lubin - of the criminal pre-mining sale/scam that created Ether. They stole 75% of the Ether supply and became instant ‘billionaires’ of fake wealth.” (As previously reported, Ethereum is the most profitable initial coin offering.)Vitalik came forward to reply, “I never personally held more than ~0.9% of all ETH, and my net worth never came close to USD 1 billion. Also, I'm pretty sure there are no criminal laws against pre-mining,” adding in a later tweet the Etherscan link with all large trading they’ve done, including some gifts and charity donations. The address holds 365,003 ETH, worth more than USD 70 million - nowhere near close USD 1 billion. https://t.co/yLfy39gwB5Though that doesn't just include sales, it also includes some gifts and charity donations.Still, the whole thing was partially instigated by Buterin, when he tweeted, “I officially predict a financial crisis some time between now and 2021. Not because I have any special knowledge or even actually think that, but so that I can have a ~25 percent (or whatever) chance of later being publicly acclaimed as ‘a guru who predicted the last financial crisis.’”To this, Roubini felt himself called out, so he replied, “Vitalik, just shut up & speak about stuff that you can claim u know a lil about. You have promising Proof of Stake since 2013 & we are still waiting for a system that is scalable, decentralized & secure. But that is impossible as your inconsistent trinity principle proves.” Vitalik was quick to defend himself by writing: “Umm... the scalability trilemma was about scalable blockchains, not PoS; those are two separate topics. And the trilemma was never an impossibility result, it was claiming that getting 3 of 3 is *hard*,” later adding that, “the design is basically done and we're in the development stages now.”There is no way to know who won, as fans of both are replying to the tweets and resorting even to ad hominem attacks, but that’s the way it usually goes - at least Marvel is cleaner. And of course, this is far from the first time that Dr Doom is attacking: only days ago, he tweeted that crypto is ""more centralized than North Korea,"" bringing forth people who loved to laugh at him.Ah, Twitter… Never change."
