The top cryptocurrency ...","Aug 13, 2019 at 11:00 UTC","Bitcoin (BTC) now needs to break above $13,200 to revive the stalled bull market, a key monthly chart pattern suggests.","The top cryptocurrency by market value created an “inside bar” pattern in July, with the monthly high and low of $13,200 and $9,049, respectively, falling within June’s trading range of $13,880 to $7,432.An inside bar candle is characterized by a higher low and a lower high than the previous candle, and represents an indecisive market or consolidation in a narrowing price range.A convincing break above the inside bar’s high is widely considered a sign of a bullish breakout. As such, July’s high of $13,200 is now the level to beat for the bulls.As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $11,220 on Bitstamp, representing little change on a 24-hour basis.BTC broke into a bull market in April and rose to a 17-month high of $13,880 before creating last month’s inside bar candle (above left).Coming after a notable uptrend, the pattern suggests bullish exhaustion and an impending bullish-to-bearish trend change.That said, a bearish reversal would be confirmed only if BTC ends the current month below July’s low of $9,049.On the other hand, acceptance above $13,200 (July’s high) would signal a continuation of the rally from April’s low near $4,050.The probability of BTC ending the current month above $13,200 would rise if prices print a bullish weekly (Sunday, UTC) close above $12,000.As can be seen (above right), the cryptocurrency has failed four times in the last seven weeks to find acceptance above $12,000. Many observers believe a weekly close above $12,000 would imply a continuation of the bull market.While the argument has merit, a stronger confirmation would be a high-volume move above $13,200.As for the next 24 hours, BTC risks falling below $11,000.BTC has created a lower high at the lower edge of a flag pattern (above left) in the last 24 hours, reinforcing the bearish view put forward by the flag breakdown – a bearish continuation pattern – confirmed yesterday.Selling volume is again ticking up, validating the bearish setup, while the relative strength index, too, is reporting bearish conditions with a below-50 print. The 5- and 10-day moving averages (MAs) have produced a bearish crossover.As a result, prices may well drop toward the 5-week moving average, currently at $10,778.The bearish case would weaken if prices rise above $11,431, invalidating the bearish lower highs setup. In that case, $12,000 could come into play.Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.Bitcoin image via shutterstock; charts by Trading View"

from ...","Aug 12, 2019 at 11:00 UTC","Bitcoin (BTC) could drop below $11,000 in the next 24 hours, after sellers took victory in a four-day-long tug of war with the bulls.","The top cryptocurrency’s trading range had tightened in the four days to Aug. 9, with prices printing lower highs above $12,000 and higher lows in the range of $11,200 to $11,650.That contracting triangle pattern represented a stiff battle between the bulls and the bears, as well as bullish exhaustion following a 35 percent rally from July 28 lows near $9,100.A range breakout would have meant a continuation of the uptrend. Prices, however, dived out of the narrowing price range on Saturday, confirming victory for the bears.The range breakdown had been expected, as a key technical indicator on the intraday charts was flashing signs of bearish reversal, as discussed on Friday.So far, the downside has been restricted to levels around the former resistance-turned-support of $11,100. The cryptocurrency dipped to a low of $11,080 on Sunday before rising back above $11,500 earlier today.As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $11,355 on Bitstamp, representing little change on a 24-hour basis.BTC fell from $11,871 to $11,200 in the 60 minutes to 12:00 UTC on Aug. 10, confirming a downside break of the narrowing price range. The breakdown was backed by a surge in selling volume, as represented by the red bar (above left).On the line chart (above right), BTC has dived out of an inverted flag – a continuation pattern that accelerates the preceding bearish move.The flag breakdown has opened the doors to $10,800 (target as per the measured move method).Seasoned traders may consider a long-tailed hammer candle created in 60 minutes to 10:00 UTC on Sunday as a sign of bullish revival. The candle, however, lacked volume support.That said, the hammer would gain credence if prices rise above the flag high of $11,589, in which case a rise to $12,000 could be on the cards.BTC created a candle with a long upper wick last week, as it failed to close (Sunday, UTC) above the $12,000 mark.Notably, the cryptocurrency has failed four times in the last seven weeks to find acceptance above $12,000, as indicated by the candles with long upper wicks.It is often observed that markets test dip demand after facing multiple rejections at key price levels. So, a pullback to sub-$11,000 levels, as suggested by the intraday chart, looks likely.Note that the ascending (bullish) 5- and 10-week moving averages are currently located at $10,804 and $10,625, respectively.A strong bounce from these levels, if any, could yield a break above $12,000. A bull revival, however, needs a weekly close above $12,000. That would imply a resumption of the rally from April’s low near $4,050.Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.Bitcoin image via CoinDesk archives; charts by Trading View"

Yet, many ...","Aug 14, 2019 at 04:11 UTC","“Half of the audience here is like, ‘I hope you die in a fire.’”","As a libertarian, comedian and podcast host Dave Smith has a lot of common ground with bitcoin enthusiasts, who have a reputation for having a libertarian bent. But when he and others argue that bitcoin isn’t going to replace government-issued currencies, Smith argues (jokingly, of course) that this is the response he gets.Smith’s opening Soho Forum, a monthly debate in south Manhattan, attracting a group of mostly libertarians, or people that believe less government input in people’s lives would improve the world’s standard of living.Monday’s topic is whether bitcoin is “suited” to help with that, by taking on central banks, the powerful entities across the world that control national money supplies, for better or worse. Judging by the fact that it’s a libertarian debate, most in the crowd were agreement on the point that the role of central banks should be audited or diminished, if not eliminated altogether.Bitcoin takes control over the creation of money from any one entity, including governments. It sounds like a libertarian fantasy. Yet, many libertarians seem pretty skeptical it will actually pan out as a currency that will replace government currencies.The precise wording of the resolution up to debate was: “Bitcoin is poorly suited to the purpose of becoming any nation’s main medium of exchange,” or an object that can be transferred for goods. Think the dollar.With economist George Selgin arguing in favor of this resolution, while “The Bitcoin Standard” author and economist Saifedean Ammous argued against.Selgin likes the goals of bitcoin. introducing more currency competition where governments currently have sole power. In fact, he’s the director of a research wing of the Cato Institute exploring alternatives to central banks.But bitcoin, he argued, “isn’t up to the task.”“The first question about money is, ‘What can you buy with it?’” Selgin argued, cutting to the chase.He pointed out that it’s hard for people to find a store that even accepts the cryptocurrency.“When ordinary people – which excludes many of you – think, ‘What kind of money do I want to equip myself with? What should I use as a medium of exchange?’ The answer, first of all is, what’s everyone else using? What does the store down the street take?” the economist said, implying that bitcoin does not satisfy these needs.But he was just getting started.The economist continued:“How risky is this to have on hand all the time? Is it going to decrease rapidly in value while I’m at the grocery store? Do I have to come up with all sorts of elaborate plans to protect myself?”He went on to argue that bitcoin is not generally the answer people come away with when thinking about these questions. Additionally, Selgin pointed to bitcoin’s volatility in price, sometimes high transaction fees, and slow settlement as other reasons your average Joe isn’t flocking to bitcoin – and probably won’t.Ammous, on the other hand, argued that while bitcoin isn’t perfect, it continues to grow quite rapidly.“I think the notion that bitcoin has been failing is completely unrealistic. […] Bitcoin has been growing non-stop the last 10 years,” Ammous said.While Selgin argues it is hard to find a store that accepts bitcoin, Ammous argues that’s because use is spread across the whole globe, rather than being restricted to just one nation. By global economic statistics, he asserted that bitcoin is one of the 20 largest-valued currencies in the world.“Most importantly, it is the only working alternative to central banks,” he said, not swayed by the idea that a better alternative will come along and replace itGive it time to mature, he said.“The idea that bitcoin has to be born ready to handle everybody’s transactions overnight and to have all the world’s liquidity to do it overnight from its creation – or else it has failed – I think that’s a completely unrealistic way of assessing it. Bitcoin is growing in every metric that matters,” Ammous said.He pointed out that other moneys have been replaced with newer ones over time.Seashells have been used as money by groups of people in the past, for example. What he is implying here is clear: bitcoin might be the next in line.Debate image provided by Uncle Zach"

From then, it dropped and ultimately vanished into early 2019, only to return again recently, running at around 5 to 10 percent.But last week, local newspapers started to notice that bitcoin was back to trading lower in won terms. The Dong-a Ilbo, one of the country’s major publications, reported on August 5 that bitcoin was priced just 2.15 percent higher in dollar markets than in won on South Korean exchanges.The deficit persists. On August 13, bitcoin was trading on Upbit at 13,678,000 won and quoted on CoinDesk at $11,429.14, which translates to 13,931,951 won, a difference of 253,951 ($208). That’s about 1.8 percent lower. At the end of the day on Tuesday in Korea, the gap had narrowed, but it remained.The Dong-a Ilbo believes that the end of the kimchi premium has something to do with the fall of the Korean won. Since the end of July, the local currency has lost almost 3 percent of its value against the dollar.At the same time, the regulatory environment is becoming more challenging for crypto exchanges in Korea. The banks are starting to more strictly apply AML guidelines and local regulatory requirements, such as real name accounts, while the authorities have recently said they are going to directly supervise the markets.The University of Calgary researchers argue in an April 2019 paper that the kimchi premium is largely structural. Transfers between markets can take time, and this makes arbitrage difficult.Profiting on the price difference is a risky trade due to the delay and the volatility of the coin, so the volume of these price correcting transactions is often too low to close the gap. The researchers also said that high transaction costs might disincentivize moves between the markets.Exchange controls in Korea, though primarily administrative these days, do add friction and can slow the movement of funds needed to balance the arbitrage trade. The controls also have a way of making bitcoin more attractive to people in Korea, as the coin is transnational in nature and potentially a good vehicle for bypassing the exchange controls, the researchers added in their paper.Korean won image via Shutterstock"

situation in global finance is so disturbing. The Backdrop. It all begun ...","Aug 12, 2019 at 02:30 UTC",Michael J. Casey is the chairman of CoinDesk’s advisory board and a senior advisor for blockchain research at MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative.,"The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers.The global economy faces its biggest crisis in 11 years.In theory, this should be bitcoin’s moment to shine, a chance to prove itself as an uncorrelated asset immune from political risks. Eventually, that result may bear out. But a rocky road lies ahead – for bitcoiners and nocoiners alike.Before we do the bitcoin up-or-down game, let’s dive into why the current situation in global finance is so disturbing.It all begun last Monday, when Beijing let the renminbi fall below RMB7.0 to the dollar.Almost immediately, the U.S. Treasury Department said it would take the rare step of labeling China a “currency manipulator,” a move that, in theory, would give the Trump Administration legal cover to impose punitive sanctions against Chinese. Markets freaked out at the specter of a currency war, a tit-for-tat feedback loop of exchange rate depreciations fueling a destructive downward spiral in trade and growth.Now, that fear may never play out.On Thursday, the People’s Bank of China helped assuage investors’ fears. In buying more renminbi to stabilize its value, it signaled that it isn’t, for now, intending to aggressively use its currency as a trade weapon.Also, the U.S. pronouncement made no sense. By the Treasury Department’s own definition, manipulation entails persistent, one-sided intervention in markets to weaken the domestic currency. But the renminbi’s fall came because the PBOC briefly had pared back its prior interventions supporting it.If anything, China has persistently done the opposite of market manipulation over the past five years, propping up its currency against a market that wanted to take it lower, all in order to refocus the country’s economic growth model away from a dependence on foreign exports.On that basis, there’s no way the International Monetary Fund or World Trade Organization would support the Trump Administration’s case that China is a currency manipulator, leaving the U.S. vulnerable to very harmful international sanctions if it were to unilaterally hit China with retribution on that basis.The problem is the global political and economic environment doesn’t build confidence that politicians will act rationally. Facts and multilateral institutions’ views carry less weight in an era when major Western nations are retreating from the neoliberal norms of the nineties and aughts. So, don’t be surprised if we see even more extreme market turmoil over currency-war risk in the near future.Any escalation would play out in a global spiral. A weaker renminbi means all other countries that trade with China are also disadvantaged. So, they’ll also feel compelled to weaken their currencies, which means their trading partners will, in turn, feel pressured to do so.Any countries with nominally free-floating currencies won’t do this via intervention or outright devaluation; instead, they’ll use interest rate cuts, which soften demand for their currencies and so have a similar effect. Central banks don’t even need to justify such cuts in currency terms; they’ll just note that a global trade war is undermining the domestic economic outlook.Already, New Zealand, India and Thailand have announced interest rate cuts in response to the renminbi’s decline. Meanwhile, bond markets are expressing investors’ worst fears: the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note is now almost below that of the three-month T-bill, ominously close to an “inverted yield curve,” which has traditionally signaled impending recession and much weaker monetary policy from the Federal Reserve.This low-interest environment is eating into banks costs. This is why Swiss bank UBS is now charging large depositors a fee to hold money at the bank – a negative interest rate play that angers savers.The scariest image here is not one of rebellion by angry rich savers, or even of a repeat of the heavy market turmoil of the 1997-98 Asian financial crisis or the even more extreme losses of 2008-2009. It’s that a currency war in which the U.S. is a deliberate belligerent would look more like the 1930s.That’s when the end of the gold standard and the U.S. Smoot-Hawley tariff law combined to spur a global cycle of devaluations that extended and widened the Great Depression. The ensuing international tensions fanned the flames of the Second World War.Of course, this is not the 1930s. We have a far more globalized economy, and we have the Internet. This greater interconnectivity, economists and political scientists often argue, will compel people, businesses and their politicians to resist conflict, economic or otherwise.But we also now know that interconnectivity, at least in its current “Web 2.0” format, has been highly disruptive to a political establishment that used to champion pro-globalization, pro-free trade policies.Google’s and Facebook’s centralized, data-mining algorithms have created echo chambers of dopamine-addicted group-thinkers, which, along with disinformation bots and “fake news,” have weakened the mainstream media outlets around which that establishment once revolved.Whether you’re cheering for its demise or not, the liberal vision of the nation-state is under threat, and that’s sowing chaos. On one side, the Internet has enabled new, transnational groups with loyalties that transcend their countries’ interests. On the other, this dislocation has fostered a backlash from defenders of the pre-liberal order of hardline state power.This same past week’s images of China’s violent crackdown in Hong Kong, where protesters desperately attempted to neutralize Beijing’s frightening digital surveillance, is a prime example. Another is Trump’s militaristic rhetoric.But here’s what also wasn’t around 80 years ago: cryptocurrency. People who worried in the 1930s about currency debasements, ethnic conflict or war destroying their wellbeing often turned to gold as a safe haven. Gold represented an ancient, widely recognized store of value whose properties, including its supply, were outside of the influence of turmoil-stoking governments.But now a citizen seeking a hedge against such threats has a digital alternative, one that’s far more appropriate for the Internet age, a vital bulwark against the centralized control of both banks and large Internet companies and against wayward governments.That alternative is bitcoin, whose digital properties are similar to those of “hard currencies” like gold: it’s hard to mine, provably scarce, fungible and transferable. Even better, as bitcoin bulls like to point out, the upcoming halving in bitcoin’s supply will put its stock-to-flow ratio above that of gold. (I’d say that should be priced in, however; I don’t see it as a reason, in and of itself, to buy now.)Why bitcoin and not some more recent, technically superior altcoin? Because, as with gold’s preeminence over silver as a safe haven, bitcoin has by far the biggest community of believers in its capacity to protect a holder’s wealth from political incursions. It’s this shared belief that gives bitcoin its power, a point poorly understood by those who erroneously argue that software forks undermine its digital scarcity. (Exhibit A: Bitcoin Cash’s market cap compared with bitcoin’s.)Herein lies the “buy bitcoin” argument for this current moment: that, regardless of your own beliefs, a sufficiently large number of other people now believe bitcoin to be the best way to hedge against political-economic turmoil in the global financial system.It’s tempting to say this mindset helped drive bitcoin’s price higher after Monday’s currency market news. But it’s always been difficult to correlate bitcoin’s day-to-day movements to real-world move.More important is the fact that bitcoin has not sold off in recent months as other real-world assets have come under pressure – a result that possibly counteracts an argument I made a year ago  that global financial market jitters would first spark a selloff, as bitcoin would be lumped into widespread risk aversion, with a recovery only once it had established its credentials as hedge against politics. Perhaps the departure of many newbie speculators who bought in during the crypto mania of 2017 has left the market in the hands of a more die-hard core of true-believing HODLers.Still, it would be foolish to assume the path from here is straight upwards. One major risk to that view is that of a profound, sweeping regulatory backlash, a jump into what Nic Carter of has labeled the phase of “full criminalization.”The idea is that governments, seeing investment outflows accompanying the financial turmoil, will worry about bitcoin enabling capital flight and so seek to ban it or at least introduce restrictions on exchanges that make the on- and off-ramps very difficult to use.For sure, a global regulatory backlash can’t kill the censorship-resistant “Honeybadger of money,” which is these kinds of situations do make a strong case for owning it in the long run.But for now, the best prediction is that market volatility will continue.Image Credit: Evan El-Amin / Shutterstock.com"

That’s before most of the bitcoin SV moved to a new blockchain in an upgrade known as a “hard fork,” executed on July 24th, which increased the blockchain’s block size parameter to 2 GB with the goal of increasing transaction volume.It’s unclear why these nodes have failed to upgrade. It could because they didn’t know they simply didn’t get the memo, they forgot they were running an older version or their operators simply didn’t agree with the changes in the hard fork and opted to protest.Bitcoin SV, a cryptocurrency not to be confused with bitcoin, is the brainchild of entrepreneur Craig Wright, who maintains that he created bitcoin (despite a range of security experts debunking his cryptographic proof). Wright is also currently embroiled in a lawsuit in the US that centers in part around the question of his claims to the Satoshi Nakamoto mantle.“There was a hard fork on BSV […] which resulted in a chain split, the new hard fork rules chain and the original rules chain. Most of the BSV economy and miners followed the new hard fork chain. The old original chain still exists, but has little economic significance, other than miners wasting money mining on it,” a representative of BitMEX Research, a wing of one of cryptocurrency’s largest exchanges, told CoinDesk.Whether or not this metric matters matters has been up to debate after several other hard forks.To oversimplify a complex debate, some argue hard forks are a clean upgrading mechanism for enhancing blockchains with new features, while detractors argue that hard forks can only be executed successfully by more centralized blockchains. On the other hand, the old chain is now pretty much dead.At first, bitcoin SV temporarily forked, with miners on the old chain mining more than 50 blocks, leading said miners to lose their block rewards. But now, at least the vast majority of miners have upgraded, so no more blocks are being created on the old blockchain.But while critics might argue that the blockchain is leaving nodes behind. This is in line with bitcoin SV’s view that miners, not nodes, are what are important in the network.“Power has now shifted to the miners to decide their own limits. […] Moving responsibility of the limits of the system to the miners means that the market itself, chooses what is best for the system. It is not for developer groups to decide market forces, but for the market itself,” CoinGeek developer Eli Afram told CoinDesk.Leaving nodes behind wasn’t the only other complication during this period. Last weekend, a significant portion of bitcoin SV nodes had problems processing a 210 MB block. Those nodes were stuck and were unable to send or relay transactions on the bitcoin SV network.The problem in part was due to large size of the block – but it’s a bit more complicated than that.“The main cause of the problems with the large 210 MB block was not necessarily the large size, as bitcoin SV had other large blocks in the past, but that it contained a lot of transactions, which used a lot of memory to validate. Previous large blocks on bitcoin SV had a lot of large OP_Return data, which is much easier to validate compared to ‘normal transactions’,” BitMEX Research told CoinDesk.Critics see this as another sign of centralization of the system because less nodes are having no trouble with blocks. But those in the bitcoin SV community don’t see this is a problem.“What happened is that some cheap nodes dropped off the network,” Afram said.Either way, most nodes have recovered since then.“The nodes eventually got [past] the block or gave up it seems,” a representative from BitMEX Research told CoinDesk.Bigger blocks have had an impact on bitcoin SV in other ways as well. Money Button CEO Ryan X. Charles, one of the more influential bitcoin SV proponents, disclosed that because of how expensive running a bitcoin SV node is becoming due to the data storage requirements caused by bigger blocks, they’re not going to run one anymore.“Our new instance will cost thousands of dollars per month to operate. As blocks continue to get larger and we have to upgrade the instance many times, this cost will balloon,” Charles explained.This decision further flared debate. The more full nodes there are, the more decentralized the network is. MoneyButton’s decisions perhaps shows that bitcoin SV full nodes are growing too fast data-wise for everyday users to run.But again, this is in line with bitcoin SV’s vision that miners are the important players. And next year, bitcoin SV plans to increase the block size for the last time.As Afram told CoinDesk:“I look forward to when the [block size] cap is removed altogether next year, so that Bitcoin can grow completely unbounded, and undeterred by crony developers, and we never have to have this [hard fork] discussion again.”nChain CEO Jimmy Nguyen via BitcoinSV.io"

According to a Bantotal spokesperson, an estimated 20 million people use Bantotal’s money management services.“Bantotal is one of the biggest banking providers in Latin America and is a huge player not just in Latin American but the greater Pacific,” said Sebastián Olivera, founder of the Uruguayan Fintech Chamber. “For me, Bitex provides a great solution for payments and they will be boosted by the structure and name of Bantotal.”The partnership means that Bantotal clients will be able to access Bitex services in a marketplace of other traditional financial services that Bantotal offers through its BDevelopers program.“With this technology, banks can have access to an API and have control of the whole process of [cross-border] payment with visibility and reliability on the bitcoin blockchain,” said Beaudroit.Calling it a “quantum leap” forward for local banks in Latin America, Beaudroit said that average fees associated with cross-border payments are up to five times cheaper using Bitex than international wire transfers.What’s more, these transfers are significantly faster, according to Beaudroit, who said payment times for exporters between Argentina and Paraguay in one instance last February dropped from one month to one hour after switching to Bitex’s cross-border payment services.The partnership in the eyes of competitors such as Stellar, which also specializes in cross-border payments leveraging its own blockchain network, is seen as a positive signal.Lisa Nestor, the Stellar Development Foundation’s director of partnerships, told CoinDesk:“We think this announcement further validates the value financial institutions are recognizing in digital assets and distributed ledger technology for executing core banking activities, like international payments. It’s also no coincidence these product partnerships are being launched in the [Latin American] market where cross-border payments, even in neighboring nations, can be slow and expensive.”Bitex essentially acts as a middleman for national and regional banks to convert fiat payments into bitcoin then back into fiat, as opposed to completing multiple fiat-to-fiat conversions.“If I want to do a payment from Argentina to Chile, I don’t need to buy dollars with the Argentinian pesos then transfer the dollars to the U.S. then move the dollars to Chile and exchange them into Chilean pesos,” said Beaudroit. “I can just send a payment from Argentina to Chile directly [using bitcoin].”Calling it a system of “peer-to-peer banking,” Beaudroit explained that Bitex handles the conversion of local currencies into and from bitcoin, as well as, its ultimate dispersion into regional or national bank accounts.Normally, this process of transferring money across borders with local banks in Latin American can take anywhere from 48 to 96 hours depending on the specific bank branch and financial intermediaries used, according to Leo Elduayen, vice president of non-profit Bitcoin Argentina and founder of blockchain startup Koibanx.Elduayen described the full process of cross-border payments using Bitex as an end-to-end solution for banks, saying:“The purchase and [transfer] of bitcoin, Bitex does it all on your behalf. You as a user just send the money and Bitex takes care of the rest for you.”With the Bantotal partnership, Elduayen suspects that accessibility to Bitex services for consumers in Latin American will dramatically increase though there are a number of hurdles still left “to get banks on board.”To this, Olivera said that both know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) legislation is still a major issue for banks when it comes to using the bitcoin blockchain.Federico Ast, CEO of Buenos Aires-based arbitration startup Kleros, agreed – adding that regulatory uncertainty and seeing cryptocurrencies “as a fad” are still major barriers to entry for Latin American banks.“I have to be honest. I think this is just the first conversation,” said Olivera. “It’s too early to say whether banks will choose to operate with Bitex but it’s a good first step.”At the very least, both Ast and Olivera see this partnership between Bantotal and Bitex as an opportunity to expose consumers in Latin American to the benefits of blockchain technology and help rebuild consumer trust in existing financial institutions.“Historically, Latin America has had weak financial systems,” said Ast. “There’s a history of bank runs with some sad highlights of confiscation of people’s saving (e.g., Argentina in 2001). … This agreement will lead to lower costs for consumers and higher financial inclusion.”Bitex’s Beaudroit has high hopes this partnership will also contributed to increasing the national GDPs of Latin American countries by enabling more commerce to flow “in a peer-to-peer fashion.”In this way, Santiago Siri, founder of digital governance startup Democracy Earth and advisor to Bitex, said the work of Bitex went far beyond simply being a crypto exchange platform.Said Siri:“It’s an ideal partner for banks to use bitcoin … as a way of connecting banks in a way that is not very common in the industry yet is fundamental for markets like Latin America.”Peruvian dance image via Shutterstock"

facilitate no-fee currency transfers. Customer deposits were held by 
Barclays.","Aug 14, 2019 at 01:08 UTC",The most prestigious banking relationship in crypto has ended.,"Barclays, the London-based global bank, is no longer working with cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, industry sources told CoinDesk. And while Coinbase found a replacement in U.K. upstart ClearBank, according to people familiar with the situation, the change has indirectly inconvenienced the exchange’s users.That’s because, aside from the cachet of working with a household-name bank, Barclays connected San Francisco-based Coinbase to the U.K. Faster Payments Scheme (FPS), enabling users to instantly withdraw and deposit British pounds at the exchange. The end of the relationship disrupted Coinbase’s access to FPS – which in turn slowed deposits and withdrawals in GBP for U.K. customers, which now take days to process.The situation is temporary, though, thanks to Coinbase’s new relationship with ClearBank. One of the U.K. “challenger banks” that have sprouted up in recent years to compete with market incumbents, ClearBank is expected to restore Coinbase’s FPS access by the end of the third quarter.Barclays, ClearBank and Coinbase all declined to comment.Companies that handle cryptocurrency have a tough time getting banking partners, with almost all big-name banks eschewing that business.Hence, when Coinbase obtained a bank account with Barclays in early 2018, the news was greeted with some fanfare. The exchange was also granted an e-money license by the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and was the first crypto firm to gain access to FPS.Since then, word on the street is that Barclays got cold feet about crypto clients; people have varying opinions on why this might be the case, but nobody knows for sure.“It is my understanding that Barclays’ risk appetite has contracted a little – I’m not sure exactly why or what’s been driving that, maybe there has been some activity they are not happy with. But it’s about Barclays’ comfort level with crypto as a whole,” said the CEO of a U.K. crypto company who chose to remain nameless.Another source described the Coinbase-Barclays relationship as a pilot program that has simply run its course.This source added that being banked by Barclays had probably held Coinbase back in terms of which coins and tokens the exchange wanted to list, and the time taken before the bank could feel comfortable with new assets being added.That’s not to say ClearBank is giving Coinbase carte blanche.Earlier this week, Coinbase de-listed zcash, the privacy-centric cryptocurrency, which uses a technology called zero-knowledge proofs to mask details of transactions from blockchain watchers. A person familiar with the decision said it was “completely to do with the new bank”; ClearBank was uncomfortable indirectly supporting a currency with features that make law enforcement’s job harder.Coinbase was not the only crypto company to successfully woo Barclays. In 2016, when the bank was perhaps more enthusiastic about the technology, Barclays said it was working with Circle Internet Financial, whose main offering at the time was Circle Pay, an FCA-regulated app that used bitcoin to help facilitate no-fee currency transfers. Customer deposits were held by Barclays.Barclays said at that time: “We can confirm that Barclays Corporate Banking has been chosen as a financial partner by Circle, and we support the exploration of positive uses of blockchain that can benefit consumers and society.”Both Barclays and Circle (which has since shifted its focus from retail payments to crypto trading) declined to comment on the status of their relationship.In addition to working with Barclays, Coinbase has had a banking relationship with Estonia-based LHV Bank for a number of years. LHV has been working to offer access to Faster Payments in the U.K. but, according to industry sources, this might still be a ways off.A spokeswoman for LHV told CoinDesk: “We have technically joined the Faster Payments scheme, but there are still some issues we have to work on and legal details to manage before we can start offering Faster Payments to our fintech clients.”Elsewhere in the U.K., FCA-regulated crypto broker BCB Group is also working with ClearBank. The broker recently announced a deal to bring Luxembourg-based exchange BitStamp onto Faster Payments for GBP.Oliver von Landsberg-Sadie, BCB’s founder and CEO, told CoinDesk: “All our clients’ GBP funds clear within 60 seconds both ways via FPS; Bitstamp is likely to be set up internally to pass that benefit on to their GBP customers (by processing payment information as fast as they receive it).”Another popular route into Faster Payments is via FCA-regulated Enumis, which recently began working with Coinfloor, the U.K.’s longest running exchange, to broker banking relationships for crypto companies.Also acting as an Enumis intermediary is U.K.-based Cashaa, which is helping to get banking and FPS access to projects on Binance Chain, the blockchain created by the world’s largest crypto exchange.Despite its de-risking of crypto, Barclays still offers operational banking services to Blockchain, the U.K. wallet provider which recently announced plans to move into the exchange space with its super-fast PIT trading service.Blockchain did not say by press time if its Barclays account was the means by which the firm would bring Faster Payments to its new exchange business.Barclays HQ image via Shutterstock"

forthcoming guidance on crypto taxes might say. While the letters are 
not ...","Aug 12, 2019 at 08:00 UTC",The Takeaway:,"As U.S. cryptocurrency users eagerly await tax guidance from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), they can find hints of what may come in the agency’s recent warning letters.The tax collector said earlier this year that its first guidance on crypto since 2014 is coming, but it’s not clear what information will be provided or when it will be published. (IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig said at the end of May that guidance could come “within the next 30 days,” but that loose deadline passed.)Yet the three form letters, sent last month by the IRS to more than 10,000 crypto traders, asked taxpayers to verify that they filed their taxes due on crypto gains and losses correctly, or amend their tax filings (one under penalty of perjury). And reading between the lines, the letters suggest changes in the agency’s approach to the asset class when compared to past public statements.Take, for example, how the three new letters instruct traders to calculate the fair market value of cryptocurrency holdings.The letters tell traders to look at the exact date and time they conducted a transaction, diverging from its guidance from 2014, which said to apply “the exchange rate, in a reasonable manner that is consistently applied.”As an illustration, say you bought 5 bitcoin on April 10, 2015. The 2014 guidance says to pick a price at some point during the day and use that to calculate fair market value. Bitcoin opened at a price of $243.69, fell as low as $232.77 and closed at $236.07, according to CoinMarketCap. Any of these prices could work, as long as all calculations for all taxes were consistent.The recent letters instead direct you to look at the exact time you bought the 5 bitcoin and use the price at that time to calculate the value.That’s more sensible, in the view of James Foust, a senior research fellow at industry advocacy group Coin Center.“If someone has multiple transactions over the course of a day and there’s significant volatility it doesn’t make sense to apply the same daily exchange rate, and also it could result in some weird outcomes,” Foust said.However, this may pose an issue for traders who now have to find this information, said Sean Ryan, chief technology officer and co-founder at crypto tax software provider Node40.He noted that the letters call for taxes on transactions conducted between 2013 and 2017, adding:“Now they say date and time and that does matter because we know that virtual currencies fluctuate minute-to-minute, trade-to-trade. So by saying it’s no longer susceptible to ‘date accurate’ and has to be ‘date and time accurate’ it throws a wrench in the system because they have to go back and find that [information].”The letters also diverge from past efforts to collect information about crypto traders.The IRS has previously asked exchanges to generate 1099-K forms for customers, which are usually used for payment settlement organizations, Foust noted, meaning merchants receiving revenue through a particular income stream.“That’s not helpful for paying taxes because the overwhelming majority of [customers] are not receiving payments on exchanges, they’re buying digital currencies,” he said. It could also lead to confusion with buys and sells. Foust explained:“Say you buy for $10,000 and sold for $9,000, the IRS would see that as you received a payment for $9,000, not a $1,000 loss.”“It’s not super-clear why the IRS … decided to get the exchanges to use the 1099-K form to report this customer information but that’s sort of the world that we’re in right now,” Foust added.The exchanges generating the 1099-K forms would provide them to both the taxpayer and the IRS, but the information included “is almost never going to be correct,” Ryan said.By specifying a different schedule, and therefore different form, in one of the letters, the IRS is essentially saying that the correct form is actually the 1099-B, he said.According to Ryan, one of the schedules listed in one of the letters is Schedule D, which is for reporting gains and losses from capital assets.The letter itself notes that “if you sold, exchanged, or disposed of virtual currency (e.g. Bitcoin, Ether), or used it to pay for goods or services, you have engaged in a reportable transaction.”The information that needs to be reported would be listed in form 8949, which in turn would normally derive its data from the 1099-B, Ryan said.Foust added that if an exchange were to provide a 1099-B, “you often don’t have to [fill out] form 8949 at all because the 1099-B is supposed to give you all that information.”Like with the 1099-K, exchanges would also provide that information to the IRS.Foust noted that the IRS’s letters are not actual guidance, but still, “it’s nice guidance to get.”“It’s the kind of thing you would hope would come in the form of guidance and not in the form of educational letters sent to a few thousand taxpayers and [everyone else] has to read the tea leaves,” he added.Lisa Zarlenga, a partner at law firm Steptoe & Johnson who focuses on taxes and related issues, said it is likely that the IRS group developing new guidance is not coordinating with whichever team wrote the letters. Any new guidance will have to pass through several layers of approval, including the U.S. Treasury Department (which the IRS falls under).Any individual who received a letter likely did so because the IRS has evidence that they made cryptocurrency trades, she said.“Some people are complaining, ‘well you haven’t issued guidance, therefore, you shouldn’t be enforcing,’” she said. “These letters are saying ‘if you use virtual currency and you made a gain from it you should be reporting.’”The IRS did not respond to a request for comment by press time.Zarlenga said the letters may not be inconsistent with past guidance. In her view, the IRS is most likely just looking for individuals who did not report any gains or losses from crypto transactions, despite having conducted them.“I don’t think this indicates a change in their position at all. I think these letters are getting at basic reporting on gains and losses in the use of cryptocurrency,” she said.By and large, last month’s letters aren’t even “treading new ground,” Zarlenga said. Taxpayers need to be able to indicate when they bought a cryptocurrency, when they sold it, how much it cost when they bought it and how much it cost when they sold, the letters said.The U.S. is in good company trying to collect taxes from its crypto-trading residents. The U.K.’s HM Revenue and Customs recently asked crypto exchanges to provide information about their customers, including transaction history, while the Australian Tax Organization announced in April it would collect data to help ensure residents paid the appropriate amount of tax.All three countries are members of the J5, a multinational collaboration between tax agencies to combat money laundering and other illicit behavior. Cryptocurrencies are one stated focus for the group.Since its first (and so far only) official guidance on crypto taxes in 2014, the IRS has offered glimpses as to how taxpayers can file returns through other actions, such as its requests for information from exchanges like Coinbase.However, even last month’s warning letters leave some of the largest questions around paying taxes on crypto unanswered, Foust said.“We’re sort of in an unfortunate situation right now because the IRS hasn’t provided substantive guidance on how people are supposed to report their virtual currency transactions and calculate what their tax burden is,” he said.The implications, he added, are:“People are being put in a position where they’re being asked to certify in one of those letters certify under penalty of perjury that they’ve [abided by] rules that haven’t been published yet.”The most obvious question revolves around forks, or events that create a new cryptocurrency available to holders of an old one, Ryan said.“The IRS has been completely silent on ‘now is that income? You just doubled your quantity, not your value, your quantity,’” he said. “If they’re going to consider that income they have to tell you how to assign cost basis because there’s no trading history.”In his view, forks should not be considered income.Likewise, the tax treatment of airdrops, or giveaways of a cryptocurrency to spur adoption, remains an open question.Depending on the circumstances, a taxpayer may or may not be able to opt in to receiving tokens through an airdrop.If a wallet provider or other service automatically airdrops tokens to all users, Ryan said, that should not be considered income.On the other hand, he said, “if you opt in to an airdrop I think you should report that as income.”IRS image via Shutterstock"

The other factors that can influence our timeline is the regulators’ views on these products.”In his statement, Liston said that once testing is concluded successfully and regulators have reviewed, the company “will be able to launch a much needed margined, physically-settled digital asset derivative to U.S. customers.”A number of firms are looking to offer physically-settled bitcoin derivatives, in which clients receive the actual bitcoin underlying a contract on expiration, in the U.S.  To date, LedgerX is the only one to provide swaps and options products, which it offers to institutional clients, and opened a platform targeting retailers in recent weeks.However, Seed CX wants to become the first to offer physically-settled products on margin, meaning investors can enter a leveraged position.The company has previously announced its intention to offer bitcoin forwards, a product similar to the bitcoin futures that Intercontinental Exchange’s Bakkt, LedgerX and ErisX are hoping to offer customers. TrueDigital is also looking to launch bitcoin forwards.While futures are standardized contracts traded on an exchange, forwards can be customized between parties and are traded over-the-counter. Clients can use both to bet on the price of bitcoin at some future date.According to Tuesday’s press release, Seed CX intends to offer nine different contracts simultaneously: four weekly contracts, three serial monthly contracts and two quarterly monthly contracts. Weekly contracts will expire on Fridays, while the monthly and quarterly monthly contracts will expire on the third Friday of the relevant months.Seed CX, the parent firm to Seed SEF, launched a bitcoin spot trading market in January, offering institutional clients trading and settlement services.Seed CX office courtesy Seed CX"

The digital currency would boost circulation of the yuan, including internationally, he added.As previously reported, the large number of patents filed by the PBoC relating to its digital currency paint a picture of how it might work. They suggest the work addresses a technology that issues a digital currency, as well as provides a wallet that stores and transacts the asset in an “end-to-end” fashion.The patents indicate the wallet would store a digital currency issued by the central bank or any authorized central entity that is encrypted like a cryptocurrency with private keys, offers multi-signature security and is held by users in a decentralized way.At the latest count, there have been 52 patents filed under the name of the Digital Currency Research Lab of the PBoC, with the latest published in Oct. 9 2018, having been submitted on March 26. 2018.PBoC image via Shutterstock"

This comes as the startup’s first funding round since it split off from the Patientory Association, a nonprofit created after the May 2017 initial coin offering (ICO) of ethereum-based PTOY tokens raised $7.2 million.“With the token, it basically regulates the storage in each node,” Chrissa McFarlane, Patientory CEO and president of the Patientory Association, told CoinDesk about her company’s token-oriented pilot programs. “You’re providing storage space and also paying for the transactions.”That said, few people currently use the token for anything beyond experiments.McFarlane said that beyond the holdings given to the founding team and nonprofit, she doesn’t know who is trading PTOY tokens these days on external exchanges like Upbit and Bittrex. According to CoinMarketCap, the price of PTOY plummeted in January 2018 and has remained at a pittance ever since, a fraction of a penny compared to a peak of $0.67 each in the bull market of December 2017.However, Patientory doesn’t rely on users owning tokens. To the contrary, McFarlane said she accepts fiat payments from prospective clients and purchases tokens on their behalf to facilitate transactions. Node operators can earn these tokens as a reward for providing storage space to other network participants, but usage isn’t mandatory.“We do not put data on the blockchain. Think of it as decentralized storage,” McFarlane said. Once the blockchain system is integrated with the hospital medical records, the data is encrypted and sharded so that the Patientory network basically acts like road signs for queries.Her goal is to have data across different healthcare providers managed under the patient’s private key, so the patient can grant providers nearly instant access. Almost 350 users have tested the startup’s beta mobile app, which can include subscription features like personalized health tips, since it launched in late 2018.Dylan Boyd, director of new programs at the Oregon Enterprise Blockchain Venture Studio (OEBV), told CoinDesk that R/GA Ventures’ investment came by way of a partnership between the firm and his Portland-based studio. He added McFarlane’s startup was chosen because she managed ICO funds in a “meaningful way.”“Her fortitude to work through the [bear market] is pretty impressive,” Boyd said.After the completion of the Series A, the Patientory ecosystem will have raised roughly $12.4 million to date, from the ICO to the latest venture capital round.McFarlane told CoinDesk roughly a third of the ICO funds went toward the nonprofit’s marketing and conference budget, such as recruiting and participating in Dubai’s BlockHealth Summit in April. About 20 percent went toward developing the startup’s app, with seven developers on staff.She added the remaining 45 percent of the ICO funds are under the nonprofit’s management, predominantly ether reserves along with 5 percent in conservative, traditional investment products.So far, most of the ICO funds were spent establishing the nonprofit, with three board members, four institutional members and a dozen ambassadors promoting the blockchain solution abroad. Unlike most token-funded nonprofits, the Patientory Association is based in Silicon Valley instead of Switzerland or elsewhere offshore.Most of the new Series A round will go toward developing the mobile app with more features, McFarlane said. However, any hint of profitability is a future projection at this point.BlockInterop CEO Gina Malak, who spearheads a complementary token project focused on healthcare apps, told CoinDesk she is a PTOY holder who plans to run a node, pay for Patientory’s blockchain-as-service offerings and collaborate on workshops through the Patientory Association.Both business leaders are black women entrepreneurs who turned to token sales because, as reported by Fast Company, researchers estimate less than 1 percent of traditional venture capital funding went to black women in 2018.  Malak said:“As an entrepreneur I found tokens sales offer several advantages and could open more doors for funding opportunities.”So far, Patientory doesn’t have any paying clients. But it does have a slowly growing community of contributors.With regards to association members, Boardmember Jonathan Fuchs told CoinDesk these members are involved with focus groups to brainstorm compliant solutions for sharing sensitive healthcare data.“The federal standards for interoperability are in final stages of development,” Fuchs said. “Support groups remain integral to the testing, feedback and implementation of systems’ interoperability capabilities in a very complex and integrated healthcare ecosystem.”Also along those lines, OEBVS’s Boyd said Patientory is participating in an OEBVS program to explore research opportunities with partners like Oregon Health Science University and ConsenSys.The startup also has ongoing pilot programs with partners that run their own nodes, including Navicent Health, Moda Health and IrisGuard, the latter of which ran an aid distribution program with the United Nations in 2017 to serve refugees in Jordan. Patientory is also pursuing opportunities with the Dubai Health Authority.BlockInterop’s Malak described both her own startup and McFarlane’s as “embarking on a similar path.”Speaking to the benefits of joining the Patientory Association, with access to healthcare industry experts and support groups related to systems compliance, she added:“I feel that together we have formed a strong strategic alliance that will empower patients and bring them to the center of their healthcare.” Chrissa McFarlane image via Patientory"

futures platform, only to find that the Commodity Futures Trading ...","Aug 11, 2019 at 09:35 UTC",Noelle Acheson is a veteran of company analysis and CoinDesk’s Director of Research. The opinions expressed in this article are the author’s own.,"The following article originally appeared in Institutional Crypto by CoinDesk, a free weekly newsletter for institutional investors interested in crypto assets. Sign up here.Last week’s kerfuffle over the launch-that-wasn’t of LedgerX’s physically delivered futures platform highlights two very important lessons, one obvious and one less so.The obvious conclusion is that one needs to tread very carefully when it comes to claiming regulatory approval. LedgerX announced the launch of its retail physically delivered bitcoin futures platform, only to find that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) had not yet approved a necessary amendment to its clearing license. Tensions flared and the launch was subsequently walked back.The confusion over the licensing process is a hindrance, but an understandable one given the complexity of the new products (physically settled bitcoin futures have many more moving parts than traditional futures, even beyond the custody issue). And the “ask for forgiveness rather than permission” approach to financial innovation is probably going to end up expensive.Below I want to focus on the less obvious takeaway: the role of regulations in determining eventual market structure, and the danger of unintended consequences.Obviously, established rules can encourage or discourage the take-up of new financial products. The LedgerX confusion, though, highlights a different type of barrier, also heavily influenced by regulation, but one based on relative risk rather than investor protection.I’m talking about the difference between swaps and futures. In conversation with CoinDesk, Paul Chou pointed out that “the difference between futures and swaps is ridiculous, it’s the same product.” This is not true. While their hedging and speculative properties may be identical and their economic outcomes similar, in the eyes of regulators they are very different.Before digging into why, let’s pull apart the semantics. A “future” is an agreement to pay a certain price for something at a fixed point in the future. A “swap,” on the other hand, is the commitment to exchange cash flows. In bitcoin, this could mean something as simple as “I’ll send you fixed payments in exchange for variable payments based on the bitcoin price.” Structured a certain way, the net effect could be the same as a futures contract.But the markets are very different. Futures are standardized products that trade on exchanges. Swaps, on the other hand, evolved as bilateral contracts negotiated between two parties. They traded over-the-counter in opaque markets until the 2008 crisis revealed the size of the outstanding risk and the convoluted web of obligations that had not taken counterparty default into consideration.The Dodd-Frank financial regulation bill, enacted by Congress in 2010, mandated that most swaps move towards a standardized model and be traded on and cleared by centralized intermediaries. The aim was to add transparency and reduce risk, while enhancing liquidity. The result was a bifurcated derivatives system that skews development momentum in the direction of futures.Why? Because of cost.Centrally cleared financial swaps require a much** higher margin than futures. In part, this is most likely due to the perceived relative illiquidity in swaps.It could also be to compensate the additional risk to clearing houses. With futures, a trader will ask her futures commission merchant (FCM) to place a trade on a designated contract market (DCM), where it is executed and passed along to the clearing house. If a trader’s position goes spectacularly wrong, the risk to the clearing house is partially buffered by her funds held at the FCM and the margin deposited at the DCM.With swaps, FCMs can be used, but they are optional and a relatively new feature. Often, a trader will enter into a contract directly on a swap execution facility (SEF), which will then pass it on to a clearing house. All else being equal, fewer buffers means greater risk which justifies a higher required margin.In markets, however, all else is rarely equal, and some swap contracts are more liquid than some futures contracts, so there is considerable pressure to amend this rule as it is seen to unjustly favor futures over swaps.Furthermore, swaps are almost exclusively an institutional product, whereas futures are also traded by retail investors. Most other financial regulations operate on the assumption that institutions understand and accept extra risk – asking them to pay more than they deem fair will nudge their business into other product types.True, as always with financial regulation, there is a matrix of other causes and consequences to consider, and loopholes and exceptions keep lawyers busy.But the point is that regulatory decisions in financial markets often have unintended consequences which affect capital formation. The higher cost of swaps compared to futures has led to the “futurization of swaps,” in which a swap is wrapped in a future and traded as such, with lower margin requirements. This favors DCMs over SEFs, since the latter cannot trade futures and therefore cannot enter into this type of regulatory arbitrage. Many complain that this does not mitigate risk, it just redistributes it, to the detriment of sector diversification.Note that I am talking about non-crypto derivatives here. Bitcoin swaps and futures tend to have a much higher margin requirement than their traditional counterparts (maintenance margin for cash-settled bitcoin futures on the CME is 40 percent vs under 3 percent for gold futures). Rather than an attempt to dissuade investors from trading crypto products, this extra caution is deemed necessary given the assets’ heightened relative volatility. Fair enough.As the contention mentioned above shows, we need to keep an eye on regulatory decisions within** an asset class; what’s more, not just on what the regulator is doing today, but on what the unintended consequences could be.In the LedgerX case, we can glimpse the potential evolution of a sector structure that is probably not what either the regulators or service providers hoped for.In taking extra care with LedgerX’s clearing license, the CFTC is shining a light on the role clearinghouses will have in the crypto ecosystem. This additional scrutiny, and the hoops and hurdles that are being imposed, could lead to crypto asset clearinghouse concentration further down the line, as scrutiny and hurdles create barriers to entry and add to operating costs. More clearinghouse concentration will increase** risk rather than decrease it, by centralizing the potential for something to go very wrong. In this case, the unintended consequences could be the opposite of the original goal.An important factor is that LedgerX plans to sell bitcoin derivatives to institutional and retail investors. That generally makes the regulators sit up even straighter in their chairs, as protecting retail investors is a political imperative. So, we can expect even more care to be taken with settlement operations.Another consequence of the delay is to give other potential competitors a chance to catch up: ErisX and Bakkt, both with bigger backers, are also gearing up to offer physically delivered bitcoin futures. I’m not saying this is the intention, it’s more likely to be another “unintended consequence,” but a greater choice for investors lowers risk overall.In a fit of frustration, the CEO of LedgerX, Paul Chou, threatened to sue the CFTC over their handling of the approval. While it is generally not a good idea to be anywhere near Twitter when angry, attempting to sue the CFTC has precedent. In 2013, Bloomberg did just that over the “unfair” additional margin requirements for financial swaps vs futures that I mentioned earlier, which it saw as detrimental to the profit of its SEF. A court later threw out the suit.I’m neither a lawyer nor a regulator, but it’s likely that the result would be the same should LedgerX press ahead with its stated intention. It would have a hard time arguing – as Bloomberg did – that the CFTC is favoring one product over another, thus putting its business model in jeopardy. The firm already trades swaps for institutional investors. The delay is affecting its intention to broaden its offering to include futures and options, and its target market to include retail investors.It cannot even argue that the CFTC is anti-crypto. Outgoing Chairman Christopher Giancarlo has long been a thoughtful and informed advocate of innovation and blockchain technology’s potential.It’s likely that tempers will calm and the fuss will blow over. The eventual launch of physically delivered bitcoin futures, whoever is first to market, will add a layer of maturity to a rapidly evolving sector by offering an alternative hedging mechanism in a format the market has been waiting for. That, plus the lessons learned along the way, will push the sector forward.Meanwhile, we should all keep an eye on regulators’ actions – not on the obvious reasons, but on potential consequences and hidden messages.

contributor base (the second strongest is bitcoin). Up-and-comers: The ...","Aug 12, 2019 at 17:00 UTC",The Takeaway:,"The least committed contributors were the first to leave as cryptocurrency market caps went south.That’s the main finding from Electric Capital’s second “Developer Report,” which was published Monday. The report analyzes code activity in all the open-source repositories in crypto and follows the venture capital firm’s first such report from March.While there’s a sense that protocols and projects have been losing code contributors, the majority of developers that left crypto during the market correction in the first half of 2019 (77 percent of them) were the least committed contributors to the least promising projects.Meanwhile, total commits really haven’t gone down.“The mystery we’re really trying to unravel here is why commits have stayed very, very consistent through crypto winter even though high-level developers have decreased,” Maria Shen, who leads data science for Electric Capital, told CoinDesk in a phone call.In fact, Electric found that most of the total losses in developers were those doing the least amount of work. Meanwhile, more consistently contributing developers have kept the overall contributions consistent even as the developer total shrank.Electric Capital’s research spanned over 27,000 code repositories, with additional work added in to cull duplicate entries and low-level contributions that tend to inflate real developer activity. The researchers also de-duplicated developers who contributed to more than one project, though by and large, these were rare.The principal insight, according to Electric Capital, came in dividing developers into three groups:The top 100 projects lost only 4 percent of their total developers while the rest lost 19 percent. Across the board, the less often a developer made commits, the more likely they were to quit making contributions.Nevertheless, monthly commits into the code base in 2019 never dropped below the levels seen in the early part of 2017’s crypto boom, in no small part because the total number of developers contributing on 10 or more days each month has ticked up slightly, ending at 2,455 in June 2019.“It’s a useful breakdown to keep track of since the total number of developers declining doesn’t tell the full story,” Linda Xie of Scalar Capital told CoinDesk.“Fifty percent of the drop [in total developers] is from people who committed one commit in a month. That for me was a key takeaway of the data,” Avichal Garg, co-founder of Electric, told CoinDesk.More importantly, the team notes that market downturns among the major blockchains over the last year only served to slow the accumulation of part-time and full-time developers. New developers continued to join the top 100 projects, though at a slower pace when prices were down.Which means that, if crypto really is at the beginning of an upturn, “way more developers should rush in over the next two or three years,” Garg said.It’s also important to note that there are a number of early projects out there (such as Near, Coda and Oasis) that have not yet posted their code into open repositories, so there could be some undercounting. Nevertheless, Electric believes its data is “directionally” informative.Further, it’s also worth noting that the analysis made efforts to include any project that’s contributing to a given blockchain, not just direct commits to the underlying protocol (such as applications and infrastructure efforts that aren’t directly in the core code).With 100 pages primarily devoted to graphs and charts, there is a lot of information to glean from studying this report.Here are a few points that stood out:“Developers who have been really building in the ecosystem have continued to build,” Shen said, “and these ecosystems are incredibly strong.”Broadly speaking, Garg argues that this report’s findings are encouraging for the whole ecosystem. Tactically, he said, this kind of work helps his company identify projects that are neglected by the broader investment community.Further, he said there have been some industry-wide assumptions that this research supports with real data. For example, that decentralized finance is attracting a lot of interest and that the very low-quality projects from the initial coin offering (ICO) boom are stagnating or dying.“This data is generally valuable for everyone to quantify these intuitions we all have,” Garg said.Garg also pointed to some surprises in the data.For example, that Grin’s developer community has held on despite waning interest in crypto more broadly. Additionally, that EOS did well at attracting committed developers, despite meeting general skepticism across the industry.Critically, Garg said, across the history of the technology industry, engineers are a leading indicator of winning companies and dominant software. That’s why Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft all fight so fiercely to attract and retain talent. He believes the same will prove to be true in crypto.Said Garg:“Where the developers aggregate, that’s where value aggregates.”Electric Capital co-founder Avichal Garg speaks at Consensus 2019 (photo via CoinDesk archives)"

They also explored possible ways to regulate the energy-intensive mining process and to integrate blockchain technology in current energy systems.Some of the opportunities for blockchain include placing utility bill transactions on a smart grid, supporting electric vehicle charging infrastructure, and distributing energy resources.“Traditionally electric utilities are vertically integrated. Blockchain could disrupt this convention by unbundling energy services along a distributed energy system,” according to the report. This could lead to greater industry transparency, efficiency, and competition among energy producers.Additionally, blockchain could increase consumer choice in the energy market. For instance, the researchers cite the ability to purchase excess energy “produced by their neighbor’s solar panels.”In April, the U.S. Department of Energy announced a $4.8 million funding grant for universities to research and develop blockchain use cases for the energy sector.The agency calculated that nearly 1 percent of the country’s electricity generating capacity goes towards mining cryptocurrencies, a rate they observed increasing year over year. The researchers noted that crypto mining can burden a municipality’s power structure and increase consumer rates.For instance, in Plattsburgh, New York, it was found that crypto mining “contributed to an increase of nearly $10 to monthly electricity bills in January 2018 for residential customers.” This surge in energy use contributed to an 18-month moratorium on any new cryptocurrency mining operations in the city.Additionally, citing a study published in “Nature Climate Change, vol. 8,” the researchers claimed that “the associated energy consumption of Bitcoin usage could potentially produce enough CO2 emissions to lead to a 2 degree celsius increase in global mean average within 30 years.”However, the researchers provided counter arguments that crypto mining will continue to increase at an unsustainable rate, and suggested crypto’s energy consumption may be a “temporary issue.”According to the report:“Some argue that sustainability concerns due to energy consumption are misplaced, and that the competitiveness of Bitcoin mining means that only miners with the most competitive mining hardware and the lowest electricity costs will persist over time,” the agency writes. Additionally, “Some anticipate that energy demands will diminish as the reward incentive shifts from discovering new Bitcoin to earning revenue through transaction fees.”The researchers also argue that mining often occurs in locations with access to renewable sources of energy. Specifically, the state of Washington, provided between 15 and 30 percent of all Bitcoin mining operations globally in 2018 using hydroelectric sources of power. They also cite Mongolia, which gets 63 percent of its electric capacity from thermal power.Conversely, 58 percent of mining pools are located in China, where many of the active sites are powered by coal. The researchers cite the China’s National Development and Reform Commission, which called mining a “wasteful and hazardous” activity.To combat rising energy usage, the researchers option the viability of policies like “minimum energy conservation standards, voluntary energy efficiency standards, and data center energy efficiency standards,” for the crypto industry.While the country is currently a patchwork of different energy systems with equally varying regulations, Congress may pass unified legislation “to curb the energy intensity of the technology.” Some of the minimum standards considered may regulate ASIC chips or computer power usage generally.Also floated  was extending the voluntary ENERGY STAR specifications to mining gear, or submitting mining farms to the standards put forward by the Data Center Optimization Initiative (DCOI) that oversees energy usage of data centers.Additionally, the federal government may look to standards enacted at the state level, like those passed in March 2018, by the New York Public Service Commission, that ruled “municipal power authorities could issue a tariff on high-density-load customers—including cryptocurrency companies.”Though bitcoin mining represents an energy intensive process, the researchers found that “less energy intensive, alternative algorithms exist, such as proof of stake and proof of authority.”In August 2018, the U.S. Senate held a hearing to consider the energy efficiency of blockchain.Capital Building photo via CoinDesk archives"

The SEC further alleges he misappropriated at least $520,000 of investors’ money for personal use, as well as $600,000 to purchase precious metals to prop up another scam.In addition to freezing Middleton’s assets, the SEC asked the court to prohibit him from destroying or altering documents and place a lifelong ban his ever operating a public company or participating in a digital asset securities offering.According to the complaint, Middleton failed to register the VERI ICO with the SEC and claimed the coins were not securities, but investments in a technology platform or his personal brand. At several points, Middleton described VERI tokens as prepaid fees, software, or compared them to WalMart gift cards. This obfuscation, the SEC alleges, was an attempt to “skirt” the law.The allegations of market manipulation stem in part from “Middleton plac[ing] a series of secret, manipulative trades in VERI … artificially increasing VERI’s price by approximately 315% during just one day of trading. He then touted these price increases and returns to VERI holders,” the SEC said.Also, allegedly, yikes: manipulating unregistered tokens is going to be considered by the SEC as market manipulation per 15 U.S.C. § 78i, which is not something we've seen before in an unregistered ICO complaint as far as I can recall.https://t.co/mfoRqeywlZ pic.twitter.com/O6ZrGEIpOk— Preston Byrne (@prestonjbyrne) August 13, 2019Investors purchased 51 million tokens during the 2017 ICO, for 69,000 ether (valued at $14.8 million at the time), and continued to buy in based on Middleton’s material deceptions, the SEC said.As part of a misinformation campaign, Middleton said he had brokered deals with airlines, ultra-high net worth individuals, and “one of the largest stock exchanges in the Caribbean” to sell VERI for its various stated use cases, according to the SEC. In total, he claimed to have sold $35 million worth of tokens for institutional use.In fact, by June 2018, only 75 of the roughly 2 million tokens were “exchanged for research or any other services.”Middleton instead fabricated trading volume on the EtherDelta exchange to pump VERI’s price, the regulator said. He would then publicize the increasing volume or price to entice more investments.The SEC quotes an email Middleton sent to an employee, detailing the first known instance of market manipulation: “The EtherDelta market is not accurate because of the very, very low volume. I will try to push more volume in… [t]his time next month, I’ll probably have all (as in every single) hip hop and rap star/producer beat in net worth.”An additional $8 million of funds raised during the ICO are missing. In 2017, Middleton claimed hackers stole and liquidated the 36,000 tokens from company accounts.In a separate document. SEC attorneys wrote:And in just the last two weeks, after they learned that a Commission enforcement action against them was likely, Defendants transferred over $2 million of the remaining investor proceeds, at least in part to fund other endeavors.Specifically, Middleton allegedly began transferring 10,000 ETH (worth about $2.3 million) of investor funds to “other digital asset addresses,” and another 750 ETH (about $172,500) to his personal account days after the SEC informed Middleton’s lawyers they would recommend an enforcement action.SEC Complaint v Reggie Middleton by CoinDesk on ScribdDeception image via Shutterstock"

Four previous complaints were filed in California state court, but the company successfully moved to have these cases consolidated and shifted to federal court. Ripple has until Sept. 19 to file a response.“That filing will be the first time in the already-long history of this litigation that Ripple will substantively respond to the allegations around XRP,” said Jake Chervinsky, general counsel at crypto lending startup Compound Finance.The company has been in the legal crosshairs since May 2018, when investor Ryan Coffey filed the first of several lawsuits seeking class-action status against Ripple Labs, subsidiary XRP II, CEO Brad Garlinghouse and other individuals. XRP, which Ripple periodically sells, has “all the traditional hallmarks of a security,” Coffey claimed.Investors Vladi Zakinov, Avner Greenwald and David Oconer filed similar suits shortly thereafter. The lawsuits were combined and moved to federal court in November.While the suit has not yet been certified as a class action, law firms Susman Godfrey and Tayler-Copeland Law were appointed as co-lead counsel at the end of June, with investor Bradley Sostack being appointed as lead plaintiff. (Zakinov, Oconer and Greenwald were denied their own motion to be appointed as lead plaintiff.)The new amended complaint lays out “a strong case against Ripple,” said Chervinsky, noting that Susman Godfrey is “one of the best plaintiff’s law firms in the U.S.” In particular, he highlighted that the complaint claims XRP is a security under both federal and California state law.“This is important because California uses the ‘risk capital test’ in addition to the [federal] Howey test to determine whether a transaction qualifies as a security,” he explained. “The risk capital test is broader than the Howey test, meaning the plaintiffs could lose their federal securities claims and still win their state securities claims.”The plaintiffs’ complaint is trying to tie the XRP Ledger, the distributed network underlying XRP (and therefore the cryptocurrency’s price), back to Ripple, said Rebecca Rettig, a partner at the law firm of Fisher Broyles, which is not involved in the case.Ripple and Susman Godfrey declined to comment.Perhaps the most important difference between the new complaint and its predecessors is the citation of the SEC’s framework for analyzing whether a digital asset qualifies as a security.“The Complaint reads like a love letter to the SEC,” Chervinsky said. “Although the SEC’s Framework is technically only non-binding guidance, the Court will likely give it significant weight in deciding how to apply the Howey test to the facts of this case.”Rettig agreed, telling CoinDesk that “this is the first time we have seen the SEC’s Framework applied in a case in federal court.” She added:“Although the framework on its own doesn’t have precedential value – meaning the court is not required to follow it – it will be very interesting to see how the court handles the utility of the framework in moving forward in determining whether XRP is a security.”The SEC published the guidance in April, providing for the first time a specific roadmap for how it might assess digital assets.Over the course of 11 pages, the amended complaint details how the plaintiffs believe XRP is a security based on the framework, stating that “XRP purchasers made an investment of money in a common enterprise”; “XRP investors had a reasonable expectation of profits”; and “the success of XRP requires efforts of Ripple and others”.“Lead Plaintiff and the Class invested fiat and other digital currencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, to purchase XRP. As explained in the SEC Framework, investment of both fiat and digital currency meets the first prong of Howey,” the filing says.Ripple and its affiliated parties are the common enterprise, the complaint alleges, saying that any profit the potential class might see “are intertwined with the fortunes of Ripple.”The price of XRP is dependent on Ripple’s efforts, the lawsuit alleges. Investors would have expected the value of their holdings to grow based upon the efforts of the company.The complaint goes on to say:“Lead Plaintiff and the Class have entirely passive roles vis-à-vis the success of the XRP Ledger and XRP. Rather, as Defendants’ own marketing makes clear, the success of the XRP Ledger, and the profits the Class reasonably expected to derive from investing in XRP, are dependent on the essential technical, entrepreneurial, and managerial efforts of Defendants and their agents and employees.”Rettig noted that “each of the [factors in the SEC Framework] are based on underlying federal case law, so the litigants will likely rely upon these underlying cases and not simply the framework [itself].”Like past complaints, last week’s filing points to public statements made by Ripple executives such as CEO Brad Garlinghouse and CTO David Schwartz to bolster its argument.For example, Garlinghouse said in a 2017 CNBC interview that “people are looking at the success Ripple has been having as a company, and I think that’s increased the value of XRP,” according to the complaint.Elsewhere, the complaint says Garlinghouse “conceded” that Ripple’s own self-interest is tied up “with building and maintaining a healthy XRP market.”“The Complaint emphasizes Ripple’s own statements to prove that XRP investors had a reasonable expectation of profits flowing from Ripple’s managerial efforts,” Chervinsky noted. “This is similar to how the SEC framed its own Complaint against Kik,” the messaging app company that the SEC alleges violated securities laws when it raised $100 million during a 2017 token sale.Beyond interviews, the complaint cites tweets that the plaintiffs believe demonstrate that Ripple indicated XRP’s price would rise due to work the company was doing.Roughly 40 tweets are referenced in the filing, including tweets from the company, executives and other employees discussing exchange listings, Ripple’s XRP reserves and other marketing efforts. The complaint also references a Garlinghouse quote-tweet of a Motley Fool tweet which said companies using Ripple’s tools “could be a big deal for Ripple’s XRP cryptocurrency” as an example.“I’ve never seen so many citations to Twitter in a complaint before,” Chervinsky said.(The suit also notes that Digital Currency Group, which holds a stake in Ripple, is also the parent company of CoinDesk, and cites a 2017 article on this website reporting that XRP’s price had risen above $1 for the first time ever as “one of many instances in which Ripple would promote XRP price movements.” For the record: CoinDesk operates independently from the parent company, working in separate offices and maintaining strict policies on editorial independence and transparency.)Beyond simply promoting XRP, the complaint hints that Ripple may have gone as far as to mislead the general public about which of its various products were being adopted.“On April 26, 2017, Ripple tweeted a link to an article on its own site, proclaiming: ‘#Ripple welcomes 10 additional customers to our #blockchain #payments network.’ Neither this tweet nor the article it linked to informed readers that the blockchain payments network did not refer to the XRP Ledger, but rather Ripple’s xCurrent enterprise solution,” the complaint said, adding in the next paragraph:“Just days later, on May 3, 2017, with the price of XRP continuing to rise, Ripple tweeted: ‘#Ripple adoption is sparking interest in XRP ‘which has had an impressive rally in the last two months’ via @Nasdaq.'”Securities law aside, the lawsuit also adds new claims that have not appeared in previous filings in the case, Chervinsky noted.“For the first time, the plaintiffs now claim that Ripple violated California’s false advertising and unfair competition laws by making fraudulent statements about the genesis, circulating supply, and adoption of XRP,” he said.The fact that this complaint is in federal court may have helped the plaintiffs. Chervinsky explained:“Interestingly, the plaintiffs probably couldn’t have alleged those claims on behalf of a global ‘class’ — all persons or entities who purchased XRP — if Ripple had left the case in California state court instead of removing it to federal court.”According to the filing, Sostack and his fellow plaintiffs are looking for Ripple to reimburse them for their losses.For the lead plaintiff, those losses total $118,100, according to the complaint, but the full size of the losses allegedly incurred by the class has not yet been calculated.More significantly, the plaintiffs want the court to declare that XRP is a security, which could have an impact on Ripple’s ability to continue selling XRP from its reserves, as well as potentially limit who can acquire the token.Other prayers for relief include the plaintiffs wanting Ripple to pay for all legal fees and have the court award any other damages that might be warranted.Ripple now has 45 days from August 5 to answer the complaint, and could file a response (like Kik Interactive did to the SEC) or a motion to dismiss.Image via CB Insights YouTube"

Some of the network’s other governing members include Japanese financial holding company Nomura,  Deutsche Telekom and law firm DLA Piper. At this point in the network’s lifecycle, council members are invited by Hedera to join and given fee income for running nodes.IBM said it is most interested in how the public network interacts with private networks.“The most exciting part is the proposed Hedera Consensus Service,” said Bryan Gross, principal offering manager of the IBM Blockchain Platform.  “It has the potential to provide the core innovation of proof-of-work blockchains, like bitcoin and ethereum, without the performance and privacy trade-offs that are typically associated with these networks.”Since the Hedera Hashgraph is designed to unify public and private networks, IBM will use it to build trust in custom Hyperledger Fabric networks. (Big Blue contributed the Fabric platform to Hyperledger, an umbrella project for enterprise blockchains.)“Hedera Consensus Service makes it possible for Hyperledger projects out there to use the service to put transactions in order and eliminate the need for them to stand up nodes for transaction ordering, and they get the trust model of a public network,” Harmon said.Tata Communications, part of the Indian conglomerate Tata Group, could not be immediately reached for comment but said in a press release that it plans to use distributed ledger technology to improve operational efficiency.The addition of the two major firms will further decentralize Hedera’s governance, said Harmon.That governance includes a system of checks and balances that are supposed to prevent power from being consolidated at the network.Members of the council have equal say in approving updates to Hedera’s codebase and in setting policies for the network’s nodes.Council members can serve a maximum of two consecutive three-year terms if two-thirds of the council agrees to let them continue.Hedera’s source code is open for review, but patented – an arrangement intended to prevent forks.Hedera Hashgraph booth at Consensus 2019, image via CoinDesk archives"

The company aimed to mitigate the threats of the “retail apocalypse.” It also built an app to help small businesses manage paperless transactions and help locals discover local merchants.The company launched the token project in four cities, including London, Liverpool and Tel Aviv. It received an additional $14.5 million from financial and insurance company IDB Group for the project.Colu will repurchase the tokens in ether at the original crowd-sale ETH to CLN rate, which it notes “is higher than the current market exchange ratio.” The company has set a buy-back window of 90 days, after which the tokens will be burned.The company plans to create a website dedicated for the repurchase. It also says holders in several companies will be excluded, including those in the United States and Canada. Additionally, only those who complete KYC and AML processes will receive repayment.Culo recently launched the Belfast Coin, in partnership with Belfast City Council, and coin for use in the Municipality of Tel Aviv-Yafo. Neither project is blockchain-based and both will continue to operate.“The Colu Group is also in talks with a number of other municipalities across the world, about introducing similar initiatives,” according to a statement.Dan Ariely, professor of behavioral economics, told Crowdfund Insider:“Colu DLT’s decision to purchase CLN tokens appears unprecedented in the industry. It demonstrates how the Colu Group’s core values guide its actions. The Colu Group is focused on fostering relations between municipalities, local businesses, residents, and other city stakeholders. These relationships rely on the very same kind of trust and consideration, which is now being shown towards CLN token holders. It is wonderful to see the Colu Group following their ethical standards not just in words but in action. Such acts of giving up profits for the benefits of customers, partners, and investors are crucial to this tech sector if we want it to continue to evolve and grow.”Colu DLT’s Chairman of the Board of Directors, Amos Meiri, said “blockchain may yet help to” build trust between people and foster local economies.Disclaimer: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Colu.Coins image via CoinDesk archives "

The benefits include reducing time, cost and failure rate associated with making transactions whilst data is stored on a secure immutable ledger,” according to Laycock.The department is also to revamp its payments architecture – to introduce “the biggest set of changes to the way UK payment schemes process payments in years.” With a rollout planned to start  in 2021, the DWP will introduce a common payment message standard and consolidate existing schemes. New “overlay” services will also be added, including “request to pay” and “confirmation of payee.”Open banking – the use of open APIs to allow third-party developers to build apps and services around a banking institution – also offers a way to improve aspects of the DWP’s payment services.Laycock said:“I’m keen for us to consider how we can harness the payment innovations coming out of these trends and how we can influence the New Payment Architecture to help shape future of payments across government.”London image via Shutterstock"

It is designed as a for-profit currency of currencies,” Pistor said at the House Financial Services Committee on July 17.Pistor went on to describe the governance model of Facebook’s Geneva-based cryptocurrency project as a “concentration of power… unmatched by any meaningful accountability to anyone.” Though that’s less frightening than it sounds.Later, at an Q&A hosted by CoinDesk, Pistor explained that Libra could only be possible because of the regulatory infrastructure that already supports fiat currencies. Just as treasury bills and bank deposits are guarded by the reputation and “full faith of the United States behind” them, so too would Facebook’s stable cryptocurrency be ingratiated in the financial ecosystem. “[Facebook] can’t do this without the United States.”Libra, because of its streamlined and “elegant” design, “could eliminate a lot of things. It could be a lot cheaper. It could just be a much better system for many customers.” Ultimately, Pistor’s question becomes, “whether the central banks could actually offer something that’s more attractive.”“I think the really important question is what is the benefit of doing it through a private agent rather than a public agent,” she said."
