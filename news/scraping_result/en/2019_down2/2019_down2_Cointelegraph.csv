indicators of where Bitcoin price is headed. 35132 Total views.","Aug 12, 2019","Bitcoin price charting on a longer timeframe, market structure and the issuance of 1 billion Tether so far this year are making crypto and equities analyst FilbFilb incredibly bullish on BTC/USD in the run up to the 2020 halving. ","Since correcting from 2019’s all-time high of $13,800 and thrice failing to break above $12,500, crypto investors broke into three camps. The first took the bearish perspective and predicted a pullback to $8,500-$7,500, often citing the CME gap. The second envisioned a lengthy period of consolidation where Bitcoin price would remain pinned between $9,000 and $12,000, providing the opportunity for savvy traders and institutional investors to accumulate prior to the 2020 halving. The third group interpreted the parabolic breakdown as nothing more than a blip and remain steadfast in their belief that the digital asset will eventually rally back to $13,500 and higher. According to popular crypto and equities analyst FilbFilb, Bitcoin price has undergone a structural shift for several reasons, he explained in his weekly newsletter. Namely:  A break above $14,000 also represents a new 2019 all-time high and the news event surrounding this event could lead to an influx of capital from investors of various ilk. In combination, these factors make a strong bullish case for Bitcoin price in the run up to the May 2020 halving. However, FilbFilb also cautions that: “On lower time frames, the Adam and Eve target remains to play out, with $12.9k being the target.” As discussed previously, there is a noticeable lag between Tether issuance and Bitcoin’s corresponding price action. By starting at Tether’s market cap bottom and comparing this against the time it took Bitcoin to reach its 2018 bottom, FilbFilb’s notes that there is an approximately 32-day delay between Tether and Bitcoin’s price action. By anchoring Tether’s market cap bottom to Bitcoin’s market cap bottom, the 30-day lag between the two assets is smoothed out to the extent that it is easier to determine the correlation between each asset. Using Y=0.0002x+1.161, FilbFilb concluded that the correlation between Tether and Bitcoin is 0.89. Therefore, when applied to Tether’s current market cap of $4.34 billion, the model suggests that the price of Bitcoin should be somewhere around $20,000. When the same calculation is used without the 32-day re-anchoring, the result was still a 0.8 R-squared. Y=0.0003x + 0.9695 gies a BTC valuation of $13.500, which according to this year’s all time high, isn’t too far off the mark. Admittedly, there are a few caveats which the analyst sufficiently addresses: Ultimately, what is worth noting is that there is a statistically significant correlation between Bitcoin price and Tether’s market cap. Thus, one can infer that Bitcon’s price could be correcting upwards from its current value of $11,500 given the market cap of Tether and the 1 billion in USDT issuances this year. “An additional $1 billion market cap could potentially move price by around $5K USD,” adds FilbFilb.  But while FilbFilb cautions that he is not comfortable making prediction of a $20,000 Bitcoin price today, he is confident that: “There’s statistical evidence to suggest that there are enough Tethers in issuance to make a directional move towards it, should they get deployed in that way.”As previously reported by Cointelegraph, a series of worsening macro-economic factors are presenting challenges for traditional markets. But these issues also appear to be supporting Bitcoin’s allure as a store-of-value investment and hedge against market volatility within traditional markets. Bitcoin’s growing correlation to Gold, China’s yuan devaluation, Brexit, global monetary easing on part of numerous central banks, and negative bond yields are all driving investors to view Bitcoin as a hedge against volatility.As Cointelegraph reported several weeks ago, Digital asset research firm Delphi Digital found that the current macroeconomic landscape is creating the “perfect storm” to ignite Bitcoin price appreciation.“The relative size of Bitcoin’s market value compared to the investible gold market, for example, makes it a tempting opportunity for investors starving for assets with above-average growth potential as well,” the researchers note. Therefore, it’s no surprise that investors may be increasingly turning to Bitcoin — and Tether as an easy way to access this digital gold — in the coming months as storm clouds continue to gather over the global economy.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

legal and provided guidance on how exactly it should be taxed.","Aug 12, 2019",New Zealand's tax authorities have ruled that income in cryptocurrencies is legal and provided guidance on how exactly it should be taxed.,"In a tax information bulletin published on July 4, the New Zealand Inland Revenue Department summarized the provisions of the public ruling, made under s 91D of the country's Tax Administration Act 1994.Specifically, the guidance on the income tax treatment of crypto assets applies to payments in crypto that form part of the employees’ regular salary and are fixed at a predetermined amount or rate — rather than, for example, payments that form part of an employee share scheme. Moreover, it applies only to salary and wage earners — not to self-employed taxpayers — covering both remuneration for services and bonuses, commissions and gratuities.For a crypto asset-denominated salary to be taxable, the ruling determines that the crypto asset paid to employees must not be subject to a lock-up period and must be directly convertible into fiat currency, clarifying that:“In the current environment where crypto-assets are not readily accepted as payment for goods and services, the Commissioner’s view is that crypto-assets that cannot be converted directly into fiat currency on an exchange [...] are not sufficiently ‘money like’ to be considered salary or wages.”“Money-like” crypto assets are further defined as those that provide a general peer-to-peer payment system, rather than assets that function in a similar way to vouchers, shares or debt securities.Thus for the wage to be taxable, the agency deems that a significant purpose of the crypto asset in question must be that it functions as a currency, or is otherwise to be pegged to one (or more) fiat currencies.As reported, tax authorities and lawmakers globally are increasingly turning their attention to cryptocurrencies — both clarifying which provisions they fall under and attempting to tighten their grip on evasion.Last week, crypto industry sources claimed that the United Kingdom’s tax authority was allegedly requesting that digital currency exchanges provide it with information about customers’ names and transactions aiming to identify cases of tax evasion."

Fernandez stated in an interview with a local TV channel in Buenos Aires on Monday: “Nobody believes Macri can pay back the debt. Bond prices indicate investors see the country in default.”However, Fernande added that he doesn’t want to default on the country’s debt. As investors consider the fallout and potential exacerbation should October’s presidential elections yield repeat results, Bitcoin proponents are eyeing the cryptocurrency’s utility in what is becoming yet another market where its advantages are obvious. As trade volumes on P2P exchange LocalBitcoins showed signs of increasing, Morgan Creek Digital co-founder Anthony Pompliano suggested the peso could form the first in a chain of developing fiat currencies to disintegrate.“Could this be the first of many to be exposed in a currency crisis?” he tweeted Monday. As Cointelegraph reported, Latin America has become an unintended crucible for Bitcoin adoption, with Venezuela’s crisis leading the way. Other economies have felt the knock-on effects, many seeing continued interest in Bitcoin as fiat weakness continues. Earlier this year, investor Tim Draper met with Argentine president, Mauricio Macri, to reportedly bet on the Bitcoin price over the coming years."

She then stated:“Definitely possible could be 20 years from now or it could be tomorrow. Don’t hold your breath. The SEC took a long time to establish Finhub. It might take even longer to approve an exchange traded product.”In June, SEC Chairman Jay Clayton said that the regulator must first feel comfortable with the security of cryptocurrency custodial services before it could move ahead on an ETF.

David Marcus, the man who has come to personify the seismic change ...","Aug 10, 2019","David Marcus, the man spearheading Facebook’s blockchain effort, has gotten a tremendous amount of spotlight lately. The rapid emergence of Libra has dominated the coverage of other crypto-related developments, as it became apparent that the social media giant’s inroad into the realm of digital assets will have most serious consequences for both the blockchain sector and the global financial system in general.","While previously the crypto industry has hardly ever had one key spokesperson — which is perhaps a natural and welcome state of affairs for a domain wherein decentralization is the most cherished of values — Libra’s newfound position at the center of global-level regulatory debate about the future shape of finance propels the project’s charismatic head to serve as the envoy for the whole cryptocurrency space.Like it or not, old-school legislators in the United States and beyond are used to dealing with specific people representing interest groups and industry associations, so Marcus’ two appearances before the U.S. Congress have likely rendered him not just “Mr. Facebook Cryptocurrency,” but simply “Mr. Cryptocurrency” in the eyes of many people in high offices. But how did a Paris-born, Geneva-raised college dropout end up in this capacity of prominence?Born into a Romanian-Iranian family in Paris, the future head of Libra was raised in Switzerland, where he attended the University of Geneva. Like so many of his future tech industry colleagues, he left school long before earning a degree in order to focus on an entrepreneurial career. At aged 23, Marcus founded his first startup — a telecom carrier — which was acquired by a larger integrated communications corporation after four years under his leadership. His first experience with payments came after he established a mobile media monetization company, Echovox, whose feats, among others, included facilitating SMS voting for big-name TV shows.Zong, a spin-off from Echovox, has successfully establishing a payments network that allowed users to make purchases through mobile carrier billing. Putting up such a service on a large scale took Marcus negotiating with hundreds of mobile operators and thousands of merchants. It was Zong’s success that projected Marcus to the position of PayPal’s vice president of mobile upon the payment behemoth’s acquisition of the startup. It came in handy that PayPal had been bracing to ramp up its mobile services, for which task Marcus’ experience proved invaluable. In 2012, he was promoted to be the company’s president, directing the explosive growth of one of the world’s largest payment platforms.In 2014, Mark Zuckerberg seduced Marcus to join Facebook as the head of messaging products. Marcus cited his willingness to go back to managing smaller teams (PayPal counted some 15,000 employees at the end of his term) and to build consumer-facing products and services in a more energetic startup-like environment. Under his leadership, Facebook Messenger substantially grew in terms of the number of active users and saw several improvements in its functionality — including the introduction of tools facilitating the interaction between retailers and their customers, such as chatbots supporting payments.Marcus led Messenger for four years before the entirely new chapter of his career opened with Facebook’s announcement of him taking charge of the newly established exploratory blockchain task force — the initiative now known as Libra.David Marcus is believed to be among the first in the world of big tech to start experimenting with cryptocurrencies, as Asaf Fybish, co-founder of blockchain marketing firm GuerrillaBuzz, told Cointelegraph:“David Marcus is actually considered as one of the first top Silicon Valley executives to adopt and support bitcoin. In 2013, at the LeWeb conference in Paris, Marcus stated the fact that he is a big fan of bitcoin and owns a stash of it. He called bitcoin a store of value and a distributed ledger. Getting this type of support back in 2013 was pretty exciting and we can tell that David has a sense when it comes to blockchain and cryptocurrencies in particular.”“Digital Gold,” a book authored by journalist Nathaniel Popper, mentions Marcus alongside the founders of the Gemini digital currency exchange (i.e., Cameron and Tyler Winkelvoss), co-chairman of Fortress Investment Group Peter Briger, and entrepreneur Wences Casares as high-profile technology executives invested in Bitcoin since at least 2013. Popper claims that Marcus got so fascinated by the original digital asset that he at some point considered quitting PayPal to launch a cryptocurrency exchange.In April 2013, Marcus admitted that PayPal was looking into possible ways to incorporate Bitcoin in the payment company’s operations, saying: “So I’ve been spending a lot of time looking at it, and it’s truly fascinating actually: the way that the currency’s been designed, and the way that inflation is built in to pay for miners, and all that is truly fascinating. I think that for us at PayPal, it’s just a question whether Bitcoin will make its way to PayPal’s funding instrument or not.”Later the same year, speaking at the aforementioned LeWeb conference, Marcus opined that cryptocurrencies had a greater chance of revolutionizing the payments industry within the next 10 years than, say, NFC tap-to-pay technology.Although it initially might have seemed that the move to Facebook had lured Marcus much farther away from his cryptocurrency aspirations than he was at PayPal, destiny took him full circle to end up at the helm of the social platform’s blockchain project just a few years later. Some people in the industry draw direct comparisons between Libra and the payments network Marcus once managed. Ruud Feltkamp, CEO and co-founder of crypto trading platform Cryptohopper, told Cointelegraph:“Here at Cryptohopper, we often asked ourselves: why is nobody creating the ‘PayPal of Crypto’? Great to see it’s actually their former president that is now leading Libra. Regardless of what you think of Facebook, their entrance marks the start of the big companies entering crypto. Next up, Google?”While at PayPal, Marcus remained in a wait-and-see mode, saying in a 2014 interview that it was critical for a payments company present in more than 90 countries to understand the regulatory implications of starting to accept cryptocurrency across all its jurisdictions. At the time, apparently, he couldn’t see a realistic way to make it happen, as PayPal lacked the consumer base and economic power that enabled Facebook to come up with a global cryptocurrency plan five years after.One of Marcus’ main competences is gracefully cutting through the miles of red tape that inevitably accompany scaling a global payment system to millions of dollars worth of transactions per minute: He enthusiastically spoke about that facet of his work as early as in 2012. Even before the Libra appointment, this skill had won him a position on the Coinbase board of directors, as the crypto trading platform was scrambling toward the end of 2017 to handle a surge in both crypto prices and the number of crypto investors.Marcus expressed his enthusiasm for this chance to help Coinbase “democratize access to cryptocurrencies, and deliver on the mission to create an open financial system for the world.” However, his tenure with the exchange only lasted for several months before he had to step down in a move that signaled Facebook’s stepping-up its own blockchain effort.Prior to unveiling Libra, Marcus projected Facebook’s cautious stance on cryptocurrency — for example, citing the functional hurdles in the way of blockchain-enabled payments — saying:“Payments using crypto right now is just very expensive, super slow, so the various communities running the different blockchains and the different assets need to fix all the issues, and then when we get there someday, maybe we’ll do something.”He also sided with Zuckerberg in the wake of the controversial decision to ban all crypto-related ads, supporting the view that most of them were a scam anyway and that the ban has been necessary in order to protect users.Stephanie So, co-founder and chief development officer of blockchain security startup Geeq, observed to Cointelegraph that Marcus is well qualified for his job, but that this should not eliminate concerns over Libra’s governance model:“I would say that David Marcus clearly has spent his career running and understanding the payments industry. If there were to be a play for a group of private corporations to start an alternative global currency to dominate  retail transactions, Marcus' experience in finance at the rate of billions of transactions and dollars, and with world regulators might make sense.”So also agrees with the views that Marcus outlined in his hearing before the U.S. Congress. She said:“I also agree with what he apparently stated in his Congressional testimony: blockchain technology is inevitable. However, as you know, blockchain technology is not well understood. In spite of most blockchains' ideological tendencies toward inclusion and self-governance, there are reasons blockchain has not been widely adopted yet, and that is because there are potentially major gaps in their security models, which means (or should mean) that traditional financial institutions should not be ready to move to blockchain yet.” Unlike many tech executives that hold prominent positions in Silicon Valley for decades without openly expressing their views out in the public, Marcus never shied away it — and in quite a passionate fashion. Hill Ferguson, Marcus’ colleague at Zong and then at PayPal, once testified to the Financial Times that the Libra boss is not missing a human element in him, “He can be a great, persuasive person around a vision but he combines that with being a genuinely solid person — or a ‘mensch’, as he would say — and he really is that in the truest sense of the word.”A notorious, inadvertent expression of how Marcus takes what he does to heart emerged in 2014, when the then-PayPal president lambasted the company’s employees for their reluctance to use PayPal’s own products, calling it “unacceptable” and implying that those who didn’t use the app or forgot the password would be better off to “find something that will connect with your heart and mind elsewhere.”In another instance, Marcus took to social media to express his rather strong opinions amid the 2018 spat between Facebook management and Brian Acton, the co-founder of WhatsApp. Referring to Acton, Marcus wrote that he found “attacking the people and company that made you a billionaire, and went to an unprecedented extent to shield and accommodate you for years, low-class.”Overall, a review of Marcus’ record suggests that, regardless of one’s feelings toward Facebook and Libra, he is fairly well qualified to represent the crypto space before the world’s powerful. While his early involvement with Bitcoin attests to the authenticity of his pro-crypto claims, Marcus’ experience with the global payments market and pro-consumer orientation gives hope that he might at least make an honest attempt to steer Libra in the direction of social good."

The announcement notes that:“This process helps us improve our identity verification efforts and reduce payment risk for BitPay's merchants. It's also a requirement for us to be able to offer verified users future services like Bitcoin payouts, or faster onboarding for people who want to get BitPay prepaid products.”According to BitPay, thresholds for payments and ID requirements have been live as of Aug. 5.While BitPay provides users with a link to its privacy policy, the new measures have been met with some scepticism given the resistance that many in the cryptocurrency community have toward seeing their personal data stored in centralized troves.The developer of open-source BTCPay Server — which was launched as an alternative to BitPay and memorably vowed to make the latter obsolete — tweeted that he was “shocked! SHOCKED!” at the new measures’ introduction, to which one commentator responded:“Imagine being Bitpay. Your investors deserted you, bitcoiners despise you, now bcasher as well while the regulators bully them everyday. I am almost feeling sad for them ... Almost.”Many still remember the 2015 hack of the firm, with losses tallying 5,000 Bitcoin (BTC) worth over $1.8 million at the time.Earlier this month, news surfaced of a possible hack involving the theft of a major swathe of a crypto exchange Binance’s Know Your Customer data (10,000+ personal photos)."

Out of more than 5,000 respondents, only 34% were willing to predict that ETH/BTC would never reach four digits. The optimism may still be misplaced; one year ago, Fundstrat senior analyst Tom Lee made the ill-fated call that ETH/USD would rally to $1,900 by the end of 2018.Developers are continuing to press on with major protocol changes as part of the Ethereum 2.0 project, with co-founder and well-known speaker Vitalik Buterin pledging to take a more hands-off approach in recent months. Earlier this month, however, he implied he had no interest in seeing Ether usurp Bitcoin’s dominance, saying that he would support the coexistence of Bitcoin and Ethereum on a technological level."

individuals “their own bank.” To understand the many services that banks ...","Aug 11, 2019","Bitcoin once promised that it would help realize the lofty goal of making individuals “their own bank.” To understand the many services that banks truly provide is also to realize how preposterous this claim was in 2008, when Bitcoin’s white paper made it. More than a decade later, the grandfather cryptocurrency is still on the peripheries of traditional finance, yet the decentralized industry that it has spawned can indeed replicate many financial services on the blockchain, all of which were formerly exclusively in the realm of banks.","Decentralized finance (DeFi) has quickly become a buzzword. By allowing people to connect to new decentralized lending, exchange, savings and other DeFi platforms, blockchain can provide a cryptocurrency alternative to traditional banking services, and those who are comfortable operating in this ecosystem are therefore able to wield their assets with greater fungibility. Make no mistake: DeFi is not banking, as it only mimics banking functions and is still unable to provide the other thing banks are valued for — i.e., security. Lorenzo Pellegrino, CEO of popular online payments platform Skrill, told Cointelegraph:“Many companies claiming to be banks operate in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, however almost all would find it hard to maintain that title in a regulated space. They use this terminology as it implies a level of safety and regulation found in the wider financial world, something that will most likely be missing from their product.”Accordingly, these applications are not able to accept deposits nor to withdraw to a bank, which is a red flag. They do not defray the liability through legal precedent, and there are no investor-protection schemes covering the tokens if a smart contract goes bust. As mere footnotes to regulations that have yet to fully materialize, “cryptocurrency banks” — in the truest sense — are few and far-between. But they do exist, as blockchain solutions have matured in the hands of teams from both sides of the finance industry and as regulators begin to learn more about the revolution knocking at their door.Crypto banks are banking institutions that engage in the standard range of money-related activities like deposits and withdrawals, savings, lending and borrowing, and investing in a wider range of instruments and markets. While this also describes a standard bank perfectly, crypto banks have integrated cryptocurrency into these financial functions. They’ve also gained legality in the eyes of local financial watchdogs.The challenge facing blockchain is twofold: It must be in a tolerating regulatory environment and have enough local talent to provide mature, trusted solutions. In places with progressive policymakers such as Germany, businesses and institutions holding fiat money and fiat-money-based assets can easily participate in the decentralized economy through a crypto bank. These kinds of crypto banks, such as Bitwala and Spot9, are essentially the skeleton of what will one day be a bridge between the segregated fiat and crypto economies, which is only now beginning to emerge.Regulated by Germany’s Federal Financial Supervisory Authority, Bitwala deposits are insured by the German Deposit Guarantee Scheme up to 100,000 euros (about $113,000), just as they are for other banks regulated in Germany. Its partnership with European Union-regulated SolarisBank ensures that account holders are able to do with Bitwala the same as what they’d do with their regular bank account — i.e., get paid, pay rent and bills, exchange currencies, send interbank payments, and store money in both fiat and cryptocurrencies seamlessly.Due to the unique capabilities of blockchain finance, many of the largest centralized crypto firms are able to offer bank-like services for other enterprise-level businesses, even where regulations haven’t taken shape. In the United States, for example, the Securities and Exchange Commission hasn’t yet indicated that these businesses can integrate with the banking system, and for now, they’re essentially investment funds. Coinbase Custody is one of the most sophisticated examples, but it can only play being a “bank” until regulators give their approval.Serious investors and businesses preferring to operate in full view of tax authorities and regulators will need to do the reporting legwork necessary to legally invest fiat into the tokens available on Coinbase Custody. It allows people with large investments in the crypto market to avail from segregated cold storage while enjoying seamless integration with the Coinbase Pro exchange, insurance for deposits, staking tools where available, customized reporting and third-party auditing.What’s missing from Coinbase’s custody solution? For U.S citizens, Coinbase provides trustworthy storage and exchange, but one cannot pay bills from a Coinbase account nor receive a salary to it. When going to the movies in the U.S., crypto can be used as payment or to repay a friend (who purchased your ticket) by sending money to their bank account. A user would first need to cash out Bitcoin (BTC), for example, and send it from Coinbase to a connected bank, then from the connected bank to the user's own bank. This is because, without regulatory approval, fiat can be turned into crypto (and vice versa), but fiat and crypto do not belong to the same definition of money as it pertains to banks. Clearly there are still obstacles ahead. Skrill’s Pellegrino opined:“While cryptocurrency will definitely play a large role in the future of payment rails, we believe that they will be complementary to the current systems, rather than in full out competition. Established payments companies like ours will be key in helping this adoption.” It becomes more apparent as one realizes that fitting crypto to the current monetary system is the same as trying to put a square peg into a round hole. The most advanced platforms are trying their hardest to render the entrenched competition and regulators obsolete, but they forget that without transferability, one of the five properties of currency is missing from crypto. Tokens have scarcity, durability, divisibility and fungibility down pat, but regulators are able to force a stalemate on transferability. This is why advanced platforms such as MyCryptoBank.io can use fiat-pegged stablecoins for free cross-border transactions, spending and investing — but the second a user decides to hold real USD or equities (and not blockchain derivatives), there is a problem. Regulators can prevent this movement of cryptocurrencies and create roadblocks for individuals to use their own money for their own purposes, or even transfer their funds into fiat currencies.People want to be able to use their money for everything, not 90% of everything. Derivative instruments or precariously stacked debit card solutions built on tenuous partnerships aren’t enough. A recent McKinsey report concurs. Without regulatory approval, all blockchain finance is subject to the underlying fiat market’s three to five day settlement time. According to the report, “If counterparties were to exchange cryptocurrency assets (digital currencies that do not need a central regulating body) rather than fiat currencies, for example, payments could be made and settled in minutes via blockchain, rather than in days as with current systems.”Slow steps toward the universal recognition that cryptocurrency can store and transmit value are being made, but it’s slower where progress counts most. As cryptocurrency finds its legs in the coming years, integrated economies with the most liberal banking authorities will benefit most. With the oldest cryptocurrency still on the fringes of finance, it’s safe to predict that mainstream acceptance is still a ways off."

The exchange will be located in the international financial center and free zone Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM).Commenting on the investment, Basil Al Askari, co-founder of MidChains, told the Gulf News:“We’re an exchange. You can think of it similar to a stock exchange, but where you’re trading equities, for us, it would be crypto. We also perform custody activities, which means we also can store, settle, and clear crypto transactions on behalf of our clients.”According to the company, foreign stakeholders have already expressed interest in using MidChain’s trading platform. Al Askari also said that he sees Bitcoin (BTC) as a new investment class rather than a replacement for existing fiat currencies.Earlier this year, ADGM’s Financial Services Regulatory Authority authorized MidChain to operate a cryptocurrency exchange. This purportedly means that once launched, the platform will be fully regulated by the authority.In June, UAE-based crypto asset exchange and custodian Arabian Bourse (ABX) — a joint venture from GMEX Group and Arshad Khan — received initial regulatory approval from the ADGM. ABX is to be based in the Abu Dhabi Global Market Authorities Building — reportedly in order to benefit from the city’s proactive crypto asset regulatory framework.BitOasis — another UAE-based crypto exchange — secured preliminary approval with financial regulators in April. To get a license, the exchange has to meet specific technical and operational requirements, which it expects to do in the second half of the year."

According to the announcement, the TZROP token allows investors to directly participate in the company’s revenue growth via a quarterly dividend model. The announcement further states that the company could distribute a quarterly dividend of 10% of the company’s adjusted gross revenue for TZROP holders. However, it also specifies that this is subject to approval from the board of directors as well as Delaware law and accounting requirements. The company additionally specifies that it could pay out these dividends in U.S. dollars, Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH) or even with more security tokens.The company’s CEO, Saum Noursalehi, framed this development as a milestone in democratizing the blockchain capital market sector for investors:“Following the one-year anniversary of the close of our security token offering, non-accredited investors now have the ability to purchase and trade in our security tokens. Today marks another milestone as we further democratize access so all investors, regardless of net worth, can invest in the business opportunity of a blockchain-based capital market.”As previously reported by Cointelegraph, tZERO initially offered its secondary trading of security tokens, to accredited investors only, on Jan. 24. At the time, Noursalehi similarly characterized the sale as democratizing access to global markets, commenting:“The world of security tokens has lacked a regulated venue for secondary trading. The trading of our own security tokens is the crossing of the Rubicon for the new world of digital assets. This will create liquidity, democratize access, bring transparency and efficiency to global markets and accelerate the adoption of security tokens.”"

When you look at Litecoin GitHub, it would seem like we did no work in 2019. There are actually 2 reasons why this is the case even though we have been developing.”The first reason Lee provided for the apparent lack of work on Litecoin is that most of the updates applied to Litecoin were originally developed for Bitcoin (BTC) and as such, only the original development dates appear. He explained:“What this means in practice is that although we did work on and release the latest Litecoin Core in May of 2019, if you look at GitHub, most of the commits where [sic] done in 2018. So it would seem like Litecoin developers took the year off.”The second reason provided is that Litecoin developers do not work on the master branch of the project on GitHub. This decision is meant to ensure that building from sources obtained from this branch do not return broken builds. Indeed, leading Litecoin developer Adrian Gallagher has been actively working on the Litecoin Core release 0.18.1 on a personal branch, according to Lee. He also stated:“In the 8 years history of Litecoin, we've only had a handful of core developers working on Litecoin Core.”As Cointelegraph reported yesterday, major cryptocurrency exchange Binance claimed that a dusting attack occurred against Litecoin. Per Binance’s post:“A dusting attack refers to a relatively new kind of malicious activity where hackers and scammers try and break the privacy of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency users by sending tiny amounts of coins to their personal wallets.”At press time, Litecoin is up 5.41% on the day to trade at $87.87, according to data from Coin360."

I know we are original Ethereum project, but maybe this can be water cooler chatter at summit eh?”As Cointelegraph has previously reported, Lohja’s reminder that Ethereum Classic is the original Ethereum project refers to the fact that the coin runs on the original version of the blockchain, before it was hard forked in 2016 in response to the DAO scandal. After the hard fork, “Classic” was added to the cryptocurrency’s name to distinguish it from its successor, Ether (ETH).With Ether currently ranked largest altcoin by market cap, Ethereum Classic lags some way behind in its 21st spot ranking.Lohja’s suggestion that the coin should dissociate itself completely from the Ethereum project in terms of its branding in order to see market cap gains was met by support by Yaz Khoury, director of the Ethereum Classic non-profit ETC Cooperative, who responded:“I always advocated changing the currency names. The network name can change organically if we start calling the currency itself something else.”The ETC Classic Summit — to be held in Vancouver, Canada — is planned for October 3-4.Within an emerging sector, the question of names is a matter of heated deliberation as different currencies, assets and tokens attempt to differentiate themselves and vie for adoption.Even a symbol is perceived to have a significance for a cryptocurrency’s useability: this August, some industry commentators argued that Bitcoin (BTC)’s potential for everyday retail payments would be better served if there were a consensus to formalize the symbol used to denote its smallest unit, the Satoshi — or one hundred millionth of one Bitcoin.This May, one study appeared to indicate that the readability of a cryptocurrency’s three-letter long ticker symbol positively correlates with higher returns.Notoriously, there has also been talk of companies allegedly attempting to cash in on the hype by including “Blockchain” or “Bitcoin” in their names. With industry classifications still evolving, names for asset types can themselves vary either according to geographical jurisdiction or to their functionality."

around 7,000 Bitcoin (worth around $40 million at the time of the hack) ...","Aug 10, 2019","On Aug. 7, Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange (by daily trade volume), fell victim to a hacking scandal that saw the miscreant allegedly gain possession of a huge chunk of the firm’s Know Your Customer (KYC) data (10,000+ personal photos). The hacker is reportedly demanding a total of 300 Bitcoins (worth around $3.5 million) from the exchange, or else he or she will release all of the data.","Also, it bears mentioning that upon commencing his activities, the hacker set up a couple of dedicated Telegram groups (which have since been shut down) that allegedly featured a lot of the sensitive material. However, since all of this data lacked a digital watermark that Binance typically uses for its internal information, there are doubts regarding the authenticity of this material. On the subject, Binance’s security team had the following comment:“At the present time, no evidence has been supplied that indicates any KYC images have been obtained from Binance, as these images do not contain the digital watermark imprinted by our system.”Binance claims that the images released thus far can be dated back to February, a time when the premier trading platform was making use of a third-party service provider to process its KYC verifications. Similarly, the exchange reportedly also asked the hacker to provide them with more information regarding the source of this KYC data, but the individual simply demanded 300 BTC and refused to give the team any irrefutable evidence.At this point, some are questioning if Binance may be trying to absolve itself of any wrongdoing in the matter by somewhat deflecting the blame toward the third-party vendor managing the company’s KYC info at the time. Cointelegraph spoke to independent crypto author and analyst Sam Town, who pointed out:“KYC data should be — and is — currently handled in-house by major exchanges. We may be more than a decade post-Satoshi, but the cryptocurrency ecosystem is still a work in progress. Stop-gap solutions like third party KYC data management may be necessary to bootstrap a platform, but that doesn't absolve Binance of responsibility in this case.”A similar sentiment is also shared by Paul Bischoff, editor at Comparitech, who agrees that even companies and governments are routinely blamed for errors made by their contractors and affiliates, and Binance therefore bears a huge chunk of the responsibility in relation to this entire episode — if the data turns out to be genuine.As part of the firm’s damage-control measures, Binance’s security team is offering a reward of 25 Bitcoins to any person who can supply them with pertinent information that can help in the arrest of the hacker/hackers behind this incident. And while all of this may sound fine, it is hard to avoid the fact that the leading crypto exchange also fell victim to another hacking scandal this past May, which saw the company lose around 7,000 Bitcoin (worth around $40 million at the time of the hack). At the time, many people predicted that the incident would have an irreparable impact on the company’s image. However, Binance’s performance has only continued to improve ever since. Source: Coin360.comIn this regard, following this latest data breach, the price of Binance Coin (BNB) — the premier crypto exchange’s native digital currency — has soared by over 12%, thereby indicating that the global crypto community doesn't seem to care all that much about this possible security mishap. On the subject, Town bluntly notes:“Over 500,000 Facebook users had their private data — including ID details and location data — leaked in April this year. The Cambridge Analytica saw the private data of 87 million Facebook users exploited in early 2018. Did anybody really care? Did anybody stop using Facebook? Bithumb lost $30 million in a hack in June — it still turns over $700 million in daily volume and ranks in the top 30 exchanges. Nobody cares enough about data privacy for the Binance KYC ‘hack’ to matter.”It is also worth mentioning that soon after the incident came to light, the CEO of Binance,  Changpeng Zhao (aka CZ), took to Twitter to tell his followers that they should not fall into the “KYC leak” FUD. However, this remark does not seem to address the heart of the issue: If it’s true that sensitive KYC data was leaked online, it puts a lot of people’s privacy and digital security at risk. If the stolen data turns out to be real, the 10K+ leaked images in question could be worth a lot of money to various criminals. Bischoff points out that they could potentially be used by miscreants to bypass two-factor authentication measures, or even facilitate a variety of bank drop scams. In a recent article, Bischoff wrote at length about how passport images and scans are regularly used by nefarious, third-party agents to carry out their illegal activities. Not only that, leaked KYC data is often used to create fake IDs and passports, which can be sold for as much as $1,500. Lastly, according to various unconfirmed reports, it does not seem as though the actions of the hacker(s) are an attempt to spread any FUD regarding Binance, but rather he/she seems to be motivated by the Bitcoin ransom alone. Cointelegraph reached out to Binance for comment, but the exchange representative said that no further information is available.All of the information that Binance and various credible media sources have provided has already been discussed at this point. However, if certain theories are to be believed, a hacker by the name of Bnatov Platon could be behind this entire ordeal. It is alleged that Platon offered to assist Binance when the exchange was hacked back in May. He was apparently able to track the people who stole the 7,000 BTC from the premier trading platform as well recover over 60,000 KYC files associated with the company’s customer base.Related: Funds Are SAFU, but Reorg Is Not: What We Know About the Binance Hack So FarPlaton claims that the hacker(s) could gain access to all of this information by infiltrating the account of a company insider who allegedly installed a back door into Binance’s trading module (via API keys) — thereby allowing the hacker(s) to make off with the aforementioned sum of crypto.However, this is where matters get interesting. Platon — who refers to himself as a “white hacker” — allegedly demanded a reward of 300 Bitcoins from Binance in return for providing the company with details of the intruders, including their names, phone numbers, photos, server data and correspondence. But when representatives working for the exchange did not grant his request for a reward, he released the KYC details of more than 600 Binance customers via different Telegram groups. In relation to the matter, Platon reportedly added:“When I require money, I can just hack out one exchange account balance (hacker’s). I could retrieve more than 600 or 700 coins easily by hacking the hacker’s wallet. [...] My decision for negotiation with Binance was wrong. They are not the right people… so I will just publish all of the data.”Lastly, Platon also claims to have tracked the bulk of the laundered Bitcoins that were stolen from the exchange back in May. According to him, at least 2,000 of these coins were sent to various wallet addresses via different exchanges, including Bitmex, Yobit, KuCoin and Huobi. He now claims to have plans of publishing all of the data he has under his control across various public domains.In relation to the matter, we reached out to Benjamin Pirus, the host of a podcast called “Crypto: Secrets of the Trade.” He believes that the narrative including Platon is quite compelling and is definitely worth investigating further. When asked about what the best way for CZ to tackle this situation would be, Pirus responded by saying:“I think it really depends on how Binance deals with the situation in the coming days. CZ has done a decent job over the past two years in handling difficulties, especially considering the exchange’s rapid growth. I hope the authorities will be able to work with Binance to solve the issue, in line with proper laws and regulations.”"

Telegram has the entire crypto community that lives and breathes ...","Aug 10, 2019","Last month, Facebook rocked the world with its blockbuster Libra announcement. Even a year ago, the idea that an iconic United States company would launch a digital currency or that a sitting president would tweet about it seemed insane. ","Welcome to the new normal.The Libra announcement sent politicians scrambling, hit the mainstream media like a hurricane, and left many crypto influencers wondering if the social network giant just turned 90% of altcoins worthless. What tiny crypto project with a few dozen programmers can stand against the combined might of not just Facebook but also the titans of the tech and payment processing world, such as Uber, Lyft, Paypal, Visa and Mastercard?But there’s a new hope on the horizon. One company on the planet has the power to take on the social media monster and win: Telegram.   While Facebook has 1.8 billion users, Telegram raised $1.7 billion.While Facebook has the unwashed masses who’ve never held a Bitcoin, Telegram has the entire crypto community that lives and breathes altcoins for breakfast.While Mark Zuckerberg is the poster child for the internet as a surveillance economy, Pavel Durov, the founder of Telegram, is a fight-the-power renegade, with digital privacy being a focus throughout his career.While Zuckerburg looks like someone doing a bad impression of Data from Star Trek, Durov looks like he just stepped off the stage of Magic Mike.If you’re a pioneering member of the crypto community, you might have looked with scorn on the Telegram fundraiser, which beat the initial coin offering regulatory backlash by raising all of its money from private accredited investors, rather than crowdsourcing it from the people. Maybe you only read the short Telegram white paper that looks and reads more like slick marketing than a detailed deep dive?You should take a closer look.The more you look, the more you realize there’s a lot to root for if you’re longing for a legitimate top contender to take on Libra — i.e., the nightmare of cyberpunks.  Start with Pavel Durov.  The man built two successful companies, including VKontakte (aka VK), a Facebook-equivalent that is especially popular in Russia, and he followed that up with Telegram. That means he knows how to build real, working, scalable platforms when most crypto projects can’t even get their testnets off the ground. He’s also an antihero and iconoclast with a philosophy of radical individualism and self-sovereignty that matches the cypherpunk ethos that launched Bitcoin and a thousand other crypto ships. Even better, he backs that philosophy up with action.  Currently, Facebook faces a $5 billion fine from the Federal Trade Commission for protecting users’ data the way the mob “protects” small businesses. Durov, on the other hand, refused to create a backdoor to Telegram when the Russian Supreme Court demanded it — and even as American companies like Apple, which normally stand tough on privacy, caved and yanked Telegram from the app store. While Zuckerberg built his company on surveillance as a business model, Durov built his company on privacy. If you only skimmed the brief white paper for TON, you might have missed that Durov isn’t alone. He's backed by a bevy of math geniuses and hardcore programmers, who started coding in diapers and won strings of gold medals at the International Math Olympiad while you were watching Saturday morning cartoons. One of those folks is Pavel's brother Nikolai Durov, chief technology officer of Telegram, who solved cubic equations at the age of eight, started coding at nine and wrote his first operating system at 13 — in assembly language.  Nikolai Durov also wrote the much longer and more comprehensive technical white paper, which weighs in at a whopping 132 pages. It’s a dense, complex and ambitious outline for the new Telegram Open Network (TON) platform. However, some have bashed it as a fantasy for promising a sci-fi utopia that solves every single problem in crypto. It’s not the first time Telegram faced criticism for its architectural choices, with Gizmodo’s William Turton once writing an article with the headline “Why You Should Stop Using Telegram Right Now.” The article hits Telegram hard for choosing client-server encryption instead of end-to-end encryption by default. Even though Telegram defends its choice of architecture, as it gives people the best of both worlds with the choice of secret chats, the criticism continues to dog the company to this day.Some redditors even panned the white paper as nothing but a bunch of buzzwords and hand-waving.But read through it closely and you’ll realize that, if Telegram pulls off even a quarter of what is  proposed, it could prove revolutionary.  If it works, TON will solve the issues surrounding scaling, storage and decentralized identity as well as protect the platform against constant assault from hostile powers. Yes, the paper is a grab bag of ideas — some of them unique and some taking inspiration from a wide spectrum of sources — but building on other people’s good ideas isn’t a bad thing, it’s a virtue.  It’s only a problem for people suffering from not-invented-here syndrome, a debilitating mental disease that makes people think they have all the answers and that nobody else has any idea worth doing.  While Libra’s white paper frequently drops the term Blockchain — a total of 40 times in the 26-page text — apparently in an attempt to stretch its meaning far enough so that a “cryptographically authenticated database"" can also be called one,  the TON team knows the difference between a blockchain and a hole in the wall. It is looking to deliver a massively sharded and scalable system that sends and receives not only money, but encrypted messages and a killer sticker collection that makes the emojis from WhatsApp’s messenger look like ASCII art. It wants to do all that while enabling robust peer-to-peer encrypted storage for your important documents and even allows for decentralized virtual private networks. While Facebook soaks up the punishment and pressure from hysterical governments and politicians who say with a straight face that they’re worried that Libra’s wallet — which is compliant with Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering laws — can be used for “terrorism,"" Telegram’s team wisely stays out of the spotlight, just like Satoshi Nakamoto did with Bitcoin. If you want to build a platform in peace, it is better to do your work in private and not draw the attention of publicity-seeking politicians trying to get reelected in battleground states.Governments love cutting off the head of the snake. If you don’t give them a head to cut off, then they don’t know where to strike.But even with all that going for them, does Telegram have the power to build a true platform for e-commerce and the decentralized applications of tomorrow? Can it stand against the titanic forces behind Facebook's nascent digital currency and the masters of the e-commerce universe backing it? That is the trillion dollar question, as the platforms that win the day might end up controlling a massive chunk of the world economy and could make or break nations, companies and people. With so much at stake, it’s going to be a war.To win, it will take a hero.  The might of the world’s old-guard is nearly absolute. Nation states print money, and printing money is the power of God.  To break the stranglehold, you need to build a perfect platform: one that’s easy to use, scales massively and is impossible to bring down — a Hydra with a thousand regenerating heads. It must have all the features of the old financial system and new ones that nobody can resist. It’s got to bring in people and businesses with ease so that it grows too big to fail.  The age of surveillance capitalism is upon us, and it’s growing stronger every day. It’s a dragon that’s eaten the world.Facebook is the dragon’s head.  If there’s anything that can bring that dragon crashing from the skies, the early odds go to Telegram. While Libra can and will leverage Facebook’s 1.7 billion users to rapidly accelerate adoption, Telegram’s user base of over 200 million people is a growing force in its own right.And even with fewer users, Telegram has one major advantage: Most Facebook users wouldn’t know a Bitcoin from a casino chip. On the other hand, Telegram is well known for its vibrant, technically savvy community — including most of the world’s crypto-faithful, who host their user groups and do their day-to-day business there.  That means if TON drops a bunch of coins in its Telegram-attached wallet, a bigger percentage of those users will probably know how to spend, save and send that money, while Facebook’s users might start ringing the support lines, wondering how to reset the password on their private key.That’s not to say Telegram’s team is perfect by any means. It has faced intense criticism for a hand-waving white paper that promises much without telling people exactly how it will work. Beyond that, there has mostly been radio silence from the team since its mega ICO. There is a private beta, but it’s closed to the wider public for now. In the end, the project might prove too ambitious even for a talented team with a lot of capital on hand.  The company is also running out of time to deliver. If its team is going to succeed, it needs to step up now. The stakes have never been higher. People willingly sacrifice privacy for convenience without a second thought. The original crypto dream of self-sovereignty is slowing warping into a terrifying Black Mirror episode, in which blockchains don’t enable privacy but rather ubiquitous surveillance on an unprecedented scale. Blockchain analytic tools peer deeply into transactions, and the SEC is looking for teams and tools dedicated to blockchain analysis. Facebook will happily give third parties that convenience and a two-way mirror into all of our lives.Telegram might not be the hero we expected — or even the one we wanted — but it may be our last, best hope for a future that doesn’t turn into a dystopian nightmare of panopticoins.  The crypto revolution started idealistically with a twinkle in Satoshi’s eye. There’s always a certain naivety in revolutions. You have to be crazy to take on entrenched adversaries. The kings of the world have the money, the guns and the legal hammers, and they’re willing to use them at all costs to keep a firm grip on the royal scepter.But some revolutions find a way..Daniel Jeffries is an author, futurist and thinker.

However, releasing such a service also comes with potential issues related to distribution control as well as cybersecurity.The report cites a survey conducted by the Electric Power Research Institute, which lends some insight and credence to these claims. In the survey, 77% of respondents apparently said that the energy sector lacks appropriate standards for implementing blockchain solutions. Nonetheless, utilities in the United States are said to be conducting research or pilot stages for blockchain programs, while some European utilities have been using blockchain tech for over one year.Problems for the U.S. arise in particular, since state and federal bodies have different responsibilities with respect to energy laws. The report notes that states usually have jurisdiction over retail electricity transactions, while the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission presides over wholesale electricity transactions and transmissions for interstate commerce. Thus, it’s critical for the sector to have regulatory clarity on whether distributed energy transactions would be counted as resale or wholesale enterprises, as per the report. As previously reported by Cointelegraph, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has recently awarded a grant in the amount of $1.05 million to four organizations working to create a commercial, blockchain-based energy transaction platform. The four companies are ComEd, the University of Denver, Virginia Tech and BEM Controls. Dr. Amin Khodaei at the University of Denver commented: “The growing proliferation of distributed energy resources calls for advanced management frameworks that support peer-to-peer communications while being fast, scalable and secure [...] Now is the time to develop and demonstrate the technologies that can make a more sustainable and resilient future possible.”"

Hoskinson also asked users to send screenshots and comments on the latest version of Daedalus, which is an open source cryptocurrency wallet also backed by IOHK.As per IOHK’s website, Cardano is a blockchain platform that uses the proof of stake algorithm Ouroboros. Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, is based on the functional programming language Haskell. Daedalus, for its part, is the only cryptocurrency wallet that supports ADA. Additionally, the website states that Daedalus can also be used as a wallet manager to organize and provide backup for other wallets and their assets.As previously reported by Cointelegraph, Hoskinson announced during the blockchain conference Consensus 2019 that he would be working on a new project with the security token platform Polymath. The project is called Polymesh, and is reportedly an attempt to create a blockchain for tokens centered on meeting regulatory requirements. In the announcement, Hoskinson said:“After co-founding Ethereum and Cardano, two of the most widely used blockchains in the world, I am looking forward to working on Polymesh. There are quadrillions of dollars of financial securities, and building a blockchain to secure them is an incredibly exciting task.”Hoskinson has also commented in the past on how he believes Libra is not going to succeed in its global aims, particularly within emerging markets. In an interview late June, he commented:“Facebook has to come into countries it doesn’t know a lot about and convince them to enslave themselves to an economic monopoly and give nothing in return. And their only pitch is that you’ll pay less on fees. [...] I’m going there and saying, ‘we’re going to rebuild all your systems so you have fraud-free land registration, better voting systems and improved supply chains.’ We’re already doing this stuff but it took years. These are relationship-based markets – and Facebook doesn’t have those relationships.”"

This update includes a multitude of features that make ABBC a “world class transactional blockchain overnight” according to their CEO, Mr. Jason Daniel Paul Philip.Aside from the Buyaladdin platform which is slated to launch in October, Mr. Philip shared something that ABBC supporters can get excited about — a whole new blockchain ecosystem and wallet overhaul.Additionally, the ABBC Team will be releasing an updated ABBC whitepaper soon, but prior to that, the team announced a few sneak peeks for their users. With the new mainnet now in place, ABBC customers will experience transactions speeds that are an order of magnitude faster than the previous mainnet, a hassle-free migration between the old and new ABBC blockchain, as well as benefit from a globally distributed, highly availability and responsive enterprise-grade network, just to name a few.The new ABBC mobile wallet has been completely re-designed by DeepDive.tech from the ground up and offers many new capabilities which have been developed with the “everyday” end-user in mind. With the newly designed ABBC wallet, users will now be able to easily transact with not just their ABBC coins, but with a significant amount of existing tokens, all while using the ABBC wallet on any of the supported major operating system platforms (Android, iOS and desktop). The new ABBC wallet also offers full support for other major cryptocurrencies, and currently supports all ERC-20 tokens (1,600 tokens to be exact), with additional token types to be supported in the near future. Simply put, the ABBC wallet platform enables users to transact across multiple wallet addresses supporting multiple accounts and cryptocurrencies, all from the end user computing platform of your choice.With upgrades come the topic of migration, and typically migrating is a big hassle for users, but not with this update. According to the DeepDive.tech, the development partner of ABBC, the upgraded wallet only requires users to click twice to migrate from the former ABBC MC Wallet or Aladdin Wallet to the new Gen 2 ABBC wallet and blockchain. The wallet migration process is so simple and straightforward that users simply need to enter the email address that was used when configuring their previous wallet, and then click on a one-time use link which will confirm ownership of their email address. From there, the wallet and funds migration process will happen instantly.In addition to the deployment of the new ABBC mainnet and wallet, the ABBC blockchain has updated their consensus algorithm from a hybrid combination of Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) to Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) which delivers enhanced network security, integrity, scalability, and speed.According to the ABBC Development Team, the new ABBC mainnet already supports 5,000 transactions per second, making the blockchain arguably one of the top performers in the industry today. Tad Einstein, CTO of development partner DeepDive.tech, mentioned that “5,000 transactions per second is just the start and you can expect to see these numbers increase significantly over time. What makes ABBC’s next-gen blockchain ecosystem unique is that we have implemented several disruptive blockchain technologies within the mainnet which will ensure the project’s current and future performance requirements are met.” Boris Heismann, CIO of DeepDive.tech, also stated that “The new ABBC ecosystem has been created with special features which make it the most efficient blockchain for broad FinTech adoption. Implementing these design considerations were instrumental when you consider Buyaladdin’s global 100-million customer user base.” Another item that came up in conversation was that each block is being generated every half a second, providing a seamless user experience when transacting.The mainnet has been architected to be highly available and globally distributed to ensure a predictable quality of experience for end-users. The global infrastructure supporting the mainnet leverages a hybrid deployment model, with ABBC nodes being strategically distributed across Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and privately-owned data centers. This deployment model affords the ABBC blockchain with enterprise grade reliability and resiliency while delivering a low latency transactional experience for consumers."

#United Kingdom · #Brexit. Related News.","Aug 11, 2019","Back in 2016, there was a referendum that caused Brexit, which has since been affecting all spheres of British life. Would Brexit’s effects be positive or negative for the fintech industry in the United Kingdom? We asked experts from the London Fintech Week, the U.K. in a Changing Europe, the University of Nottingham and more. Meanwhile — and this should be underlined — a lot of experts declined to give comments on such a politically sensitive topic.","While the U.K.’s government was trying to deal with Brexit, with numerous negotiations taking place during 2018, the European Union has made a turn to the blockchain industry, coming up with several major initiatives. Although the U.K. gained its position back in 2014 “as the world’s leading global financial services centre,” with an ambition to become a world leader in developing fintech as well as a global hub for financial innovation, Brexit leaves a major concern within the crypto industry: How might the U.K. deal with crypto after Brexit?Related: Blockchain and Brexit: How Adoption Could Help With UK–EU RelationsHowever, some research has shown the negative effects that Brexit raised among financial services organizations within the U.K. For example, a report from TheCityUK underlines a significant decrease in the required tech talents in the fintech sector and a report from NewFinancial stresses that fintech businesses are moving from the U.K. to the E.U. in preparation for Brexit. At the same time, one of the Big Four auditors, KPMG, shows “a significant portion of the 55% increase in funding of UK fintechs since 2015.”There is no consensus among experts that companies currently settled in Britain will leave the county due to Brexit, as some of them believe separating from the EU will actually attract more fintech businesses to the U.K. “Just as the U.K. is the financial capital of the world, London is the fintech capital of Europe, only lagging behind China and the U.S. in terms of global placement. The strength of the U.K.’s position is built on three key factors: U.K. financial services, the nature of U.K. customers and the U.K. regulatory environment.  “Investors put more money into U.K. fintech than any other European country in 2018. Fintech thrives in London, for the financial sector is uniquely located alongside a booming technology sector — something uncharacteristic of Silicon Valley, Route 128 or Wall Street. This provides an overlap of local financial and tech savvy talent. It also houses attractive investment incentives such as the Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme, which provides initial income tax relief of 50% on start-up investments up to 100,000 pounds [about $120,000]. “In combination with a diverse talent pool, active government support for foreign investment, and regulators progressively levelling the playing field between fintech entrants and incumbent institutions. The U.K. is a global fintech leader and will remain so, Brexit notwithstanding.”— Jane Thomason, CEO of Fintech Worldwide, industry associate of the UCL Centre for Blockchain Technologies  “It is hard to predict the precise direction fintech businesses in the U.K. will take after Brexit. Like all parts of the financial services sector, the outcome will depend on the type of Brexit the U.K. sees. However, the impact on fintech is especially hard to predict because its success depends on a number of policy areas, each of which will see different Brexit impacts.“For example, the U.K. has stimulated the fintech sector through a regulatory regime that facilitates innovation and this could see an acceleration after Brexit if the U.K. does not seek convergence with the EU regulatory landscape.“On the other hand, attracting the international ‘tech talent’ that has been vital to London’s fintech success could be harder after Brexit. This depends on the immigration rules that are put in place by the U.K. after Brexit.“If fintech businesses in the U.K. can’t access international individuals working in areas such as machine learning, artificial intelligence and blockchain as easily after Brexit, this could cause a contraction in the sector because currently, up to a fifth of the skills used by the fintech sector in the U.K. have come from the EU. It will take time to develop the domestic skills pipelines to replace these individuals post-Brexit and some firms may leave the U.K. for the EU rather than wait.”— Sarah Hall, senior fellow at The UK in a Changing Europe, professor of economic geography in the Faculty of Social Sciences, University of Nottingham “The U.K. looks set to leave the EU without a deal, with the ensuing uncertainty and hit to the economy threatening to make it a less attractive place to do business for many companies.  Leaving the single market without a trade deal will also severely affect the U.K.’s position as a gateway to Europe, with cities such as Paris making plans to usurp this role from London once it loses preferential access to European markets.   “Given the importance of financial services to the U.K. economy and the effort the country has already put into encouraging fintech start-up and retention, the U.K.’s new government will likely want to do whatever it can to ensure this continues. This will be crucial for the economy after Brexit, and also for the survival of both the government and the Conservative Party.   “In the short term, established companies may try to weather the storm and we may see a slowdown in investment or start-ups until the future becomes a little clearer. In the long-run, the U.K. is likely to go to great lengths to encourage such companies to come to the U.K. and stay.  It will need to if it wants to survive the economic fallout of Brexit.”— Chris Stafford, doctoral researcher in the School of Politics and International Relations, University of Nottingham “If we take No-Deal Brexit as the most likely outcome, we can expect a significant downturn for the U.K. fintech market. For one, U.K. firms may lose access to EU financial markets if the U.K. chooses to deregulate its financial rules, because the EU may no longer deem them to be equivalent. Even if this would not happen immediately, the mere possibility will be enough to spook many investors. Additionally, should the pound crash as a result of No-Deal Brexit, we can expect many financial actors (i.e., U.K. fintech's clientele) to simply leave the U.K. (as has already been taking place). The financial institutions that do stay behind (like banks) would be under too much strain to meaningfully spend on fintech innovation. “All this, mixed with weaker recruitment opportunities, less access to funding and technology (because of new import barriers), means that the U.K.'s status as an attractive destination for fintech startups will be severely harmed.  “The loss of access to EU financial markets could not be compensated by a trade deal with the U.S. (or any other nation for that matter), especially because there is no reason why the U.S. would agree to deregulate its own financial market to facilitate the access of U.K. firms. Because of the economic downturn caused by No-Deal Brexit, the U.K. would not have any leverage to ask for any preferential treatment: A trade deal with the U.S. would therefore be on U.S. terms. “The best thing that could happen for the U.K. fintech industry (other than the cancellation of Brexit), would be for Brexit to take place under the Withdrawal Agreement. In short, this would increase the likelihood for the status quo for the U.K. financial industry to be conserved, even if the inevitable harm to the U.K. economy caused by Brexit does cause some disruptions.”— Nick Botton, consultant at Landmark Public Affairs “We have seen that despite the chaos surrounding Brexit, British fintechs are doing better than ever. There are three major factors in this success: the access to highly-qualified international talent, the presence of financial institutions and the connections with overseas funds. If the divorce were to affect any of these, there’s a significant chance the U.K. would lose its lead in the fintech scene. I also believe that hard or No-Deal Brexit will have negative effects on the fintech scene and the overall startup ecosystem.“Having rated over 2,600 early stage startups, we know the quality of the team has the biggest impact on growth potential. So if Brexit were to diminish the talent pool, it could definitely stunt the development of budding fintechs and therefore reduce their attractiveness to investors. Also, if Brexit were to push corporations to relocate (as JPMorgan and others have already done) we expect several fintechs will follow — especially B2B [i.e., business-to-business] and B2B2C [i.e., business-to-business-to-customer] startups that distribute their products through corporations. “Nevertheless, the U.K. remains the most welcoming country for fintechs in terms of regulatory framework, so regardless of how Brexit unfolds, it will maintain a certain competitive edge over its EU neighbors. But for how long?”— Antoine Baschiera, co-founder and CEO of Early Metrics These quotes have been edited and condensed."

striving for mainstream adoption but take hours to confirm transactions.","Aug 13, 2019",A decentralized public network that aims to ensure the internet belongs to its users is taking Facebook to task — and alleges “it’s been their internet for too long” in reference to the social media giant.,"Hedera, “the only public decentralized network that utilizes the hashgraph consensus algorithm,” has recently paid for a full-page ad in the weekend edition of the Wall Street Journal that said: “Thank you Facebook Libra. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.”Mance Harmon, the company’s CEO and co-founder, said he shared his vision for Hedera with Facebook’s David Marcus in February 2018 — setting out the startup’s technology roadmap and model to deliver stable, decentralized governance.Hedera’s governing council consists of 39 prominent organizations across 18 unique industries and 11 global regions; it thus far includes names like IBM, Tata Communications, Deutsche Telekom, Swisscom Blockchain, DLA Piper, Nomura and Magazine Luiza. Members of the governing body have no rights to profit from the network, and their tenure is term-limited — a distinction it says Facebook missed when it unveiled the Libra Association. The team notes it has released its governing body LLC agreement in full along with all council meeting minutes.According to the company, it also offers an advantage over Libra and existing public decentralized networks through its Consensus Service, recently announced in partnership with Hyperledger Fabric. The service allows any private application or distributed ledger to send “high-throughput transactions through its public network for decentralized trust.” The team says it expects 10,000 cryptocurrency transactions per second, with a goal to achieve 100,000 over time. Hedera adds that stability is achieved through technical, legal and governance controls designed to deliver a network that doesn’t fork. With over 2,000 developers actively building on Hedera’s testnet, and Open Access (the first time everyone is able to use the mainnet) approaching by the end of this summer, it’s “looking forward to quickly getting this service into the hands of builders,” the company notes.In a letter last month, Harmon said Facebook’s imitation has validated Hedera’s contrarian approach, writing: “While we welcome Libra to the market we helped pioneer, we believe our governance model, security and performance are superior to it. We want the world to know there is a faster, fairer, more secure alternative out there.”Hedera says its consensus service has a multitude of potential use cases — including for financial marketplaces and matching engines, not too dissimilar from those relied on by the likes of Airbnb and Uber. The team describes it as “the first public distributed ledger technology (DLT) to offer consensus-as-a-service for transactions, with fair ordering, incredibly high-throughput, and privacy (encryption) for all transactions.”The company argues that the market is ready for this type of service, which is also interoperable with existing public and private systems — offering an antidote to “slow and expensive” public ledgers like Bitcoin and Ethereum, which are striving for mainstream adoption but take hours to confirm transactions.Hedera says it is initially offering three services that make decentralization easily accessible to application developers: Cryptocurrency, Smart Contract, and File Services, with its Consensus Service available soon after open access. The company emphasizes that its native cryptocurrency, HBAR, will enable value to be transferred between accounts “quickly, inexpensively and without an intermediary.” At the same time, Hedera’s Smart Contracts service, which uses the Solidity programming language, paves the way for code to be executed deterministically without the need to trust a centralized application operator. Hashes of data can be stored and validated across the network via its File Service — enabling users to create decentralized and revocable registries and records.The company’s vision is to create a public, decentralized network in which everyone can participate — ensuring no single entity can have undue influence technologically or through decision making processes. The team says its governing council will always work in the best interests of the network. Members of its council have a three-year maximum term, can sit for up to two consecutive terms, and will be involved in voting on decisions concerning Hedera’s network and platform. Swirlds, which created the hashgraph algorithm, the beating heart of the ecosystem, has a permanent seat.Disclaimer. Cointelegraph does not endorse any content or product on this page.
