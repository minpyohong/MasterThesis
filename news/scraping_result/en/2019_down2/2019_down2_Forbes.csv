rely on blockchain technology, as bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies ...","Aug 13, 2019,02:58am EDT","Bitcoin's release a little over ten yeas ago was a relatively small event that's had huge ramifications, with some of the world's biggest companies and countries getting into cryptocurrencies. ","The bitcoin price has soared over the last decade, climbing to highs of almost $20,000 per bitcoin in late 2017 before falling back sharply—but not before its massive bull run had caught the attention of many banks, retailers and tech companies. Now, a senior official at China's central bank has said it's ""almost ready"" to issue its own sovereign digital currency, potentially bringing the idea of bitcoin, crypto, and digital currencies to China's billions of people. Yi Gang is the governor of the People's Bank of China (PBOC), which has said it's gearing up to ... [+] release its own digital currency which could rival bitcoin and Facebook's libra. The bank's potential bitcoin rival is ""close to being out,"" Mu Changchun, deputy director of the People's Bank of China (PBOC) payments department, said at an event held by China Finance 40 Forum over the weekend but stopped short of giving an exact launch date, it was first reported by Bloomberg, a financial newswire. However, Mu Changchun also said China's digital currency would not solely rely on blockchain technology, as bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies do, due to fears it wouldn't be able to handle China's vast transaction volumes.China's PBOC has been looking into creating a bitcoin rival for the last five years, with other major central banks, including Sweden’s Riksbank, also seriously considering releasing a digital currency to begin replacing physical cash.Mu Changchun added China's digital currency will be issued by both the central bank and financial institutions. Last month, the state-owned Bank of China, the world's fourth-biggest bank by assets, posted a pro-bitcoin infographic on its website, explaining the history of bitcoin and how cryptocurrencies work—shortly after bitcoin was legally recognized by a Chinese court, finding the cryptocurrency should be considered digital property.""The Bank of China posted up an article about bitcoin,"" Samson Mow, chief strategy officer of bitcoin and blockchain technology company Blockstream, said via Twitter, alongside a screenshot of the infographic. ""They explained how [bitcoin] works, why the price is going up, and why it’s valuable. Never thought I’d see that happen,"" he added, describing it as ""bullish.""The bitcoin price has risen strongly so far in 2019 as bitcoin and cryptocurrency rumours swirled around some of the world's biggest technology companies.Social media giant Facebook, micro-blogging platform Twitter, and iPhone-maker Apple have all been looking into crypto and bitcoin, with Facebook planning to release its own digital currency, libra, some time next year if it can get the world's financial regualtors onboard. The release of China's own cryptocurrency could give the same boost to bitcoin and cryptocurrency prices that Facebook's libra plans have done. Meanwhile, U.S. retail giant Walmart is also reportedly looking to develop its own cryptocurrency, with some speculating that the one-time world's largest retailer could be looking to compete with Facebook's beleaguered libra project—something that many believe to be behind bitcoin's rally so far this year.The bitcoin price climbed rapidly in late 2017 before crashing to under $4,000 per bitcoin but has ... [+] since somewhat rebounded. ""It is without doubt that with the announcement of [Facebook's] libra, governments, regulators and central banks around the world have had to expedite their plans and approach to digital assets,” Dave Chapman, executive director at BC Technology Group, told Bloomberg, adding the likes of libra and Walmart's digital currency could ""dramatically"" disrupt finance and payments.China's PBOC has said libra and similar private digital currencies would come under its oversight, potentially limiting their takeup in the country. China has so far had a rocky relationship with bitcoin and crypto, with Beijing cracking down on cryptocurrency trading by shutting down bitcoin exchanges and banning so-called initial coin offerings as a way for companies to raise funds in 2017.However, bitcoin and cryptocurrency mining remains hugely popular in the country, with China home to more than half of the world's bitcoin mining farms."

One ...","Aug 12, 2019,04:12pm EDT","Prague, Czech Republic - June, 2019: Main crypto currency coins next to each other: Bitcoin,... [+] Litecoin, Ripple, Monero, Ethereum.","One of the best (and worst) things about bitcoin, blockchain and cryptocurrencies is just how new the technology and its practical implementations are. Even though there have been many early adapters, the ecosystem as a whole involves a lot of learning, especially for those looking to come up to speed.This represents a massive opportunity as well as a pitfall for those who are on the outside looking in. I like to monitor different courses in the space for my own education as well as for resources to share with others to include them as part of the discussion and learning: I've compiled this list as a set of reliable resources to do just that.1-DFIN 511: Introduction to Digital Currencies (Offered By UNIC)This free online course is taught by Andreas Antonopoulos (author of Mastering Bitcoin) and Antonis Polemitis and it represents the first course in the MSc in Digital Currency offered by UNIC. The course places bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in the broader framework of the history of money, before talking about the practical implementation of bitcoin, other cryptocurrencies, and the evolving relationship between digital currencies and financial institutions, as well as the broader world.It requires no prerequisite knowledge of cryptocurrencies to dive in. There is a final exam component at the end that tests your grasp of the concepts taught. 2- Coinbase LearnThis simple set of interactive flashcards is a great resource for those who want to cover the basics of cryptocurrencies, from buying and selling to mining in a short amount of time. Other than a slight advertisement of Coinbase as safe and regulated, the mini-course remains an objective resource that covers a lot of ground in a surprisingly intuitive and short fashion. A great resource to share with absolute beginners who have little time on their hands and want to get up to speed fast.3-Coursera (Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies) Offered By Princeton UniversityThis free Coursera course introduces basic cryptography concepts and then links them to the basics of Bitcoin. Through videos, the course lecturer explains how decentralization is implemented in practice, how Bitcoin mining works, and how Bitcoins are stored. A short explanation is then given to altcoins and the future of the space.The course is offered by Princeton University, and though no certificate is presented for completion, the knowledge and way it's presented serves as a useful introduction to cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin principles, with an emphasis on the security of Bitcoin. The instructor, Arvind Narayanan is an assistant professor of computer science at Princeton who focuses on the security and stability of Bitcoin -- so that's naturally where his Coursera course gravitates towards.You'll want to get more information about the rest of the ecosystem outside of Bitcoin elsewhere, but otherwise, this is a solid resource.4- EdX (Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies) Offered By UC BerkeleyThis UC Berkeley EdX course differentiates itself by also offering a dedicated section to the Ethereum Virtual Machine, along with a specific section focused on the game theory of what it would take to attack the Bitcoin blockchain -- a fresh approach to enumerating the theoretical security pitfalls of the system.In an interesting twist, the two instructors were undergraduates who are part of the Blockchain @ Berkeley group. The course, like other EdX courses, is free to audit and take but will cost money ($99 USD) if you want a verified certificate to prove your completion.5- 101 Blackboard SeriesThis Youtube series focuses on some specific technical elements within bitcoin, from the components of private keys, to confronting the scaling and centralization risks sometimes inherent in the way bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are implemented in practice.6- Ethereum (Learn Section)The learning section of the ethereum.org website (the official website for ethereum) includes a series of free resources that are curated together in lots of detail about ethereum, the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. It dives into the smart contracts side of ethereum, as well as the basics, and also focuses on knowledge for the latest updates and roadmap for ethereum. At the end, a section is dedicated to criticism and other perspectives on how ethereum could be doing better -- leaving it a fairly well-balanced selection of knowledge about the ecosystem that is packaged like a curated course.7- Udemy (Introduction to Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain)A free course with about two hours worth of video on the basics of distributed systems and its placement in the history of money. Perhaps a good resource for people who want to take a slightly slower pace than the Coinbase flashcards, but don't want to be fully immersed in different elements of blockchain and different parts of the ecosystem as with the fully-fleshed out courses presented by EdX and Coursera.It's a free offering on Udemy that has also been used by about 40,000 other students.8- EdX (Introduction to Hyperledger Blockchain Technologies)This EdX course, offered through the Linux Foundation (which is building the HyperLedger framework) offers an introductory course to blockchain and what role HyperLedger plays in the space, as well as the tools available. It's built for a non-technical business audience, and is an introductory course to blockchain principles outside of the discussion around Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies. The course itself is free, but a verified certificate from EdX will cost $99 USD.9- DeveloperWorks (Blockchain Essentials)This video course, developed in partnership with IBM, and taught by two developers in IBM's blockchain enablement division, goes over the basics of blockchain then leads to a demo and lab component where you can actually work with the HyperLedger framework and practice with it. You'll be able to use the HyperLedger Composer after this course. While slightly more technical, the level is still marked for beginners, even non-technical ones.10- Coinbase EarnWhat's better than free? Earning money for learning. Coinbase offers a selection of introductory courses and quizzes in cryptocurrencies that don't often have a dedicated course, such as Dai (a stablecoin), EOS and privacy focused ZCash. This will allow any learner to get a more holistic view of altcoins and different cryptocurrencies than the standard courses focused on bitcoin and ethereum. You'll earn small amounts of the cryptocurrency in question for answering quiz questions on the topic, so you'll have a small amount to work with in practice after.11- Cryptoeconomics TextbookThis mini-textbook course, offered by Ivey Business School in Canada (associated with the University of Western Ontario), focuses on a crash course to bitcoin in the framework of the economic impact and aspects of bitcoin activities. Consider it a mini-crash course in bitcoin that also ties it to its broader economic impact."

Cryptocurrencies ...","Aug 12, 2019,10:45am EDT",Digital assets are growing in value and popularity,"The attention and money flowing into digital currencies have never been higher. Bitcoin has seen a resurgence in valuation in 2019 and Facebook continues to explore its own digital currency offering, Libra.Cryptocurrencies and digital currencies are a reflection of the world we live in: a time of mass digitalization where traditional assets (e.g., store fronts and photo albums) are moving entirely online.Business is done all around the world, at all hours, and of course online where the two parties never meet. Electronic and digital currencies are a necessity as they make doing business easier. And more than that, they’re a booming business. As of June 2019, over $335 billion is in cryptocurrencies.But at what cost? What happens to all this wealth when the owners die or become incapacitated? Digital currencies and assets might make business and transactions easier, but it has certainly complicated the estate planning process. Traditional methods of writing a will and letting the executor find all the assets won’t work moving forward.The Revised Uniform Fiduciary Access to Digital Asset Act (RUFADAA) establishes the rules and regulations surrounding digital account ownership. It’s important to familiarize yourself with the RUFADAA and update your wills, trusts, and POAs in accordance so your fiduciaries have access to your digital assets.While cryptocurrencies usually have words like “currency,” “gold,” or “coin” in their names, it doesn’t make it so in the United States. The IRS holds the position that cryptocurrencies aren’t currencies. Rather, they’re more like goods and therefore taxed and treated likewise.At the same time, digital currencies are, well, digital in nature and fall under a number of federal and state laws regulating digital assets.At the state level, RUFADAA has been passed into law in most states since 2017. RUFADAA spells out the digital access rights for fiduciaries in the event of the death or incapacity of a digital asset owner.Under RUFADAA, online management systems are atop the hierarchy over any other form of instruction about an account. So, if you set up a beneficiary designation on your online account, it would take precedence over account instructions listed in your will, trust or power of attorney documents.The legal documents just mentioned can provide access to your assets in the event of your death or incapacity. Terms of service agreements (TOSAs) also dictate account control past the original owner. A TOSA is the agreement you quickly scroll through to click “I Agree”, in order to set up or update your online account.With cryptocurrencies or cryptocurrency exchanges, you likely agreed to a TOSA. This would control account access in the event of death or incapacity if no other actions were taken. In states that’ve passed RUFADAA, advanced planning can at least provide your heirs access to the accounts.But account access doesn’t equate to account ownership. RUFADAA specifically states it doesn’t grant any new rights to the account. So, if your TOSA is for a lifetime lease to the underlying asset – say with iTunes or Kindle – that’s all you have. You can’t pass along the underlying song or book to your heirs, regardless of how you set up your wills, trusts or other legal documents.Perhaps even more frustrating is that the service provider or custodian of the online account or digital asset doesn’t need to grant the fiduciary account access. Instead, they have three rights under RUFADAA.First, they can give full access to the online account if legally allowed. Second, they can give partial access. Lastly, they can do a data dump. With many service providers, a data dump of specifically requested information might be the safest option. This would ensure restricted communications or other rights aren’t infringed upon.With a digital currency, the owner has a right to it as he or she would with any other physical good or asset. Upon death, they have a legal right to the underlying cryptocurrency. However, the exchange or account in which the owner used to access the cryptocurrency could be controlled by the will, POA, trust, or TOSA depending on planning.With cryptocurrencies, the risk of losing assets or misplacing them is higher than with traditional assets. Because cryptocurrencies are stored mostly on blockchain technology, a lost password or asset might be almost impossible to recover.The exchanges and online accounts might not be able to retrieve the cryptocurrency depending on how the end user held the asset. Most cryptocurrencies that use blockchain technology create a private key. If the private key is lost, the underlying asset might not be able to be retrieved.This risk is also one of the strengths of blockchain. It’s almost impossible, at least today, for someone to hack your personal key. The personal key is so personal no one else can recover it for you – not even the exchange.So without the keys, you have nothing. Any court order or other legal document won’t be worth the paper it’s printed on if you don’t have the personal key.Digital currencies have value and legally need to be reported as part of the valuation of an estate. This means you need to track tax-basis. For large estates, digital currencies could even be subject to federal estate taxes.While a lot of challenges accompany digital assets when being passed to an heir, positives exist. In many situations you can receive a step-up in basis with digital assets that pass through the estate process. If you have a cryptocurrency with a tremendous amount of gain over your original basis, it could be a good asset to leave to heirs as they can receive a step-up in basis to fair market value at date of death.If you bought a coin for $1,000 and it’s worth $10,000 at date of death, your heirs could receive a basis in the coin of $10,000, wiping out taxes on $9,000 of gain. However, if you sold the asset while alive, you would’ve created a taxable event. (For more information on the taxation of digital currencies read this Forbes article.)As you can see, digital assets and cryptocurrencies make estate planning complex. You need to track where assets exist online and how to access them. If you fail to do proper planning, your digital footprint and assets will likely be stuck in the cloud forever. Here are a few planning tips to practice when it comes to managing your digital assets and currencies.Access information for underlying digital currencyTrack login, passwords and two-step authentication for online service provider exchanges where cryptocurrencies are bought, sold and exchanged.You can purchase encrypted flash drives and external hardware to store digital currencies yourself. Be cautious: If the hard wallet device is destroyed, the asset could be lost.Because RUFADAA provides the rules for giving fiduciaries access to accounts, make sure you update your legal documents in accordance with these new laws and in accordance with your desired wishes.While cryptocurrencies are the focus of the article, this planning is important for all digital assets, including Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, websites, etc.Certain digital assets, like your Facebook page, might not have much monetary value. However, cryptocurrencies will have a basis and valuation that need to be tracked. These assets can impact your estate taxes and the value you pass to heirs.The popularity of digital assets isn’t going away anytime soon. For fiduciaries, taking the proper precautions and understanding the nuances of these assets in estate planning is vital."

Not just because it is an opportunity to make a lot of money if you can call it right, but because it has so much opportunity for pure technical analysis.The bitcoin chart over two yearsThe more efficient a market gets the less useful technical analysis becomes, because market efficiency’s annoying twin is market randomness. The more efficient a market, the more random it becomes and generally long developed markets are very efficient, unlike new ones like Bitcoin. There are many levels of random and it is a fabulous subject to study, but it is not often the traders’ friend.So we have this great set up, one that looks like a replay of the Nasdaq since 2000, just accelerated.Bears say, “You’ve just had your echo rally of the Bitcoin bubble, this is like the commodity market of the 1970s. This run is done. We are going down, down, down.”Bulls will say, “Hey, we are on the way to more than $20,000. Onwards to the moon.” I’m a ""moonist,"" I am slightly ashamed to say. In general, in markets, this tack never pays off, except when it does and then it really does. For every Apple there are 1,000 pump/crash bubbles. If you can spot the odd ""moon shot"" among the plethora of fails, you can make a lot of money. It is not an easy task. So as a Bitcoin moonist I feel like a rich old cynic falling for a pretty lover: prone to ridicule, a broken heart and larceny, failing after so many years of bitter realism to stay on the gritty path of righteousness.So we are at the crossroads again for the bitcoin price. How to play this?First, where are we at: Fundamentally this run is driven by Trump and his crises, China and Iran, plus a sprinkle of Hong Kong troubles.Escalation means up for bitcoin (BTC), resolution means down.Technically we can see that bitcoin is slowly establishing the current levels as an equilibrium price. The range is still impossibly wild to predict direction, but the key thing is the trend and the volatility.Here are the last 3 trends:The last 3 trends on the Bitcoin chartWe can see from this that there is a sweet spot between 10,000 and 12,000 where the market is trying to set a price for BTC with all available information yanking that value around dramatically.If this is a ""good price"" for bitcoin, the volatility will die off reaching the sort of volatility level you can see back in March.Without a dramatic change in the drivers of bitcoin’s price, this calm will occur and that will set up the conditions for the bull/bear move that will follow.While you can now say if BTC goes up much past $14,000, it will go to $20,000 and if it falls under $9,000 by much, it will go to $4,000, that is not much help. As the range tightens as volatility drops, this triggering range will narrow giving us a much less risky set of signals. We must wait to see if that develops rather than there being a sudden unpredictable move.This is what the moonists see unfolding:The optimist's prediction for the bitcoin priceIt absolutely can happen, but like the jilted broken-hearted billionaire, make sure you have a bitcoin prenup in place to make sure being wrong doesn’t wipe you out. That too, can absolutely happen.The key with winning in high reward situations is controlling your risk as much as possible. Otherwise even if you are right the vast majority of the time, you will lose horribly.

forced the airline industry to look again at a market segment ...","Aug 12, 2019,07:07am EDT",Not quite there yet...,"When Norwegian Air Shuttle launched budget flights to America in 2013, it forced the airline industry to look again at a market segment dismissed by many pundits as commercially fanciful: low-cost long-haul flying.Six years on, it’s hard to say whether the gamble has paid off. The airline’s balance sheet is weaker than when it only served short-haul markets. Early competitors like WOW Air and Primera Air have collapsed. Yet Norwegian’s Boeing 787 Dreamliners still criss-cross the Atlantic daily – holding their own against a new breed of low-cost long-haul services run by Europe’s legacy carriers.The decision by Norwegian’s founder, Bjørn Kjos, to relinquish financial and managerial control of the company has meanwhile put a younger generation of executives – including his son, Lars Ola Kjos – in charge of strategic planning.And their opening gambit appears no less ambitious or transformative than the elder Kjos’s foray into long-haul operations.A world away from the business of flight, Norwegian has invested in a cryptocurrency exchange, Norwegian Block Exchange (NBX), which is due to open its virtual doors next month. NBX will make cryptocurrency the most attractive payment channel for Norwegian’s flights – offering discounted fares and blockchain-encoded perks in a bid to hasten what management see as the inevitable decline of the old-world banking system.More immediately, the airline believes this shift to digital currencies will cut costs and release it from the stranglehold of financial middlemen.“Now that we have made the exchange, we see that it could be the heart of a complete new ecosystem,” Stig Aleksander Kjos-Mathisen, NBX’s managing director and the son-in-law of Bjørn Kjos, told me in an interview at Norwegian’s headquarters in Oslo.NBX will launch as a standalone marketplace in September, enabling users to exchange fiat currencies (initially NOK, followed by SEK, DKK, EUR and USD) for digital ones (initially Bitcoin, Ethereum and US Dollar Coin, a USD-pegged stablecoin). Its creation might not have been necessary if a reputable trading platform already existed in Scandinavia, Kjos-Mathisen said, but by building it from scratch the airline has gained “at least a left hand on the steering wheel” of its cryptocurrency future.New financial horizons“We can set the standards ourselves now,” he explained. “We can decide the threshold for security, for KYC [Know Your Customer identity checks].“This positions Norwegian to … be a leader on the technology that is chosen [by the industry]. Also, by owning NBX, we can easily integrate [it with Norwegian’s sales channels] so that the transition between the fiat world and the virtual world is frictionless for us.”By the fourth quarter of this year, merchant solution NBXPay will allow customers to buy flight tickets directly with cryptocurrency. Norwegian will either convert the funds to NOK instantly – minimizing its exposure to cryptocurrency volatility – or it will maintain a USDC balance sheet as working capital. Its stablecoin reserves could then be used for B2B transactions with suppliers that follow its lead into the sphere.“We have discussed with partners if they are willing to look into accepting US Dollar Coin as a way to pay instead of using traditional settlements,” Kjos-Mathisen said, adding that “positive” responses have been received from several “big” suppliers.Norwegian's liquidity has been hampered by credit card acquirers.Side-lining payment processing companies and financial clearing houses in this way has obvious advantages for Norwegian.Airlines typically pay transaction fees of between 1.5% and 2.5% on bookings placed with a credit card. Intermediary acquiring banks then hold back a percentage of revenue to cover the risk of chargeback claims arising from insolvencies. In Norwegian’s case, the amount held back has risen steadily due to concerns about the airline’s financial health – forcing it to issue interest-paying bonds to cover the shortfall.“Why should we wait for our revenues, and then have the credit card acquirers and the credit card companies make a lot of interest just sitting on that money,” asked Lasse Sandaker-Nielsen, Norwegian’s head of communications. “That's why the airline is really interested in this: because it will give us the opportunity to get the liquidity immediately.”Norwegian is not alone in developing blockchain solutions for the aviation industry.Last month, Russia’s S7 Airlines processed more than $1 million worth of payments through a private blockchain being developed with Alfa-Bank. It said the technology speeds up transactions and removes the need for third-party guarantees. Ticketing facilitator ARC has invested in another blockchain, Blockskye, that promises to “increase efficiency, transparency and security” across the multi-party airfare distribution chain.Looking beyond payment settlements, IATA, the airline industry’s main trade group, has identified numerous areas ripe for blockchain innovation. It said the technology’s core strength – immutable data records that provide a single source of trust – has far-reaching implications for tracking of baggage, cargo and spare parts, as well as passenger and crew identity verification.Other sub-sectors such as aircraft financing and maintenance also stand to benefit from blockchain-powered predictive analytics.Yet even as interest across the industry grows, the number of passengers actually willing or able to pay in cryptocurrency remains low. Less than one third of one per cent of the global population is currently believed to own bitcoin.That makes incentivizing the payment channel a top priority for Norwegian and NBX.“At some point, when the technology matures, you'll be using [blockchain] and you won't really notice that you're using it,” Kjos-Mathisen said. “But right now, in the beginning, you will definitely be aware … So you need to incentivize people in the beginning. And then they will start using it because they see it's convenient.”Pay less with bitcoinPassing on savings to customers who pay with cryptocurrency is the most obvious way of building traction. “You can sell the ticket for less and still earn more,” he insisted.Smart contracts that enhance the travel experience will also be marketed heavily. Kjos-Mathisen cited AXA’s flight delay and cancelation insurance product Fizzy as one “very smooth” solution that can influence buying behavior. Fizzy cuts the time it takes to receive payouts by using a smart contract that plugs into global air traffic databases and automatically approves claims.Bitcoin's abstract nature is an obstacle to mainstream adoption.“You put the equivalent of €5 from your wallet into the smart contract. The insurer, AXA in this case, puts in let’s say €40. And then it's written [in code] that if the flight is canceled, the €45 pot will go to you,” he explained. “When you land, you will have the funds in your wallet … The beauty of this is when you have tokens like US Dollar Coin on the Ethereum blockchain, you can actually get [payouts] denominated in dollars. That makes it graspable for most travelers.”Norwegian may also offer people paying in cryptocurrency a higher earning rate for CashPoints, its frequent flyer program. The reward scheme is already being integrated with NBX through a ‘Trade and Fly’ promotion that refunds 10% of trading fees on the exchange to customers’ CashPoints accounts.In all cases, the aim is to bridge the gap between Norwegian’s real-world flight network and NBX’s virtual-world financial services.“NBX is going to be global, so one of the strategies is basically to follow in the footsteps of the airline,” Kjos-Mathisen concluded. “The airline is big in Europe – especially in Scandinavia – but it's starting to become quite big also in the US.

Payments companies have followed the way of thinking that banks had when it came to Bitcoin; and to unashamedly quote Mahatma Gandhi, ‘First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win.’Banks began seeing cryptocurrencies as a non-event, then they decided to laugh at it - Jamie Dimon’s anti-Bitcoin rhetoric springs to mind - then they began fighting it by putting out their own coins - JPM coin - which I think we can all call a win for Bitcoin.For payments companies, it has been a similar path, except I would add another step in there as the likes of Square, Skrill and Circle are actually starting to champion Bitcoin and are backing the digital currency to be the next big thing in the payments space. Improving moneyNews has flooded recently about Square and its cryptocurrency and Bitcoin dealings. The payments company, that is headed up by Twitter CEO and Bitcoin-believer Jack Dorsey, has said it plans to “improve money.”This is being championed by a dedicated cryptocurrency branch, which recently tweeted that it is “close to making our first hire.” What is important to tie to Square’s drive towards cryptocurrency is that they are not looking to go their own direction, but seem to have realised the best option is Bitcoin.Steve Lee, a project manager at Square Crypto even made a number of recent remarks during an “ask me anything” (AMA) session via Twitter that solidify the company’s emphasis on Bitcoin. Dorsey has said previously that they will be focusing on developing the crypto ecosystem in general, and that the company taking steps to improve infrastructure for all. However, Lee’s recent comments seem to point towards Bitcoin being at the center of this drive. When looking deeper into Square’s move towards cryptocurrency, one can quickly get an understanding as to why a payments company like them would want to be at the forefront of this push towards Bitcoin.Earlier this month, Square reported its second-quarter earnings, revealing $125 million in Bitcoin sales through its Cash App, nearly doubling a record first quarter. Their decision to adopt Bitcoin into their offerings is paying off, and paying off at an exponential rate so for them to grow and expand this ecosystem is a no-brainer. Jumping on the bandwagonStill, further afield from the US is European payments company Skrill, which has opened up a tab on its platform to enable the buying and selling of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies through its custodianship.Adoption of cryptocurrencies are starting to reach critical mass, and accessing them is only getting easier through these payment companies . Skrill boasts 40 million users and by integrating their Bitcoin buying and selling services, a huge base of people looking for alternative payment solutions separate from banks are exposed.Skrill is part of a billion-dollar multinational payments group called PaySafe, based in London with that parent company also pushing Bitcoin and cryptocurrency adoption through a partnership with American cryptocurrency exchange, Coinbase. It was through this partnership that Coinbase was able to roll out its cryptocurrency cards to those in the UK with both firms obviously keen to see the use of cryptocurrencies for payments be as simple as fiat currencies. One name missing from this drive for Bitcoin adoption in the payments sphere is PayPal, who to be fair are not totally removed. PayPal joined a Series A investment in Cambridge Blockchain, a startup working to give individuals a way to own their own online identities without the need of middlemen like Facebook, in April.They are also part of the Libra Association, aiding Facebook to bring its cryptocurrency to the masses. However, their interest in the ready-to-go digital currency solution that is Bitcoin seems very minimal.Calling for regulationOne big aspect that these payments companies will also be weary of, and considering all the time, is the regulatory direction governments are going. Currently, in the US, there are a number of hearings in the Senate that could be setting the stage for how far cryptocurrencies will be regulated. Some are fearful of the US government being to harsh on this innovative technology. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse even wrote an open letter asking for Senate not to “paint us all with the same brush.”Moreover, Circle, another payments company that is champion the use and growth of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, has put itself in the firing line for the Senate. Circle’s CEO, Jeremy Allaire, was the lone crypto-industry representative who testified before the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs during a hearing titled, “Examining Regulatory Frameworks for Digital Currencies and Blockchain.” earlier this week.He spoke to Bloomberg afterwards saying that he fully believes that the cryptocurrency space needs to be regulated, not only for the protection of the industry, but to boost the US and its role as a leading technological super power. “The increase in proliferation of digital asset projects outside the U.S., the movement of companies to leave the U.S. and projects to get started outside the U.S. is definitely getting people’s attention,” Allaire told Bloomberg.He continued:“I think it is ultimately going to lead to, ultimately legislative initiatives to try and ensure that there are appropriate safeguards and investor protections but also clarity, which is much needed to allow the technology and industry to flourish.”A payments baseBlockchain has been gaining huge momentum within enterprises for its ability to increase efficiency. In banking, both blockchain and cryptocurrencies are getting institutional boosts, especially for the ability to move value across borders, but primarily in the form of permissioned blockchains. However, it is the payments companies, who were innovative enough to break away from banking payments when they first came to markets, who are now breaking more boundaries with Bitcoin.These companies are institutional enough now to be trusted, but innovative enough not to be afraid of Bitcoin. Potentially, this is where Bitcoin’s mass-adoption fate will be realised. "

This bull market is over.”,"That was the thinking of Joe Kennedy in late 1928, after getting a tip to buy Hindenburg during a shoeshine.  Kennedy soon sold his entire stock portfolio and avoided one of the biggest stock market crashes in history.The Greater Fool Theory states that it is possible to make money by buying securities, whether or not they are overvalued, by selling them for a profit at a later date. This is because there will always be someone (i.e. a bigger or greater fool) who is willing to pay a higher price.But what happens when there is no “greater fool”, and all that is left are sellers?You guessed it, a crash.When Joe Kennedy saw a shoeshine boy giving stock tips, he knew that the market was likely to run out of Greater Fools soon.  And it turned out that he was right.The “hype cycle”, a branded term by the research firm Gartner, provides us with a graphical representation of the introduction, maturity, and acceptance of new technologies.Consumer Hype CycleAs you can see, it is often the case that new technologies like cryptocurrencies will see a euphoric “gold rush” of inflated expectations, followed by a crash in interest. In fact, this “trough of disillusionment” is usually accompanied by a dismissal of the technology (and even mockery of its proponents) by the general public. Finally, technologies will begin to take hold with real-world applications during the slope of enlightenment, before becoming truly productive in the world.To understand our position in the hype cycle now, it is instructive to look at LikeFolio’s data on each cryptocurrency.  Through their proprietary technology, the firm can give us some serious insights by showing us how many people are talking about using or buying the cryptocurrency in question.For example, the following is a chart showing the amount of social-media chatter around bitcoin over time:Chatter about bitcoin is starting to recoverNotice a familiar shape? A massive uptick in interest in 2018 (peaking as Bitcoin prices peaked near $20,000), followed by a fast a furious drop back down into what many consider to be the trough of disappointment.But now things are starting to get interesting again, as conversations around buying and using Bitcoin are starting to grow out of the trough, which could be the beginning of the slope of enlightenment phase.And it’s important to note that this view is not a look at the price of Bitcoin… this is a view of how many people are actually talking about interacting and using the technology itself – i.e. ADOPTION.Between the LikeFolio consumer insights data above, and the recent price action in Bitcoin, it’s clear that the public’s interest in cryptocurrency is getting some wind back in its sails.Additionally, it’s clear that we are nowhere near the late 2017 levels of expectations, which is likely a good thing in the long run because nothing can derail a new technology quite as abruptly as failing to live up to consumer (and investor!) expectations.So we will continue to watch this space with great interest, looking for continued clues around consumer adoption for confirmation that we are truly in the “Slope of Enlightenment.  That could last much longer, and produce much larger profits for investors than most people are expecting."

[+] 10, 2019. Hong Kong is in its ninth week of demonstrations that began in response to a proposed extradition law but have expanded to include other grievances and demands for more democratic freedoms. (AP Photo/Kin Cheung)","Hong Kong has been engulfed in a series of protests as tensions over its relationship with Mainland China have been inflamed by recent proposed extradition legislation to the Mainland. Protests have continued for a tenth straight weekend and at the arrival hall of the International Airport, a sit-in of protesters dressed in black now greets visitors.In many ways, Hong Kong has become a futuristic 21st century site for protests. Protesters are using lasers to shine through tear gas and to try to confuse and distract police officers on the other side. Telegram was attacked by Chinese servers in a denial-of-service attempt, as protesters using the app to organize found themselves monitored and arrested even if they were only virtual participants. And young protesters refused to use a centralized form of payment (Octopus) because they feared leaving a trail of data for the Hong Kong government to be able to tag who was participating in protests or not, all in the backdrop of a dystopian fear of facial recognition.Cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin were built to address several of the most pressing points in the Hong Kong protests, which are at the forefront of what it means to protest against a state equipped with all of the sophisticated technologies of the 21st century and the unrestrained ability to weaponize those capabilities against its citizenry.Many cryptocurrencies are moving towards enabling transactional anonymity, and a host of tools exist to make it easier to anonymize transactions. Monero and Zcash were built with those principles in mind -- a trait built in foresight for an age where dissidents fear being recognized by a central entity. This has led to a premium in cryptocurrencies traded with Hong Kong dollars.Initially, as protests broke out around mid-June, Bitcoin traded at about a $160 USD premium on TideBit, a Hong Kong based exchange. As protests have worn on, that premium still persists, with the latest price of Bitcoin on TideBit at $11477.34 USD, about $80 USD higher than the current rate on Coinmarketcap. This is not altogether uncommon on Asian exchanges, especially ones that are trading in uncommon currency pairs which may face some capital controls (Korean-based exchanges that trade in Korean Won, for example, typically see large price premiums from the average global rate) -- yet it does show a continuing demand for Bitcoin in Hong Kong.Bitcoin itself has seen a surge since June 9th, the largest public protest in Hong Kong's history. From about $8,000 USD, it now sits close to $11,300 USD, an increase of about 41.25%. With Bitcoin/Chinese Yuan pairs trading at a premium and the broader US-China trade war in the background, as well as a ton of other factors built in to the ambiguous mess that is Bitcoin pricing, there's not as much you can read into the tea leaves -- but it's certainly true that as protests in Hong Kong have surged, so has demand for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general.Bitcoin is built to be a distributed datastore with no central ownership or censorship. No state, without an extraordinary investment in computing power, can control transactions between Bitcoin addresses. There is no ability to censor monetary movements between different users, even if they may be regarded as a dissident by one state or another -- and it is difficult to collect raw data categories beyond what members of the public would know is accessible through public explorers and aggregative analyzers.This helps allay the concerns many protesters have with their current payments systems. Cryptocurrencies have many of the same convenient features as digital cash, but much less of the downsides of centralized control and surveillance.With about 39 Bitcoin/crypto ATMs servicing the Hong Kong area and Pundi X putting Point-of-Sale devices in local restaurants, allowing for the easy spend of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, Hong Kong has always been forward-facing when it comes to cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrencies are part of the ""one country, two systems"" tension that has made Hong Kong uniquely positioned to take advantage of the fact that it is not a subject to the cryptocurrency ban in mainland China.Residents of Mainland China cannot trade in Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies on exchanges, and neither can companies in Mainland China raise funds through initial coin offerings. Meanwhile, cryptocurrencies are thriving in Hong Kong.While this may not offer the same level of tension as the political nature of Hong Kong nominations (which must be vetted by the Mainland) or proposed legislation, since shelved, that would have helped extradite prisoners to the Mainland, it is once again another reminder of the separate and unique nature of Hong Kong's governance -- and something that might be lost if Hong Kong's structure were further collapsed and placed into Mainland China, where the system is designed for all power to flow upwards to the central confines of the Chinese Communist Party's Politburo Standing Committee.So as a dystopian cat-and-mouse game emerges in Hong Kong, with a technologically sophisticated police chasing protesters for their faces, a refusal to use centralized digital cash, and arrests of protesters for their participations in virtual forums and state-mounted attacks on communications apps -- cryptocurrency has quite a role to play in what may be the opening act of the dystopian, cyberpunk protests of the future."

[+] analysis.","Bitcoin, the world's most prominent digital currency, has produced more robust risk-adjusted returns over the last year than rival gold or the benchmark S&P 500 index, according to data provided by market research firm TradeBlock.To arrive at this conclusion, TradeBlock leveraged the Sortino Ratio, which is similar to the Sharpe Ratio but penalizes only downside volatility when calculating risk-adjusted returns.The Sortino Ratio measures an asset's gains, relative to the upside volatility that it experiences.TradeBlock looked at risk-adjusted returns since some assets generate very compelling returns, but also suffer significant price fluctuations.[Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.] Research MethodologyFor this particular analysis, the market research firm specifically looked at the period between August 13, 2018, and August 9, 2019, sourcing data on bitcoin, S&P 500 and gold from TradeBlock.com, Yahoo! Finance and GoldPrice.org, respectively. By examining this information, TradeBlock determined that bitcoin had a Sortino Ratio of 1.97 during the period, while gold stood at 1.06 and the S&P 500 at 0.25.Interestingly enough, this analysis also looked at digital currency ether, which had a ratio of 0.45.Several analysts weighed in on TradeBlock's methodology, specifically its decision to leverage the Sortino Ratio in its calculations.Sortino Ratio""Given Bitcoin's parabolic rises in the past, it's easy to see why one might prefer to use the Sortino ratio, as the Sharpe ratio inherently biases against extremely positive returns,"" said Yazan Barghuthi, founder and CEO of blockchain firm Jibrel.Evan Kuo, CEO and cofounder of digital currency firm Ampleforth, also offered his point of view.""The Sortino ratio views upside volatility as a good thing, and only tries to limit downside co-variance, which makes good sense in the case of a highly volatile asset like Bitcoin,"" he emphasized.""In a way the Sortino ratio exposes a more nuanced use-case for Bitcoin in the context of a portfolio. The key is identifying assets that might have high upside potential amidst a macro-economic slowdown.""More than one expert emphasized that both of the aforementioned ratios have their place when evaluating risk-adjusted returns.""Both ratios are quite good and both are legitimate,"" said Tim Enneking, managing director of Digital Capital Management. ""The Sharpe Ratio is a bit more commonly used, however."" Paul Daniel, head of global sales at Boomerang Capital Inc., also weighed in.""Whether you are using the Sharpe Ratio to calculate overall volatility or the Sortino ratio to measure downside volatility, these measurements can be added to your strategy as another means of evaluation,"" he stated.ConsiderationsWhile looking at risk-adjusted returns can he highly valuable in evaluating a potential investment, there are several other factors that traders should consider, noted analysts.Even though bitcoin outperformed gold and the S&P 500 over the last year, according to the aforementioned TradeBlock analysis, the digital currency is still notoriously volatile, experiencing very strong gains in 2017, only to be followed by sharp losses.Enneking emphasized these sharp price fluctuations, stating that:""Even if risk-adjusted returns exceed the S&P over a given, select period, in general, the risk is much higher.""""That being said, as I've noted frequently before, every portfolio should have a crypto 'slice,'"" meaning that every portfolio should incorporate at least some digital currency. Barghuthi provided some closing thoughts on the matter:""I think the key take away from these figures is that bitcoin is gradually earning its place as a sensible risk adjusted investment in both institutional and retail investor portfolios."" Disclosure: I own some bitcoin, bitcoin cash and ether. "

These factors in concert now with the gradual erosion of globalism and the recent rise of trade wars applies added pressure to manipulate fiat currencies.”This trend is most evident in the US-China trade war. The two countries have been manipulating their currencies to make-up for failed trade talks, according to Karasulu. “We saw this dynamic with the reactionary drop in the Chinese Yuan with failed trade talks,” he says. “The US is doing the same, but through an indirect method by dropping interest rates, which worsens the debt spiral as money gets cheaper to loan.”The result? “The people don't have faith in the independence of central banks anymore,” continues Karasulu.“People are worried about the instability of traditional currencies - I've seen uptake in crypto in the UK to hedge against the loss in the pound,” says Richard Dennis MSc, CEO and Founder at temtum. “A lot of people have lost trust in the government so they are putting their cash into non-government or company controlled coins.”Like Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies. “Monetary policy based on math, and not government officials or agencies, is starting to sound more appealing to investors, says Chris Reinertsen, Chief Marketing Officer of Rhythm Technologies. “Bitcoin has been designed to be an eventual safe haven from government controlled currencies since its inception, but as trade and currency wars are being waged, more and more investors are looking for alternatives to avoid repeats of the last major bear market.”Karasulu agrees.  “The obvious appeal of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are their immunity to manipulation, and unlike gold, or other precious metals, there's no physical issue of safekeeping. No institution can siphon away the value of the Bitcoin you hold,” he notes. “No quantitative easing will ever take place. No country will devalue it in a currency war over trade tensions.”That sounds too good to be true. Central banks and governments will never let any decentralized currency take the place of national currencies, as discussed in previous pieces here."

There are no more Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) to distract the crypto ecosystem and the building mentality is back on. This post-ICO and post-useless-PR-partnerships age urges the blockchain community to be less focused on the current price of bitcoin and more focused on producing meaningful services and advancements. Big projects from established enterprises like Facebook Libra are taking all the media space now and this is net positive for the enterprise blockchain space as well.The first half of this year was full of blockchain developments led by large enterprises in almost all important sectors, including insurance, financial services, supply chain, healthcare and trade finance.Credit: GettyThere is a huge benefit in joining a specialized industry-focused blockchain consortium because you sit at the same table with your main competitors but at the same time you work toward the same goal. You are not alone in figuring out the benefits, implementations and roll-out of distributed ledger technologies. There is also a financial benefit when commonly building applications as sometimes the membership fee is lower than the cost of hiring and training blockchain developers. Some of the big names in leading blockchain consortia networks that have made significant progress so far in 2019 are:The whole private consortia ecosystem is still in early development but the right mentality is there. We will see how the technology develops over time to support those formations. A popular approach might be a hybrid infrastructure, where consortium members interact with each other in a permissioned environment or a shard but eventually anchor to some public blockchain for audit and reference purposes.From the enterprise blockchain technology perspective, this first half of 2019 was pretty interesting and the major blockchain platforms made progress in not only improving and maturing their services but releasing new products. The general sentiment has been to focus on privacy, consensus options and digital asset standardization in anticipation of the tokenization revolution.2019 has proven to be a year when blockchain technology has gotten down to business. Going further from the wild early days of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, blockchain is making large steps in nearly every industry, from insurance to pharmaceuticals to luxury goods. Backed by large enterprises, we saw the maturing of the underlying protocols and improvements in security and privacy aspects. There is still a lot to be done as the core blockchain infrastructure needs to mature enough to be prime-time ready, and like Q1 and Q2, the second half of 2019 is certain to be filled with new developments."

A large number of mainstream players have thrown their hats into the blockchain ring, looking to improve various business operations through harnessing the technology made famous for underpinning bitcoin.

TCS Looks At Blockchain Solutions With Two Categories In MindTCS utilizes a ""two-prong"" approach, Srinivasan explained. The first prong or ""pillar"" targets enterprise blockchain application, he noted. In this case, TCS might serve enterprise players seeking to boost areas such as ""productivity"" or ""efficiency,"" or grow ""their market share"" via blockchain, the TCS blockchain head mentioned. “There [is] more emphasis that is coming in for a business case, total cost of ownership, on some of these,"" Srinivasan said.

""That might involve collaborative effort in terms of bringing the parties together, as well as investing on platforms that will enable such ecosystems to operate."" he added. TCS has seen accounts of success in the fields of aviation and digital identity regarding this ecosystem category focus, Srinivasan noted. The TCS blockchain leader, however, said he could not provide specific involved players quite yet.Srinivasan noted TCS has ""solutions"" and ""services"" for its enterprise prong.

Latest Network",https://www.forbes.com/sites/darrynpollock/2019/08/13/nokia-lenovo-and-others-clamouring-for-blockchain-benefits-from-ibms-latest-network/,"It's Make Or Break For Bitcoin. IBM has become a driving force for the 
growth of blockchain technology, especially in an enterprise arena.","Aug 13, 2019,05:47am EDT",(Photo by David Ramos/Getty Images),"Blockchain trendsetter in the enterprise space, IBM, have announced another blockchain network designed to improve supplier qualification, validation, onboarding, and life cycle information management.In collaboration with Chainyard, the supplier supply chain known as Trust Your Supplier (TYS) looks to be an enticing prospect for major enterprises who are clamouring to drive this new, relevant, use-case for blockchain.Anheuser-Busch InBev, GlaxoSmithKline, Lenovo, Nokia, Schneider Electric and Vodafone, all leaders in their respective fields of Tech, Telecom, Pharma, Beverage and Manufacturing Companies, are the founding members of this consortium, ready to reap the benefits of being part of this nascent technology.IBM has become a driving force for the growth of blockchain technology, especially in an enterprise arena. This can be seen in other supply chain networks based on the blockchain they have gotten off the ground, such as Food Trust and Trade Lens.Both these previous blockchain networks have attracted massive companies on the scale of Nestle, Walmart and Maersk to not only use the technology but help expand its possibility and reach. This has lead to successes in shipping and food tracking for the companies mentioned above, but also growth in blockchain application.Now, still dealing with the supply chain, but concerning on-boarding suppliers, IBM is looking to advance the technology and use cases in this arena with huge enterprises excited to be a part of the journey. A new use caseThe common goal of TYS is to solve the challenges related to supplier information management. Traditional methods of managing suppliers often involve cumbersome manual processes, which make it challenging to verify identities and track documents like ISO certifications, bank account information, tax certifications, and certificates of insurance throughout the lifecycle of a supplier. By using a decentralized approach and an immutable audit trail built on blockchain, TYS is designed to eliminate time-consuming manual processes and help reduce the risk of fraud and errors, which could ultimately create frictionless connectivity across supply chains. David Post, Managing Director of IBM Blockchain Ventures, spoke to me about this new journey into the emerging technology, as well as IBM's growing reputation in the space. ""Drawing on IBM's depth and breadth of experience with over 500 blockchain engagements, we continue to refine and improve our approach to convening blockchain networks,"" said Post.""The starting point for any blockchain network is a compelling initial use case, and supplier onboarding and validation is a well-recognized point for both Chief Procurement Officers and their suppliers alike."" ""As a result of both our approach to network development and the strength of the use case, there has been strong enterprise interest in Trust Your Supplier, and we expect the network to scale rapidly.""Grabbing the chance to be involvedIndeed, Post alludes to part of the success they have had in not only pinpointing the compelling use-cases but also in on-boarding some of the biggest companies in their sectors. Leena Taimi, Head of Procurement Operations and Strategy at Nokia, explained to me what entice them to be a foundational member of this new blockchain network.""The potential to significantly speed up the supplier on-boarding process, as well as testing the potential use case for blockchain technology was a big attraction. Working with IBM was a massive benefit here given their experience in this area and the multiple partnerships they are engaged with.""Of course, these new consortia and advances in blockchain technology are coming at a time where most of these companies already have some internal blockchain process going on.Nokia has been looking at blockchain technology around the business,"" added Taimi. ""However, within the Procurement environment, this is the first real-world test of its capabilities. The opportunity to collaborate with like-minded companies in different sectors was also a benefit. There are things that we can learn and share to improve ways of doing business and engage professionally with our suppliers.""Lenovo also explained to me the advantages of being at the forefront of a better supplier onboarding system.""Lenovo joined the TYS network to create transparency, security, and compliance upstream in our supply chain. This future program will enable us to onboard and manage our global supply chain in an optimized fashion,"" said Renee Ure, Chief Supply Chain Officer for Lenovo's Data Center Group.They, like Nokia, have their internal blockchain systems on the go but understand the importance of being part of a collaborative effort.""Lenovo is leveraging blockchain technology in our Buy/Sell process and Enterprise Asset Management. These networks are live today, as we continue to scope several additional use cases across the business,"" added Ure.""In a blockchain network, efficiencies are gained as the ecosystem continues to scale. It is important to collaborate with other companies across industries to grow these network solutions and share best practices. Supply chain organizations, regardless of the sector in which they are operating, consist of similar processes and transactions that cross multiple entities.""UnmissableIt is becoming clear that an enterprise blockchain is no longer an option for enterprises, rather a necessity. However, unlike previous technological solutions which can be rolled out with ease across all sectors, blockchain requires a tiered approach when it comes to solution building. As Ure and Taimi explain, working towards a blockchain solution internally will only get a company so far, blockchain and its open-source nature are leading companies to collaborate and work together to make the system more efficient. Thus, when a trusted name like IBM pushes the envelope in one area, it is attractive for enterprises to join in to reap the benefits, but at the same time, grow the technology, its application, and use cases. Enterprises that can successfully take advantage of the burgeoning blockchain space will be well placed down the line when their efficiencies are taken care off. It is not about picking up the technology as the latest buzzword; it is about making sure one does not miss out.   "

We have to ...","Aug 13, 2019,06:20pm EDT","Bill Nygren, a renowned value investor, is manager of the Oakmark Fund, Oakmark Select Fund and Oakmark Global Select Fund, as well as chief investment officer for U.S. equities at Harris Associates, a Chicago-based firm with approximately $118 billion in assets. His Oakmark colleague, Win Murray, co-manages the Oakmark Select Fund with Nygren and serves as director of U.S. equity research at Harris Associates.","Revered investor Bill Nygren and his colleague Win Murray manage funds at Chicago's Harris... [+] Associates, which has about $118 billion in assets under management.Together, the two gurus answered questions about investing that GuruFocus readers asked recently. This is the second part of that interview. Read the first part here. GuruFocus question: How do you analyze the management of companies?Win Murray: Individual investors shouldn’t despair that they don’t have the opportunity to meet with management teams. Most of our analysis of company managements comes from doing a deep dive into their track records, in both operations (how they have grown sales and controlled costs historically) and capital allocation (how they have spent their discretionary cash flows and what their acquisition/divestiture scorecard looks like). If we see that a company issued relatively cheap stock to make a large, expensive acquisition, we can frequently close the book right there and move on.We do try to meet with management teams before making investments. We have to be careful, though, because it’s easy to be impressed by a CEO. They tend to be charismatic, confident, well-spoken and with such deep knowledge of their companies that they can “wow” you with answers to any fact-based questions you may have.This is why, when we meet with management teams, we try to ask questions that give us some sense for how the executives would think in different situations rather than discuss what’s happening with their business units or the marketplace today. Bad questions would be, “What are you currently seeing in your European end markets?” or “So what do you expect the government to do on tariffs?” Good questions would be, “What part of your current capital spending plan do you believe will lead to the highest returns, and why aren’t you spending twice as much on it?” or “What skill sets would you like to see added to your board of directors to help you best run the company?” We want to try to put executives into positions where we can see them thinking about different scenarios rather than giving the same standard answers.It’s also always important to check the proxy statements to see how the executives are being paid. We don’t want to see people getting compensated for sales growth or profit growth. We look for metrics with “denominators,” like sales per share, earnings per share, return on invested capital, etc. We always want to make sure that the costs of growth are being properly captured.Question: How are you valuing News Corp, and which of its assets do you consider most valuable? Can you comment on your opinion of management? Bill Nygren: We purchased News Corp. based on an asset-by-asset valuation model. We believe that its ad-supported real estate websites (both REA Group and Move.com) are its most valuable assets. But after owning the stock for several years, not seeing an increase in our estimate of per-share value and not observing management take steps, such as repurchasing stock with excess cash, we decided to sell the majority of our position last quarter. We believe the stock is statistically cheap relative to the value of its disparate businesses, but other stocks also look cheap where we have more confidence in the management and the growth trajectory of per-share value.Question: What's a go-to resource for you for investment ideas and inspiration, beyond typical business publications and websites?Nygren: Some investors suffer from a “not invented here” syndrome, which can cause them to look negatively at any idea that originated outside their own organization. One of the things I believe we do well at Oakmark is realizing we haven’t cornered the market on good investment thinking. We all read about what our competitors are doing with an eye toward using some of their best ideas.I like reading books about successful investors, especially those who use a different style than we do. I admire Warren Buffett and would say if you are going to read about only one investor, pick him. But rather than reading a seventh book about Buffett and maybe learning something new about his diet, read about great growth investors or commodity traders. The genesis of our work rigorously tracking how company fundamentals have deviated from our expectations came more from commodity traders than from other value investors.We also read the quarterly reports from other funds that invest similarly to Oakmark. When a firm we respect takes a new position in a stock we don’t own, we like to research the idea and at least understand why we don’t agree with them. If we can’t find a reason to disagree, we are humble enough to admit that other investors can sometimes find good ideas before we do.Question: In your metrics, do you take off-balance-sheet liabilities into account?Murray: Yes, we make every effort to do so. Always think about valuing a company as if it’s your family’s business. Environmental liabilities, multi-employer pensions, potential legal judgments, lease obligations, etc., would be important to you as a business owner because in all cases they have the potential to intercept your cash flows, so they should be included when valuing an enterprise.Question: How does your view on Apple change in light of the ongoing U.S.-China trade war? Nygren: Apple imports phones from China and the Chinese market for Apple products is important and growing, so a trade war with China definitely increases the volatility of the company’s short-term earnings. But this provides a good example of how Oakmark’s very long-term time horizon forces us to look past the ups and downs of news cycles and instead look at long-term fundamentals.It seems that opinions about how long the trade war will last range from a few weeks on the short end to after the 2020 election on the long end. We own stocks based on what we believe investors should be willing to pay for them five to seven years from now, or about 2025. I haven’t heard anyone speculate that the trade war could last that long. Because of that, the only change in our valuation due to the trade war of companies doing business in China is a modest decrease in our estimate of cash generated in the next year or two. That generally lowers our estimate of value by at most a couple percentage points and doesn’t change our opinion on whether or not the stock is undervalued.Question: Why do you own no Berkshire Hathaway? It would seem to me to be an almost ideal holding for Oakmark.Nygren: We have tremendous respect for Berkshire’s CEO Warren Buffett, and he is one of my investing heroes. But that said, Oakmark’s very positive view toward Buffett is in no way a non-consensus opinion. Because of that near universal admiration, the company’s stock has never appeared to us to be cheaper than the other financial services or diversified companies that we’ve owned. Berkshire stock is a reminder that having a positive view toward a business or its managers is not sufficient to make a stock attractive. The company will be undervalued only if that positive view is not already incorporated in the stock price.Question: Can you expand on the process that you follow to understand the “margin of safety” on your investments?Murray: The difference between a stock’s current price and our estimate of the company’s intrinsic value per share is the margin of safety. We spend much of our analytical time attempting to determine an accurate estimate of intrinsic value.Once we’ve done that, it’s easy to see the margin of safety.However, consider a scenario in which we believe Company A, with relatively little debt, is worth $100 per share, and we also believe Company B, with a lot of debt, is also worth $100 per share. Let’s also say that both companies were selling for $60 per share. Do they both have the same margin of safety? It would appear so at the equity level, but in total enterprise value terms, not at all!Our estimates of intrinsic value are at the enterprise level, taking all net liabilities into account. If Company A has net debt equal to 15% of its market cap while Company B has net debt equal to 700% of its market cap, then the same $40 equity margin of safety on the stock prices is far less risky at Company A. A 10% error in our estimate of Company A’s intrinsic enterprise value ($115) would only mean an 11.5% decline in our estimate of per share equity value, whereas if our Company B value ($800) is 10% too high, it would mean our $100 target stock price would be high by 80%!So please, always look at company valuations at the enterprise level to ensure that your margins of safety are as safe as they appear.Question: What do you know about investing now, that you wish you knew when you started?Murray: When I started in this industry at age 26 after business school (and a full seven years before I joined Oakmark), I was given a sector to analyze (basic materials) and was essentially told to pick stocks that would go up. The idea that Consolidated Papers, for instance, was “worth” twice the current quote to a strategic buyer was irrelevant if the coated paper cycle was turning down because analysts were judged purely on how their stocks performed over short periods of time, typically one year.I was being trained not how to value businesses, but instead to try to understand what news flow would likely occur over the next few quarters and then figure out what other market participants were thinking to determine whether it was already priced in or not. This is a perfectly interesting job, but it’s most definitely not how to make money in this field over many decades. Pretty much every investor you’ve ever heard of with a 25-plus year track record has made their money the exact same way: buying companies at a big discount to what they’re worth (usually when they’re terribly out of favor) and holding them until the cash flows eventually drive the companies’ prices to fair value.Luckily, I was taken under the wing of an old-school value investor who helped show me what investing really is. By the time I joined the Oakmark team, I was well versed in the philosophy. But as director of research, I still see countless candidates who believe that “investing” involves picking stocks that “work,” as opposed to buying companies at a big discount to the present value of their future cash flows.I remember interviewing a very intelligent analyst candidate in late 2012. He worked at a well-known but struggling hedge fund and was in charge of analyzing the transportation sector for them. We were discussing FedEx, a $90 stock at the time, and an Oakmark holding. The analyst had done a lot of work to determine the company was probably worth $160 per share, yet his firm didn’t own it. I was surprised he saw that much upside yet held no position. He explained that trans-Pacific trade figures hadn’t shown any sign of turning and he couldn’t recommend any stock without a catalyst lest he subject himself to significant career risk at his shop. A year later, catalyst-free FedEx was $40 higher and a year after that it had doubled.As a young investor, I never realized how much of the week-to-week stock market movements come from “investors” who are chasing psychology and news flow. It flies in the face of the efficient market theory, but so many “investment” firms have created incentives for their analysts based on 12-month stock performance that it’s believable to see occur. Luckily for us, I don’t see this industry model changing anytime soon, so market inefficiencies should continue to exist even in the largest cap companies.Nygren: I think the most common tendency of young investment professionals is to rely almost entirely on quantitative skills and ignore qualitative positives or negatives of businesses and their managers. I was no exception. It is really just natural because fresh graduates have better quantitative skills than their bosses. And if you’ve got the biggest hammer, you want everything to look like a nail. But I can’t think of one investment we’ve made at Oakmark where we developed an advantage over other investors by “outmodeling” them.With experience comes an appreciation for the qualitatives that are hard to incorporate in a model. Our most successful stocks typically include a differentiated point of view on the quality of management or the quality of the business. As a young analyst, I always started by looking for really cheap stocks, and after concluding they were indeed underpriced, I then tried to convince myself that neither the businesses nor managements were bad enough to offset the statistical cheapness. Having completed all the valuation work before even meeting the management, you can guess how strongly biased I was to conclude that they were at least acceptable!Today, I encourage our analysts to reverse that process: Find businesses and managements they’d be excited to own and then do the work to see if the valuation is attractive. If it isn’t attractive now, monitor the stock price so you are prepared to act when it is more attractive. It is really amazing to see over the course of our holding period, typically five to seven years, how much value a great management can add that never was incorporated in our model, and conversely, how much value a bad management can destroy.This article originally appeared HERE. "

Rather than a playful extension of its app, these glasses appear to be seen as a possible foundation from which an AR ecosystem can emerge—but only time will tell whether users are ready to get the message.Correction: this article has been edited to reflect that transfer experience is via WiFi rather than cable."

We didn’t know if people would take us seriously. We weren’t even sure we'd hit our original $250k target. But this community from around the world came together and helped make VR a reality. Fast forward just a few years later, and VR is changing people's lives every day. This is because of you. With Mitchell's exit, there are now no original founders left at the parent company, with Palmer Luckey leaving in 2017 because of pro-Trump affiliations and Brendan Iribe quitting in 2018 amid rumors of a Rift 2 cancellation. In fact, there are no founders left among any of the company's major acquisitions of Instagram, Oculus, and WhatsApp.Mitchell claims to be taking time for himself in the wake of this exit, and made no announcement of new ventures. He expressed enthusiasm for the future of VR and Facebook.""What's next for me: I'm taking time to travel, be with family, and recharge,"" Mitchell wrote. ""Of course, I'll still be part of this community, but I'll have a much smaller role to play. I expect the incredible team at Facebook to continue to surprise and delight us on this mission to build the next computing platform. I can't wait to see what comes next.""Facebook acquired Oculus for what was originally thought to be $2B, but turned out to be closer to $3B in 2014. Since then, the company has released several different headsets, including Rift, Go, Rift S, and Quest—the latter of which sold $5M in content in the two weeks following its launch."
