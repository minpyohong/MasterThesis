August 10, 2019
","Ever since the post-April cryptocurrency bull market, Bitcoin has been gradually consolidating its status as a store of value. This was confirmed most emphatically on July 11, when Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell told the U.S. Senate banking committee that investors use the cryptocurrency ""as an alternative to gold.""","""It's a store of value, a speculative store of value, like gold,"" he added, providing further weight to the theory that Bitcoin's relative lack of correlation with other assets makes it a safe haven. But assuming that this theory is largely true, it needs to be asked whether other cryptocurrencies are now superior as means of payment.Well, while it is true that other cryptocurrencies can accommodate more transactions per second and are often cheaper to use, it's also arguable that Bitcoin's growing utility as a store of value makes it more suitable as a means of payment. Moreover, its decentralized network is still the biggest and safest. Still, new coins such as Facebook's Libra might pose a challenge to Bitcoin's potential dominance.Despite recent progress, Bitcoin still hasn't witnessed a massive, step-change leap in its utility as an actual currency. Yes, SegWit adoption has steadily increased to around 35% over the past couple of years, but even with 100% uptake, Bitcoin's capacity would remain only a fraction of Visa's, for instance.At the same time, the much-hyped Lightning Network is still a long way from being deployed as a fully workable scaling solution. And as Glen Goodman, the author of The Crypto Trader, tells Cryptonews.com, this could hurt Bitcoin's usefulness as a means of payment.""A crypto for everyday payments needs to be massively scalable, allowing thousands of payments per second,"" he says. ""It must be simple to use and allow fast, cheap, secure payments with protection against fraud.""Arguably, Bitcoin doesn't quite fit this bill at the moment, with other cryptocurrencies demonstrating greater scalability, speed and cost-effectiveness. For instance, XRP, Dash and Bitcoin Cash all currently provide faster throughput.As Cryptonews.com wrote last year, other tokens such as Dash and Bitcoin Cash are witnessing a steady uptick in their merchant adoption rates. Dash announced in January that there was nearly 4,700 retailers throughout the globe which accepted the currency, while just over 4,500 merchants accept altcoins such as XRP, Ether and Bitcoin Cash through CoinGate alone. As Coingate told Cryptonews.com earlier this year, while the most popular payment option is still Bitcoin, other cryptocurrencies such as Litecoin, Ether and XRP are increasing their share.And at the end of 2017, just over 500 merchants accepted Dash, indicating growth of around 840%. By contrast, Coinmap data reveals that a little over 14,000 merchants, registered on this website, accepted Bitcoin on January 1 of this year, representing 25% growth from the previous year?ôs figure of 11,200. As of August 13, it has 15,257 venues registered in its database:There's also the growth of stablecoins to consider. As David Gold ??the CEO of blockchain interoperability firm Dapix ??explains, these have the obvious advantage of having a constant value, something which will attract mainstream users looking for a reliable way of paying for items online.Bitcoin may be able to achieve faster transactions and lower fees with the help of layer-two solutions like Lightning Network, he tells Cryptonews.com, but creating a more widespread perception of its stability will be difficult. ?úSo, stablecoins are likely the ones that will emerge as the near term winners in commerce.""Glen Goodman agrees, suspecting that one new stablecoin in particular will emerge as the frontrunner in the race to become the most popular coin for everyday transactions.""Cryptos are young and their prices have not yet settled down, so stablecoins are probably the best option for the near future,??he says. ?úFacebook already has an unparalleled global network to leverage with its Libra stablecoin.""That said, Goodman admits there's still a big question of whether ""the regulators and central banks actually allow [Libra] to launch,"" and assuming that they don't, other alternatives could rise to the surface.""Next-level infrastructure is being developed by fintech platforms such as COTI to allow companies to make their own stable coins with all the important features I've mentioned. So the future may consist of lots of different companies making their own cheaper, faster versions of PayPal based on stable-coin tech.""Of course, Libra hasn't even launched yet. Similarly, while a number of non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies are superior in terms of scalability, none are more stable as a store of value than Bitcoin, which as a result is arguably still the best crypto for payments.
""The transition from store of value to currency is something that has happened before and could very well happen again with Bitcoin,??explains David Gold. ""The transition from store of value to currency is something that has happened before and could very well happen again with Bitcoin,??explains David Gold. ?úAnd if volatility as a percentage of its value declines over time, the desire to hold it as an investment will not be as great, so people will be more open to using it in commerce.""Bitcoin?ôs volatility is already lower relative to many other cryptos, given that it lost ?òonly??80% of its USD 19,000 all-time high over the course of 2018, compared to 90% for Ethereum, for instance. Added to this, it's still accepted by the highest number of merchants and used most frequently in transactions, while its scalability is gradually improving.",,,,,,,

","The biggest smartphone maker Samsung has added Bitcoin support to its forthcoming Blockchain Keystore Software Development Kit (SDK) and confirmed that its cryptocurrency wallet is supported on its newest flagship phablet, Galaxy Note 10.","Per an update posted on the company?ôs site for developers, the SDK will also feature support for Kakao?ôs Klaytn ??providing compatibility for the Bitcoin, Ethereum and Klatyn blockchain platforms. This means apps developed using the kit will be capable of handling BTC, Ethereum, ERC20 and Klaytn?ôs Klay tokens. The post also gave details on the regional availability for the SDK. The kit will be restricted to the following nations: Canada, Germany, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland, the United States of America and the UK.The move means that millions of Samsung smartphone users will eventually be able to use Bitcoin with apps via the Blockchain Wallet that the company began including on its flagship devices, beginning with the Galaxy S10 earlier this year.As previously reported, the SDK is slated for release later this year, but the post states that a Beta version is already available for developers, although the company will screen application requests from would-be partners.

2,https://cryptonews.com/,Aug 11"," 2019""",How to Launch a Bitcoin ATM Business,https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/how-to-launch-a-bitcoin-atm-business-4421.htm,"Today, there are over 5,000 Bitcoin ATMs across the globe, according to 
Coin ATM Radar. From New York to Hong Kong, Moscow to London, ...","
August 11, 2019
","The Bitcoin ATM market is ?úmooning.??When the first Bitcoin ATM was installed in Vancouver, Canada in 2013, Bitcoin was still a largely unknown phenomenon. Fast forward to 2019, Bitcoin and Bitcoin ATMs are seemingly everywhere. ","Today, there are over 5,000 Bitcoin ATMs across the globe, according to Coin ATM Radar. From New York to Hong Kong, Moscow to London, and Buenos Aires to Sydney, you will find Bitcoin ATMs. Even the small African nation of Djibouti is home to a Bitcoin teller machine. The more bitcoin awareness and adoption grows, the more entrepreneurs are installing Bitcoin ATMs in an attempt to benefit from the ?ùbitcoin gold rush.?ùThe chart below shows net change of cryptocurrency machines number installed and removed monthly: In this guide, you will learn how you can launch a Bitcoin ATM business to jump onto this business opportunity, which is still risky as any other business idea. First and foremost, you will need to check what the legal and regulatory situation is in the country or state you want to run your operation. The legal framework for operating a bitcoin teller machine can differ significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and not complying with laws when it comes to cryptocurrencies is a surefire way to suffer serious legal consequences. Therefore, it is highly advisable to consult with a lawyer before launching a bitcoin business to ensure you will not end up on the wrong end of the law. Regardless of whether the Bitcoin ATMs you will install are one-way or two-way, you will need to handle cash as part of your day-to-day business operations. Therefore, you will need a business bank account at a bank that is willing to provide its services to a bitcoin business. Due to the threat that Bitcoin poses to the legacy banking systems, the majority of banks have been reluctant to bank Bitcoin startups. However, in most countries, you should be able to find a lender or a mobile-only banking provider that is willing to open an account for you.To play it safe, it would be advisable to set up more than one banking relationship due to the ever-changing regulatory landscape and to have a backup in case one institution changes its policy about servicing Bitcoin businesses. The setup costs for a Bitcoin ATM business can vary greatly, depending on what types and how many ATMs you decide to purchase to launch your venture. The prices of Bitcoin ATM range from USD 775 for a BitTeller BTM to USD 14,500 for a two-way Genesis Coin Genesis1 model. Delivery costs, installation costs, taxes, and import duties also need to be included in the setup costs as well as potential upfront rental charges for your chosen Bitcoin ATM location(s). Exchange integration is another important aspect of setting up a Bitcoin ATM (unless you want to use your own company/personal cryptocurrency wallets). However, exchanges generally do not charge an upfront fee as they receive execution fees on each trade. The purchase price of the machine(s) will be the largest portion of the setup costs while the remaining expenditure will range from a few hundred dollars to several thousand. Marketing expenses should also be taken into consideration as you will need to attract users to your ATM. Provided you choose one of the more affordable Bitcoin ATM models, your set-up costs could be as low as USD 5,000. On the high end, you could look at USD 20,000 to USD 25,000. The day-to-day management of a Bitcoin ATM business involves providing customer service to users who are having issues with the machine, doing cash runs to either restock the machine or to bring cash to the bank, ensuring everything runs smoothly with the exchange integration, prices feeds remain operational, and that the machine is running without glitches. A Bitcoin ATM business is, therefore, not one that can easily be run remotely. Either you or a trusted staff member will need to be on the ground to check on the machine(s), conduct maintenance if/when necessary, and conduct the cash management.The amount of profit you can generate per Bitcoin ATM will depend on factors such as the location, public interest, the level of customer support, the machine?ôs availability, and whether bitcoin is in bull or bear market. To get an idea of how much you can expect to earn, you can use the CoinATMRadar Bitcoin ATM ROI Calculator. The calculator enables you to input your known business costs, the ATM specifications, and your expected transaction volumes to compute an estimated ROI (Return on Investment) per machine. Let?ôs assume you purchase a General Bytes BATMTwo Classic for USD 3,249, and you expect your machine to process 300 transactions with an average transaction volume of USD 250 per month. You charge a 7% transaction fee, and the linked exchange charges a 0.2% trade execution fee. Finally, you pay USD 250 a month rental cost for the location of the ATM (in a caf√©, restaurant or a shop, for example) and you had one-off costs to start the business of USD 2,500. In this instance, you would generate USD 5,250 in revenue per month, which would equate to USD 4,850 in monthly profits and a payback period of only one month. This example shows that Bitcoin ATM businesses can be highly profitable if the right location is found, and enough users can be attracted. While this is only a theoretical example, the above returns mirror anecdotal evidence of Bitcoin ATM profitability found online. If you have the funds to launch such a venture and are located in a bitcoin-friendly jurisdiction, a Bitcoin ATM business may be an excellent entrance into the Bitcoin economy for entrepreneurs who are willing to take risks and, as a result, potentially receive a high monetary payoff. However, as with every business, there can be no guarantees.

August 12, 2019
","This past week, bitcoin price traded to a new monthly high close to USD 12,320 before starting a major downside correction. BTC/USD broke the key USD 11,800 and USD 11,500 support levels. It tested the USD 11,200 support area and is currently (08:00 UTC) correcting higher. However, upsides are likely to remain capped near USD 11,800 and USD 12,000. Similarly, there were extended losses in most major altcoins, including ethereum, ripple, EOS, litecoin, and bitcoin cash. ETH/USD tested the USD 200 support and it is currently correcting higher. XRP/USD broke the key USD 0.300 and USD 0.294 support levels. On the other hand, binance coin (BNB) settled above the key USD 30.00 resistance area.","Total market capitalization After testing the USD 11,200 support, bitcoin price  started an upside correction. BTC/USD corrected above USD 11,450 and USD 11,500, but it struggled to continue higher. The price is now trading below the USD 11,500 level, with an immediate support at USD 11,320. The main weekly support is near the USD 11,200, below which the price might decline towards USD 10,800.
On the upside, an immediate resistance is near the USD 11,500 level. However, the key weekly resistance is at USD 11,800. If there is a successful daily close above USD 11,800, the price could start a fresh increase towards USD 12,200 or USD 12,400.Ethereum price  declined heavily after it broke the USD 220 support level. ETH/USD tested the USD 200 support and it is currently correcting higher. The price is trading above USD 210, but the bulls seem to be facing a lot of hurdles near the USD 215 and USD 220 levels.
On the downside, the USD 210 support is an initial buy zone. The main weekly and monthly support is at USD 200, below which there is a risk of sharp losses in the near term.Bitcoin cash price  tested the key USD 310 support level and recently started a decent recovery. BCH/USD is currently up around 5% and it surpassed the USD 330 resistance. If there are more gains, the price could climb above the USD 340 resistance. The next key resistance is near the USD 355 level.
EOS  extended its decline below the USD 4.000 support level. The price tested the USD 3.800 support and recently recovered above USD 4.000. However, the USD 4.200 and USD 4.250 levels are major resistances and are likely to cap upsides in the short term.
Ripple price  is trading in a bearish zone below the USD 0.305 and USD 0.312 resistance levels. On the downside, XRP/USD might continue to find bids near the USD 0.292 level. However, if there is a downside break below USD 0.292, there are chances of more losses in the near term towards USD 0.285 and USD 0.272.In the past three sessions, a few small cap altcoins advanced more than 5%, including MXM, EKT, WIX, XIN, QNT and XVG. On the other hand, JCT, CRO, ABBC, NEX and EGT declined more than 5%.Overall, bitcoin price seems to have started a downside correction below USD 11,800 and USD 11,500. Unless it climbs back above USD 11,800, there is a risk of more downsides towards USD 11,000 and USD 10,800 in the coming sessions.

",China?ôs central bank has revealed details of a plan to issue a blockchain-powered digital fiat ??and appears to be assembling a host of resources and personnel to speed up the process.,"Per a report from Beijing Business Today (republished by Shina), the deputy director of the People?ôs Bank of China (PBoC)?ôs Payment and Settlement Department, Mu Chang Chun, has confirmed that the bank has been working on releasing a digital fiat since 2014, and is now ?úready??to roll the currency out. The newspaper also says it has discovered the central bank is actively recruiting talent and acquiring or investing in blockchain technology firms in the country ??perhaps preparing the ground for a forthcoming launch.However, it looks like the central bank wants to be as hands-on as possible with its new fiat. Mu spoke of a ?útwo-tier system,??whereby the PBoC issues tokens to commercial banks and other financial institutions in the country, who then distribute them for public use. Mu said this was very different from a ?úsingle-tier??system, whereby the central bank released tokens directly to the public.Using commercial banks as an intermediary, he stated, would help reduce any risk involved in the project. He also added that the PBoC?ôs goal with the project was to radically change the existing money supply models banks currently use to cut down on waste and money laundering.The report also states that ?úexternal factors??have provided a reason for the PBoC to ?úwork overtime??on the development of its new digital currency in the past year ??with tens of blockchain and digital currency patents filed within the space of the past 12 months.The same media outlet reports that a central bank-funded subsidiary named Shenzhen Financial Technology appears to be particularly active. The company last week posted job ads for 31 blockchain researchers and engineers, offering salaries some 20%-30% higher than average for blockchain specialists in mainland China. The company also appears to have made investments in fintech enterprises located around the country.Meanwhile, as reported, Beijing is possibly slowly starting to rethink its policy towards cryptocurrency as The Bank of China, one of the four biggest state-owned commercial banks (not the be confused with the PBoC), has released an overall positive infographic that explains what Bitcoin is, how it is used and what causes Bitcoin price fluctuations. Moreover, Chinese tech giants like gaming firm Tencent and e-commerce platform Alibaba are reportedly waiting in the wings, ready to help authorities work on blockchain-powered tokens.

","The UK-based branch of popular American crypto exchange Coinbase is de-listing Zcash (ZEC) from its trading platform, an email sent out to clients late last week revealed. ","According to the email, the privacy-focused cryptocurrency will be removed effective August 26, 2019. All clients are asked to either sell or convert their ZEC holding to another supported asset by that date. Failure to do so will lead to any remaining ZEC being automatically liquidated to British Pounds, the update said.Some Coinbase clients have also posted screenshots of the email they received on Twitter:@zcash @ElectricCoinCo @coinbase what's going on with Zcash in the UK? https://t.co/6GWS9CuIoHIt is not known what the reason for the sudden removal of Zcash from the UK-based exchange is, but some speculate that it could be due to pressure from the British authorities. According to media reports, the UK tax authority HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) have asked several crypto exchanges operating in the UK for customer and transaction data.The exchanges that have received letters from the HMRC demanding information include Coinbase, eToro, and CEX.IO. And as Coinbase may have experienced, obtaining accurate transaction data ??especially for transactions occurring outside of the exchange ??may prove difficult with privacy-focused coins like Zcash.However, Electric Coin Company, the firm behind Zcash, insists that the privacy coin is compliant, tweeting on Saturday that Zcash is ??00% compatible??with UK know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) regulations. The team also pointed out that UK residents can still buy Zcash on other exchanges, including CEX.IO.Those affected by @coinbase UK issues: this is limited to Coinbase UK only. UK residents can still buy/sell Zcash t??https://t.co/7Kp9567Ll0In a comment posted to Twitter on Sunday, Zooko Wilcox, CEO of Electric Coin Company, suggested to ask Coinbase what was the reason to delist this token. He once again stressed that ?úthe reason *isn't* any incompatibility between Zcash and the UK AML/KYC laws and [regulations].?ù‚ÄúThe narrative of ""governments are cracking down on privacy"" is so strong ??maybe because it has an aura of conflict and drama ??that it continues to spread in spite of the facts,??he added.Coinbase was not available for immediate comment.Zcash being delisted from Coinbase UK is a troubling sign.

(Updated on 16:13 UTC: updates throughout the entire text, in bold.)","""With DeversiFi now able to compete with existing centralized exchanges, we are closing down Ethfinex.com and revamping the Nectar (NEC) token as we  transition towards full decentralization,"" Will Harborne, CEO of DeversiFi, said in a blog post.Ethfinex Trustless, the hybrid Ethereum exchange platform launched by Bitfinex in mid-2018, becomes DeversiFi today, while Ethfinex.com, the centralized platform that was launched in 2017, to be closed next month. ""Traders of Ethfinex Centralized will be able to trade on DeversiFi by withdrawing their tokens to a privately owned wallet. Users who do not wish to withdraw their funds from Ethfinex Centralized will automatically be moved to Bitfinex once Ethfinex Centralized closes its doors in September 2019,"" the company said in a press release. Harborne told Cryptonews.com that the centralized platform has ""tens of thousands of monthly active traders, whereas DeversiFi (the new Ethfinex Trustless) has several hundred dedicated users that have helped us improve and iterate the product over the past six months."" According to the CEO, they see the new platform ""as a necessary next step forward towards our goal of empowering traders through fast convenient and self-managed decentralized financial technology.??The platform claims that it is a ""high-speed decentralized exchange where traders can execute orders of any size directly from the security of their private wallet, whilst accessing the liquidity of large existing exchanges.""The company said it will launch new products and features, such as decentralized margin trading and lending, as well as invest in decentralized exchange technology, ""to better serve the needs of the rapidly growing DeFi community.""

The settlement is decentralized on the Ethereum blockchain. What makes it a hybrid DEX is that the order-books and matching are centralized. The user simply locks their ERC20 tokens into a smart contract and can then execute by simply signing a transaction - matching the speed of a centralized exchange whilst maintaining control of their funds until the trade is executed. We think that this approach is ?òthe best of both worlds??"" Harborne told Cryptonews.com.
