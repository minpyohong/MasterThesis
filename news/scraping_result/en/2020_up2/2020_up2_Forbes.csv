","The bitcoin halving will seen the number of tokens rewarded to those that maintain the bitcoin network, called miners, cut by half on May 12—with analysts divided over exactly how it will affect the bitcoin price. However, technical data and sentiment signals are suggesting the bitcoin price could soon make a major move.The bitcoin price has climbed over recent weeks, with many bitcoin traders and investors confident ... [+] the bitcoin rally will continue. ""The bitcoin halving is only five days away and in the lead up to this event, we’re seeing a lot of people speculating on what will happen, whether the price will go up or down, or if it will be a non-event,"" said Danny Scott, chief executive of U.K.-based bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchange CoinCorner, comparing the bitcoin halving to the build up to New Year’s Eve celebrations and warning people not to ""focus on short-term price movements.""""There’s typically a big build up to the night itself, but the event is technically over as soon as midnight strikes—this is a similar situation for the halving.""CoinCorner, along with many other bitcoin exchanges around the world, has recorded an increase in new users signing up over recent months. ""We’ve actually seen a 21% increase in sign ups during April (from the previous month) which adds to this year's strong growth in the build up to the halving,"" Scott added. Elsewhere, the London-based bitcoin exchange Luno claims it will hit 4 million users in coming days—most of whom (75%) expect the bitcoin price to be ""higher"" or ""much higher"" by the end of 2020 according to a recent user survey.Less than 5% of Luno users said they plan to sell their bitcoin over the next six months, with more than 90% expecting to buy more, increase trading or hold on to their crypto over the same period of time. Luno's chief executive, Marcus Swanepoel, is also upbeat—predicting that bitcoin will return to its all-time highs ""in the next 12 to 18 months.""""I believe we’re currently at the beginning of a long upward trend, one that, considering the broader economic environment, is set to experience increased volatility, especially in the next few weeks,"" said Swanepoel. ""Nevertheless, with the halving just around the corner, and with some applied patience, we will see that same sharp increase common with previous halvings, even if it will take a bit longer that usual to get there.""Meanwhile, bitcoin's hash rate, a measure of the computing power being directed at the bitcoin network, has climbed to a fresh all-time high over the past week as miners try to squeeze as many bitcoin from the network as possible before the halving. On May 3, the one-day average mining hash rate of the bitcoin blockchain reached 139 exahashes per second, according to data compiled by blockchain analysis firm Glassnode.Bitcoin's network strength has climbed much more consistently than the bitcoin price over recent ... [+] years. ""The hash rate measures how much computer processing power is being put to work at any one time by the whole of the bitcoin network, and it always rises and falls in reaction to miners’ contributions to the network,"" said Adam Vettese, market analyst at brokerage eToro, adding this is bitcoin miners' ""last hurrah"" before the halving. The wider bitcoin and cryptocurrency industry is also cheering the coming bitcoin halving, hoping it will bring with it new users and potential sales. ""While we don’t know how the upcoming halving will affect the price of bitcoin, we do know that investments are pouring into the institutional market and more individuals are investing in bitcoin than ever before,"" said Pascal Gauthier, chief executive of Ledger, a producer of bitcoin and cryptocurrency hardware wallets. ""The crypto market continues to climb, in a trend very similar to what we saw pre-halving in 2016."""

[+] bitcoin will continue to climb through May. ""We think it is likely the [bitcoin] price will go above $10,000 before the halving actually takes place,"" said Simon Peters, bitcoin and cryptocurrency analyst at brokerage eToro, pointing to ""a frenzy of activity among bullish investors.""""While the halving itself was always likely to drive the price up, the bitcoin bulls have decided not to wait around and are positioning themselves well ahead of time,"" Peters added. In just ten days time, the number of bitcoin rewarded to those that maintain the bitcoin network, known as miners, will be halved for the third time, dropping from 12.5 bitcoin per block to 6.25.Bitcoin halvings are scheduled to continue roughly once every four years until the maximum supply of 21 million bitcoins has been generated by the network—something that isn't expected to happen until well into the next century.Peters also named a number of ""tailwinds"" that could push up the bitcoin price over the next couple of weeks, including miners holding on to their newly-created bitcoin, new users buying bitcoin, and fear of inflation driving people toward crypto. ""As for how high it can go longer term, amid the deteriorating economic outlook for the U.S. economy and the likelihood of an ever increasing monetary supply, which weakens the U.S. dollar and stokes inflation fears, we believe it could easily test previous highs above $19,000 as investors look for safe-havens away from traditional assets,"" Peters said.The bitcoin price has soared over the last month, topping $9,000 this week before falling back ... [+] slightly. While previous halvings have heralded bitcoin price booms, the price hasn't necessarily climbed in the run up to them. ""In 2016, I didn’t participate in the halving and all things considered, it was a minor event. The real rally happened 18 months later,"" said Catherine Coley, chief executive of BinanceUS, part of the world's largest bitcoin and crypto exchange by volume, Binance, adding she's ""bullish"" on bitcoin long term.The year after the 2016 bitcoin halving, the bitcoin price soared from under $1,000 per bitcoin to around $20,000 in less than 12 months. Meanwhile, BinanceUS has reported a surge of new users in recent weeks as the Federal Reserve goes to never-before-seen lengths to prop up the economy, which has been ravaged by coronavirus-induced lockdowns. ""With unemployment and stimulus funding flooding [the] system, I think more people are looking for an alternative exposure to a market that's unrelated to [the U.S. dollar],"" Coley said."

Bitcoin leaped higher on Wednesday morning, nudging $9,000 per bitcoin before falling back to trade around $8,800 on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchange. ""Bitcoin is now trading at a critical inflexion point, where significant Fibonacci retracements, 50-day moving averages and 10-day moving averages converge on the daily chart,"" analysts at Singapore-based bitcoin index fund Stack wrote in a note, adding the turning of this resistance to support could see ""further price action upside towards $9,300"" but cautioned potential investors over ""short-term headwinds.""Bitcoin traders and investors are feeling upbeat as wider markets stage an incredible recovery despite most coronavirus-induced lockdowns still in place around the world. U.S. stocks closed higher on Wednesday, adding to previous gains, as investor optimism over a potential coronavirus treatment grew, some lockdowns were eased, and Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell said he is willing to go further to prop up the economy ravaged by lockdowns. ""It may well be the case that the economy needs more support,"" Powell said, speaking at a press conference after the Fed's two-day policy meeting.The Fed's dovish stance has significantly boosted the bitcoin price, as well as most other assets, though crypto market watchers have pointed to strong underlying bitcoin sentiment for its outsized performance.

""We are seeing some enthusiasm around bitcoin as it breaks $8,000, but we are still watching closely and believe the sentiment is not yet bullish,"" said Meltem Demirors, chief strategy officer at London-based digital asset manager CoinShares, warning over ""conflicting outlooks"" on what a broad economic recovery looks like.

Shortly before bitcoin's 20% rally this week, a large transfer of the stablecoin tether was made to bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchange Binance. Tether is a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar on a one-to-one basis with its creators claiming they keep one U.S. dollar in reserve for every tether token issued.Tether tokens worth a little over $50 million were transferred to Malta-based Binance early on Wednesday, just hours before bitcoin began its $30 billion pump. A Twitter bot that records major bitcoin and cryptocurrency trades, called Whale Alert, picked up the transaction. Over the past month Tether Ltd, which controls the stablecoin tether and shares owners and senior staff with the British Virgin Islands-based bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex, has ramped up the number of tether it's creating—minting over $1 billion worth of the stablecoin. ""[On Wednesday we] witnessed extensive buying activity and the high level of scalability and liquidity evident on our platform made us able to seamlessly service all these requests,"" boasted Bitfinex chief technology officer, Paolo Ardoino—who also serves as the chief technology officer of Tether—in a statement that pointed to major U.S. bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase's unfortunate outage during the sudden bitcoin rally.The bitcoin suddenly shot higher earlier this week--catching many traders and investors off-guard ...

""Economists are dealing with three levels of uncertainty,"" UBS chief economist Paul Donovan wrote in his daily update. ""Uncertainty about the virus. Uncertainty about the policy response. Uncertainty about the economic response to the virus and to policy.

Some think bitcoin could cement its status as a so-called safe-haven asset as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with investors buying bitcoin in times of uncertainty alongside gold. ""If quantitative easing causes an uptick in inflation, we could see bitcoin being increasingly used as a hedge against global instability, which will have a significant positive impact on its performance,"" said Gavin Smith, chief executive of Panxora Group, a consortium of cryptocurrency companies that includes a hedge fund and a cryptocurrency exchange.""However, it is far from being a magic money tree—we certainly aren't free of price swings and volatility, so while there will likely be an uphill trend in price, investors should still proceed with caution."""

(AP Photo/Kiichiro Sato)","The Bitcoin price increased by 22 percent in merely two days, catching major investors in the cryptocurrency market off guard. It surged past several key historical resistance levels to peak above $9,400. But, BTC now faces a reversal in the short-term as large Bitcoin holders look to take profit from the recent rally.According to a cryptocurrency options trader known as ""Theta Seek,"" several over-the-counter (OTC) desks saw record high levels of sell-off as the Bitcoin price hovered over $9,000.When BTC initially increased above $8,000, it broke its 200-day simple moving average (SMA), 200-day exponential moving average (EMA), and the 0.618 Fibonacci level calculated in between $3,600 and $14,000. These three levels are considered as the most crucial levels in technical analysis, especially in evaluating long-term trends.As Bitcoin rapidly broke out of the $8,000 region onto the $9,000s, data shows that investors rushed to sell the dominant cryptocurrency in the $9,000 to $9,400 range.""Spoke to a couple of OTC desks and heard that there were record amounts of BTC being sold at above 9K,."" the trader said.The abrupt upsurge of sell orders in the OTC market coincided with stacking sell orders on the OKEx futures exchange. OKEx is one of the two exchanges alongside Huobi that formed a relationship with the government of China to facilitate trades for Chinese investors.Bitcoin researcher Nik Yaremchuk shared the orderbook of OKEx on top of the price chart of Bitcoin, and it showed significant selling pressure above $9,000.Bitcoin orderbook on OKEx shows stacked sell ordersBased on market data from Skew, OKEx now has the highest open interest for Bitcoin futures in the global market at $710 million, as it overtook BitMEX. As such, the selling pressure coming from OKEx can have a strong effect on the short-term price trend of BTC.One variable that could sustain the momentum of Bitcoin in the upcoming two weeks approaching the block reward halving is all-time high volume on top spot exchanges.Binance, Coinbase, and several other leading spot platforms saw record breaking volumes in the last three days. It led to the theory that the recent Bitcoin price spike was primarily triggered by actual demand from retail investors rather than spoof orders in the futures market.Daily Bitcoin spot exchange volume verified by Bitwise Asset ManagementWhen a Bitcoin rally is triggered off of highly leveraged trades in the futures market, it leaves BTC susceptible to a severe correction in the near-term. In October 2019 and February 2020, as an example, the Bitcoin price fell from $10,500 to $6,400 within a month after surpassing $10,000.Accumulation of BTC in the spot exchange market strengthens the fundamental basis of an extended Bitcoin recovery. It reduces the risk of a steep downtrend in the intermediate-term and wild price swings in the short-term."

The cryptocurrency rose to as much as $8,973.08 this afternoon, CoinDesk figures show. At this price, the digital asset had reached its highest level since early March, and was up more 16.2% over approximately 24 hours, additional CoinDesk data reveals.[Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.]When explaining this recent price action, several analysts pointed to technical factors and anticipation surrounding the so-called halving, which will reduce new supply of bitcoin by 50%. Denis Vinokourov, head of research for London-based digital asset firm Bequant, weighed in on these matters. “With less than two weeks before the eagerly awaited block reward halving, the market was poised for a breakout,” he stated.“The direction was not always clear and, with plenty of flow in the derivatives market that would imply market participants were looking for downside protection, as opposed to upside exposure, there was always a risk of a retracement,” said Vinokourov. However, the situation looks more straightforward at this point, he claimed. ‘The Bulls Have Prevailed’“At this stage, it appears that the bulls have prevailed, with key technical levels broken in the process,” said Vinokourov. Joe DiPasquale, CEO of cryptocurrency hedge fund manager BitBull Capital, offered some clarity on this matter, emphasizing that bitcoin’s “price was testing the 150-day moving average for the past week and finally broke through it today, breaching the resistance at $8,200.” “Moving forward, the next resistance lies between $8,700 and $9,000,” he stated, adding that “Bitcoin is likely to consolidate and retest $8,000 as a support before trying to tackle those.”‘A Critical Juncture’The markets have encountered ‘a critical juncture’ after bitcoin bounced back, recovering from the sharp declines it suffered in recent months, said Michael Collett, cofounder and chief marketing officer of digital asset management platform Stack. “Should bears refrain from putting up much resistance to current movements, and dedicate themselves long term to their holdings, we can expect to see further price action upside as anticipation of the halving triggers bulls who see this as an opportunity to buy BTC at bargain basement rates before a price pop post halving,” he stated. “Currently trending towards the $9,000 mark, despite sitting below $8,000 less than 24 hours ago — we may be about to see BTC further compound its tremendous gains as it outperformed the S&P 500, SSE Index, and Nikkei and even gold in YTD terms based on its performance already this week,” Collett added. “Set against the broader context of excessive monetary easing policies and ‘unlimited’ economic stimuli in major economies, these gains are likely just the beginning,” he predicted. “Current monetary policies should only benefit bitcoin in the long term as fiat currencies will undoubtedly weaken as a result.”Disclosure: I own some bitcoin, bitcoin cash, litecoin, ether and EOS.

Bitcoin has been thrust into the limelight by the coronavirus pandemic and the extraordinary ... [+] emergency measures put in place to prevent its spread. The bitcoin price has remained flat for the year, however, some smaller crypto rivals are soaring. Stellar, which falls just outside of the cryptocurrency top ten tokens by value, as measured by Binance-owned crypto data website CoinMarketCap, has doubled since its March lows. Bitcoin and the wider cryptocurrency market, including stellar, crashed last month as the coronavirus pandemic brought the world economy to its knees. Bitcoin has, meanwhile, added around 70% since the crash but has failed to recapture its momentum from earlier in the year. The exact cause for stellar's sudden surge, which has seen the XLM price climb by around 40% in just the last seven days, was not immediately clear, however, some have pointed to positive buzz as potentially pushing up the price. ""Stellar has continued its phenomenal month of April with social dominance and social volume continuing to surge as the crowd figures out whether its run can continue,"" crypto-analytics platform Santiment said via Twitter.The stellar price has soared over the last week, adding some 40% and taking its year-to-date gains ... [+] to around 75%.Meanwhile, investors around the world are looking forward to a post-coronavirus economy and betting cryptocurrencies could come out ahead. ""Cryptocurrencies will likely be just as vulnerable to global threats as other assets of any kind,"" said Alex Kuptsikevich, senior financial analyst at FxPro. ""However, the difference may lie in the future. After all, some assets may lose their buyers forever, while others will build a new structure on the ruins. In the new economy, there will be a much larger space for purely digital projects."""

The world’s most prominent digital currency was driven higher by “a perfect storm,” according to market analyst Denis Vinokourov. “A combination of positive network fundamentals in the form of mining difficulty adjustment and a strong showing by the hashrate since correcting lower in March, together with technical price formation above 50DMA and aggressive stop loss hunting through $7,500, sent Bitcoin soaring all the way to $7,800 level,” said Vinokourov, head of research for London-based digital asset firm Bequant. Other market observers agreed, noting that multiple price drivers helped fuel bitcoin’s gains. [Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.]As a result of these developments, the digital asset climbed from $7,165.22 at roughly 9:30 a.m. EDT to $7,725.67 around 10:20 a.m., a gain of 7.8%, CoinDesk figures show. Since that time, bitcoin has been trading mostly between $7,500 and $7,600, additional CoinDesk data reveals. Going forward, the digital currency could be headed for additional gains, noted Vinokourov, who highlighted specific market factors. “Futures contracts trading at a premium to spot prices (known as contango) supports the notion of further upside,” said Vinokourov. Kiana Danial, CEO of Invest Diva, supported this optimistic assessment with some technical analysis. “Bitcoin has just broken above the daily Ichimoku cloud, with the future cloud turned bullish,” she stated. While Danial described this as “a bullish indication,” she noted that “we could see a temporary pullback in the coming days as it has already hit the resistance level of $7,746 which falls on the 38% Fibonacci retracement level.”“From there, as the Ichimoku cloud continues to act as a support, we could see further gains above $8,000 towards the end of the month.” Joe DiPasquale, CEO of cryptocurrency hedge fund manager BitBull Capital, also weighed in. “We saw BTC’s price finding support at the 50-day moving average for the last three days, which gave it the confidence needed to breach the resistance at $7,300 and almost test the 150-day moving average resistance today, which currently stands at roughly $7,800,” he stated. “Moving forward, however, it is likely that we will see a pullback towards $7,300 - $7,200 and consolidation in this range before Bitcoin can rise above the 150-day moving average, which can pave the way” for a push toward $9,000.

""It was a team of eleven people over a period of five years, that came up, eventually, with [bitcoin],"" McAfee told bitcoin and cryptocurrency website Cointelegraph on the virtual sidelines of a now digital blockchain conference, forced online due to the coronavirus pandemic, adding he thinks Craig Wright, a computer scientist who's repeatedly claimed to be bitcoin's creator but failed to produce proof, was involved.

In 2014, the U.S. magazine Newsweek claimed a Japanese American man living in California, Dorian Prentice Satoshi Nakamoto, was the bitcoin inventor. A claim he subsequently denied and one that has now been widely disregarded. Others, such as cryptographic pioneer and the first person to receive a bitcoin transaction, Hal Finney, have been named as possibilities. Forbes put that question to Finney in the months before he died. Bit gold creator Nick Szabo and bitcoin developer Gavin Andresen have also been linked to the name Satoshi Nakamoto."

TSLA
 and Bitcoin may appear to be completely different technologies with distinct users, use cases, and investors. Tesla is the amalgamation of car manufacturing, alternative energy, computer software, and artificial intelligence. The company plans on combining these disciplines to launch a fleet of autonomous robotaxis in the not too distant future. Bitcoin is a decentralized asset promising to reboot the global financial and monetary system. In short, Tesla is revolutionizing transportation and energy, whilst Bitcoin is revolutionizing money and finance. Tesla has an enigmatic, polarizing, charismatic leader in Elon Musk who is often prone to gaffs. However, Bitcoin derives much of its value from having no leading figure or central point of failure.  Despite these obvious differences, the two assets have been amongst the best performing assets this year, often moving together in lockstep. At time of writing, Tesla has appreciated 72% and Bitcoin 23% year-to-date, compared to a decline of 13% for the S&P 500 year-to-date. In order to quantify the relationship between Tesla and Bitcoin, I analyzed the price movements of the two assets in relation to the S&P 500 over the last three and a half years. I calculated the daily percentage price changes over this time period and then indexed them starting at 100 to visualize the performance of each asset, shown below.Indexed price movements of Bitcoin, Tesla, and the S&P 500 from 2017 until now. Bitcoin shown in ... [+] blue, Tesla in orange, and the S&P in gray. Interestingly, the highest price correlation between Bitcoin and Tesla was in the last six months during the period of October 2019 to April 2020.Zooming in on the last six months of indexed price movements for Bitcoin, Tesla, and the S&P 500. ... [+] Tesla and Bitcoin price correlations can be easily visualized. As a quick primer, correlation is a statistic that measures the degree to which two random variables move in relation to each other. The correlation coefficient has a value between -1 and +1, with 1 implying a perfect positive correlation (i.e. the two assets move perfectly together) and -1 implying a perfect negative correlation (i.e. the two assets move perfectly in opposite directions). Caveat: correlation does not equal causation, and many false correlations do exist. However, correlation can be a decent measurement to help identify when relationships between two assets may exist.   Comparing the price correlations of Bitcoin, Tesla, and the S&P 500 in the last six months yielded the following results:Matrix displaying the price correlations between Bitcoin, Tesla, and the S&P 500 over the last six ... [+] months. Bitcoin and Tesla clearly have stronger price correlation than with the S&P 500. Thus, Tesla and Bitcoin exhibited strong correlation of 0.615 over the last six months, significantly higher than both of their correlations with the S&P 500. One explanation for this high correlation may be that the investor base is similar for both assets. Advocates of Tesla and Bitcoin share a common set of values. Beyond technophiles who believe technology can solve many of society’s pressing problems, Bitcoin and Tesla holders are optimists who believe in narratives of a sustainable future powered by alternative energy and sound money. Proponents of both believe in the ethos of open source technology. Bitcoin is an open source protocol anyone with an internet connection can access. Similarly, in 2014, Elon Musk famously released all of Tesla’s patents to the public “in the spirit of the open source movement.”Retail investors make up a large portion of both Bitcoin and Tesla holders. Whereas institutions own approximately 80% of the broader equity market, institutions own only 52.8% of Tesla stock. Note, this is not a perfect comparison as some of these institutional investors represent ETFs and funds managed on behalf of retail investors. Similarly, Bitcoin started as a grassroots movement of cypherpunks and grew as it was adopted by libertarians, speculators, and the larger global retail investor base. Although institutional investors are starting to trickle into the crypto markets, retail investors will always serve as its foundation of users and holders. Taken a step further, a significant percentage of Bitcoin and Tesla investors are “HODLers” (‘Hold On for Dear Life’). These investors believe so deeply in the underlying technology and its societal impact that they will hold the asset no matter how low it dips in the throes of a bear market. Both Tesla and Bitcoin are no stranger to 50%+ dips, which are often accumulated by long term holders with high conviction.  Furthermore, millennials seem to be piling into both Tesla and Bitcoin. A survey by Schwab found that Tesla and Bitcoin were in the top five of all equity holdings for millennials. According to a survey by Schwab, Tesla and Bitcoin are both within the top 5 equity holdings of ... [+] millennials. Despite the positive price action for both Bitcoin and Tesla, there are concerns that neither asset is currently appropriately valued and may be experiencing speculative bubbles. Both assets present unique risks as they combat determined incumbent players. In the automotive industry, the likes of GM, Ford, Toyota, Honda, and Audi are rolling out their own electric vehicle initiatives, and Bitcoin will fight legacy financial services and banking institutions comprising ~20% of total U.S. GDP. As Bitcoin and Tesla continue to gain market share, bigger wars with incumbents will ensue. Tesla and Bitcoin will continue to be volatile assets largely driven by retail sentiment. However, at their best, they represent society’s ambitions to use technology and entrepreneurship to solve its biggest issues today and in the future."

Now, some influential members of the bitcoin and crypto community have complained Twitter has ""shadow-banned"" them, limiting their reach and impressions. Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey has praised bitcoin and cryptocurrencies but has previously ... [+] admitted Twitter needs to improve its algorithm. ""They’re doing it, people,"" tech investor and founder of bitcoin and cryptocurrency news and analysis website The Block, Mike Dudas, said. ""Crypto Twitter has been shadow-banned. I’ve noticed this on my account this week.""Dudas was commenting on a complaint made by crypto developer Anthony Sassano who said: ""Any tweets that I post get way less impressions than normal.""""I think [Twitter] limited tweet reach [and] impressions,"" said Neeraj Agrawal of Washington D.C.-based cryptocurrency policy think tank Coin Center.""I started using LinkedIn again out of desperation,"" added partner at blockchain-focused venture capital fund, Castle Island Ventures, Nic Carter. Twitter has yet to respond to a request for comment.Twitter, just like most big technology platforms, regularly tinkers with its algorithm and it's possible that in an attempt to crack down on bitcoin and crypto scams, authentic accounts have been targeted. The reports of shadow-banning come as the bitcoin community gears up to one of the biggest events in its 10-year history. On May 12, the number of bitcoin rewarded to those that maintain the bitcoin network, known as miners, will be halved for the third time, dropping from 12.5 bitcoin per block to 6.25.It's unclear how the looming supply squeeze will impact the price of bitcoin, however, many expect bitcoin and crypto trading volume to spike in the run up to May 12—with a surge of media attention potentially pushing up the bitcoin price.This week, the bitcoin price has soared almost 20%, making it one of the best performing assets so far this year. Meanwhile, Twitter is embroiled in an internal battle that could see it drastically change how it deals with some of its most influential users, including U.S. president Donald Trump. Earlier this year, Twitter was rocked by news the powerful Wall Street activist investor Elliott Management has bought $1 billion worth of Twitter stock and is working to oust co-founder Jack Dorsey from the company he helped build.Dorsey, one of the tech world's biggest bitcoin cheerleaders, has spoken highly of bitcoin, crypto and blockchain technology—going so far as to create a crypto division of his payments company Square to work on bitcoin development full-time.Dorsey's Twitter bio currently reads, simply: #bitcoinThe bitcoin price has soared this year, boosted by excitement around the looming halving event and ... [+] global efforts to shore up the economy ravaged by coronavirus lockdowns. Dorsey's growing interest in bitcoin and cryptocurrencies has, however, caused him problems.Dorsey attracted criticism from Twitter and Square investors last year when he promised to spend from three to six months in Africa to explore cryptocurrency opportunities in 2020. He has since cancelled the trip due to the coronavirus pandemic. Silicon Valley's fraught relationship with bitcoin and cryptocurrencies has deteriorated in recent years as some of the world's biggest technology companies increasingly look toward financial services to bolster advertising revenue. Toward the end of last year, Google sparked an ongoing war with the bitcoin and cryptocurrency community by removing many bitcoin and cryptocurrency videos from its video-sharing site YouTube in what was branded a ""crypto-purge.""YouTube was quick to reverse most of the video removals, claiming they were made in error, however, crypto content has reportedly been targeted by attempts to limit the spread of false information amid the coronavirus pandemic."

The bitcoin “halvening” should be such a repeat event.For the uninitiated, the halvening is a cryptocurrency event when the printing of new coins slows by half. Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin give a reward to members of the blockchain administrating network, called miners, when they crack the permission puzzle and are allowed to make the next transaction update post to the blockchain ledger. That reward is currently about $100,000 of bitcoin depending on the value of bitcoin at the time. This reward is about to halve. The process is convoluted but that’s crypto for you.So on May 11 or thereabouts, the issuance of bitcoin will drop from 12.5 coins to 6.25 coins every ten minutes.Most people see this as a big positive as now every day, 12.5 x 6 x 24 bitcoins are issued, $16 million worth, which have to be absorbed one way or another by new money buying bitcoin. After the halvening that issuance of new coins will halve. Lower new supply and unchanged new demand should push the price up. If the money influx remains constant, the price will rise to the point where existing bitcoin owners want to sell. These new sellers are notoriously greedy hoarders, so as such the new equilibrium point should be a lot higher.This is what happened last time:The Bitcoin chart shows what happened when the last halvening took placeThis post-halvening move, while eye-watering enough, was just the beginning, the price then rose to $20,000 before the famous bitcoin crash.Before the last halvening this happened:Here's what happened before the last halveningAnd right now this is going on:The current Bitcoin chartThere are clear parallels in these charts but also obvious differences and without doubt they are driven by the coronavirus crash. The halvening is bullish for sure, but the virus and its fallout trumps all other factors.There is a major fork in the economic road ahead. Is it deflation or inflation? Market practitioners like myself say “Inflation, Inflation!” but economists say “Deflation you idiots.” Seems that one party is wrong.So let’s look at the drivers for crypto:1) Fiat inflation/deflation: Digital gold like bitcoin will love inflation. Deflation not so much.2) Global financial liquidity: If money is tight all assets take a dive because cash is king. The opposite is good for crypto.3) Global “OMG/WTF:” Bitcoin loves trade wars, sabre rattling, anything that will make people buy bitcoin to move, hide, travel with or protect their wealth.So we currently have the halvening, a new round of Chinese devaluation/trade war/Trump tweetstorm happening, a large number of people ready for very high inflation, an unresolved global lockdown dynamic, huge uncertainty on the outcome of global bailouts, and the rolling impact of various preventative actions and then the path of the virus itself. It is no surprise then that bitcoin is rallying. Long term it will be the outcome of the inflation/deflation paradox that affects bitcoin the most. The no-inflation future depends on maintaining the vast subterranean wells of money that are inertly trapped by their owners’ inertia, underground. There are trillions of dollars of near cash parked at zero interest. If these new trillions end up sequestered with the rest then there will be deflation, if they are forced to break surface into the economy then there will inflation.The central banks will have to do an incredible balancing act to pull off a mid-course and they will be repurposing the QE of the global financial crisis of 2008 to do it, even though the configuration of this emergency is completely different.For me the decision that will happen boils down to Alien versus Predator, or in this case, theorists vs. practitioners. Many of the hedge funds’ top minds see the fires of inflation soon to be licking around our feet, the economists floating in their UFOs above us see deflation and a repeat of 2009 onwards where purely technical maneuvers can solve another financial emergency.I feel I want to throw in my hat with the hedge fund types who see that these vast stimulus packages must create inflation because as the scale of money shifts from billions to trillions I can’t see how transmission cannot ultimately hit the value of money. More money and lower prices can only happen if there is more stuff and it’s stuff that is not getting made that is the core problem. The “sold out” signs on the internet bullion sites is the canary in the coal mine to me. If we get a pick up in inflation, bitcoin’s price will become unhinged. As such I keep buying. ——Clem Chambers is the CEO of private investors website ADVFN.com and author of 101 Ways to Pick Stock Market Winners and Trading Cryptocurrencies: A Beginner’s Guide.

Within the span of merely two days, the cryptocurrency gained over 20%, peaking just above $9,500. It was a move that liquidated dozens of millions worth of futures positions on BitMEX, data from Skew.com shows.According to Mohit Sorout, partner at cryptocurrency hedge fund Bitazu Capital, what drove the rally was an influx of buying activity on spot cryptocurrency exchanges such as Coinbase, not buying activity on derivatives platforms. Spot exchanges differ from derivatives platforms in that they facilitate crypto to fiat trades without borrowed capital, unlike futures exchanges, which allow their users to utilize leverage.Sorout found that as Bitcoin pressed higher, the open interest on BitMEX hit a “new all-time low,” reaching 50,000 BTC. Prior to March’s crash to $3,700, BitMEX’s open interest was closer to 100,000 BTC, according to Skew.com. This metric reaching an all-time low is significant because it suggests that the speculative contracts, the futures, “no longer dominate the price of Bitcoin,” Sorout explained. Instead, it was spot markets that were “leading this uptrend.” The trader also found that as BitMEX’s open interest plunged, the price of BTC on Coinbase and on BitMEX continued to deviate from one another, creating a positive basis indicative of consistent buy-side pressure in the spot markets. Corroborating this is Bitwise’s trading volume dashboard, which reported nearly $5 billion worth of Bitcoin spot trades over a 24-hour period during the move past $9,000. On most days, this figure is closer to $2-3 billion. Bitwise reported on April 29 that Bitcoin spot volume nearly hit $5 billion, far above the normal ... [+] $2-3 billion. Binance, which is the top exchange on Bitwise’s volume dashboard registered a new all-time high in trading activity on April 29. Much of this trading activity took place on Binance’s Bitcoin/USDT and Ethereum/USDT markets. What’s Behind The Spike In Buying Activity?Behind the recent jump in buying activity on cryptocurrency exchanges is a positive trend of fundamentals for Bitcoin. In approximately 11 days, according to BitcoinBlockHalf.com, Bitcoin will see its latest block reward reduction, also known as a halving. Halvings are automated events that ensure the number of coins issued per block gets cut in half every four years. At the start of April, Google Trends data indicated that the popularity of the term “Bitcoin halving” had begun to increase at a rapid clip. This trend has continued into the start of May, with the search engine reporting that global users are searching for information about the event more than ever before. Since the start of April, the public's interest in the Bitcoin halving has increased parabolically. Similarly, cryptocurrency marketer and writer “Molly” reported on April 22 that the Chinese term for “Bitcoin halving” briefly became the sixth-most popular trending search term on Weibo, a social media platform with over 400 million active users. Also boosting BTC is the response by central banks to the ongoing slowdown in the global economy. Michael Collett, a co-founder of digital asset management platform Stack, told Forbes senior contributor Charles Bovaird recently:“Set against the broader context of excessive monetary easing policies and ‘unlimited’ economic stimuli in major economies, [Bitcoin’s recent] gains are likely just the beginning.”The confluence of a decrease of leverage in the cryptocurrency market and an increase in spot exchange activity, spurred by positive fundamentals, gives credence to the sentiment that Bitcoin is preparing to enter a sustainable uptrend in the weeks ahead."

 hedge fund manager Raoul Pal predicts that the price of bitcoin to hit $1,000,000 within 3 years; and Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht predicted that it could hit an astronomical price of $333,000,000 per bitcoin. More bitcoin millionaires may materializeDuring the previous 2 bitcoin halvings, countless millionaires were created. J.R. Forsyth, the founder of Onfo was one of them. He was studying mathematics as an undergraduate and was exposed to bitcoin and digital ledger technology.  Forsyth says, “It became obvious to me that math-based currencies (like bitcoin) would eventually supplant sovereign notes. I mined bitcoin and litecoin very early on and held onto them. The massive appreciation of those assets allowed me to invest in other cryptocurrency technology which ultimately led to the development of Onfo, a platform that helps people earn money through network mining.”Or take Alan Glanse, charity founder and CEO of the cannabis business JuicyFields for instance. During his Wall Street days, he bought 100 bitcoins from a colleague that urgently needed money in 2012. Then, he forgot about his bitcoin. It wasn’t until the parabolic price highs of 2017’s second bitcoin halving, that he realized that he had become an instant millionaire.Glanse believes that the stimulus package will only strengthen the US economy and substantial market growth can be witnessed 2-3 months after the bitcoin halving event.The Federal ReserveThe Fed’s balance sheet is expected to exceed $6.5 trillion this year, with never seen before levels of money printing. In retrospect, that represents an increase of more than $2 trillion in under 6 weeks. Todd Crossland, CEO of CoinZoom says that “While I applaud and support the government in taking the most aggressive measures in providing stimulus for the economy, just the magnitude of the stimulus and printing of dollars, and the accompanying debt gives me a reason to pause. The stimulus will come with inflation and subsequently pressure on the value of the dollar. In my opinion, this paints another bull case for bitcoin and digital assets.”Right now, the world is undergoing a major financial shift. During the black swan stock market crash of March 2020, investors dropped stocks for cash, resulting in a liquidity crunch. The price of bitcoin and other digital crypto assets took a temporary nosedive. Since then, bitcoin has fully recovered, along with most other crypto assets. That said, if the Fed’s stimulus plan results in deflation, then followed shortly after by hyperinflation, this could paint a very bullish scenario for bitcoin.A massive shift in wealthBillionaire investor and founder of Bridgewater Associates, Ray Dalio, believes that in the near future, there could be a massive shift of wealth. Many in the crypto community have taken this to imply that cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are the solution to which Dalio speaks of. If that’s the case, then a new class of millionaires may emerge from the severe crisis that is gripping the world’s economy.  Dalio says, “Governments that have the power to do so are printing money to help ease the debt burdens and help finance the expenses that are denominated in their own currencies, which will weaken their own currencies and raise their levels of monetary inflation to offset the deflation that is coming from reduced demand and forced asset sales that are happening as those that are stretched have to raise cash.” Dalio is a firm believer that wealth cannot simply be created by producing more money and credit and that the long-term debt cycle is coming to its end. Dalio suspects that a restructuring of the monetary system is imminent. With countries like Venezuela, Lebanon, and the Bahamas exchanging local currencies for bitcoin, then Dalio may indeed be correct. If that is the case, then the third bitcoin halving could be a major catalyst for monetary change, resulting in a generation of new crypto millionaires.  "

GOOGL
 is rolling out a new core algorithm update in May. Christopher Jaszczynski, who is a technical on-chain analyst, speaker, and YouTuber says, “This is public knowledge. Since Google owns YouTube this is also escalating from media outlets that rely on Google traffic to bitcoin and crypto YouTubers. All big bitcoin YouTuber’s including our MMCrypto channel are now being shadowbanned.”Christopher JaszczynskiJaszczynski adds, “I noticed that in June and December 2019 the YouTube purge was happening through strikes, which prevented us from uploading our bitcoin technical analysis videos. ‘Shadow-banning’ however is more of a stealth approach. It limits the reach of YouTube videos, and as a result, this significantly decreases the number of views that we receive.”Google says, “Later today, we are releasing a broad core algorithm update, as we do several times per year. It is called the May 2020 Core Update. Our guidance about such updates remains as we’ve covered before.” Reports flood in“Besides our MMCrypto Channel, also the channels DavinciJ15, The Moon, Ivan on Tech, Sunny Decree, Altcoin Daily, and many other channels have been affected. They reported a decline in views after a few hours after publishing, which is exactly what we’re experiencing here at MM Crypto,” says Jaszczynski.A YouTube video with the shadowban: After the core audience is reached YouTube ""caps the reach"" and ... [+] no new people can be reached through the browse function.But Google’s update is not limited to crypto YouTuber’s, it has also hit some crypto news outlets as well. Carl Martin Runefelt, YouTuber and founder of The Moon AB says, “This latest development regarding YouTube censorship against bitcoin-videos is very alarming. Youtube is now clearly deliberately limiting the reach of my videos when I put the word bitcoin in the title.” Carl Martin RunefeltRunefelt adds, “I've never seen this before on my channel, and now it is happening to all of the biggest YouTubers in the bitcoin space simultaneously in the past few days. After three hours of uploading the video, suddenly the views drop by 90%, and it can not be seen in search results. Also, some of my 100,000 subscribers have reported that my videos are no longer getting recommended to them.” Runefelt further goes on to say that, “As I mentioned previously this does not only affect YouTube. Also U.Today had a significant decline in Google search traffic yesterday. CEO Eliah told me personally that ‘We have a notable loss of traffic and lower positions in Google news with each category. We’re trying to count exact numbers at the moment. We also have noticed the same situations with other crypto news websites but they haven’t revealed data yet.’“The impact on cryptoJaszczynski says, “Well the beauty about bitcoin is that it is non-confiscatable and censorship-resistant. We truly believe that education should be as well. Right now we are facing an unprecedented crisis, with record-high unemployment claims and expected GDP declines of 10% in some countries. We expect a severe crisis to come.” Education is important. “People have to be educated about things like gold and bitcoin to secure their wealth. Central banks are printing more money than ever and if this continues we might see hyperinflation evolving in a few years. If people are not prepared the lower and middle class will be hit the hardest. We really want to educate people on monetary policy, financial markets, on-chain analysis, and bitcoin. That's why we need independent media covering these things,” says Jaszczynski. A potential YouTube boycott on the horizon?When asked about what Jaszczynski would do if Google continues to block and shadowban crypto content, Jaszczynski remarks, “We are right now decentralizing our audience. Besides our Main YouTube Channel, we have another german Channel MMCrypto DE, Telegram Channels with more than 15’000 members, and also our Twitter account MMCrypto. Furthermore, we will open accounts on decentralized streaming platforms.” Whilst, Jaszczynski is content using YouTube, if Google continues crypto censorship, he may not be given a choice to move on and use another platform. If that is the case, then it is likely that others may follow suit.Jaszczynski says, “I have to admit that YouTube is the number 1 place to go for content and that I personally like the platform since I am using it every day also for my own research. It will need a lot of time until these decentralized streaming platforms will gain enough momentum that we can reach the mainstream with it.” Some YouTubers are moving to self hosting in order to protect themselves. “We do all our live-streams exclusively on Ivan on Tech live in order to ensure our community stays alive even if YouTube decides to remove our channel. We still upload the replays to YouTube,” says Ivan on Tech.An auspicious time for censorshipGoogle’s alleged crypto censorship comes at an auspicious time. Right now, bitcoin is about to enter its third halving, an event that has historically seen bitcoin reach all-time new highs. Jaszczynski says, “One important thing to note is that this third bitcoin and crypto purge is happening at a very interesting timing. The bitcoin halving is going to go down in 4 days.”“The future inflation of bitcoin is going to be cut in half. Long term this is a very powerful mechanism and shows how bitcoin is a deflationary asset that potentially protects people from holding it long term against the loss of purchasing power caused by the central banks’ quantitative easing. We hope this censorship stops and we will be able to educate people on these crucial facts.”"

[+] market share. (Photo by Chesnot/Getty Images)","On April 17, cryptocurrency exchange operator Binance released a white paper describing the inner workings of a new smart contract blockchain, a year after the initial launch of its native blockchain Binance Chain (BC). The new blockchain, dubbed the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), will work as a smart contract layer parallel to the existing chain, the company said.“This innovative solution brings the interoperability and programmability of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) to Binance Chain. Both Binance Chain and Binance Smart Chain will allow transfers and other communication thanks to the native support of interoperability,” the exchange wrote in a blog post.Despite the exchange insisting that the BSC isn’t designed to compete with Ethereum, which is presently the largest smart contract platform, Binance’s new smart contract platform should have superior performance to Ethereum in certain areas, including faster and cheaper transactions, the white paper shows.The latest Binance white paper in the area of blockchain development is only the latest of similar announcements from bitcoin exchanges.Since Binance launched its native blockchain in April 2019, at least three other leading centralized digital asset exchanges have announced that they are developing a blockchain network.In February, OKEx announced that its own blockchain OKChain was proceeding to test mode. The Malta-based crypto exchange first disclosed that it is developing a blockchain, along with a decentralized exchange (DEX) built on top, in March 2020.“OKChain is a commercial public chain developed by OKEx independently, and it is already 100% open-source to provide an efficient, free and boundless value-added ecosystem for all of our ecological partners,” said Jay Hao, CEO of OKEx. “The cross-chain and ‘OpenDEX’ technology enable us to push forward our vision of ‘Commercial Chain Alliance’ to facilitate the substantial development of the blockchain industry. “ In March, Huobi also announced that its blockchain was entering test mode, nearly two years since the Singapore-based bitcoin exchange first revealed plans to develop a native blockchain. Bithumb, based in South Korea, is also developing on its own blockchain, according to an announcement published in November 2019.Some crypto industry participants see the emerging trend as a threat to decentralization, which is a linchpin feature of public blockchain networks.Exchanges are among the biggest winners of the growing popularity of cryptocurrencies. They play an important role as the gateway to the crypto world, and many of them have built multimillion-dollar businesses off it.United States-based exchange Coinbase reportedly had a revenue projection of nearly $1.3 billion in 2018. Elsewhere, crypto news website The Block, estimated that Binance had reached $1 billion in cumulative profit, as of Sept 30, 2019. The news website arrived at that figure based on the company’s token buyback structure.At its core, the emerging trend of exchange-built blockchain platforms is a move by exchanges to consolidate their positions as industry leaders and, in some way, build a moat around their respective businesses. That’s the consensus view of cryptocurrency and blockchain commentators.By developing their own blockchain, crypto exchanges will be able to grow their market share and operate more efficiently, according to Ken Misuma, CMO of Quras, a smart contract platform that claims to give consumers and enterprises the freedom to set the privacy level of their transactions.“Digital asset exchanges try to attract as many traders as they can in order to increase their user base, which is a core driver of their profits,” Misuma said. “Developing a blockchain allows an exchange to have more flexibility from a usability and trading offering perspective without the need of a centralized operator.”Hugo Renaudin, CEO LGO, an institutional crypto exchange based in Europe touched on how having a blockchain could help exchanges become more efficient.“Operationally, it's a significant cost-cutter as a lot of operations and fund movements — deposit, withdrawals or settlements — can be automated through smart contracts,” he said. “And because an exchange blockchain lowers the overall listing costs for a cryptocurrency issued the chain, one might argue that it allows exchanges to list more and more assets at a lower cost.”As the blockchain and cryptocurrency space continues to evolve, an increasing number of digital assets will be issued. The resultant effect of more crypto assets is that the business of running an exchange will enjoy higher demands.Prior to when exchanges started building their own blockchain, new projects issue digital assets via a public blockchain such as Ethereum. These projects then seek to list their respective digital assets or tokens on different exchanges. Token holders and traders have the flexibility of trading these tokens across different exchanges where they are listed. This flexibility, however, means that the exchanges face a constant risk of losing their user base to competitors, which could lead to dwindling revenues.In addition to the competition from other centralized exchanges, the emergence decentralized trading is a growing threat.By developing a native blockchain, to which it invites projects to issue digital assets, an exchange is more likely to retain trading volumes — a critical determinant of their top line.Still, the principles upon which crypto exchanges are building their exchanges differ and potentially indicate the areas of the industry that each of them wants to be most relevant.Bitcoin, ether and XRP exchanges want to protect their profitable businesses by building native ... [+] blockchain networks. (Photo by Chesnot/Getty Images)While the development of a dedicated smart contract blockchain presents an opportunity for it to compete with Ethereum, Binance seems focused on growing its market share of the crypto exchange market.The BSC whitepaper reiterates that the company’s DEX is the “primary focus” of its native blockchain, an indication that the development of a smart contract platform is rather to augment the DEX than anything else.“The concentration on providing a convenient digital asset issuing and trading venue also brings limitations. Binance Chain's most requested feature is the programmable extendibility, or simply the smart contract and virtual machine functions. Digital asset issuers and owners struggle to add new decentralized features for their assets or introduce any sort of community governance and activities,” the BSC white paper reads.Another indication that Binance is betting on the future of exchanges is the February launch of Binance Cloud — an exchange-specific cloud solution. Through it, the company is offering anyone the ability to launch a crypto exchange that leverages the company’s already-established exchange infrastructure. CEO Changpeng Zhao, known in the crypto space as CZ, estimates that the cloud services will become the company’s source of revenue in five years. Liquidity is one of the promises of the cloud solution, a promise possibly insured by the volume-retention benefit of owning a blockchain.Following the footsteps of Binance to move operations to crypto-friendly island Malta, OKEx has seemingly been playing doppelgänger to Binance. However, OKEx insists that its own blockchain endeavors aren’t an imitation.“OKChain is not replicating Binance,” an OKEx spokesperson said. “Our blockchain has totally different visions and positioning than Binance Chain and we are actually working on different products.”The vision with OKChain is to drive the growth of decentralized commercial applications, particularly toward financial inclusion.“We believe decentralized finance is the key to financial inclusion and financial freedom for all. That’s why we have longed for unleashing the power of DeFi.” Hao said in a blog post announcing the testnet launch. “OKChain is a huge milestone for us, meaning that we are now able to provide an open, low-cost, and autonomous ecosystem for everyone to enjoy the benefits blockchain and decentralization brings.”Just how the exchange plans to use its blockchain network to play in the DeFi space remains unclear.For now, OKEx continues to take its exchange business seriously, having said a DEX will be the first application to lunch on OKChain. Compared to Binance, which “is building [its own] chain and creating the DEX application, we are building a financial infrastructure and the OKEx DEX is only one of the applications on OKChain,” the OKEx spokesperson added.OKEx says it will allow users to create and customize their own DEX on OKChain.In addition, OKChain supports the deployment of smart contracts out of the box, compared to Binance, which has only just announced the development of a separate chain for smart contracts.While other cryptocurrency exchanges were avoiding regulators, Huobi decided to build a relationship with China’s government. Last December, Huobi announced that it was joining a government-led blockchain alliance. The exchange is looking to deepen its relationships with regulators, and subsequently financial enterprises, by making compliance central to its native blockchain development.""DeFi has become one of the most promising applications of blockchain technology but its future requires both sides — regulators and enterprises — to work together to establish the standards and guidelines of the new decentralized economy,"" said Ciara Sun, VP of Global Business at Huobi Group. ""With Huobi Chain, we want to provide the decentralized framework that facilitates industry-wide collaboration, which is critical to the widespread adoption of DeFi.""Huobi Chain will allow regulators to take part in the network as validators through a regulatory node feature. This might look familiar to followers of blockchain-related regulatory updates in the U.S. Last year, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston released a white paper in which it detailed concepts for a “supervisory node” for on-chain regulatory surveillance.While exchanges blockchains are being set up to address different parts of the blockchain space, they all stand to benefit from a rise in their native token value if their bets pay off.For one, exchange tokens, which were originally used to pay trading and listing fees, are now transitioning into coins that power an entire blockchain. That widens usability, and potentially, value for these tokens.In fact, it could give the companies behind each blockchain network a valuation boost, SKALE Labs CEO Jack O’Holleran believes.“Valuation multiples for exchanges on fees are significantly lower than multipliers on crypto assets, which are non-dilutive compared to equity,” said O’Holleran, whose startup is building a scalability solution for Ethereum. “As a simple example, if an exchange is making $100 million a year in fees, they may get a 5-7x multiplier on their value, meaning they are worth $500-$700 million from an equity perspective.“If they release a token that is utilized to pay for fees, that token may be worth multiple billions from a fully diluted perspective with the same amount of revenue.”It’s unclear how much power exchanges exert over their native blockchain networks and that raises questions about just how decentralized these networks are. “One major disadvantage is that exchange-built blockchains are typically not truly decentralized, and decentralization is one of the most valuable aspects of blockchain technology, said Misuma.Following the release of the Binance Smart Chain white paper, Tom Shaughnessy of Delphi Digital, a crypto asset research firm echoed similar concerns in an interview with Cointelegraph. “Centralized chains miss the point, every time. The point is not to offer cheaper transactions, anyone can do this using Amazon Web Services, but to foster a community-driven ethos of builders who enjoy working together without a centrally derived mandate.”"

The first quarter of 2020 also yielded 250% more bitcoin trading volume than the first quarter of 2019, when traded against the U.S. dollar, an Uphold representative told me via email. [Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.]After the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 12, 2020, mainstream financial markets tumbled drastically. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (Dow) fell 10% on the same day, making for the stock index’s bloodiest single-day outing since the crash of 1987, according to CNBC reporting. In the days following, U.S. governing bodies further pushed business closures and shelter-in-place guidelines in an effort to combat the spread of COVID-19, slowing economic progression.Some companies, such as Amazon

, however, have seen business boom as citizens stay home, looking to online shops to deliver their goods. Uphold, a marketplace for buying and selling cryptocurrencies, fiat currencies (national currencies), precious metals and other assets, has also seen tremendous growth through the storm. Several days before COVID-19 measures took flight, Uphold unveiled its new debit MasterCard

, funded by an account capable of holding various assets on Uphold’s platform. Essentially, funds held in a user’s multi-asset Uphold account are exchanged into cash for whatever the user buys at the point of sale when using the card, a March 5 statement from the company said. Compatible at any MasterCard-friendly locations, Uphold’s card also allows for ATM cash withdrawals. At the time of the March 5 announcement, interested U.S. customers could pre-order the card. “Over the last couple of weeks, we’ve started releasing the card to our substantial waitlist, and the early figures are MUCH better than we were budgeting,” Thieriot told me on April 24. Although the card’s unveiling came during a comparatively standout financial quarter for the company, providing an additional avenue for mainstream crypto and other asset adoption and usage, Thieriot said the debit card was not the main growth driver for 2020’s first quarter. “The rising numbers are certainly more due to COVID-related volatility and market dynamics than the release of the card,” Thieriot said. “The novel coronavirus has turned the digital payments space on its head.”Uphold also saw XRP trading volume against the U.S. dollar up 150% in the first quarter of 2020 compared to 2019’s first quarter. Uphold is not the only outfit to see a spike in numbers around this time, however. Data from analytics company Skew showed record bitcoin options trading volume on February 11 and March 9 for LedgerX, Deribit, Bakkt, OKEx and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) — some of the industry’s top exchanges hosting bitcoin trading — CoinDesk reported on March 10.

(Photo by Yuriko Nakao/Getty Images)","Hundreds of millions of dollars a year in risk-free profits could be hiding in the markets for Bitcoin, experts say. The market for Bitcoin has grown massively in the decade or so since the cryptocurrency got invented. But that growth has not come in tandem with efficient markets where the price of one bitcoin is worth roughly the same on every cryptocurrency exchange, according to new research published recently in the Financial Analysts Journal (FAJ). Crypto exchanges routinely show significant price differentials for Bitcoin, the research shows. Those price differences should allow traders to buy bitcoin on an exchange where it is priced lower and then simultaneously sell where it is priced higher. That means traders can achieve instant profits that are free of risk. This trading technique, known as arbitrage, is common in large markets and is an activity usually engaged in by banks and other financial institutions. The total profits potentially available from bitcoin arbitrage in 2017 totaled $377 million at a minimum, according estimates detailed in the FAJ paper titled “Decentralized Efficiency? Arbitrage in Bitcoin Markets” by Sinan Krückeberg and Peter Scholz. The authors also say the minimum arbitrage opportunities available in the first quarter of 2018 totaled $384 million. What’s notable about the findings is that as markets grow in size these inter-market pricing discrepancies usually quickly shrink as professional arbitrage traders enter the markets. But the opposite has occurred in the Bitcoin market. In the decade or so since it was invented, the market has grown from near-zero to $0.8 trillion, the authors say. Yet the arbitrage opportunities seem to have grown in size rather than shrink as most market observers would have expected. In 2016 the research findings show that the potential for arbitrage totaled a paltry $1.1 million. Yet a year later, that had grown more than 300-fold and then grew approximately another four-fold on an annualized basis into the first three months of 2018. When market opportunities such as these exist, you can expect institutions to pay attention and start setting up sophisticated crypto arbitrage operations to garner their piece of the profit pie. Or put another way, get ready for the big guns to enter the market."

[+] bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.,"Yele Bademosi is passionate about helping his home continent of Africa. Born into a missionary home in Ibadan, Nigeria, Bademosi’s mother and father used to deliver medical services and bibles to the Yoruba tribes-people in the forests surrounding his home-town, often going from hut to hut. When he and his sisters were old enough, they helped. “That is my earliest memory in terms of thinking about how to give back,” he says, “But as I grew older, I changed my views to thinking about, how do you actually help people at scale?” Last year, Bademosi became a director at the venture capital arm of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange Binance, which trades $1.5 billion in crypto assets each day. And today he is excited because he’s launching Bundle, one of six African startups the Malta-based crypto exchange is now funding, and the first it launched. The startup is being run by Africans in an effort to get people on the continent to use cryptocurrency, not as an investment vehicle, but as a global means of exchange. Bundle is essentially a social payments app, similar to Venmo or Square’s Cash App. The new app lets users send, receive and spend bitcoin, ether, and Nigerian naira with little more than the recipient’s phone number. Unlike Square though, Bundle will also let users spend Binance coin (BNB), the exchange’s native cryptocurrency, which has been doled out to loyal and active traders using its crypto exchange. In the near future they’ll be able to spend and (more importantly) save Binance U.S. dollars (BUSD), stablecoins backed by U.S. dollars and regulated in the United States.Bundle joins numerous tech giants working on ventures in Africa. Facebook intends to co-launch a cryptocurrency targeting the unbanked and Square’s founder Jack Dorsey recently announced plans to immigrate to the continent. “Regardless of your geography, you should have access to the best financial services. And unfortunately, your geography today defines the quality of financial services that you have,” says Bademosi, who is also Bundle’s CEO. “The same way the internet created freedom of information, I think blockchains create freedom of quality of financial services.”Born in 1991, the only boy among five sisters, Bademosi always knew entrepreneurship was in his future. Perhaps rebelling from his bossy sisters, he knew he didn’t want to work for others. Bademosi’s first experience with a computer was at an internet cafe. As a child, he’d walk up a flight of stairs to the second floor of his local shopping center, push open a sliding door and frantically scan for cheat codes to his favorite computer games in 30-minute chunks, before his money ran out.It wasn’t until 2007, when Bademosi was 16-years-old, that he finally got his first computer, an Acer Aspire One Series his parents got for him when he started classes at Lansdowne College, a preparatory school for University, similar to a high-school, in Westminster, England. For the first time, he had unlimited online access and an outlet to focus his burgeoning interests. By the time he graduated two years later, the 6’ 6” Bademosi had not only competed on the school’s football and basketball teams, but studied biology, chemistry, psychology and mathematics. “There's a huge difference between what you learn in college in a structured environment and what you can learn online,” he says. “It felt like what I imagined the Enlightenment period felt like for people who lived when the printing press was first available.” Growing up in Nigeria, he says, meant that students who did well in school were pushed into the sciences. When his youngest sister decided to go into economics, or what he called “liberal-type accounting,” he was in shock. In spite of his entrepreneurial aspirations, he knew he would be expected to either to become a medical doctor like his father, an engineer or an architect. He hated physics though, so passed on engineering, and architecture was out because as he put it, “I couldn't draw straight lines.” His father convinced him that even if he didn’t end up practicing medicine, the University of London’s accelerated three-year program meant he’d have extra time afterwards to find a path of his own, and he enrolled in 2009.In his first year of medical school his father died of kidney-failure. His father’s death gave him the courage to rebel. He had always found that he was more interested in computers than medicine so he dropped out of medical school with plans to build apps for Apple’s OS. After a few unsuccessful months building a social media app Bademosi flew back to Nigeria. Bademosi works in his company's office.There he got a job as manager of Starta, devoted to helping African companies get off the ground by providing education, tools, and networking opportunities. After developing a taste for helping startups get off the ground, Bademosi founded his own angel investing firm called Mircotraction. His venture had well connected backers: Nigerian energy and real estate tycoon, Tunde Folawiyo; the CEO of Y-Combinator, Michael Siebel, and Google’s head of ecosystem for sub-Saharan Africa, Andy Volk. Lagos-based Microtraction is now among the most active investors in Western Africa, having funded 15 companies, including 54gene, an African genomics research startup that recently attracted $15 million from Adjuvant Capital, Y-Combinator and others. Bademosi had learned about bitcoin in college but it wasn’t until 2017 after he read a book called Master Switch by Columbia professor Tim Wu, that he began to see blockchain as a way to let networks of individuals compete against the likes of Facebook, Amazon, Google, and Apple using a shared technology infrastructure. “We’re not there yet,” he says. ‘But I believe that blockchain and decentralized technologies can open up the internet again, and create a new playing field that new entrants could play on.”While the jump from medicine to blockchain may seem big , Bademosi sees them as strongly related. “The similarity really is the fact that you have individual organisms, whether that's a cell or a human or a computer, acting in their own best interests towards what's still a common goal, and there are a bunch of rules they all have to obey.”Just a few months after founding Microtraction in August 2017, Bademosi bought his first bitcoin and as its price fluctuated wildly he became hooked on crypto asset investing. That led him to Binance, which was, founded in China, and is now doing business from Malta. In November 2018, Binance published a ten-point thesis on why it was dedicated to the continent and launched a subsidiary in Uganda. Number four on Binance’s list was Bademosi’s childhood mantra: scalability. “For me, blockchains are as big as the internet,” says Bademosi. “And can you imagine Bill Gates or Larry Page or, Mark, Zuckerberg coming to Africa less than one year after the company was started?” He was impressed. So much so, that by January 2019, he had pitched his vision for what Binance should be doing in Africa and instead of taking him up on his advice, the company hired him, making him the first director at Binance Labs focused on investing in Africa-based blockchain startups and leading the Africa chapter of the organization’s incubation program. So far Binance Labs has invested in five African startups, one from South Africa, one from Kenya, one from Ghana and three from Nigeria, all serving different aspects of the content’s growing crypto economy. Notably, Lagos-based Yellow Card is a way to buy bitcoin even without a bank via local agents, and Flutterwave is the same fiat-to-crypto bridge that lets Binance customers buy cryptocurrency with naira.Bundle backend engineer Kenny Shittu (left) meets with blockchain engineer Oluchi Enebeli, user ... [+] experience designer Ugo Ifezue, backend engineer Seyi Ajonibode and operations associate Chinny Eze at Bundle's offices on March 9, 2020Binance and its new Bundle have Western competitors in Africa. Facebook’s Libra has its sights set on banking the unbanked. Another potential competitor using cryptocurrency to serve the unbanked is Akon, the Senegalese-American musician whose Akoin project announced recently that it would be the exclusive currency of the Mwale Medical Technology City in Kenya. “Our goal is for akoin to be the official currency of the continent,” says Akon.To give an idea of the total market up for grabs here, even if the average account holder might only own a fraction of what Western banks require to open an account, the World Bank estimates that 1.7 billion adults around the world are without such access. Fifty-seven percent of adults in sub-Saharan African, or about 350 million people, don’t have bank accounts, according to the World Bank. To help close that gap nearly $700 million was invested in fintech in Africa last year, according to media firm WeeTracker. Of the 1.2 billion people living in Africa, Bademosi estimates only 1.4 million are already using crypto. In two weeks Bundle expects to add BUSD, a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar, created by blockchain startup Paxos, regulated by the New York Department of Financial Services, and spendable anywhere in the world. One possible financial product that could eventually be offered using this technology would be what amounts to a savings account denominated in U.S. dollars for people living in Nigeria, and eventually other African nations. Instead of Nigerians losing 12% to inflation at current rates by keeping their cash in a savings account, they could be paid interest denominated in U.S. dollars for funds held in custody elsewhere. “Being able to save in stablecoins and earn interest per annum is huge,” says Bademosi. “And we can offer that up to anyone anywhere.”Users will also be able to cash in and cash out using local fiat currencies. Longer term plans include a physical debit card and the ability to purchase U.S. stocks, Nigerian mutual funds and agriculture debt, and unspecified incentive programs designed to jumpstart the cryptocurrency economy in Africa, according to internal documents provided to Forbes. The documents compare Bundle to Mosaic, the internet browser invented by Marc Andreessen, and credited for weaving together the previously esoteric processes required to use the internet into a single, intuitive browser. In September 2019, Bundle quietly raised $450,000 from Binance, Pave Investments and other African investors. “We believe Bundle can become one of the key projects that will support Binance's mission of scaling the adoption of crypto on the continent,” says Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ). To help do that, Bundle will be free at launch, with plans to eventually charge 0.5% to 2% per transaction on all short term trades and 3% of assets under management on yearly gains, for longer-term investing. While the finer details of how that works have yet to be announced, we can look to Binance for some intriguing clues. After creating BNB in July 2017, the asset has grown to a total market value of $2.2 billion, making it the eighth largest crypto-asset according to CoinMarketCap.com, the widely used cryptocurrency markets site Binance recently acquired for a reported $400 million. But it’s the way Binance uses that asset, which users acquire in exchange for making transactions on-site, that Bundle perhaps has the most to learn from. Binance’s users are allowed to pay their fees on the site using the same BNB cryptocurrency they are rewarded for being regular users, and a new platform, called LaunchPad, lets users raise capital via initial coin offerings (ICOs) also payable in BNB, establishing what cryptocurrency news site CoinDesk called “a virtuous cycle by which its users were incentivized to stay within its platform.” Bademosi, it would seem, has learned his lessons well, a promising sign for the future. “Bundle does an excellent job of putting fiat and crypto side by side,” he says. “And then nudging the user to use some of these digital currencies or assets in innovative ways.”"

The question remains then, do you?According to the latest ESET threat report, published today, blockchain.com is amongst the three most impersonated domains when it comes to homoglyph attacks. While apple.com led the homoglyph impersonation pack, most of the ESET telemetry detections came from a single, educational, source and were not malicious. The same cannot be said about the blockchain domain impersonators. So, if blockchain hackers know what a homoglyph looks like, and how to use one to relieve you of your bitcoin wallet, why don't you?Another newly published report, the geopolitical and cybersecurity risk weekly brief from threat intelligence specialists Cyjax, has revealed that between February and March there was a ""569% growth in malicious registrations and a 788% growth in high-risk registrations linked to scams, unauthorized cryptocurrency mining, and bulletproof hosting sites."" This comes as absolutely no surprise. While exploiting the search for information concerning COVID-19 is the plat du jour for hackers, that doesn't mean the rest of the criminal dishes are off the menu. Homoglyph attacks are one example of a gourmet cybercrime classic that has been making something of a revival recently.The Wikipedia definition of a homoglyph is a character, grapheme, or glyph that appears identical or at least remarkably similar to another in typography. A homoglyph attack, therefore, is one that exploits these similarities by replacing one with the other when registering a domain. In this way, two entirely distinct domains can appear to be identical in terms of their URLs at first glance and quite often second as well. This can happen as the characters come from different alphabets, even if identical in appearance, and computers see them as being different things, unlike the human eye. ""I’ve seen some extremely convincing links in my time, and so to the untrained eye, it’s no wonder they still appear in 2020,"" Jake Moore, a cybersecurity specialist at ESET, says. According to the ESET telemetry from its report, instagram.com and blockchain.com were the most impersonated malicious domains across the first quarter of 2020 in terms of homoglyph deception. Although mostly thought of as an email vector attack, social media has also been something of a playground for the hackers looking to deceive users into sending credentials into their inbox or capturing such data from a cloned website. You can see how easy this is to achieve, and just how similar domain names can be made to look, using the Homoglyph Attack Generator, a legitimate penetration testing tool.Attacks against blockchain make perfect sense to Ian Thornton-Trump, CISO at threat intelligence company Cyjax, especially if trying to grab bitcoin wallets at a time of economic uncertainty. It's not just your average cybercriminal chancer that will be interested in such attack methodologies either, ""regimes are looking for currency to prop up their economies,"" Thornton-Trump says, adding ""it's important to note that homoglyph attacks work really well when you target audiences with English as a second language.""There are, thankfully, several mitigations when it comes to this attack surface. For a start, your web browser client should warn you that all is potentially not well when attempting to visit a site using homoglyphs in the domain. ""Trusting links can be a minefield and so users are advised to trust their browser or antivirus should a warning appear,"" Moore says, ""the problem is if some users override such warnings and believe the initial link to be correct and follow through with entering personal details straight into the criminal’s database.""This brings us to mitigation number two: operators of the top-level domain registries have taken action to help prevent the registration of such lookalike .com, .edu and .net domains. Following a report by researchers at Soluble in March, it was confirmed that Verisign had changed its protections against this kind of mixed-script domain registration to include Unicode Latin IPA Extension characters that had managed to escape scrutiny before. Until all domain registries follow this lead, however, homoglyph attacks are likely to remain a concern moving forward.""Good web proxy software and community threat intelligence such as reporting malicious homoglyph-based links to VirusTotal, is key,"" says Thornton-Trump, continuing, ""many of these homoglyph attacks are only live for a few hours or at most days before they are identified as malicious.""Meanwhile, Moore concludes with the advice that even if you believe a link in an email or on social media to be genuine, ""still route into the website via another path such as searching for it online as trusting links can be a minefield."""

You can’t make people or organizations spend money, they may just stash the cash and bring down their debt. The new money will just fill the gap left by the lockdown and the huge supply capacities of the global economy will satisfy and demand pressure before it can create rising prices. It could happen.Little changeThat is a fat chance. Let’s all save our time not bothering with this Goldilocks scenario.HyperinflationEver since QE was unleashed in the aftermath of the “global financial crisis” grumpy old investors have been predicting “hyperinflation.” It didn’t happen. So why should it happen now? I could agree that it is not going to happen this time either and I can imagine hyperinflation as a possibility but not a certainty. However when you read this from Wikipedia on the subject of hyperinflation it is hard not to get a sinking feeling: “A sharp decrease in real tax revenue coupled with a strong need to maintain government spending, together with an inability or unwillingness to borrow, can lead a country into hyperinflation.”I don’t think the government borrowing from itself via the Federal Reserve counts are “borrowing” but even if it does the above is an extremely disquieting summary of how hyperinflation could come next.So what is an investor to do?The simple answer is to increase weightings towards inflation hedges. In my case I want a really powerful inflation hedge so I don’t have to load up on too many borderline liquid or outright illiquid assets or assets where I need to struggle through layers of greedy middlemen or there is a counterparty risk. There is no good getting the call right if you get robbed along the way. Well that suddenly makes it very difficult to get the trade on.The classic move is to buy gold. I could buy lots of “paper” gold but in an environment of hyperinflation that paper is likely to turn to ashes. It does not take a trading guru to look at the paper oil market and see what can happen to your money in extreme situations. So, I need physical gold. Okay, where exactly am I going to put that? In a safe deposit box that might go “bye bye.” I could have it delivered to my house and bury it in the basement and have my name and address on a shipping manifest with a treasure chest of gold with X marks the spot scribbled on it. OK so I drop the paranoia, now I have to wire the money, pay a huge premium, get it delivered perhaps in a couple of weeks and have to repeat the process backwards if I ever want to convert it into trillion dollar bills.It’s doable, but its ugly.So while I was musing that with a milky coffee, I logged into my bank, sent a cars-worth of fiat to a crypto exchange, bought some bitcoin (BTC) and transferred it out to a wallet. All before I was left looking at an empty mug of beverage.That, right there, is a fabulous advantage of bitcoin as digital gold.I then looked at places to buy bullion and it’s mainly sold out. So the upshot is, when more than the preppers suddenly realize they need to get hedged against inflation, gold will rise a lot and bitcoin will explode.Bitcoin will explode because there is simply not much of it and it will explode because you can buy it, secure it, take it with you, turn it back into money and actually spend it natively at the click of a mouse. By comparison gold is like some relic from the dark ages. Oh wait… it is…So while in the short term, the upcoming “halvening” will certainly support prices of bitcoin, any whiff of the new “zillions and trillions” of stimulus setting off inflation will drive the price of crypto and especially bitcoin to the moon.There was more U.S. QE in a week in March than the total value of all the bitcoin out there..Meanwhile, here is the chart of bitcoin and it looks bullish:The Bitcoin chart looks bullishAnd now a short message to Gold Bugs. If you haven’t already, you really do need to skill up on crypto. It is a very steep learning curve but it is definitely worth it. It doesn’t cost more than a few bucks and serial headaches to get up to speed and play with some to get comfortable. The reason you love gold is a close match to the utility you can get from crypto and if you are right about what happens next, you will probably need the flexible benefits of a digital proxy. What is good for gold is good for bitcoin.—-Clem Chambers is the CEO of private investors website ADVFN.com and author of 101 Ways to Pick Stock Market Winners and Trading Cryptocurrencies: A Beginner’s Guide.

In May 2019, he tweeted “Pay me in bitcoin,” sparking excitement over the crypto twitter airwaves, though his requests were ultimately denied. Most recently, Okung launched Okung Ventures, backing Bitcoin loyalty startup, Fold.I spoke to Okung about his views on bitcoin, economic access and democratization, his investment in Fold, and what he believes is coming next in the crypto space.SR: Why did you invest in Fold and what promise do you see in Fold's bitcoin cash-back rewards card?RO: I believe bitcoin is the best way to empower people with control over their own value, and so my main criteria for investing in bitcoin companies is that they simplify the onboarding process for bitcoin rookies. The Fold Visa 
  
V
 card creates a totally new way to participate in the bitcoin economy which doesn't require people to change their spending behavior or even take any financial risks before they can start accumulating bitcoin.Fold's New Visa Bitcoin Back Debit CardFold, the app that allows consumers to earn bitcoin when shopping at retailers, announced on April 9, that it was launching a co-branded Visa card that allows consumers to earn bitcoin rewards. Consumers will be able to use the Fold card to spend dollars and earn bitcoin back on every purchase made with the card, drastically reducing the barrier to entry to bitcoin adoption.SR: What is needed for bitcoin to reach mainstream adoption and how is Fold furthering that aim?RO: Simple tools that incentivize the average person to engage with bitcoin without having to do too much work. Most people don’t have the time or energy to research all of the possible implications of sound money, but you start offering them free money every time they shop at Amazon 
  
AMZN
 and Uber like Fold does? Now we’re talking. To Fold’s customers, bitcoin may be preferred over airline miles, loyalty points, and other store-specific rewards programs. Since bitcoin has no expiration date, the rewards can be used to offset the cost of a consumer’s next purchase, saved, or withdrawn—giving consumers freedom and flexibility. Consumers can also spend from their bitcoin rewards by purchasing fiat-denominated gift cards for retailers on the Fold app to use on their next purchase or allow the value to accumulate like they would in a savings account. Fold Bitcoin SavingsSR: What role do you envision bitcoin will play in the future economy and why do you believe expanding adoption is critical?RO: Bitcoin changes everything. As economic uncertainty continues to take its toll on our everyday lives, I believe we’ll see more and more people experience a shift in how they relate to money. Bitcoin offers us a practical solution to overcome the imminent demise of the legacy financial system. The launch of the Fold Card represents an important milestone in the maturation of the cryptocurrency industry. Like its app, Fold aims to make bitcoin fun and accessible to everyone. It functions the same as any other card with the added benefit of earning bitcoin back on every purchase. SR: Anything else you'd like to share that might be of interest?RO: Last year I tweeted “Pay Me in Bitcoin” because I believe that finding more ways to EARN bitcoin is just as important as getting more people interested in simply buying bitcoin. This is another aspect of Fold that I’m excited about: when you are rewarded with bitcoin, it's another opportunity to examine your relationship to money and keep asking deeper questions about economic realities we tend to ignore.SR: Thank you.Athletes are no strangers to bitcoin. As written in this 2019 Ballers and Bitcoin piece, “Georgia Tech began accepting Bitcoin for its stadium concession sales in 2014. Marshawn Lynch, former Seattle Seahawks running back and Superbowl XLVIII Champion, invested in a blockchain company in 2015. His teammate, Richard Sherman, started accepting Bitcoin for merchandise on his website as early as 2014.” While many companies, athletes, and entrepreneurs have sought to explore the technology for ticket purchases and authentication, merchandise, memorability, sports betting and stadium concessions, few have tackled bitcoin adoption head-on.Okung’s investment in Fold, however, represents perhaps the first example of an athlete backing a company that aims to get bitcoin directly in the hands of individuals by earning, not buying, marking a step on the journey to mainstream adoption. Signups for early access to the Visa card are available on the Fold website,"

But with lockdowns now easing, economists are looking ahead to how the stimulus checks might affect businesses and the economy in the months to come, with some warning we could be in for a severe bout of inflation—potentially driving interest in deflationary assets such as bitcoin.U.S. President Donald Trump signed millions of stimulus checks that were sent to millions of ... [+] Americans around the country at the end of April.""I've always said, when the next recession occurs monetary policy is going to become even more unconventional,"" economist Nouriel Roubini, whose pessimistic reputation has earned him the nickname Dr. Doom, told the Odd Lots podcast. ""In advanced economies with some modicum of policy credibility left we're not going to end up in hyper inflation but, over the next few years, we may see inflation rise from the current very low levels to higher levels.""Roubini expects the post-coronavirus U.S. to go through a difficult recovery over ""two or three years,"" into an inflationary period, followed by a depression. Many of the lost jobs won't return. Others have echoed Roubini's concerns, with some warning of a more serious inflationary shock. ""What will then happen as the lockdown gets lifted and recovery ensues, following a period of massive fiscal and monetary expansion,"" asks Manoj Pradhan, founder of Talking Heads Macroeconomics, and Charles Goodhart, emeritus professor at the London School of Economics, in a paper published on the Centre for Economic Policy Research's Vox policy platform. ""The answer, as in the aftermath of wars, will be a surge in inflation, quite likely more than 5% and even in the order of 10% in 2021, assuming that the pandemic gets tamed by the end of this summer—the longer the outbreak takes to tame, the weaker will be the ensuing surge in real activity and then inflation.""This ""surge in inflation"" could take the likes of Trump, the Fed, and other central banks around the world off-guard as they focus on more pressing matters. The latest data shows over 30 million Americans filed for unemployment in the last six weeks.""In terms of tail risks not being focused on, inflation is definitely one of them,"" Gopi Karunakaran, a money manager at Ardea, told Bloomberg. Amid building fears over runaway inflation, the coronavirus pandemic has pushed some toward digital currencies such as bitcoin. ""The slow rise of digital currency has been given a gigantic boost by the pandemic,"" Gary Cohn, a former advisor to president Trump and one-time director of the U.S. National Economic Council, wrote in a Financial Times op-ed last week. Bitcoin is a scarce digital asset, meaning it has a fixed supply—topping out at a maximum 21 million bitcoin tokens. Bitcoin proponents have long argued bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will become more attractive in an inflationary environment.Many bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchanges around the world have reported a surge of new users and ... [+] trading volume since the coronavirus crisis began. Some have even claimed stimulus checks are being used to buy bitcoin. ""When the U.S. floods the market with dollars, this means that it will take more dollars to buy the same amount of equities [and] commodities,"" Anthony Pompliano, co-founder and partner at Morgan Creek Digital, said via Twitter back in March. ""Almost every asset price should rise, but the inflation hedges are likely to rise the most—gold [and] bitcoin,"" Pompliano said, pointing to gold's two-year rally that began in 2009, the year bitcoin was created.Meanwhile, bitcoin is on the verge of a supply squeeze, called a halving, that will see the number of bitcoin rewarded to those that maintain the bitcoin network, known as miners, halved.Many bitcoin traders and investors are betting the upcoming halving, set for May 12, will boost bitcoin's price.""In our opinion, the likely outcome of the halving is a positive supply-side impact over the mid- to longer-term,"" said Chris Bendiksen, head of research at CoinShares, a Jersey-based digital asset manager.""Macroeconomic tailwinds presented by global governments and the existing and growing inflows into passive bitcoin investment products we’re currently observing could cause a perfect storm for the bitcoin price over the mid- to long-term."""

Blamed for Hitler’s rise and the fall of the Weimar Republic, the downfall of the first American currency issued by the Continental Congress, and the cause of numerous downfalls of governments, hyperinflation was also something Bitcoin and its sound money principles were positioned against from the beginning with its 21 million Bitcoin limit — an idea that has spread, in spirit if not in practice, to many other cryptocurrencies. As the COVID-19 world positions itself into a strange potential stagflation situation due to the collapse of categories of demand due to lockdown restrictions as well as supply shocks caused by the disease, the fiat currencies of some governments are collapsing in value — leaving their people stranded, hungry, and desperate. This, in turn, leads to inflation — as belief in a government’s ability to pay its own debts and maintain a stable economy flounder, its fiat currency weakens, and the goods you can buy with that fiat currency decrease. Once that inflation hits a critical phase and continues accelerating, it is dubbed hyperinflation. In Lebanon, the government has defaulted on its debt and warned that its large amount of public foreign debt has lowered foreign exchange reserves to critical levels. Public spending cuts were promised by Prime Minister Hassan Diab, a technocrat partially supported by Hezbollah — along with a sobering projection that 40% of Lebanon’s population might sink below the poverty level. This, coupled with the troubles caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and ensuing lockdown, has created a critical amount of hyperinflation. The Lebanese pound has sunk to new lows, almost halving in value in a matter of weeks. Consumer goods prices have shot up 50%. Savers have been locked out of their deposits since mid-October, when unrest first emerged. Protests have been sparked in major cities across Lebanon as a result, with some protestors speaking of either “dying from the disease or dying from hunger”. The Lebanese military has fired on protestors with live ammunition and killed one, 26-year old Fawwaz Fouad al-Seman, sparking more unrest at his funeral. Amid this darkness, in perhaps the most humorous take on the situation, Lebanese protestors conducted a funeral for the Lebanese pound. The theme of cryptocurrency in Lebanon and the Middle East in general is still very nuanced. Questions of access to the banking system, a fiat currency worth exchanging cryptocurrencies for, or the electricity and Internet required to mine or run a node abound when it comes to retail exposure and usefulness of Bitcoin on the ground: while there are some small shoots of progress, it’s hard to characterize any cryptocurrency as having any significant effect in the current situation for the vast majority of the people affected.Where Bitcoin and cryptocurrency plays a larger role is in the theory behind what should be done, and what solution there might be. Lebanon, like many other countries before it, is going to the IMF for a solution and is likely to look to cut public spending and come to a settlement with its debt owners. A standard economic prescription is the increased dollarization of the economy, using a “safe haven” fiat currency as a substitute for a depreciating one in some fashion. In effect, this is what the depreciation of the Lebanese pound and shut access to the Lebanese banking system really represent: an increasing demand among the elite and the people of Lebanon for the US dollar. This is a tried-and-true formula — a country has significant US-based debts because its imports are priced in US dollars, but sold in domestic currency — and its foreign debt instruments are priced in US dollars too. So instead of trying to defend its now depreciating domestic currency, it might switch in various forms or altogether to a stronger, more currently credible fiat — likely the fiat unit its debts are denominated in, which with the current global financial order, is likely to be the USD. The challenge of cryptocurrency adherents is to place themselves in this discussion: ensure enough bottoms-up movement towards international transactional flows such that a top-down entity might consider a more partial dollarization or might switch to cryptocurrencies altogether from fiat currencies. This would involve making sure there was more baseline access to cryptocurrency tools, even among individuals who may have sporadic power or Internet access and creating more scale and usage, even in countries that are not typically seen as cryptocurrency hotspots. To be fair, that step may seem far off today, especially in the context of a country where there are sparks of cryptocurrency adoption, but little more — yet this urgent economic and political crisis is one of yet another chain of events that replicates itself year-after-year. Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies may not fully be able to help at scale yet — but in time, eroding trust in current financial systems ensures that this discussion will continue in places like Lebanon and beyond."

These blackmail campaigns continue today and victims are still paying. One criminal group is raking in over $100,000 a month.","Image:Sextortion emails always include a cryptocurrency wallet address. It’s where victims are supposed to send their payments... and it also provides researchers with a starting point for their investigations.The security experts at Sophos Labs tracked wallet activity in one sextortion campaign to learn more about the criminals behind it. Their findings shed some light on one of the most dastardly scams on the ‘net.Between September 1 last year and January 31, Sophos observed $500,000 in payments. The crypto analytics firm CipherTrace helped out with this part of the research, because it’s no small task to keep tabs on the roughly 50,000 Bitcoin wallets the criminals were cycling through. Only 261 of those wallets received payments, but 96 Bitcoin had been deposited by the end of January. Exchange rates at the time put that total at around $472,700.That averages out to about $3,100 every day. The average demand is around $800, which means these scammers are claiming as many as 4 new victims every day with their insidious emails.Sextortion scams may not be as lucrative as ransomware attacks, business email compromise (BEC), or cryptomining malware. They’re effective enough, however, especially considering the amount of effort required.Sophos says these operations are typically run by low-level scammers and there are few important things to remember about sextortion emails should you receive one.The scammers don’t actually have incriminating photos or videos of you. While it’s certainly possible for hackers to surreptitiously record you with your webcam, Sophos hasn’t seen evidence that these sextortion scammers are that sophisticated.There’s also a simple explanation for the second big scare in their emails: why they know one of your passwords.The truth is that by now lots of people probably know one or two passwords that match up with your email address. Some of these people are the good guys, like Troy Hunt, who founded the service Have I Been Pwned to help alert users when their credentials had been hacked or leaked.Others are cybercriminals who buy, sell, and trade password dumps on the dark web and in hacking forums. Billions of records are floating around and many — especially from older breaches — are sold dirt cheap.Sextortion scams are about snagging low-hanging fruit.

[+] radical thinkers using technology to protect privacy, but has now turned to buttoned-up business to fulfill his mission.","The day before Zooko Wilcox formally joined with a band of cryptographers to build a new anonymous cryptocurrency, he asked his then wife to leave her cell-phone behind—lest anyone listen in—and join him at a rocky outcropping overlooking Boulder, Colorado, where they lived. There, he shared his plans to help build a cryptocurrency that would be truly anonymous; unlike bitcoin, it would shield not only the names of users, but also the amounts spent, and other information that might later be used to identify them.Wilcox believed this new cryptocurrency, which came to be known as zcash, would be a boon to citizens of oppressive and intrusive regimes such as those in China, North Korea and Syria. But he understood it might also prove attractive to hitmen, drug dealers and child pornographers looking to evade detection. The cost of making anonymity available to upstanding members of the public was making it available to the less savory as well, he figured.“I told her, ‘I’ve decided to do this,’” recalls Wilcox, now 45. “‘It’s scary. I might end up in jail. I might get murdered or extorted. I might go broke. I might be sort of crushed by it somehow. But it’s way too important not to do.’”Three years later, on October 28, 2016, Wilcox and a team of cryptographers, followed a series of steps to mine the genesis block and bring zcash to life. Several hand-selected participants were trusted to hold a separate part of the creation key. Afterwards, to obscure the origins of the cryptocurrency and prevent counterfeits, each obliterated their part of the key. One even donned a gas mask and set fire to his computer. While destroying their keys, the founders retained something valuable: every time zcash was mined a residual was paid to for-profit Electric Coin Company, with Wilcox as its well-paid CEO. For a time, their crypto-creation thrived. By January 2018 zcash was valued as high as $750, with an average of $50 million worth of the crypto trading a day. That month however, zcash took a double hit. A bubble in the global cryptocurrency market started to pop and Japanese cryptocurrency exchange CoinCheck was hacked, losing $500 million of a cryptocurrency called XEM.  No, zcash didn’t have anything to do directly with the hack. But earlier that month, cryptocurrency investigation firm Chainalysis had identified a rise in zcash use for criminal activity, and rumors began to spread that if the CoinCheck thieves wanted to spend their booty, they’d have to launder it using zcash or another privacy-protecting cryptocurrency. By June, citing regulatory pressure, CoinCheck delisted zcash (ZEC) monero (XMR), augur (REP), and dash (DASH), prompting other big Japanese and South Korean cryptocurrency exchanges to delist the currencies.Unable to shake the rumors, last year Wilcox did something that might seem out of character for a self-described cypherpunk: he hired the Rand Corporation, the storied non-profit consulting firm and think tank that last year did $374 million of work for state and federal agencies, most prominently the Department of Defense. Wilcox asked Rand to investigate how widely cryptocurrencies generally, and zcash specifically, were being used for criminal activities. As part of the deal, Electric Coin stipulated that Rand’s full report would be made public, no matter what it turned up. Today, Rand published all 65 pages of its unredacted findings, concluding that “while privacy coins may intuitively appear likely to be preferred by malicious actors due to their purported anonymity-preserving features, there is little evidence to substantiate this claim.”   The research firm started by consulting what the report calls “informant interviewees,” including Antoine Martin, senior vice-president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and David Jevans, CEO of CipherTrace to get a high level understanding of where to look and what to look for.  Guided in part by those interviews, it then used proprietary software called the Rand Dark Web Observatory (DWO) to scan the eight largest dark markets and through a process known as scraping, gathered information on the kinds of goods being sold, the currencies being accepted and the kinds of conversations taking place in public chat rooms. The DWO found less than 1% of the illegal and illicit offerings that mentioned cryptocurrency even accepted zcash. By contrast, 59% accepted bitcoin, 27% accepted monero, 12% accepted ether, and 1% accepted litecoin. Moreover, nearly half of all dark market zcash mentions were from a single vendor called The Shop, which mentioned the cryptocurrency 161 times. “We didn't find any significant evidence that the zcash was used for illicit activities, but also as we know, that doesn't mean that zcash isn't at all used for illicit activity,” says senior Rand Europe analyst, Erik Silfversten. “We have to look at technology as a neutral, that it could be used for a wide variety of applications, and then we have to look at the actual evidence.”While privacy coins like monero and zcash are widely believed to be the currencies of choice for ... [+] criminals, the much more easy to trace bitcoin reigns supreme.Wilcox believes the Rand report demonstrates anonymous transactions aren’t the same as illicit ones and that ordinary, upstanding people value privacy.  “It sets a bad precedent if we fail and everyone takes the lesson that the governments of the world won't tolerate privacy and freedom and diversity and decentralization,”  he says. “That would set a bad precedent that would deter other important innovations that humanity needs to combat all of the threats to our whole civilization.”How did the zcash co-founder come to believe in both anonymous cryptocurrency and Rand? Born Bryce Wilcox in Phoenix, Arizona in May 1974, he moved to Texas at five when his engineer father was hired by Texas Instruments to help develop the TI 99/4, one of the first home computers. Ron Wilcox brought home one of these rudimentary machines for Bryce and his younger brother, Nathan, to play with, set it up in a closet and turned them loose.At first, all the brothers did was type nonsense in Beginners All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code (BASIC), the default language on the computer. Then he started to learn Logo—a program that was part computer language, part painting program and designed specifically for kids. “You could make colorful shapes and then you could script them to fly around the screen and change and animate and bounce off of each other,’’ he recalls. Back then, home computers were rare. Having one, and more importantly, knowing how to use it, became a huge part of Wilcox’ self-image. “To me, it was magic,’’ he says. Before Wilcox turned nine, his father moved to TI’s defense business in Colorado Springs. With a father in the defense industry, and cold-war tensions between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R in the news, Wilcox grew up believing  “we would probably all die in an Armageddon-like nuclear war with the evil empire,’’ he says. Yet he also started exploring a more-hopeful world, as he discovered bulletin board services, which allowed geeks to communicate via their computers before the first web-browser. So when the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, it made a big impression on the then-teenaged Wilcox. “I thought, like actually a lot of better-informed people also thought during those years, that the fall of the wall heralded the end of history, the end of war, and of national borders serving as walls trapping people,” he says. “And it was with that mindset that when I discovered the internet a couple of years later, I was extremely excited that I thought this was part of the pattern, that the internet was the end of national borders serving as walls preventing people from communicating.”This naturally led Wilcox into the nascent cypherpunk movement, where, in the spirit of privacy prevalent in the community, he adopted a pseudonym, Zooko, and engaged with people from all over the world who like him, didn’t quite fit in where they came from, but were at home with ones and zeros. “I felt like I was coming home to my people for the first time,” he says. He also learned that pseudonyms like Zooko stick.The cypherpunks’ focus on privacy was growing. In 1992, cryptographer David Chaum shared his ideas for an “untraceable electronic cash” with the Cypherpunk Mailing List—a hodge-podge of thinkers Wilcox compares to a debate club.  A year later mathematician Eric Hughes published the Cypherpunk’s Manifesto, connecting privacy to concern over government surveillance, and famously declared that “Cypherpunks write code,” meaning they did more than just think about privacy.That same year, Wilcox joined the mailing list. There he met Tim May, author of the Crypto-Anarchist Manifesto and Wei Dai, an inventor of an early cryptocurrency called b-money. He also started reading the contributions of WikiLeaks creator Julian Assange. These ideas, combined with the fall of the Berlin Wall made him believe for the first time that technology could further break-down borders. “I was inspired to imagine technological developments having social impact,” he says. “That technology would change how whole human communities interacted with each other.”By 1996, Wilcox had dropped out of college at the University of Colorado at Boulder and taken his first job in cryptocurrency—as a shopping cart maintainer for DigiCash, Chaum’s early creation. DigiCash was centralized, meaning Chaum’s company had control over the minting process, and it never really took off. Wilcox concluded from that experience that if he could figure out how to make electronic cash that didn’t require a middle-man, he could crack the code to build a private economy without borders. (Wilcox earned his computer science degree in 1998.)Zooko Wilcox and Amber O'Hearn were married less than a year after they met in what she calls a ""mad ... [+] love affair"" that lasted 15 years. They are still friends.In 1999, at the Financial Cryptography conference in Anguilla, Wilcox met Amber O’Hearn. The following year, they were married, taking on the “Wilcox-O’Hearn” hyphenate for their last name. “Life and romance were intimately connected to our passions about math and cryptography and engineering and about economics and social influences,” says O’Hearn.  Meanwhile, Wilcox was becoming an entrepreneur. In 2000, he launched Mojo Nation, a progenitor to BitTorrent, which lets users share files without a central authority. While Mojo Nation closed after just a few years, it incorporated features that would later show up in bitcoin, including “tokenization”  or the digital representation of unique objects. Then, on October 31, 2008, someone or some group of people using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto published a paper describing bitcoin as a “peer-to-peer electronic cash system” on the same Cryptography Mailing List Wilcox had joined. “I tried to invent some way to make a decentralized version of DigiCash and I couldn't figure out how to do it. So I'd almost given up and almost started to think the laws of computer science had, for some reason, made it impossible to have decentralized money. And then I found out that bitcoin was working,” he says.In those early days, Nakamoto was still working on the code, and Wilcox threw in his two-cents, finding a bug early on that would have let hackers create copies, or forks, of the bitcoin blockchain. Wilcox bought his first bitcoin in early 2011 and by September seemed to be a true believer, tweeting that he’d like some Nobel economics prize winners to tell him why bitcoin, at $4.50, was a bad investment. That same year he founded Least Authority, a security audit firm designed to help clients ensure they aren’t leaking private information into the public. By then, Wilcox’s reputation in the cryptography community was so strong that Andrew Miller, a grad student studying virtual reality at the University of Central Florida, suspected he might really be Satoshi Nakamoto.  Miller joined a chat group for Least Authority intending to surreptitiously prove that Wilcox was bitcoin’s creator and ended up exchanging cryptographic lessons with him instead. Importantly, Wilcox credits Miller for introducing him to zk-snarks, an implementation of zero-knowledge proofs that allow a person to prove they know something without needing to reveal the details about what they know or how they got there. Now an assistant professor of computer science at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign Miller compares the idea, which is crucial to how zcash operates, to punching a pinhole into a piece of black paper and placing the hole over Waldo in a Where’s Waldo puzzle, proving you know where the beanie-capped character is without revealing anything else about his context. “I don't think of myself as a pioneer, like Satoshi,” says Wilcox. “I think of myself as somewhat more of a conduit for other people's inventions, including Satoshi's.” Begrudgingly, Miller reached the same conclusion. Wilcox’s relationship with Miller did, however, prove consequential, setting him on his path to zcash. In 2013, cryptographer Ian Miers presented a paper at the Bitcoin Conference in San Jose with the idea for zerocoin, an upgrade to bitcoin that would erase the trail of publicly available addresses, making the cryptocurrency truly anonymous. But bitcoin core developer Peter Todd stood up from the audience and said, “Zerocoin isn’t coming anytime soon to bitcoin.”So Miers and his coauthors approached Wilcox to jointly build the anonymous currency.  At first, Wilcox turned them down, preferring to focus on building Least Authority. But Miller, who knew about the work of Miers’ team, convinced Wilcox to reconsider, saying he himself would quit his PhD studies to join the project if both Wilcox and Miers’ collaborator Matthew Green got involved. “It was at that moment that I finally made up my mind that I was gonna do it,” says Wilcox.That’s when Wilcox took O’Hearn, sans cell phone, to that cliff overlooking Boulder, to discuss what he was about to become involved in.  “I don't think he was asking my permission,” says O’Hearn, who has three children with Wilcox. “But he wanted me to know that he was taking on something that could be considered dangerous politically and could have consequences that could take him away from me and the family.” While the pair divorced in 2015, she says she supported, and still supports, that decision. Matthew Green describes the birth of the zcash team this way: “I remember thinking `Zooko’s the only person I know who’s crazy enough to take this project on.’” Slowly, the zerocoin whitepaper started to evolve into a protocol for minting a new kind of cryptocurrency called the zerocash protocol, then just zcash. While zcash was initially conceived as a more private sidechain to bitcoin, the team, now formally operating as the Electric Coin Company, opted for an entirely separate currency.At the time it was becoming increasingly popular to do what is called a “pre-mine” where the cryptocurrency is created all at once and either sold (the way Ripple sold its eponymous cryptocurrency) or “air-dropped” with people who already own a cryptocurrency given the same amount of another cryptocurrency (as happened when bitcoin cash was created).  But pre-mines run the risk of being branded unlicensed securities offerings and air-drops reward those who are already crypto-rich.“Why don't you just give some zcash to all U.S. dollar holders?"" Wilcox recalls Miller asking. “And I was like, ‘What? I don't wanna reward the rich owners of U.S. dollars with more zcash.’” To which Miller replied: ""Yeah, and I don't respect the money of the bitcoiners anymore than I respect the money of the U.S. dollars holders."" Electric Coin opted for a third way, where 20% of the zcash mined went to support the developers of the technology, including Wilcox. In July 2018 Wilcox disclosed—to some backlash from  the crypto community—that he had received 2,033 zcash per month, then worth about $300,000 or $3.6 million annually. (At today’s price of about $45, that would be worth about $1 million.)The ECC now employs 30 people, not counting the non-profit Zcash Foundation that also helps oversee the development of the code. And in November, a new revenue sharing model kicks in;  miners will still receive 80% of zcash mined, but 8% will go to a pool for grants to third parties other than ECC or the Zcash Foundation.  ECC will receive 7% and the Zcash Foundation will receive 5%. At today’s zcash price, that’s about $390,000 per month for grants, $345,000 per month to ECC and $246,000 per month to the foundation. The zcash outstanding is now collectively valued at just $400 million. In spite of being delisted on several of the largest exchanges, zcash is still available on dozens of exchanges, including Coinbase and Gemini, two U.S. exchanges that pride themselves in being compliant with government regulations. Today, while zcash can be used on markets like Toffee.com to buy software that makes it look like a computer is in a different jurisdiction, it can also be used on Andreessen Horowitz-backed Haven, to buy prosaic stuff like clothing, cars, books and computers. Payments apps Flexa and Gemini added zcash last year, allowing users to spend the cryptocurrency at Barnes & Noble, Bed Bath & Beyond and Whole Foods. Still, the image of zcash as a haven for those concerned with privacy remains. The Human Rights Foundation and the Electronic Frontier Foundation have both received zcash donations. And a Syrian refugee in England tells Forbes he uses zcash to surreptitiously pay an employee in Syria. Over the first quarter of 2020 the zcash market value increased by 27%, according to a CoinMarketCap report, making it the fifth fastest growing cryptocurrency, behind dash, another privacy preserving technology. And Wilcox hasn’t given up on restoring zcash’s place on the big Japanese exchanges. He says the self-regulatory Japan Virtual Currency Exchange Association agreed in advance that  Rand would be considered a suitable third-party investigator. The Electric Coin Company says it gave the Rand report to the association in April and a company rep characterizes its response as “very positive.” The regulator told Forbes it wasn’t able to comment on its regulatory activities, adding, “We have had a variety of documents and materials through the course of our daily research activities.” A break down of goods available in exchange for cryptocurrencies, including but not limited to ... [+] zcash.Regardless, the Rand report raises a big question. Why aren’t criminals making more use of zcash given its privacy protecting properties? Rand says it doesn’t know but did offer a number of possible explanations. Perhaps zcash has been successfully branded as a way for law-abiding citizens to transact anonymously online or maybe would-be criminals don’t trust or understand its encryption technology. One possible irony: by drawing increased attention to the use of zcash for anonymous transactions, could the report actually entice more criminals to use it?"

Coinbase reports that the total stablecoin market capitalization has risen to an all-time-high of over $9 billion. On-chain value transfers of USD Coin (USDC) have recently reached all-time-highs of nearly $400 million per day. On top of this, one of  the most hyped stablecoin projects, Libra, seems to be moving forward with its updated whitepaper v2. If Libra succeeds, stablecoins backed by several fiat currencies will be released to the circulation with potentially immediate mass global adoption.","Stablecoin Market CapitalizationAs the name suggests, stablecoins are designed to have a fixed price not affected by market forces. This is often achieved by tying each unit of a stablecoin to a fiat currency or an underlying asset. For example, stablecoins like USDC and GUSD are pegged to US dollars. Stablecoins like Dai are backed by a basket of cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins are extremely important to the crypto ecosystem because they allow holding digital value shielded from the volatility of other cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, as well as transfer of stable value between exchanges. By combining price stability with other beneficial characteristics of cryptocurrencies (high security, low transaction fees, and programmability), stablecoins appear to be driving the next wave of growth for the crypto industry and its verticals.From a tax perspective, there are no distinct rules applicable to stablecoins; stablecoins are treated as “property” under IRS Notice 2014-21, similar to any other cryptocurrency like bitcoin and ether.Although stablecoins are praised for maintaining steady prices, the concept is not perfect yet. In practice, it's extremely difficult to achieve a perfect 1:1 ratio between stablecoin and the underlying fiat currency, leading to some unfavorable tax outcomes under “property” tax treatment. For example, let’s say you receive 1,000 USDC at $1.00 each. You then spend 1,000 USDC to buy bitcoin. At the time you spend the 1,000 USDC, the value of 1 USDC is $1.02. This would result in $2 (1,000*($1.02 - $1.00)) of capital gains under current tax rules. While stablecoins are meant to be completely pegged to fiat, these slight fluctuations in price from one exchange to the next can result in unintended taxes.Further, this tax treatment also puts an unnecessary burden on stablecoin users to track cost basis and figure out fair market value each time they dispose of coins leading to unintended bottlenecks. Consequently, it is reasonable to think that stablecoins should be exempted from taxation because they do not work as a speculative asset, and the unintended minor gains/losses are immaterial.   Recently,the controversial topic of stablecoin taxes was brought up at the IRS Virtual Currency Summit held in Washington DC in March, 2020. While some argue that taxing stablecoins doesn’t make sense because they aren’t speculative assets, unfortunately, until more specific guidance is issued to address stablecoins, they are subject to generic “property” taxation and will result in capital gains taxes.Disclaimer: this post is informational only and is not intended as tax advice.

If you’re an active cryptocurrency investor, you may have received one of these in the mail or electronically. A 1099-K is very different from the customary 1099-B you would receive from a typical stock brokerage detailing your investing activity. In my work as the co-founder of a cryptocurrency tax platform, I’ve found that from a tax reporting perspective, 1099-K is useless. This is because it does not help the taxpayer report their capital gains and losses from cryptocurrency investing activity.What’s the purpose of a 1099?All 1099 forms serve the same general purpose: to report certain types of nonemployment-related income to the IRS. Form 1099-K is no different in this regard, and cryptocurrency exchanges send out two copies of the form: one to the qualifying customer, and one to the IRS. This gives the IRS information on who has cryptocurrency-related income that should be getting reported on their tax return.So what’s the problem?The fundamental problem is 1099-K does not report gains and losses to the customer; it only reports gross proceeds. The gross proceeds figure is the total amount you have transacted on an exchange in U.S. dollars. However, when it comes to completing your taxes, gross proceeds do not matter — gains and losses do.In other words, a 1099-K form will not help you with your cryptocurrency capital gains and losses tax reporting. But yes, it will alert the government that you have crypto-related income that needs to be reported.Why can’t my exchange give me a 1099-B instead?This would definitely make tax reporting easier for consumers. Unfortunately, exchanges fundamentally do not have the ability to give their users complete and accurate 1099-B forms.Why is this? Simply put, cryptocurrency exchanges do not always have the cost basis information for your cryptocurrency transactions (buys, sells, trades). Your cost basis is simply the amount it cost you to acquire the asset. If you paid $5,000 for 1 bitcoin, your cost basis in that bitcoin is $5,000. Cost basis information is needed to issue a complete 1099-B. Cryptocurrency exchanges, and all crypto-native companies, can’t report cost basis information because of the transferability that exists with cryptocurrencies like bitcoin.For example, I can send my bitcoin that I bought on one exchange to a different wallet for storage. From that wallet, I can send it to a different cryptocurrency exchange to sell any time I want. These types of transfers happen all the time, and they make it impossible for any single crypto exchange or company to know the cost basis of a user’s assets at any given time.This is the fundamental reason crypto exchanges struggle to give out 1099-Bs: They don’t have the complete cost basis information. This is also why cryptocurrency exchanges are fundamentally different from typical stock brokerages, which usually have all cost basis information on hand.What’s the solution?The solution to this capital gains and losses tax reporting problem is for crypto investors to simply aggregate their transactions from all of their cryptocurrency exchanges and platforms into one unit of record. When the data from all platforms is in one location, cost basis information can be tracked — even in spite of the transfers.These market dynamics have fueled entrepreneurs to develop cryptocurrency tax software companies in an effort to tackle and solve this problem. Cryptocurrency investors can choose from a variety of tax software options and then leverage their chosen software to import all of their transactions across all of the platforms where they buy, sell and store crypto. They can then generate necessary capital gains and losses tax reports based on this data.Will future 1099 requirements be passed by the IRS?There is little doubt that the IRS will be passing future 1099 information reporting requirements. Cryptocurrency exchanges will be forced to adhere to these future requirements if they wish to continue operating within the U.S. market. It is my hope that the IRS will take its time to truly understand how the fundamentals of cryptocurrency work before it passes any legislation.The information provided here is not investment, tax or financial advice.

For COVID-19 Stimulus Payments",https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonbrett/2020/05/02/congress-urges-treasury-secretary-mnuchin-to-use-blockchain-for-covid-19-stimulus-payments/,,"<div class=""content-data light-text""><span class=""hidden pageviews-wrapper""></span><time>May 2, 2020,</time><span class=""time""><time>04:39pm EDT</time></span></div>","On Tuesday, a letter from eleven Members of Congress to the Secretary of the Treasury was made public that urged Secretary Mnuchin to consider the use of blockchain technology to help in providing COVID-19 stimulus checks to Americans. With the high-profile nature of suggesting the U.S. Treasury could deliver money owed to the public with both speed and security as a result of using blockchain technology is the equivalent of the ‘Super Bowl’ of blockchain use cases for the private sector. ","The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) was signed into law on March 27, 2020 and provided for payments; however, timely delivery of the money to all who are entitled to the stimulus has proved a challenge. While 90 of the 150 million eligible individuals have received their payments as of April 17, the 60 million that remain include low-income families who do not normally file income tax returns and face issues with accessing basic financial services. WASHINGTON, DC - APRIL 21: Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin speaks as U.S. President Donald Trump ... [+] looks on during the daily coronavirus task force briefing at the White House on April 21, 2020 in Washington, DC. Earlier in the day, the president met with New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo in the Oval Office to discuss COVID-19 testing. (Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images)The letter urges Treasury to ‘...utilize private sector innovations such as blockchain and DLT to support the necessary functions of government to distribute and track relief programs and direct that all guidance support the use of technology to facilitate delivery of CARES Act benefits.’ The letter was spearheaded by Congressman Darren Soto (D-FL), Co-Chair of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus, as well as fellow Co-Chairs Congressman Tom Emmer (R-MN) and Congressman David Schweikert (R-AZ). Additional signers include Congressman Ted Budd (R-NC), Congressman Warren Davidson (R-OH), Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI), Congressman Anthony Gonzalez (R-OH), Congressman Ro Khanna (D-CA), Congressman Ben McAdams (D-UT), Congressman Bill Posey (R-FL), and Delegate Stacey Plaskett (D-U.S. Virgin Islands). Delegate Plaskett is the first African-American woman to join the Congressional Blockchain Caucus last year. The letter also addresses the need to stay competitive with China. Urging the Administration to promote blockchain technology is not new to Congressman Soto, who was part of a bi-partisan letter in July of 2019 to the Larry Kudlow, Chair of the National Economic Council in the White House. That letter urged the White House to take action on numerous fronts with blockchain, stating, ‘To continue its standing as a world leader in technological innovation, the United States should engage with policymakers, the private sector, and academia to promote the research and development of blockchain technology; explore its benefits for private and public use; collaborate on cross-sectoral policy, standard-setting, scalability, and implementation issues; and discuss potential regulatory approaches.’  The Policy Leap From Bitcoin To Blockchain President Donald Trump, during the hearings over Facebook’s potential Libra cryptocurrency, made his first public comments on bitcoin: Donald Trump on Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies. Treasury Secretary Mnuchin went on to explain his reservations on crypto when he stated, ‘I want to be careful that anybody who’s using bitcoin — regardless of what the price is — is using it for proper purposes and not illicit purposes...And there are billions of dollars of transactions going on in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for illicit purposes’. However, Blockchain, a technology that enables the peer-to-peer transactions for cryptocurrency, has been explored around the world by major companies on how to process faster payments and save on processing costs. Forbes produces a list of enterprises known as the ‘Blockchain 50’, that encompasses ‘enterprises embracing the technology underlying cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and using it to speed up business processes, increase transparency and potentially save billions of dollars’. China, who recently announced its own ‘National Blockchain’, implements a very different policy toward cryptocurrency than it does for blockchain. While many times China looks to restrain the use of private cryptocurrencies, the country’s ambitious view of blockchain is such that numerous resources are provided to help accelerate the growth of this technology. While not much has been heard about blockchain from the Administration yet, hopefully there will be the ability to understand the distinction and not have blockchain be conflated with the idea of bitcoin or lose focus on how many in the private sector believe blockchain can be used to help accelerate delivery of stimulus checks under the CARES Act. Roger Brown, Head of Tax & Regulatory Affairs for Lukka, a firm offering an advanced virtual currency tax preparation program, noted, ‘Blockchain utilization serves as a compelling way for people to receive their stimulus checks as there are a myriad of scams present that deny the vulnerable from receiving aid.’ Erick Pinos, the Americas Ecosystem Lead at Ontology, a high performance public blockchain and distributed collaboration platform, notes, ‘ Blockchain allows for the fast and secure transfer of money from one individual to another for a very low fee and without the need for an intermediary. In a nutshell, blockchain-based payments do not require the sender or the user to have access to a bank account,’ said Pinos. Alex Mashinsky of Celsius, a crypto lending platform, noted that blockchain is still in its infancy, stating, ‘There is not a blockchain anywhere in the world,’ that is ready to handle such an undertaking as the delivery of COVID-19 payments. For those who do not normally file tax returns, the U.S. Treasury has offered a remedy to receive their money on the IRS website. However, the online method involves providing your name, address, and a bank routing and account number - the last of which is sometimes a major hurdle as low-income families tend to be either unbanked or underbanked and may not have a bank account. Therefore, it is reasonable to foresee continued pressure from Congress on the White House and Treasury to find ways to deliver these COVID-19 checks to those most in need in a timely way and to bring the most sophisticated payments technologies to bear. The letter is below and dated April 23 and was made public April 28. "

Now, as the economic reality of a post-coronavirus world sinks in, Trump and the Fed are edging closer to negative interest rates—something legendary investor Warren Buffett has warned could have ""extreme consequences.""U.S. president Donald Trump has previously indicated negative interest rates are a ... [+] possibility--though so far the Federal Reserve has demurred from taking rates below zero in order to protect the country's banking system. Negative interest rates, meaning borrowers are paid to take out loans by the lender, have been adopted by a number of central banks around the world, led by some European central banks and the Bank of Japan. If a central bank sets its overnight deposit rate to below zero, lenders must pay their central bank to hold their reserves. Banks could then pass those costs on to their customers, charging fees for positive balances.Some economists believe negative interest rates can jolt life into flatlining economies, encouraging money to be invested or spent, though others fear a negative interest rate policy could keep an economy subdued.""We're doing things that we don't know [their] ultimate outcome,"" Buffett said when asked about the possibility of negative interest rates in the U.S. at Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting on Saturday. ""[Negative interest rates are] probably the most interesting question that I've seen in economics,"" Buffett said, speaking to shareholders via webcast and warning of ""extreme consequences"" if a negative interest rate policy is brought in.Back in March, Buffett said the puzzle of what negative interest rates would do to U.S. financial markets is ""the most important question in the world,"" admitting he doesn't ""know the answer.""Earlier this year, Trump indicated he'd be in favour of the Fed adopting negative interest rates in order to compete with countries that already have. ""We’re forced to compete with nations that are getting negative rates, something very new,"" Trump told attendees at the World Economic Forum in January. ""Meaning, they get paid to borrow money, something I could get used to very quickly.""While Fed chair Jerome Powell has said he doesn't think negative interest rates are ""an appropriate policy,"" Trump isn't shy about applying pressure. ""The Federal Reserve should get our interest rates down to zero, or less,"" Trump tweeted in September. ""It is only the naïveté of Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve that doesn’t allow us to do what other countries are already doing,"" Trump said, calling Fed policy makers ""boneheads.""Meanwhile, Narayana Kocherlakota, a former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis has thrown his weight behind negative interest rates, calling for the Fed to set interest rates a ""quarter percentage point below zero"" and put employment above bank stability. ""Put crudely, the Fed is giving up on unemployment reductions to help keep banks and their shareholders safer,"" Kocherlakota wrote in a Bloomberg op-ed. The Fed opted to keep interest rates on hold at its latest policy meeting last week, though Powell said he is willing to go further to prop up the economy ravaged by lockdowns. ""It may well be the case that the economy needs more support,"" Powell said, speaking at a press conference after the Fed's two-day policy meeting—leaving negative interest rates on the table but keeping them at arm's length for now. ""One of the things [the Fed] wants to do is protect the banking system,"" William Lee, chief economist at the California-based economic think tank Milken Institute, told CNBC this weekend. ""We've learned our lesson from Japan and the Europeans; when you go to negative rates you start impairing the banking system. I think [negative interest rates] will be the last tool the Fed pulls out of its tool kit. The Fed right now is oriented toward ensuring financial markets work and work properly and stay working.""Donald Trump's support for negative interest rates puts him at odds with Fed chair Jerome Powell. Last month, a senior official at the International Monetary Fund warned the Bank of Japan against pushing rates deeper into negative territory, cautioning it would ""provide fairly limited economic stimulus while negative rates may weaken profitability in parts of the financial sector.""Coronavirus-induced lockdowns have caused central bankers and policy makers to go further and move faster than ever before, pushing some toward alternatives, such as bitcoin, a cryptocurrency. Many bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchanges around the world have reported a surge in users and trading volumes over the last couple of months. Talk of negative interest rates in the U.S. come as bitcoin is on the verge of its third supply squeeze—something many crypto proponents think is likely to boost the bitcoin price. ""The world economy just experienced a crisis that highlighted the risk of insufficient cash balances, and now policy makers want to further penalize cash balances with the use of negative interest rates. Why? To try to create a short-term increase in spending and investing ahead of the November election,"" said Pierre Rochard, bitcoin strategist at bitcoin and crypto exchange Kraken.""Bitcoin has the opposite approach of incentivizing long term savings with seizure-resistance and volatile hyperdeflation.""Bitcoin's looming supply squeeze, called a halving, is set for May 12 and will see the number of bitcoin rewarded to those that maintain the bitcoin network, known as miners, halved.""The halvening is an important event for bitcoin, but it’s just one element in the perfect storm that bitcoin is enjoying at the moment,"" said Alex Mashinsky, chief executive of cryptocurrency lending platform Celsius Network. ""Governments around the world are implementing unprecedented fiscal stimulus, which risks causing high inflation across fiat currencies, which reinforces bitcoin’s value proposition as a deflationary asset. As a result, many first time retail investors are flocking to bitcoin as a way to protect their wealth.""The Oracle of Omaha, Warren Buffett, who's previously branded bitcoin ""probably rat poison squared,"" told Berkshire Hathaway shareholders the coronavirus pandemic could have an ""extraordinarily wide"" range of possible outcomes.A severely weakened U.S. banking system—potentially leading to a bitcoin and cryptocurrency adoption spike—is one coronavirus outcome that even Buffett might have missed."

However, one crypto innovator looks back all the way to 1971 when the U.S. went off the gold standard to explain how we got here. And, at a time when many policymakers in D.C. consider alternatives to our current monetary policy during these unprecedented times, this entrepreneur is armed with a PowerPoint presentation almost 70 pages in length to support his arguments.","Alex Mashinsky, founder and CEO of Celsius Network, offers customers the ability to earn decent interest on bitcoin, gold and other cryptocurrency, get a cash loan using crypto as collateral, and make payments on the blockchain. As stated on the website, ‘With Celsius Network you can unbank yourself,’ describing their attractive banking alternative to traditional banks, including global financial institutions like JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo.Alex Mashinsky, chief executive officer of Celsius Network, speaks during the Milken Institute ... [+] Global Conference in Beverly Hills, California. U.S. Photographer: Dania Maxwell/BloombergMashinsky points out how the Federal Reserve, by lowering its interest rates to near zero, offers an unlimited amount of zero percent loans to large banks who offer credit cards during COVID-19. At the same time, these banks are raising their already high credit card interest rates even higher on tens of millions of unemployed Americans. He refers to Adam Smith’s Wealth of Nations when describing how the ‘invisible hand’ is stealing from the pockets of everyday working Americans in order to highlight the absurdity of monetary policy that benefits the large corporates and bankers rather than the most vulnerable part of our economy. Three things I learned that I did not know before my interview are that:1) Mashinsky sees capitalism and the U.S. Fed as being in decline since 1971 when we went off the gold standard;2) He does not suggest for monetary policy that we ‘reinstate’ the gold standard, but rather instead sees a money race between central bank digital dollar, corporate digital currencies such as that proposed by Facebook, and global ‘Internet’ money that is a zero sum game that will only have one global winner; 3) According to Mashinsky, gold has never been able to accrue interest for its owners in the past 5,000 years until now with Celsius Network, which pays 4% interest in gold on gold. Jason Brett: I realize there is a lot going on for your company, but would like to dive into monetary policy and fiscal policy discussions for crypto and blockchain as well to get your opinion. Alex Mashinsky: Sure, you can just listen to Powell, he has all the answers. You don’t need my opinion...Brett: What is your take on the current policy of the Federal Reserve and the direction taken by Fed Chair Powell during this economic crisis? Mashinsky: Let me give you the long version of the answer because I think the answer goes back to 1971. That’s when we went off the gold standard. That’s also when the microprocessor was invented, and since then we basically have had four or five recessions, and if you were in the financial or tech sector, you almost didn’t feel any of the downturns. The Fed reflated your assets every time you got in trouble and you did better and better after every cycle. On the other hand the average American’s income has basically stagnated since 1971 while tech and finance did exceptionally well. So really, all this GDP that we are talking about was created through financial engineering either by creating these crazy valuations for tech companies or by banks leveraging free money that the Fed created for them while Americans lost their life savings due to inflation and monetary debasement.In the last month, the Fed printed more money than it did in the last one hundred years. We are moving in to a Keynesian Modern Economic Theory on steroids. We need to stop and go back to Austrian Economic Theory which relies on savings and no monetary intervention. When you put [this type of monetary policy] in the context of the new digital dollar, the main question is are you creating something that has limited supply, or are you just converting printing money on a Fed balance sheet by just adding zeros to a Fed spreadsheet with a new dollar that will just be in digital form? The big difference between Bitcoin and any digital fiat currency that runs on a blockchain [is that] the Chinese or American [central banks] are not going to put a cap on the amount that can be printed. So really the Blockchain has no purpose there; it is just a way to validate who has what. It does not have limited supply, nor is going to cure our illness of trying to print ourselves out of trouble. Brett: Based on ideas that have been publicly embraced by the former Presidential Candidate Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) as well as Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), a theory called Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) has gained a following, where Congress would print, or mint, two trillion dollar platinum coins in Treasury. MMT states because the U.S. dollar is backed by its full faith and credit, the U.S. can print as much of its own sovereign money as it wants to pay off its debts. This theory shifts the responsibility of Fiscal policy to the U.S. Treasury. What do you think should be the role of monetary policy by Government? If there were a ‘crypto’ monetary policy, what would it be? Federal Reserve Building in Washington, DCMashinsky: Since the 2008 Recession, we were told, especially by Republicans, it is not the American way to put a safety net under the average worker or the average company. The good companies will survive and the bad ones will fail. They held onto that in a very stern way. After all, we’ve given AIG $200 billion to bail out the financial system. In the last month between the Fed and fiscal policy, we committed to print 10 trillion dollars over that same period of time, so basically we have just proven again there is zero chance we will have any financial responsibility either by the Fed or the U.S. government. So I think creating a system at Treasury where we would have checks and balances would be a disaster for our children, and we already created a disaster for ourselves. The Fed has been drawing on the magic power of the dollar, ...[which] is the most powerful currency on the planet. No other fiat or crypto in the world can step in to replace the dollar. The Fed essentially is saying it can continue and debase the dollar and nothing is going to happen, and this is the justification to soften the coming recession and put a massive safety net under the entire U.S. economy. It doesn’t matter if you have a good company or not, or whether there is a recession or not, whoever is close to the politicians and banks is going to get most of this free money, not the people who really need it as we see on TV every day. Most recently, this has happened with big companies taking advantage of the small business loan program, who now say, sorry we didn’t hear that part, ‘we thought it was for everybody’. The crypto version of this bailout would be to focus all this borrowed money on the future America, on companies that enable domestic manufacturing and high tech industries like machine learning, Artificial Intelligence, and blockchain technology. Brett: With over 51,000 Bitcoin deposited to your network, what does that milestone mean to you? Central bank digital currency developers such as the Bank of England have concluded that Bitcoin is not money, as it is too volatile and not good for payments or store of value. What does it feel like to have achieved this milestone, and yet with central bankers suggesting Bitcoin is not money, why do your customers buy Bitcoin if it’s not really money? Bitcoin Mashinsky: Every Central Bank – there are 200 of them – is like a magician; they have a magic ability to create something out of nothing by just posting numbers and saying words. They are not bad institutions - they are needed by society but are mostly acting in the best interests of the very rich citizens or large companies. Today unfortunately, especially with zero percent interest rates and free loans to everyone who does not need them, what you are seeing is more and more of the central banks acting in the best interest of the one percent and not the 99 percent. We are focused on delivering high interest income on USD stable coins, 26 cryptocurrencies and Gold. We pay rates you cannot find on Wall Street.Saying Bitcoin is not great store of value is a complete and utter lie. It doesn’t matter if you take a one year, five year, or 10 year look, Bitcoin outperformed the dollar or bonds, and outperformed any other asset on the planet. There is not a single asset that can stand next to Bitcoin and say they did better than Bitcoin. The dollar is exceptional form of payment but horrible store of value, The dollar lost 99.99% of its value against Bitcoin in the past 11 years. Though Bitcoin is volatile, it has been the best asset class on the planet. These are facts, not an opinion. The dollar is a horrible store of value that deflates three percent every year.For the dollar to be an exceptional form of value, it would have to be a deflationary currency. Bitcoin is the only deflationary currency out there as its ‘monetary inflation’ is currently at 1.8% a year vs about 15% for the USD in 2020. That is the main advantage that bitcoin has because the amount of bitcoin to be created in the next 20 years is going to be dramatically less than the number of people joining and participating in the bitcoin economy.Having over 100,000 Users, and 51,000 in Bitcoin, that is a good start but is nothing in global monetary terms: the entire Bitcoin community is nothing compared to the larger banking community. Most of the population on the planet don’t even know what Bitcoin is, and of those that do, maybe one percent has tried to own or transact with this asset. Fiat currency in all its forms has started to fail all over the world, places like Venezuela, Turkey, Argentina, Lebanon, and Iran, and people have started to look to different alternatives. With COVID-19, we have seen everyone first run to the dollar. They waited a few weeks to see if it was safe to invest again. Some people went back to the stock market, some people went back to gold, and some people went to Bitcoin.Brett: What are your thoughts about whether consumers who make the transition into Bitcoin should have any consumer protections and regulations? Also, how are you able to pay such high interest on Bitcoin?Mashinsky: Our wallet is basically just like your banking app. It is the same thing. It is just an app that allows you to store value, earn interest, or take a loan – those are the basic functions that we do for digital assets. But unlike your bank, we have committed to always act in your best interest. We are not a broker or an exchange. I remember the Goldman Sachs CEO being asked in a Senate hearing if those they bank are customers; he responded that they were not customers but rather counter parties. If your bank is thinking of you as a counter party, they are not acting in your best interest. Celsius Network goes out to find the best yield for your asset with the lowest risk and then delivers 80% of the value created back to the user, not to the shareholders. No bank in the history of banking has ever done this where you will get 80% of what the bank makes on your money. If I am JP Morgan Chase, I have tens of millions of credit card customers, and I charge them 24% lending them money given to me for free by either the government or depositors. Even though my cost of capital went to zero, I didn’t lower my cost of credit card fees in years. How does Celsius Network work? We lend out and do all the functions banks do but with crypto-assets. Unlike most banks and financial institutions, I turn back the majority of my profits to my depositors. When you look at the yields that we pay, it looks too good to be true – that is the first thing people say because they got used to earn almost nothing on their deposits. We lend crypto to institutions and charge them interest. Instead of keeping 100% of it like banks do, we share 80% of these revenues with our customers. This equates to about 8% on USD assets and a four percent annualized interest rate for Bitcoin, based on us earning five percent on the assets you lend us. That’s the process and when you start from the point that you will act in the best interest of the customers, then it’s a very easy to bring new customers. But when you start from the point of extracting as much as you can, you end up like JPMorgan Chase or Wells Fargo. Brett: So with zero percent rates from the Federal Reserve…Mashinsky: Sorry to interrupt you, but these are basic questions that no one is asking. Banks used to pay five or six percent for your money, now they pay zero. Why haven’t they lowered the rates for charging interest on credit cards and loans? They are charging record rates – they have actually raised their rates and raised their fees. The audacity of doing that in a zero percent environment! They can go and borrow as much money as they want from the Fed with zero costs. Have you seen a single bank lower their credit card fees? That is the audacity, the stealing in the U.S. economy - a lot of people don’t understand the ‘invisible hand’ that is emptying our pockets. The history books will show how this is 2008 all over again, only this time we bailed out not just the ‘too big to fail’ banks, but also ‘too big to fail’ corporate giants who spent all of their fortunes rebuying their stocks and issuing dividends, and when they got into trouble, the average Joe and our children bailed them out. So my beef with the government and the Fed is that we have this amazing opportunity to reset our economy and focus on the future, but we insist on borrowing from our children to fix the past and spending precious new dollars to do so. Instead of investing in the future such as blockchain, AI, recreating the manufacturing base of the U.S., and breaking up the supply chains with China, we are bailing out the casino companies, airlines, and cruise companies.The chain with data. 3D illustrationBrett: Last year, Congress wrote a letter to Larry Kudlow, Chair of the National Economic Council at the White House, asking for more attention to be paid to blockchain. Now, another letter has been written in which 11 Congress members asked Mnuchin to look at the private sector and blockchain for COVID-19 economic stimulus payments. With explaining the difference between Bitcoin and blockchain, and then Facebook’s Libra, how do we explain to our policymakers the importance of this technology to stay ahead of China, and what Bitcoin or Blockchain even is? Mashinsky: Today there is no blockchain technology that can take the Fed or Treasury’s money and deliver it in a digital wallet properly to all Americans. China recently gave over one billion people airdropped money through Alipay and WeChat pay and it worked marvelously in their centralized system. For the U.S., it is not about missing the whole Blockchain wave, it is about rebuilding the U.S. infrastructure based on decentralization and open ledgers. Yes, China is working on a crypto fiat currency, and we should have a solution for that as well, and it is going to take a few years to develop but that is not what this race is all about.So, the issue here is that we have ‘three horses’ in the monetary race to create the future of money: government-sponsored unlimited supply coin, corporate-sponsored permissioned-based blockchain Libra, or an open blockchain (what Bitcoin is) and what DeFi is and Celsius is. We can continue pumping the Keynesian supply model bubble, or the corporate supply economics model. If you pick the wrong horse here, the dollar ends up falling off a cliff. The world economy is going to adopt one solution to replace the old USD. Brett: How exactly does the gold that offers interest by Celsius Network work? Mashinsky: We partnered with Tether Gold which holds physical gold you can buy in Switzerland. You are issued a digital token representing the gold which you can deposit in our wallet. We pay you interest in kind and you can redeem these tokens for physical gold. We make money by rehypothecating the gold or borrowing against it. Brett: Is the primary regulator the FCA of the United Kingdom, and are you considered a ‘challenger bank’? Mashinsky: We are not considered a bank in any of the countries we operate in as in most of them Bitcoin and other assets are defined as commodities. Since we pay interest in kind it’s like depositing digital sugar with us and getting paid more sugar for storing it with us. Brett: Are your services available to anyone in the U.S.? Mashinsky: Different services are available in different states. For example, it took us 2 years to launch interest on Bitcoin in New York State as we had to partner with a custodian that was acceptable to the NYS regulator Department of Financial Services.Brett: Thank you for your time."

These technology-driven changes, which mainly include the high use of cryptocurrencies and the use of secured browser technology such as The Onion Routing (TOR), have facilitated the widespread use of these markets for the trading of illegal goods. At my company, our researchers continually monitor dark web and deep web threat actors and their ongoing activities. Based on our months of research and years of dark web monitoring experience, we have identified five main reasons dark web and cybercrime markets are booming. 1. Funds Flow Through Cryptocurrencies The anonymity of bitcoin has led the dark web market to flourish. This cryptocurrency enables sellers and buyers to execute a trusted transaction without knowing each other's identities. Each bitcoin transaction is kept private by only revealing their wallet IDs. Keeping a bitcoin user's transaction private allows them to enter criminal markets and get involved in buying illegal goods. A report released by a leading crypto-payment analytic firm, Chainalysis, showed a rise in bitcoin transactions on the dark web market: $250 million in 2012 to $872 million in 2018. They also projected those transactions to reach more than $1 billion in 2019. The criminal sellers operating in the dark web market have started to add attractive new offerings to their virtual stores. One of these is cybercriminals selling fiat money for bitcoin at 10% of its value, where the customer can pay a cybercriminal $800 in bitcoin and, in return, get $10,000 transferred to their bank account. 2. The Growth Of Anonymizing NetworksTOR's secured browser technology remains the largest anonymizing network, with more than 2 million active users connected directly to its service. The bandwidth capacity of this network has increased from approximately 50 gigabits per second in 2014 to over 300 gigabits per second in 2018. With this growth in the past five years, the number of unique addresses of TOR hidden services has increased from approximately 30,000 to 80,000. This overall growth in the TOR network has propelled the growth of dark web markets due to its expanding user base. 3. Ransom Payouts To Cybercriminals Ransomware attacks have been rapidly increasing over the past few years, and I believe one reason for this increase is the fact that cybercriminals are being paid out. For instance, in 2019, Riviera Beach City in Florida got their systems hacked by cybercriminals, and they end up paying out 65 bitcoins, which was equivalent to $600,000, to the attackers as ransom. In 2017, the Korean web hosting firm Internet Nayana ended up paying $1.14 million in ransom payments, which is considered to be the biggest ransomware payout to date. These payouts encourage cybercriminals, resulting in new ransomware attacks with more features. In my experience, some cyber insurance companies are also indirectly causing a surge in these ransomware attacks because they have started to pay the ransoms, which costs them less than remediation or backups. 4. Increasing Profitability Of Dark Web MarketsThe dark web's drug market has been booming in Australia, and it has proven to be highly lucrative for the dealers. Ransomware attacks are one of the most effective ways to earn a large sum of money from organizations. The proliferation of ransomware groups, such as Maze, is just one example of the growing marketplace. Some of these groups are actively recruiting hackers in the dark web market to expand their operations and target more organizations. Research conducted by the University of Surry's Michael McGuire notes that cybercrime yields $1.5 trillion in revenue per year among, which includes $860 million of drugs and weapons sales. Their earnings are increasing because the demand is reaching new heights. 5. Organizations' Attack Surfaces Are IncreasingAs organizations have rapidly moved to the digitization era, their network boundaries have vanished. Systems are more integrated than ever before. This movement has also increased the attack surface of organizations. With the increase in the earnings from such attacks, cybercriminals are vying for bigger and more opportunistic attacks.Organizations must consider investing their resources in the following to prepare themselves for the fight against cybercrime:• Gain visibility into the dark web and cybercrime markets to prepare for previously undetected threats. Answering fundamental questions such as, ""What are our crown jewels? Where are they stored? Who is accessing them, and how?"" is prudent to improving monitoring capabilities.• Take a risk-based approach in reducing your attack surface by proactively identifying and remediating vulnerabilities. Many organizations are still struggling due to the complexity of their internal policies, conflicting priorities, limited control over outsourced capabilities and poor governance.• Gain a situational awareness of cyberthreats and risks introduced by third parties, partners and suppliers. Cybercriminals are increasingly exploiting trust to conduct cyberattacks on their targets. While large organizations have deployed TPCRM capabilities, their confidence level is still quite low.With these tips, you're well on your way toward guarding against these new cyberthreats, but remember, these threats are constantly evolving. Be sure to keep your finger on the pulse of these trends to truly stay up to date with what you can do to guard yourself against them."

","The coronavirus pandemic and subsequent lockdowns to contain it have prompted the U.S. Treasury and the Federal Reserve to pump more than $6 trillion into the economy—with potentially much more to come. The unprecedented moves, which dwarf the federal government's response to the 2008 financial crisis, have sparked warnings the government risks ""undermining trust in currencies"" and that the dollar could become ""a big joke.""Governments around the world have bailed out businesses to the tune of trillions of dollars, sending ... [+] stimulus checks and paying wages to try to keep economies afloat amid crippling coronavirus-induced lockdowns. ""America has never seen anything like it,"" expert on the Federal Reserve and nonresident fellow at Brookings Institution, Peter Conti-Brown, wrote earlier this month, adding the extraordinary measures will put ""pressure on a traditional line between monetary and financial policy controlled by the central bank and the financial, economic, and fiscal policy controlled by the president of the United States and his representatives.""The extreme shock-and-awe response to the economic devastation wrought by the coronavirus pandemic has plunged the world into uncharted territory, with the financial and economic status quo badly shaken. ""Nobody really knows how this is going to turn out,"" financial writer and investment strategist at Mauldin Economics, Jared Dillian, wrote in a Bloomberg Opinion column last week. ""These numbers are so large that they no longer have any meaning; they are simply abstractions,"" Dillian wrote, pointing to warnings made by former Fed chairman Paul Volcker that ""it is a governmental responsibility to maintain the value of the currency they issue. And when they fail to do that, it is something that undermines an essential trust in government.""""After you throw a few trillion dollars around, people start to believe that it’s all a big joke,"" Dillian added. Calls for the Fed to offer support to ordinary Americans to a similar tune as big business have grown louder, with individual stimulus checks of around $1,200 quickly disappearing into the void. ""A People’s Fed could plausibly give every worker a monthly zero-interest loan, and then forgive them all,"" George Washington University assistant professor of economic history Trevor Jackson, wrote this month, adding the coronavirus ""pandemic has annihilated most of the boundaries of the possible.""Meanwhile, in response to the Fed and central banks around the world printing money while interest rates remain at historic lows, high profile investors are fleeing government bonds. ""If you're holding a bond that gives you no interest rate, or a negative interest rate, and they're producing a lot of currency and you're going to receive that, why would you hold that bond,"" asked Ray Dalio, the boss of the world's largest hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, speaking to financial newswire Bloomberg. Dalio said he expects the price of gold to rise in the current environment.Others have been making the case for scarce digital assets like bitcoin.""We have seen macro investors like Ray Dalio and others rallying around gold—and we believe it won’t be long before investors begin to accept the narrative around bitcoin,"" said Meltem Demirors, chief strategy officer at digital asset management firm CoinShares.""In a world where people are looking for real assets that hold value in an inflationary cycle, assets like gold and bitcoin become very appealing to hold.""The bitcoin price has failed to rally amid the global coronavirus-induced market crash but has held ...

While not all this information will be visible to every party, moving the complicated stock lending process to Axcore, or any number of competing blockchains, could save the industry billions of dollars in auditing costs by giving each party the assurance that when they do need to access the data, it will be the same for anyone. One OCC executive says as many as three employees are required to manage the reconciliation process for every profit-generating trader.The move, which is scheduled to be ready for clients in 2022, follows on the back of a previously unannounced proof of concept conducted by the OCC, one of the world’s largest equity derivatives clearing organizations, and shown to some of the largest financial institutions in the world, including Blackrock 
  
BLK
, Charles Schwab, JP Morgan and Bank of America 
  
BAC
.But the true potential power of such a transition lies not in any single project in its own right, according to Greg Schvey, co-founder of Axoni, but in the synergies that could arise from so many previously isolated platforms running on the same technology. In January 2020 a new equity-swap platform backed by Goldman Sachs 
  
GS
 and Citi was launched, also powered by Axcore, and the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC) is in the final stages of moving its massive $11 trillion trade information warehouse to the same platform.“What we're talking about here is another major piece of capital markets infrastructure, not just migrating over to blockchain generally, but running on the exact same platform as a number of other major asset classes and infrastructure providers,” says Schvey, who is also the CEO of venture-backed Axoni. “And as we project that forward, this is a huge step towards the end state of a globally connected web of perfect data synchronization.”Regulated by both the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) the OCC runs an options, and futures clearing platform developed by Nasdaq, an internally-built risk management system and a data platform, and the stock lending platform being moved to the Axcore blockchain. First developed in 1993 to help the OCC act as a guarantor when a lender and a borrower agree to a security deal, the platform helps the OCC reduce risk if the borrower faces any unforeseen obstacles in repayment.The project to upgrade that platform began in early 2019 with the proof-of-concept (POC) designed to show how using a shared, distributed ledger of transactions similar to bitcoin’s blockchain could reduce the need for auditors and accelerate settlement times. In the future, potential counterparties that viewed the POC, also including Morgan Stanley 
  
MS
, State Street, Citibank, Credit Suisse and Société Générale, could run their own node, helping them co-create and access the shared ledger of transactions. Only the OCC will run the validator nodes that control governance of the system, and allow new counterparties to be admitted. Similar to Hyperledger Fabric, originally created in large part by IBM 
  
IBM
 and R3’s Corda, created by a consortium of financial institutions, this system is called a permissioned network. Unlike public blockchains such as bitcoin and ethereum that anyone can access, these networks are by invitation-only.If successful, the project could reduce the need for the legions of auditors now employed to cross-check each counterparty’s records of a transaction, according to Matt Wolfe, OCC vice president of securities finance. “Our expectation is that by using a distributed ledger participants will be able to synchronize to that golden record in order to not have the prevalence of errors that they do have today, reduce the reconciliation costs and challenges and bring greater automation and efficiency to the process,” says Wolfe."

[+] presidency--if he wins a second term it could be remembered as a war Trump lost. Casual discussions around central bank digital currencies, sometimes called CBDCs, have been going on for the last few years. Digital currencies would work just like regular coins and notes issued by central banks but exist entirely online. Instead of printing or minting currency, the central banks would issue digital dollars via online accounts—similar to the commercial banking apps that have exploded in popularity in recent years.Employers could, theoretically, pay directly into these government-run accounts and both online and physical stores could accept payment from them. Foreign exchange could also be handled through them, easing the flow of international trade. The long-running debate among central bankers over the need for digital currencies was blown wide open last year by news of Facebook's libra project—something that almost saw the social media giant elevate itself to (or even above) central bank status as an issuer of the first global currency. World leaders and regulators slapped Facebook back down. ""We have only one real currency in the U.S.A., and it is stronger than ever, both dependable and reliable,"" Trump said last year in a Twitter tirade against Facebook's libra, as well as bitcoin and cryptocurrencies—scarce digital assets that were the inspiration for libra. ""[The dollar] is by far the most dominant currency anywhere in the world, and it will always stay that way.""Libra is expected to launch later this year, though somewhat reduced from Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg's original vision. Some U.S. lawmakers have proposed the creation of digital dollars and so-called FedAccounts as part of stimulus bills designed to offset the economic damage wrought by coronavirus-induced lockdowns. Facebook co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg defended Facebook's proposed cryptocurrency libra last ... [+] year. These have so far been excluded from final bills and may never get through a divided Congress—perhaps leaving Facebook's libra as a defacto digital dollar. ""The big battle for global financial supremacy could be between the digital yuan and Facebook's libra dollar, a digital version of the U.S. dollar,"" said financial author and trading veteran Glen Goodman, who made a name for himself by successfully navigating stock markets during the 2008 global financial crisis and has been closely following the development of central bank digital currencies. ""Both of these currencies may be launched as soon as this year and will make it quicker, cheaper and more efficient to buy, sell or transfer money from place to place. China will pull out all the stops to convince international trading partners to switch from the dollar to their new currency. If they manage to lure enough users, the U.S. dollar could be in deep trouble.""China is expected to begin internally testing a digital yuan with its four largest commercial banks this month and has lined up a raft of international corporate partners including coffee chain Starbucks 
 
SBUX
 and fast food giant McDonald's 
 
MCD
. Battle lines are now being drawn but the war could be measured in decades and not years. ""Given the risks inherent to such a transformation, China will phase in the CBDC very gradually,"" journalists at the widely-respected Economist newspaper wrote this week, pointing to analysis from Citic Securities that estimates it will take ""several years for the digital yuan to replace just about 10% of all physical cash in China.""Donald Trump's first term as U.S. president may have been marked by his trade war with China; but if he wins a second he could go down in history as the president that saw the U.S. dollar fall from grace."

Positions include: According to Indeed’s data, companies hiring for jobs related to blockchain include: When it comes to remote-only roles, the numbers are more dramatic. Since the beginning of January 2020, the share of all job postings that are for remote roles related to cryptocurrency increased by a whopping 40.3%. In March 2020 alone, the share of all job postings that are for for remote roles related to cryptocurrency increased by 42.86 %. The remote job positions include: As covered in March by Forbes.com, Kraken, the San Francisco-based cryptocurrency exchange, is also hiring. The company originally planned to hire 250 people in 2020, largely due to the upcoming bitcoin halving. As coronavirus led to people looking for alternative assets, Kraken bumped that number to 350, and moved up their hiring timeline.  According to data provided by the exchange, signups grew 39.5% in March month-over-month compared with February, while average daily signups for March were up 61% compared with January.“The traditional system seems to be completely breaking down all over the world,” said Jesse Powell, co-founder and CEO of Kraken. “So, increased customer demand is going to mean increased business for us, and it's going to mean increased hiring.” In recent weeks, the company turned to hiring people in the households of its employees, including roommates and close family members, for support related roles. “We did super streamlined on-boarding,” said Powell.Many of the jobs available in the blockchain industry are for developer positions.Part of Kraken’s motivation was to take care of its own employees. Part was to meet immediate demand. “We felt like members of the household were more likely to be able to vouch for each other,” said Powell. “In a remote working environment, having somebody there with you to help onboard you is really useful; someone sitting next to you to help to answer questions for you.”It’s not in Kraken’s interest to have its employees completely distracted with the coronavirus crisis, says Powell. “Whether that be a spouse or a roommate losing their job, and now they’ve got to figure out how they are going to buy food or how they are going to pay their rent,” he said. “We were able to alleviate that pressure, which we think makes people more productive.”They won’t have to deal with such distractions. “Just culturally and business wise, it made sense on so many levels to try to target the people in the households of our employees who are affected.”Originally, Kraken was expecting to do most of the hiring in the months after the Bitcoin halving, an pre-programmed event on the bitcoin blockchain in which the amount of bitcoin’s rewarded to miners for solving computing puzzles will be cut in half. It is scheduled for May. “We weren’t expecting coronavirus to drop in all of this uncertainty,” Powell said. “It was the reason to hire earlier than we normally do.” Kraken isn’t the only exchange hiring. San Francisco-based Coinbase announced in a blog post the opening of 100 positions across its United States offices, Europe, and Asia.“As a cryptocurrency company, we’re in a unique position,” the company wrote in a blog post. “Coinbase has never known a time where we’ve operated without volatility. We have managed through 40x growth in a year, and negative 10x growth.” Armstrong adds: “In a world where unprecedented stimulus packages are being rolled by governments around the world, and a major expansion of the money supply is likely, I believe there has never been a better time for people around the world to learn about sound money and a more global, fair, financial system powered by cryptocurrency. “If you’re looking to take a job in the blockchain industry, Powell points those interested towards the many Bitcoin job boards out there, such as BitGigs, the ‘Jobs4Bitoin’ subreddit, Crypto Jobs List, and others. Powell offers further advice, too. “If you don't have any experience in the industry, that is one thing to get yourself up to speed on,” he said. “Start reading as much as you can. We often will ask people questions in the interview process, just general crypto questions, to see if they have a basic understanding or are actually interested in the industry.” Kraken prefers to hire people who have an interest in crypto, not just someone looking for any random job. “If you're applying for a job, but it's a specific business, use their service, try it out, have an opinion about it,” he said. “It never hurts to come into an interview with a feature request or constructive critique.”By coming in with some understanding of the business, you can demonstrate to your prospective employer that you didn’t just blast out 1,000 applications indiscriminately. “I look at applying for jobs a lot like online dating,” said Powell. “If you think about how you are going to get the person to respond to your message in an inbox with 1,000 other messages, you've got to go a little bit further. Let them know that you really took some time to understand them and why this might be a good fit.” Many people indiscriminately apply for jobs hoping to get something, as if it's a numbers game, he said.“But, try and be more targeted to get that attention from the recruiter, the screener or whoever's reviewing the stack of 1,000 applications for one role.”"

The number of people making mobile merchant payments is expected rise from around 577 million last year to an estimated 700 million in 2022. China’s government move into digital payments would potentially be a competitor to AliPay, which is privately owned, though for now the government does not seem to have any plans to roll out a payments platform or a blockchain for those transactions. Worth noting, over the last 20 years, from the onset of China’s entrance into the World Trade Organization, the country went from a poor, cash-based society, to a highly innovative economy with a global, urban middle class in some key cities that are all plugged into the internet.Two key enabling factors in China made it ripe for a digital payments. The first is high levels of bank account ownership (79%), which served as a foundation for funding mobile wallets led by the two heavy hitters: Alipay and WeChat Pay.China has been able to build its digital payments ecosystem on the backbone of its existing financial infrastructure in the form of bank accounts and bank cards and clearing and settlement systems, says CGAP, a think thank that helps bring financial services to low-income countries. Both AliPay and WeChat Pay are considered “third-party payment companies,” which highlights their reliance on an underlying bank account. The second factor that sets up China for widespread digital currency use is smartphone ownership, including in rural areas."

This isn’t surprising as Sony has been a household name since the early ‘90s and their current position at the top is just Sony’s natural spot. The Japanese company is heavily invested in several new technologies including blockchain and AI, and the speed at which their testing and investments in the space are rolled out is remarkable.Last week it was announced that Sony have developed a high-speed processing technology that facilitates data transactions for a new breed of database platform called Blockchain Common Database (BCDB). The work was done as part of a transportation-focused Mobility as a Service (MaaS) initiative led by the Netherlands Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management back in 2019. What makes this technology interesting is that they have achieved successful execution and storage of seven million transactions per day, simulating a real-world scenario where buses, cars, bikes and taxis all share their location and other metrics.Sony's Blockchain Common Database (BCDB)Of course, Sony is no stranger to investing in the blockchain space. In 2018 they announced that they are working on a platform that will control and manage digital content and rights. They have also created a portal for managing educational course records and transcript management through blockchain, an initiative conducted by Sony Global Education along with Fujitsu. Fujitsu Sony Education BlockchainSince Japan has been one of the first countries to recognize the value of digital assets and begin creating a positive regulatory framework toward cryptocurrencies and specifically bitcoin as early as 2017 we have seen a lot of blockchain and digital assets investments coming from the Far East.

The decision to us Hedera Consensus Service (HCS) to provide a real-time, tamper-proof log for all coupon events on its platform, will allow coupon providers, manufacturers, clearinghouses, and retailers the ability to validate in real-time when coupons are registered and redeemed on the platform, without having to trust any single party.  The main work that the Coupon Bureau, whose advisory committee includes members from Target, General Mills, and GS1, does is to work with leading CPG manufacturers coupon issuing brands, as well as with accelerators that provide access to point-of-sale systems at leading retailers that represent almost 70 percent of the US retail market.  Meanwhile, Hedera Hashgraph is the enterprise-grade distributed public ledger. That aims to enable firms to build and run fast, fair, and secure applications on the distributed internet. A new area of focus for blockchainCouponing is a very important aspect of retail life, but it is something that has not moved very much with the times, and has only felt the negative effects of advancing technology, such as scams and fraud.Brandi Johnson, CEO of the Coupon Bureau, spoke to me about the need for DLT in the coupon space.“The challenges that the coupon ecosystem has faced over the last 10-years are related to lack of security and trust, as well as a not having an agreed upon centralized solution or real time validation of offers. The result is an insecure promotional tool (8110 barcode), and a whole host of siloed mobile coupon solutions that are not retailer agnostic. The way DLT and blockchain will be able to help is through providing a secure, agnostic audit log of all coupon redemption that is available to all connected stakeholders. In this new solution, Hedera will provide the backbone for the logs through the Hedera Consensus Service,” she explained. This is one area where retail is looking to step up and embrace new technologies, and we have seen this interest with the likes of Walmart and others embracing blockchain technology.Johnson added about the importance of the growing interest from Consumer Packaged Goods (CPGs) companies:“We hear about new developments using blockchain within the industry on a regular basis. While they all may not actually have deployed a solution yet, we get the sense that everyone is looking very closely at various solutions. In fact, one of the largest Consumer Packaged Goods (CPGs) companies was instrumental in moving forward with a blockchain solution in a major retailer. This project is in progress right now and we expect it to be deployed this year, which is when the general public will likely hear about it.” Deeper permeations for DLTThere has been a lot of progress in the space that involves cryptocurrency and especially Bitcoin in the financial space, however, the potential of blockchain technology is yet to find its place in the environment. It is unlikely that couponing will be the killer application of blockchain technology, but this is another notch to its mass adoption.The use of DLT in couponing of course makes sense for its ability to maintain transparency and negate fraud, but it is its links to some of the big retailers who can see the technology in action that is so important as they look to make things better for their customers. "

Open finance has fast tracked the digitization of financial services and beyond, essentially becoming the natural evolution of finance. Meanwhile, Bitcoin, the revolution of financial services, will continue to be the northern star for many. But the fast tracked evolution to that will be the connectivity of the world. Open finance promises just that, connecting the dots of data, payments and identity. When banking and marketplace infrastructures have been truly connected, as the internet originally intended (in effect the API-zation of financial services), we will have the necessary foundations for one robust, secure, transparent and fully functioning global blockchain. Since 2013 I’ve been directly and indirectly involved in several blockchain projects globally. By 2017 I had taken part in numerous proof of concepts across trade finance and payments. However, disillusioned with the lack of progress in the blockchain arena within financial services, I focused on opening up banks in a manner that was acceptable to the banks themselves, the regulators and most importantly, the bank customers. Open finance did just that, effectively paving the way for new technologies such as blockchain to move out of proof of concept and into production. While blockchain and distributed ledger technology certainly offer creative solutions for today’s marketplace, open finance has gone one step further, bringing regulators along for the ride. Blockchain is still perceived by many banks, governments and indeed regulators to be disruptive. The reason open finance is perceived as bank-friendly is simple. It is the solution, not the source to disruption. Banks can avoid disruption through an open financial services ecosystem built for collaboration and innovation. We call that open finance. To quote Charles Darwin, “In the long history of humankind, those who learned to collaborate and improvise most effectively have prevailed.” Businesses are built by humans, so naturally, the very same rules apply.While open finance requires a complete mindset shift across the banking community and beyond, it is clearly showing results. As a movement, it is gathering momentum and being mandated by regulators worldwide. That feeling of despair and disillusionment I once experienced in the world of blockchain is no longer there. In fact, the mindset shift to openness and the swift adoption of an API banking approach will no doubt result in a very hospitable environment for blockchain solutions going forward."

However, the legislation that includes the concept of a digital dollar is driven by monetary policy debates that have grown popular in light of COVID-19 and the attention Facebook’s Project Libra cast over cryptocurrency policy in Congress.

First, let’s examine the timeline of Facebook’s Libra which drove the bill in the Senate. U.S. Senate Banking Committee On Facebook, Libra, and a Digital Dollar May 7, 2019 - U.S. Senate Banking Committee held a hearing called ‘Privacy Rights And Data Collection In The Digital Economy.’ Facebook became a focal point in the hearing with respect to how much money is made off of individual’s data. May 10, 2019 - Senate Banking Committee sent Mark Zuckerberg a letter requesting more information on ‘Project Libra,’ described in an article in the Wall Street Journal. July 16, 2019 - Senate Banking Committee held a hearing on Facebook’s Project Libra with witness Mr. David Marcus, head of Calibra at Facebook. WASHINGTON, DC - JULY 16: Head of Facebook’s Calibra David Marcus waits for the beginning of a ... [+] hearing before Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee July 16, 2019 on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC. The committee held the hearing on ""Examining Facebook's Proposed Digital Currency and Data Privacy Considerations."" (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)July 30, 2019 - Senate Banking Committee held a hearing titled ‘Examining Regulatory Frameworks for Digital Currencies and Blockchain.’ Professor Mehrsa Baradaran of the University of California Irvine noted in her testimony, ‘The problems of inequality and inefficiency that bitcoin and the cryptocurrency industry has set out to solve are not problems of technology, they are problems of policy. And it is in this chamber, and not in a tech startup office or anonymous white paper, that these problems must be addressed.’ Banking For All Act On March 24, Senator Sherrod Brown (D-OH) , Ranking Member of Senate Banking Committee, introduced the ‘Banking For All Act’ that contains a digital dollar and digital dollar wallet. The press release described the benefit of a ‘digital dollar wallet, called a ‘FedAccount,’ a free bank account that can be used to receive money, make payments, and take out cash.’ FedAccounts can be used to make sure that everyone who is entitled to COVID-19-related relief receives it quickly and inexpensively. That means that people will not have to rely on costly check cashers or other alternative financial services.Professor Baradaran worked with Brown’s office to help develop this legislation. It is her belief that, while crypto has brought to light the issues of the unbanked, it is up to Congress and the Federal Reserve to address these policy issues. It is her hope the unbanked will be helped by a digital checking account offered by the Fed that includes partnering with the U.S. Postal Service. As Baradaran states in her testimony, ‘With a ‘digital’ checking account, they can begin to use mobile banking and other fintech services.’ Automatic BOOST To Communities Act Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) and Congresswoman Pramlia Jayapal (D-WA) introduced the ‘Automatic BOOST To Communities Act’ (ABC Act) on April 16. This act contains a digital dollar, a digital dollar wallet account at the Federal Reserve called a ‘FedAccount,’ and a digital dollar cash account at U.S. Treasury called a ‘e-wallet.’ The ABC Act was also innovative in supporting a new type of monetary policy theory known as Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) that has been popularized by the former Presidential Candidate Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) during his campaign and his embrace of the #MintTheCoin movement that originated from the ABC Act. Representative Tlaib credits Rohan Grey of the Digital Currency FIAT Institute with helping to design fiscal policy with Treasury by using a legal method to create two platinum coins by the U.S. Mint that are each worth $1 Trillion. These coins would be purchased by the Federal Reserve, and the resulting payments would be placed in a U.S. Treasury account that would fund monthly stimulus payments of $2,000 per person in the U.S. during the COVID-19 pandemic and then $1,000 per month person for 12 months following the pandemic.For a full explanation of how MMT is applied, the website below was established soon after the introduction of the ABC Act.Digital Dollar From A Crypto PerspectiveFor those in the blockchain space, COVID-19 certainly highlights how a digital dollar would be useful in the current environment, but may not be operationalized in time. ‘Realistically, the US will not implement a digital dollar in time to make a difference for the COVID-19 response. However, the current situation highlights why this country must move forward toward a modern digital currency capitalizing on blockchain technology,’ says Kevin Werbach, Professor of Legal Studies and Ethics at Wharton University and author of ‘Blockchain And The New Architecture Of Trust.’ Werbach served as counsel at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) during President Clinton’s presidency and was appointed by President Obama to co-lead a review of the FCC. Henri Arslanian, PwC’s Global Crypto Leader, agrees on the risk of rushing a digital dollar implementation. ‘Any implementation of a retail central bank digital currency (CBDC) is likely to be a very complex process with many implications. Rushing it, especially in light of the current situation, may not necessarily be the best option.’ Arslanian adds more as to why there is a strong demand overall for the introduction of a central bank digital currency. ‘In the past year, Facebook’s Libra and China’s digital yuan brought this topic on top of the agenda of many central banks. Ironically, COVID-19 is acting as another catalyst not only as a way of getting money quickly into the hands of citizens but also for public policy reasons, as many believe that banknotes may transmit the virus as bills get passed around from person to person,’ Arslanian stated. Marshall Hayner, CEO of cryptocurrency exchange MetalPay and co-author of the Crypto-Currency Act of 2020, which establishes a crypto regulatory framework at the federal level, noted, ‘Establishing a digital dollar is not only possible but an excellent choice for faster payment distribution, reducing fraud, eliminating counterfeit, and enabling a digital economy to prevent the current danger of physically handling cash. Not only do we have the mobile payments infrastructure for it with multiple mobile wallets such as Metal Pay, Venmo, Cash App, and Apple Cash, but there is a number of open source cryptocurrency wallets as well that support it that are global.’ Hayner notes in addition, ‘I think every American would be happy to hold cash on their smart phone as its simple and secure and can even be backed up and recovered if lost unlike your physical wallet!’ Whether physical or digital in nature, the debate over America’s money will likely go much further than the mechanics involved in producing a new digital dollar."

Supply Chains",https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeldelcastillo/2020/04/28/world-economic-forum-blockchain-tool-kit-could-fix-broken-food-supply-chain/,,"<div class=""content-data light-text""><span class=""hidden pageviews-wrapper""></span><time>Apr 28, 2020,</time><span class=""time""><time>06:00am EDT</time></span></div>",A supermarket with shelves devoid of food and household products during the COVID-19 pandemic. ,"While the internet has enabled a world where supermassive digital files can be sent globally in seconds, the world’s shipping orders have largely been trapped in 1950s accounting technology, relying more on paper bills of lading and phone calls to document the shipment of goods, than the benefits of online commerce. The modernization of this process has largely been hamstrung by two factors: competitors (and even partners) who don’t trust each other with valuable accounting records and therefore keep largely redundant files that need to be constantly audited; and then there’s certain legal responsibilities that come with accepting one of those paper bills of lading and the accompanying goods.In theory, the solution to both these problems could be blockchain, the accounting technology behind bitcoin that lets strangers do business with each other without sharing their personal information and that can prove a digital object is only in one place at a time. So, in September 2018, the World Economic Forum (WEF) started looking into the world’s aging supply-chain infrastructure and how blockchain could fix it. Back then, few people outside the blockchain world cared about food supply chains. While food-borne illnesses were estimated to cost the U.S. $90 billion in revenue annually, that was just a fraction of the $660 billion in revenue generated by the supermarket and grocery store industry.Then COVID-19 hit, and that aging infrastructure was made painfully evident. While restaurants, hotels, and tourist destinations that account for as much as half of food purchases were shut down to prevent the spread of the deadly disease, milk, bread, vegetables and a wide range of other perishable products vanished from grocery store shelves. Farmers unable to recalibrate their supply chain from wholesale to retail were forced to till their crops back into the soil, and milk was dumped down drains.Now, 18 months after the WEF started its research, its findings, released today as both a PDF and an interactive online service, could hardly be more relevant. Called ‘Redesigning Trust: A Blockchain Deployment Tool Kit,” the project is the result of interviews with 80 public and private companies and 20 governments to extract what project head Nadia Hewett, describes as “nascent insights and failures” of some of the largest projects ever launched in blockchain. If Hewett gets her way, the project will result in hundreds of completed proofs-of-concept finally being implemented to fix the world’s increasingly frail supply chains.“Those proofs-of-concept are now being taken up and dusted off again, says Hewett, who also leads the forum’s blockchain work.  “And I do think that this time what we’re seeing with this pandemic, there's going to be a lot more momentum to really make sure that things that should have been taken care of during other supply chain disruptions are really taken seriously this time.”The tool kit details a step-by-step process for how to assemble an ecosystem of participants that will all benefit from moving some process to a shared, distributed ledger, and how to solve both technical and non-technical problems. Included in the 80 corporate participants, is state-owned Saudi Aramco, which made news last year after going public with a $2 trillion valuation, and Deloitte, the same Big Four accounting firm that previously published a report finding that 92% of all blockchain projects were dormant or dead. While the tool kit is designed to help executives and developers using any supply chain, its targeting of the oil and especially the food industry is particularly pertinent. After consulting with representatives of past Blockchain 50 list members Bumble Bee Foods, Maersk, the United Nations World Food Program and others, the tool kit describes what it calls a minimum viable ecosystem (MVE) to launch a food supply chain connected via a blockchain. Specifically, the tool kit describes the MVE as at least a single retailer, a wholesale processing plant, a bank, a distribution center, a retail processing plant and a regulator. In addition to providing real-time information about where supplies might be bottlenecking, or to anticipate shortages before they occur, the report cites increased certainty for every member of a supply chain that the food was always at the legally required temperature, even when it was out of any single member’s control.  This graphic from the Redesigning Trust tool kit hints at the possibility of giving regulators ... [+] access to a special node that gives it access to certain transaction data.While the total impact of COVID-19 on the world’s food supply chains has yet to be calculated, anecdotal evidence is already rolling in. WEF tool kit contributor, the Port of Los Angeles, experienced a 23% drop in total business in February alone, and multiple reports of meat-packing plant closures augur a future meat shortage, perhaps only weeks away. And yet, in spite of numerous blockchain food supply chains already up and running for everything from olive oil to grain, Hewett says it’s very unlikely that any of the current systems alone will have a significant impact on COVID-19-related supply issues. “While there are blockchain solutions out there right now that governments and organizations are using for different ways in short-term COVID mitigation, the tool kit is more about the long term because a well-thought-out and responsible deployment takes time,” she says.Among five pilot partners who tested the tool kit before it rolled out today is Saudi Aramco, the most valuable publicly traded company ever. In the tool kit itself, Saudi Aramco chief digital officer Nabil Alnuaim said its recommendations were “drawn from an unparalleled community of business and technology experts.” But not all of those contributors came from such giant companies. In fact, with three other pilot partners from much smaller private institutions in the United Arab Emirates and one from Canada, Hewett says she hopes the lessons learned from the larger companies involved will help others with smaller budgets better capitalize the technology. “We need to make sure that we level the playing field for small- and medium-size enterprises in emerging markets,” she says. “There’s many today that do not have access to best-in-class information, experts that do not have the budgets to hire consultants. And this tool kit is a combination of best practices.” "

A few trends are emerging, and if considered, could give your business an edge up. ","4 Business Trends Emerging From COVID-19 | Stephanie Burns  1. Mobile Commerce And No-Touch Alternate Payment Options One area that is continuing to see innovation is how we pay for goods and services. This is especially true of online businesses, where many solopreneurs focus their efforts. Alternate payment methods like Apple Pay, PayPal and even bitcoin have all become increasingly prevalent, and you can leverage these options to gain more customers.In fact, ACI Worldwide estimated that 55% of e-commerce purchases would be made with alternative “non-card” payments in 2019. You can only expect these numbers to increase in 2020 as more people become comfortable with the new options available on their smartphones. Give your customers more ways to “no-touch” pay, and you’ll be more likely to earn their business.2. Leveraging Software  A lot of entrepreneurs are solopreneurs leaving them to be head chef and dishwasher. With the world running remote these days, adoption of backend technology has been paramount for entrepreneurs as they are turning to software to do the heavy lifting. Many SMBs use lead management tools like Clever Hub, Dubsado, and vCita, which offer scheduling software, contact management, billing and other conversion tools. Business coach, Joelle Nwoke, explained on the vCita blog, “Before I had no control of my time. Even if I had to get off the phone, clients would keep talking. So now I set up my schedule so that I don’t take any calls until after two. I’m also able to invoice clients through the system.”Brick and mortar businesses who have put off taking their offerings online, now have been forced to do so if they want to keep the doors open. Using an all-in-one technology to keep organized is a major focus.3. Expanded Opportunities Using Automation According to data compiled by invesp, “85 percent of all customer interactions will be handled without a human agent by 2020.” Chatbots are estimated to be able to typically answer approximately four out of five “routine questions” that a business might receive. When people have a question, they find it easier to simply type a short message into a chat box rather than send an email or pick up the phone and call.Other easily-integrated automation tools like Kajabi, help entrepreneurs selling information products to convert leads, bill and deliver to clients without always needing to be at their computers. Information products have seen a surge through this pandemic and solutions like Kajabi allow entrepreneurs to quickly jump into the market.Implementing such tools can be a major time-saver. You can automate customer questions, as well as selling and delivering your products. 4. Demand For Faster Delivery If you run an e-commerce brand that sells physical products, few issues are more important than shipping and logistics. For e-commerce brands, the issue may not necessarily be the ability to provide free shipping. Many consumers just want to get their order fast. From large retailers like Amazon, to boutique online stores like Frankie & Claude, e-commerce stores are offering many different shipping options to accommodate customers.According to Retail Touch Points, 88% of online shoppers are “wiling to pay for same-day (or faster) delivery services.” Of course, charging too much for same-day delivery could also backfire. A study from McKinsey found that most customers feel that same day shipping shouldn’t cost more than 8% of the total price of their purchase.Even with free shipping, however, expectations have changed. Survey data from RetailWire reveals that the average “maximum number of days people are willing to wait for an item to be delivered in exchange for free shipping has decreased from 5.5 days in 2012 to 4.1 in 2018.”Be mindful of how you plan to ship products to your customers. Faster delivery could help you land even more sales in 2020.Take these emerging trends into consideration as you move forward into the uncertain business landscape we are now facing. We’ll get through this!"

Firstly, it is good to look at the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet because this represents the driving force of why the whole world markets are not collapsed:The Federal Reserve balance sheetIt is an awesome response and just part of the picture of the money creation going on all over the world. This is a huge gambit, one certainly stuffed with unintended consequences. So here we are locked in our attics making a diary of events, what can we do as the world economy is swept by such titanic events?Firstly let’s pick three outcomes:1) Deflationary recessionThe economies of the world are dislocated, and demand will collapse and an overinvested infrastructure will have no pricing power and prices and industry will go into a vicious cycle of contraction. Prices will fall and industries will shrink. Nothing will make people spend and any money they have they will stash. A milder version of this is the stock explanation of why countries like Japan can’t grow and have inflation. You can’t push demand with money, it just gets locked up at zero interest. As such the globe will fall into a deeper and deeper spiral of deflation and cash will be king.2) Back to normalMiserable investors have a habit of making mountains out of molehills. Everyone will sprint out of lockup and spend, spend, spend. The system will be loaded up with a few more years of debt than it was going to build up anyway, so no big deal on the deficits. The world will muddle through. There will be pain and gain, but after a year of creaky recovery no one will be much the worse off for a few weeks of holiday in 2020. That sounds good, if you can keep that smile on your face while you say it.3) High hyperinflationI like this Wikipedia quote about hyperinflation, because for one thing, I didn’t write it, but also I can tick all its points neatly off as likely: “A sharp decrease in real tax revenue coupled with a strong need to maintain government spending, together with an inability or unwillingness to borrow, can lead a country into hyperinflation.” Inflation is a great reset for economies and has been used time and again by governments to get back to a reset after things like war. Printing money and handing it out is an easy fix for inconvenient short-term issues. Inflation swaps acute problems for chronic ones, so is the friend of politicians everywhere. Inflation is seldom an accident, no matter what is said. So let’s not pick a future, lets embrace all of them. So here is a strategy. Hold these three assets and shift the weighting depending on developments: Cash, stocks and bitcoin/gold.If you have no idea what happens next, simply go 33/33/33 (you can send me the spare cash and shift accordingly with the times or whim.Cash: This protects you from deflation. It has lots of other benefits but here the core one is, if the economy goes into a deflationary spiral, cash will go up in value. Cash will do fine in normal times and if inflation starts you shift your weighting towards stocks and gold/bitcoin and away from cash. It also gives you the possibility of buying assets at fire sales prices should opportunity knock.Stocks: If you buy good stocks, they should keep much of their value in inflation and deflation. They won’t do extremely well but they should shield you from the worst. They will do great if times return to normal. So as long as you don’t go long on stocks until after you think the worst is over, it will be a good place to put your money in the aftermath as you will capture some upside from the recovery and not lose too much from the downside of either deflation or inflation so long as you pick solid stocks. This is where your money will all end up when the new normal is established after economic extremes have passed.Bitcoin/Gold: Both these assets will go to the moon if inflation hits and may prosper on their own in any event. If the economy you are denominated in goes into deflation then you can bring down your weighting of bitcoin/gold into stocks and cash. I favor bitcoin ahead of gold as it is closer to cash in terms of conversion time frames and costs than physical gold. However nothing really beats cuddling gold for comfort in dangerous times and rich old-timers will find it hard to get to grips with newfangled crypto technology.What about bonds? you might say. I don’t do bonds so I can’t recommend. I suppose I read too many history books when the governments of the past ran off with bondholder’s money. I really don’t want to get bailed in, if instead of an economic miracle, we get the opposite. Have bonds issued in troubled times ever worked out well?All three legs of this hedge have minimal counterparty risk, if you want to keep that to a minimum, which anyone who can see bad times coming is sure to want. The positions are all liquid and apart from perhaps physical platinum group metals (PGM) easy to switch in and out of.I am 95% in cash but as the months pass I will be moving into position on this basis. I’d love to be 5% cash, 95% stocks, 5% crypto but I fear those days could be far away.——-Clem Chambers is the CEO of private investors website ADVFN.com and author of 101 Ways to Pick Stock Market Winners and Trading Cryptocurrencies: A Beginner’s Guide.

It had also hoped to reach the unbanked and potentially change the way the world used money, through digital currencies. However, this raised the hackles of more than a few regulators across the world, including the US’s as the Senate hauled Libra across the coals on concerns about a private entity creating its own money, and the privacy concerns that have long dogged the social media platform. Now, the new additions to the white paper, or should that be the removal of key tennents, will see the Libra project much more inline with regulators, but perhaps not as effective. However, this change intact is not being viewed so much as a pivot but rather progression by one of the Libra Association members — Bison Trails. Joe Lallouz, CEO of Bison Trails, spoke with me about the new direction, or progression, Libra is taking. It soon became clear in the summer last year that Libra would not easily launch with the regulatory concerns that were hounding it from all over the world. There were very few, if any, regulators, ready to wholeheartedly support the global coin. Now, the changes see, instead of creating a single new currency, Libra will launch a series of different digital coins, each backed by a different government currency one for one. In order to effect cross-border payments, there will also be a digital composite Libra coin for some of the currencies to send to countries with no digital Libra equivalent. Additionally, Libra is leaving behind its ambitions to move to a permissionless system, whereby anybody could help run the network, and no single authority would have control, as is common in the more well known decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.For Lallouz, this is conducive of progression rather than pivoting as the Libra Association Members prioritize working within regulatory boundaries.The updates to the white paper are representative of the Libra Association’s work to engage and work closely with regulators to help understand and address their questions and move the project forward. This is not a pivot as much as it is a progression of the project,” the CEO of Bison Trails told me. “The plan was always to engage with regulators. This was the plan from the beginning of the project,” he added. While it may appear that Libra is not going to be as ambitious of a project as first laid out, the changes being made will push it closer to being launched — which will have a greater impact than if it never had the chance to go live. “The most important thing to achieve a goal of mass adoption is to get the project out the door and into the hands of people that need it most. With the recently announced news, we’ve moved closer to that goal,” explained the CEO. “Bison Trails’ role remains constant. We’re primarily focused on the technology and helping build, manage, deploy and secure the blockchain network at scale. "

Among the excitement and debate, however, questions and open items remain among a number of different economic segments. While accountants and CPA’s might not be the first set of professionals that are thought of when the topics of blockchain and cryptoassets are mentioned, they have an important role to play. Taxation, financial reporting and disclosure, and helping to instill confidence, via audits, in valuations of cryptoassets, are at least partially dependent on accountants being able to handle the workload associated with blockchain. Simultaneously there has been debate about what blockchain, and what blockchain as it connects to other emerging technologies, means for the future of accounting. Will auditors be made irrelevant? Can CPA’s and accountants keep up? What does this mean for financial reporting, and other areas like environmental, social, and governance (ESG) reporting?From both sides of the conversation, the side of CPA firms as well as the business people they advise, understanding just what CPA’s and accounting professionals should know is critically important. Level-setting expectations is always a good thing, so what do CPA’s actually need to know about blockchain? In other words, if a firm is representing itself as offering blockchain advisory services to you, what might that look like? First, CPA’s are not going to have to become computer programming experts overnight. Blockchain can be used for accounting, and in conjunction with accounting tools, but is not necessarily an accounting system. Ask any CPA, and it is unlikely there is much of an appetite to enroll in coding and programming courses. Now, that does not mean practitioners and firms can claim total ignorance; training and education around how blockchain functions is going to be a “must -have” for the foreseeable future. Specifically, sector specific education and training is necessary in order to provide useful advice to clients; riches are in the niches after all. In order to even ask intelligent questions, practitioners need to understand what blockchain is and how it functions. Second, CPA's must be able to understand and explain how blockchain (permissionless, permissioned, or some other variant), interoperate with existing technology systems. Blockchains are impressive tools to be sure, but in order to report effectively and efficiently, the information must be able to be exported and analyzed with other existing technology tools. Many of the hacks and breaches that have caused millions in losses to retail and institutional investors alike have been linked to portals and access points rather than underlying blockchains. CPA’s must be able to assess and advise clients on potential weaknesses in the technology and control systems that connect with underlying blockchains. Most importantly, CPA’s must be able to objectively analyze whether or not blockchain is even a good fit for a client’s business and employees. Like any new technology there were early adopters, but the bulk of clients and customers were not in that category. For some reporting and data management issues the tools that already exist are perfectly serviceable, and in some cases are cheaper, faster, and better than blockchain equivalents. This may very well change over time, but a key role that CPA’s are going to need to fill is that of advisor. Such a role might take the form of technology expert or cybersecurity consultant, but in any case it should be connected to the objectives of the business. CPA’s don’t need to know everything about blockchain, but they need to be able to understand the technology itself, be able to discuss this technology with clients, and help clients make better choices related to this technology. Before hiring a CPA or firm to provide those services, make sure they can do so effectively."

A new strain of mobile ransomware targeting Android devices prefers good old credit cards.","Image:Checkpoint researchers were recently tipped off about the re-emergence of the Black Rose Lucy malware that they themselves first discovered back in 2018. It was already a dastardly piece of malware, enslaving Android devices into a botnet and delivering additional malicious payloads to the phones and tablets it infected. Now “Lucy” is full-blown ransomware.Once it’s taken hold on a device, files are encrypted and victims are given a ransom demand. To encourage them to pay, Lucy relies on a well-worn tool from the ransomware extortionist’s toolkit.Victims are told that the reason their files have been encrypted is because they’ve been caught perusing illegal pornographic websites. They’re told that they have committed a criminal offense and that a photo has been taken and submitted to the FBI.Then Lucy tells them they’ve been slapped with a $500 “fine.” Victims have three days to pay it at which point the amount triples. Alternatively, they can choose to fight the charges in court.That’s all bluster, of course. There are no criminal charges and no court date. While malware certainly has the capability of snapping a photo, it most assuredly was not uploaded to the FBI.If anything, it would be used by the attackers later to double down on the extortion. All in all, Lucy is a very different threat than it was two years ago. It’s also highly unlikely that the attackers only want credit card numbers to facilitate easy payments. There’s a good chance they’d wind up on carding forums for fraud purposes.Checkpoint says “represents an important milestone in the evolution of mobile malware” adding that it’s only a matter of time before we see a major mobile malware event.For now, though, there are steps you can take to protect yourself. Like many Android threats Black Rose Lucy can’t infect a device without a good deal of help from the user.Be wary of permissions that are being requested the first time you launch an app. If an app starts leading you down unfamiliar paths like enabling untrusted sources or accessibility features, stop what you’re doing immediately. Uninstall it and go back and look through its user reviews. Look for comments that repeat and low-effort posts like ‘good’ or ‘legit.’ And while you’re in the Play Store, it wouldn’t hurt to grab a good antivirus app.There are plenty available, like Sophos Intercept X Mobile and Malwarebytes."

As a 19-year-old medical student, I had developed an interest in blockchain mining, and I wanted to have an income that could support me during my studies. The products of this company ended up completely changing my life and altering the direction of my future, and the experience allowed me to discover my true passion for entrepreneurship.On a tram ride during my final year of sixth form, a friend of mine told me about something strange called Bitcoin. At the time, I was too focused on getting into medical school that I didn’t give it a second thought. It was only in the summer before I started at university that I decided to look into Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. Upon learning about this technology, I was fascinated by it and quickly saw its potential.During my first year of university, I spent some time brokering small over-the-counter cryptocurrency deals. While conducting these deals, I noticed that there was a huge gap in the market for reliable blockchain mining companies. In August of 2016, I decided to take the plunge into the world of business and founded my first company. As a young man, I had no clue what I was getting myself into. Running your own company is very difficult. I’ve been fortunate to have a wealth of business exposure at such a young age, but I had to learn many things the hard way.Now, I am focused on creating and growing businesses, and I would like to share some of the lessons I learned from this early experience.Leverage free resources.One of the greatest features of the internet is that it has a wealth of information completely free of charge. This information is a vital tool for any entrepreneur who is looking to start a business. I spent six months setting up the foundations of my company. Among other things, this involved making a website, finding reliable companies to work with and learning about the most important aspects of the blockchain mining industry.LinkedIn is just one example of a free online resource that can provide a great way to connect with figures in your industry. You would be surprised at how keen a lot of people are to help, if you’re just willing to ask.Create a system to source clients.Offering a service or selling a product is not possible without having a system that can source clients. I experimented with multiple advertising platforms, including Facebook, Reddit and Instagram. Unfortunately, they never yielded the results I was looking for, and I figured this was due to not reaching the correct audience.When I stumbled upon Google Ads, it was a pivotal turning point for New Mine. The great thing about Google Ads is that when someone is searching for a service, your product can appear at the top of the search engine. In February of 2017, I closed my first sale to a client in Texas, without ever meeting the client face to face. This first order was the spark that provided me with the capital to run more ads and generate more client leads.When you’re looking to create a system to source clients, allocate a small budget to experiment with multiple platforms. You also need to consider your target audience. If you’re trying to target millennials, for example, Instagram can be a great platform to utilize.Don’t be afraid to go it alone.During the company’s first year, I was a one-man army. I did everything. At times, it was stressful, but I enjoyed the challenge of it. When I was sitting my end-of-second-year exams, I remember that all I could think about was how I was going to fulfill the pending orders the company had.Even if you’re going it alone, that doesn’t mean you can’t have support along the way. Try to find an experienced mentor, and pick up a few good books on entrepreneurship. Investing in educating yourself is the greatest investment you can ever make.Most importantly, don’t neglect your personal life. You won’t perform at your maximum if you’re not giving yourself time to switch off.Provide personalized client service.I regularly get asked why buyers chose my company. At the time I founded New Mine, there weren’t many companies in the blockchain mining space, so this meant buyers had limited options. In addition to this, I took the utmost care of our clients. I gave them my personal number so they could reach me 24/7. This quality of service helped me generate more leads through word of mouth.To provide exceptional service, I advise that you don’t bill your clients for everything. No one wants to feel like they’re being rinsed by a company. I regularly offer free trial runs to clients to make sure that New Mine is a good fit for their needs.Of course, this is just an overview of my entrepreneurial journey. In my fourth year of medical school, I decided to leave so that I could be a full-time entrepreneur. Launching this company has been the greatest yet most challenging experience I’ve ever tackled. Despite the challenges, it has been incredibly rewarding. As an entrepreneur, I view that my upside in life is not capped. The opportunities are limitless, if you’re willing to take the risk and go out there and chase them."

Same?",https://www.forbes.com/sites/richardgendalbrown/2020/05/06/the-internet-is-a-public-permissioned-network-should-blockchains-be-the-same/,,"<div class=""content-data light-text""><span class=""hidden pageviews-wrapper""></span><time>May 6, 2020,</time><span class=""time""><time>08:59am EDT</time></span></div>","Imagine you typed www.google.com into the browser on your Mac and it took you to Microsoft Bing. You’d probably be a bit confused, and maybe angry. But this doesn’t ever happen. Why is that? ","The answer is because, at the heart of the design of the public Internet, is a hidden system of governance and ‘permissioning’ that makes it all work. The Internet is a public network with permissioning of some key resources. And the lessons we can learn from this have profound implications for the future of blockchain systems, especially in the enterprise.Here’s a summary of the argument I make in this piece:Public/Private and Permissioned/Permissionless are independent axesLet’s work through the example above a little. Why don’t you ever see Bing when you type www.google.com? There are two main reasons you don’t get Bing when you want Google: the Internet’s Domain Name System (DNS) and because of Digital Certificates. To understand why, imagine I am a bad guy trying to send all of Google’s traffic to Microsoft. How would I do it?First, I’d need to set up a Domain Name server that gave the wrong answer whenever it was asked for Google’s address. So when somebody typed google.com into their browser, I could control where their browser went.But if I just sent them to bing.com, that wouldn’t be enough. The padlock wouldn’t show on the browser. You would spot the error. (You do check for the padlock, right?) To make it work, I’d have to solve the padlock problem. The technical details aren’t too important but the key thing I’d need to do is issue myself a “certificate” for google.com. And that would make the padlock show on your browser. And the reality is that anybody with a bit of technical knowledge and a few spare hours spare could do this pretty quickly.Easy!Well, not quite... It actually wouldn’t work. (Sorry, wannabe hackers…) But the reason why it would fail is of fundamental importance to the future of enterprise blockchains. And that is because it shows the critical importance of the concept of permissioning.Why wouldn’t it work, exactly? The answer is that the Internet is a permissioned system. Potential providers of critical Internet infrastructure like DNS and Certificates need permission to have their services utilised and trusted. We don’t often think about it this way but that’s what’s going on.  The reason the trick above fails is because I can’t force you to trust my DNS server and I can’t force you to trust my ‘certificate’. In the former case I would need you or your ISP to choose to trust my DNS server. In the latter case, I would need Apple to include my Certificate Authority (CA) on the list of CAs that Macs and iPhones trust out of the box. Providers of critical services have to be invited in. They don’t get to just “rock up” and join the party without permission.Sure... you can bring a bottle and knock on the door. But if your name’s not on the list, you’re not coming in.If you haven’t permitted your computer to rely on my DNS server, it doesn’t matter how many lies I publish. And if I haven’t gained permission from Apple to include my Certificate Authority in its list of approved Certificate Issuers for Macs and iPhones then nobody using an Apple product will pay the slightest bit of attention to the certificates I issue.  The same applies for Google with Android, and Microsoft with Windows. In short, the Internet works because some of the fundamental building blocks of its operation – directory services, addressing, identity management – are under the control of organisations such as IANA, browser vendors and others, or are matters for individual users, who almost invariably delegate them straight back to their ISP or operating system vendor in any case. An aspiring provider of critical Internet infrastructure needs to obtain explicit permission from one or more of these groups if their service is going to be adopted or trusted. You don’t get to just fire up your service and impose your will on others.So the Internet is a fascinating beast. It is a truly public network: open, shared, general purpose, accessible to pretty much anybody willing to pay for a connection and who can find somebody who will sell them one. And it is also permissioned: providers of critical services such as DNS or Certificates don’t get to force others to consume their service or trust them. Control – permissioning – is in the hands of the users and trusted central parties.So now turn our attention to blockchains.  It should be beyond debate that, outside some special use-cases, often in finance, blockchain networks should be public. Large, open, connected, shared networks that can form organically and with minimal barriers to entry and with pricing that tracks cost. Bitcoin and Ethereum pass this test, of course. As does Corda Network, which is open to all legal entities on a cost recovery basis. And James Carlyle wrote earlier this year about how much Corda Network’s philosophy is aligned with the Alastria network vision.But many in the Ethereum community argue that businesses shouldn’t just use public networks, they should use permissionless ones. By which they usually mean the main Ethereum network.This sounds superficially appealing. Yet the lesson of the internet is that there can be some very tricky “gotchas” if you don’t also have some control over critical infrastructure services.  If the internet was truly permissionless, I would indeed have been able to trick your computer into going to Bing when you wanted to go to Google. Or something far worse.So the idea that businesses should bet on permissionless networks deserves scrutiny. In particular, if some of the most fundamental services requiring permissioning on the internet are routing and identity verification, are there any equivalent questions for blockchains? The answer, it turns out, is yes. There is one very important infrastructure service: transaction confirmation.When you submit your transaction to the network, you want it to be confirmed. But by whom? Who provides the confirmation services? What guarantee are you receiving?On networks like Ethereum and Bitcoin, the underlying philosophy is one of censorship resistance. The networks exist to make it impossible for anybody – not even an elected government – to prevent transactions being confirmed. And so on Bitcoin and Ethereum there is nobody, not even you, with the power to decide who confirms your transactions. Anybody with enough computing power can turn up and compete to “mine” a block containing your transaction. They have the power to confirm, but also the ability to reverse a confirmation if they amass enough computing power. A confirmed transaction can subsequently become unconfirmed.Be in no doubt: censorship resistance is an amazing historical advance for those who need it. But there is a wicked sting in the tail: transaction confirmation on Proof-of-Work networks is inherently probabilistic. Transactions are only ever probably confirmed. If censorship resistance is your goal then this is probably a good trade-off. But what if censorship-resistance is not your goal? What if you want to know who the parties providing confirmation services in the confirmation clusters are? What if you want to be sure that once a transaction is confirmed it stays confirmed? (Or who to sue if it doesn’t?)And this is where the Internet gives us the answer. This is exactly the same problem as the one I opened this article with. Just like the Internet, we want blockchain networks to be public – open, shared, general purpose - whenever possible. But there are some capabilities within those public networks where there needs to be some control over who can provide them. The specific capabilities may differ between the Internet and blockchains but the solution is the same: permissioning.Not permissioning of who can join the network. We all agree public networks are massively powerful where they can be used. But we do need permissioning of who can provide some critical common services. This is why I think the public blockchains taking a similar approach to the internet are the ones to watch. Corda Network, Alastria and Sovrin are all examples of public networks that work in this public, permissioned way. Just as no rogue Certificate Authority on the internet can force you to accept its fake certificates, no rogue consensus provider on Corda Network, say, can force you to accept its confirmation decisions; they have to have been permissioned into that role on the otherwise public network. You wouldn’t accept an internet connection that only probably connected you to the real Google – or to your real online banking portal. And you probably don’t want a blockchain network that only probably confirms your transactions.Yes, public is the future. Public, permissioned. Just like the Internet."

While there are, no doubt, multiple organized crime organizations involved in everything from phishing and fraud through to hacking and extortion, the day-to-day reality is a lot more mundane. New research, published today, reveals the real reason why there is so much cybercrime: finding, buying and deploying malware, ransomware and more has never been easier or cheaper. Darknet forums have become the online supermarkets of cybercrime, stacking the criminal tools high and selling them cheap. The bar for entry into the cybercriminal club has never been so low. In fact, anyone can join; advanced technical knowledge isn't needed, nor are deep pockets. These darknet cybercrime marketplaces even offer free updates and tech support. Oh, and you can find them with the simplest of Google searches.Researchers from CyberNews explored multiple cybercrime marketplaces in order to analyze the cost and availability of malware tools and the support networks behind them. What they found may well shock some readers: off-the-shelf malware is now easier to find, cheaper to buy, and so easy to use that almost anyone can become a cybercriminal as long as they have their Bitcoin wallet to hand. The troubling thing is that these marketplaces aren't tricky to find. Anyone with access to Google can track down hundreds of such markets in a matter of seconds. Link lists of hacking sites and ""security boards"" exist as categorized directories, indexed by country, that enable the would-be cybercriminal to go shopping in just a couple of clicks.Although the researchers found plenty of free malware tools being offered, these come with the most risk attached for the user. Anyone serious about becoming a professional cybercriminal is going to give the freebies a very wide berth. The worrying thing is that advanced tools, complete with free updates and technical support, can cost as little as $50 (£40) and be found on forums operating quite openly online. You don't need to be a programmer to use these tools; they really are off-the-shelf packages. However, the CyberNews researchers did find that the ""quality"" of offerings from the easiest to find, open to anyone, marketplaces was very inferior to that of products traded on invite-only forums. The latter, mostly operated by veteran Eastern European criminals, is where the highest-grade malware tools are sold to the most serious of criminal actors.""It’s safe to say that malware creators can come from many walks of life, but they usually hail from countries and regions where cybercrime legislation is not strictly enforced, while at the same time, talented and tech-inclined people don’t have many opportunities for gainful employment,"" a CyberNews spokesperson says. This means that there's a ""constant, abundant supply of people eager to enter this lucrative profession,"" the spokesperson concluded.The real cost of cybercrime is measured not in how much the perpetrators pay for their tools, but rather in the misery caused to victims, both large and small, corporate and personal. However, the financial cost of becoming a cybercrime player is depressingly minimal. The CyberNews research reveals that data-stealing Trojans that can grab passwords, credit card data, and even images from webcams can be bought for as little as $50 (£40) including tech support. Need a platform from where to launch your nefarious payloads? A basic, barebones, modular malware bot can be yours for $400 (£322.50), and remote access Trojans (RATs) that enable the complete takeover of a computer start at $800 (£645) with support. Although, when it comes to ransomware, most sellers provide this on a Cybercrime-as-a-Service (CaaS) basis for a rental fee. CyberNews researchers found it was possible to buy ransomware building packages designed for attacking large corporates for a monthly $800 (£645) fee. The most expensive items on the cybercrime shopping list were banking Trojans. The type that comes disguised as legitimate software, but which can access online bank account details were on sale for $5,000 (£4,025), including technical support.The return on investment when it comes to cybercrime tools is measured in successful ransom attacks, blackmail, fraud and the sale of intellectual property, according to Ian Thornton-Trump, CISO at Cyjax. ""When you see prices for both the malware and the data it's stolen go down if you apply the law of supply and demand, it means there is an oversupply of CaaS platforms and stolen data in the system,"" Thornton-Trump says. But there is an upside, according to Thornton-Trump. ""Honestly, I like cheap easy to buy malware because that malware should be able to be scooped up by counter cyber threat intelligence operators, reverse engineered, heuristically examined, indicators of compromise (IOC) and definitions created.""The CyberNews team told me that ""the increasing availability and decentralization of malware tools means that cybersecurity professionals will have to keep up, and proactive cyber intelligence might be an answer. The better we understand how malware is created, traded, and exploited by cybercriminals, the quicker the countermeasures can be deployed.""

""Sure, it's going to cost a bit,"" Thornton-Trump concludes, ""but those are real and easily deployable things IT and security can do to prevent cybercriminals from further success.”"

Red Flags",https://www.forbes.com/sites/colinharper/2020/05/06/people-are-tokenizing-themselves-on-ethereum-why-personal-tokens-raise-red-flags/,,"<div class=""content-data light-text""><span class=""hidden pageviews-wrapper""></span><time>May 6, 2020,</time><span class=""time""><time>06:01pm EDT</time></span></div>",Tokenization just went postmodern.,"So-called DeFi community members are tokenizing themselves on the Ethereum blockchain. These tokens, minted with the name of the individual who created them, are being pitched as stakes in the brands or “digital communities” of their tokenizers. When they’re not promising a dividend from the tokenizer’s salary, these tokens can be redeemed for services, like, well, talking to the tokenizer, accessing their content, or renting out their professional time.Instead of just charging cash for these services (or ETH or BTC)—or taking out a loan, for that matter, if they need the money quick—these intrepid tokenizers are launching “personal token” sales for what one of them calls “a utility-driven tool for [his] digital community.”The stunt is reminiscent of the worst behavior that fueled the 2017 ICO boom, David Hoffman, the COO of the RealT tokenized real estate platform, told me over a phone call. Except this “self-aggrandizing”  token sale model is even worse because people are buying a token that has even more dubious utility and assurances than the so-called utility tokens that flooded the Ethereum ecosystem in 2017.“These tokens are backed by the reputation of a single individual. It’s the exact opposite of what the whole cryptocurrency industry is about; in which trust is purposely removed. The value of these tokens is collateralized by trust in the individual.” Indeed, take developer and content creator Kerman Kohli’s KERMAN token, for example, which can be exchanged to access his Telegram group, subscriptions to his DeFi newsletter, his professional time or a retweet on his Twitter timeline. The utility basically revolves around being able to pay Kohli to talk to him (or, more bizarrely, to vote on his major life decisions, like purchasing a car). Alex Masmej’s own eponymous token also grants spenders access to his time and (non-binding) voting over his life decisions.For Kohli, at least, the other selling point (besides buying the privilege to speak with its creator) is creating artificial scarcity: Kohli said he will burn tokens used to purchase his time, and he also plans to buy back circulating tokens with 5% of the revenue from his newsletter.In his blog post, Kohl asserts his belief that his token “is not a security or investment contract and [is] purely the redemption of [his] time.”Masmej was bolder in his blog post. A stake in ALEX, Masmej pledges in the announcement, gets you “15% of all income I make for the next 3 years ... capped at $100,000, distributed quarterly, in DAI (or equivalent stablecoin).”He describes the personal token aptly as “a blend between a small Income Sharing Agreement and a human IPO.”Perhaps too aptly, Hoffman thinks. Masmej’s promises (explicitly) and Kohli’s claims (implicitly) smack of investment lingo. As he put it, “this is literally a textbook illegal securities offering,” one that offers its buyers “no regulatory safeguards, investor protections or recourse of any kind.”“When you use Bitcoin or Ethereum,” he continued, “you rely on the blockchain’s assurances; when you buy a security, you rely on the assurance of the U.S.’s regulatory system. But with personal tokens, the settlement assurances you have are based on trust so it’s the exact opposite of real cryptocurrencies—the whole entire system is based on trust in the tokenizer.”Even if these tokens may pose a securities risk, that hasn’t stopped one DeFi platform from hosting them. Roll, a DeFi platform that allows its users to launch “a digital community offering,” according to a Roll representative,  doesn’t believe that these tokens represent an investment contract or security of any kind; rather, they are a crowdfunding mechanism that allows token buyers to access content from the tokenizers in tiers like Patreon. In essence, Roll told me, it’s a platform for self-monetization.“The economics of the web are bending towards content creators,” they said over direct messages, adding that their platform’s mission is to give these creators a place to tokenize their time as “social money” and use this “user-generated currency” to build their communities.“User-generated currency is the next $100B+ opportunity and the future of the market will be integrated deeply with the social web, hence the name social money” they expounded. (Emphasis theirs).Both tokenizers have launched their self-proclaimed experiments on the DeFi startup, and Roll has purchased a stake in both tokens. The Roll representative told me that they’re “the top liquidity provider for $ALEX on Uniswap … and [are] doing the same for $KERMAN.”In his just-launched token sale, Kohli is selling 1,500,000 KERMAN with the hopes of raising $30,000 at $0.02 a token (this ICO supply exists among a larger 3.2 million circulating supply which exists among a much larger 10 million outstanding supply). Alex hit his target of $20,000 during his own token sale in early April, selling 1 million tokens to “30 shareholders” for $0.02 a pop (his circulating supply, roughly 4.2 million, also exist amidst an outstanding supply of 10 million).Kohli and Masmej did not immediately respond to requests for comment; this post will be updated to include their comments if they respond after publication. Self-tokenization is a relatively new concept. In one of its first iterations, Spankchain founder Ameen Soleimani launched a token that people can redeem for retweets from the prolific Ethereum developer (an obvious precursor to one of the proposed utilities of KERMAN). However, Hoffman highlighted that Soliemani’s token is different because it demonstrates clear utility, makes no other guarantees, and—most importantly—is not being solicited as an investment. Even Spencer Dinwiddie’s plan to tokenize his contract—likely a source of inspiration for others—is a different case. Not only is Dinwiddie planning on selling the tokens as a Regulation D securities offering to accredited investors, but it would actually pay dividends to its holders (and if it didn’t, securities law would step in).Returning to his core problem with the personal token model, Hoffman re-emphasized that the assurances and utility that come with Soleimani and Dinwiddie’s tokens don’t exist for KERMAN and ALEX holders.“How risky this investment is, is completely defined by Kerman. In his Disclaimer, he says “this is a highly risky investment, and that you could lose all your money”, which is a terrible thing to say, because with ‘personal tokens’ the issuer is in complete control over exactly how risky the investment actually is. It’s largely up to them as to whether there are risks or not.”"

Forrester Research posited in January 2019 that in the United States, B2B e-commerce “will reach $1.8 trillion and account for 17% of all B2B sales in the U.S. by 2023.”Services between businesses are growing. The main reason is the numerous opportunities: Digital businesses can provide wholesale products, retailer goods, services or distribution. There are some as simple as cleaning services for offices or as complex as software vendors. My company is a B2B e-commerce company, and we have gleaned the conclusions in this article from research and experience. Here are some of the reasons that many buyers prefer the digital B2B world, beyond the number of services.Access To A Larger Customer Base: More B2B Transactions Are Happening OnlineNet Solutions conducted a study in January 2020 about the state of B2B e-commerce. It found that B2B takes cues from the business-to-customer (B2C) market and tries to emulate the latter’s growth strategies by adapting them.Many B2B companies are moving online because their customer base is there, as well. The clients want knowledge about the products and services available to find the best items or software for their business purposes. Forrester Research found that 74% of B2B buyers conduct research online before purchasing. Education and valuable copy need to go hand-in-hand, and many B2B companies deliver on knowledge.On this note, smartphones, tablets and other mobile devices are often used to make purchases. Net Solutions reveals that 91% of B2B customers use mobile devices to search for a product, and 25% use them to make a transaction. Thus, B2B companies need to have storefronts and webpages that are mobile-friendly and convenient to access. They need to implement upgrades to certain platforms to make them easier for users to access and organize their orders. An office manager, for example, will want to calculate future budgets and check past purchases accordingly.Shipping for physical goods is another concern. B2B companies need to ensure that they can match Amazon for two-day shipping — or other benefits if they cannot meet that standard. This is where wholesalers can stand out by dropshipping, or delivering products only when a customer makes an order. Dropshipping not only reduces the pressures of shipping, but also the risk of accumulating unused inventory. Many e-commerce B2B services are working to fill this niche and increase efficiency within the marketplace.Flexible Payment OptionsTraditionally, businesses would have to pay for services and goods using cash, check or a credit card. While credit cards have benefits that allow owners and managers to build a business’s credit, they can also prove inflexible. Many B2B customers would rather avoid such inconveniences.Thanks to the internet, e-commerce has a larger variety of payment options. In addition to bank account transfers and credit cards, office managers can often pay via PayPal, Venmo, Apple Wallet or other digital currencies. PayPal even offers credit cards so that a business can take advantage of the policy. This lowers potential barriers for inexperienced or newer entrepreneurs to enter certain fields, as well.While each vendor has its drawbacks — for example, PayPal sometimes will freeze accounts for seemingly arbitrary reasons and take months to restore access to users — they also offer alternatives with convenience. For example, people can install Venmo on their phone and pay off vendors quickly. This flexibility means that a manager doesn’t have to rely on one source of payment for these transactions.Cryptocurrencies are another tentative and still uncertain currency. Cryptocurrency uses blockchain technology to decentralize payments. A business that can handle the changing markets could potentially invest in Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies to gain a return on their investment. While this is one viable option, others can use cryptocurrencies to handle regular transactions for products and services.Many B2B Buyers Are Younger And Want A Personalized ExperienceGen X and Gen Y are some of the top users of B2B e-commerce. Gen X is the generation that came of age in the 1980s and early '90s, followed by Gen Y, also knowns as millennials, with birth years between 1981 and 1996. Together, they are key players and business decision-makers.B2B researchers, or potential customers who seek information on certain products and services to assess their value, can provide living proof that millennials are powerful within this type of business. In 2015, Google conducted a study and found that 46% of B2B researchers were between the ages of 18 and 34.Many millennials want an enhanced customer experience when making a purchase online. They will seek as much knowledge as possible about the products that they desire for an office or digital workspace. That means an ideal storefront will be easy to navigate on any digital device, with options for a fast transaction and efficient record-keeping. A track record for purchases allows them to make informed decisions, which increases their confidence in the company providing the history.One potential solution is to either design or to outsource the creation of an app for your business. Many corporations have these apps, such as Whole Foods, with QR codes to allow for efficient checkout at grocery stores. While we don’t advise most e-commerce businesses to compete with a corporate giant, you can learn from them.First, you can provide convenience to the customer experience. These apps would be used for transactions within or related to your business. If they can purchase easily, then they will be more likely to buy.Second, they can create customer loyalty programs; you can reward these consumers for multiple purchases and track general trends. The more information you have, the more growth opportunities are available.As we enter the 2020s, grow within global B2B. With technology expanding, you have ample chances to gain a higher market share. Trust your B2B marketers and their research reports to help you reach a higher level."

Identity Layer",https://www.forbes.com/sites/colinharper/2020/05/05/a-new-project-hosted-by-the-linux-foundation-wants-to-fix-the-webs-missing-identity-layer/,,"<div class=""content-data light-text""><span class=""hidden pageviews-wrapper""></span><time>May 5, 2020,</time><span class=""time""><time>07:41am EDT</time></span></div>","The Linux Foundation is hosting a new open source project, one that’s gunning to improve how we use digital credentials to prove online identity. ","The Trust Over IP Project (TOIP, for short) is the latest initiative to win the favor of The Linux Foundation, the non-profit organization committed to free and open source software development. By hosting ToIP, the Linux Foundation will feature the project on its website, but ToIP will have to provide its own funding.ToIP’s mission is simple, even if the problem it’s solving isn’t: it wants to create a standardized framework that will alter and optimize how we verify identity online. At scale, such a system, complete with a tech stack and guidelines for best practice, would theoretically improve security and privacy for everything on the web that requires you to verify your identity—from booking travel to logging on to social media and everything in between. Given the project’s scope, it’s little wonder it has attracted interest from all walks in both the public and private sectors. Its membership includes Mastercard 
  
MA
, the University of Arkansas, IBM Security, the government of British Columbia and 25 other entities. The core issue ToIP wants to solve is the problem establishing trust between two entities online. For example, when you log on to Facebook (if you still do, that is), you can’t currently prove to Facebook that you are you simply by visiting the site from your IP address. Instead, Facebook has to store credentials for you in the form of a username and password; this establishes your identity and credentials for this site.The problem is, it also introduces a level of trust: you’re entrusting Facebook (and companies like it) with your data. And so with this model, online identity and its contingent data is gate kept by a handful of mega-corps. What if, instead, this process were standardized to be more private and more secure, or even disintermediated so that users hold the keys to their own data? Blockchains have been pitched as the technological breakthrough that will make this possible. If public chains like Bitcoin and Ethereum are used, the argument goes, they cannot be easily altered and are not typically controlled by a single entity. With this base layer you can create an immutable reference for a digital identity (DID); anyone who has a DID could prove ownership by referencing the record on the blockchain, and data that keeps track of which DID corresponds to which reference is stored either locally on each users device or in a third party database.But it can only improve the situation so much. You can never remove all trust and human error entirely. This is why ToIP is also focusing on developing standards and a best practice framework, because they believe that technology is only one half of the solution; the other is in governance.“When identity met blockchain 2 or 3 years ago, everyone thought this problem was solved, but blockchain is one end of the spectrum,” Drummond Reed, one of the founding members of the project, said over a Zoom call.His colleague and fellow founder John Jordan agreed, adding that at the other end of the spectrum lies “the human element.”“So many approaches to DID and trust infrastructure are all about tech. You can have the best tech in the world and fail because you don’t have the best practices to establish trust between the humans behind the technology.”So the final goal is not only to provide technical solutions but also “rules that can be adopted by the entire [data] industry … and general guidelines for establishing digital trust and templates to discover what governance works best.”An illustration of the dual-facing ""tech stack.""ToIP’s protocol is dual-facing in the sense that the governance framework reinforces the technical framework. From here, you can have a tech stack like blockchain, but in truth it could be any distributed database that can create cryptographic proof. Once you have this proof, then you need an additional layer to link the proof with DID ownership. Under ToIP’s envisioned model, the data stored in this layer could be local (like in a user’s wallet or a key store file) or in an encrypted data store with a trusted third party. Either option would create a much more private experience where users would retain more control over their data than they do under the current FAANG infrastructure. From here, the challenge, of course, is figuring out what the secret recipe is for providing this solution. How to ensure that developers are building systems that ensure client data is stored securely isn’t exactly novel, but figuring out which blockchain or distributed database will provide the technical layer for this project is the largest unknown.So first things first, ToIP will be “a place of learning,” John said, to explore which available solutions (and there are several) will work best in tandem with governance models to find the right fit for the internet’s missing identity layer.Perhaps in the future you will be able to store your ID locally on a digital wallet. At the very least, ToIP believes, you should have the right to choose how it is stored, where it is stored, and who has access to it."

And Blockchain",https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2020/04/21/how-to-improve-the-financial-services-industry-with-artificial-intelligence-and-blockchain/,,"<div class=""content-data light-text""><span class=""hidden pageviews-wrapper""></span><time>Apr 21, 2020,</time><span class=""time""><time>07:15am EDT</time></span></div>",Photo:,"Blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) solve different tasks, but they can work together to improve many processes in the financial services industry, from customer service to loan application reviews and payment processing.Adopting AI and blockchain technologies can make your financial sector smarter and help it to perform more effectively. Blockchains can provide transparency and data aggregation; they also enforce contract terms. Meanwhile, AI can automate decision-making and improve internal bank processes.Here are several ways blockchain and AI technologies can revolutionize the financial industry.Currently, opening an investment account can take several days, because banks need to collect information from various sources about their clients. A blockchain can store all customer information in one place, while AI-driven algorithms can quickly analyze that information and make unbiased decisions. As a result, financial institutions can offer personalized services to more clients faster, more securely and more efficiently.For instance, the Luvo service chatbot and the KAI-based bot were successfully implemented for reducing customer queries. Using these AI-powered services, bank clients can get answers on their simple questions and can automate daily tasks, like money transfers, account reviews and reporting.Time is money. But bank transactions are still slow and costly. In contrast, blockchain-based cross-border payments are inexpensive and fast, because they don’t require third-party authorization.Just compare the 2% to 3% remittance costs for blockchain transactions with the 5% to 20% withheld by traditional banks. In terms of speed, the number of confirmed Bitcoin transactions per second reached 3.8 in March 2020, while its highest rate was 4.7 in mid-December 2017.AI technologies can further increase transaction speeds by reducing the need for human input, and banks can automate payment workflows by applying image recognition to financial documents and using natural language processing to support payments via voice assistants.According to the United Nations, the amount of money laundered globally varies between $800 billion and $2 trillion per year. However, a combination of blockchains and AI could bring money laundering to an end.Blockchains ensure data transparency and traceability, giving regulators and law enforcement all the information they need for audits. Additionally, the use of smart contracts can prevent clients from providing false data and banks from changing their contract terms.AI-based technologies can validate client transactions against payment fraud in real time, and AI-based behavior analytics can enable financial institutions to respond in near real time to insider security incidents.When implementing innovative technologies like blockchains and AI systems, the most valuable advice is not to hurry. “Move fast and break things” is not the best option for financial institutions.Scope creep is another challenge that often comes with blockchain and AI-related projects. Known as a startup killer, scope creep reduces the chance of your project being completed on time. You need to find a balance between the right amount of testing, the scope of your project, and your deadlines. Only thorough planning and project management can help you cope with all these challenges.If you need to integrate your solution into an existing banking system, you should also consider bank-specific processes before initiating product development.You should spend the same time and effort testing and analyzing the system as you spend on developing it. Otherwise, you risk suffering huge losses from system defects that could have been detected before the product release.Recently, my company leveraged AI and blockchain technologies for a loan servicing solution. To issue thousands of loans every day, banks need reliable data storage and systems that can quickly process large numbers of client requests. My team had to make sure our client’s system was efficient and secure to deflect scam attempts.Using blockchain, our client’s bank can establish loan conditions, set the validity period for loan applications, and process loan requests into smart contracts that are saved on-chain. Using AI, it can improve its loan request analysis processes and make its loan approval system more flexible and less biased.To build this system, we spent a lot of time planning the application architecture and establishing the principles of component-to-component interactions. These were the biggest challenges of this project.We chose the Ethereum blockchain because it's easy to use for developing a proof of concept and because apps built around it can quickly be adjusted for other networks later on. Ethereum can confirm only dozens of transactions per second, while more powerful networks can confirm thousands. But for this stage of the project, speed was not the priority.The artificial neural network we built achieved 95% accuracy in predicting loan repayment. In 5% of cases, approved lenders didn’t repay their loans. These were false positives. It’s also possible that the AI system produces false negatives, rejecting clients who would have returned the money.AI and blockchain technology can revolutionize critical processes in the financial services industry. However, these technologies have to be carefully calibrated and integrated with existing operations. The low level of dependence between blockchain and AI technologies is helpful, as you can begin by introducing only one of these technologies to your banking processes. This will allow you to focus on the most important things, such as creating a clear road map, developing an MVP and introducing your product to the market faster than your competitors."

Unsurprisingly, in among those messages are various threats seeking to catch us unaware. Malicious links and phishing attacks have also spiralled, as threats actors leverage the pandemic for financial gain.In among the noise, the latest warning from the research team at Check Point has added spice. It is for a dangerous malware attack that locks Android users out of their phones, encrypting their data, demanding a ransom to undo the damage. Such mobile ransomware is unusual, but a real menace when it strikes. That’s the bad news—the good news is that it can be stopped in its tracks. Details below.So, how does this attack work? The malware in question is Black Rose Lucy, operated by a Russian threat group first seen in 2018. This malware as a service was developed with evolution in mind. Originally a packaged dropper and command and control server, Lucy has been repurposed. “The ransomware is fully functional,” Check Point’s Aviran Hazum tells me, “with the capability to actually decrypt the files. That puts it out there.” He means it’s pushing the envelope, introducing a level of attack sophistication.Lucy is being shared over social messaging, disguised as a video media player. On launching, the player asks users to enable a “video streaming optimiser.” This is the weapon. Users must not enable this service. It’s a trick to grant the malware access to the device’s accessibility service. Lucy then uses this access to grant itself administrative privileges on the device—Check Point describes this misuse of accessibility services as “Android’s Achilles Heel.” Once done, the attack begins.Do NOT update this setting.Syncing with its command and control server, keeping the device awake and its WiFi connected, Lucy begins encrypting all the user’s files. Each step is checked before it moves on. “When the malware has finished encrypting the files on the device and performed all the checks to verify the files are encrypted successfully,” Check Point explains, “it displays a ransom note in the browser window.”And that demand also has an interesting twist. “The ransom note pretends to be an official message from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), accusing the victim of possessing pornographic content on his device. As a result, all content on the device is encrypted and locked.”Hazum says the use of the FBI angle is “a clear scare tactic.” So now we have a frightened user with a locked device. According to Check Point, the ransom note even warns the victim that their details have been uploaded to the FBI’s Cyber Crime Departments Data Center, “accompanied by a list of legal offenses that the victim is accused of committing.” All will be well, though. Paying a fine of $500 by credit card will restore the device. Turning to credit cards instead of bitcoin reinforces the legitimacy of the warning.Ransom note.Check Point says it has found 80 of these new Lucy samples, all of which “disguised themselves as harmless-looking video player applications,” and all of which used the same accessibility services trick to install their payloads.There’s a short-term warning here from Check Point—don’t enable that “video streaming optimizer,” don't be caught out. But there’s a longer-term issue as well. “We have not yet seen many mobile ransomware variants out there,” Check Point says, “but we have seen an evolution. Mobile ransomware is getting more and more sophisticated and efficient, as shown by Lucy. Sooner or later, the mobile world will experience a major destructive ransomware attack.”Hazum reinforces this when we speak. “Threat actors are constantly expanding their victim-pools,” he says. “I believe we will see a major development in infection methods in the next few years.”"

Also called quantum-resistant or post-quantum, this next generation of cryptography will be designed to withstand a quantum computer-based attack.","“Cryptography is the last line of defense when it comes to protecting data across every organization’s applications and communications platforms, as well as storage systems,” said Dr. Mathias Kohler, research manager at SAP 
 
SNAP
 Security Research. “Companies can’t wait for quantum computers to emerge. They need to estimate the potential impact and develop mitigation strategies early.”Organizations have a precious window of opportunity to prepare for quantum computers with quantum-safe cryptography.According to experts, quantum computers will be able to calculate the prime factors of an integer much faster than classical computers, posing a fundamental threat to many currently secure software applications on the planet. As scary as that prospect sounds, it’s important to remember that quantum computers with sufficient power don’t exist yet. That gives organizations a precious window of opportunity to be prepared for cryptography 2.0.Strong business case for being preparedCurrent state-of-the-art cloud-based computing may be safe for the moment, but infinitely more vulnerable when more powerful quantum computers take hold. For example, quantum-safe cryptography is central to preventing corporate data espionage of everything from proprietary ingredients and formulas, to differentiating processes and valued business relationships. “Every serious software vendor today needs to investigate how they will address the upcoming quantum computing cryptography challenge,” said Kohler. “Criminals could collect all the currently encrypted data and wait until quantum computing is available and exploit it then. Organizations have to look ahead and prepare for the next generation of encryption to prevent this.”He added that quantum computing also challenges the viability of blockchain and bitcoin, which rely on signature-based cryptography. Some experts believe it would render current blockchain technology obsolete.Exploration for future-proof software Industry organizations worldwide are working on standardization efforts, experimenting with algorithms for quantum-safe cryptography. SAP is actively involved in exploring this next generation of quantum-safe encryption, specifically evaluating standardization models aligned with the company’s strategy and software applications solutions. Teams at the company have some early research results from proof of concept (POC) projects comparing the performance of quantum-safe standardization candidates to classical signature encryption.“We found that certain candidates were not appropriate for IoT-based devices due to limited computing power and storage that prevented a much longer than usual signature and public/private key from being stored on the device. Without that capability, you cannot encrypt or sign your information, making the algorithm useless,” said Tobias Dyrba, senior software engineer, SAP ASE Platform. “In other experiments, we found performance was comparable to classical encryption models.”Encryption secures customer trustWhen it comes to data security and privacy, the stakes are high in every industry. With the help of quantum computers, criminals could trigger false orders within automated systems. Manufacturers would waste resources trying to manage vast unused inventories or shipments routed to the wrong locations. Robot-intensive factories could face production line disruption when attacked by criminals using quantum computer-directed programming. Not to mention that untold damage that fraudulent, sensor-based data could inflict on farms, power plants, and chemical companies. Foundationally, secure cryptography translates to customer trust. The latest IDC survey of CEOs worldwide found that building digital trust programs was the Number One new agenda item for growth in the next five years. Some analysts view trustworthiness is a competitive advantage. Gartner

IT
 researchers predicted that in 2020, digitally trustworthy companies would generate 20 percent more online profit than those who were not. “Organizations using quantum-safe cryptography can better protect citizens against voting and tax fraud,” said Dyrba. “It will also prevent businesses from accepting and deploying fraudulent software updates from seemingly valid resources, heading off catastrophic system impact.”While there’s no definitive timeframe for quantum computers to emerge, they are certain to usher in the next generation of quantum-safe cryptography.  And that’s a data protection promise customers expect every organization to keep."

","After weeks of lockdown here in Shanghai, out of the blue, we suddenly received a humanitarian call: “Can you find a way to move 6 million coronavirus protective masks from China to the U.S. by next Tuesday?”Considering that our working lives had been reduced to a constant stream of webinars and Zoom video meetings as so much of our industry–the aviation trade and the finance that supports it–had been grounded, we were all too ready to take up the challenge.We made calls to all the usual suspects and had to ask each one at least twice whether they were quoting monthly rentals or per flight. Yes, $1.3 million was the current charter rate for a one-way load, including repositioning, between Shanghai and Los Angeles–a 300% increase from pre-crisis levels. The massive price hike was attributed to heavy demand from customers around the world and a finite supply of aircraft that cannot easily be increased and the inevitable product of outsourcing. Passenger aircraft that normally move over half of the world’s cargo are simply not flying at the moment. Cargo aircraft, which had been in the doldrums, are suddenly in high demand, and all cargo conversion slots are effectively sold out for the next 12 months. To put this in perspective, the value of the aircraft had become the equivalent of three weeks of charter revenue, fuel, landing and crew costs included. I wondered if now was the time to buy a freighter of my own. The pandemic has put deal flow in a deep freeze, with the capital markets and the once “hot” asset backed securities market having ground to a halt, with investors facing a real prospect of substantial loss, with aircraft in default having no prospect of re-leasing and no buyers. Even the most experienced and well-funded of managers are likely to struggle, and as for the rest, I am waiting for the dominos to fall. Banking finance (other than warehouse facilities that are still valid) is almost non-existent at workable rates, and the plain vanilla nature of financing these assets is a distant memory. Maybe I was bored or I needed to be involved for the greater good, but I offered to help with the mask procurement and logistics. There is definitely the sense that we are all “in this together,” running through me at present, despite my Darwinian beliefs that I so often try to pass to my offspring. So, I marched on to prove my humanitarian credentials. But little prepared me for the gold-rush mentality that had taken hold in China. I scanned the press and read up on the rush for masks; the many pitfalls of the trade. After numerous complaints emerged about personal protective equipment (PPE), the Chinese Ministry of Commerce had quickly published an approved list of suppliers, which the rest of the world quickly made rich, so my hunt quickly went off-piste. The scene reminded me of the Dutch investing in tulip bulbs, with people prepared to mortgage their futures to transfer funds to a Hong Kong bank account for an entity they did not even know the name of prior to the call. Companies that had previously dealt in stone, lighting fixtures and furniture were now traders in face masks. Alibaba even had a section for this new currency of the moment, bitcoin beware. We hired a man on the ground who arranged to visit a factory that appeared impressive on their website. He flew to the location and upon arrival at the address conveyed found himself standing in the middle of a parking garage. In front of him were 10 million masks that had been rejected by another client as they were not compliant. They were offered to us numerous times, but we opted out. One man openly admitted that the factories producing masks had effectively been given a license to print their own money. After countless calls, discussions with lawyers, accountants and friends, we finally found what felt like the sacred scrolls, 6 million masks through an agent, from a large factory. About 24 hours into the negotiation and checks by some respectable advisers, and we eventually discovered the man at the factory was in fact another broker asking us to transfer millions of dollars to seal the transaction via his Hong Kong company, but we would need to make the payment to his personal account. I am ashamed to say, that I sat through hours of calls, where we were seriously debating whether to transfer the funds before the ice around the part of the brain that reasons finally began to thaw. What tipped the scales for us to back out of the deal was not the payment mechanism, which looked as if it had been arranged by Saul Goodman, the lawyer to the mob, in Netflix’s “Better Call Saul.” The deciding factor was that the important accreditations given could not be verified. I won’t even get into the minutiae of quality, weight and number of layers of fabric used in the masks, so far as to say, I am not currently wearing one unless it’s fully vetted.The seller could not guarantee customs clearance or an export license to the U.S. There were additional layers of requirements needed, and not to mention the internal logistics issues of getting to the airport facilities on time for the delivery flight. “Nobody wants to sell to the U.S.” we were told, “too scared.” Had the President threatened sanctions? Was America being punished for something? I couldn’t understand many of the claims that were given. I do believe that much of what we heard had to do with negotiating for a better price, as the official government agencies appeared to be supportive of our efforts. At one point, we were even considering the option of flying the cargo around the world to get it into the U.S., but then discovered that it would cost $2.6 million. Soon, only the Khardasians would be able to afford these masks.So here is my advice, until more regulated factories are built locally, stay at home and wash your hands to save the economy.— With Tasos Michael, CEO of Inception Aviation Holdings Limited.

As my phone sat idle from my clients who weren’t concerned about the market shift, members of the media were eager for nuggets of sage advice that could calm the general public. As a financial planner, I’ve always tried to manage the things in my client's lives that I can control, like taxes, estate planning, and their overall decisions around investing. I’ve found that when you do this well, your clients won’t worry as much about scary times, or the kind of market turmoil we’re living through today. Today we are faced with a pandemic that the economy is ill-prepared for, and the stock market is handily wiping out those stellar 401(k) returns we’d all enjoyed. In a recent survey of 1,000 Americans from LendEDU and Pollfish, 63% of respondents said they were worried that Coronavirus and its impacts would seriously damage their retirement savings and plans, and 57% of respondents said they were worried about job security. And all this is happening in a presidential election year, which only lends additional fear and uncertainty to an already fickle market. READ MORE: If Protecting Your Money In Retirement Is A Priority, Read This In keeping with politics, times like these always remind me that the investment industry functions a lot like the Democratic and Republican parties: Two separate camps that don't work well together, and often compete with each other. Let me explain. I’ve found that financial professionals usually come from either Wall Street or from the insurance industry. Wall Street alumni believe that wealth comes from your investing prowess and your ability to grow your money in Wall Street products. The insurance industry sees things differently. In the old days, insurance offered wealth protection — if you put your money in a product and paid the appropriate fees, you gained benefits for your family and received a guaranteed contractual return. You could be comforted in knowing that you’d shifted your market risk to the insurance company. But today, public stock insurance companies have changed their priorities from protecting the insured's wealth to making profits for stockholders. It’s no wonder investors no longer trust insurance companies; the apparent conflict of interest is difficult for even the most ethical of companies to balance. Thankfully there are still mutual insurance companies and credit unions that don't directly benefit from taking risks with their investors' money. When they earn a profit, they’re contractually obligated to give it back to their policyholders. They have one interest, and that is to protect your money and meet their contractual obligations — yes, it might sound dull, but it’s comforting in this market environment.As an independent advisor, I believe that most client's portfolios need both Wall Street products and insurance industry products to function optimally. After all, you have to put your money somewhere, and I’d advise against Bitcoin just as much as I’d advise against keeping your millions under a mattress. READ MORE: The Next Recession Is Coming. Here’s How To Protect Your Portfolio Going back to the concept of focusing on the things we can control, it’s important to point out that the stock market is not (and has never been) one of them. The stock markets' very nature — it’s very function, even — is to shift corporate risk to company shareholders, and spread the “burden” of ownership around. There are some huge potential upsides; investors just have to be willing to ride out the valleys in the market and not get burned by emotional reactions. It’s always the long-haul investors who walk away as winners. In my 40 years as a Certified Financial Planner, I’m now facing my eighth market meltdown. I can only hope that new generation of financial advisors understands that the difference between what they can and can’t control. As financial advisors, I believe our job is to help our clients make the best decisions and help them protect the wealth they create — not risk it unnecessarily in the market. It is in these scary times that investors crave certainty. My hope is that both Wall Street investment advisors and insurance industry professionals can reach across the aisles to enable a more ready blending of these properties in clients’ portfolios. It truly is the best of both worlds.As for all those questions I’ve been getting from the press the last few weeks, the answer from me (and from every other advisor at my firm) won’t change: There will always be scary times. The secret to investment success is to do precisely the opposite of what your emotions are telling you. It might be too late to react to today’s market volatility. But it’s never too late to make a plan for next time. And there certainly will be a “next time.”"
