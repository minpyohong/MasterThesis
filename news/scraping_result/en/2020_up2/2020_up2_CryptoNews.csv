May 04, 2020
","This past week, we saw a strong upward move in bitcoin price above the USD 8,850 resistance area. BTC/USD even surpassed the USD 9,200 resistance and traded close to USD 9,500. Recently, it started a downside correction below USD 9,000 and it could correct further towards USD 8,550 or USD 8,200.","Similarly, most major altcoins started a corrective decrease, including ethereum, XRP, litecoin, bitcoin cash, BNB, EOS, TRX, ADA, and XLM. ETH/USD broke the USD 212 support and it is currently (08:30 UTC) testing the USD 200 support zone. XRP/USD is also sliding and it seems like the bears aim a test of USD 0.200 before a fresh increase.Total market capitalization After a strong rise, bitcoin price  failed to continue above the USD 9,450 and USD 9,500. As a result, BTC/USD started a downside correction and declined below the USD 9,000 pivot level. The price is now trading below the USD 8,850 support and it might find support near the USD 8,550 weekly support. Any further losses might call for a test of USD 8,200.
Once the current correction is over, the price could start a fresh increase above USD 8,850 and USD 9,000. To start a fresh rally and a steady increase, the price must climb above USD 9,200.Ethereum price  topped near the USD 228 level and declined below the USD 220 level. ETH/USD even broke the USD 212 support and it is now struggling to stay above the USD 200 weekly support. Any further losses might lead it towards the USD 192 level.
On the upside, an initial resistance is near the USD 208 level. The main weekly resistance is now near USD 220, above which ETH might rally towards USD 250.Bitcoin cash price  struggled to stay above the USD 260 level and recently declined more than 7%. BCH/USD is now trading below the USD 245 level and it seems like there could be more losses towards the USD 220 support level. On the upside, the main weekly resistance is now near USD 265.
Litecoin  started a major decline from the USD 50.50 and USD 50.00 resistance levels. LTC/USD traded below the USD 48.50 support and tested USD 46.20. It seems like the price might decline further towards USD 45.00 before a fresh increase. Any further losses could lead LTC towards USD 42.00.
XRP price  faced a strong selling interest near the USD 0.235 level, resulting in a drop below the USD 0.225 support. The price even traded below USD 0.215 and it could dive further below USD 0.210. The main weekly supports are seen near the USD 0.202 and USD 0.200 levels.In the past three sessions, a few small-capitalization altcoins gained more than 10%, including HOT, ZIL, HYN, and HIVE. Conversely, QNT, DATA, CKB, LEND, MAID, SNT, ZEN, SC, ELF, and GNT are down more than 8%.Overall, bitcoin price is currently correcting lower from well above USD 9,000. BTC/USD could decline further towards USD 8,550 or USD 8,200 before the bulls take a stand. To start a fresh increase, the price must rise steadily above USD 9,000 and USD 9,200.

May 06, 2020
","As Bitcoin (BTC) halving approaches, there's been a great debate over the results of the past two halvings compared to this third. Digital asset management firm CoinShares looked into the most popular BTC halving hypotheses to see how likely are they to occur in their opinion, and what their impact on the price of BTC would be.","Likelihood: Highly likely
Impact: PositiveThis is the CoinShares research team's choice of what is most likely to occur. If there's no significant price rise once halving happens, the equipment of all but ""a tiny handful of the most extreme low-cost electricity miners"" will become obsolete, and as these make the switch over the next year or so, the overall cost-basis for the mining industry will be ""significantly lowered,"" according to Christopher Bendiksen, Head of Research at the company. Miners will, therefore, be able to sell less of their ongoing production to cover costs. ""The pairing of a 50% reduction in available new supply with a reduction in the proportion of ongoing supply offered for sale in the market might drastically reduce the persistent selling pressure caused by miners."" Bendinksen concludes that these dynamics, in combination with the macroeconomic tailwinds presented by global governments, and the existing and growing inflows into passive bitcoin investment products, could cause a perfect storm for the bitcoin price over the mid- to long-term.Likelihood: Likely
Impact: MinimalUnlike sudden price crashes, halvings are known in advance giving time for miners to prepare. If we take that daily volatility between 1% - 5% in BTC price is ordinary, then it's likely no major immediate impact on the price will be noticed, while any effect on the supply and demand balance may take time to be seen. There may be a short-term downwards pressure on prices as miners use reserves to cover potential revenue losses, but ""this pressure should be more steady and well-balanced than what we observe during large drawdowns in price."" Likelihood: Somewhat likely; more impactful in combination with #4
Impact: NegativeIf BTC price is higher than miners' return on investment-breakeven mining costs, there's no need to sell their coins continuously which can have a positive impact on BTC price. It BTC price is lower, however, miners have to continue selling the coins they mine, and even dip into their reserves, and this can result in additional selling pressure. But, as said, all halvings are known already. Unlike a sudden 50% crash, the halving ""reduce[s] new flow by 50%, thereby providing significant relief on persistent selling pressure even if miners must dip into reserves during a limited transition period.""Likelihood: Somewhat likely
Impact: NegativePer this hypothesis, the current price has ""significant speculative demand"" added to it, given all the bullish expectations of halvings. Yet, the Litecoin (LTC) halving in 2019 saw two thirds of its pre-halving price shaved off - though, importantly, BTC too went through a large sell-off then, and LTC correlates with BTC. There's simply not enough data for this scenario. CoinShare's believes it to be likely that there is ""at least some speculative demand"" added by the halving narrative, but ""that flipping this demand into supply in and of itself is unlikely to cause a large price decrease.""Likelihood: Plausible, but major questions remain unanswered 
Impact: Very positiveAccording to the stock-to-flow (S2F) model, when a halving happens, the stock-to-flow ratio doubles and the model price increases. While the model may potentially be accurate, and the supply reduction is likely to impact BTC supply-side positively, Bendiksen is ""not convinced that the supply reduction in itself is enough to materially impact the bitcoin price."" As reported, a new twist of the S2F model has recently been published by the model’s pseudonymous creator Plan B. And judging from the updated model, S2F believers may now hope that BTC will hit almost USD 300,000 in a few years.Likelihood: Zero
Impact: Catastrophic The theory goes like this: a large reduction in mining reward leads to mining unprofitably and to miners immediately capitulating, while the reduction of hashrate, or the computational power of the network, causes the block frequency to grow until the next block is many hours or forever away; the system becomes less useful, and the price drops further, eventually reaching zero. Though a truly scary scenario, ""we’ve already seen two halvings and several price drops of more than 80%, we can be fairly certain it will likely never actually happen."" If nothing else, then shutting down the large mining enterprise would take weeks or months to happen. The logistics simply wouldn't allow an immediate shutdown. ""In the absence of a large spike in bitcoin prices, a [mining] difficulty decrease is a highly likely outcome of this halving,"" the Head of Research concludes, adding that ""a mining death spiral, under any actually realistic scenario, is not,"" The third Bitcoin mining reward halving is estimated to happen on May 11 or May 12. At pixel time (11:49 UTC), BTC trades at USD 9,185 and is up by 3% in a day and 13% in a week. The price increased by 29% in a month and 54% in a year.

","The price of bitcoin (BTC) is once again seeing strong gains in the crypto market today, after soaring to levels not seen since before crypto’s “Black Thursday” on March 12, and again positioning the asset above a key technical level in the chart. (Updated at 14:50 UTC, when BTC trades at USD 8,338: updates in bold.)","As of press time (11:40 UTC), bitcoin is up by 4.55% to a price of USD 8,150. The price means that the number one cryptocurrency today has finally broken above the 8,000 mark, which happened to also coincide with the widely followed 200-day moving average level. If the price closes above both of these levels, technical analysis suggests that bullish momentum is strong and that further gains may be ahead of us.Following the latest price gains, bitcoin has now recovered all of its losses from the severe decline on March 12 and 13, often referred to as crypto’s “Black Thursday,” which brought it down nearly 50%.

For instance, Bloomberg editor Joe Weisenthal noted today that “Bitcoin continues to basically track S&P futures,” although with a “higher beta,” meaning volatility.Bitcoin continues to basically just track S&amp;P futures. (Higher beta though) https://t.co/0yWrj7zn2MWhatever the case may be, it is clear that today’s bitcoin strong rally has by far outperformed the stock market, with S&P 500 futures currently indicating an open a mere 0.88% higher.“The Bitcoin halving in under two weeks may explain some of the bullish activity by speculators,” Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda, wrote in a note, quoted by Bloomberg. “But you have to think that an event that has been in the diary for so long will already be priced in. This could see some of these moves faded as we hit halving day.”
Meanwhile, Christel Quek, Chief Commercial Officer and Co-founder at Bolt Global, told Bloomberg that while BTC should rise into USD 10,000s after the halving, it could be followed with a price drop as investors engage in profit taking as “no level of technical support can stand when the economy is drained.”

","In the past few hours (08:30 UTC), bitcoin price showed signs of bullish continuation at the USD 9,000 level. Should BTC/USD move towards the USD 9,200 resistance, it could continue to rise towards the USD 9,500 level. If not, the price might correct lower towards USD 8,850 or even USD 8,550.","Looking at most major altcoins, there were broad range moves in ethereum, XRP, litecoin, bitcoin cash, BNB, EOS, TRX, ADA, and XLM. ETH/USD remained stable above USD 200 and it is facing hurdles near the USD 210 and USD 212 resistance levels. XRP/USD is also trading in a range between USD 0.210 and USD 0.220.Total market capitalization Recently, bitcoin price  settled above the USD 8,850 resistance level. BTC/USD is now fluctuating around USD 9,000 and might move towards the main USD 9,180 and USD 9,200 resistance levels. A successful close above USD 9,200 could lead the price towards the USD 9,500 resistance zone.
If the bulls fail to clear the USD 9,200 resistance, there is a risk of a fresh downside correction towards the USD 8,850 level. The main support on the downside is near the USD 8,550 level. Ethereum price  is trading above the USD 202 and USD 200 support levels. ETH/USD is currently rising and approaching the range resistance at USD 210 and USD 212. A clear break above USD 212 is needed for a push towards the USD 220 level.
Conversely, the price might struggle to continue above USD 212. In the mentioned case, it could retreat lower and revisit the USD 200 support zone.Bitcoin cash price  made many attempts to settle above the USD 250 range resistance, but it failed. If BCH/USD continues to struggle near the USD 250 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. An initial support is near the USD 240 level, below which it could retest USD 230. On the upside, the price may perhaps rise towards the USD 265 resistance if it clears the USD 250 resistance.
Litecoin  is showing positive signs above the USD 45.00 and USD 46.50 levels. However, LTC/USD is facing a major hurdle near the USD 48.50 and USD 50.00 levels. A daily close above the USD 50.00 level could start a major uptrend. On the downside, the key supports for the current wave is near the USD 44.50 level.
XRP price  is trading in a positive zone above the USD 0.215 and USD 0.212 levels. If the bulls gain bullish momentum above the USD 0.220 and USD 0.222 resistance levels, there could be a strong upward move. The next major resistance is seen near the USD 0.235 level.In the past three sessions, many smaller altcoins gained more than 5%, including RDD, CHZ, DGB, SNT, NMR, SNX, ZIL, SC, ENJ, REN, UBT, and CKB. Overall, bitcoin is trading in a positive zone around the USD 9,000 pivot level. However, BTC bulls need to gain strength for a push above USD 9,200. If not, there is a risk of a bearish reversal towards the USD 8,850 and USD 8,550 support levels.

","Four days before the next Bitcoin (BTC) mining difficulty adjustment, the previously estimated all-time high is nowhere in sight. Not only will there not be a new record, but along with the falling hashrate, the difficulty is now expected to drop. ","Major Bitcoin mining pool BTC.com's latest estimation is that after two consecutive increases the difficulty will correct lower by 0.64% on May 5 to 15.86 T (11:52 UTC). Ten days ago, it was estimated that Bitcoin difficulty adjustment, which is a measure showing how hard it is to compete for mining rewards, would reach a new all-time high during the next difficulty adjustment. As a reminder, the difficulty back on April 21 reached its biggest rise in six months, going up 8.45% to 15.96 T. Back then, the estimates were that it would rise more than 8% again to 17.29 T. But now, just four days away from that next adjustment, this no longer appears to be the case and is unlikely to happen, especially when taking into account the the fact that hashrate, the computational power of the Bitcoin network, is dropping as well - now standing at 111.17 EH/s. Bitcoin hashrateAlso, it is the last adjustment before the Bitcoin minig reward halving event, expected to happen on May 12. Therefore, lower mining difficulty would somewhat help compensate for the loss of a substantial share of the mining revenue. At the same time, the price of BTC has been increasing over the course of the past week and even month making mining more profitable. At pixel time (11:52 UTC), BTC trades at USD 9,081 and is up by 2% in a day and by 20% in a week. The price went up 42% in a month and 65% in a year.Bitcoin mining profitability USD/Day for 1 THash/s, 7-day simple moving averageMeanwhile, a month ago, analysts at major crypto exchange Kraken warned investors to keep an eye out on the possible miner capitulation, despite April being historically been the second-best performing month for Bitcoin. The analysts explained that higher BTC prices are a must for miners to stay in business, and that even sideways price action could be enough to push the unprofitable miners out of the market. This dynamic will be worsened by the halving should price fail to trend higher, they said."

","Bitcoin (BTC)’s usage in Argentina may not be connected with a desire to buy fiats like the United States dollar, says an industry expert, who says that Argentinians could well have more nuanced reasons for snapping up vast quantities of the world’s favorite cryptocurrency in recent weeks.","As reported last month, after trading volumes rose on peer-to-peer (P2P) platform LocalBitcoins, Open Money Initiative contributor Matt Ahlborg claimed that for most Venezuelans, bitcoin was being used as a “gateway,” and is primarily traded by the nation’s large ethnic Chinese community.But Ahlborg says that although Argentina has also seen elevated BTC trading volume on LocalBitcoins, dollar dreams are not inspiring the nation’s most recent bitcoin rush.In a blog post, Ahlborg opines that while Venezuelans “typically purchase bitcoin with bolivars in order to immediately turn around and trade them away for dollars held in offshore accounts,” this is not the case in Argentina. He writes,“In Argentina, there already exists an extensive informal infrastructure to obtain dollars through the cueva networks. Consequently, bitcoin is needed a lot less.”Cuevas, which means caves in Spanish, are illegal bureau de change outlets that can be found in most major city centers, particularly in the capital Buenos Aires. Citizens often use these to buy USD, euro and other international fiats.Instead, Ahlborg believes that Argentinians may instead be using BTC as a speculative tool. He also theorizes that Venezuelan migrant workers in Argentina might be responsible for driving up bitcoin volumes.And a third reason, and perhaps the biggest, behind the rise of BTC in Argentina, he says, are “problems endemic to Argentina,” such as “the reintroduction of capital controls.”Argentina’s financial crisis continues to deepen, with international creditors earlier this month reject a debt offer, per the Financial Times. The nation has defaulted on loans worth over USD 500 million, and high inflation has dogged the country’s fiat peso for several months.Ahlborg concludes that bitcoin’s fate in Argentina will depend on whether the government decides to crackdown on cuevas, and whether Buenos Aires decides to “lay on new capital controls or back off and let free markets reign.”"

","A new token that allows traders to get short exposure to bitcoin (BTC) without actually shorting the asset has just been announced, with the company behind the innovation saying more tokens are to be rolled out soon as part of what it calls “a new paradigm in cryptocurrency investing.”","The new token, dubbed BTCSHORT, was announced by the issuing company Amun today, Wednesday, and aims to offer traders a way to get the “inverse return of bitcoin for a single day.” In other words, the token will be worth more as bitcoin falls in price, and vice versa. Unlike some other derivatives on the market, Amun’s BTCSHORT token is not leveraged, although it’s still designed primarily for shorter holding periods of less than one day due to the daily rebalancing required for such derivatives.The chart below shows the performance of BTCSHORT if it was bought on March 11 and then sold at the end of March 12, when the crypto market crashed:According to Amun, the new token, which is built as a standard ERC-20 token on the Ethereum (ETH) network, can be purchased on other crypto platforms like Liquid, Bitcoin.com, and HitBTC, Amun states on its website.In addition to the short BTC token already launched, Amun says it is already looking at creating derivatives products for other digital assets. CEO of Amun, Hany Rashwan, told Coindesk that tokens that track the inverse of other cryptocurrencies will also be launched soon, with an inverse token for ETH being planned for the coming weeks.The new token comes after Binance in March decided to delist several similar tokens that provided leveraged exposure both on the long and short side to cryptoassets like bitcoin, ethereum, EOS, BNB, and XRP, with CEO Changpeng Zhao then arguing that “users don't understand them.”Amun also stressed that BTCSHORT “is strictly not a security, carries many risks, and is not suitable for risk-averse token holders and traders. This type of token is best suited for sophisticated, highly risk-tolerant token holders.”The company is part of the larger Switzerland-based 21Shares brand, which has made a name for itself in the industry as an issuer of crypto-tracking exchange-traded products (ETPs) that are publicly traded on several stock exchanges throughout Europe.

","Another prominent Bitcoin bull is tipping bitcoin (BTC) to reach a price of USD 1 million within the next few years, just over a year IBM’s former head of crypto made a similar prediction, following on from eccentric tech magnate John McAfee, who has famously predicted BTC will hit this meteoric landmark by the end of 2020. ","The latest claims come from Raoul Pal, formerly of GLG Partners. Pal is now working as the CEO of Global Macro Investor, which recently produced a 120-page report on the state of (and the future of) investment.Pal predicts that the conventional economic system of money “fail more or less dramatically” in a “long, drawn-out bleed,” that will involve it “without becoming more of a Frankenstein’s monster.” He writes,“[Cash] is already is a deformed beast after the last crisis and barely functions.”Bitcoin, he says, will come to the rescue, as will gold, which he claims is working well against all global currencies and “will continue to do so.”He notes,“Gold is the protection of our assets. Bitcoin is the call option on the future system. Both are going to save us and probably make us rich.”In terms of concrete predictions, Pal claims that gold “can go up 3x or 5x in the next three to five years” – and says he thinks BTC “can get to USD 1m in the same period.”He enthuses,“Bitcoin is nothing short of the future of our entire medium of the exchange system, and of money itself and the platform on which it operates.”Pal then goes on to rave about altcoins, central bank digital currencies and tokens such as Facebook’s Libra project.“All of that combined,” he states, “will be the next USD 100tn+ financial system.” Bitcoin, says Pal, was built to thrive in the most challenging of times.He writes,“[Bitcoin] was born out of the financial crisis for exactly what is about to come in this crisis. This is literally what bitcoin was invented for.”Pal doesn’t stop there. He writes,“I think it hits USD 100,000 in the next two years alone. But it could go to USD 1m in the same time period.”Pal concludes by suggesting that everyone “needs to have bitcoin,” and suggests the following portfolio makeup:“The allocation I am personally aiming for, on my total available liquid assets, is 25% trading investments, 25% cash (all USD), 25% gold, 25% bitcoin. I’m putting my money where my mouth is.”However, in a somewhat deflationary disclaimer after all this dizzying rhetoric, he adds,“I want to be clear that forecasting out beyond a few months is a complex and risky affair in an environment like this. […] I can only offer what I think is the most likely outcome at this stage. I think I’m going to be right, but I sure as hell don’t know it. But I’d give it a 60%+ chance.”“Let’s see how this all pans out,” he concludes.Stay tuned to Cryptonews.com to see if Pal’s bold predictions do indeed come true."

April 22, 2020
","Although holders of both bitcoin (BTC) and gold are often motivated by an idea of investing in assets that are outside of the financial system, it might not be the case, according to a popular macro strategist who believes that that the next world reserve currency will be “a crypto.”","Speaking with Anthony Pompliano, Morgan Creek Digital Co-founder and the host of Pomp Podcast, Jim Bianco, President and Macro Strategist at Bianco Research, a macro investment analysis firm, said that bitcoin does have potential to be a real hedge against the current system, but that would first require adoption by merchants, making it possible to “do something real” with the bitcoin.Speaking about bitcoin as a medium of exchange, Bianco said “I can’t do anything with it until I change it back to dollars and buy groceries with it, so I’m still kind of stuck in the same system that I’m trying to get out of,” referring to the fact that most merchants still don’t accept bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies as payment.However, Bianco also made it clear that bitcoin still has potential if real-world adoption increases:“When I can do something real with it, outside of the financial system, then you’ve got something […] that would really be the game-changer.”Despite not being overly enthusiastic about bitcoin at present, however, Bianco did say that he believes the next world reserve currency after the US dollar “will be a crypto.”“For a half-second, I thought maybe Libra will do it,” Bianco admitted, before explaining how it represented too big of a threat to government fiat currencies to be accepted by the same governments “because they were afraid of what Libra represented.” He went on to say that although the next reserve currency will be a crypto,“it probably doesn’t exist yet.”Bianco continued by explaining that the next reserve currency needs to be both a medium of exchange and a store of value, which in his view bitcoin is not. “Bitcoin might be a good store of value, but it’s not a really good medium of exchange,” he said. In either case, the strategist is not entirely correct when he says that he can’t do anything with BTC. Just recently, analysts at blockchain analytics specialist Chainalysis were surprised by the resilience of the bitcoin merchant services amid the coronavirus-caused economic crisis.The analysts said that one reason behind the smaller than expected drop in merchant services activity could be that people have continued using their crypto to buy through merchant services those essentials that they can’t buy elsewhere with fiat.However, on a global scale, BTC is not ready to replace fiat money, Dominik Stroukal, Economics Expert at SatoshiLabs, the manufacturer of the Trezor wallet, said in a separate blog post yesterday.""At least not yet. It does not have the capacity and infrastructure to do so. You cannot have exaggerated expectations. However, cryptocurrencies change every day for the better. The technology is evolving, and privacy and security are getting better every day,"" he said, adding that a crisis like the current one attracts people to seek alternatives and accelerates the development.Meanwhile, Bianco also drew a similar conclusion on gold, saying that people who buy gold because they believe inflation or other “bad things” are going to happen to the financial system should keep in mind that they are not really getting out of that system, unless they own physical gold, e.g., in coins. “That is the problem that gold has right now […] it’s not as separate as people make it out to be,” he said, while explaining that gold is subject to the volatility of the traditional financial system via its futures contracts traded on the COMEX and other futures exchanges, and via the popular GLD exchange-traded fund traded on the New York Stock Exchange.

","Although Bitcoin (BTC) first hit the mainstream as a sort of anonymous Internet currency that allowed people to order drugs via darknet markets like Silk Road, the reality is transactions made on the network are completely public. Indeed, the current level of privacy offered by Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrency networks is far from ideal, although there have been a number of improvements, such as CoinJoin, implemented over the years.","While the nature of Bitcoin makes it difficult to implement changes quickly, some developers think the Liquid sidechain built on the Bitcoin network by Canada-based major blockchain company Blockstream has the potential to improve privacy for BTC users. However, others see the sidechain, which runs on a model of “federated custody,” as mostly uninteresting from a cypherpunk perspective.Though the Lightning Network has received much more attention as an additional protocol layer for Bitcoin over the past few years, the data shows that Liquid is now leading in terms of BTC held on this sidechain.BTC held on Liquid__
BTC held on public Lightning Network channelsFor a number of years, the Holy Grail for Bitcoin privacy has been theorized as a combination of two privacy features: Confidential Transactions is not currently available on Bitcoin’s main chain, so the most productive CoinJoin implementations force users to use equal amounts when mixing their transactions. After all, if users were mixing transactions involving varying amounts of BTC, it would be trivial for an adversary to construct a transaction graph by matching the inputs with the outputs of a particular CoinJoin transaction.“It’s very difficult to do a CoinJoin in a way that improves privacy, and it’s also very difficult to measure how much privacy we get,” Andrew Poelstra, Director of Research at Blockstream, explained back in 2016. “By hiding amounts, we allow combining transactions in a way that we no longer have this clear correlation.”Liquid is a federated sidechain, meaning that a group of trusted, known functionaries process transactions, rather than proof-of-work miners. It’s mostly focused on enabling faster transactions between exchanges and improving privacy for traders. The sidechain already offers a form of Confidential Transactions, known as Confidential Assets. In addition to masking the amounts involved in transactions, Confidential Assets also hides the type of asset that is being transferred. For example, when looking at the data available on the blockchain, an observer cannot tell if a user is sending L-BTC or the tether (USDT) stablecoin to another address.However, a CoinJoin implementation is not yet available for Liquid, which means it’s still easy to see that address A sent some kind of payment to address B.The lack of CoinJoin availability for Liquid could have something to do with how privacy-focused developers view the federated sidechain. While developers for Samourai Wallet and Wasabi Wallet haven’t always seen eye to eye, both parties have similar feelings regarding the use of Liquid to gain better privacy.“Samourai is bitcoin only and resolutely on-chain with a focus on on-chain privacy,” said the pseudonymous Samourai Wallet developer known as TDevD. “As BTC on Liquid is an IOU and subject to federation review on peg-out, it is not a sovereign instrument that we would be interested in handling. Samourai has always refused to develop anything less than non-custodial.”TDevD added that this sort of reasoning is also behind Samourai Wallet’s lack of exchange integration, which would require users to turn over personal data due to various “Know Your Customer” regulations. To TDevD’s point, the introduction of any form of custody over user assets gives regulators a centralized point of failure to target with onerous regulations, licensing requirements, or complete shutdown.Wasabi Wallet’s Adam Fiscor shared a similar lack of interest in dealing with the Liquid sidechain.“I'm not interested in Liquid as it isn't a replacement for Bitcoin, but rather, it is a good alternative to on-chain payments for a small subset of Bitcoin users,” said Fiscor. “[However], adding privacy to Liquid is obviously better than not.”TDevD took their criticism of Liquid further, stating that the current privacy benefits of the sidechain are overblown.“Confidential Transactions, as implemented within Liquid, hides amounts and asset types but not addresses,” explained TDevD. “For peg-ins and peg-outs to and from the main chain, nothing is hidden: amounts, asset types, and addresses are all visible. Even without the use of the transaction graph, anyone using Liquid as a CoinJoin tool will be subject to amount and timing analysis. Monero, with RingCT, Ring signatures, and Stealth addresses, offers better privacy and is non-custodial.”A paper exploring this sort of amount and timing analysis problem in the Zcash privacy coin was published back in 2017 (PDF).Meanwhile, Liquid supporters think CoinJoin on Liquid is worth trying.“I see Liquid as another tool to use together with Bitcoin but without having its own native shitcoin token,” said Wiz, a longtime cypherpunk and early Bitcoin adopter who recently joined the Liquid federation. “I mean I don’t know why it’s so controversial, we’re not shitcoining or scamming people like 9000 shitcoiners do every day with their pump and dump scams.”Additionally, in terms of someone testing out CoinJoin on Liquid, Blockstream CEO Adam Back said, “I think that would be pretty cool.”Back and Wiz both pointed out that, in terms of censorship resistance, improved privacy is extremely helpful because it makes it impossible for individual transactions to be censored, as those in charge of processing transactions cannot differentiate between different payments. The regulatory scenario then becomes all or nothing. Either regulators allow the federated sidechain to exist or they attempt to shut it down completely.“Liquid is federated, but it’s a bit further along the spectrum from Bitcoin towards centralization,” said Back.That said, targeting a sufficient number of Liquid functionaries to shut down the network wouldn’t be the simplest of tasks for regulators in different jurisdictions around the world.“The exchanges that are operating Liquid nodes – the hardware security module is inside a server, which is called a functionary, so they don’t actually have any means to interfere with transactions,” added Back. “Although, to be clear, Liquid is less censorship-resistant and seizure resistant than the main chain.”According to Back, Blockstream recommends that those who are interested in long term cold storage and censorship-resistant payments should use Bitcoin’s main chain, while those who are traders or seeking better privacy may want to take advantage of the features offered by Liquid.There have been discussions around more cypherpunks, such as Wiz, starting their own separate sidechain or creating an alternative peg-in mechanism for Liquid. However, this development might introduce new challenges, according to Back. “One problem is seizability combined with the pseudonymity of individuals operating the network, and then another is operational security,” he said. “It could be that the cypherpunks have worse operational security compared to an exchange.”Still, Back says Blockstream is interested in making it easier for people to run their own federations if they wish, though he cautioned that it takes a lot of work to operate and properly maintain federations.“Think about it, if everyone made their own Bitcoin sidechains they wouldn’t be able to shut down all of them,” said Wiz. “It’s a power in numbers thing. Vires in numeris. That’s the motto of Bitcoin.”As of now, there are plenty of opinions regarding the usefulness of something like Liquid for bringing new privacy options to Bitcoin users, but nobody can really know whether this will be a worthwhile endeavor until the relevant software exists in the wild.

","The cryptocurrency-manga bond is growing stronger. While manga-flavored token monacoin (MONA) was arguably the first major crypto-manga crossover, a new series of bitcoin (BTC)-themed comics is now the talk of the town in Japan.","The new title is named Genesis Code, and is being serialized in manga magazine Young Animal, published by the Tokyo-based manga powerhouse Hakusensha.The front cover of the first edition, published on April 28, features the series’ hero holding a token emblazoned with the bitcoin logo, and the publisher has released a promotional video.Per a dedicated page on the publisher’s website, Genesis Code is set in 2009, just after the birth of bitcoin.

April 23, 2020
","Yesterday, we discussed the chances of a decent upward move in bitcoin price above the USD 7,000 resistance. BTC/USD did rise above the USD 7,000 and USD 7,050 resistance levels. It tested the USD 7,200 resistance and is currently (08:30 UTC) consolidating gains with minor corrective moves.","Similarly, there are bullish moves in most major altcoins, including ethereum, XRP, litecoin, bitcoin cash, BNB, EOS, TRX, ADA, and XLM. ETH/USD gained more than 5% and it tested the USD 185 resistance area. XRP/USD also climbed higher, but it seems to be facing a major hurdle near the USD 0.190 and USD 0.192 levels.Total market capitalization After a successful close above USD 6,850, bitcoin price  gained bullish momentum. BTC/USD surpassed the USD 7,000 and USD 7,050 resistance levels. It tested the USD 7,200 resistance and recently corrected below USD 7,120. On the downside, an initial support is near the USD 7,050 and USD 7,000 levels. The main support is now forming near USD 6,850.
On the upside, the bulls are facing a major resistance near the USD 7,200 level, above which there are high chances of a strong upward move towards the USD 7,550 and USD 7,650 levels. Ethereum price  performed well and it gained more than 5%. ETH/USD surpassed the USD 180 resistance and it tested the USD 185 level. The price is currently correcting lower towards the USD 180 and USD 178 support levels. The main support is now near the USD 175 level.
On the upside, there is a key resistance near the USD 185 level. A successful break and follow-through above USD 185 might set the pace for a decent rally towards the USD 200 level.Bitcoin cash price  settled above the USD 220 level and it is now approaching the USD 230 resistance. A clear break above the USD 230 level could set the pace for more upsides and BCH/USD might revisit the USD 245 resistance zone. The key support on the downside is near the USD 220 level.
Litecoin  is showing positive signs above the USD 40.00 level. LTC/USD surpassed the USD 41.20 resistance, but it seems to be facing hurdles near the USD 42.00 and USD 42.20 levels. The first major resistance on the upside for a larger rally is seen near the USD 44.50 level.
XRP price  also followed bitcoin and climbed higher. It surpassed the USD 0.188 level, but it struggled to surpass the USD 0.190 and USD 0.195 resistance levels. It is back at USD 0.185, below which there is a risk of a fresh decline towards the USD 0.180 level. To start a real uptrend, the price must settle above the USD 0.192 level.In the past two sessions, a few small-capitalization altcoins climbed more than 5%, including DGB, QNT, XLM, THETA, LEND, XTZ, ADA, MKR, ENJ, and CRO. Conversely, LUNA, DGD, and SXP are down more than 4%.To sum up, the recent moves in bitcoin suggest a positive trend forming above USD 6,850 and USD 7,000. Having said that, BTC/USD must gain strength above the USD 7,200 resistance area to continue higher in the near term.

April 30, 2020
","Ten days were not enough for blockchain developers to win a new Bitcoin (BTC) contest, launched by Paul Sztorc, an independent BTC researcher, and tap into a BTC 6.1 (USD 53,600) prize fund. However, contestants still have at least 12 days to go.","The contest started last week and includes potential total rewards of up to BTC 6.1 for developers who are able to successfully implement the privacy-focused cryptocurrency Zcash (ZEC) as a Bitcoin drivechain via a sidechain (a separate blockchain that is linked to the main blockchain) template.A drivechain is a type of Bitcoin sidechain where miners effectively hold the funds on the sidechain in escrow. Bitcoin users can send BTC to a drivechain, which is a completely different blockchain, to gain access to various features that are not currently available on Bitcoin’s main chain. The tradeoff is that a 51% attack on Bitcoin now means miners can steal the funds held on the drivechain.Sztorc originally announced his drivechain idea in a November 2015 blog post. The researcher worked on this project because he needed a way to implement his peer-to-peer oracle protocol known as Bitcoin Hivemind.For Sztorc, the goal of this contest is to compensate people for the time it takes to look into his drivechain project, try out the software, and build something great in the process.“[It’s also helpful] for me to learn if other people can make any sense of our sidechain template or how it works, [and we can] get more feedback about how to better run future contests,” Sztorc told Cryptonews.com.According to him, Zcash was chosen as the altcoin to implement via a sidechain template for specific reasons.“The contest pays people if they are the first to assemble a certain type of software,” said Sztorc. “Zcash was made by forking Bitcoin, so really all people have to do is exactly that, again. Then again software development is very difficult, so I have no clue at all if I've given enough time or money or what.”Sztorc said no one has successfully completed the Zcash sidechain implementation for Bitcoin at this point.Once someone is able to implement a Zcash sidechain via the drivechain software, it can be used for testing on the drivechain test network, known as DriveNet.“It is a lot like how SegNet was used to test SegWit,” said Sztorc.Once drivechain capabilities are added to Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency network, it would be able to make use of this Zcash sidechain.“It is kind of like a plugin,” added Sztorc.According to him, the drivechain code has been greatly improved in terms of the number of steps that need to be taken to create a new sidechain, as outlined in a blog post from December 2019. However, an initial soft fork is still needed to enable drivechains on Bitcoin.“So, the initial soft fork is required to enforce Drivechain, but no new bureaucratic chicanery is required to add individual sidechains,” explained the researcher.Once drivechain functionality is enabled on the Bitcoin network, each individual drivechain can be activated via approval from miners representing 95% of the network hashrate.In terms of what’s next, Sztorc stated that the soft fork code to enable drivechain-based sidechains should be finalized before anything else happens.
“We still have one or two things left to add and debug,” said Sztorc.“We still have one or two things left to add and debug,” said Sztorc."

April 30, 2020
","The sentiment among investors in several major cryptoassets is on the rise, as a growing number of hodlers are seeing positive numbers on their account balance, on-chain analysis shows.","According to data from on-chain analytics firm IntoTheBlock, more holders of bitcoin (BTC), ethereum (ETH), bitcoin cash (BCH), bitcoin SV (BSV), and litecoin (LTC) are now sitting on profits from their crypto investments.As defined by IntoTheBlock, holders that have a positive difference between the purchase price and current price are defined as being “in the money.” In cases where there is no difference, the holder is said to be “at the money,” while holders at a loss are “out of the money.”For bitcoin specifically, a positive change of 4.07% in the number of wallets “in the money” shows that this asset is again producing profits for its holders, which contributes to the overall bullish rating that IntoTheBlock gives bitcoin.Further, the underlying data shows that 75% of holders are currently (12:25 PM UTC) sitting on profits in fiat terms on their investment. Meanwhile, 19% are still “out of the money,” while 6% of holders are “at the money.” However, earlier today, when BTC was still above USD 9,000, 80% of the hodlers were profitable.Out of the five biggest cryptoassets with on-chain data available, ethereum is the most bullish asset judging from the “In the Money” signal, with a positive change of 4.1% in the number of wallets with profits. Looking at the underlying data, we can see that 45% of holders in ethereum are currently profiting, while 49% are sitting on losses, and 6% are at break-even.Ethereum also stands out as even more bullish than bitcoin from an on-chain analytics standpoint, largely due to a stronger “net network growth,” defined as the number of new addresses minus the addresses that go to zero.Moving over to bitcoin cash, we get a different picture, with an overall bearish rating being assigned the asset by IntoTheBlock. Again, the contributing factor is largely the negative network growth revealed by the analysis.However, the large majority of bitcoin cash holders that are currently seeing a positive account balance, with 85% of holders being “in the money,” and 13% being “out of the money.” Bitcoin SV is largely reflecting the same situation as bitcoin cash, with a bearish overall rating, despite the fact that there is a growing number of holders that are sitting on profits. For this asset, however, IntoTheBlock’s data shows that there has been a large decline in the number of large transactions being made over the network, which has greatly contributed to the overall bearish outlook.Based purely on the number of holders that are “in the money,” however, few assets can boast similar results as bitcoin SV, with a whopping 97% of holders currently in the green, the underlying data showed.Lastly, litecoin is looking more like bitcoin from an on-chain analysis point of view, with an overall bullish rating thanks to strong growth in the number of holders that have profited from their investment. Interestingly, however, the “silver to bitcoin’s gold” differs in the way that a far lower share of the current holders actually have made money, with only 21% of holders being “in the money.” That leaves room for a large majority of 73% of investors, who are currently sitting on unrealized losses in their litecoin wallets, which is more than for any of the other assets we have analyzed."

","Although most of the activity around bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies currently has more to do with price speculation than actual commerce, there are still plenty of reasons as to why accepting bitcoin payments makes sense for some businesses. Whether you believe in the ideas behind Bitcoin from a philosophical perspective or you just want to avoid chargebacks, there are plenty of benefits to be had from allowing your customers to pay for your goods or services via a cryptocurrency network.","BitPay and BTCPay Server are two of the most well-known options on the market in terms of enabling cryptocurrency payment acceptance for your business. However, they approach this problem from two different points of view.Incredibly, BitPay was founded in the US all the way back in 2011 by Stephen Pair and Tony Gallipi. In fact, the company was launched less than two years after the launch of the Bitcoin network itself.BitPay says its main mission is to transform the way individuals and businesses around the world receive payments through the use of blockchain technology. Many of the largest companies in the world that accept bitcoin payments, such as Microsoft and Newegg, do so via BitPay.The company has processed more than USD 2.8 billion in cryptocurrency payments over the course of its entire history. Currently, the company processes payments made with BTC, bitcoin cash (BCH), ethereum (ETH), XRP, and three different stablecoins.Over the years, BitPay has expanded into other products and services that help enable better utility for BTC and other cryptocurrencies as mediums of exchange. For example, in addition to their merchant payment processing offerings, BitPay also has a Bitcoin debit card, a Bitcoin wallet, and a number of open source tools for developers.In 2014, BitPay gained some mainstream notoriety through their sponsorship of an NCAA (the National Collegiate Athletic Association) college football bowl game; however, the company decided to promote Bitcoin rather than their company specifically through the deal. More controversially, BitPay was one of the companies that supported the so-called New York Agreement in 2017, which was an attempt to implement a hard-forking increase to Bitcoin’s block size limit to go along with the Segregated Witness (SegWit) upgrade. While many major Bitcoin miners, other large BTC companies were supporting this attempt, the majority of Bitcoin’s development community and other industry players were against it. Back then, they stressed that this scaling solution would make Bitcoin more centralized. BTCPay Server was created in 2017 by Bitcoin Core contributor Nicolas Dorier as an act of protest against BitPay’s activities around the aforementioned SegWit2x plan.@BitPay This is lies, my trust in you is broken, I will make you obsoleteBTCPay Server gives users more control over their payments than what is available with BitPay — it’s effectively a self-hosted version of BitPay. In fact, the BTCPay API conforms to BitPay’s configuration, which allows merchants to make the switch.BTCPay Server comes with a full node wallet for its users, which means the original intent of Bitcoin in terms of censorship-resistance and full control over one’s money is preserved with this payment solution.Choosing the right BTC payment processor for your business will depend on a variety of factors. Although they are attempting to solve similar issues, BitPay and BTCPay approach bitcoin payments from two very different perspectives.If you’re someone who just wants to enable BTC payments because you think it will attract new customers and you’re not actually interested in the ideas behind digital cash, then you may be better off going with BitPay. They’ll be able to turn all of your cryptocurrency payments into fiat currency, helping you avoid any volatility risk. Additionally, there is an actual company you can call for help in case anything goes wrong. (In case of BTCPay Server, you would need to ask the community for help and sometimes pay for it).If you’re more interested in Bitcoin from a philosophical point of view, then you may want to take a closer look at BTCPay Server. While the company plans to introduce crypto to fiat conversion in an unspecified future, you can already convert your cryptocurrency payments on your own without permission from a company to enable payments for a cryptocurrency that is supposed to be permissionless in nature. In other words, BTCPay Server is for people who actually have a need for a form of censorship-resistant digital cash."

","In an attempt to help Venezuelans to store their savings in a more stable currency,  Colombia-based fintech, Valiu, decided to indirectly use Bitcoin (BTC) rather than one of the many available stablecoins. There are three reasons why BTC has won in this case.","“Liquidity, business model, and regulatory advantages,” Sid Ramesh, an advisor to Valiu, an app that allows Venezuela migrants in Columbia to send money back to their home country, named the reasons in an interview with Cryptonews.com. He was unwilling to expand on the regulatory benefits of Valiu’s synthetic dollar-based system, but he did explain the importance of liquidity for their concept to work.“Liquidity is key here,” said Ramesh. “BTC is the only liquid asset in our jurisdiction. If stablecoins catch on in [Latin America], we'll use them as settlement.”Of course, Valiu’s synthetic dollar could be seen as a sort of crypto-collateralized stablecoin in its own right. But according to Ramesh, Valiu’s setup does not come with the same sorts of problems that may soon be found with more traditional stablecoins.“We will thrive even in a negative interest rate world with interest revenues since it's a function of the BTC futures curve,” said the advisor. “Stablecoin issuers who depend on interest revenues from US treasuries will have to explore new business models whereas our yields are a function of the low-risk premiums available on the BTC derivatives market (basis trades, yield on the perpetual funding rate, etc.).”As reported by Cryptonews.com, those stablecoins which rely on such rates and yields for their revenues are now in a serious bind and they will have to adapt if they want to survive the Coronavirus-prompted recession.Although Valiu uses cryptocurrency in the backend, this is hidden from the user. Let’s take a closer look at how Valiu’s synthetic US dollar works behind the scenes also.Last week, Valiu announced that it has developed a dollar savings account for their app. The app uses BTC derivatives to create a synthetic version of the US dollar, and the goal is to allow Venezuelans to store their savings in a more stable currency. “In the most simplistic form, Valiu hedges BTC to the dollar by shorting 1x on BTC futures to obtain synthetic exposure,” Ramesh explained. “The underlying profit and loss stays constant in USD value but changes for the BTC value depending on the moves in the market.”According to Ramesh, Valiu is effectively issuing USD depository receipts to its users.“The hedging and risk strategies we've developed enable us to net risk across [forex] pairs in [Colombian Peso] or [Venezuelan Bolívar] as well as BTC/USD in derivative markets,” he added.For those who are aware of the mobile crypto app Abra, these underlying mechanisms may sound similar. In the past, Abra used synthetic assets created through the use of Bitcoin multisignature addresses as the underlying source of value for the assets held in the app by its users. However, Valiu is still quite different from how Abra’s synthetic assets worked.“Unlike Abra's model which had ‘multi-sig’ enabled exposure, the BTC collateral [used in Valiu] currently sits on custodial venues,” explained Ramesh. “Abra is ‘non-custodial’, and we’re not. We're exploring other mechanisms such as proof-of-reserves and non-custodial backing to ensure Valiu becomes a full-reserve backed financial institution that's trust minimized and transparent of our solvency.”Valiu also doesn’t allow users to interact with BTC directly.“It's completely abstracted out from the user experience and we don't plan on exposing crypto to the end-user anytime soon,” said Ramesh.Currently, Valiu allows synthetic dollars to be redeemed for Colombian pesos or Venezuelan bolivars. The company has more than 30,000 on ramps and off ramps in Colombia, where physical cash, debit cards, credit cards, and bank transfers can all be used as payment methods.Users who are receiving synthetic dollars in Venezuela can withdraw them into one of nine different banks; however, the idea is Venezuelans will use the synthetic dollars as a savings account of sorts and only withdraw bolivars to their bank account when absolutely necessary for spending (in an effort to avoid exposure to the highly inflationary bolivar).

","In the past two days, there were strong bullish moves in bitcoin above USD 7,550. BTC/USD surged around 20% and surpassed many key hurdles such as USD 8,000, USD 8,500, and USD 9,000. It traded to a new monthly high close to USD 9,500 and it is currently correcting gains.
Similarly, there was a steady rise in most major altcoins, including ethereum, XRP, litecoin, bitcoin cash, BNB, EOS, TRX, ADA, and XLM. ETH/USD extended its rally above the USD 220 level and it traded close the USD 230 resistance. XRP/USD also rallied more than 10% and tested the USD 0.235 resistance zone.","Total market capitalization After a successful close above USD 8,000, bitcoin price  gained bullish momentum. BTC/USD surged around 20% and broke many resistances near USD 9,000. It even traded above the USD 9,200 resistance and tested the USD 9,500 hurdle. The price is currently (08:30 UTC) correcting gains and it could retest the USD 9,050 and USD 9,000 support levels.
On the upside, the price is likely to face a strong selling interest near USD 9,450 and USD 9,500. If there is another show of strength, the price could surge towards the USD 10,000 level. Ethereum price  extended its rally above the USD 205 and USD 220 resistance levels. ETH/USD even surpassed USD 225 and traded close to USD 228. It is currently correcting lower and approaching the USD 220 support. If there are more losses, the price may perhaps test the USD 212 support.
On the upside, the USD 225, USD 228 and USD 230 levels are key hurdles. A successful break above USD 230 might lead the price towards USD 250.Bitcoin cash price  gained more than 10% and it broke the USD 245 and USD 250 resistance levels. BCH/USD even climbed above USD 265 and tested the USD 275 zone. It is currently correcting lower to USD 265, below which the bears are likely to aim a test of the USD 250 level.
Litecoin  succeeded in gaining traction above the USD 46.50 and USD 48.50 resistance levels. LTC/USD tagged the USD 50.00 barrier and it is currently correcting lower. On the downside, the USD 48.50 level is likely to act as a strong support. On the upside, the USD 50.00 and USD 50.50 are short term hurdles, followed by USD 52.00.
XRP price  extended its rise above the USD 0.212 and USD 0.220 resistance levels. The price even climbed above USD 0.232 and tested the USD 0.235 resistance. The price is currently retreating lower and it seems like it could test the USD 0.224 support zone.In the past three sessions, many smaller altcoins rallied more than 10%, including DATA, SC, OMG, HYN, MONA, BCD, CKB, OKB, NRG, CRO, BSV, BCN, MAID, BTG, BTT, and FTT. Out of these, DATA rallied 54%.Overall, bitcoin is surging before the upcoming halving event and it is now trading above USD 9,000.

",This weekend’s big TV show event had a bitcoin (BTC) bent – with series five of Showtime’s Billions drama series focusing largely on the world’s most popular cryptocurency.,"The first episode of the series aired over the weekend in the United States. Billions began airing on Showtime in 2016, and is partially based on the life of Preet Bharara, a former New York District Attorney.But while previous seasons have focused on legal disputes with hedge fund managers and the manipulation of conventional stock markets, crypto enthusiasts were regaled by bitcoin-related themes during the season opener on May 3.Particularly of note in the episode was a plotline about a group of cryptocurrency miners, operating a massive illegal BTC farm.After arresting the miners, Billions protagonist Chuck confronts their ringleader, asking,“So your multitude of computers and servers could solve some abstract math equations resulting in the mining of bitcoin? It’s worth millions right now. Whoopee! But it’s backed by what? Nada, nix, zot.”However, the miner retorts with an astute response:“What is the dollar backed by since we went off the gold standard?""President Richard Nixon abandoned the gold standard back in 1971. And the retort appeared to flummox Chuck no end, as he began muttering somewhat vaguely about “roads, infrastructure and that sort of thing…”  (A survey in 2019 showed that 29% of surveyed Americans believe that the US dollar is still backed by gold.) Billions kicks off with Bitcoin. https://t.co/9xLMkXmZZx Many crypto enthusiasts online were certainly impressed.American author Ben Mezrich, who penned the book that Facebook-themed movie The Social Network was based on, enthused:Bitcoin on Billions! It’s beautiful, baby. :):):):)And one Redditor on the r/Bitcoin sub-Reddit stated that the episode left them feeling “kind of giddy.”However, it's not the first time crypto is mentioned on the show. In the third season, aired in 2018, ambitious hedge fund king Bobby ""Axe"" Axelrod attempted to hide his profit in crypto.Did you see the episode? What’s your take on Billions and its bitcoin theme?

April 29, 2020
","A number of Chinese media outlets have published reports outlining the central bank’s plans for the digital yuan, which is set to make its debut at testbed sites next month, with some keen to point out that the new token “is not bitcoin (BTC) or ethereum (ETH)” and will not lead to a rise in crypto in the Middle Kingdom.","Multiple reports from outlets such as Sina and Shenzhen Foresight, as well as China Trade News and the Shenzen Observer (via IT Time Net) have published reports about the central People’s Bank of China (PBoC)’s plans for the introduction of the digital yuan, known as the Digital Currency Electronic Payment (DCEP) in China.Although these reports do not really contain much in terms of new information, it is perhaps telling that they were all published within a few hours of one another, and feature assertions about how different the DCEP is from bitcoin and major altcoins.The timing of these reports may also be linked with the fact that internet searches related to bitcoin and cryptocurrency have risen fast in China since reports earlier this month confirmed that the PBoC was about to green-light DCEP testing in Beijing and other cities in May. Images of the supposedly digital yuan in a smartphone wallet have also been circulating on social media in China.Share prices in a select number of blockchain firms have soared, leading many of them to deny they are engaged in extensive digital currency-related activities using exceptionally similarly worded statements.Earlier this week, the CEO of crypto exchange OKEx, founded and run by Chinese entrepreneurs and once based in China, enthused about the DCEP’s potential knock-on benefits for the crypto industry, calling the token a “game-changer” for cryptocurrencies.But the most recent media reports have been dismissive of bitcoin, with one claiming that “speculators” hoping that the dawn of the DCEP will lead to a rise in the fortunes of bitcoin and major altcoins. The author of the Shanghai Observer article urged readers to bear in mind that the DCEP is not a cryptocurrency “like bitcoin, ETH and so on at all,” and to pay no heed to forecasts about possible DCEP-related bitcoin benefits.The author adds that blockchain technology is “only one” of the features of the DCEP, and points out that while bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are decentralized in nature, the DCEP is very much centralized, with the PBoC in control.And the same outlet adds that Bitcoin network speeds are too low for widespread use in the Chinese retail industry – while DCEP transaction rates are expected to be considerably faster.The author concludes that crypto has “no monetary attributes” and no fiscal worth, that tokens are “just virtual goods” and that while the DCEP will be pegged 1:1 to the fiat RMB, cryptocurrencies experience market volatility “on a daily basis.”"

","Publicly traded crypto mining company Riot Blockchain, Inc. says it has purchased 1,000 next generation mining machines, as the Bitcoin (BTC) miners brace for the upcoming halving in mining rewards, expected to occur on May 12.","The company said it has recently completed a purchase of 1,000 units of the next generation Bitmain's S19 (110 TH) Pro Antminer machine, worth an estimated USD 2.4 million.Riot Blockchain, which exclusively mines BTC, bitcoin cash (BCH), and litecoin (LTC), further said that the new investment was paid for with cash on hand, and that it estimates the new machines will increase its aggregate operating hashrate, or computing power, by 46%, to about 358 petahash per second.The new mining machines are expected to be delivered by early July, Riot Blockchain said in its announcement. As such, the mining company will have to continue working without these more efficient machines for at least two months after the halving in mining rewards takes place.In 2019, the company invested in 4,000 Bitmain S17 Pro Antminers, which when deployed in early 2020 resulted in an increase in Riot's fully owned hashing power capacity to approximately 248 Petahash.Riot Blockchain operates a major mining farm in a leased facility in Oklahoma City in the US, and says it produced 944 newly minted BTC (USD 8.3 million) in 2019 and increased bitcoin inventory 206% year-over-year to BTC 514 BTC at December 31, 2019.The company recorded revenue from cryptocurrency mining of USD 6.74 million last year, down from 7.75 million in 2018. However, high operating costs still made the mining operations unprofitable, with a reported loss of approximately USD 20 million last year, or 67% smaller than in 2018, the company’s financial statement for 2019 revealed. Also, at December 31, 2019, the Riot Blockchain had USD 11.3 million in cash and cryptocurrencies, or 11 times more than a year earlier. Listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange under the ticker RIOT, the company’s stock has seen mixed performance this year, which has largely mirrored the bitcoin price. Like bitcoin, the stock saw steep declines in late February and early March, but has now recovered nearly all of its losses. RIOT price chart:__Learn more:

April 27, 2020
","The market sentiment looks improved today compared to seven days ago. Following a small drop to 5.2/10 last week, the combined moving average 7-day market sentiment measure, sentscore, for the top 10 coins surpassed its highest level in the past five weeks - that of 5.27 from two weeks ago - and now stands at 5.37, as crypto market sentiment analysis service Omenics shows.","The week brings good news for all but one coin - only Tether (USDT) is in red this Monday. Meanwhile, after several weeks, we have two coins in the positive zone, these being first two coins by market capitalization: Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH).  Five cryptos have sentscores above 5, three are above 4, and there are no coins in the negative zone. The 24-hour time frame looks even better. This Monday is showing five out of ten coins in the positive zone, with Bitcoin reaching 6.9. Four are in the 5-5.9 range, and only Tether has a score of 4.7, but it too has gone almost 6% up today. In total, the combined sentscore for these 10 coins today is even closer to the positive zone: 5.86. Sentiment change among the top 10 coins in the past week*:
Interpreting the sentscore’s scale:
- 0 to 2.5: very negative
- 2 to 3.9: somewhat negative zone
- 4 to 5.9: neutral zone
- 6 to 7.49: somewhat positive zone
- 7.5 to 10: very positiveThough the difference between them is small, three coins have seen green double-digit percentiles next to their names this week: Bitcoin Cash (BCH), EOS, and Stellar (XLM), respectively. BCH's highest score is in news (5.6). It got some lower scores in social and technicals (4.6 and 4.3), as well as negative scores in buzz and fundamentals (3.6 and 2.7). Similarly, EOS has a high score in news, with 6.4, as well as neutral scores of 5.4 in technicals and 4.6 in social, while its buzz and fundamental received 3.5 and 3.2, respectively. Stellar is a double winner today. Not only is it among the coins with the highest rise in sentscore this week, but that rise enabled it to push Chainlink (LINK) out of the top 10 list and take its place. It has two quite high scores of 7.1 and 7 in technicals and news, as well as a neutral 5.4 in social. Its buzz and fundamentals have negative scores though: 3.9 and 3.6. Daily Bitcoin sentscore change in the past month:The one coin that saw a percentile in red next to its name is today's losing coin. Tether's strongest point is news, which has a positive score of 6.3. It's followed by 5.5 in buzz, as well as 4.7 in technicals and 4.3 in social. Its weakest point this week is fundamentals, which got a negative score of 3.8. Lastly, taking a look at the rest of Omenic's list besides the top ten coins over the course of the past seven days, we find an improved situation here as well. Compared to most of them last week, only 10 saw their sentscores drop this time around. Ten - one less than last week - have scores above 5, and one is even in the positive zone with a sentscore of 6: Nano (NANO). Two are in the negative zone, Komodo (KMD) and Steem (STEEM), and the rest are in the 4-4.9 range. ___* - Methodology:Omenics measures the market sentiment by calculating the sentscore, which aggregates the sentiment from news, social media, technical analysis, viral trends, and coin fundamentals-based upon their proprietary algorithms.
As their website explains, “Omenics aggregates trending news articles and viral social media posts into an all-in-one data platform, where you can also analyze content sentiment,” later adding, “Omenics combines the 2 sentiment indicators from news and social media with 3 additional verticals for technical analysis, coin fundamentals, and buzz, resulting in the sentscore which reports a general outlook for each coin.” For now, they are rating 39 cryptocurrencies."

April 30, 2020
","While Ethereum (ETH) supporters are celebrating claims that ""ETH is used 440x more than Bitcoin for transacting"" and this proves that ether is money, other crypto industry players warn that it's not so simple. ","Adam Cochran, Partner at decentralized autonomous organization Metacartel Ventures, made waves in the Cryptoverse yesterday with his research of 10,000 Ethereum addresses and 32 findings he made. The ""ETH is money"" part was the most liked and shared on Twitter. Cochran found that ETH 16.2 million is in 'active' circulation. He told Cryptonews.com that he identified addresses of payment processors/gateways (e.g. CoinPayments, Coinbase Commerce, etc.), as well as smart contracts - if an address interacted with any of these identified within 30 days, it was listed as actively in circulation. Within 90 days, that number is ETH 26 million, he said. These numbers mean that ""ETH is actually being *HEAVILY* used as money and gas,"" Cochran wrote in his report. He went on to compare ETH to bitcoin (BTC), claiming that 57% of BTC hasn’t moved in over a year, with 21% not moving since 2015, while only 0.36% of BTC has been through a payment processor in the last two years. ""When it comes to being money, ETH is used 440x more than bitcoin for transacting,"" he said, stressing that ""ETH is money. Plain, simple, and re-tweetable.""However, Rafael Schultze-Kraft, Co-founder and Chief Technology Officer at crypto market researcher Glassnode, responded that this is ""not that plain and simple, unfortunately."" He argued that if one compares transactions that actually transfer ether - that is, exclude those with ETH 0 that are related to smart contract calls and large chains of internal transactions not initiated by Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) - then ""Ethereum and Bitcoin are actually very comparable."" ""It's more like 59% of BTC that hasn't moved in over year, but the number for ETH is comparable,"" he told Cryptonews.com.Meanwhile, CEO of crypto research firm Arcane Research, Torbjørn Bull Jenssen, said that ""whether ether is money or not depends on the definition you are using and the context you are in"" and ""the same goes for bitcoin."" He explained that both of these tokens are transferable digital objects with purchasing power - they are their own unit of account and could be defined as money, he said.However, Jenssen also questions the validity of the metric used in this context. Looking at on-chain metrics for these two top coins, ""it is clear that bitcoin is much larger and transfers way more value than ether,"" the CEO told Cryptonews.com. ""A small share of the coins, shifting hands often, can have a large economic impact."" Therefore, he argued, the share of bitcoins that hasn't moved since a certain point in time is ""a bad metric for assessing the use of bitcoin as a medium of exchange or payment rail."" Instead, he suggested looking at the (absolute) flow of value. ""It is also important to note that saving in bitcoin, and other cryptocurrencies, holding over time, is a form of monetary use,"" he concluded.Meanwhile, Chief Marketing Officer of major crypto payments provider BitPay, Bill Zielke, said that BitPay today processes ""significantly more payments in bitcoin"" than ETH. He did not provide specific numbers.However, no matter which coin is being used more as money, some industry players believe that both networks need each other.""ETH is definitely money,"" said trader and market analyst known as Bitcoin Jack. ""It complements BTC and the two blockchains require each other more than ever."" He added that, compared to most blockchains, Ethereum is fairly decentralized, though perhaps less so than Bitcoin, ""but it serves an infrastructure purpose to bridge legacy finance to digital finance."" Furthermore, Ethereum is faster than Bitcoin and less secure, but it's currently facilitating fiat digitalization and aiding adoption around crypto, argued the trader. As for what may await in the future, Bitcoin Jack believes that with the upcoming Ethereum 2.0 we will see inflation for ETH drop further and to similar levels as Bitcoin, ""whilst encouraging locking up supply in staking nodes, effectively reducing available circulating in an artificial way."" Meanwhile, for now, BTC will remain the most secure blockchain around, ""but ETH is likely to become the backbone that facilitates finance on a larger and faster scale.""

April 25, 2020
","Facebook’s Libra has changed. Having been roundly criticized after its unveiling in June 2019, it has now updated its white paper in a bid to placate regulators and governments.","Most notably, the new look Libra gets rid of any intention to move to a permissionless ledger. It also introduces a range of stablecoins pegged to single national fiat currencies, in addition to the multi-pegged Libra stablecoin itself.But while this will likely soften the stance of regulators, how will it affect cryptoassets and the wider blockchain industry? Well, the picture here is mixed, because even though Libra might help crypto adoption, initially, it still might be a major competitor too decentralized cryptoassets such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) and might also harden the stance of governments towards these assets.Unveiled last June, Facebook originally intended Libra to be backed by a mix of currencies and also government debt. However, regulators and central banks quickly became concerned that it could destabilize monetary policy, as well as enable money laundering and threaten user privacy.As such, its newly updated white paper makes a number of concessions to regulators. Firstly, it takes pains to emphasize that it will comply with all applicable AML (anti-money laundering) and KYC (know your customer) regulations. It also moves from a multi-pegged single stablecoin to lots of single-peg stablecoins.“The Libra coin will be a basket (i.e., an asset allocation container) of underlying central bank digital currencies represented on the network. This means that there will be a digital dollar, a digital euro, and a digital sterling all traveling on the Libra blockchain rails. This is analogous to today's stablecoins traveling on the Ethereum rails,” explains ConsenSys’ global fintech co-head Lex Sokolin.For him, the fact that Libra will bring in fiat-backed stablecoins means it won’t be a direct competitor to the likes of BTC or ETH that represent the value of the underlying networks, and are considered digital commodities.However, for other industry figures, Libra’s stablecoins may compete with cryptoassets insofar as the general public may be more willing to trust a ‘reliable’ company like Facebook than a decentralized network.“Levels of public trust in decentralized cryptocurrencies are still quite low,” explains Glen Goodman, the author of The Crypto Trader. ""The crypto boom & bust a couple of years ago has clearly left scars. New research from The Economist Intelligence Unit suggests people are more likely to trust a service like Libra set up by a giant tech firm than a decentralized crypto like Bitcoin.”Still, while there’s a risk that Libra might steal adoption from Bitcoin, Interactive Investor’s Gary McFarlane thinks that Libra’s restricted nature may actually end up sending people towards genuinely decentralized cryptocurrencies.He tells Cryptonews.com, “Libra, seen as a sort of roundabout diversion to a decentralized destination that others will arrive at in a different time, will enhance the currently existing value differential of truly global, frictionless (fees and transaction speeds aside), censorship-resistant cryptocurrencies.”“In other words, Bitcoin will be a beneficiary, and more broadly Libra may lift all crypto boats,” McFarlane concludes.The new Libra also drops all plans to move to a permissionless, open system, instead opting to remain a private, permissioned database. Nonetheless, Glen Goodman believes it will encourage the emergence of a whole ecosystem of digital money services, some of which may involve actual blockchains and cryptoassets.“Libra has a lot of drawbacks, but crucially it will still be a digital platform that other services can be built upon,” he says. “Smart contracts will allow people to make business agreements with defined rules, executed directly by the Libra network.”Lex Sokolin agrees that Libra will allow for additional services to be integrated with or built on top of it. Although he suggests that there still might be a few teething problems before it can fully get off the ground.“Developers will need to test and scale the tech, run the hackathons, and volunteer the building hours to create an ecosystem of products and services on top of the network,” he says. “Libra made its codebase open-source when it launched in June of 2019, but it will take more than that to stress-test the system and reap the benefits of a dedicated community.”Sokolin also notes that Libra’s technical implementation borrows a lot of ideas from Ethereum and other public blockchains, so there’s a possibility that some kind of interoperability could emerge down the line. Which would obviously be great for driving the general public towards blockchains and crypto.Also, Binance Research, the research arm of the major crypto exchange Binance that has its own interests in the stablecoins business, said recently that if ""≋LBR [Libra] were to become widely used with products directly quoted in ≋LBR, we could imagine new stablecoins, both fiat-backed (e.g., collateralized stablecoin) and crypto-backed (e.g., Maker), replicating its peg on multiple permissionless networks like Ethereum.""Is there a risk that Libra’s capitulation to regulators will make said regulators (and governments) take a harder line on cryptoassets and public blockchains? Glen Goodman seems to think so.“There is now a danger that national authorities will feel it's more acceptable to clamp down on the independent cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin if there is an 'official' alternative like Libra.”However, Lex Sokolin believes that governments were already taking a harder line, regardless of Libra. He says, “The government crafts regulation complementary to the technology, not the other way around, which is what Libra is facing.”All of which might mean that Libra won’t have much of a negative impact. And even if it isn’t really a cryptocurrency or a blockchain, it may ultimately boost wider blockchain development and turn more people onto decentralized cryptocurrencies."

",A Dutch Bitcoin (BTC) exchange has become one of the first casualties of a new regulatory procedure that requires many of the nation’s crypto-related companies to register with the central bank or close down.,"The central bank, the De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB), has set a May 18 deadline for registration after the nation’s parliament voted in favor of adopting the EU’s anti-money laundering guidelines, as outlined by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).The long-running exchange, BitKassa, says that it will shut down on May 17, a day before the registration deadline. It also issued a scathing statement, decrying the government’s decision to impose “approximately USD 27,000 ([USD 5,400] registration fee plus almost [USD 21,600] in basic costs)” fees on all companies in 2020, “regardless of size.”The FATF has stated that government financial regulators should enforce a compulsory registration system, not unlike that used in Japan, where over two dozen exchanges have registered with the regulator.However, BitKassa stated that per its calculations,“Dutch [crypto] companies will have to pay [USD 1.8 million] in total, for less than 8 months of regulation in 2020 alone. On average this is more than trusts or credit card companies are paying. This is [a killer] for startups.”The exchange pointed out that, in an official post, the DNB had conceded that it would be “optimistic” to expect that all 75 of the nation’s crypto trading and custody companies would be able to afford the fees and costs.“We have no confidence at all that these annual costs will be less next year,” wrote the exchange.And the trading platform signed off with another barb aimed at the DNB, writing,“[In the future,] we are very likely still to be involved with Bitcoin in one way or another. But that'll be with projects not subject to central bank regulation.”The new regulations pertain to companies that conduct crypto-to-fiat transactions (and vice versa), and those that provide cryptoasset custodial services, although companies that exclusively engage in cryptocurrency-to-cryptocurrency business are exempt.Twitter users expressed their outrage, with one dismissing the DNB’s regulation fees as “ridiculous,” and accusing the central bank of “murdering” fintech innovation.Another legendary Dutch Bitcoin company is forced to shut down due to ridiculous ""registration fees"" by the Dutch C… https://t.co/CAq76HlF0JMeanwhile, in April, the DNB admitted that (unspecified) parts of Bitcoin’s underlying technology could be used in creating a new type of currency."

",Canada-based major blockchain technology firm Blockstream has launched a new version of their satellite network that broadcasts the Bitcoin (BTC) blockchain around the world and announced satellite kits.,"Blockstream Satellite 2.0 moved from a custom protocol to a new one (DVB-S2), which is meant to improve signal reliability and spectral efficiency, as well as deliver higher bitrates, the company said yesterday. It's also compatible with the equipment, hence not requiring a dedicated computer for decoding. Additionally, Blockstream said tat this update increases data capacity by more than 13 times, from c. 120 kbps to c. 1.6 Mbps, while spectrum bandwidth is increased 4 times, from 300 kHz to 1.2 MHz. These improvements allowed the maximum file size for user-broadcasted application program interface (API) transmissions to be increased as well, from 10 KB to 1 MB. Additional updated features, namely forward error correction (FEC) and lossless Bitcoin transaction compression, enabled the company ""to reduce the volume of transmitted data by over 50% as compared to the uncompressed Bitcoin transaction data sent with the old forward error correction scheme."" the tech behind the > 25x capacity increase:- 4x spectrum bandwidth (300kHz to 1.2MHz)- 3.3x spectral efficiency (DVB-S2 protocol)- 1.8x from lower overhead FEC (45% lower overhead)- 1.2x from lossless compression (Arivd Norberg & @pwuille)total 28xhttps://t.co/LqTiCam7LSThe network allows users to connect a Bitcoin full node and download the entirety of the Bitcoin blockchain, from the original genesis block in 2009 until today, without needing to connect to the internet. It also brings more coverage for the Asia-Pacific region.This development follows the 1.0 network launch in August 2017, as well as the update which expanded network coverage to the Asia-Pacific region (in addition to South America, Europe, and Africa), and the launch of the Blockstream Satellite API Beta (Lightning-powered message API). The 1.0 network will be disabled on June 1, leaving the hardware still compatible with the 2.0 network, but requiring a software update and switching to the new 2.0 service.Furthermore, the company has announced that satellite kits will soon be available for pre-order at the Blockstream Store, which will include two consumer-rate receiver kits ready to connect a Bitcoin node at home, and an optional antenna kit. This basic kit's pre-sale price is USD 279, and there's a pro kit for USD 749.____Learn more:

April 22, 2020
","The move from fiat currencies to new central bank digital currencies appears to be gaining traction, as one of Europe’s biggest central banks admitted that (unspecified) parts of Bitcoin’s underlying technology could be used in creating a new type of currency.","The paper, which was written by the Dutch National Bank (DNB) and titled Digital Central Bank Money: Objectives, Preconditions, and Design Choices, explores how a “future proof” digital currency in the Eurozone could look like. Among other things, the paper discusses ways that a currency based on “a smart contract system” may lower transaction costs, and thus potentially increase the demand for the government-issued currency. The central bank noted that “specific technologies previously pioneered for some cryptos” could be of use for a future CBDC in order to achieve these goals. However, the bank did not specify what it liked about the “pioneers.”In the paper, the DNB compares the most popular cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC), with Facebook's Libra, which was revamped recently, admitting that BTC is a more decentralized currency than Libra or a CBCDC. However, the central bank made it clear that it does not see the decentralized nature of cryptocurrency as part of the solution for a future CBDC. Instead, the DBN, worried about losing control in case of a decentralized CBDC, wrote that it considers the decentralization seen in the crypto space as “partly ideologically driven,” while calling Bitcoin’s consensus model “unnecessary” for a CBDC given its “excessive electricity consumption.”Further, in what appeared as a half-hearted admission of the inefficiencies of today’s fiat currencies, the report noted that in order for any new type of currency to work, “it will need to be attuned to the needs of its users, whose payments are increasingly digital.” It also said that a CBDC could “help foster trust in the monetary system,” during uncertain times, although it admitted that it may also “exacerbate the risk of a bank run.”Finally, the Dutch Central Bank said that it sees the Netherlands as a suitable place to experiment with new CBDCs, given that the population there is already highly accustomed to making electronic payments.“The Netherlands provides a suitable testing ground for such an experiment,” and is “ready to play a leading role,” the central bank concluded its report by saying.As reported, the “central bank of central banks” and multiple analysts think that the fear of the coronavirus transmission via cash and banking cards may shorten the road to CBDCs. Also, other analysts argue that CBDC might help recover from a recession. Meanwhile, a study by another central bank in the Eurozone in December last year concluded that: ""Single-jurisdictional level initiatives are not capable of meeting a global citizens’ need for a safe, trustworthy, and cost-efficient instrument for cross-border payments."" However, ""modern-day technology seems to be able to address this need. […] The issue, including the idea of multicurrency CBDC deserves deep joint analysis."""

",A Bitcoin (BTC) aficionado has pulled off a famous cryptocurrency-related e-sports first – by beating a pro-NASCAR driver in a racing game.,"Bryan Cook, who goes by the name of Boris on Twitter, won his virtual NASCAR race in a car emblazoned with Bitcoin logos, beating pro driver Kyle Busch, the reigning NASCAR Cup Series champion – in front of an online audience of 50,000 viewers.Cook’s accomplishment was made on the iRacing platform, a virtual racing simulator whose operators say it can accommodate over 140,000 gamers (also known as sim racers) across the world.With the coronavirus pandemic putting the brakes on real-life racing, pro drivers such as Busch, as well as fellow NASCAR stars Dale Earnhardt Jr. and Denny Hamlin, took part in the contest. The real-life pro racers have been trying their hands at gaming in a bid to keep the sport going while North America continues to lockdown.Cook wrote, in a Reddit post,“I won in the virtual Bitcoin race car tonight and beat the real Dale Earnhardt Jr, Kyle Busch, and other pro drivers in front of 50,000+ live viewers.” In addition to his gaming and crypto intrestest, Cook works full-time as the chief digital officer (CDO) of Joe Gibbs Racing, a NASCAR race team based in North Carolina that is owned by former NFL coach Joe Jackson Gibbs.Cook also celebrated his win on Twitter.I fell in love with #NASCAR thru the original Papyrus NASCAR Racing game/sim.Adam Stern, a motorsports/e-sports reporter at Sports Business Journal, tweeted that the world of crypto was “thrilled with Joe Gibbs Racing digital exec [Bryan Cook] … after he won an iRacing event with a Bitcoin paint scheme.” Echoing Stern’s observation, a Reddit user replied to Cook’s post, stating that the CEO was “one of the stars aligning for Bitcoin mass adoption”.Cook replied he was just “thankful to be given a spot in the field.”Cook wrote,“I’ve been sim racing for 25+ years, since I was 12-13. Along the way, I’ve raced with people who are now professionals in the racing industry. I have also made a career out of the racing industry. So when coronavirus hit, the sim racing community looked to organize these races to help fans have some escape and entertainment.”"

","Institutional investors are far from homogenous and while some have already invested in cryptoassets others may never do this, Nick Prince, Financial Strategy Analyst at major crypto exchange Coinbase, said. Family offices are the most likely to invest in crypto, and banks/insurance companies the least, he added.","In his recent blog post, Prince listed types of institutional investors in order of likelihood to invest in crypto, from most to least likely. The analyst said that the post was written while he still worked at the Santa Barbara County Pension Fund in the US last fall and doesn't ""incorporate any new information since I joined Coinbase."" Family offices are responsible for managing the wealth of individuals or families and, among the investment teams mentioned here, these get the least amount of public oversight. These investors are awarded an accredited or qualified classification due to their wealth, and this enables them to invest in private markets that regulators don't allow retail to enter. ""With both the willingness and ability to invest in crypto,"" wrote Prince, ""this group is a logical early entrant into crypto investing.""

Major Investment Force Awakens As Financial Advisors Warm Up To Bitcoin
Launching Bitcoin ETFs Could Burst the Bitcoin Floodgates – StudyEndowments and foundations manage funds for organizations like universities and charities, and as such, they differ from banks or insurance companies in several vital points. Their investment programs are allowed more risk, portfolio managers have more freedom in what they can invest in, and funds can afford enough time to wait out the market fluctuations, while holding onto an investment longer, thus earning an illiquidity premium. These characteristics enabled investors to move into alternative assets ""(realizing incredible returns over time)"" and ""have also enabled them to be early movers into digital assets, as evidenced by Yale, Harvard and other notable endowments all making allocations to crypto funds."" This ""mythical unicorn of institutional investors"" and ""the proverbial pot at the end of the rainbow for HODLers"" is a very diverse group. It may be a private corporation or a public entity of various sizes. ""It is reasonable to expect pension funds to invest meaningfully into this asset class"" before banks, insurance companies, and sovereign wealth funds, says Prince, but after family offices and endowments. Also, Prince argues that today exist compliant ways for a pension fund to invest in crypto. Furthermore, to the Cryptoverse these investors seem to be barely moving if at all, he says, but time and speed are relative. While the Cryptoverse is used to fast pace, to pension funds, theirs is likely just the normal speed of progress. ""Appreciate this reality and continue to build, disrupt, and educate. Pensions will come, as they always do,"" said Prince.

He wrote that there is over USD 7 trillion, on the aggregate, of permanent capital ""looking for a home,"" and expects that crypto will eventually become a home to this money. But at this point in time, the ""market is still too small for these behemoths to meaningfully deploy capital.""
Meanwhile, in April, Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund said they're ""looking into any opportunity."" However, a report by Bloomberg did not mention cryptoassets. The fund did not respond to our request for comment.""Don’t hold your breath on banks/insurance companies putting bitcoin in their portfolios."" wrote Prince. They use the liability driven investing (LDI) strategy  - they have liabilities on their balance sheets (e.g. customer deposits or insurance policies), which are legal obligations, and their goal is to keep the value of the assets paired with liabilities. ""Since the value of bank deposits and insurance claims are not likely to move in lockstep with that of Bitcoin, not only would these institutions not be interested in investing, they actually have strict investment policy constraints that forbid investment in something like bitcoin,"" concluded Prince. 
__Meanwhile, as previously reported, experts seem to agree with the idea that Bitcoin should spend less time proving itself. Crypto will tip and go mainstream once we build a product that people both want and can use, Lou Kerner, Partner at crypto advisory firm CryptoOracle, told Cryptonews.com right after “Black Thursday” when large professional and institutional traders accounted for the lion’s share of sellers. He added that this financial revolution is being led by people and organizations that do not ask permission. It's not being led by institutions. ""Institutions will follow. Build great products. Everything will follow,"" he said.I don’t think the conversation even started for most funds until the custody space grew up.

As reported a week ago, Purse said that it would close its doors six years after its launch, disabling new signups right away, while keeping its ongoing orders and withdrawals supported until June 26. As soon as it was published, a number of people, including well-known traders and developers within the crypto community, expressed their disappointment that the company has come to that point.

BTC mining difficulty went up again and may even reach a new all-time high before the halving. Meanwhile, researchers were hard at work, saying that the crypto market is “returning to rational” levels, stablecoins don't inflate crypto markets, and new Libra could help crypto adoption, while some analysts were painting a bullish picture for bitcoin, with lower bond yields and a weak stock market.","We also saw Ripple sue YouTube for allegedly failing to fight scams, and K-pop and charity kingpin denied crypto scam reports.

","The crypto market sentiment has made another, relatively large step upwards over the course of the past week. The combined moving average 7-day market sentiment measure, sentscore, for the top 10 coins continued its rise from seven days ago, climbing from 5.37 at the time to today's 5.88 - that way being just 0.12 away from the positive zone, as shown by crypto market sentiment analysis service Omenics.","The market's good weekly fortune continues, as all coins - including the last week's lonely, red wolf Tether (USDT) - are green today. Furthermore, following two coins' entrance into the positive zone, now the market has three coins with or above the score of 6: Bitcoin (BTC), whose sentscore has climbed from 6.2 to 7/10 in a week, and Ethereum (ETH), whose score saw a rise from 6.1 to 6.5, are joined by a last week's winner, Stellar (XLM), which also had a score increase from 5.7 to 6. The rest of the coins have scores above 5, and only one compared to last week's three, Tether, has a score below 5, but it too is sitting on the verge of it.Now looking at the daily scores, instead on the last seven days - we see mixed results. While four coins are seeing their sentscores increase, six have dropped. Nonetheless, like last Monday, five out of the ten coins are in the positive zone. Also, the combined sentscore for these 10 coins over the course of the last 24 hours is 5.95, compared to last Monday's 5.86.Sentiment change among the top 10 coins in the past week*:
Interpreting the sentscore’s scale:
- 0 to 2.5: very negative
- 2 to 3.9: somewhat negative zone
- 4 to 5.9: neutral zone
- 6 to 7.49: somewhat positive zone
- 7.5 to 10: very positiveGoing back to the weekly views in search for winners and losers, we find Bitcoin (BCH) at the absolute top, having a rise in its sentscore of nearly 28%. The second-placed XRP's score is up by 15.5%, and it's closely followed by Bitcoin's 15%. We can also note that Litecoin (LTC) and EOS are not far behind and also boast double-digit jumps. BCH's highest scores this week are 7.4 in news and 6.1 in technicals, as well as 5.7 in social. However, its lowest are 3.7 in buzz and 2.6 in fundamentals. Similarly, XRP has high scores in news, technicals, and social (6.8, 6.7, and 5.6, respectively), while it got lower scores in fundamentals and buzz, though only the latter is negative (4.5 and 3.7, respectively). Lastly, Bitcoin is an oft-discussed coin but one that rarely makes the winner or the loser list with its sentscore rise/drop percentage. This time we get to look under its 'hood' too, finding it has three quite high scores: 8.8 in fundamentals, 7.3 in news, and 7.1 in technicals. It also has the neutral sentscore of 5.1 in social, as well as the negative score of 3.6 in buzz. Daily Bitcoin sentscore change in the past month:On the other side, we find no losers per se, so we'll look into those whose scores went up the least, between 1% and 2%, these being Tether and Tezos (XTZ). Much like last week, Tether's strongest aspect this week is news (7.6), followed by buzz (5.4), technicals (4.5), and social (4.1), while its weakest aspect is fundamentals (3.6). Meanwhile, Tezos has two positive scores, 7.6 and 7.1, in technicals and news, respectively. It also has two neutral scores - 5.4 in buzz and 5.2 in social, and a negative score 2.9 in fundamentals.Finally, let's take a look at the week's scores of the 29 coins that stand outside the top 10 list and which are also tracked by Omenics. Unlike last week's ten coins whose scores dropped, now there are only three. Furthermore, two are in the positive zone - Cardano (ADA) with 6.1 and Nano (NANO) with 6.4, the latter of which is up from last week's 6.  Twenty-two, compared to last week's ten, have scores above 5, four have scores above 4, and only one - Komodo (KMD) - remains in the negative zone.___* - Methodology:Omenics measures the market sentiment by calculating the sentscore, which aggregates the sentiment from news, social media, technical analysis, viral trends, and coin fundamentals-based upon their proprietary algorithms.
As their website explains, “Omenics aggregates trending news articles and viral social media posts into an all-in-one data platform, where you can also analyze content sentiment,” later adding, “Omenics combines the 2 sentiment indicators from news and social media with 3 additional verticals for technical analysis, coin fundamentals, and buzz, resulting in the sentscore which reports a general outlook for each coin.” For now, they are rating 39 cryptocurrencies."

","Following a downturn in trading volumes after the coronavirus-triggered market panic in March liquidated a massive amount of trades on crypto derivatives platform BitMEX, the exchange is again looking to capture market share by offering a new product for their risk-loving clients.","The new trading product is rather unique in the crypto market as it allows traders to speculate on the ethereum (ETH) price in US dollars without ever touching neither ETH nor USD. Instead, the new ETH/USD contract, called a “quanto futures contract” has “a fixed bitcoin multiplier” that makes it possible to make or lose bitcoin (BTC) based on changes in the ETH/USD exchange rate.The new product combines the “quanto” feature of their regular ETHUSD perpetual swap contract with expiry and settlement known from futures trading in the traditional financial markets, and expires quarterly, the exchange said. Unlike in the traditional futures market, the perpetual futures contracts normally offered on BitMEX are contracts that do not expire, but instead mimics a type of leveraged spot market. The new product launch comes at a challenging time for BitMEX, which has been accused of everything from offering excessive leverage to retail traders, to exacerbate the bitcoin crash on “Black Thursday”, and for having an unusually large influence on price discovery in the bitcoin market.Some traders have also chosen to abandon the platform, with both trading volumes and open interest in bitcoin futures on BitMEX declining markedly after crypto’s “black Thursday” on March 12. Although it is not entirely clear why that has happened, Coin Metrics speculates that it is either because:Based on the report’s findings, however, the reality appears to be a combination of the two, with evidence showing both that other exchanges such as Binance have taken market share from BitMEX, and that the overall size of the bitcoin futures market has been reduced to a lower level.__According to the announcement made by BitMEX, the new product is already available on the BitMEX Testnet – the platform’s demo environment where users can get used to the real platform and hone their trading skills without putting real money on the line.

","Ukraine’s plan to offset the financial chaos of the coronavirus pandemic might involve nuclear-powered cryptocurrency mining, says its energy ministry.","Yesterday, the country’s Ministry of Energy and Environmental Protection announced that it wanted the country’s four nuclear power plants to look into ways to “integrate crypto mining initiatives.”The ministry said it was working on the initiative with Energoatom, the state agency that manages the nation’s four nuclear power plants. The nuclear power plants have a combined 15 reactors that provide 13.9 GWe of electricity, the seventh-highest nuclear power generation rate in the world.The ministry stated that “implementing cryptocurrency mining projects” could “provide additional markets for atomic electricity,” would “boost the reliability and efficiency of Ukrainian nuclear power plants” and address surplus energy-related matters.However, in a Facebook post made in the early hours of May 6, the ministry went on to clarify that one nuclear power plant will initiate the “first phase” of the pilot with a “data center”  near its Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Station – the biggest nuclear plant in Europe.The ministry says that its pilot, conducted with Energoatom, could eventually “connect consumers of [data centers] with a capacity of up to 1000MW,” while the initial Zaporizhia project will see 30MW provided to mining initiatives.A spokesperson of the ministry told Cryptonews.com that this is only a suggestion. We'll update the article should the ministry provide more details about the project.  Meanwhile, in the post, the ministry stated that the initiative was part of a move away from “Soviet” economic models, and wrote,“One modern way to use excess electricity is to direct it into cryptocurrencies. This not only allows you to maintain a guaranteed load for nuclear power plants, but it also gives enterprises the opportunity to raise additional funds.”The ministry says that the stimulus measures will initially involve government support, but eventually aims to ensure that nuclear power-reliant ""data centers"" become self-sufficient."

","The coins have entered a new month of this year, meaning it's time we take a look at how they fared in the previous month - and there's something to see! April's so green, we couldn't even find a proper loser. While major coins saw double-digit rises last month, there are only two coins that saw drops in the 100 coins by market capitalization category and only twelve in the 200 category. Overall, it's been a very good month for crypto.","Following a rather bloody March, the relatively slow crypto market of April saw a jump near the month's very end. Thanks to this, bitcoin (BTC) recovered all of its losses suffered in crypto’s “Black Thursday,” which brought it down almost 50%. Furthermore, several other major cryptoassets, including ethereum (ETH) and bitcoin cash (BCH), also experienced a strong performance. These price rises have led to this very green picture we see today.That said, analysts at major crypto exchange Kraken warned a month ago that, while April was historically the second-best performing month for BTC, investors should look out for the possible miner and/or hodler capitulation, but also look at how the world is dealing with the coronavirus-triggered economic crisis. The players leaving the game might decide to liquidate any bitcoin and other assets they hold.All coins within the ten by market capitalization category have seen a significant rise in their respective prices over the course of the last month, and all double-digit - not taking tether (USDT) into account, as it's a stablecoin. Among these, we find tezos (XTZ) at the very top with a c. 77% rise in April. It's followed by ETH, as well as binance coin (BNB), the prices of which have gone up 59% and 42%, respectively.The number one coin by market capitalization takes the fourth place on this list for April, seeing its price appreciate 37%. The rest of the top 10 coins enjoyed a rise between 21% and 29%, except for BCH, which appreciated 16% - the least on the list.Speaking of BCH, it's worth noting that it and Bitcoin SV (BSV) both went through their first halving events in April. Meanwhile, BTC's halving is expected to happen on May 12.Zooming out a bit to look at the first 50 coins by market capitalization in search for our winners, we no longer struggle to find them. Unlike March that had a single green coin in the sea of red, April offers an abundance of greenery. At the very top in this category stands digibyte (DGB) with a rise of 240%. Most of the other coins on this list appreciated between 59% and 77%, and the three to rise the least are in the 40th percentile, with cosmos (ATOM) taking the last spot.Meanwhile, hive token (HIVE) is in the second place, having appreciated almost 117%. This is a significant step for the new coin, as its rise follows a tumultuous period in Steem (STEEM)'s existence that led to the creation of Hive. The loser list is tricky this time around. Not taking into account stablecoins, we are still left with only green coins in the top 50. This means that we're looking into those who appreciated the least in April. Several coins with a rise of over 20% meet this criteria, among which we find two from the top 10 coins as well: litecoin (LTC) and XRP (XRP). These are followed by three coins with a rise over 10%, and lastly, the coin that appreciated only 2% in over the month of April - leo token (LEO). Now, let's look at the top 100 by market capitalization category, according to market data provider Coincodex. There's one coin here that leaves all the others in the dust by far: bloomzed Token (BZT), with a whopping rise of 1,799%. The next three on the list still boast high, three-digit percentages, with hyperion (HYN) leading the pack (350%). DGB comes next, followed by aave (LEND) with 125% and then Hive. The rest of the top 10 coins among the 100 appreciated between 79% and 83%. This includes stellar (XLM) with 79%. Here we do find some red coins, though still only two, which speaks volumes of the markets' recent recovery. sologenic (SOLO) dropped 100% in April, while playfuel (PLF) dropped 3%. Lastly, observing the top 200 coins by market capitalization, we see that BZT and HYN still occupy the first and the second spots, respectively. The lineup changes somewhat after that, with band protocol (BAND) ranking third (303%) and CGCX (CGCX) the forth (264%). Hive is in the 9th place and maid safe coin (MAID) takes the 10th with a 95% rise. On the other side, we find a total of twelve coins whose prices dropped in April. SOLO is at the top, now followed by gaps (GAP) which dropped 36% and yap stone (YAP) with -34%. The next three coins have dropped between 11% and 14%, and these precede five coins with 1%-3% drops."

","Ripple, the US-based fintech company affiliated with XRP, is facing yet another lawsuit after being accused of misleading investors by conducting an “unregistered offer and sale of securities.” However, the XRP market appears to have largely dismissed the news as noise.","As news started to circulate late Monday (UTC time),  the XRP market did not show any immediate reaction to the news, and instead continued trading higher over the next few hours. The token did, however, lag slightly behind both bitcoin (BTC) and ethereum (ETH) overnight, on what has been a strong day for the broader crypto market.As of press time (09:01 UTC), XRP was unchanged in the past 24 hours to a price of USD 0.219. That compares to a rise of 0.7% for BTC and 0.8% for ETH over the same time period.The lawsuit against Ripple was filed last Friday by a company called Bitcoin Manipulation Abatement LLC, and claimed that Ripple has made “a litany of false and misleading statements” about XRP, which were “designed to drive demand” for the token so that Ripple could “obtain greater returns on their XRP sales,” Law360 reported.In the lawsuit, which was filed with a district court in California, the plaintiff pointed out that XRP, in their opinion, is a security because those who bought it were told it would “increase in value,” while also being referred to as “investors” by Ripple. The plaintiff also noted that XRP cannot be considered a currency because “there are no products or services that can be purchased with XRP.” However, XRP can be used to purchase services and products.  Typical of a security, there is also “an expectation on the part of investors that they will profit if Ripple builds out the functionalities and alliances that it has promised,” the plaintiff wrote.Ripple, on its end, has also faced other lawsuits in the past claiming that XRP is an unregistered security, something Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has repeatedly denied.Also, in March this year, XRP investors accused Garlinghouse of touting the product, as well as suggesting that he was holding his XRP for the long-term while unloading XRP 67 million and liquidating the coins within days of getting themInterestingly, Bitcoin Manipulation Abatement LLC also filed a USD 150 million lawsuit last year against Binance-co-owned crypto derivatives exchange FTX, accusing it of market manipulation and other allegedly fraudulent behavior. Back then, however, the lawsuit got dismissed by the court after one month, while CEO of Binance, Changpeng Zhao, also largely dismissed the lawsuit as “very far fetched”.

April 21, 2020
",A Japanese analyst says that institutional investors are growing increasingly crypto-keen – and believes that the coronavirus pandemic will only serve to heighten their interest.,"Per Fisco, via Gentosha, popular Japanese blockchain and crypto author and analyst Tetsuyuki Oishi says that pre-coronavirus investment figures from brokers dealing in crypto funds show interest in crypto funds was growing fast among institutional investors in the months and weeks before the pandemic began to spread outside China.And while the outlook for most asset classes is now negative, to say the least, “total” pessimism need not be applied in the case of crypto.The analyst gave reasons for his hypothesis, stating that firstly, the pandemic is set to reduce demand at many companies, resulting in long-term declines in corporate profits. Most analysts believe that stock prices will struggle to pull off an unlikely V-shaped recovery. As such, investors will need to find ways to invest in assets other than stocks – as investors will be very reluctant to keep their holdings in fiat bank accounts and let them “sleep.”Secondly, he states that there is still only a limited amount of correlation between cryptoassets and conventional assets. In the early stages of the pandemic, all sorts of asset classes were sold off, including bitcoin (BTC). However, they have since picked up. With fiscal uncertainty on the rise in Japan and elsewhere as a result of the pandemic, investors will be on the lookout for asset classes that have little or no correlation with conventional assets.And finally, the analyst believes that the search for uncorrelated assets will naturally lead investors – no matter how crypto-skeptic they have been in the past – to pastures new, namely cryptocurrency and “especially bitcoin.”The claims give further credence to claims that investors are beginning to lose faith in traditional markets. Last week, economics experts told the Daily Telegraph that only “delusional markets are still betting on a V-shaped recovery” that “could not possibly happen.”Stock market investors, warned professor Anthony Costello of University College London, were living in “in cloud-cuckoo land” if they were anticipating a quick return to trading as usual."

April 23, 2020
","Contrary to popular belief, cryptocurrency prices may not be as dependent on the issuance of the most popular stablecoin, tether (USDT) as many people have thought, according to two researchers.","Stablecoins act more like a safe haven within the crypto ecosystem that investors seek refuge in during periods of strong volatility, Chief Innovation & Entrepreneurship Officer at UC Berkeley, Richard K. Lyons, and Assistant Finance Professor at Warwick Business School, Ganesh Viswanath-Natraj, argued in a recent commentary on VoxEU.org.As proof of this, the pair pointed to premiums seen on the exchange rates of stablecoins during sharp crypto market sell-off on March 12 and 13.  ""During the period of collapse in bitcoin markets in January and February of 2018, the price of tether traded up to USD 1.05, a premium of 500 basis points (5 cents) in the secondary market, and data on trading in the bitcoin-yether market suggests a significant rebalancing of portfolios away from bitcoin and towards tether during this period. We also find quantitatively similar premiums in Tether and other stable coins during the COVID-19 panic of March 2020,"" they said.However, the researchers added that they cannot rule out the possibility that price manipulation has occurred, only that the issuance of stablecoins has “no systematic effect” on cryptocurrency prices in the open market.“Rather, our evidence supports alternative views, namely, that stablecoin issuance endogenously responds to deviations of the secondary market rate from the pegged rate, and stablecoins consistently perform a safe-haven role in the digital economy,” the pair concluded by saying.They also pointed out that although the use of stablecoins has “risen dramatically in the last two years,” this is consistent with their “raison d’etre,” – their overall reason for existence – which is to act as a safe and US dollar-pegged store of value for crypto users.“Using our more precise measure of tether flow to the secondary market, we find no significant effect on prices of major non-stable crypto currencies. This result is robust to the choice of sample period – including the late 2017 period in which bitcoin prices surged – and holds for other major stable coins as well.”____Learn more:

April 30, 2020
",The text below is an advertorial article that was not written by Cryptonews.com journalists.,"Different approaches are applied when it comes to crypto betting and gambling in different countries. But the clearest stance on this is taken by Japan, and we know their history with cryptocurrency.Recently, a new set of regulations on crypto assets as it affects custodians and exchanges were passed by the house of representatives of Japan, and the regulations are named the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act and the Payment Services Act. Meanwhile, the crypto gambling sector of the country is still strictly regulated. As cryptocurrencies have become a staple of online transactions, we expect laws to become more lenient around crypto gambling, especially for gambling sites based on computer gaming, such as CSGO crash where cryptocurrency is one of the prime methods of transactions when playing games such as match betting and even roulette.Gambling in Japan is hugely regulated, and the same regulations apply to crypto gambling according to Joseph D. Hugh, who is the CEO of Jukebucks, an international platform for crypto betting. While talking to Cointelegraph, he went ahead to posit that the government capitalizes on taxation or hides under the cloak of taxation to monitor all crypto transactions that are coming from Japan, though they’ve not found a way to prevent players from playing on crypto casinos.But in 2018, Japan signed a legislation that legalized physical casinos at the federal level. After the Olympics of next year, the offline casino licenses from Japan would be made open to all major players according to Hugh. For him, nobody is sure of the firms that will be licensed to operate such casinos in Hokkaido, Osaka and Tokyo. But he is optimistic that after opening up the offline casinos for operators, they will open up online casinos too.The cryptocurrency sector has not really felt the impact of the integrated resort in Japan. Here, we are talking about a sort of do-it-all complex where theme parks, hotels, theaters, shopping malls, and casinos are located in one place. The reception of crypto gambling in Japan has not been a friendly one, even though their Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was the one that engineered the pro-casino law.Crypto Gambling In JapanMany people believed that crypto currency gambling would have been a household thing in Japan, because of the way the country implemented regulations on cryptocurrency before many others. But that is not the case, and this may be tied to the consequences arising from the fate of the Japanese crypto exchange, Mt. Gox, that got liquidated in 2014.In the first quarter of 2019, Tron, a blockchain network that has been telling people that they are developing an infrastructure that will house a decentralized internet halted gambling apps that ran on its decentralized app store in the country due to threats from the regulators.
The company’s co-founder and Chief Technology Officer (CTO), Lucien Chen, left the firm after they blocked access to some of their dapps to forestall problems. For him, these actions are against Tron’s claim to decentralization, but instead, portray them as a centralized firm.How Does Cryptocurrency Gambling WorkThere are two ways that blockchain gambling functions. They are the off-chain and the on-chain methods.When we talk about off-chain cryptocurrency gambling, what we are referring to are the land based or physical casinos where cryptocurrency payments are accepted. Most of these casinos normally accept Bitcoin as a deposit method.In most cases, they work with third party custodians like BitPay to exchange their Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency to fiat money. For online casinos, some of them have no fiat money payment methods. Players can also cash out in Bitcoin.For on-chain gambling, players have to use smart contracts through decentralized apps or dapps that have a backend code that runs on a blockchain network and not on the centralized conventional servers.Clamping down on off-chain casinos is very easy for government bodies. IP addresses are banned by some crypto gambling sites to prevent people from some countries from accessing their services. Users from the United States are mostly blocked when they try to play on most of the casinos that accept Bitcoin.However, government regulations also have some negative effects on distributed or decentralized internet gambling systems like on-chain casinos. This is revealed in the way Tron blocked Japanese gamblers from accessing its dapps, according to Cointelegraph. However, VPN networks are available to internet users in japan, and with these, they can access blocked dapps from anywhere in the world, including gambling dapps from Tron. In japan, issues of cryptocurrency gambling are still heavily debated, causing a lot of controversies to enthusiasts. But one thing is sure; there has not been any official guideline or regulation on this.Crypto Gambling Regulation at the Global LevelThough many countries have loads of regulations for online gambling, only a few of those capture crypto gambling. Countries that have regulations for crypto gambling include Belgium, Poland, Greece, Netherlands, Italy and the United Kingdom.In the guidelines in place in many countries about payment methods that are acceptable in casinos, Bitcoin is not seen as a legal method. So, it is not acceptable for gambling payments. In many other countries, the regulations are still shrouded in mystery and would need further interpretation. Japan is the most outstanding country in this regard, because it has a gambling industry that is worth more than $15.8 billion – up to $4 billion more than the worth of gambling in Nevada.Many online casinos and affiliate firms in the UK accept payments with cryptocurrency. But those service providers that accept crypto payments must do so in compliance with the existing regulations in the country. Sport betting is so popular in the UK, and it has developed into an industry of up to 700-million-GBP. You can also see a lot of sportsbooks that accept cryptocurrency payments on the web.Though Bitcoin gambling is approved by the gambling commission of the UK, a caveat in their website also warns people to beware of service providers that they cannot trust. The advice is for the users to apply caution when paying with Bitcoin because of the risk involved.Yet, we cannot overemphasize the benefits of cryptocurrency payments. While Bitcoin transactions are completely private, they are actually not anonymous. Bitcoin transactions do not involve the transmission of any personal information, but Procedures against Money Laundering and the Know Your Customer Rule makes it possible to ascertain the identity of anybody who attempts to convert their Bitcoin to fiat money.Furthermore, users of privacy coins like Zcach and Monero are offered increased identity protection. Though these currencies are not as popular as Bitcoin, their practice of protecting users' identity prevents law enforcement agents from investigating transactions made with them. For Hughes, people who make use of the digital currency would benefit from tighter regulations as it concerns the law.For him, nobody can blame the government for trying to play their role of regulating the financial activities of their citizens, except those that are involved in unwholesome transactions. He believes that nothing can terminate the existence of dapps any longer, because people will always find ways of using them even when the government says don’t use them.Even though cryptocurrency gambling is bedeviled by numerous technical and regulatory challenges, it’s actually beginning to witness some level of friendly reception and many casinos are beginning to accept the payment method. Both physical casinos in Las Vegas and online casinos have started accepting cryptocurrency payments, especially Bitcoin, and we expect things to get better in this angle in the long run."

April 24, 2020
","The coronavirus pandemic has sent much of the world into an economic tailspin – but for some South American nations, such as Argentina and Venezuela, financial turmoil predates the health crisis by several months. Now innovators in both countries have turned to blockchain technology and cryptocurrency in an attempt to dig the nations out of a hole that is only deepening as COVID-19’s financial fallout starts to bite harder.","In Venezuela, which per CNBC estimates last year, owes USD 100 billion to overseas creditors and has experienced inflation rates of 10 million%, the government has been pursuing what it calls “cryptoeconomics,” creating its own oil-backed cryptocurrency – with decidedly mixed results.But private-sector ventures across the border in Colombia are also attempting something new, which could potentially help Venezuelans escape the perils of hyperinflation: the cryptodollar, a bitcoin (BTC)-backed artificial United States dollar substitute.The innovation is the brainchild of Valiu, a Colombian company that specializes in cross-border remittance solutions.Valiu’s CEO, Simon Chamorro, tweeted that his team had worked “fully remotely” on the project due to the coronavirus pandemic, but noted that the project was now in alpha testing.After 4 months of 80+ hour work weeks, 500k+ lines of clean code written across 4 engineers, shifting the company f… https://t.co/0IcGNVHEULValiu says it has thousands of partner companies in Colombia, where scores of Venezuelan workers come to carry out seasonal work. The idea is that these workers can buy and send cryptodollars to relatives back home, where they can be received in smartphone-based wallets.Meanwhile, in Argentina (which this week admitted that it has missed a USD 503 million debt repayment deadline, per La Nation), high inflation has dogged the economy for several months.This has led to a surge in interest in all things crypto-related. Until recently, this interest was largely limited to the private sector and individual investors.The public sector, and the government, were initially reluctant to dabble with anything crypto-related.However, as the old adage goes: Desperate times call for desperate measures. At the tail end of 2019, the Argentinian central bank announced that it would meet with fintech and blockchain thinkers in a series of meetings. Together, they said, they would look for new approaches to fueling an economic comeback.And now it appears that these meetings are now finally bearing fruit.As reported, the Central Bank of Argentina has started promoting a proof of concept based on blockchain. This is a decentralized system solution powered by RSK smart contract technology that would allow for end-to-end traceability of account debit claims. This system, launched within the framework of the 2019 Financial Innovation Roundtable of the Central Bank of Argentina, in partnership with The Blockchain Group, is now being tested by participating banks to determine their ability to solve process integration problems between banks and system actors, after which it will be decided whether other Banks will participate and whether other potential network uses will be defined.

April 29, 2020
","Confidence that cryptocurrencies will still exist in 2030 is slightly increasing in Europe, with two-thirds of surveyed Europeans believing this to be the case, finds a new study by crypto exchange bitFlyer Europe. Italians believe in the crypto survival the most, and British the least. ","The exchange has just published the results of its yearly Crypto-Confidence index, the 2020 edition, comparing them with the results of the first poll conducted in 2019. Per the report, the index was built from a consumer poll of 10,000 respondents across ten countries in Europe. Its purpose is to show the levels of confidence in European populations when it comes to the major question of whether digital financial assets will exist in a decade from now. However, given that the poll was conducted in March, this year has brought another factor into the mix, which couldn't have been previously predicted - the coronavirus pandemic. It caused great instability in the value of both traditional and new assets.Nonetheless, the poll has revealed that two-thirds, or 66% of the 10,000 people polled, believe that cryptocurrencies will still exist in 2030. This is an increase of 3 percentage points when compared to March 2019. Additionally, the increase is noted in all but two polled countries. This shows ""that confidence continues to grow in cryptocurrencies, despite crippling effect of coronavirus on global economic landscape,"" according to the exchange. Overall, the results ""indicate a slow but steady progression of cryptocurrencies into the mainstream consciousness,"" according to Andy Bryant, COO at bitFlyer Europe.  ""Although we might look at this as an achievement for digital currencies in spite of the challenging economic times we are facing, it is also worth considering that this may well be partly because of these times,"" he added. ""This is an important time for the crypto industry to demonstrate how cryptocurrencies and associated concepts such as decentralized finance can provide attractive alternatives or even substitutes for incumbent economic models, as we battle unprecedented financial times globally and look for novel solutions,” he stressed. Also, 9% of Europeans (compared to 8% in 2019) believe that Bitcoin (BTC) will be fully integrated into society as a form of currency in 2030. The same number (compared to 7% in 2019) believe it will be used as a security or investment. Moreover, 25% of respondents - 2 percentage points more than in 2019 - replied that they are confident that cryptocurrencies will still exist in a decade, but that they have no idea how they would be used. Meanwhile, Italy, a country that has faced massive struggles and experienced a peak in pandemic-related restrictions in March, ""is the most confident,"" the report notes. Almost three-quarters, or 72%, of the polled Italians believe ""in the longevity"" of crypto. Not only that, but 12% of the Italians replied that cryptocurrencies will one day be used as a mainstream currency, making it the country with the biggest proportion of the population to believe this to be the case. The number also marks an increase by 2 percentage points compared to last year. ""It is interesting to see that countries like Italy which have been hit hard by the COVID-19 crisis are expressing more faith than ever in cryptocurrencies,"" Bryant, said.On the other side of that spectrum the report found the UK. Among the ten countries, it's ""the least confident."" Of the people polled in this country, over half of them believe cryptos will be around in ten years' time, but the UK is one of only two countries in which confidence in the future of cryptocurrencies decreased compared to last year. That said, the difference between the two years is just 1 percentage point. The 56% who believe in the crypto longevity, climbs to 61% when looking at the 18-44 age group specifically, the exchange noted. Nonetheless, only 5% of UK respondents think that cryptocurrencies will become mainstream currencies in ten years.The Netherlands and Poland follow Italy closely, with 70% of the population each responding that there's future for digital financial assets. Polish respondents are also right behind Italy when it comes to cryptos potentially becoming mainstream currencies, with 10% believing that to be the case. Meanwhile, last year's number one country, Norway, dropped to the fourth place, from 73% to 67% of the respondents being confident that cryptos have future. The percentage of consumers who believe cryptocurrencies will still exist in 10 years’ time based on March 2020 poll vs March 2019 poll:March 2019__

",The text below is an advertorial article that was not written by Cryptonews.com journalists.,"A new company has recently been causing a stir. Founded in March 2020, the WAVE platform operates the WAVE Wallet, on which Bitcoin and its own crypto currency, the WAVE token, can be stored. On the other hand, an internal crypto currency exchange has recently been added to the platform, where you can easily and conveniently trade your Bitcoin against WAVE and vice versa. Over time, more cryptocurrency pairs will be listed on the exchange and it is planned to completely transform the exchange into a decentralized exchange in 2021. Numerous other services are being developed to expand the WAVE usage system and to keep the platform always at the cutting edge of innovation. For example, a merchandise and shopping platform will be launched this year on which it will be possible to shop with the WAVE token. But how do you rate these services and the WAVE platform as a company?As a young startup, the WAVE platform is of course going through the ups and downs that companies like, Apple, Microsoft or AirBnB had to go through in their startup times as well. The WAVE platform is no different in that point. Nevertheless, figures and data have only recently become known, according to which the WAVE platform is showing strong growth and thus painting a bright picture for the future. Since its launch, the platform just recently broke the 15.000 members mark and already had a market capitalization of over 9 million $!The growth of the platform is especially strong in Europe and North America. This can be seen in the density of nodes that are already active on each continent, and on the basis of these figures, Europe as a market is clearly the front-runner for WAVE. From recent conversations with the company, it has become clear that other strongly growing countries are currently Turkey and Brazil. 
We can clearly see that with the modern vision of the company, the platform is fully in line with the trend and the current figures after this short period of time clearly underline this. We are curious to see where the WAVE platform's journey will lead and we will definitely follow it with great interest.You can find the company's website here: https://www.waveplatform.io/"

","After years of discussions over the role of the European Central Bank (ECB) and its controversial quantitative easing program, Germany's Constitutional Court has decided that it has some legal challenges.","However, German's top court ruled that the ECB can continue purchasing bonds and gave it three months to justify its policies, Bloomberg reports. According to the judges, the quantitative easing program that originally ran from early 2015 until the end of 2018, and was controversially resumed last year, isn’t backed by European Union treaties and that German authorities acted unconstitutionally by not challenging it, the report said.In 2017, a group of EU critics comprised of businessmen and academics filed a lawsuit, claiming that the ECB is conducting economic policies via the Public Sector Purchase Program (PSPP) part of the program, instead of just setting monetary policies. EUR 2.6 trillion (USD 2.9 trillion) worth of bonds and other securities was bought in those three years, with over EUR 2.1 trillion of it as part of the PSPP, according to data collected by Deutsche Welle (DW). Bloomberg reports that total holdings were EUR 2.7 trillion at the end of March, with at least EUR 300 billion more set aside to fight the coronavirus-caused recession. The ECB also created a EUR 750 billion (USD 813 billion) Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program in March ""that scraps most of the limits that constrain the other plans,"" but the court didn't include this in the ruling, though ""underlying reasoning could hold legal implications for it,"" Bloomberg says. It adds that the bank will buy more than EUR 1 trillion of debt through the end of this year, while the ECB President Christine Lagarde said the bank is “fully prepared” to increase or extend the PEPP if needed.Uwe Burkert, an economist with LBBW Bank, told DW that ""the verdict is a very explosive thing"" and Germany's central bank will be barred from taking part in the ECB's PSPP program. However, Commerzbank Chief Economist Jörg Krämer is certain that ECB will be able to prove that the program is really proportionate so as to win approval by the German government and lawmakers, and the bond buying scheme will continue. Euro fell against USD after the verdict.Meanwhile, yesterday, Tuur Demeester, Founder of Bitcoin alpha fund Adamant Capital, argued that smaller currencies will weaken versus USD in a fiat bear market.Similar to how in a crypto bear market bitcoin dominance vs altcoins increases, imo it's likely that in a fiat bear market we'll see smaller currencies weaken versus the US dollar. pic.twitter.com/4EGBqai7k7Bitcoin (BTC) is currently (13:53 UTC) trading at USD 8,955, having gone up 1.6% in a day and 15% in a week.

","Crypto Briefs is your daily, bite-sized digest of cryptocurrency and blockchain-related news – investigating the stories flying under the radar of today’s crypto news.","The Central Bank of Argentina has started promoting a proof of concept based on blockchain. According to the emailed press release, this is a decentralized system solution powered by RSK smart contract technology that would allow for end-to-end traceability of account debit claims. This system, launched within the framework of the 2019 Financial Innovation Roundtable of the Central Bank of Argentina, in partnership with The Blockchain Group, is now being tested by participating banks to determine their ability to solve process integration problems between banks and system actors, after which it will be decided whether other Banks will participate and whether other potential network uses will be defined. Hope Bridge, one of South Korea’s biggest charities, has announced that it will launch a blockchain-powered donations platform, reports Newsis. Hope Bridge says it intends to launch a dapp (decentralized app) for donors that will help it “increase the transparency of donations” by integrating blockchain technology into existing donation processes. The charity states that its new platform will also allow peer-to-peer (P2P) donations, helping speed up the rate at which beneficiaries received donors’ funds.Decentralized storage network Filecoin delayed its mainnet launch to the July-August window. They say in an update that the first round of its internal protocol security audit is completed, and that the results have shown a need for several changes to be made before moving to the second phase of its testnet. Therefore, the Testnet Phase 2 launch is estimated for the week of May 11, while the mainnet launch window is estimated from July 20 to August 21, they write.The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has allowed Bitnomial Exchange to operate as a designated contracts market (DCM), enabling it to offer Bitcoin futures and options contracts. The approval was granted on April 20. Besides this exchange, only CME, Bakkt, Cboe, ErisX, and LedgerX offer bitcoin futures and options contracts in the country. HDR Global Trading Limited, operator of the BitMEX exchange, has announced a COVID-19 Response Fund. Per the announcement, the fintech company has granted USD 2.5 million towards the global effort to respond to the pandemic. Grants of between USD 300,000 and USD 1,000,000 have been given to four organisations: Gates Philanthropy Partners, Nuclear Threat Initiative (Biosecurity Program), OpenMined, and Our World in Data.SBI Crypto, the cryptocurrency mining arm of Japanese financial giant SBI, appears to have increased its mining share in bitcoin SV (BSV) after the token’s recent halving event, per a report from Coin Post. The report’s authors point to Coin Dance data, which shows that in the past seven days, SBI Crypto has accounted for 12% of the latest BSV mining blocks, behind only the ViaBTC and TAAL mining pools. Coin Post points out that SBI’s share “has expanded rapidly from 11.5% to 16.67% in the past week.”Money on Chain, provider of a Bitcoin-collateralized stablecoin, has announced the extension of its technology to the RIF ecosystem by releasing the RIF on Chain DeFi platform backed by RIF tokens and deployed on the RSK network. Per the emailed announcement, the RIF on Chain platform will encompass three main assets that interact with each other, all three having been developed to serve different purposes: the RIF Dollar (RDOC), the RIFpro (RPRO), and RIFX.Global nonprofit Heifer International has joined the Libra Association as the 23rd official member. This comes after Libra altered its white paper, coming up with a new plan to please the regulators.Ginco, a prominent Japanese crypto wallet operator, has joined the fast-growing Japan Security Token Association (JSTA) ahead of this summer’s legislative changes, which will effectively allow Japanese companies to begin engaging in securities token offering (STO)-related business activities. The JSTA was formed in late 2019 by six major securities brokerages, but its membership has expanded rapidly in recent weeks, bringing its total membership to eight “regular” members and 12 “supporting” members, per a press release. Ginco says its wallets will be STO-token compatible. Significantly, it is the first major crypto venture to join the association.The Blockchain Association has filed an amicus brief on Friday in the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) lawsuit against messaging app Kik in a federal court in New York. The brief urges the court to a) deny the SEC’s motion for summary judgment, in which the SEC argues that Kik’s sale of Kin tokens to the public and pre-sale contracts with accredited investors both violated U.S. securities law, and b) decide the case narrowly to avoid casting doubt on cryptocurrency projects that will appear before the court in the future, the association says in an announcement."

Yet, in a peculiar turn of events, it seems that the attacker has returned the stolen funds.

More of such reports started coming in today as well, turning out that the attacker returned all the stolen funds in the end.Hacker returning dForce tokens? This is all quite interesting. pic.twitter.com/2ZtQb87kWFAs to why this person would decide to return the millions they've worked on stealing is still not known precisely, but there are speculations. One of the most popular theories is that the attacker actually revealed their IP address, meaning that it could be traced back to them. Jason Choi, Head of Research at Spartan Group, a blockchain advisory and investment firm, noted that the hacker left ""traces of identifying info when moving the loot around,"" so they have to return the funds. ""Hearing dForce hacker open to risk of dox via his vpn usage and therefore realized he may get caught,"" writes Su Zhu, CEO of Singapore-based investment management firm Three Arrows Capital. This version of events may have been confirmed. Matthew Graham, CEO of the China-based advisory company Sino Global Capital, also wondered if a revealed IP address could be the cause, sharing the information reported by Cointelegraph and The Block according to which Sergej Kunz, the CEO of 1inch.exchange, which is a decentralized exchange aggregator the hacker used to exchange some of the funds, confirmed that the attacker did indeed reveal personal metadata that may lead to their arrest.""They leaked information and public pressure made the rest!,"" commented 1inch.exchange. ""The crypto community is learning what ""script kiddies"" are,"" says independent researcher focused on blockchain, Georgios Konstantopoulos. He goes on to say that LendF.me hacker used a public exploit and without proper precautions or with a clear laundering plan.

The sharp loss today comes after HIVE gained nearly 40% on Sunday and is up more than 300% in a week. Following the latest gains, HIVE is ranked as the 42nd most valuable cryptoasset in terms of market capitalization, according to CoinMarketCap.Hive, which was listed on a number of the biggest crypto exchanges – including Binance, Huobi, and Hotbit – just this past week, has already been available for trading against bitcoin (BTC) on Bittrex since it first went into circulation in mid-March.

Following today’s losses, HIVE is now trading below its listing price in BTC terms on Bittrex, after what has been a volatile ride for investors.As previously reported, the creation of Hive is the result of an effort by the Steem community to evade a takeover of the platform by Justin Sun. Given the launch of the new blockchain network, which went live as recently as March 20 this year, and the many listing announcements seen in recent days, it appears as if the move so far has been successful for the former Steem community members.According to an earlier announcement from Hive, the new platform is a fork of Steem, “created by a large group of Steem community members,” including over thirty developers, as well as business owners and users. The platform further claims to be “the blockchain for Web 3.0,” with the core being decentralization, speed and scalability.Since coming into circulation in March, HIVE is now nearing a return of 100% for the earliest buyers, data from CoinMarketCap revealed on Tuesday."

April 23, 2020
",The coronavirus pandemic has wrought financial chaos for all sorts of assets and commodities – including a massive crypto dip and plummeting oil prices.,"But with a barrel of crude diving into the negative zone earlier this week before recovering – a crypto-related mystery is developing. How is that while cryptocurrencies experience volatility and oil prices tank, one token – the Venezuelan state-issued, oil-backed petro (PTR) – shows cast-iron resilience to the market pandemonium?Despite the fact that Venezuela has fewer ways to export its oil reserves – and the fact that the oil market has bottomed out even in major oil-exporting nations – the price of PTR 1 remains almost exactly the same as when it was first issued.Per the (government-run) petro calculator, a single petro token will currently cost you precisely USD 58.71. In fact, the official price of the petro has remained almost unchanged since Caracas issued the petro white paper back in 2018, where its price was listed as USD 60.However, there are indications that not everyone buys the official line on crypto prices. Even government-owned banks appear to disagree. Criptonoticias reports that the state-run Banco de Venezuela’s exchange rate is closer to USD 39.2 to the petro.Only a limited number of (again, state-approved) crypto exchanges currently allow Venezuelans to trade their petro tokens. Seven, to be precise, per the government’s crypto regulator. Puzzlingly (although one has recently closed down), none of these platforms currently lists a clear price for the petro.Add to this the fact that Criptonoticias also reported in January that users on peer-to-peer crypto trading platforms such as LocalBitcoins have been looking to sell their petro holdings for up to half of what the government says they are worth.P2P crypto trading platform Hodl Hodl has also been allowing users to advertise petro trades, disparaging referring to its policy of letting people dispose of their “shitcoins.”Principal propósito de Hodl Hodl: ayudar a la gente a deshacerse globalmente de mierdamonedas para Bitcoin # https://t.co/46QnYJRP69Given the fact that the majority of the oil reserves that Caracas claims underpins the petro remain unbarrelled, underground and almost unsellable due to Washington-issued sanctions, it appears that the price of the petro – which is subject to strict United States sanctions – will formally remain at whatever levels Caracas determines.The official petro calculator can be found here, in case you are curious about what the Venezuelan state believes your bolivars, bitcoin (BTC), yuan, rubles, yuan, euros or dollars are currently worth in this officially bulletproof token."

May 02, 2020
","Several crypto M&A deals have been delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the general economic uncertainty, Torbjørn Bull Jenssen, the CEO of Arcane Research, told Cryptonews.com. Also, crypto startups will need to put more effort in order to secure fresh capital, he added. ","The CEO of the crypto research firm is unable to name parties involved in delayed deals due to confidentiality. However, he also stressed “that there are deals going through, so the picture is not all negative.” Also, after the initial financial shock of a coronavirus recession, he expects to see “investment interest coming back in, after a short time out.”But because of the likelihood of a downturn, Jenssen added that crypto startups “will need to work harder for their funding.” But this will be good for crypto, because it will result in “a new hardening of the industry.”In particular, Jenssen expects more emphasis to be placed on having working products with actual customers. “One key takeaway from our experience is the increasing importance of the first paying customer,” he said. “While some investors invest in visions, plans, and the idea of ‘explosive growth now, monetization later,’ many want to see a paying customer as a live proof of concept.”Jenssen’s comments are backed up by Global Crypto M&A and Fundraising Report released in April by global consultancy powerhouse PwC. In particular, it found that fundraising was already trending towards later-stage crypto companies in 2019, in comparison to 2018.Likewise, in its prediction for 2020 fundraising trends, PwC expects that, because of the coronavirus, “the number and value of fundraising and M&A deals may be impacted as a consequence in 2020.”PwC also expects to see “further consolidation in the industry with some of the larger well funded or profitable firms buying some of the smaller players in the market.” In other words, there will be fewer new crypto startups receiving their own funding as independent firms, and more later-stage startups being bought up by bigger names.Meanwhile, the Bitcoin halving might reduce investments in the BTC mining industry. “But for other industry participants, the Bitcoin halving is viewed as a positive event with the potential to drive long term appreciation for BTC. This makes both direct investments in Bitcoin and general investments in the industry more attractive,” Jenssen said.Also, according to BitMex Research, even if the halving impacts on Bitcoin’s price, it’s unlikely to have a discernible effect on investments and deals in the wider crypto-blockchain industry.Asked if they’re aware of any particular deals or investments being affected by the current situation in the markets and/or the BTC mining reward halving event, its spokesperson replied, “No, we are not. If anything, some miners are perhaps too complacent about the halving.”"

","Dharma, an Ethereum-based crypto lender, has released a new feature that allows sending stablecoin to Twitter handles.","This peer-to-peer lending platform has announced the launch of Social Payments, which they describe as a Twitter-native financial ecosystem. They go on to say that this new service allows people to send USD to any Twitter handle, regardless of where the recipient lives or whether they have a Dharma account or not - via stablecoins. Their FAQ page states that Dharma supports only the  Dai stablecoin.So how does this new feature work? First, using the app, the user needs to deposit funds to their Dharma account, that is, deposit Dai to their Dharma deposit address, from their debit card, any crypto wallet, or from exchanges. Then they find the Twitter Handle they wish to send the funds to, and send the payment. Lastly, they can retweet the notification via the Dharma Bot Twitter account to make sure that the recipient sees it, as the bot will tweet a link to download the app. The payment doesn't follow the username, but the unchangeable twitter ID created upon the account's creation, so Twitter username can be changed and the payment's association will not be affected in any way, says Director of Engineering at Dharma, Graeme Boy.Once the Dai's been sent, the recipient can use the link the bot sent to download the app, at which point they'll need to create their account with only their email address and connect it to their Twitter account to claim the Dai. The FAQ page explains that users can withdraw their funds directly to their bank accounts, meaning that they'd receive USD, or if not available, they can withdraw Dai to a crypto address.Furthermore, the recipient earns interest as soon as somebody sends them money while it's waiting to be claimed. Interest rates are determined by the protocol of decentralized finance (DeFi) lending platform Compound, says FAQ, and they fluctuate frequently. The minimum amount for deposits or withdrawals is USD 0.01, and unlike popular payment services such as Venmo, there are no fees. Dharma is non-custodial, they say, meaning, they don't hold on to users' Dai. Therefore, there are no additional browser extension or gas fees, they say.4/ The possibilities for Social Payments are endless!-Micropayments & tips for Twitter personalities-Cross-border charitable donations-Accept payments for your business in a natively viral mannerAnd more!As reported last year, decentralized browser Brave tested a new feature for tipping tweets with BAT.

Last week, FXCoin announced that it had made a third-party allocation of shares to SBI, (which also operates its own SBI VC Trade crypto trading platform), as well as the textiles firm Asahi Kahei.Onishi also opined that government-issued stimulus measures aimed at easing the economic damage caused by the coronavirus pandemic would soon “flood global markets with cash, causing some money to flow into cryptocurrencies.” However, he warned that “there is no asset that’s absolutely safe,” but pointed to evidence that cryptoassets may not have long-term relationships with conventional assets. Another prominent Japanese analyst has also recently claimed that conventional investors will almost inevitably turn to crypto as other asset classes begin to falter.Onishi added,“I’m a bull on cryptocurrency prices.”FXcoin also states that it wants to begin XRP and litecoin (LTC) trading, and hopes to “build a swaps market to offer investors a tool to hedge against price volatility.”Meanwhile, as reported, in March, American exchange giant Coinbase became a second-tier member of the Japan Virtual Currency Exchange Association, the only officially recognized self-regulatory body of Japanese cryptocurrency exchanges."

","Crypto Briefs is your daily, bite-sized digest of cryptocurrency and blockchain-related news – investigating the stories flying under the radar of today’s crypto news. ","Alon Goren, the Founding partner at blockchain venture studio Draper Goren Holm, said today that he ""officially launched the WordPress Cryptocurrency Exchange Plugin."" ""Using Totle’s API, I created a way for anyone to add a Decentralized Crypto Exchange to their WordPress website. It’s as simple as installing the plugin and typing into any page or post on your WordPress site,"" Goren said.Gemini said that they have completed a SOC 1 Type 1 examination, which covers the financial operations and customer reporting controls of their exchange and Gemini Custody. This exam was conducted by Deloitte & Touche. Binance has stated that it will hold an online Russian-language “meetup” with its CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao as it attempts to boost its presence in Russia and the CIS. The event will see the CEO deliver a speech, along with Binance’s head of operations in Russia and CIS. The exchange says the event, to be held on April 30, will also feature a panel discussion on “crypto-economics during the COVID-19 pandemic,"" with contributions from Cardano, NEO and other projects.Tencent’s CEO Ma Huateng has written a preface to a new Chinese book about blockchain, which was published in full by media outlet the Economic Daily. In the book, named Industrial Blockchain, Ma claims that Tencent has been working on blockchain R&D initiatives since 2014, and that it has already launched blockchain-powered supply chain financing, smart taxation, judicial certificate storage, smart medical care and public welfare-related blockchain initiatives. Ma adds that the company is also working on a blockchain-powered electronic invoicing pilot program.Blockchain technology and other industry 4.0 advances have been included on an official government list of technologies to be used to manage information flows in China in the future. In a further sign of how seriously Beijing now takes all things blockchain-related, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), formerly the Chinese State Planning Commission, made specific mention of blockchain technology in a recent announcement about the future of the IT industry. Although the NDRC was non-committal when it came to concrete pledges, the commission is believed to be one of the most powerful policy-making bodies in the country.Chinese bank the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) has published what media outlets in the country are calling the commercial banking sector’s first-ever banking blockchain-related white paper. Per media outlet Sina, the paper compares the status of Chinese financial companies’ blockchain-related progress with initiatives conducted by companies based overseas, and claims that there are now 420 registered blockchain-related enterprises in China.John Roth left his position of Chief Compliance and Ethics Officer at crypto exchange Bittrex for a position at Fannie Mae - the Federal National Mortgage Association, a United States government-sponsored enterprise and a publicly-traded company the purpose of which is to expand the secondary mortgage market by securitizing mortgage loans in the form of mortgage-backed securities (MBS). According to his LinkedIn page, Roth spent two years and four months at the exchange and is now working as director of legal and regulatory compliance at Fannie Mae.Blockchain analytics specialist Chainalysis tracked just under USD 930,000 worth of bitcoin (BTC) and ethereum (ETH) payments to addresses associated with child sexual abuse material (CSAM) providers in 2019. Per their report, this represents a 32% increase over 2018, which in turn saw a 212% increase over 2017. The company attributes most of the yearly increases to rising adoption of cryptocurrency rather than an increased demand for CSAM, saying that these transactions represent a minuscule fraction of all cryptocurrency activity, but also that they're a concerning trend for the crypto industry, from both a moral and reputational standpoint."

","The XRP-affiliated fintech firm Ripple has once again reduced selling from its massive holdings of XRP tokens, this time reaching its lowest quarterly sales ever. ","According to their new report, the first quarter of this year saw XRP sales by Ripple of USD 1.75 million. The new figure comes after the company reported token sales of USD 13 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, which was a reduction of 80% from the quarter before that.In Q1 2020, “Ripple continued the pause of programmatic sales, focusing solely on its over-the-counter (OTC) sales to build XRP utility and liquidity in strategic regions including [Europe, the Middle East and Africa] and Asia,” the company said. It is unclear if these OTC sales include discounted XRP tokens that the company has admitted it offers to some institutional clients.As reported, Ripple has worked to reduce their sales of XRP over the past few quarters. However, given the earlier admission from Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse that his company “would not be profitable” without XRP sales, there might be a limit to how much Ripple, that secured USD 200 million in funding last December, can afford to reduce its sales.Also in the quarterly report, Ripple said that real-world use is increasing for its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) service that uses XRP to facilitate cross-border transactions. According to the company, the undisclosed US dollar value transacted this way increased by more than 294% in the first quarter compared to the previous quarter, partly thanks to a new partnership with UK-based remittances company Azimo.Today, XRP trades largely in line with the broader crypto market, rising 2% over the past 24 hours to a price of USD 0.223 as of press time (10:31 UTC). This compares to gains of 1% for bitcoin (BTC) and 2% for ethereum (ETH) over the same time period."

","While global regulators are warning about the risks of cryptocurrencies and private money initiatives such as Facebook's Libra, a member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank (ECB) made a somewhat surprising statement in support of ""market-led initiatives.""","In a recent blog post, Fabio Panetta emphasized that the ECB is looking into ""possible future avenues by assessing the case for issuing a ""digital euro""."" He added that there is a high-level task force exploring both the benefits and the disadvantages of introducing a digital currency that intermediaries or possibly citizens could eventually use via electronic devices for every-day spending. ""However, our analysis of the opportunities and challenges of central bank digital currencies – which will consider the experience of the COVID-19 crisis – should not discourage or crowd out market-led initiatives aimed at introducing private electronic means of payment with similar features in terms of user needs,"" he stressed.Panetta also served as Senior Deputy Governor of the Bank of Italy before joining the Executive Board at the ECB. Coincidentally, a recent survey showed that Italians are among the biggest crypto believers in Europe.Meanwhile, the statement is placed in the context of the growing demand for efficient, safe, easy-to-use, and low-cost electronic payment solutions amidst the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and lockdowns across Europe and the world - which might be here to stay for a while. Regular consumers need to be able to get money, as well as send it to their families and friends, or use it to purchase products online. Such payment systems are also necessary to ""quickly mobilize the resources made available to support small companies, self-employed workers and social institutions,"" Panetta said. But he also pointed out that this is not a novel approach for the ECB, stating that the bank had been stressing the need for Europe to ""supply fundamental services such as electronic payments autonomously, in order to strengthen its sovereignty in the global economy,"" even before the pandemic. An eventual digital euro is one potential path towards making this happen, which, as said, is still being looked into. But in the meantime, Panetta said that the goal of the Eurosystem’s retail payment strategy is ""to foster pan-European market solutions"" for instant payments at both the point-of-sale and online payments.Meanwhile, last week, the Dutch National Bank (DNB) admitted that some parts of Bitcoin’s underlying technology could be used in creating a new type of currency. DNB stressed that “the Netherlands provides a suitable testing ground for such an experiment,” and is “ready to play a leading role.” Learn more: Can CBDC Help Recover From Coronavirus Recession And Lead To Bitcoin?Another point the ECB Executive Board Member touched upon is people hoarding cash in the time of crisis. There was a spike in demand for cash once the pandemic started spreading across the continent, which the weekly increase in the value of banknotes in circulation almost reaching the historical peak of EUR 19 billion (USD 20.65 billion) mid-March. The increase reflects higher spending in supermarkets and shops, as well as ""people’s impulse to hoard cash during a crisis,"" which is not a new phenomenon. Already in early April, cash demand returned to normal levels, while several countries reported below-expected cash withdrawals for the time of year, which is partly due to the lockdown, explained Panetta.As to how the ECB is dealing with this, he said that ""the Eurosystem – the ECB and the 19 euro area national central banks (NCBs) – plans the activities related to the cash supply chain (production, storage, distribution and re-circulation) well in advance,"" thus being ""well-prepared to ensure the continued availability of banknotes in crisis times."" The NCBs have large stocks of cash, including a strategic contingency stock to cope with unexpected developments, and these stocks are continuously monitored, he adds. Nonetheless, given the major barriers the lockdowns pose, the ECB is adapting their processes ""on an ongoing basis to ensure that the banknotes supply chain remains intact,"" such as intensifying the virtual contacts between the ECB as coordinator and the NCBs, as well as at national level, between the NCBs and external partners (e.g. cash-in-transit companies and banks). As reported, the ""central bank of central banks"" - the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) - and multiple analysts think that the fear of the coronavirus transmission via cash and banking cards may shorten the road to CBDCs. Both the BIS and the ECB through their respective research found that coronaviruses can survive more easily on a stainless steel surface and can be transferred more easily from plastic compared to cotton banknotes. ""Overall, banknotes do not represent a particularly significant risk of infection compared with other kinds of surface that people come into contact with in daily life,"" said the ECB, noting that their research into this continues.

","How did you celebrate your seventh birthday? With a cake, party games and balloons? Not so for the biggest crypto market data provider CoinMarketCap, whose operators decided to fete the seventh anniversary of the site’s founding by asking all-comers to take part in a roast on that most unforgiving of platforms, Twitter.","In an accompanying blog post, CoinMarketCap (CMC) gave itself a hearty pat on the back, too, listing many of its achievements. And it got the roast off to a gentle start, quipping that “our website occasionally loads like it’s 1999.”But the world of social media is rarely so restrained, and some users relished in the opportunity to let rip in what has already become a riveting Twitter thread.Some decided to go the whole hog (pardon the pun), with a video full of allegations about CMC’s seemingly sky-high high tolerance levels for shitcoins, fake tokens and exit scams.I heard @CoinMarketCap is asking for people to roast them. Good morning! #RoastCMC https://t.co/AM7klXPiamChangpeng Zhao, CEO of major crypto exchange Binance that recently acquired CMC, jumped in to take a swipe, not so much at CMC itself, but rather at arch crypto skeptic Peter Schiff.#RoastCMCHowever, it looks like the CoinMarketCap team (or their PR agency friends) were ready to give as good as they got.

","A Polish blockchain company says that its user numbers are up despite the pressures of the coronavirus pandemic, and says that investors are flocking to a gaming sector that is booming – in spite of the health crisis pandemic.","GamerHash says that building on improved results it is now eying expansion to Asia, and also wants to launch its own token.Owned by the Poznań-based company CoinAxe, GamerHash purports to allow users to share excess computer power when PC users watch movies, play games in play-and-earn model sessions or browse the internet – using leftover power to mine cryptocurrencies.With more than 450,000 users registered in 125 countries worldwide, the start-up says it has noticed a significant increase in user activity since the coronavirus lockdown was initiated in Poland, its largest market.Poland was one of the first European Union nations to close its borders in the wake of the outbreak’s spread to Europe, and much of its population has been in lockdown for the past six-seven weeks.Artur Pszczółkowski, the start-up’s chief managing officer and co-owner tells Cryptonews.com,“We have noticed a 70% increase in user activity per day since the pandemic began, and our platform now attracts about 15,000 users per month. We’ve also noticed a surge in interest from both domestic and foreign investors. We’re currently in the process of closing a seed funding round, and I spend about 10 hours a day talking to investment fund operators.”Pszczółkowski adds,“Gaming, e-commerce and streaming are the three sectors that are attracting massive interest from investors during the pandemic, but the latter two are already dominated by major players, and investors know that it is challenging to find undervalued opportunities there.”However, Pszczółkowski says GamerHash’s core business is cryptocurrency mining. He says that the company’s prime pitch to users is the following: Make crypto while playing your favorite games or watching movies.The CMO claims,“We let anyone earn crypto, often in the range of USD 20 to 30 per month, solely by using the capacities of their computer’s CPU and GPU. Our algorithms analyze users’ devices, checking to see which cryptocurrency best fits their computer’s technical specifications. Many of our users don’t even care which crypto they mine as long as they are rewarded!” The GamerHash executive adds,“We offer them various ways to spend crypto: We operate a marketplace with 600 digital products, such as Netflix subscriptions. And we also allow users to store their crypto in their wallets, or spend tokens through an app that allows them to make use of use QR codes to shop for groceries at local stores.”The platform’s users, says its operators, can mine 12 cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin (BTC), litecoin (LTC), ravencoin (RVN) https://cryptonews.com/coins/ravencoin/ and monero (XMR).As mentioned, in the near future, GamerHash is also aiming to launch its own token.The CMO states, “We have established a subsidiary in Malta that will launch the token, and we’re currently finalizing a seed funding in parallel with this.” He states that the round could raise “up to USD 2.8 million.”He states that the company has not yet started the first phase of its private toke sale. However, Pszczółkowski states that the company “already has commitments for USD 150,000” with “a few bigger tickets” with “further commitments incoming” – meaning that reaching a soft cap of USD 1.2 million “should be easy.”Pszczółkowski adds,“During the summer, we will allow people to buy our token via our ambassadors. As a next step, after the summer, GamerHash will list the token on a number of partner exchanges in Europe and Asia. We have already concluded these talks.”While Poland remains the start-up’s main market, in the long-term, GamerHash plans to tap into the potential of Asian markets – the main objective of its current fundraising activities with venture capital investments.The co-founder explains,“In Europe, cryptocurrency mining is expensive because of its high electricity prices. Our focus is now on Asia, and we’re cooperating with a VC fund from Singapore to expand there. We want to set up a subsidiary in Singapore to facilitate our expansion to various Asian markets, including Malaysia, South Korea, Vietnam and Singapore. Japan is also on our list, but it’s a difficult market. As such, it is best to first secure a foothold in other countries and have a good track record there before eventually setting up shop in Japan.” The company even has its sights set on the biggest Asian player of all: the Middle Kingdom.“China is a huge market,” concludes the CMO, “But, because of its regulatory instability, it makes more sense to be an established player before you launch your business activities there.”As reported, crypto-focused startups will need to work harder for their funding while more emphasis to be placed on having working products with actual customers."

",Disclaimer: The text below is a press release that was not written by Cryptonews.com.,"HASHWallet, a Highly Secured Crypto Hardware Wallet Announces the Start of its sales on INDIEGOGOHASHWallet, an innovative hardware wallet designed to safeguard crypto-assets in the shape of a convenient smart card full of premium features — announces the start of its sales on INDIEGOGO. Sales of HASHWallet, the most secured hardware wallet, is set to start on April 28th, 2020.From the dawn of the Internet data breaches have been one of the major challenges internet users, organizations, and governments struggle with. According to research, in 2013, almost 3 million customer credit card records were stolen from the Adobe database. Additionally, information pertaining to 60 million users was accessed on the U.S Postal Service database. Consequently, these breaches come with financial costs and can ruin customer trust, which is why the need for data security is very crucial. If we take a look at the Crypto ecosystem, the situation is not better. In 2019, 4.4 billion dollars in Crypto assets have been stolen or lost. The losses grow with the increasing number of users and the value of the assets in the market. In 2017 this figure rose to 1.2 billion and in 2018 it reached 1.8 billion dollars. There is ten times more fraud per user, than in the traditional financial sector.Thankfully, HASHWallet’s hardware wallet has solved the long-existing security challenge that has made many Crypto users lose sleep over their crypto assets. In fact, it brings together the strongest level of security with the ease of use.HASHWallet Brings a Unique Discovery solution to Crypto Assets Security in the Shape of a Premium Smart CardMany consumers today see crypto-assets as a fast-track to easy wealth. But yet, many are still scared to own and store them because they are ‘virtual,’ and you can’t actually hold them. Coupled with the news on how big ‘security-focused’ crypto exchanges are getting hacked, many crypto users/ investors have thought it wise to get a crypto hard wallet and get full control of their assets.So, whether you are knowledgeable or not, it is important to know this: in a decentralized system, the user is the only one keeper of the security of his/her assets; and transactions here are non-reversible. That is, there is nobody to be held responsible to cover any fraud loss if it happens.Actually, since the inception of the earliest cryptocurrencies, it’s no doubt that many crypto users have lost their assets via loss of private keys, key hacking, keystroke logging, phishing attacks, and so on. Thankfully, a safe haven to these existing challenges have arrived, it’s HASHWallet.HASHWallet is an innovative hardware wallet primarily designed to safeguard your crypto-assets in the shape of a “handy smartcard” loaded with premium features. Interestingly, it’s so environmentally secured that as a user, you can comfortably use it to authenticate or sign a transaction anywhere without worrying about risk or impersonation or losing your key. In other words, you can perform transactions anytime, anywhere without any atom of worry.Months ago, HASHWallet entered into Arrow Certification Program. After a thorough review of their idea, ArrowGlobal found HASHWallet to be one of the outstanding innovative technologies in the crypto space. HASHWallet got endorsed and received the “Arrow Certified Technology” Badge, meaning that engineers from Arrow have assessed the project and evaluated it as feasible for manufacturing.Here are some unique features HASHWallet is equipped with:High-Level Security and Ease of Use
HASHWallet is the first non-programmable hardware wallet, hence it offers a more secure environment for users to verify transactions. Here, a large e-ink screen is used to check and approve transactions, which complies with the security philosophy “What You See Is What You Sign (WYSIWYS)”. This feature eliminates the potential for fraud and avoids the so-called “Man in the middle” attack. What’s more, the private key on the smart card can never be extracted by anyone, even by the user itself. As such, the keys can neither be lost nor stolen.HASHWallet also features an intuitive user interface that makes it easy for everyone to operate. Whether you are new to the cryptocurrency space, or you have little or no knowledge of gadgets, you can operate this wallet with ease. Seamless Connectivity
HASHWallet supports both Bluetooth and NFC connections to pair the device with your HASHWallet Manager App and with the Recovery Card. Also, its connectivity features enable new 3rd party integrations in future developments. Bluetooth connectivity, for instance, creates an encrypted two-way communication between the card and your smartphone or computer. The latter enables received transactions to be signed and returned, depending on whether they are signed or rejected on the e-Ink WYSIWYS screen.Under other conditions, NFC connectivity provides a means of recording the Recovery Card and receiving data when the HASHWallet is to be recovered. The connectivity will also be used to facilitate NFC payments in the future.Biometric Security Authentication
Biometric authentication is no doubt one of the highest levels of Security and usability in this digital age that protects human identity. Interestingly, HASHWallet has also implemented this technology to provide the cardholders with topnotch security standards. In other words, its advanced fingerprint reader allows the verification of your identity to sign any form of transaction in a highly secured environment.Easy Recovery Process
Above all, one of the primary concerns of crypto users is counting on an effective and confident key recovery process. This has been an existing issue because most of the current solutions have been tagged to be cumbersome.However, HASHWallet has made this recovery process an easy one. As a crypto user, you no longer have to lose sleep when you lose your key to your crypto coins. HASHWallet comes with a Recovery Card to provide an alternative way to access your funds if the wallet is lost. While activating HASHWallet for the first time, the Recovery Card is paired to the device via NFC. As a result, your Recovery Seed is stored on this card. The device also generates a ‘Recovery Key’ that can be stored externally into the eSignus Vault or by the user’s resources.Also if it happens that you no longer have access to the HASHWallet, you can fall back on these two secure elements. All that is required is to purchase another HASHWallet and use one of the Seed cards to enter the Recovery Seed and Recovery Key. Your funds will then be accessible from the new smart card. Additionally, HASHWallet crypto support prowess is mindblowing — it actively supports all the major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Stellar Lumens…  and can host any ERC-20 token.
