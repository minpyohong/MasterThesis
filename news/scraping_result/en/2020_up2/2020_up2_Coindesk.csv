Analysts say the data ...","May 6, 2020 at 18:20 UTC","With a key metric declining to record lows, bitcoin’s options market may be underpricing cryptocurrency’s future volatility. Analysts say the data is being distorted by “Black Thursday’s” 40% drop. ","The spread between bitcoin’s three-month implied volatility (IV) and historical or realized volatility (RV) fell to -47% on Wednesday, the lowest since the crypto derivatives research firm Skew began tracking the data 18 months ago. The spread turned negative in March and has continued to drop ever since.  “Historically, RV has been lower than IV for bitcoin over the last 18 months, except for a short period in the months around September 2019,” noted analytics resource Arcane Research in its monthly report.Implied volatility is the market’s expectation of how risky or volatile an asset will be in the future. It is computed by taking an option and the underlying asset’s price along with other inputs such as time to expiration. Realized, or historical, volatility is the standard deviation from the average price of the underlying asset. It measures volatility actually realized in the past. Volatility has a positive impact on options price. Higher volatility (uncertainty) leads to stronger hedging demand and a higher price for both call (bullish bet) and put options (bearish bet). Bitcoin’s three-month implied volatility is hovering near its lifetime average of 4.2%, a sign options appear to be fairly valued.Traders often expect volatility to be mean reverting, meaning it typically rises after it gets too low and falls after it gets too high, in the process influencing options prices. As a result, seasoned traders keep track of changes in the IV-RV spread, the differential between implied volatility and its lifetime average.Options prices are considered to be cheap if the IV-RV spread suggests the implied volatility is too low compared to the realized volatility or the average implied volatility. Alternatively, options are considered to be overvalued if the implied volatility is too high compared to its lifetime average or historical volatility. Put simply, options traders buy calls or puts when implied volatility is too low, the logic being that IV will rise back toward its mean, making options dearer. Meanwhile, traders sell options when implied volatility is too high on hope that IV will fall back toward its mean, making options cheaper. Investors may read the recent drop in bitcoin’s three-month IV-RV spread as a sign the expected volatility is too low and options prices are very cheap compared to historical standards. However, that is not necessarily the case because the three-month realized volatility is distorted and being held high by bitcoin’s 40% drop registered on March 12. Read more: What's Next for Bitcoin After March's Crash – CoinDesk Quarterly Review“The three-month realized volatility still includes that 12th of March point where bitcoin sold off around 40% in a single day,” said Skew’ CEO Emmanuel Goh, while adding that after mid-June the realized volatility would fall as the March 12 data point will be excluded from calculations. Validating Goh’s argument is the fact that short-duration realized volatility metrics have come down sharply from March’s lofty heights. The 10-day realized volatility is seen at 80% at press time, down significantly from the high of 321% registered on March 21. Meanwhile, one-month RV stands at 72%, having topped out at 200% on April 21. Bitcoin’s three-month implied volatility is hovering near its lifetime average of 4.2% at press time, a sign options appear to be fairly valued.However, both volatility (uncertainty) and option prices are likely to rise as we head closer to next Tuesday’s mining reward halving. The programmed code will reduce rewards per block mined to 6.25 BTC from 12.25 BTC. Read more: Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Nears All-Time High in Final Adjustment Before HalvingWhile most analysts have hailed the supply-altering event as positive for bitcoin’s price, historical data indicates scope for a short-term pullback. Uncertainty tends to rise ahead of such binary events, boosting demand for option prices.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The seven-day moving ...","Apr 30, 2020 at 17:50 UTC","Large crypto investors, popularly known as “whales,” seem to be accumulating bitcoin amid the ongoing price rally. ","The seven-day moving average of the number of addresses holding 10,000 bitcoins or more rose to 111 on Wednesday, the highest level since Aug. 2, 2019, according to blockchain intelligence firm Glassnode. That number has risen by more than 11% since early March. “The increase in the number of BTC addresses with more than 10,000 BTC is likely the result of long-term holders coming back online to expand their holdings,” said Matthew Dibb, co-founder of Stack, a provider of cryptocurrency trackers and index funds. Increased interest from long-term holders and large investors could be associated with the bullish narrative surrounding the macro factors and the upcoming reward halving. “Some of these addresses may belong to high-net-worth individuals or groups, who are diversifying into bitcoin amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and ahead of the mining reward halving, due in the next two weeks,” said Wayne Chen, CEO of Interlapse Technologies and founder of Coincurve, a cryptocurrency purchasing, and spending platform. Bitcoin’s supply is capped at 21 million and its monetary policy is pre-programmed to cut the pace of supply expansion by 50 percent every four years. Hence, many advocates tout bitcoin as a safe haven asset and an inflation-hedge like gold. They claim the economic destruction caused by the coronavirus pandemic and the unprecedented money printing exercises undertaken by the global central banks and governments to bode well for bitcoin’s price. “Amid the deteriorating economic outlook for the U.S. economy and the likelihood of an ever-increasing monetary supply, which weakens the U.S. dollar and stokes inflation fears, we believe bitcoin could easily test previous highs above $19,000 as investors look for safe havens away from traditional assets,"" said Simon Peters, analyst and crypto asset expert at global investment platform eToro. Such bullish predictions have been doing the rounds for more than six weeks now and could have enticed large investors to add bitcoins to their portfolio. Further, expectations that the mining reward halving, due on May 12, would put bitcoin on a long-term bullish trend could be the reason for the rise in the number of so-called “whale addresses.”Bitcoin undergoes a process called mining reward halving every four years, which controls inflation by reducing mining rewards by 50%. Following the May 2020 halving, the reward per block mined will drop from 12.5 BTC to 6.25 BTC.  See also: Bitcoin Halving, Explained Many investors anticipate the cryptocurrency’s price would go up after halving, as the asset would become more scarce to satisfy the demand. Reinforcing this belief is the historical data, which shows bitcoin experienced solid bull runs in the year following previous halvings.“At the first halving in November 2012, the price went from $11 to over $1100 a coin a year later. Then after the second halving in July 2016, bitcoin went from $600 to over $20,000 by the end of 2017,"" said George McDonaugh, managing director and co-founder of publicly listed cryptocurrency and blockchain investment firm KR1 plc.However, reward halving also means a 50% reduction in miners’ revenue. So, if the price fails to rally sharply post-halving, small and inefficient miners may shut down operations and offload their holdings to cover costs, leading to a price drop.  Bitcoin was trading near $8,900 at press time, a 130% gain from the low of $3,867 reached on March 13, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index. Bitcoin is now reporting a bigger year-to-date gain compared to gold. While the cryptocurrency is up 21%, the yellow metal has seen a 12% increase. The year-to-date performance may reinforce the narrative that bitcoin is a hedge against global economic malaise, fiscal and monetary indiscipline and could continue to draw demand from both small and large investors. See also: Stacking Sats? Small Bitcoin Holders on the Rise, Data Suggests""The year-to-date performance indicates that investors’ awareness of the digital asset has increased and its role as a potential diversification vehicle for traditional portfolios has been underscored by its strong recovery from its recent lows, relative to more traditional markets. We expect this strength to persist as Bitcoin continues to take pole position in the race,"" said Stack's Dibb. The rise in the number of unique addresses holding more than 10,000 bitcoins does not necessarily mean an influx of new whales into the market. After all, a single investor can hold multiple addresses. Further, cryptocurrency exchanges tend to hold large balances. For instance, two of the top five addresses on the rich list (a table of the addresses holding the most bitcoins), published by bitinfocharts.com, belong to prominent exchanges Huobi and Bitfinex.See also: The ‘Great Lockdown’ Is Boosting Demand for Bitcoin Custody Solutions“Some of these addresses are owned by top exchanges which usually hold large reserves in their cold wallet. So this doesn’t necessarily signal a clear behavior for market activity,” said Coincurve’s Chen. The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

2,www.coindesk.com,,Bitcoin Node Count Falls to 3-Year Low Despite Price Surge - CoinDesk,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-node-count-falls-to-3-year-low-despite-price-surge,"The number of computers running the Bitcoin program fell to its lowest 
level in almost three years, according to data calculated by one ...","May 6, 2020 at 18:56 UTC","The number of computers running the Bitcoin program fell to its lowest level in almost three years, according to data calculated by one prominent Bitcoin developer. ","Bitcoin’s total node count fell below 47,000 on Monday, a level not seen since 2017, based on estimates determined by well-regarded Bitcoin developer Luke Dashjr. His numbers show a steady decline in the number of operational nodes from a peak of over 200,000 in January 2018.A decline in total node count means fewer people are participating in validating new transactions and storing copies of the network's shared transaction history. The new lows count comes at a time of recent surges in price and mining power.Tallying the number of Bitcoin nodes typically relies on estimates instead of concrete data, and opinions on the best methodology for deriving these estimates differ. Dashjr’s estimate relies on a tedious and undisclosed proprietary methodology that could compromise the reliability of the data if it was released, according to its creator.See also: Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Nears All-Time High in Final Adjustment Before HalvingAnother well-known Bitcoin node count tally, provided for free by Bitnodes, shows fresh multi-year lows in the number of Bitcoin IPv4 nodes in mid-March. This helps to corroborate Dashjr’s data. However, since November Bitnodes data has shown a spike in nodes using onion services, which make the node operator more difficult to locate.Curiously, the last bitcoin bull cycles were preceded by significant spikes in new Bitcoin nodes coming online, according to Dashjr.’s estimates. But since April 2019, the total node count estimate has steadily fallen despite periods of relatively bullish price action. Underwhelming price action or recent market crashes may have caused some investors and node operators to simply lose interest and shut off their nodes.After price crashes, plenty of Bitcoin users “lose interest and stop opening their wallets or running their nodes,” said Jameson Lopp, CTO and co-founder of Casa, a bitcoin storage security company.  Lopp considers Bitcoin nodes that continue to run despite market behavior to be “nodes of last resort.” More people also may be shutting off their Bitcoin nodes because, for them, running the software is just too hard. According to Dashjr, “Running a [Bitcoin] node continues to get harder and harder with block sizes exceeding the rate of technological improvement.”Full Bitcoin nodes don’t mine for new bitcoins. Instead, they store individual copies of the blockchain to protect the universal ledger’s accuracy and they allow users to verify transactions issued on the network.See also: Bitcoin Wallets Are Adopting This Tech to Simplify Lightning PaymentsA dropping node count might not be a problem for the network, provided that “enough” nodes are still operating, said Matt Corallo, full-time open-source bitcoin developer at Square.“Ultimately, the raw number is unimportant. What matters are two things: Are users who transact materially with Bitcoin checking transactions against their own full node, and are there enough nodes to service chain downloads for new nodes,” Corallo explained.But the definition of ""enough"" is “super hard,” he said.Note: This story originally referred to the developer as Luke Jr., his original moniker.

3,www.coindesk.com,,"Bitcoin Price May Drop After Halving, Historical Data Shows - CoinDesk",https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-price-may-drop-after-halving-historical-data-shows,"The top cryptocurrency by market value has risen by over 130% since 
bottoming out at $3,867 on March 13 according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin ...","May 4, 2020 at 10:30 UTC","Bitcoin has again rallied sharply in the weeks leading up to its impending halving event. But if historic patterns are anything to go by, the cryptocurrency could suffer a temporary price pullback following the supply-altering event. ","The top cryptocurrency by market value has risen by over 130% since bottoming out at $3,867 on March 13 according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index. The cryptocurrency jumped from $6,700 to $9,400 in the last 10 days of April alone. What's more, prices gained over 15% last week to register bitcoin's first seven-week winning streak in 12 months.Notably, the big gains have happened in the weeks leading up to the mining reward halving, due on May 12, and are reminiscent of similar price rallies seen ahead of the previous two halvings, which took place in 2016 and 2012. See also: Bitcoin Halving, Explained The term ""halving"" refers to a programmed-in event in bitcoin's code, which reduces the reward per block mined by 50% every four years to control inflation. Following the upcoming halving, rewards issued will drop to 6.25 BTC from the current 12.5 BTC. Bitcoin appreciated by 34% from $9.5 to $12.75 in the four weeks to Nov. 28, 2012, when mining rewards were trimmed by 50% for the first time.The cryptocurrency underwent its second halving on July 9, 2016. On that day, it was trading near $660, representing over 45% gain on the low of $440 observed in mid-May (though it peaked at $780 in mid-June).Bitcoin also witnessed unprecedented gains in 12 to 15 months following previous halvings. For instance, the cryptocurrency rose to a record high of $20,000 in December 2017.Some observers expect bitcoin to chart a similar uptrend following the May 2020 supply cut. “Halving will reduce the amount of bitcoin’s rewarded to miners, thereby reducing the supply of coins entering the market. Not only does halving boost the price as a result of the added scarcity, but the additional media attention and the positive impact this has had on bitcoin prices historically will drive up demand,"" said Don Guo, CEO of Broctagon Fintech Group.Investors, however, should note that the previous bull runs did not start immediately after halvings. In fact, the 2016 halving was followed by a notable price drop. Bitcoin traded in a sideways manner for over two weeks following its second halving and fell to $465 on Aug. 2 – a loss of nearly 30% from the halving day price of $660.  The fresh record high above $1,160 was set nearly eight months after the supply cut. The upward momentum gathered pace in the following months and prices reached $20,000 in December 2017.Some investors would argue the cryptocurrency remained bid following its first halving on Nov. 28, 2012. However, back then the community was quite small and primarily consisted of “believers,” who cheered the first supply cut.That said, prices rose only 6% from $12.75 to $13.50 in the two weeks after halving and remained sidelined in the following five weeks. “The bitcoin halving has been a long-standing topic among the crypto community, with many feeling that any influences on price have already been ‘baked’ into the current price range we’re seeing today,” said Nick Cowan, CEO of the GSX Group, a provider of financial services and exchange ecosystem. Indeed, the event has been extensively discussed for over a year. CoinDesk published the first article regarding the May 2020 halving on Dec. 31, 2018. See also: Bitcoin’s Halving Is Irrelevant for Some Large TradersOn-chain data suggests both small and large investors are accumulating coins in the run-up to the event. As a result, a bout of profit taking may be seen after May 12. Some investors, especially short-term traders, may sell their coins after halving, putting downside pressure on prices.One result of the halving is it will double the cost of mining. Hence, if there is a post-halving price pullback, older-generation mining machines like the Antminer S9s would yield losses, forcing miners to scale back operations or leave the industry. Hard-hit miners may offload their holdings to cover costs, adding to downside pressures around prices. Some miners may take advantage of the recent price rise by liquidating their crypto earnings over the next 12 days. “That will allow them to keep accumulating bitcoin post-halving,” said Ashish Singhal, CEO, and founder of the cryptocurrency exchange Coinswitch.co. The May 2020 halving is different from the previous two events because it is happening against the backdrop of the coronavirus crisis. ""This bitcoin halving will certainly be different to the last, as Satoshi Nakamoto’s economic system will have the opportunity to prove its resilience and strength in comparison with traditional Wall Street protocols,"" said Andy Ji, co-founder of Ontology, the public blockchain and distributed collaboration program.The COVID-19 pandemic has shaken the global economy and forced governments and central banks across the globe to add trillions of dollars of stimulus to the financial system. The global economy was in relatively better shape when the cryptocurrency experienced its second supply cut in July 2016. Notably, China’s producer price index, or factory-gate prices, bottomed out in the first quarter of 2016 and turned positive in September of that year, triggering a reflationary bull market in commodities and equities. Put simply, people currently have a strong reason to search for alternatives like bitcoin, which are getting scarcer with every halving. As a result, notable price dips, if any, could be short-lived and the odds of bitcoin setting new highs next year look strong. “Amid the deteriorating economic outlook for the U.S. economy and the likelihood of an ever-increasing monetary supply, which weakens the dollar and stokes inflation fears, we believe it could easily test previous highs above $19,000 as investors look for safe havens away from traditional assets,” said Simon Peters, a crypto asset expert at global investment platform eToro.While bitcoin has put in a
solid positive performance ahead of halving, the ascent seems to have run out
of steam over the past couple of days. The cryptocurrency is trading near $8,650 at press time, representing a 3% drop on the day, having failed to keep gains above $9,000 in the last four days, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index. The traditional markets are also flashing red on Monday, with futures tied to the S&P 500 reporting a 0.5% loss. Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar is drawing haven demand against the Chinese yuan and growth-linked currencies like the Australian and New Zealand dollars. So investors are shunning risk, possibly due to the growing conflict over U.S. claims about China's handling of the coronavirus outbreak. If the risk aversion worsens, bitcoin may extend the drop toward the 200-day average at $8,000. Most analysts, however, still expect the cryptocurrency to test five figures ahead of the halving. ""Though the initial surge to $10K stalled at $9,400, look for a further thrust to break the $10K level followed by a retreat post-halving, with constant forward progress through 2020,"" said Jehan Chu, co-founder and managing partner at Hong Kong-based blockchain investment and trading firm Kenetic Capital. Chu added that institutional interest and engagement in bitcoin and crypto are at peak levels heading into the critical halving event. Open interest or open positions in futures listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which is considered synonymous with the institutional activity, rose to $339 million on Friday – the highest level since July 10, 2019, according to data provided by the crypto derivatives research firm Skew. The metric has risen sharply from the low of $107 million observed on March 12.Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency at the time of writing.

Those trades betting on crypto prices going downward have not returned to derivatives exchanges like BitMEX, said Vishal Shah, an options trader and founder of exchange platform Alpha5. “What we saw yesterday was a collapse in open interest, and no real premium being built into the futures curve,” he told CoinDesk. As short sellers were wiped out on BitMEX Thursday during the bitcoin price spike, open interest dropped and it hasn’t recovered. “It's tough for me to digest that there's new capital funneling in; it's likely capital within the ecosystem sloshing around and targeting pain points,” Shah added. “It feels pretty firm, with the next battle trench likely in the $7,850 - $8,000 region.”Inflows are needed to push crypto prices higher. Bitcoin’s year-to-date high was $10,510 on spot exchanges like Coinbase back on Feb. 13 and more capital into crypto will be needed to push the markets higher. “Demand continues to be steady. You have to remember that for bitcoin to stay at these levels, you need inflows of new dollars matching supply of new coins,” said Daniel Masters, chairman of U.K.-based asset manager CoinShares. That being said, Masters anticipates most investors holding rather than selling ahead of the bitcoin halving in mid-May - with the exception of miners, who need cash to pay for operational expenditures like energy costs and data center leases.Read More: Bitcoin Halving, Explained“Analysis of wallets shows most tourists and speculators have sold, meaning we don’t expect many folks to sell into the halving except for miners who may be anticipating some pain around and are trying to lock in opex costs,” said Masters.As bitcoin remains in sideways trading and price is flat, ether (ETH) has lost less than 1 percent in the past 24 hours.

5,www.coindesk.com,,Why Global Deflation May Not Be Bad News for Bitcoin - CoinDesk,https://www.coindesk.com/why-global-deflation-may-not-be-bad-news-for-bitcoin,"Contrary to expectations, bitcoin could see a positive performance during a

Talk of deflation began earlier this month after the U.S. reported massive job losses due to the coronavirus outbreak. The prospects of a deflationary collapse have strengthened with this week’s oil price crash. “The oil price rout will send a deflationary wave through the global economy,” tweeted popular macro analyst Holger Zschaepitz on Tuesday.Read more: First Mover: What the Oil Price Collapse Means for Bitcoin’s Halving ValuationCash typically becomes king during deflation because the drop in the general price levels boosts the monetary unit’s purchasing power, or the ability to purchase goods and services. “Unlike inflation, when people try to get out of the dollar because it's losing value, during deflation people are more comfortable with the dollar because its value is going up,” said Erick Pinos, ecosystem lead for the Americas at the public blockchain and distributed collaboration platform Ontology.The rush for cash, however, may not have a substantially negative impact on bitcoin’s price because deflation would also boost the purchasing power of the cryptocurrency. “While the price per coin may stagnate during a period of aggressive economic deflation, the inherent buying power of the currency will actually rise, possibly quite significantly,” said Brandon Mintz, CEO of the bitcoin ATM provider Bitcoin Depot.As time goes on and people become more comfortable with digital assets, the average person begins to see Bitcoin as a legitimate viable alternative to gold. The uptick in the purchasing power will likely draw greater demand for bitcoin, as the cryptocurrency is already used as means of payment. “Hundreds of thousands of businesses, brands and merchants do accept the ‘digital gold’ as payment, and thousands more every day are realizing the benefits of diversifying their revenue stream and accepting bitcoin as payment for their goods and services,” said Derek Muhney, director of sales and marketing at Coinsource, the world’s leader in Bitcoin ATMs.Moreover, the cryptocurrency’s appeal as a medium of exchange is likely to continue strengthening with the growing prevalence of technology in consumers' everyday lives caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Ever since its inception, bitcoin has been dubbed “digital gold.” Like the yellow metal, the cryptocurrency is durable, fungible, divisible, recognizable and scarce. Both assets share features that fulfill Aristotle’s call for a currency to be practical and functional. Bitcoin has actual utility as the means of payment, which gold lacks, according to Coinsource’s Muhney. “As time goes on and people become more comfortable with digital assets, the average person begins to see Bitcoin as a legitimate viable alternative to gold. Thus, it's reasonable to assume that during a period of deflation bitcoin would perform well like gold has in the past,” said Erick Pinos, America's ecosystem lead at the public blockchain and distributed collaboration platform Ontology.Read more: Looking for a Safe Haven Digital Asset? Try GoldHence, gold’s performance during the previous bouts of deflation could serve as a guide for bitcoin investors. Historical data shows gold performs well during deflation, which includes a sharp rise in financial stress and increased risk of corporate defaults; highly levered companies tend to go bust during deflation because their revenues fall while their debt service payments remain the same. Of course, gold’s shine is particularly bright during periods of inflation as well. As in periods of sizable deflation, inflation brings a set of price distortions that shake-up income statements and economies. A commonly-used measure of stress is the “Ted spread” or the difference between the three-month U.S. interbank rate and the three-month T-Bill rate. ""Massive spikes in the Ted spread in the 1970s were accompanied by a sharp rise in gold.  The Ted spread also rose sharply in the early 1980s; in 1987 in the wake of the stock market crash and during the global financial crisis of 2007-2009 – both also periods of stronger gold prices,"" according to Oxford Economics' research note. The real or inflation-adjusted price of gold rose an average 33 percent per annum in the 1970s, 18 percent in 1980s and 15.8 percent in 2000. Underscoring all of the scenarios is that a sudden rise in economic stress usually fuels a global dash for cash, forcing investors to sell everything from stocks to gold. However, once economic uncertainty starts settling, people again start looking for safe havens. “During the Great Recession, while gold initially declined alongside other equities, it found its footing and rallied faster than stocks recovered,” Ontology’s Pinos told CoinDesk. The Ted spread spiked as high as 4.6 following the collapse of Lehman Brothers in August 2008. Gold fell from $920 to $680 per troy ounce in the August to October period, as investors treated the yellow metal as a source of liquidity, but still ended that year with 5.5 percent gains. More importantly, it rallied by 24 percent in 2009 and went on to hit a record high above $1,900 in 2011. Read more: First Mover: Bitcoin Jumps as Fed Assets Top $6.5T and Traders Focus on HalvingThe yellow metal’s recent price gyrations suggest history may be repeating itself. As the Ted spread rose from 0.11 to 1.42 in the four weeks to March 27, gold fell from $1,700 to $1,450 yet is now trading near $1,725 per ounce, having hit a 7-year high of $1,747 ten days ago. Bitcoin, too, was treated as a source of liquidity last month, as evidenced from the near 40 percent drop to levels under $4,000 seen on March 12. Since then, however, the cryptocurrency has risen by nearly 85 percent to $7,500.If gold’s historical data and the recent market activity is a guide, then the path of least resistance for bitcoin appears to be on the higher side. Both the U.S. government and the Federal Reserve have unleashed massive amounts of liquidity into the system over the past few weeks to contain the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. Notably, the Fed is running an open-ended asset purchase program and its balance sheet has already risen to record highs above $6.5 trillion. Meanwhile, central banks from New Zealand to Canada have slashed rates to zero and have recently announced bond purchase programs. What’s more, the amount of fiscal stimulus announced by 22 countries in March is equivalent to 75 percent of the global gross domestic product (GDP), according to JPMorgan.However, most governments and central banks appear to have run out of ammo. Hence, if the coronavirus pandemic continues to spread or leads to corporate defaults, investors may lose trust in traditional finance and look for alternatives like bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general. Moody's Analytics recently warned of the heightened risk of corporate defaults in the oil and gas sector across the globe, and weakness in entertainment and leisure giving way to pressure on consumer durables. “The willingness to fight deflation should bode well for bitcoin,” said Richard Rosenblum, head of trading at GSR. Meanwhile, Ashish Singhal, CEO and founder of the cryptocurrency exchange Coinswitch.co, said, “In a deflationary scenario, the chances of negative interest rates are high, and users would want to move their existing assets into more stable assets like bitcoin to prevent loss in their asset value.”Interest rates are already set below zero across Europe and in Japan and are hovering at or near zero in other advanced countries. Further, with central banks willing to do whatever it takes to defeat deflation, the real yield or inflation-adjusted returns on bonds are likely to remain negative or meagerly positive at best. As a result, zero-yielding assets like gold and bitcoin may attract more buyers. Bank of America’s analysts noted earlier this week that the stimulus frenzy amid the coronavirus pandemic would put pressure on the currencies and send gold to $3,000 by October 2021.While bitcoin could perform well during deflation, bitcoin and cryptocurrencies have seldom tracked macro developments on a consistent basis in the past. “Blockchain-based currencies are really their own beasts,” said Bitcoin Depot CEO Brandon Mitz.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

You can subscribe here.And with the Bitcoin blockchain's once-every-four-years rewards halving now just two weeks away, some analysts are starting to fix their sights on the next upside target: $10,000. “Look for prices to attempt the $10,000 level on speculative buzz leading into the halving,” Jehan Chu, co-founder and managing partner at Hong Kong-based blockchain investment and trading firm Keneti Capital, told CoinDesk.""A break above $10,000 would be significant from both a psychological and a technical standpoint,"" the research firm Delphi Digital wrote Monday in a note. ""With everything going on right now, it could also just bust through the top and zoom toward the next point of resistance, possibly near $10,000,"" Mati Greenspan, founder of Quantum Economics, told clients.The emerging price target represents a 29-percent increase from current levels, but bitcoin had traded as high as $10,500 in February prior to the coronavirus sell-off. According to Delphi Digital, any price rise could gather steam if bitcoin crosses above its 100-day and 200-day moving averages, now around $8,000. Bitcoin's third halving since its launch in 2009 is two weeks away: According to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Block Reward Halving Countdown clock, it's estimated to take place on May 12.  Investors continue to debate whether the halving will actually spur a big rally in bitcoin's price, or if the event is already baked into the market, merely an overhyped narrative pushed by bulls. One analysis published Monday on Medium by a poster under the name ""PlanB"" predicted that bitcoin's price could increase 37-fold to $288,000 by 2024, citing an increasingly cited metric known as the ""stock-to-flow model."" Before the coronavirus hit, the halving was supposed to be bitcoin's biggest calendar item of 2020. Now, traders are scrambling to adjust their forecasts to square the deflationary impact of the global recession with the potentially inflationary impact of trillions of dollars of Federal Reserve money injections. Bitcoin is seen by many cryptocurrency investors as a hedge against inflation.  This week, the Fed's monetary policy committee will hold its first regularly scheduled two-day meeting since the pandemic sent global markets reeling, and Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday is expected to update investors on the outcome of the closed-door discussions. According to German lender Deutsche Bank, the U.S. central bank could start looking for ways to stimulate an economic recovery – pivoting past the emergency actions taken in recent months to keep markets from collapsing. Joshua Frank, CEO of The Tie, a provider of data on digital assets, told CoinDesk this month that any price impact from the halving might look puny compared with the massive economic upheaval and government response.  The Congressional Budget Office projected Friday the U.S. federal budget deficit will reach $3.7 trillion in fiscal 2020 – nearly four times the $1 trillion gap estimated as recently as March. Such an imbalance would boost U.S. debt, as a percentage of gross domestic product, to 101 percent. Six years ago, the CBO predicted the ratio would reach 100 percent somewhere around 2039. In other words, the milestone is on track to arrive some two decades early. ""At some point, investors would begin to doubt the government’s willingness or ability to pay its debt obligations,"" the CBO wrote in a July 2014 post.Better add that to bitcoin's 2020 calendar. ""The perfect macro storm is now upon us, one about which many crypto investors have dreamt about since entering this asset class,"" Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer for cryptocurrency fund firm Arca, wrote Monday. The halving is imminent, though, so it's taking center stage.Kraken, a San Francisco-based cryptocurrency exchange, announced Monday it would host an Ask Us Anything session about the halving, featuring Business Development Director Dan Held and Bitcoin Strategist Pierre Rochard, moderated by Pete Rizzo, the exchange's editor-at-large.    The session will offer ""tips for translating tough bitcoin concepts to friends and family,"" according to a post on Kraken's website. Those might include a delicate explanation of how bitcoin might benefit from a global pandemic and the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. Trend: Bitcoin's ascent looks to have paused amid mixed action in the global equity markets and a renewed sell-off in oil. The top cryptocurrency is trading near $7,760 at press time, having failed twice in the last 24 hours to post sustainable gains above $7,800. Prices have risen by nearly $1,000 in the last seven days, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index. Most analysts expect bitcoin to rise well above $8,000 in the short term on the speculative buzz leading into the halving – the supply cutting event due on May 12. However, further gains may not be seen immediately if the latest oil price slide destabilizes the traditional markets. The front-month June futures contract on West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude is down over 18 percent at $10.40 per barrel at press time. The sell-off gathered steam Monday after the United States Oil Fund LP, the biggest oil exchange-traded fund, said it is planning to take out all funds invested in the June WTI contract.The oil price slide looks to have applied the brakes to the global equity market rally, which had picked up the pace on the Bank of Japan's unlimited stimulus plan. Asian stocks lacked consensus early on Monday, as indices in Japan, Australia and China suffered moderate losses, while shares in South Korea and Hong Kong eked out gains. While major European indices are currently reporting moderate gains, futures tied to the S&P 500 indicate the index is likely to open on a flat note, having rallied by 1.4 percent on Monday. If equities turn risk averse, tracking the decline in oil, buying interest around bitcoin could weaken, allowing a daily price drop for the first time in over a week. A bearish divergence of the four-hour chart relative strength index favors a price pullback to support at $7,500. But any losses could be short-lived because dip demand is likely to be strong, courtesy of the bullish narrative surrounding the halving. Notable long-duration indicators are also beginning to roll over in favor of the bulls. For instance, the weekly Chaikin money flow indicator, which takes into account both volumes and prices, has crossed above zero, indicating a bullish reversal.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The product complements a recent bitcoin inverse exchange-traded product (ETP) released by Amun in January and now overseen by sister firm 21Shares following a March rebranding.""Typically, these purchases are short term in nature, usually on a daily basis, as the holder aims to move in quickly to leverage a near-term decline in bitcoin to make a positive return,"" the firm said in an announcement.Designed as a stablecoin, BTCS is built on Ethereum's ERC-20 token standard, meaning it's as easy to purchase as any other token and will be available on secondary markets beginning with Liquid, HitBTC and Bitcoin.com, Hany Rashwan, CEO of Amun and 21Shares, told CoinDesk in an interview. ""Demand for these leverage and inverse tokens is tremendous,"" Rashwan said. ""The users want the ability to buy these kinds of products in an easier and safer way.""Rashwan said BTCS was purpose-built for traders of all stripes: retail to institutional. Moreover, the token was released before the May 11 bitcoin halving in order for traders to hedge against potential volatility, Amun said.Read more: Bitcoin Halving, ExplainedThe token was designed under the practices and standards developed by 21Shares, Rashwan said. The firm currently lists 11 ETPs on multiple European stock exchanges including the SIX Swiss. For compliance reasons, minting and burning BTCS is conducted on the Amun platform in exchange for the dollar-backed stablecoin USDC and remains off-limits to U.S. and Swiss investors, along with internationally sanctioned nations.Rashwan said Amun will roll out similar inverse tokens, including one for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, ether (ETH), in the coming weeks.With BTCS, the firm is primarily catering to the risk-averse side of the crypto market, investors who would rather trade regulation-compliant products, Rashwan said.""Regulations are important and it is just astounding to me how that's now a contrarian opinion,"" he said.Alternative derivatives markets such as BitMEX, Binance and FTX often stand on the other side of the moat. For example, BitMEX and FTX operate out of the lightly regulated Seychelles and Antigua and Barbuda, respectively, while Binance CEO Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao frequently reminds his Twitter followers of his firm’s decentralized work environment and is somewhat hazy on where the company is based.Either way, new products are chasing the money flowing into crypto derivatives platforms, which Rashwan said would likely overtake spot cryptocurrency trading in the near future. One new product that perhaps best highlights this innovation would be FTX's (i)BVOL financial instrument, which made its debut late last month.(i)BVOL comes in both a long and an inverse form – hence the (i) – and generally ""tracks market implied volatility,"" FTX and Alameda Research CEO Sam Bankman-Fried said in an email.Like the BTCS token, the (i)BVOL token is built on the ERC-20 standard and a separate in-house contract called MOVE that gives ""traders the ability to buy and sell bitcoin volatility over different time periods on margin,"" Bankman-Fried said. Notably, these tokens free traders from margin maintenance, known to be a sticky issue in crypto derivatives trading. FTX and Amun's tokens perhaps suggest ERC-20-based, wrapped derivatives are a good solution for retail users who can struggle with complex derivatives products. Rashwan pointed to the March delisting of a different set of FTX tokens from Binance's derivatives platform as a salient example for Amun. As CoinDesk reported, Binance's CZ removed the BULL and BEAR leverage tokens from his platform, arguing that ""users don't understand"" the products and were therefore taking unrealized losses.See also: CFTC Approves Bitnomial to Offer Futures Contracts Settled in Real BitcoinFor Rashwan, simplicity sells. ""I'm financially quite literate and it's not always clear what I'm buying with these products. If you are buying the actual futures, then you have to handle your own margin and the collateral and worry about liquidations,"" he said. ""It's a whole slew of things if all you want to do is just bet on the price going up or the price is going down.""The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Or it could be a simple coincidence, the product of block time variability. Read more: Bitcoin Halving, ExplainedThe event coincides with a six-month high in the aggregate size of unconfirmed transactions in bitcoin’s mempool. Bitcoin transactions are sent to the mempool, which serves as a sort of holding depot, after they have been verified by other non-mining nodes in the network. Miners then take transactions from the mempool and insert them into new blocks, which are then added to the Bitcoin blockchain. Bitcoin’s mempool soared to 77.58 million bytes worth of unconfirmed transactions on Thursday, according to Blockchain.com. The high number of unconfirmed transactions coinciding with such rapid block production is curious given that the job of bitcoin miners is to insert unconfirmed transactions in new blocks.With bitcoin’s third halving less than two weeks away, Friday’s spree of new blocks could signal a significant upcoming mining difficult adjustment amidst a surge in mining power.

Should bitcoin's price and mining difficulty remain constant, older generation mining models like the S9s could remain marginally profitable at these utility rates even after the halving takes the daily number of newly mined bitcoin down from 1,800 to 900 units. Meanwhile, major manufacturers' flagship machines including Bitmain's AntMiner S17 and S19 series as well as MicroBT's WhatsMiner M20 and M30 series can bring returns of over 60%, even at an average 5 cents per kWh utility cost.""Today's price movement would bring back even those miners that were recently disconnected due to profitability concerns,"" said Dmitrii Ushakov, chief commercial officer of Russia-based miner hosting firm BitRiver. ""After halving, we believe that the price range of 3 to 4 cents [USD] is sufficient to continue mining profitably with S9 miners if the current price movement continues.""Read also: Bitcoin Halving, ExplainedFollowing bitcoin's price crash on March 12, its worst sell-off in seven years, a wide range of older mining rigs have been forced to unplug from the network, resulting in a 16% mining competition drop in late March.The mining competition drop, together with bitcoin's price rebound after March 12, initially helped older miners become marginally profitable. As a result, Bitcoin's total hash rate climbed to a near all-time-high of 110 exahashes per second (EH/s) over the past several weeks.But during the same period, bitcoin's price stagnated around $7,000 for weeks, which put pressure on farms relying on older models ahead of the halving and cooled the purchasing spree for more powerful and top-of-the-line equipment at large scales.  That said, bitcoin mining is a dynamically changing game. As bitcoin's halving approaches in under two weeks, those relying on older mining equipment, without access to cheap electricity resources, face being squeezed out by those running efficient operations. Read also: Price Drop Casts Pall Over Bitcoin Miners’ Equipment UpgradesMining farm operators previously estimated that older models like the S9 accounted for around 20% of the bitcoin network's total computing power in March, which is a significant drop from a year ago because major players have been replacing these older models with more powerful new equipment during late 2019.

At the time of publication, 0.1 BTC is worth $770.  These addresses began to increase exponentially around mid-February, coinciding with Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s suggestion to lawmakers that the central bank lacked sufficient firepower to fight the next recession.  Inferring definite conclusions about market activity from on-chain metrics is difficult. A user can control multiple addresses, for example, so not every new address represents a new investor. Also, the number of bitcoin wallets with at least 0.1 BTC has grown gradually but consistently after dipping significantly during early 2018, according to Glassnode.

Coinbase is the largest U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange by traded volume, according to data aggregator CoinGecko.When Armstrong tweeted the Coinbase customer data, $1,200 was worth roughly 0.17 BTC. “I’m not surprised at the increase in small purchases of bitcoin over the past few months,” said Anil Lulla, a former associate at Deutsche Bank and co-founder of Delphi Digital, a digital asset research firm. “It’s important to note, some of these people wrote off bitcoin in the past and have started to be intrigued, given the macro backdrop.”The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

emerging markets are more likely to see revolutionary bitcoin usage, ...","May 4, 2020 at 11:00 UTC","In advance of her “Crypto Across Emerging Markets” panel at Consensus: Distributed, Leigh Cuen is writing a three-part column on how cryptocurrencies are used in the developing world. In this first part of the series, she looks at the Middle East.","It is a truth universally acknowledged by pundits on Crypto Twitter that emerging markets are more likely to see revolutionary bitcoin usage, at least in the near future, than Silicon Valley. However, the term “emerging markets” encompasses most of the planet, excluding a handful of wealthy nations. For instance, even if fiat-denominated volumes are dwarfed by Asian whales or U.S. institutions, scrappy crypto traders in Turkey have a disproportionate impact on the global bitcoin economy. Register: Leigh Cuen Hosts “Crypto Across Emerging Markets” on May 11 at Consensus: DistributedGenerally speaking, regions with weak states and educated diasporas see more grassroots adoption. For example, Lebanese entrepreneur Michel Haber said most of the 26 remote workers involved with his web services startup, cNepho Global, now prefer bitcoin paychecks. Haber has already been paying some developers this way – with bitcoin from Beirut's grassroots trading networks – for two years. Now that most workers would rather receive bitcoin, he encourages colleagues to get mobile wallets.This is no longer a fringe outlook.The Arab Weekly ran a column in April about how the collapsed banking system is destabilizing Lebanon. Protests surrounded the central bank in April, and protests around bank branches even turned deadly. The situation continues to simmer.“The peer-to-peer bitcoin market is very robust because the Lebanese banking system has failed and people have more cash than the banks do,” Haber said. “Because of coronavirus, you can't really wait at the bank anymore. … They're not sure the Lebanese bank will actually give them the money.”This doesn’t mean bitcoin will easily replace local currencies, however. As witnessed in Iran, once home to a thriving bitcoin mining industry and retail usage, authorities curtailed usability once mainstream adoption grew. Read more: Iranian Bitcoiners Risk Fines, Jail Time as Government Regulates MiningBut rather than stamp out demand for cryptocurrency, crackdowns may merely change its manifestation. Some people now use bitcoin for savings and altcoins for transactional alternatives. Markets in places like Iran and Argentina now see increasing demand for stablecoins. Likewise, Argentinian crypto exchange founder Federico Ogue, CEO of Buenbit and Buendolar, said many users who are buying cryptocurrency for the first time are attracted to dollar-denominated stablecoins. In regions with volatile currencies and scant access to dollars, demand for stablecoins is up.According to a bitcoin trader in Iran, who asked to remain anonymous for safety, plummeting oil prices haven’t increased local demand for bitcoin. This is partially due to government efforts to promote the local stock market. Yet, as the dollar exchange rate fluctuates and paper bills become scarce, Tether stablecoins (USDT) sell for more than a dollar’s worth of Iranian rials.“The government is trying to push financial market demands into Tehran stock exchange to avoid increasing demands in currency or gold markets,” the anonymous Iranian trader said. “Local [crypto] exchanges changed [USDT] rates artificially to get more profit, also demand was so high compared to the low supply of USDT in peer-to-peer exchanges.”The most desirable aspect of the stablecoin isn’t any stability mechanism or collateral, it’s simply the network effects. After all, the reason many of these users turn to cryptocurrency is because they want a global asset, regardless of whether that takes the form of paper bills or software. CoinDesk senior reporter Leigh Cuen hosts the “Crypto Across Emerging Markets” panel on May 11 at 7:30 p.m. ET at Consensus: Distributed, CoinDesk's first virtual, free conference. Register here.The Middle East is also one of the few regions where decentralized applications (dapps) that aren’t focused on gambling are still attracting routine users.Dmail founder Mohamed Abdou, whose Egyptian team built a privacy-centric email service using Blockstack, said the dapp now has 15,000 active monthly users. As such, Dmail raised a $500,000 seed round in April, an amount which goes much further in Cairo than Silicon Valley.Read more: Encrypted Email Service Launches on Blockstack With Bitcoin Features“Users will be able to exchange emails, do text chat, voice calls, video calls, invoices and collect fees in crypto,” Abdou said of Dmail’s 2020 roadmap. Although Dmail doesn’t collect user information (and therefore doesn’t know where users are based), this Egyptian project was inspired by a local context where remittances and international payments offer a lifeline to an economy battered by depleted foreign currency reserves. The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

every day. Since miners need to sell part of their hard-won new bitcoins 
to ...","May 4, 2020 at 02:00 UTC","Economic growth figures are starting to trickle in and, as expected, they’re bad. Really bad. This past week the U.S. reported Q1 GDP growth as -4.8%. Italy’s GDP fell -4.5%, Spain came in at -5.2% and France trumped that with a whopping -5.8%.  And that’s just warming up – Christine Lagarde, head of the ECB, has warned euro-area GDP could fall by as much as 15% in Q2. ","And yet stock markets in the U.S. and Europe closed up on the week, in spite of the inevitability the next quarter will be worse still.You're reading Crypto Long & Short, a newsletter that looks closely at the forces driving cryptocurrency markets. Authored by CoinDesk's head of research, Noelle Acheson, it goes out every Sunday and offers a recap of the week – with insights and analysis – from a professional investor's point of view. You can subscribe here.This could be partly due to the concentration of market capitalization – nearly 25% of the S&P 500 market capitalization is from five tech companies, which arguably will do relatively well from more people staying at and working from home. Or, it could be because the stock market has broken all ties with the actual economy. The aforementioned concentration of the S&P 500 is intensifying, fueled by the dominance of passive investing, which means its performance does not reflect that of most of its constituents. And the “moral hazard” posed by the government’s willingness to bail out companies in difficulty suspends the need to scrutinize balance sheets and evaluate viability. But reality doesn’t stay suspended forever, no matter how much we wish it would. Eventually the abrupt slowdown of economic activity will feed through to numbers investors can’t ignore, and the current price/earnings (P/E) valuations will start to look absurd.  This is where bitcoin comes in. Its underlying technology and monetary system make it one of the few investable assets that is immune to the economic fluctuations we have ahead.First, its P/E ratios will never look absurd because it doesn’t have any earnings. Nothing to get hit there.Second, its use will not be curtailed by lack of customer mobility – users can transact from anywhere. In fact, logistical constraints could boost interest in bitcoin transactions from those who normally hand over physical cash (although why they would want to if people aren’t moving around is another question). Third, its market valuation is not susceptible to artificial support from governments trying to keep investor (and voter) spirits up. This does not mean bitcoin’s price will keep going up while other prices come down. We saw back in March that when things get bad in markets, bitcoin also suffers. Its price is driven by sentiment.But it is also driven by expectations of future adoption and demand, which are unrelated to the drivers of demand for most other investable assets. In terms of fundamentals, bitcoin has nothing to lose in the upcoming crisis – no income, no debt and its future adoption does not depend on happy and confident consumers. Just the opposite, in fact.The growing awareness of this, combined with heightened media attention due to the upcoming halving, could be one of the reasons behind this week’s recovery. Or perhaps it is being swept along in the wave of inexplicable optimism in traditional markets. Should that turn south, bitcoin is likely to suffer in the sentiment-driven short term. Longer term, however, fundamentals tend to surface, and those that drive bitcoin are radically different from those that drive traditional markets.Talk about marching to your own beat.  One argument in favor of the bitcoin price rallying after the halving is that of supply and demand. Assuming demand is more or less constant (I know, but work with me here), when supply drops the price should go up. Basic economics – you remember that graph from high school, right? After the halving, there will be fewer new bitcoin entering the market every day. Since miners need to sell part of their hard-won new bitcoins to meet expenses, some of the sell pressure comes from miners. If they are selling fewer bitcoins (because they have fewer bitcoins to sell), then there is less supply meeting a constant demand and the equilibrium price moves up.Fine, but one part of this model is already obviously unstable – demand is not constant, not by a long stretch.Even so, there is another overlooked weakness: The dent in sell pressure is negligible. Post-halving, there will be 6.25 fewer new bitcoins entering circulation with every block. Assuming a new block every 10 minutes, that translates to approximately 900 fewer new bitcoins a day.Considering the number of bitcoins transferred on-chain in April was an average of over 270,000 per day, 900 less won’t make much of a difference to the supply curve in that simple basic price equilibrium graph.  Any positive halving impact is more likely to come from increased awareness and trader interest resulting from the media attention. The juxtaposition of what is becoming known as a “quantitative hardening” against a “quantitative easing,” combined with growing unease about the latter, is likely to transform this media-fueled attention into a lasting interest from investors, analysts and economists. What is unclear is whether any price momentum from the halving would be enough to offset a hit to general sentiment from broader macro concern. As always in investing, one’s individual time horizon is everything. In spite of a stream of bad news on employment, production and earnings, the S&P 500 had its strongest April since 1987, possibly floating on the stimulus laughing gas. European indices also had a good month, as economies started announcing tentative steps towards opening up their economies and electricity consumption started edging up.  As April turned into May, markets started to retreat, perhaps digesting the recent gains and perhaps unnerved by a new anti-China belligerence from the U.S. and earnings warnings from tech companies. Gold continues to play the inflation game but with less enthusiasm and some profit taking – it remains to be seen how it would perform if stocks head south again. And West Texas oil had its first positive week in about a month as confidence gathered around the production cuts, although there could well be more turmoil there as the next futures expiries approach.  As you can see in the chart above, bitcoin had a particularly strong month. The jump this week gave bitcoin its best April in years, with data suggesting this rally is largely fueled by U.S. investors, with growth more in spot volumes than derivatives.  And a lack of foreign reserves has pushed countries such as Lebanon and Turkey towards currency crises, which remind us that a strong dollar impacts much more than just FX markets. What’s happening in Lebanon, where anti-government protests have turned violent and triggered the closure of the capital’s banks, will become a textbook example of the risks of centralized finance for years to come. (Note: Nothing in this newsletter is investment advice. The author owns small amounts of bitcoin and ether.)CoinDesk Research has published its first in a series of deep dives into listed crypto companies. We’re starting with Hut 8, one of the largest listed bitcoin miners, and its financials and recent operational shifts reveal some of the hurdles bitcoin miners struggle with in capitalizing their business while maintaining margins. Preston Pysh looks at investment opportunities in a market increasingly manipulated by government printing, predicting that a “break” will be triggered either by social unrest or a natural transition to a different form of money. TAKEAWAY: Preston is not a crypto enthusiast (among other things, he hosts the podcast “We Study Billionaires”), but he is bullish on bitcoin largely as an alternative to an increasingly debased dollar – this makes his take particularly interesting for those managing diversified portfolios, which should be everyone. How many of a project’s contributors have to be hit by a bus for the project to stall? Introducing the “bus factor,” a new metric that measures resilience. Really. TAKEAWAY: Actually, it’s a cool concept, intriguingly expanded on here by analyst Hasu. The higher the bus factor (the more widely distributed the code development), the easier a network is to replicate. The lower the bus factor (the more concentrated its control), the greater the risk. A couple of years ago Twitter woke up to a mercifully false rumor that Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin had been killed in a car accident. (It didn’t involve a bus as far as I know.) The news pushed ether’s price down 15%. These days the impact would probably be different (although please be careful, Vitalik), but the anecdote shows that this is a metric worth watching.The city of Ya'an, in China's mountainous Sichuan province, is publicly encouraging the blockchain industry to help consume excessive hydroelectricity ahead of the summer rainy season. TAKEAWAY: This highlights how excess energy from hydroelectric and natural gas plants can bring down operating costs for miners, making their sector – crucial to the maintenance of the bitcoin network – more profitable and less vulnerable to price swings and halvings. Bitcoin futures and bitcoin options both had their most active day since the crash on March 12, according to derivatives data provider skew.com. TAKEAWAY: To be honest, I’m not sure what this means, but it feels significant. Coin Metrics presents “free float supply,” which adjusts supply measurement by taking out founding tokens and vested tokens, as well as those that are inactive, burned or probably lost. TAKEAWAY: The result is a measure of circulating tokens, a more reliable gauge of a network’s size and liquidity. Bitcoin’s free float supply, according to Coin Metrics, is over 4 million less (over 20% less) than the reported figure, which implies that its velocity (the transaction rate compared to the amount outstanding) is higher than many have calculated. Blockchain analytics firm Glassnode has introduced a new metric called Glassnode On-Chain BTC Index (GNI), which aims to link price performance to network fundamentals. TAKEAWAY: Any fundamentals-tracking index is subjective, no matter how much rigor goes into selecting and quantifying the components. However, as long as the methodology is consistent, they can provide valuable information about trends and shifts, and at first glance the GNI does a good job of taking into account the principal value drivers of sentiment, liquidity and network health. The index recently turned from bearish to neutral, which is itself a bullish sign. Large crypto investors, popularly known as “whales,” seem to be accumulating bitcoin amid the ongoing price rally. TAKEAWAY: Although an imperfect indicator, this can be interpreted as bullish, as high-net worth individuals or funds appear to be adding to or taking new long positions in bitcoin, perhaps in response to the monetary turmoil in the fiat world. Genesis Capital* released its Q1 lending report, which highlights more than $2 billion of new loan originations, twice the figure for the previous quarter. This brings their cumulative amount lent to $6.2 billion. TAKEAWAY: Those are substantial figures, which point to a deepening maturation of the space. The report is worth a read, especially as it gives insight into the timeline around the March 12 crash, and how Genesis handled the turmoil. It also confirms that the lender has tightened credit, given the market uncertainty. This is likely to be temporary and comes as a relief – the sector needs strong lenders, as leverage can fuel growth but can also bring it tumbling down if it has to unwind suddenly. (*Genesis Capital is owned by CoinDesk's parent company, DCG.)Leigh Cuen spoke to several crypto custody and wallet providers about the uptick in activity they have seen since the beginning of the lockdown. TAKEAWAY: Growing interest in off-exchange custody solutions implies a growing interest in holding crypto assets, rather than just trading them. Some of the exchanges Leigh spoke to cater mainly to institutional clients, but others have a wider base, which implies that interest in bitcoin is spreading amongst all types of investors. The second fund of a16z’s crypto division has raised $515 million, more than the original target of $450 million and considerably more than the $300 million raised by the first fund, which launched in 2018. The investments will focus on next-generation payments, decentralized finance, new monetization models and the concept of a decentralized internet. TAKEAWAY: While this is a crypto venture fund, investing in startup equity and tokens without the intention to trade, this raise is bullish for the sector as it implies a belief that at least some of the beneficiary blockchain companies will have viable businesses. Silvergate Bank added 46 crypto customers in the first quarter, bringing the total to 850, largely institutional investors. The number of transactions more than doubled in Q1 vs Q4, and was up more than 3x vs the same period in 2019. TAKEAWAY: One intriguing disclosure in the report was the mention of a lending service called SEN Leverage, currently in pilot mode, which will allow bank customers to obtain U.S. dollar loans collateralized by bitcoin. Crypto as collateral is a fascinating area to watch. On the one hand, the bearer status of bitcoin, its relative liquidity and its ease of transfer make it an ideal collateral from a lender’s point of view. On the other hand, current legislation makes it very difficult in practice. This paper by Xavier Foccroulle Menard, posted on SSRN this week, gives a great explanation as to why. (TL;DR: it’s to do with UCC definitions of collateral – guess what, bitcoin doesn’t fit.)Hangzhou-based Ebang International Holdings, one of the leading manufacturers of bitcoin mining equipment, has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for an initial public offering of up to $100 million. TAKEAWAY: There does seem to be a trend amongst Chinese companies of trying to list in the U.S., in a bid to broaden their geographical diversification. Curiously, this could encourage the shift of the epicenter of bitcoin mining away from China and towards the U.S. CFTC commissioner Brian Quintenz, one of the organization’s crypto supporters and who advocated for self regulation in the crypto industry, will not seek renomination when his post ends this month, and will leave the regulatory organization by late October. TAKEAWAY: SEC commissioner Hester Peirce, who has argued in favor of bitcoin exchange-traded funds and also favors a more supportive approach to innovation, is also nearing the end of her term. As far as I know, her plans have not been made clear yet, and we don’t know who will be replacing Quintenz – but this could mark a subtle change in tone at one of the most powerful securities regulators.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.The move upward may have been fueled by traders keying off market signals, according to Joe DiPasquale, CEO of cryptocurrency hedge fund BitBull Capital. Prices found a floor at the 50-day moving average around $6,800, breached a resistance level at $7,300 and now appear on track to push toward the 150-day moving average around $7,800, he wrote in an email to CoinDesk.""As is often the case, the line acted as a resistance level on the way up, and now that we're above it the line is currently being tested as a level of support,"" Mati Greenspan, founder of analysis firm Quantum Economics, wrote in an email to clients.  So where does that leave bitcoin? It's now at the highest price since March 11 – the day before the ""Black Thursday"" plunge, when bitcoin tumbled 39 percent amid a flight to cash across both digital and traditional financial markets, as the devastating economic toll of the coronavirus came into view.Bitcoin is now up 5.1 percent for the year to date, a performance that looks impressive compared with the 13 percent drop in the Standard & Poor's 500 Index. The cryptocurrency still trails gold, up 14 percent on the year. DiPasquale predicts that ""after some consolidation"" bitcoin prices could rise toward $9,000. From a fundamental perspective, bitcoin is now just a few weeks from its once-every-four-years ""halving,"" when the pace of issuance of new units of the cryptocurrency decreases by 50 percent. German bank BayernLB predicted last year bitcoin's halving could drive its price to $90,000, roughly 12 times the current level, but some traders say that the well-telegraphed event is already baked into market expectations. What's clear is governments and central banks around the world are pushing to pump additional fiscal and monetary stimulus into the global financial system. Cryptocurrency traders are tracking the money injections, which could eventually lead to inflation, since bitcoin is often seen as a hedge against inflation, similar to gold. Fitch Ratings said this week in a statement that an ""unparalleled global recession"" is underway, with global gross domestic product set to contract by 3.9 percent this year, the biggest drop in the post-war period. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told Fox Business on Wednesday that ""we need to spend what it takes to win the war"" against the coronavirus.The Federal Reserve, which is indirectly providing financing for government emergency programs, including through purchases of U.S. Treasury bonds, said late Thursday its total assets surged this week past $6.5 trillion for the first time in the central bank's 107-year history. That's an increase of more than $2 trillion in just six weeks. Yet, an analysis Thursday by The TIE, a research firm, showed some traders might be shifting their focus toward the halving. In tweets mentioning the word ""bitcoin,"" those that included the term ""halving"" surged by 63 percent on Thursday to 1,058. Bitcoin-related tweets mentioning gold slipped by 8.1 percent to 634. Cryptocurrency analysts have latched onto the contrast between the tightening supply of bitcoin and the Fed's loose monetary policy. ""The halving is now 18 days out, ensuring the increased scarcity in a world where money supply in other currencies is drastically increasing,"" Greenspan wrote. Trend: Bitcoin is a better bid on Friday amid signs of increased institutional adoption. At press time, bitcoin is priced around $7,530 on major exchanges, having breached the resistance of $7,468 (April 7 high) on Thursday. As prices broke above the key hurdle, open interest in futures listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) rose to $233 million, the highest since Feb. 26, according to data provided by crypto derivatives research firm Skew. Meanwhile, daily trading volume rose to $485 million to hit the highest level since March 12. ""The growth in open interest from CME may indicate that entities from traditional finance are more open to add bitcoin exposure to their portfolios, whilst retail investors are seemingly more reluctant to indulge in the futures market,"" said cryptocurrency platform Luno. An increase in open interest along with an increase in price is said to confirm an upward trend. So, bitcoin’s ongoing rally may have legs. Some observers put the rise down to a pre-halving price boost that could take prices well above $8,000. Bitcoin is set to undergo its third mining reward halving in May. Technical charts, too, suggest scope for stronger gains in the short term. For instance, a symmetrical triangle breakout seen on the daily chart indicates a resumption of the stalled rally from the March 23 low of $3,867. Bitcoin could soon challenge the 100-day average located at $8,024. A violation there would expose next price hurdle lined up at $8,213 (Jan. 24 high). The immediate bullish case would be invalidated if prices fall back below Thursday'slow of $7,031, although that looks unlikely, as the breakout is backed by an above-50 or bullish reading on the 14-day relative strength index.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Since then, open positions have risen by 228%. ""The uptick in the CME open interest is indicative of professional traders returning to the bitcoin market,"" noted analytics resource Arcane Research in its monthly report. CME open interest is widely considered to be a proxy for institutional activity. While that may be the case, retail investors, too, could be trading CME futures through TD Ameritrade, an online broker. Further, the latest open interest figure may have been distorted due to the rumored entry of Renaissance Technologies’ into CME futures trading. In March, the quantitative analysis-heavy firm gave the green light for its Medallion fund to trade the CME’s cash-settled bitcoin futures market.Some observers argue that only U.S.-regulated institutions are required to trade on the CME while the rest may be trading on other major exchanges like BitMEX. See also: BitMEX Is Making Bitcoin Network More Expensive for Everyone, Researcher FindsPut simply, the uptick in the CME open interest does not necessarily represent institutional activity, more so as the exchange accounts for a small portion of the global futures open interest. “It’s still small relative to the rest of the market and the overall market open interest is still quite low,” said Darius Sit, co-founder and managing director at Singapore-based QCP Capital.Total open interest in futures listed on major exchanges across the globe stood at over $2.5 billion on Tuesday, the highest level since March 11, when the tally was around $3.8 billion.

""From a research perspective, whether academic or industry research, this data can help better calibrate and adjust the parameters of researchers’ models.""Many miners use virtual private networks (VPNs) to mask IP addresses and can make locations harder to pin down. In the methodology page, CCAF said that they had noticed this was particularly prominent in Zhejiang province. ""To mitigate this effect, we have divided the hashrate of Zhejiang province proportionally among other Chinese provinces listed in the pool’s dataset,"" it reads. CCAF's mining map also shows Xinjiang as the Chinese province with the highest concentration of hashrate, conflicting with crypto asset manager CoinShares, which has placed the southern province Sichuan at the top in most of its bi-annual reports.  See also: Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Nears All-Time High in Final Adjustment Before HalvingThat may be because CCAF's dataset began in September 2019, at the start of Sichuan's dry season, when hydroelectric plants were running at lower capacities and aren't producing as much power. Blandin said the map may at least confirm some Chinese miners may actually migrate from Sichuan to Xinjiang after the rainy season. Now that the wet season has begun, the disparity between CCAF and CoinShares data could well close.

activity.","Apr 30, 2020 at 16:30 UTC","Thanks in part to the uncertainty of the coronavirus crisis and rising bitcoin prices, bitcoin wallet startups have seen a sudden uptick in activity. ","For example, over the past two months the Austin, Texas-based bitcoin startup Unchained Capital, with over $50 million in assets under management and $150 million worth of bitcoin transactions processed, garnered several dozen new institutional clients, representing hundreds of individuals. Will Cole, Unchained’s chief product officer, said the custody product Vault saw 340% growth in Q1 2020 as compared to the previous quarter. “We’ve seen a big uptick in the creation of Vaults,” Cole said. “An event like that [pandemic] makes people think about how they are storing their bitcoin.”Unchained is working on a wallet update with new privacy features. It allows users to sort UTXO (unspent transaction output) information, which makes it possible to reveal less information about oneself to an external recipient, even while using a public blockchain.Read more: Bitcoin Firms Report Uptick in Demand for Inheritance ServicesUnchained adviser Christopher Allen, founder of the not-for-profit benefit corporation Blockchain Commons, said the industry still doesn’t have clear terminology that distinguishes the Vault custody solution, where both Unchained and the client have keys to a multisig wallet versus wallets where only the user holds keys. Regardless, there appears to be increased interest in wallets where users hold keys, in some form.“Custody requires keys that are under your control or under collaborative custody with others. But it isn't self-sovereign if they can unilaterally block your recovery,” Allen said. “There are many other companies and teams involved who all desire to make multisig easier, more standard, and allow you to choose different approaches or implementations knowing that you are not locked into a single solution.”Such setups, like Vaults, make sense for companies and families that want to manage significant funds without a single person being in control of the wallet. These days many of the industry’s large wallet businesses appear to be growing, in terms of both profits and users.For more private options geared toward individual users, ShapeShift CEO Erik Voorhees said there are far more people using his software wallet solution this year. As such ShapeShift, acquired the Israeli wallet startup Portis for an undisclosed amount in April. This decreased the company’s compliance risks and solidified its position in the industry's self-custody sector, slightly less lucrative than custodial crypto exchanges yet growing at a comparable rate.“This is the first recession the world has seen since cryptocurrency existed,” Voorhees said. “We want people to think of ShapeShift as the self-custody interface for all the various crypto services out there.”Like ShapeShift, Ledger CEO Pascal Gauthier, whose startup is scaling up to meet increased demand for hardware wallets, said his wallet will also allow users to do “all the complex things you can do with a coin” directly through the Ledger Live app.Read more: Bitcoin Garners New Users as Governments Flood World With Fiat“We do see an increase in downloads of Ledger Live, our hardware wallet companion app, as we are adding more coins,” Gauthier said. “Nowadays, our main revenue comes from the hardware wallet business. … Our revenue model will evolve to one-off revenues, transactional and recurring revenues thanks to additional services.”After several years of operation, many incumbent crypto companies now feel pressure to deliver returns for investors. It’s unclear which business models will best suit the crypto economy. “Every day I think about acquisitions for a minute, then decide against it,” Gauthier said. “Ledger has enough money in the bank, a good business. …There’s a question about where this industry is going and what does that mean for the future.”Unchained Capital earns revenue from clients who pay for the multisig Vaults or loan services associated with its open source wallets. The startup relies on subscriptions from a small number of wealthy clients for profits, even if it also serves less-lucrative retail users. On the other hand, ShapeShift profits from in-app referrals to exchanges and other services.Voorhees said he acquired Portis because the startup’s tech allows for a familiar login, akin to Facebook Login, but where users need to actually remember their passwords.Read more: ShapeShift’s New Platform Aims to Make Crypto Self-Custody as Easy as CoinbaseStepping back, Portis was founded in 2018 and attracted the attention of legendary Israeli tech investor Eddy Shalev. The Block reported Portis nearly shut down in Q1 2020, since co-founder Itay Radotzki quit in January and eight employees were subsequently laid off. Portis co-founder Tom Teman said the venture capital climate changed dramatically in 2020, a sentiment echoed by veterans across the industry, that investors are increasingly demanding revenue from the start.(After publication of this article, Teman told CoinDesk that The Block had it wrong: only four staffers, including Radotzki, were let go, he said.)Yet, a former Portis competitor, Fortmatic CEO Sean Li, said his user-friendly login startup isn’t taking ShapeShift’s approach because he doesn’t “think any business should see themselves as a portal that owns everything in it.” As such his revenue model is business-to-business, rather than monetizing user activity. Li estimated nearly 5,000 developers now use Fortmatic for gateways to their various projects, so his early-stage startup is still on track to make more than $500,000 in revenue this year.“This prevents the next Facebook or Google situation where one account is associated with a lot of different applications, compromising user security and privacy,” Li said. On the other hand, Casa CEO Nick Neuman said his subscription-based startup saw an “influx of new clients” since the beginning of March, with a 50% increase in bitcoin secured with Casa wallets. Like Unchained Capital and other subscription startups above, Casa is primarily focused on bitcoin.“We’re definitely seeing increased demand for self-custody since the coronavirus crisis began,” Neuman said. And where there is demand, there is opportunity.

The upcoming rainy season brings excessive hydropower, making electricity cheap and mining more profitable ... all else equal.","This year, however, two key variables have changed, upending the calculus for operators of mining facilities and for miners themselves in the world’s hub for this activity. After recovering from March’s brutal selloff, bitcoin’s price has been stagnating around $7,000. As a result, mining farms that offer hosting services are struggling to find enough customers to fill capacity. Further, the standstill comes just before the network’s halving event, due in less than 20 days, which will put further pressure on revenues in the multibillion-dollar bitcoin mining industry.Read also: Bitcoin’s Halving, Explained.The situation presents a conundrum for miners: whether to buy new, more powerful equipment; and if not, when to switch off older models, and when to switch them on again. The winning move will depend on how things play out after the halving, which is far from certain. “If bitcoin’s price doesn’t go up post-halving, then who’s going to buy new equipment to fulfill this capacity?” said Huang Fangyu, co-founder of ValarHash, the company behind the mining pool 1THash, which owns facilities primarily for self-mining in Sichuan and sells cloud mining contracts.As they game out the scenarios, miners at least enjoy a glut of space to host their machines. Mining facilities in China’s water-abundant southwestern provinces during the summer are offering electricity prices for as much as 20 percent lower than what they did last year in order to attract investors, industry experts say. Research firm CoinShares estimated in a December report that China accounted for 65 percent of bitcoin’s global computing power and the southwestern Sichuan province alone accounted for over 50 percent of the network’s total.Huang said based on his observations, the average offer by facilities for hosting services now ranges between 0.2 to 0.22 yuan ($0.028 to $0.031) per kilowatt-hour (kWh). He estimates it could go below the lower end when the rainy season starts in May and June.Charles Chao Yu, chief operating officer at the mining pool F2Pool, also said this year’s offer is certainly in the neighborhood of $0.031 per kWh following last month’s price crash as mining farms have to lower their margin to compete for customers. For context, the average electricity cost last year in China’s mountainous Sichuan and Yunnan provinces was between 0.24 and 0.25 yuan, around $0.035 per kWh.A seemingly negligible difference of even just 0.01 yuan, or $0.0014, makes all the difference for bitcoin mining. For a site that runs a capacity of 100 megawatt-hour (mWh), that difference would mean a daily cost saving of $3,360 and over $100,000 per month.At a time when bitcoin mining’s block reward is about to drop from 12.5 units per block to 6.25 in less than 20 days, saving on electricity would be as important as using more efficient mining equipment.China-based mining pool Poolin recently conducted a survey to scope out mining farms with hydro-power resources in China’s southwest regions. Poolin’s co-founder Chris Zhu Fa said based on the firm’s calculation, there will be 3 to 5 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of capacity during the summer this year with about 1 GWh that he believes is reliable in terms of pricing and qualification. Huang estimates mining facilities in Sichuan overall have a capacity of about 4 GWh while Yunnan has about 2 GWh.Bitcoin mining’s total average computing power has recently climbed to 113 million terahashes per second (TH/s), a rebound following a 16 percent drop last month. Assuming all of this computing power comes from widely used machines in the market like the WhatsMiner M20S, which has an average efficiency of 50 watt per TH/s, the total network could be consuming around 6 gigawatt of electricity worldwide in an hour. (For context, that is roughly what 600 U.S. households consumed in 2018.)But if bitcoin’s price remains at its current level of $7,000 after halving, older mining equipment is expected to shut down, which would lead to decrease of the network’s hashing power, making it even harder for farms that need customers to fulfill their capacity.That said, bitcoin mining is a dynamic market and game theory comes into play. If bitcoin mining’s competition and total hashrate drop after the halving resulting from some operators shutting down older models, then those who stick around would be able to receive more mined coins, resulting in older models to come online again. “It would be normal to see bitcoin network’s hashrate drop to 60 to 70 million TH/s after halving,” said Liu Fei, who manages self-mining facilities at Chinese bitcoin startup Bixin, during a recent online panel hosted by Chinese crypto media ODaily.“But when the mining competition drops in June, with mining farms offering more electricity promotions and sourcing second hand equipment to fulfill their capacities, we may see the hashrate go back to 100-120 million TH/s again,” he said.But what’s underneath these dynamics is the fact that the buying spree for new unused and more powerful equipment has cooled down, which is different from the situation last year and also one factor that leads to mining farms’ challenges in on-boarding enough customers.For instance, at this time last year, bitcoin’s mining hashrate was not even 50 million TH/s. Bitcoin’s price, although lower than what is right now, was on an upward trend. These factors drove demand for new mining equipment to outstrip manufacturers’ supplies, boosting the network’s hashrate to 100 million TH/s by the end of December. Then came the coronavirus outbreak, and eventually the March market meltdown. “The March 12 sell-off also caused a lack of confidence among investors in purchasing new equipment at a large scale,” Liu said. “So it’s likely going to be a game for existing inventories during the entire summer season.”Valarhash’s Huang echoed that sentiment. “The hashrate after halving will drop to a point that older miners like the AntMiner S9 could become profitable again with electricity promotions by mining farms,” he said. “Then the hashrate will go up and some will have to turn off again. That will be a headache.”And the last month’s sell-off also forced liquidations by many miner operators who had pledged bitcoin for loans, leaving many short on cash at the moment, Huang said. Thus, at this point, investors are taking a step back to wait and see how the market will react after halving before they spend money on new equipment.But as mining facilities struggle to sign customers, others may see opportunities in the secondhand market as older mining equipment is being sold at unprecedentedly cheap prices.For instance, distributors on Alibaba.com are advertising used AntMiner S9s in the secondhand market for $20 to $80 per unit, depending on their conditions. At the height of the crypto market’s 2017 craze, a single unit of AntMiner S9 could cost over $3,000. “Now it’s like selling iron with mining chips as a giveaway,” Huang said. “But those that have the access to extremely cheap electricity during the summer could still accumulate such stocks to either make a quick buck in the summer or to fulfill unused electricity at mining facilities.”To be sure, at the bitcoin network’s current difficulty and price, the AntMiner S9 could still yield a gross margin of just under 50 percent at an electricity cost of $0.03 per kWh. If bitcoin’s price remains at the current level after halving, S9s could still be marginally profitable once mining competition declines. And the option is available for miner operators to lower the voltage for these older models in order to improve their profitability.“It all boils down to the price of bitcoin,” Huang said. “If it goes back to $10,000, problem solved. Almost every machine can go back running again.”The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Remember, this is a time when assets like U.S. equities are enduring unprecedented volatility. There would need to be a return to frothy markets and the comeback of marginal greed to see more institutional players wandering inside the crypto gates. See also: As This Crisis Worsens, Bitcoin Will Become a Safe Haven AgainYou might think macro developments such as profligate money printing would give bitcoin a reasonable investment thesis. But that is not manifesting, and for good reason. The ecosystem around bitcoin is limiting its own long-term prosperity. Topping the list of ailments is bitcoin volatility, which is artificially created by high-leverage.With the crypto options market becoming more entrenched over the past year, it’s possible to observe a pattern in bitcoin volatility. There hasn’t been a sustained meaningful premium of implied volatility (the market’s forecast of the likely movement of price), over realized volatility. Bitcoin’s implied volatility rarely dips below 50 percent. In fact, bitcoin enjoys a rather patterned ""vol of vol,"" whereby implied and realized volatility move almost rhythmically together, fluctuating between 40 percent and above a 200 percent ceiling.An asset like bitcoin that over the course of years sustains an implied volatility of over 50 percent is truly remarkable. For comparison, stocks with a sustained volatility of even 25 are often classified as high-beta (meaning they outperform the market when it’s going up but fall precipitously when it's going down). So what is it that plagues bitcoin to create such outsized moves? Well, the biggest problem is the extreme amount of leverage in crypto derivative markets. As they try to increase adoption, cryptocurrency derivative trading platforms deal with a very unique situation. Bitcoin holdings are heavily concentrated, with 95 percent of physical supply owned by a relatively small number of addresses. At the same time, a great many traders on these platforms have a very strong appetite for risk. That is the short story of why 100 times (100x) leverage is now commonplace in crypto markets. There is a need to cater to the demands for rapid “financialization” of concentrated holdings. Leverage at 100x margin is attractive (at least superficially) to an investor looking to reduce capital requirements while increasing exposure. Regulated exchanges offer approximately 3.5x leverage onshore. But an apple-to-apple comparison is misleading; on- and offshore markets are different.Firstly, many offshore crypto exchanges act not only as a trading venue, but also as clearer and custodian – a complete vertical integration orchestrated by a company registered on a small island somewhere. This is versus the siloed and “arms’-length” functions in more regulated environments. Ultimately, this puts a huge amount of responsibility, and tremendous power, in the hands of offshore exchanges.Unless and until exchanges take it upon themselves to fix this problem, bitcoin won’t mature from being a gyrating toy into an asset of real interest for traditional market players.To offer 100x leverage, typically accompanied with a 0.50 percent maintenance margin (the amount of equity an account must sustain to keep its current positions and orders), is antithetical to the pursuit of orderly cryptocurrency market functions. In fact, it is probably the single largest contributor to sustained volatility. Adding fuel to the fire is that most of these leveraged exchanges are not built to handle concentrated volume at scale during times of high stress. Queuing and server overloads have become all too common, ironically just when markets tend to explode in trading volume. This impedes traders from reducing their exposure, leaving them to the mercy of aggressive liquidation algorithms (when price points trigger automatic position closures), whose successes are fingerprinted on exchanges’ insurance funds. The insurance funds of crypto exchanges act both as an outward image of the exchange's success, but also as a measure of how aggressive and damaging their liquidation algorithms are to their trading community. That is because on almost every exchange, the insurance fund is capitalized from liquidation of traders' positions.On some exchanges, once an account breaches the maintenance margin threshold – the price at which the account is in violation of minimum margin requirements to sustain its open orders and positions – a limit order is placed at the bankruptcy price to liquidate the position. On other trading platforms, liquidations are done in batches, with a fee charged for each partially completed order. In this fashion, the trading position is liquidated slowly, and there is a chance that they could be ""pumped"" back to life if the market is to recover. In any instance, as a direct consequence of 100x leverage and small balances of equity, orderly executions have very tight windows within which to operate.  Stigmatic levels of volatility associated with bitcoin are not inevitable. They are man-made. A reduction of leverage would alleviate the stress on liquidation engines. What is often lost in the fascination with high leverage is that 100x leverage creates a situation where any maintenance margin threshold – which will have to be less than 1 percent, and is often 0.50 percent – will simply not leave enough room for liquidation algorithms to be effective.For this reason, it would be wise to reduce leverage broadly available across the ecosystem to stop this ridiculous volatility. Even 25x with a 2 percent maintenance margin supplemented with a more sophisticated liquidation engine would be more equitable to traders.There needs to be a concerted and deliberate effort to reduce leverage and increase maintenance margin by the largest venues.

Bitcoin's fall came as the price of oil, popularly known as ""black gold,"" tanked on oversupply fears. Notably, traders fled from the May futures contract on the West Texas Intermediate's (WTI) crude, the main oil benchmark for North America, sending prices below zero for the first time on record. The unprecedented sell-off has injected uncertainty into global financial markets. As a result, stocks dropped on Monday with the S&P 500 losing 1.8 percent of its value. The risk-off macro-environment has again strengthened bearish pressures for bitcoin. ""The downside in BTC is
more likely attributable to losses in the equities market, which may be
directly or indirectly affected by Crude prices, than the downward trend for
crude directly,"" said Matthew Dibb, co-founder of Stack. Read more: Negative Oil Prices Could Hurt Bitcoin Miners Who Use Flared GasBitcoin has largely moved in tandem with the stock markets, in particular the S&P 500 index, from the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic in the last week of February. The latest drop in bitcoin prices marks a failure by the bulls to keep gains above the widely tracked 100-week average at $7,054.Bitcoin closed last week above the 100-week average, having repeatedly failed to do so in the preceding four weeks. As a result, some observers were expecting the upward momentum to gather pace. That didn't happen, as noted.The failed breakout is accompanied by a negative reading on the weekly chart's money flow index – a sign that sellers have the upper hand right now. As a result, further losses toward $6,472 (April 16 low) could be seen. The bearish technical setup is accompanied by continued sell-off in equities and oil. While WTI's May futures contract, set to expire on Tuesday, has risen back above $1, the June contract is now facing increased selling pressure and is currently trading near $11.80, down 40 percent on the day. Analysts at Goldman Sachs have warned the plunge in black gold is symptomatic of unprecedented supplies. Put simply, oil is likely to continue taking a beating in the short term. Importantly, a cash crunch seems to be gripping the markets again, as is evident from the losses in traditional safe havens like gold, the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc – alongside a 0.5 percent uptick in the dollar index.""[Bitcoin] may go down to $6,400,"" Chris Thomas, head of digital assets at Swissquote Bank, told CoinDesk. However, some observers are optimistic about bitcoin's future prospects. ""The [miner reward] halving should help keep a bid to bitcoin in the coming months,"" Richard Rosenblum, co-head of trading at GSR, told CoinDesk.Read more: Remote Working Proves Unexpected Hero as Half of US Economy Shifts to Home OfficesRosenblum added bitcoin is a futuristic product that will ultimately benefit from the growing prevalence of technology in consumers' everyday lives. Meanwhile, Stack's CEO Matthew Dibb thinks bitcoin and other major digital assets have largely remained ""out of harm's way"" despite the oil crash. ""While BTC is slightly down on today’s markets, we are not seeing any significant correlation between the market and energy commodities,"" said Dibb, adding the cryptocurrency will remain bullish as long as prices are holding above $5,800.Supporting these arguments is the recent decline in the number of bitcoins held on exchanges, which suggests a shift to the long-term holding strategies.

Finds - CoinDesk",https://www.coindesk.com/bitmex-is-making-bitcoin-network-more-expensive-for-everyone-researcher-finds,"Every day, around mid-morning New York time, the average fee bitcoin users 
worldwide pay to send the cryptocurrency spikes for up to an hour ...","May 5, 2020 at 19:22 UTC","Every day, around mid-morning New York time, the average fee bitcoin users worldwide pay to send the cryptocurrency spikes for up to an hour, then returns to normal. A respected researcher thinks he’s found the reason: BitMEX.","If the crypto derivatives exchange used more efficient technologies when broadcasting transactions, users could save as much as roughly 1.7 bitcoin (worth more than $15,000 at press time) in fees every day, or about 7 percent of total daily fees paid, argues pseudonymous bitcoin engineer 0xb10c.""The daily broadcast has a significant impact on the Bitcoin network and user fees,"" 0xb10c wrote in a recent report. Nearly every time a user sends a bitcoin transaction, they tack on a (usually) small fee along with it. Fees fluctuate all the time, depending on how much congestion is in the network. That's because there is limited space for transactions to go through. If there are too many transactions sent at the same time, miners will prioritize ushering through those with higher fees. Those with smaller fees will have to wait.Read more: Bitcoin’s Crash Triggers Over $700M in Liquidations on BitMEXBecause BitMEX broadcasts thousands of transactions at once at the same time every day, it leads to a fee increase every day, 0xb10c contends.""Every day at around 13:08 UTC (9:08 a.m. ET), multiple megabytes of optimized transactions, mostly user withdrawals, are broadcast by BitMEX. The effect is immediately noticeable as a spike in the fee rates, which estimators recommend and users pay,"" 0xb10c told CoinDesk. His research indicates that this has been going on since at least September. BitMEX, which is based in Seychelles, argued that the startup has had other more pressing priorities.“Our starting point will always be the safety and security of our users’ trading experience. BitMEX has never lost funds due to a hack or any form of intrusion. We have a world-class security team and are committed to the continuous improvement of our systems and processes,"" a BitMEX spokesperson told CoinDesk.0xb10c has been writing a series of posts about insights he gleaned as he built the Bitcoin Transaction Monitor, a data tool for exploring transactions on the network in detail. Most bitcoin wallets have fee estimators built in that estimate what fee a user should add to a transaction to ensure it is accepted in a timely fashion. If the network is handling too many transactions at once and the fee is too small, it could take longer for the transaction to go through. Because of BitMEX's many transactions going on at once, clogging the blockchain, the estimators move the fee up and many users pay them.BitMEX broadcasts thousands of bitcoin transactions at once at the same time every day, leading to a fee increase every day.While users obviously prefer lower fees, higher fees strengthen the network’s security, especially when block rewards (miners’ main source of income right now) decrease every four years, 0xb10c added. The third halving of mining rewards is expected to take place next week and has only highlighted long-term worries about network security. That said, developers and other bitcoin enthusiasts have long been trying to push big exchanges and wallet providers (far beyond just BitMEX) to adopt scaling technologies that could cut fees and make the network run more efficiently. These include Segregated Witness, or SegWit, a scaling upgrade that became available in 2017.""It’s a bit strange to realize that fees would be close to 0 if exchanges used better practices. Their profligacy helps maintain the fee pressure,"" tweeted Nic Carter, co-founder of crypto data provider CoinMetrics, in response to 0xb10c’s research.BitMEX agreed on this point, saying that new upgrades are important for the health of the network and that implementing them is important to the company.""We recognize the importance of improving the efficiency of our interaction with the Bitcoin network and are working on implementing new systems, including SegWit. Looking more broadly, we are also donating to and partnering with selected developers and institutions to advance the software capability and future stability of the Bitcoin network. This will also help to reduce transaction fees,” the spokesperson said.Illustrating the problem, on March 12, the day bitcoin’s price crashed in tandem with the equity markets as the coronavirus pandemic shook the world’s economies, the usage of SegWit-updated nodes dropped 5%.Binance, the world’s largest exchange, saw outsized volume on March 11-12 – over $1 billion and $945 million respectively instead of the seven-day rolling average across January and February of $637 million, according to CryptoCompare – but hadn’t yet moved to SegWit wallets. Binance spokesperson Jessica Jung said the exchange has not updated to SegWit, “but it's in the pipeline.”Read more: BitMEX Restricts Access to Japanese Residents, Citing Changes to Local LawBeyond SegWit, 0xb10c recommended BitMEX use ""output batching,"" a years-old technique of cramming many transactions into one to save on transaction space. He also mentioned Schnorr/Taproot, a Bitcoin upgrade that's been in the pipeline for years that some developers estimate will finally be deployed over the next year.""By utilizing scaling techniques, some of which have been industry standards for multiple years, the impact could be reduced. BitMEX is stepping in the right direction by planning to switch to nested SegWit. They, however, shouldn’t stop there,"" 0xb10c wrote.William Foxley contributed reporting. UPDATE (May 9, 17:20 UTC): This article has been updated to include comments received from BitMEX after publication.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

On Thursday, prices for further-dated futures contracts on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) were higher than near-dated ones. The term structure, known as contango, is usually taken as a bullish signal. ","The world’s oldest cryptocurrency popped 10 percent Thursday ahead of April CME futures expiration, from $7,018 to as high as $7,765 on retail-friendly spot exchanges like Coinbase. The CME April contract settled at $7,115 on Thursday while those for May delivery came in $40 higher, indicating a positive outlook.“Leveraged demand is back with a vengeance today, with the futures term structure shifting back into contango, after a trigger of stops on the break of $7,500 sent bitcoin all the way to the $7,800 level,” said Denis Vinokourov, head of research for cryptocurrency brokerage and exchange Bequant. Earlier in the week, further-dated contracts were trading at a discount to the spot price, a situation known as “backwardation.” Contango returned Wednesday and for a short period of time Thursday, Kraken futures dated a month out were trading at a 7.3 percent premium on an annualized basis to spot on the Kraken exchange, according to data from Skew. Thursday's rally has some observers wondering if the crypto derivatives market, particularly BitMEX, continues to amplify drastic bitcoin price movements. During sudden price changes, automatic liquidations are triggered  on such exchanges as BitMEX, for those traders unlucky enough to bet the wrong way. Alex Mashinsky, CEO of crypto lender Celsius Network, wonders if bitcoin can maintain its gains. “The big question is will this hold or are we just seeing flash liquidations of shorts on BitMEX,” he noted to CoinDesk. Bitcoin’s price is only now approaching where it was just prior to its March 13 crash, when it changed hands as low as $3,867. “I’m happy for the pop. However, being bitcoin I’m not impressed - we are back at the April 9 level, nothing to see here,” said Henrik Kugelberg, a Sweden-based over-the-counter (OTC) trader.As bitcoin goes up, so do other crypto assets. Ether (ETH) climbed 3.7 percent in the past 24 hours of trading as of 21:10 UTC (5:10 p.m. EDT).Other digital assets were also in the green for the day. The biggest winners Thursday included stellar (XLM), up an eye-popping 18 percent, cardano (ADA) higher by 16 percent and ethereum classic (ETC) gaining 6 percent. All price changes are as of 21:10 UTC (5:10 p.m. EDT).Despite recent research towards the contrary, increases in stablecoin issuance are one signal to look towards for today’s bullish activity, says Blockfills’ Van Huis. “We’ve seen a massive increase in stablecoin activity, perhaps indicating fresh money coming into the market which eventually gets distributed into cryptos.”Oil is roaring back in a big way, jumping 19 percent in trading per barrel as of 21:10 UTC (5:10 p.m. EDT). This is after a historic week saw ‘black gold’ futures prices hit historic negative values Monday. As for real gold, the yellow metal gained 1 percent - trending downward a bit in Thursday afternoon trading but the safe haven remains in the $1,700 area it crossed Wednesday. In the United States, the S&P 500 index slipped less than a percent with U.S. Treasury yields relatively flat as a reported 4.4 million fresh jobless claims were reported this week. The FTSE Eurotop 100 index of largest companies in Europe was up less than a percent , even as economic data made available Thursday in the U.K. showed dismal numbers amid the coronavirus pandemic. As for the Asian markets, Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 index closed up 1.5 percent as sectors such as real estate and transportation rebounded from Wednesday losses. The Bank of Japan is expected to have a policy meeting on Monday with stimulus reportedly on the agenda, particularly bond repurchases. “Everything is up today - gold, equities, even bonds. It's a 'risk-on' day,” said Rupert Douglas, head of institutional sales at digital asset management firm Koine. “The question is whether when equities head south again, will bitcoin be correlated, like last time, or uncorrelated?” The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Senate's decision to approve $484 billion in new coronavirus relief.","Apr 22, 2020 at 12:09 UTC",Bitcoin is rising so far on Wednesday as stock markets cheer the U.S. Senate’s decision to approve $484 billion in new coronavirus relief. ,"The top cryptocurrency by market value is changing hands near $6,970 at press time, representing a 1.6 percent gain on the day. Prices look to have steadied in the $6,930 to $7,000 range over the last hour or so., according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index. Meanwhile, the Euro Stoxx 50 – the eurozone’s benchmark equity index – is reporting a 1 percent gain, and there's been a 1.26 percent increase in the value of futures tied to the S&P 500. The positive moves come after the U.S. Senate passed a new stimulus bill on Tuesday to bolster aid for small businesses, fund more coronavirus testing, and provide support to hospitals facing a deluge of sick patients. The new package comes nearly four weeks after the U.S. lawmakers approved an unprecedented $2 trillion federal stimulus program. This new bill now moves to the House of Representatives for approval before it can be signed by President Donald Trump.That the trillions of dollars of stimulus is inflationary and could bode well for bitcoin in the long term is generally accepted by now. So far, however, bitcoin has failed to perform as a significant haven asset or an inflation hedge, and has been generally tracking equities through the crisis.While the cryptocurrency has recovered over 80 percent from the March low of $3,867, the price rally has coincided with the notable recovery in the S&P 500. That said, signs of bitcoin decoupling from traditional markets have emerged this week.For instance, the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude, the main oil benchmark for North America, fell to $37 below zero on Monday, sending shockwaves across the global financial markets. Bitcoin wobbled slightly following the oil price slide and registered a 4 percent drop Monday. But the decline was moderate considering the scope of the oil losses and the stressed state of the global economy the event reflected. Further, bitcoin remained steady near $6,850 on Tuesday even though the June futures contract on the WTI fell by 40 percent and the S&P shed more than 3 percent of its value. More important, classic safe havens like gold and U.S. Treasurys also faced selling pressure on Tuesday, while the U.S. dollar strengthened in the forex markets – a sign of a renewed dash for cash. A similar cash crunch seen in mid-March triggered a violent price drop. Bitcoin fell by nearly 40 percent on March 12 and printed a low of $3,867 the following day as investors scrambled for liquidity. This time, however, the cryptocurrency is showing resilience, possibly because the crypto market focus has shifted to bitcoin’s mining reward halving in 19 days. “Last month’s rush to cash
hit bitcoin especially hard. This time around, the impending halving could have
mitigated outflows from crypto into cash,” said Marcus Swanpoel, CEO of
cryptocurrency exchange Luno. Bitcoin undergoes the halving process every four years, reducing block rewards by half in order to curb inflation.  See also: Bitcoin Halving, Explained Many observers expect the supply-cutting event to bode well for bitcoin’s price. These bullish expectations could force investors to hold their coins while heading into the event.“It could be that investors
are not choosing to sell their holdings as we might expect and instead are
staying in bitcoin so as not to miss out on the anticipated gains in the months
following the halving,” Simon Peters, an analyst at multi-asset investment form
eToro, told CoinDesk. It remains to be seen if bitcoin remains bid while heading into halving. Luno's Swanpoel thinks more money may come into cryptocurrencies if gold keeps drawing safe-haven bids. The yellow metal is reporting 2 percent gains at press time and may continue to draw bids, as a V-shaped economy recovery is increasingly looking unlikely. From a technical analysis standpoint, bitcoin’s immediate bias is neutral because the cryptocurrency is trapped in a sideways channel. As can be seen, bitcoin has been largely restricted to a range of $6,470 to $7,470 since April 7. However, within that range, the cryptocurrency printed a bearish lower high at $7,300 on April 18, raising the prospects of a downside move to $6,470. So far, however, the sellers have failed to penetrate the bottom of the range.The bulls need to keep bitcoin above the descending (bearish) 50-day average at $6,802 to avoid a sell-off.On the higher side, a move above $7,300 would strengthen the prospects of a range breakout and a rally to $8,000 ahead of halving.Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency at the time of writing.

We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.If bitcoin were a government-issued currency, it would be one of the world's top performers – beating not only popular emerging-market tenders like the Mexican peso and South Africa's rand, but also advanced-nation stalwarts like the euro, British pound and Canadian dollar. ""Bitcoin is behaving as a store of value much the same as king dollar is behaving as a store of value,"" Paul Brodsky, partner at cryptocurrency and blockchain investment firm Pantera Capital, said in a phone interview. Many cryptocurrency investors see bitcoin as a hedge against inflation, similar to gold. And many of those investors believe bitcoin will eventually benefit from the Fed's trillions of dollars of emergency money injections, which could spur inflation over the long term.But guess what bitcoiners can already cheer about? Beating the euro during a year that the International Monetary Fund predicts will see the world's worst recession at least since the 1930s.""What you would expect to see going forward are hard assets, like gold and bitcoin, outperform as fiat currencies get depreciated,"" said Greg Cipolaro, co-founder of cryptocurrency analysis firm Digital Asset Research. Think about it this way: Dollars have been in such high demand from investors, businesses, governments and central banks around the world that the Federal Reserve has had to inject more than $2 trillion of new money into financial markets just to preserve stability. There's no real comparison, of course, between the bitcoin market and the global market for dollars: The total outstanding value of all bitcoin ever created is currently around $130 billion, less than 1/100th of the $16 trillion U.S. money supply. But as an investment, bitcoin is beating most world currencies and breaking even with the dollar. One of the Fed's motivations for the massive money injections is, ultimately, just monetary policy: The U.S. central bank is trying to counteract the powerful deflationary forces of an economic contraction. Oil, which is priced in dollars, is now trading at about $14 a barrel, down from $61 at the start of the year, based on the benchmark U.S. futures contract. That's deflation – a classic economic reaction to falling demand.Bitcoin, by contrast, has held its value: One unit of the cryptocurrency now buys 507 barrels of oil, about five times what it could at the start of the year. Any currency's ultimate value is its purchasing power. And bitcoin is holding its own against the almighty dollar.   BTC: Price: $7,081 (BPI) | 24-Hr High: $7,186 | 24-Hr Low: $6,943Trend: Bitcoin is in the green again Thursday, after a small rally on light trading volumes.The top cryptocurrency is currently trading near $7,100, representing a 2 percent gain on the day. The cryptocurrency continues to show no real sign of breaking from the recent narrow range between $6,500 and $7,300.The MACD, an indicator used to judge momentum and change in trend, shows the potential for a move to the downside, courtesy of falling histogram bars hovering near the neutral 0 line.Should a loss at the 50-day moving average occur (yellow line on chart) – currently around $6,771 – a deeper drawdown shouldn't be ruled out. A likely area of support in such a case would be toward the bottom of the range at $6,520 – a level that has held steady since April 2.The relative strength index (RSI) is trending bullishly, however. Should the bulls defend the 50-day average and the RSI doesn't dip too far toward oversold, a bounce toward $7,300 is also plausible.For now, traders will have to wait and see which direction is offered, as the all-important daily average should provide greater clarity moving forward.It's worth remembering the miner reward halving is due in just 18 days, which has the potential to shake the market into action.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

With 10-day and 50-day technical indicator moving averages signaling tepid sentiment Tuesday, bitcoin is experiencing little trading action, staying at the $8,800 price range. At press time bitcoin (BTC) was trading up less than a percent over 24 hours at $8,945.The sideways action, also known as “consolidation,” is a pattern of predictable behavior during which traders like Jack Tan, founding partner at Taiwan-based crypto trading firm Kronos Research, seek various price levels in which to trade in and out. “We are still in a consolidation phase as the next level is $14,000, I believe,” said Tan. “I think $8,400-ish should hold on the daily chart. If not, then it invalidates the bullish thesis.” Read more: Bitcoin Briefly Hits $9K, Investors Remain BullishFor a crypto trader to call a range between $8,400 to $14,000 is a pretty wide guess and a sign volatility could be the name of the game for the next week or two. After a brief period in which the S&P 500 was more volatile than bitcoin, the latter regained its status as the rockier asset last week, though only slightly so. On Tuesday, the S&P 500 index of U.S. stocks was up less than a percent. Bitcoin volatility rising a bit since late April is likely making it harder for traders to figure out what’s going to happen before and after the network’s once-in-four-year reward halving from 12.5 to 6.25 BTC, set for approximately May 12. Pascal Gauthier, CEO of cryptocurrency hardware wallet maker Ledger, said his company has been doing brisk sales of devices and solutions for investors to store crypto ahead of the 2020 halving.

Oil is having another double-digit price gain Tuesday, up 12.8% and priced at $26.54 as of 20:20 UTC (4:20 p.m. EDT). Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst for online trading at investments provider IG, doesn’t expect oil’s volatility to subside anytime soon, either. Read more: Amid Economic Meltdown, Bitcoin Winning as ‘No Value’ Buffett Eats Crow“Everyone was clearly too bearish down at $10 and lower,” Beauchamp said. “But with the price up almost three-fold from its April low, the polar opposite risk now looms.

Meanwhile, revenue from bitcoin was $306 million, the first quarter in which bitcoin revenue surpassed all other revenue on the app. “In the first quarter, Cash App gross profit grew 115% year over year,” the shareholder letter reported. Gross profit on Cash App, however, remains to be found primarily outside of crypto. Of Square’s $222 million in non-bitcoin revenue, $178 million of that was profit. The Cash App saw one of its best quarters yet for new users in the first quarter of 2020, across its many different services.Bitcoin profit through Square’s Cash App was $7 million in the first quarter of 2020. It earned $8 million in bitcoin profit through the whole of 2019.Still, on the revenue side, the year-over-year growth in bitcoin sales was steep.In a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the company noted: “Bitcoin revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2020 increased by $240.6 million or 367%, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2019. The increase was due to growth in the number of active bitcoin customers, as well as growth in customer demand.”Total revenue from bitcoin in the first quarter was $306 million, versus $65 million in the first quarter of 2019. Square earned $178 million in bitcoin revenue through the prior quarter, the last of 2019. Total revenue for Square this quarter was $1.38 billion, roughly 43% over what it earned in the first quarter of last year. Square had $535 million in gross profit for the quarter, but a $105 million net loss.Square CEO Jack Dorsey described a few of the ways that the Cash App has found growth during the COVID-19 crisis. For example, by making it easy to do direct deposits into Cash App, the firm saw enormous growth, Dorsey said in Wednesday's earnings call. Direct deposit users were more likely to use more of Cash's other services, such as peer-to-peer payments and bitcoin purchsaes. Further, Square collaborated with companies like Twitch and Spotify so fans could directly support their favorite creatives.Read more: US Treasury Approves Square as Coronavirus Stimulus Lender""We have reached a very mainstream influencer audience,"" Dorsey said.

33,www.coindesk.com,,How Oil Going Negative Could Open the Door for Bitcoin ETFs - CoinDesk,https://www.coindesk.com/oil-going-negative-bitcoin-market,"A bitcoin ETF would be based on a financial commodity that runs on a global 
network accessible to all. Most of the main exchanges have market ...","Apr 27, 2020 at 01:15 UTC",This will always be remembered as the week when oil went negative.,"The economic repercussions of this are staggering and will take months to fully comprehend – but, more short term, one of the most fascinating aspects is how it knocks universally accepted truths about markets right into the oil can. Also compelling is what this says about biases in the bitcoin market. You're reading Crypto Long & Short, a newsletter that looks closely at the forces driving cryptocurrency markets. Authored by CoinDesk's head of research, Noelle Acheson, it goes out every Sunday and offers a recap of the week – with insights and analysis – from a professional investor's point of view. You can subscribe here. It turns out commodity prices don’t have a floor. Who knew. To be fair, this is not the first time a commodity has traded below zero – natural gas prices have gone negative in the past as logistical problems make it hard to get to buyers, and many refineries see it as a waste byproduct of oil production. Outside the energy sector, dairy farmers across the U.S. are currently dumping excess milk rather than pay consumers to take it away.What does this have to do with bitcoin? It sheds light on the nature of the asset itself, and on products built on top of it. According to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and other regulators, bitcoin is a commodity. Technically, it falls into the category of financial commodities, which include currencies and indices. These do have a floor. They can go to zero, but not below – once at the minimum, they have neither a use nor a carry cost, so investors can write off their value and, after some gnashing of teeth, forget about them.But what if a financial commodity’s value was based on an underlying commodity that traded at negative prices? USO is the largest exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the energy sector and holds near-dated WTI futures. This week those futures were trading below zero, since they involve physical delivery of oil that no one knows where to store. But the ETF is a financial commodity, and cannot trade below zero – therefore, it cannot reflect its underlying assets.This week, USO scrambled to save its listing. It announced a reverse share split to push its price back above the Nasdaq minimum requirement, and it changed its investment strategy to focus on slightly longer-term futures. It also applied for authorization to issue more shares, since money is pouring in, reportedly from retail investors who hope to ride the recovery all the way up. So, here you have an ETF whose value does not necessarily reflect the underlying asset, maneuvering to be able to sell more shares to retail investors in a dislocated market that is one of the most blatantly manipulated in the world. And yet, bitcoin ETF proposals are rejected as being too risky, opaque and manipulable.A bitcoin ETF would be based on a financial commodity that runs on a global network accessible to all. Most of the main exchanges have market surveillance, and improvements in market liquidity should enable the ETF price to closely track the market value of the underlying asset, giving investors reassuring clarity and transparency. The same cannot be said of the most liquid listed bitcoin-tracking instruments today,* which have lock-in periods during which investors cannot sell and which trade at a significant premium to bitcoin. This is largely a result of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s reluctance to approve liquid and easily redeemable investment vehicles suitable for all types of investors. Any change in SEC policy regarding bitcoin ETFs is unlikely in the short term because there are no current proposals under consideration. But the disconnect between the reasons given for rejection and the glaringly public characteristics of many approved ETFs that also don’t meet the quoted criteria could encourage the regulator to overcome its instinctive reluctance. (*One of these is GBTC, managed by Grayscale Investments, which is owned by CoinDesk's parent, DCG.)There is no such thing as a boring week in the crypto asset sector (unfortunately – a boring week would be nice every now and then), but this week was particularly intense, with the price ranging 12 percent from low to high (data from the CoinDesk BPI). According to my colleague Zack Voell, the sharp jump upwards may have been motivated by the futures expiry on Friday, as well as by investor sentiment primed for a move after the recent consolidation. And maybe – just maybe – it has something to do with mounting excitement over the upcoming bitcoin halving, expected in just over two weeks. (Download our recent report on the bitcoin halving for analysis of its potential impact.)In the news, new crypto asset products keep flowing thick and fast, while increasing attention is being paid to enterprise applications including the handling of data in a post-COVID-19 world as well as central bank digital currencies. And DeFi continues its process of growing up.Outside the crypto space, things are getting even weirder as disinfectant manufacturers plead with us not to inject their products, and traders eye their bathtubs and kitchen pots for possible oil storage. Tensions are rising in Europe as Italy, the European Union's third-largest economy, has been pity-spared a drop to junk bond status. Asian markets are dealing with the suspense over North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un’s health and the unrelated threat of a second wave of contagion. Markets are reeling between relief things aren’t even worse and fear they will be, with a dose of denial thrown in. Bitcoin has outperformed the S&P 500 so far this week, month and year to date, although gold and long-term government bonds have done significantly better so far this year. Next week will see a slew of economic indicators that will most likely be shockingly awful, but this week the futures actually went up on the news that more than four million people applied for benefits, because it seems confirmation of bad news is somewhat reassuring. You do have to wonder when the penny will drop that indices suspended from reality don’t stay afloat forever. On the other hand, some economies are tentatively eyeing a re-opening of some sort, which will bring a welcome if tentative respite to restive animal spirits. The Economist magazine dives into the options available to governments trying to figure out how to guide their economies out of this crisis. The options, none of which look good, include following the “financial repression” policies of the post-war economies of the previous century, which could take the form of capital controls, fixed exchange rates, rationed bank lending and caps on interest rates. It acknowledges such changes would be “politically demanding,” but that these are politically demanding times. “But if governments did enact such changes,” it goes on, “they would spur responses unavailable to investors of the 1950s and 1960s, such as investment in cryptocurrencies and other immaterial products.” TAKEAWAY: Exactly. The modern economy has gone through hardship before that required ideological sacrifices, but not at a time when there were alternatives to central bank currencies, and not at a time when it was possible to move wealth without using the established system. Does that make governments weaker at the expense of empowered citizens? Or could the governments use cryptocurrencies to become empowered themselves?I’ve mentioned in this newsletter before that I worry about a sustained uptick in inflation once we have emerged from the worst of this crisis, and how that could be good for bitcoin’s value given its limited supply. But what if I’m wrong and we enter a world of deflation? Does that mean bitcoin will underperform? Not necessarily. The resulting boost in its purchasing power and its parallels to gold, which has traditionally done well in times of deflation, could give it fuel to outperform. TAKEAWAY: Bitcoin was born during the last financial crisis, so its reactions and correlations have not been tested. We do not know under which scenario it will perform best, and economic theory can justify swings either way. Crypto asset platform Coinbase describes the current stablecoin landscape, with a focus on use cases. TAKEAWAY: The power of stablecoins to encourage liquidity, facilitate transactions and act as collateral is just beginning to be understood. The growth this year is likely to continue to be staggering, driven largely by both transaction demand and a surging global demand for dollars, of which stablecoins are a relatively convenient and liquid representation. (For more on this topic, see Michael Casey’s newsletter, “Money Reimagined,"" from last week.)A research paper funded by University of California Berkeley’s Haas Blockchain Initiative concludes stablecoin issuances do not push up the price of cryptocurrencies. TAKEAWAY: This contradicts a controversial paper from last year that aimed to prove tether manipulated the bitcoin market. The new paper separates tether in circulation from tether held in treasury, and shows the stablecoin’s premium to the dollar depends largely on the market volatility.  More nuance on last week's news that Renaissance Technologies has submitted regulatory filings showing its flagship fund Medallion can invest in bitcoin derivatives – as we hinted last week, it’s not as bullish as the media initially painted it. TAKEAWAY: My colleague Ian Allison asked several industry insiders for their take on the news. All agree Renaissance is not necessarily going “long bitcoin.” The story and the potential are not what drives their decisions; those are based on algorithmically generated numbers.Starbucks and McDonald's are reportedly among 19 restaurants and retail shops that will be involved in testing China's central bank digital currency in the country's Xiong'An new district. TAKEAWAY: Why is this potentially relevant for portfolios? Because mandated change is usually more powerful in overcoming resistance to new habits than the pull of innovation on its own. A national digital currency would get people comfortable with the idea of digital wallets, for instance, and from there it’s a relatively short step to incorporating other tokens and services. This is potentially significant because of its indirect relevance to the adoption of crypto assets in one of the largest economies, in which almost one billion people have a smartphone.Wolfie Zhao walks us through changes to the bitcoin mining industry in China over the past year, going into the impact of the coronavirus, how the March crash shifted sentiment, and the outlook for the new machines hitting the market. TAKEAWAY: As we talked about in our Halving Report, the bitcoin mining industry is not only fascinating, it’s fundamental for the health of the network. Shifts in technology, economic conditions and political environment determine profitability which in turn impacts the protocol’s resilience. For more on this intriguing sector, at the intersection between business priorities, technological innovation and ideology, check out Christine Kim’s podcast series on miner economics. The CFTC has given crypto startup Bitnomial Exchange approval to offer physically settled futures and options contracts. TAKEAWAY: Not that long ago a lot of us got excited about the pending launch of physically delivered derivatives on Bakkt, which ended up having a disappointing launch and an even more disappointing trading record. Bitnomial’s fee and margin structure might end up being more attractive to investors and traders, but, unlike Bakkt, for now it lacks the blue-chip backing of a market incumbent.Crypto asset and blockchain data provider Amberdata lays out a detailed explanation of the stock-to-flow (S2F) model that predicts a bitcoin price of $100,000 by the middle of 2021. TAKEAWAY: The S2F model has adherents and skeptics – it seems to hold historically, but that’s not generally a good basis for forward investing, especially in these strange times. Check out our Halving Report for a look at some competing theses. The bottom line is the bitcoin market is so different now than during the previous halvings that no one knows what features or developments will carry more weight in price impact. Vishal Shah, founder of bitcoin derivatives exchange Alpha5, points out that, with 100x leverage available on some exchanges with relatively light oversight, bitcoin won’t interest “traditional” capital, especially in these uncertain times. TAKEAWAY: It’s unlikely that 100x leverage is actually used by most traders, however – the few brave souls that do so are likely to get wiped out pretty soon, leaving the more sensible traders who push the boat out to maybe 35x, if that. “100x leverage” is more a worrisome marketing gimmick than a wealth accumulation strategy.Security token platform Openfinance has asked its users for revised terms to defray costs in a bid to avoid having to suspend trading. TAKEAWAY: After intensifying in 2018, interest in security tokens has been muted over the past year or so because investor demand failed to materialize and contract frictions set back some high-profile projects. This development is an extension of the damped enthusiasm but should not be taken to mean that the concept has no merit. It’s early, the advantages so far have not been enough to overcome inertia and the fact that traditional markets are more liquid and have greater regulatory assurances. Given the recent market stress exposing a range of fault lines, though, we might – once things start to settle down a bit – start to see a renewed interest in an alternative capital markets system.

Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency the 89-year-old Buffett described in February as having ""no value,"" is up 23% this year to about $8,870. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index of large U.S. stocks, which Buffett routinely endorses for amateur investors, is down 12%. Shares of Berkshire Hathaway, Buffett's insurance-to-utilities conglomerate and investment vehicle, are down 21% in 2020.Morehead, a former Goldman Sachs mortgage-bond trader who later oversaw foreign-exchange options at Deutsche Bank in London and headed macro trading at the renowned hedge fund Tiger Management, started Pantera in 2013 as a bitcoin investment firm.  In a monthly letter last week, he echoed Buffett's sentiment that there's little visibility right now on the global outlook: ""This is a really distressing, massively confusing time,"" Morehead wrote. What's clear already, according to Morehead, is the pandemic's devastating toll on the economy and the likelihood things won't get much better anytime soon. That means big government deficits are coming, accompanied by unbounded money printing.All that bodes well for bitcoin, according to Morehead – especially with the additional kicker coming next week from its underlying blockchain's quadrennial ""halving,"" where the pace of new supply gets cut in half. Bitcoin is seen by many crypto investors as a bulwark against inflation.""Like hydrostatic pressure, that flood of new money will float all boats,"" Morehead wrote. ""I strongly believe it’s close to inevitable that this will be very positive for cryptocurrency prices."" The economic gloom is pretty stark. According to The Wall Street Journal, a report due Friday from the U.S. government could show the unemployment rate rose to 16% in April, which would represent a record high in data going back to 1948. According to Politico, some estimates put the jobless rate rising to 22%, approaching the Great Depression high of 24.9%. The U.S. Treasury Department said Monday it will borrow a record $3 trillion this quarter, a six-fold increase over first-quarter levels, to help fund coronavirus-related emergency spending.Even Buffett warned, at his company's annual shareholder meeting on Saturday, of the potential ""extreme consequences"" of the Federal Reserve's moves to prop up corporate debt, according to CNBC.  “We’re doing things that we really don’t know the ultimate outcome to,” Buffett said. According to The New York Times, Buffett is neither optimistic nor pessimistic, but ""realistic.""These days, though, it's the crypto investors who seem more in touch with reality: ""Record monetary and fiscal stimulus"" are now driving the economy and markets, as Arca Funds, a cryptocurrency-focused investment firm, put it Monday in a newsletter. So far in 2020, the markets are on their side. ""If your entire investment thesis for owning stocks and bonds requires this much intervention just to survive, shouldn't every debt and equity investor at least be willing to listen to alternative thought processes?"" Arca wrote.To be fair, Buffett says he's looking to spend $30 billion to $50 billion on a special investment, so it might be hard to put that much into bitcoin without driving the price a lot higher; after all, the cryptocurrency's entire outstanding market value currently stands at about $163 billion.  Buffett told CNBC interviewer Becky Quick in February that he didn't own any cryptocurrency and ""never will.""He might be missing the boat: There's a growing body of investors who see bitcoin as a promising investment for such depressing times. According to The Block, the Wall Street firm Jefferies recommended last week that investors buy bitcoin. And a newsletter sent Monday by the London-based crypto investment firm ID Theory included a chart showing how dramatically money managers turned last week in their bets on bitcoin futures: Pantera's Morehead wrote in his letter last week that bitcoin prices could climb as high $115,000 by next year, a 13-fold increase over current levels. Buffett's shareholders might drool over such returns. ""If you can find something that goes up in the biggest crisis in a century, you should have some of that in your portfolio,"" Morehead wrote. ""I think this is only the beginning.""At the meeting on Saturday, Buffett ""left investors with a sliver of hope,"" according to The New York Times. “The American miracle, the American magic has always prevailed and it will do so again,” he said.Based on the prognostications of crypto investors who this year have proven more oracular than Buffett, that magic might come from entrepreneurs working to develop alternatives to the current financial and monetary system – and their inventions, including bitcoin.Price: $8,885 (BPI) | 24-Hr High: $9,112 | 24-Hr Low: $8,616Trend: Bitcoin has again failed to keep gains above $9,000 and remains stuck in a six-day narrowing price range. The cryptocurrency is trading near $8,880 at press time, down 0.07% on the day, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.The analyst community remains optimistic about prospects of prices rising to $10,000 ahead of next Tuesday's mining reward halving.However, the weekly MACD histogram, an indicator used to gauge trend strength and trend reversals, has crossed above zero, confirming a bullish reversal. That indicator, it's worth noting, is based on moving averages and tends to lag prices.Bitcoin has already rallied by over 35% in the last two weeks. Further, it is up nearly 130% from the low of $3,867 reached on March 13. Such strong bullish moves are usually followed by corrections. The multiple rejections above $9,000 are indicative of buyer exhaustion.As a result, a range breakdown on the 4-hour chart looks likely. That will likely cause some buyers to exit the market, leading to a deeper drop, perhaps to the 200-day average at $8,000.If the range is breached to the higher side, it would imply a continuation of the rally from lows near $6,500 observed on April 16. Stronger evidence of bullish revival would be a violation of resistance around $9,250 – a trendline falling from the June 2019 and February 2020 highs. Bitcoin failed to absorb selling pressure around that resistance last week.

The company ...","May 1, 2020 at 09:30 UTC","Argo Blockchain, a bitcoin mining firm listed on the London Stock Exchange, reported stellar 2019 earnings Wednesday. The company attributed its success to cutting off its consumer-facing arm and focusing on mining some 1,330 bitcoin (BTC) on the year.","In its full-year results, Argo said 2019 revenue was up 11-fold from the year before, a dramatic spike from $948,000 to $10.7 million. Argo's earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) came to $1.74 million, compared to a $4.56 million loss in 2018.While partly the result of a significant capital outlay into mining equipment – with the number of active rigs increasing from 10,000 to 17,000 by year's end – the company said it also made savings by moving from its original mining-as-a-service (MaaS) business to mining for itself. Whole areas of the business, including customer support and acquisition, could be axed, the report said, with significant reductions also being made in the marketing budget. The company also shrunk its headcount from 11 to seven. CEO Peter Wall told CoinDesk the company's pivot last year means it can now focus all of its energies on optimizing mining equipment and remain competitive against its rivals. He said the move puts Argo in a good position to deal with the volatility and uncertainty from the COVID-19 pandemic and the upcoming bitcoin halving event. ""The lockdown in the first half of 2020 has thrown a curveball into the global economy, which is being felt everywhere,"" Wall said. ""However, given the crucial infrastructure investment Argo made last year, we now find ourselves in a very good place.""Read more: The Rise of ASICs: A Step-by-Step History of Bitcoin MiningArgo originally set out to offer mining services via a subscription model. The premise was that this would make crypto mining accessible to just about anyone, co-founder and then-executive chairman Jonathan Bixby told the Financial Times in 2018. But costs soon outstripped revenues, and Argo reported a pre-tax loss of $4.1 million in its 2018 financial report. The share price, which had been £12.50 ($15.55) at the IPO in August 2018, sunk to a low of £3.00 ($3.74) by the following February. As Argo faced the very real threat of a shareholder revolt, the company pivoted into mining for itself, increasing the number of mining rigs by 1,000 in May 2019. Argo continued its capital outlay so that by August 2019, co-founder Mike Edwards, who had replaced Bixby as new executive chairman, expressed confidence the firm was in solid health. Wednesday's results come three months after Argo first said 2019 had been a strong year. In January, it released unaudited figures that indicated the company was looking at a ten-fold revenue increase, which sparked a 3.55% increase in the share price. Read more: London-Listed Argo Blockchain Reports Tenfold Increase in Bitcoin Mining Revenue in 2019Wall said the full-year results meant the company entered 2020 with ""considerable business momentum"" and that it was ""on track to deliver strong growth in the first half [of 2020] compared with the corresponding period the year before.""The new executive chairman, Ian McLeod, who took over the position in January, said 2019's strong revenues allowed Argo to put pressure on the competition, especially smaller miners using outdated equipment. He also expressed ""cautious optimism"" in the macro backdrop, adding that looser monetary policy could contribute to a waning, if not full collapse, in confidence in fiat currencies. Cryptocurrencies, and especially bitcoin, McLeod said, could stand to benefit as investors hunt for stores of value independent of governments and central banks. Having already mined more than 900 bitcoin in Q1 2020, Argo is well on track to exceed the 1,300 bitcoin the company mined in 2019. The company is on track to soon hit 18,000 rigs – with a combined hash power of 730 Petahash (PH).Read more: Bitcoin Halving 2020: The ‘Arms Race’ for Miner Efficiency IntensifiesWhile Argo has been listed on the London Stock Exchange since 2018, the company's three mining facilities are all in Quebec, Canada, with the largest being a 40,000-square-foot facility near the town of Baie-Comeau on the Saint Lawrence River.As of press time, Argo's stock was trading at just under £0.06 (~$0.073) a share.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Ripple's XRP, a payments token, rose 30%.  Staking tokens give holders the right to weigh in on a blockchain’s governance — similar to the way shareholders vote for a company’s board of directors — while also giving them the ability to earn a share of newly minted tokens, in the manner of a dividend or bond coupon.The strong performance of Tezos is “likely in part due to increased investor interest in staking-based returns,” said Joseph Todaro, managing partner at Blocktown Capital, an investment firm specializing in digital currencies. Some cryptocurrency exchanges offer staking as a service to make it easier for investors to participate, and Tezos has benefited recently from new listings on the exchanges Bitfinex and Binance. It’s been on Coinbase, another exchange, since last year.Ethereum, whose native token ether is the second-biggest cryptocurrency after bitcoin, plans to upgrade to a staking model in July. Some analysts say ether has generated additional enthusiasm among speculators due to the transition to staking.Tezos has doubled on a year-to-date basis, despite a bout of volatility along with bitcoin, ether and other tokens earlier this year.One caveat for traders is that Tezos has a market value of just $2.1 billion, less than 1/70th of bitcoin. So Tezos has the potential for big losses alongside any fast gains, even when compared with the notoriously volatile bitcoin; in March, Tezos tumbled 41% as bitcoin slid 24%. “The price movement of any given crypto asset is partially dependent on current investing narratives,” said Todaro. BTC: Price: $8,995 (BPI) | 24-Hr High: $8,9958 | 24-Hr Low: $8,415Trend: Bitcoin is on the rise, having bounced up from its key average support early Friday.The original cryptocurrency is trading near $8,995 at press time (updated), representing over 4% gains. Prices defended an ascending 50-hour average support during Asian trading hours. The average has consistently restricted downside and reversed pullbacks in the recent rally that pushed bitcoin from $6,800 to $9,400. As a result, the immediate bias will remain bullish as long as prices are trading above the 50-hour average, which is currently at $8,751. If the latest bounce from the average support ends up clearing the immediate resistance at $8,913, bitcoin will likely revisit $9,200.While the hourly chart is reporting bullish conditions, the daily chart studies also show buyer exhaustion. It's possible there could be a break below the 50-hour average support, which would take bitcoin down to $8,500.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Is it good or bad for bitcoin?,"The coronavirus pandemic has so completely upended the global economy that energy demand has fallen off a cliff. People are barely driving. People are barely flying. You're reading First Mover, CoinDesk's daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.The imbalance came to a head this week as oil storage tanks started to fill up, forcing traders to pay extra to get rid of their delivery obligations – resulting in negative prices. The May futures contract on West Texas Intermediate crude, which expires Tuesday, tumbled to minus $37.63 a barrel, from a positive price of about $30 on Friday. The June contract slid 15 percent to about $21 a barrel, leaving the black gold down more than 60 percent in 2020. Bitcoin slid 3.5 percent on Monday to about $6,900, a pretty tepid reaction for notoriously volatile cryptocurrency markets. So what are the takeaways from the unprecedented oil price sell-off? CoinDesk gathered the views of crypto-market traders, analysts and executives. (Quick teaser: Bitcoin suddenly doesn't look so volatile compared with oil, as noted by pro-crypto twitterati here and here.) 1) In the short term, falling oil prices are deflationary. Drivers will need less money to pay for gasoline once they return to driving. Airlines will pay less for jet fuel. Plastics manufacturers will see lower input costs. More broadly, for bitcoin traders who see the cryptocurrency as a hedge against inflation the oil-price crash offers a warning of how deflationary the coronavirus-driven economic recession might turn out to be – despite trillions of dollars of money injections from the Federal Reserve and other central banks.""If you want to view bitcoin as an inflation hedge, this whole thing is going to put some pressure on bitcoin as well,"" says John Todaro, director of research at TradeBlock. ""The dollar right now is really strengthening against all assets."" 2) As a commodity, bitcoin doesn't have storage considerations like oil – or physical delivery issues like gold.  Futures markets with physical delivery require traders to come up with the goods if they own a contract going into the expiration date. There's little likelihood that delivering bitcoin would ever collide with physical capacity constraints.""The oil markets are yet another inefficient legacy system that needs to be disrupted,"" Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer of Arca Funds, wrote in an email. ""The fact that it is physically impossible to take delivery of a barrel of oil shows that this system, like many, is completely broken and in need of change."" 3) Amid this year's economic and market turmoil, bitcoin is holding up. A study published last week by researchers at the Federal Reserve's Kansas City branch noted that historically, 10-year U.S. Treasury notes have worked well as a safe-haven asset ""consistently,"" gold ""occasionally"" and bitcoin ""never."" But so far this year, bitcoin is down just 3.8 percent – nearly holding its own against the Fed's own U.S. dollar. Gold is up 12 percent, but the Standard & Poor's 500 Index of U.S. stocks is down 13 percent. Oil's price crash makes bitcoin look stable by comparison.  ""For all those who've challenged bitcoin's use as a store of value or the narrative that bitcoin hasn't held its value all that well during the crisis, I beg to differ,"" Mati Greenspan, founder of the cryptocurrency and foreign-exchange analysis firm Quantum Economics, wrote in an email to clients. 4) A bitcoin exchange-traded fund application might now compare favorably with oil ETFs.  Bitcoin prices tumbled 40 percent on March 12 as investors and traders across all financial markets scrambled into cash. Such volatility underscore the risks of cryptocurrency markets, and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has thus far refused to approve a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). (Aside from high volatility, the market has also been hit by market-manipulation allegations.) But the oil market, which has several approved ETFs , operates in the shadow of OPEC, an international cartel of oil-producing nations that attempts to set the price via output quotas. New signs of just how volatile the oil market can be might undercut some of the reasons for delaying a bitcoin ETF approval. ""A bitcoin ETF is too risky but can I interest you in options on levered oil ETFs?"" Juthica Chou, former COO of the bitcoin-derivatives company LedgerX, tweeted on Monday. 5) More government bailouts are likely, along with more central bank emergency lending. With oil prices crashing, debt defaults are likely to surge in the energy industry. Banks might face higher loan losses, and bond markets could become increasingly wobbly. Federal Reserve Bank of New York President John Williams said last week in a speech that he and his colleagues ""are dedicated to doing everything within our power to support the functioning of financial markets and help put the economy on a strong footing."" It's unclear what the Fed could do for the oil market, or oil companies – or, for that matter, the next industry to falter under the economic toll. Given the assurances of Fed officials, it's hard to rule out more stimulus. That could mean more inflation once the economy recovers and demand returns. ""They're going to pump more dollars into the system,"" Todaro said. 6) The drop in oil demand shows how rapidly the world is adopting new technologies. CoinDesk reported last month that remote working has been one of the unsung heroes of the coronavirus crisis; many professionals, representing half the economy, based on rough estimates, have been able to continue doing their jobs from home. The rapid shift – thanks, Zoom! – has allowed the economy to avoid deeper economic damage, especially critical with some 22 million jobless claims filed in the U.S. over the past four weeks. Bitcoin, along with digital-asset markets more generally, could benefit as more commerce is done via the Internet, reducing the usefulness of germy paper bills. Oil might be a loser. ""Technology has made oil both cheaper to produce and more efficient to use, which has slowed demand,"" Rich Rosenblum, a former Goldman Sachs managing director of oil trading who now leads the markets group at the digital-asset trading firm GSR, wrote in an email. ""In contrast, cryptocurrency is a futurist product, benefiting from the continued march towards a technologically interconnected existence.""7) Unlike oil, bitcoin's supply is predictable. The price plunge in the oil patch already has led to supply-cutting agreements by giant state producers including Saudi Arabia, Russia and Mexico, and U.S. producers are likely to shut production in response to falling profitability. Bitcoin miners might drop out of the network when prices tumble – or, perhaps, after next month's rewards halving cuts their profitability. But issuance of new supply is strictly regulated by the cryptocurrency's underlying computer programming when the blockchain network was launched 11 years ago. ""Unlike oil, bitcoin's rate of emission is controlled by its own protocol and does not change based on geopolitical events,"" Joe DiPasquale, CEO of the cryptocurrency hedge fund BitBull Capital, wrote in an email. ""The crash in oil prices is a part of the current economic crisis, which is also witnessing mass fiat currency printing, which is devaluing wealth around the world. In contrast, bitcoin is limited in its total supply and its rate of emission actually decreases with time, making its supply curve much more predictable.""8) More coronavirus-related market surprises are likely in store. After swinging wildly earlier this year, bitcoin prices have stabilized in recent weeks in a range between roughly $6,400 and $7,400. One reason might be that the depth of the coronavirus-induced recession is still unknown. For weeks some oil industry executives have been warning of the potential for storage facilities to fill up without big production cuts. But not until Monday did the oil futures market witness negative prices. ""Bitcoin is trading sideways because we still don't really know what the economic shakeout is going to be,"" Todaro said. 9) Miner profitability probably won't be affected too much. Many big bitcoin miners use long-term power supply contracts to lock in wholesale electricity prices. So even if a steep decline in oil prices leads to lower costs for other generating fuels, such as natural gas, there might not be an immediate pass-through in terms of lower production costs for bitcoin miners.""It's too much of a tertiary impact,"" Rosenblum said in a phone interview. By contrast, if bitcoin prices don't double in tandem with the halving in May, the crypto-mining industry might see a shakeout similar to ""what's just happened in the oil industry.""10) Bitcoiners are tired of all the shade throwing. Cameron Winklevoss, president of the cryptocurrency financial company Gemini, tweeted that ""oil can no longer be considered a reliable store of value."" Few investors probably ever saw it as that. But the broader point is that oil, long embraced by Wall Street titans including Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs as a grown-up market, now looks pretty janky in its own right. A review of #cryptotwitter on Monday revealed the schadenfreude was palpable. ""Whatever fingers are being pointed at bitcoin, it seems like it's much worse in the traditional commodity markets in terms of the massive dislocation,"" Rosenblum said. ""It takes away some of the criticisms of bitcoin being a funky market.""Trend: Bitcoin is looking weak, having printed losses on Monday alongside (but nowhere near as bad as) the crash in oil prices. Equity markets are down, too. The cryptocurrency is trading around $6,820 at press time with the daily chart reporting bearish conditions. For instance, Bitcoin's 4 percent drop on Monday confirmed a bearish lower highat $7,300.""On the daily chart, we have a lower second top,"" Chris Thomas, head of digital assets at Swissquote Bank, told CoinDesk. Monday's price slide also validated the weakening of the upward momentum signaled by the MACD histogram, an indicator used to identify trend strength and trend changes. As a result, a drop to $6,450, the lower end of the recent two-week-long trending range, may be seen. The cryptocurrency faced selling pressure on Monday, as West Texas Intermediate oil (WTI) dropped below zero for the first time, underscoring the collapse in demand caused by the coronavirus pandemic and forced investors to stocks.Sentiment remains fragile on Tuesday with the global equity markets still feeling the after effects of the oil price slide. At press time, major European equity indices are flashing red and the futures tied to the S&P 500 are reporting a 0.45 percent decline. Notably, markets are again buying the U.S. dollar amid a risk-off mood, as evidenced from the dollar index's 0.30 percent rise. Meanwhile, gold, a classic haven asset, is flatlined around $1,710. With dash for cash boding well for the greenback and equities feeling the pull of gravity due to recession fears, the path of least resistance for bitcoin appears to be on the downside.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Led by tether (USDT), the total outstanding amount of stablecoins surged this month to nearly $9 billion, from less than $6 billion in early March.Some cryptocurrency analysts are now starting to ask if the stablecoin surge will boost the price of ether (ETH), which is used to pay fees known as ""gas"" to help process transactions on the Ethereum blockchain, including for other tokens.Prices for ether, the second-biggest cryptocurrency by market value, have jumped 53 percent so far in 2020 to about $195. That compares with an 8 percent year-to-date gain for the larger bitcoin.Ryan Watkins, a research analyst at the cryptocurrency data firm Messari, wrote last week in a report that tether's use of the Ethereum blockchain ""should be positive for ETH.""""It's hard to ignore the promise of decentralized programmable money if you're spending time in the ethereum economy,"" he wrote. ""This will provide a bid for ETH.""Ether, sometimes described as the ""digital oil "" to bitcoin's ""digital gold,"" is the native currency for the Ethereum blockchain, which is known as a platform for easy issuance of new digital tokens as well as for its ""smart contract"" programming capabilities. In recent years Ethereum has become the premier ecosystem for the white-hot arena of ""decentralized finance,"" where startup companies and developer teams are designing automated lending and trading protocols that might eventually challenge banks. Yet, ether is notoriously difficult to value, with traders relying on everything from price-chart patterns to supply-and-demand predictions to  discounted cash flow analysis. Earlier this year, one blockchain consultant estimated that the cryptocurrency's price might shoot as high as $10,000 if half of Argentina's money supply abandoned the peso for dai, a decentralized dollar-linked stablecoin that's backed by ether. ""I don't think we're at a point where fundamentals are driving these tokens,"" says Gary Zigmond, co-founder of Digico Capital, a cryptocurrency hedge fund. ""We're still at the story stage, where everything's in the future.""Messari's Watkins says the rise of stablecoins might actually pose a longer-term threat to ether because they might usurp its potential use case as a ""medium of exchange.""""In this scenario, ETH will have devolved into its native early branding of digital oil, a commodity-like lubricant for the ethereum blockchain,"" he wrote. ""ETH would still be valuable like many commodities are, but ETH would not be valued like money is.""But with the price performance beating bitcoin's so handily this year, ether bulls probably aren't worrying too much about the valuation metrics. Trend: Bitcoin has nearly erased the losses seen on March 12 – ""Black Thursday"" – with a move to $7,800 early Monday, and now looks set to extend its five-week winning trend. The top cryptocurrency by market value is trading near $7,714 at press time, representing a 0.2 percent gain on the day. Prices rose more than 8 percent in the seven days to April 26 to confirm bitcoin's sixth straight weekly rise, the longest winning streak since March 2019. The price rise could be extended further, as bitcoin balances on exchanges continues to slide ahead of the miner reward halving – a sign investors are withdrawing their assets for long-term holding ahead of the supply-cutting event, as noted by the blockchain intelligence firm Glassnode. Bitcoin has historically put in a positive performance in the weeks leading up to halving, Marcus Swanepoel, CEO of cryptocurrency platform Luno, told CoinDesk. The bullish narrative surrounding the halving could continue to draw bids for the cryptocurrency in the short term. Further, speculation that savvy investors might use recently minted tether and other stablecoins to fund bitcoin purchases is likely to keep retail interest high. ""Traders will want to pay close attention to the issuing of new USDT, which has historically led to a surge in bitcoin's price. With Tether having minted $120,000,000 USDT, Bitcoin could soon see a surge,"" said Swanepoel. Technical charts, too, are signaling scope for an extension on the price rally. The four-hour chart is reporting a symmetrical triangle breakout, a bullish continuation pattern. The breakout is backed by an above-50 reading on the 14-day relative strength index and higher bars on the MACD histogram, both bullish signals. Next, the cryptocurrency looks set to test the 100-day moving average at $8,000. The bullish case would weaken if the prices violate the support at $7,390 (low of the symmetrical triangle).The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

GBTC is currently up 91% from those lows and will likely see further gains should bitcoin continue its phenomenal April 29-30 rally.

mining equipment, is taking another stab at going public, this time ...","Apr 25, 2020 at 18:51 UTC","Ebang International Holdings, one of the leading manufacturers of bitcoin mining equipment, is taking another stab at going public, this time farther from home and with a smaller fundraising target.","The Hangzhou, China-based firm aims to raise up to $100 million from an initial public offering (IPO) in the U.S., according to an April 24 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The Chinese firm would be listed under the ticker symbol EBON on the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq. Loop Capital Markets in Chicago and AMTD Global Markets in Hong Kong are the underwriters on the deal. This is Ebang’s second attempt to go public after it failed to do so on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEX) in June 2018. The target proceeds from that would-be IPO were estimated to be $1 billion. Founded in 2010, Ebang is among the earliest China-based hardware companies, such as Bitmain and Canaan Creative, to make application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) chips and fabless integrated circuits (ICs) for bitcoin mining machines. Chinese miners contribute over 65 percent of the computing power on the Bitcoin network. Ebang generates over 82 percent of its revenue from making bitcoin miners. It raked in $109 million in revenue last year, down nearly 66 percent from 2018. Its net loss for 2019 more than tripled to $41.1 million, according to the filing. The firm confidentially filed for the IPO in February without disclosing pricing terms, according to Renaissance Capital. Ebang is one of several crypto companies that failed to launch an IPO in Hong Kong and later came to the U.S. for another shot. Rival bitcoin miner makers Bitmain and Canaan Creative tried to go public on HKEX but their plans fell through because local regulators were reluctant to allow any crypto-related company listings. Canaan later managed to launch its IPO on Nasdaq last December. Huobi Group, one of the top crypto exchanges by volume, acquired a Hong Kong-based electronics manufacturer last year in a bid to get listed through a reverse takeover. However, the process has been put on hold due to strict mergers-and-acquisitions regulations. While Ebang is unsure of what impact the upcoming halving in May would have on bitcoin’s price, the firm sees ever-changing regulations in China, potential sharp drops in the price and the COVID-19 pandemic as substantial risk factors for its revenue streams, according to the filing. “The significant drop in the bitcoin price is expected to have a negative effect on the value of our bitcoin mining machine inventory and incentivize us to increase credit sales,” the firm said in the filing, referring to the March market crash.  The Chinese government once planned to phase out crypto mining businesses and did not change the provision until several months ago. Varying policies from different provinces also pose a challenge for bitcoin miners. For example, Xinjiang, an autonomous region in northwest China, one of the main areas that offer cheap electricity for mining farms, warned local mining enterprises that were operating illegally to close their operations before Aug. 30, 2018. Many small miners that did not register with the local government were considered illegal at the time. The coronavirus outbreak in China has delayed the delivery of mining machines from almost all the manufacturers to their clients. “The outbreak of coronavirus COVID-19 in China has resulted in a severe disruption of social and economic activities in China,” according to the filing.

A day later, the June contract tumbled more than 43 percent to a 21-year low of $11.57 a barrel. Bitcoin, though, barely flinched and held within its recent trading range between $6,400 and $7,400.But, according to data from CryptoCompare, bitcoin has outshone oil for far longer than just a few days when it comes price stability. In fact, ""black gold"" first started showing greater volatility – that is, the degree of fluctuation in the price of an asset – in early March, and has largely remained higher in April.CryptoCompare graphed 14-day rolling volatilities for oil, bitcoin, gold and the S&P 500. A volatility above 5 percent for 14 days translates to 25 percent or more on an annualized basis.""The more volatile, the bigger the percentage move, the riskier the asset (regardless of the direction),"" the firm told CoinDesk in an email.While bitcoin was the ""riskiest"" – most volatile – asset of the four contenders at the start of the year, in early March, oil surged to levels above 0.10, and even as high as 0.15 later in the month. ""As the year progressed, the disagreement between OPEC and Russia, coupled with negative demand shock caused the oil price to collapse, making it riskier than bitcoin,"" said James Li, analyst at CryptoCompare. Bitcoin's volatility surge came soon after and is likely associated with the ""Black Thursday"" crash on March 12, which saw the cryptocurrency plunge to as low as $3,867 as all markets suffered from coronavirus-related shocks.While both assets have since seen volatility drop, it doesn't appear oil's price gyrations have come to an end yet. ""Without any significant catalysts for demand, there’s nowhere to put oil,"" said Daniel Masters, chairman of CoinShares, a U.K.-based digital asset management firm. Continued problems with the oil futures market could be on the horizon because of there's a shortage facilities for oil, according to Masters. ""The worst isn’t over yet, the May contract just got rolled into June this week, and when June contracts expire, it will be absolute carnage.""The June WTI contract is currently trading at about $16.60.See also: Coinbase Launches Price Oracle Aimed to Reduce Systemic Risk in the DeFi SpaceSo what's the safe haven in the storm of volatility? Gold is the least volatile of the four assets compared, according to the chart, never crossing 0.05. CryptoCompare's Li is concerned even cash may prove inflationary given the massive stimulus efforts so far. And it appears more is on the way in the U.S. after the Senate passed another stimulus bill later approved by the House of Representatives. If signed by President Trump, it will pump billions of dollars more into the economy.""Under these circumstances, we may see a shift to assets that cannot be perpetually diluted instead of papering over the cracks. For the moment cash is the only port in the storm, but that may prove to be a false hope in the mid to long term,"" said Li.

That healthy-yet-modest traction, which increased slightly since the recession hit, is dwarfed by incumbent crypto exchanges and custody providers. Out of the most well-capitalized crypto companies, BitMEX, Bitfinex, OKCoin and Xapo are the few that help support developers working full time on bitcoin’s fundamental software. This is the trunk and roots of the crypto industry.The nonprofit hub sponsoring the most Bitcoin Core contributors to date, Chaincode Labs, was forced to postpone its annual summer residency due to the coronavirus crisis. Adam Jonas, head of special projects at Chaincode Labs, said the nonprofit currently sponsors seven developers and intends to continue educational residency programs later this year.Bitcoin advocates have historically criticized exchanges such as Coinbase for not contributing more to these independent, open source developers.Sometimes it can be easy to lose sight of the fact this multibillion-dollar industry, with companies like Binance that employ hundreds of people, relies on software maintained by just a few dozen people and occasional volunteers. The CardCoins spokesperson said there “aren’t many people to pick from,” with regards to prolific contributors who aren’t already on the above-mentioned payrolls. So in March, as the Great Lockdown derailed summer plans to train more developers, CardCoins partnered with the fintech company Payvant to split a one-year grant for the Ukrainian contributor Hennadii Stepanov, who goes by Hebasto. “As business owners and bitcoiners ourselves, we’re grateful to the folks that work on the low-level, nitty-gritty stuff,” CardCoins said in a statement. “We don't see a world in which we work with a successful bitcoin company and that company doesn't also give back to the community.""Thanks to this grant, Stepanov said, he quit his job at a local university and can now focus on bitcoin full time. He quickly went from discovering bitcoin in 2017 to making a small contribution in 2018, an issue he found when setting up his own node. Now he’s among the world’s most prolific contributors. “Decentralizing should be on all levels, including contributions,” Hebasto said. “I saw how the bitcoin developer community embraced me as a first-time contributor. They share knowledge. I like those people. I like to learn from them.”Although CardCoins has seen a modest incline in the past few months, this move wasn’t inspired by extra cash to spend. Instead, the startup co-sponsored the grant because keeping bitcoin decentralized is fundamental to the firm’s business model. “Peer review is the cornerstone of Bitcoin Core and keeping bitcoin safe, generally,” the spokesperson said. “He [Stepanov] is making sure that Bitcoin Core will run on many different platforms in a safe way.”Most CardCoins users convert gift cards into bitcoin in under an hour using a phone number and a few pictures of the receipt and card details. This allows the startup to serve underbanked clients attracted to bitcoin’s censorship-resistant properties. “We’ve made enormous investments in compliance and our programs and procedures have been overseen by a former federal prosecutor,” CardCoins said of the mission to serve this user group without regulatory arbitrage. “Those customers are vital to the lifeblood of bitcoin.”The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Developers can now simulate the Stacks blockchain's new, hybrid consensus mechanism, which Blockstack calls Proof-of-Transfer (PoX).A functioning blockchain is key to Blockstack's ability to power a new kind of decentralized internet, one that gives users more control over their data and makes it much harder for content to be censored. The key innovation to this new consensus mechanism: it uses bitcoin. Besides regularly storing a hash of the Stacks blockchain on Bitcoin's, many of the node participants in the blockchain will receive rewards in BTC, a more reliable source of value than rewards in a Stacks' native token, STX. Read more: Blockstack's New Consensus Mechanism Creates New Use Case for Bitcoin""A successful trial of Proof of Transfer would signal a viable third option that relies instead on Bitcoin as a foundation for Web3 going forward,"" Blockstack PBC CEO Muneeb Ali said in a statement. ""It would literally create a new use case for BTC."" To recap, PoX uses miners and stackers. Miners log transactions, much as miners on the Bitcoin or Ethereum blockchains do, and stackers keep a copy of the blockchain while signaling which fork to mine on. Miners earn new STX from inflation, and they pay to participate in BTC. That BTC gets distributed to stackers, who have to stake STX. Bitcoin was originally incorporated as a way to tie the security to the most secure crypto network of them all and to give more users a better incentive to actively participate. As the design has evolved, the team has started to see more possibilities. In an email to CoinDesk, Ali said:""Users can do thousands of transactions on the Stacks chain and the Bitcoin chain only sees a hash of the Stacks block. It starts to become more interesting when you start exploring potential movement of assets or cryptocurrencies between these chains e.g., Bitcoin getting locked on the Bitcoin chain and being used … on Stacks. This area is currently in R&D phase but we’re really excited about the possibilities.""We covered a similar project with a bridge between Bitcoin and Ethereum being built by Keep.All the BTC and STX on the testnet will be simulated, but there is a tangible reason for developers to take part. Blockstack has a series of bug bounties planned for everything from security to smart-contract functionality. By participating in the testnet, developers can help Blockstack identify problems and earn rewards.A few notes on the design for consensus on Stacks that will be tested here:The testnet will provide an opportunity for smart-contract developers to try out Blockstack's new programming language, Clarity, which will also be previewed there. Testnets can be an important opportunity for new networks to drive developer adoption. A report by Electric Capital last year showed that a well-designed testnet has consistently been one of the best tools for getting more developers interested in a new public blockchain. The Stacks blockchain first launched in late 2018. Blockstack expects a mainnet launch of its new consensus mechanism, Blockstack 2.0, this summer. The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

In an attempt to enhance anonymity, transactions are broadcast off the bitcoin blockchain and routed through encrypted communications.But according to two academic papers published in March and April, relatively straightforward cyberattacks could unearth balances on the Lightning Network. Authors of the March paper also unraveled pathways and parties of hidden payments.“The gap between the potential privacy properties of the Lightning Network and the actual ones is large. As it is designed right now, the Lightning Network opens the door for various attacks,” said Ania Piotrowska, a cryptography researcher at the University College London, which collaborated with the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign on the March study.Read more: Bitcoin’s Lightning Network Is Growing ‘Increasingly Centralized,’ Researchers FindNodes, building blocks of the Lightning Network, are software gateways that exchange bitcoin via payment channels. Both research teams, the other at the University of Luxembourg and the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, conducted attacks on only public channels. According to a report in January from cryptocurrency exchange BitMEX, 72.2 percent of Lightning Network channels are publicly announced, and 27.8 percent are kept private.“As Lightning Network gains popularity, it is often touted as an alternative to bitcoin that is not only more scalable but also more private,” said Piotrowska, who also works at cryptocurrency privacy infrastructure startup Nym Technologies. “We felt that it was an interesting research question to study how private Lightning actually is.”A raft of academic and corporate institutions have taken up Lightning Network development, from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Digital Currency Initiative to bitcoin satellite maker Blockstream, engineering group Lightning Labs and Square Crypto, the cryptocurrency unit of the publicly traded financial technology company Square. In December, Bitfinex, a high-volume cryptocurrency exchange, opted to let customers trade bitcoin over the Lightning Network.The American and British researchers, a team of seven, carried out three attacks on the Lightning Network during the months of December, January and February. Two attacks targeted the Lightning Network’s test network and main network to determine balances. By forwarding payments with fake hashes – unique cryptographic identifiers of transactions – to channels opened with 132 test network nodes and six of the 10 largest main network nodes, the first balance attack accessed the balances of 619 test network channels and 678 main network channels.The counterfeit payment spamming was stopped when error messages went away, a sign that actual channel amounts had been matched.Read more: Cannabis Shops Are Using Zap’s Lightning App During Coronavirus Cash CrunchAt the start of the first balance attack, 4,585 test network channels and 1,293 main network channels were trialed from 3,035 test network nodes sharing 8,665 channels and 6,107 main network nodes sharing 35,069 channels.The second balance attack also discovered the balances of randomly selected main network channels in a process of elimination with error messages. However, payment hashes were routed through two channels the researchers opened with two intermediate channels that sat between one start and one end channel.Piecing together changes in balances learned from the first two attacks, the third attack constructed snapshots of the Lightning Network at different time intervals to detect payment movements and their senders, recipients and amounts.“Identifying the sender and recipient means that we identify them according to their public keys and any other information linked to the node,” such as an IP address, a numerical string that tags the location of an electronic device that connects to the internet, she said. Public keys are handed out freely between parties in payment interactions; private keys that are guarded closely and that give ownership access of funds were not extracted.Piotrowska noted that, owing to ethical concerns, the third attack was performed on a simulation of the Lightning Network.Mariusz Nowostawski, a computer scientist at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology and one of four authors of the April paper, said the March paper’s first balance attack is a derivative of “an older, known method” and that the second balance attack, while new, is limited to small-scale attacks.The second balance attack “requires opening two channels for each single channel being probed, which is extremely costly as those opening and closing channels need to be on-chain,” Nowostawski said. “And it requires the balance in one of the channels to be placed on the side of the node being probed,” risking the attacker’s funds.Read more: Lightning Solves Bitcoin’s Speed Problem, but Watch Out for FraudstersTo stave off the loss of funds, an external liquidity service – similar to the Bitrefill liquidity provider used in the March paper attack – needs to fund the channel. Even so, the balance attack falls flat if a channel refuses to accept a channel opening, Nowostawski said.The balance attack studied by the Luxembourger and Norwegian researchers doesn’t expend resources or rely on intermediate channels, said Nowostawski. The attack is also an error-message-reading algorithm that probes channels, but supposedly on a larger and faster scale that reduces new channel openings, fund lock-up time and contact with the bitcoin blockchain.Benedikt Bünz, a Stanford University Applied Cryptography Group researcher who has partnered with cryptocurrency tracing company Chainalysis on blockchain research studies, called the papers important to privacy in cryptocurrencies.“For strong and good privacy, cryptographic solutions such as zero-knowledge proofs and confidential transactions are needed,” said Bünz. Zero-knowledge proofs, a cryptographic structure, could facilitate payments that don't leave traces of information behind with another party.Read both papers below:The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Without much fanfare, it's been adopted in some of the most popular Lightning wallets including Zap, Phoenix, Breez, Blue Wallet and Wallet of Satoshi, as well as dozens of other apps. Sending or receiving Lightning payments can often require a bit of set-up and a number of steps. Lnurl aims to simplify many common actions so that they instead require just a click or a QR scan.Lightning payments are an experimental payment method that could greatly improve the Bitcoin network, making payments faster, cheaper, and more scalable. But so far, the user experience (UX) is even more confusing than Bitcoin's, which, with its private keys that cannot be lost and jumbled addresses, is weird enough for the average Joe as it is.That's why developer and Bitcoin Lightning Wallet creator Anton Kumaigorodski decided to create a standard that would improve Lightning's UX, hiding a bit more of the underlying complexity from users.""I've noticed some clearly visible UX issues specific to Lightning Network wallets, all of them are solvable but require some kind of standard for wallets to converge on. Lnurl aims to be such a standard,"" Kumaigorodski said.Read more: First Mover: For Bitcoin Prices, Inflation Headlines May Matter More Than the RealityThe advantages include making it much easier to request ""inbound liquidity,"" meaning the user needs to make sure enough bitcoin is in the right spot in the network in order to receive payments, which is one of the more common and troubling UX problems for users. It also cuts out a couple of steps when sending money in a few common scenarios.This is a lot of information that someone needs to know before using Lightning, making it a pain to use, especially compared to more intuitive mainstream alternatives such as Venmo or PayPal.For example, to use Lightning, a user needs to put some of the bitcoin into the second-layer network by opening a ""channel"" with someone else. Say Alice deposits one bitcoin on her side. If Bob, her counterparty, has no money on his side, then she doesn't have ""inbound capacity.""This means she can send payments but can't accept them.To fix this, Alice would need to open a channel with someone who has bitcoins on their side. This is an obvious roadblock for easy payments over the network. Many new users open a channel, then run into the problem that they can't accept payments and aren't sure what to do. A number of services such as Lightning Loop and Bitrefill's Thor have launched to help users retrieve inbound capacity.With Lnurl (specifically, the part of the standard called Lnurl-channel) the process is greatly simplified, making these services a bit more automatic. A user just clicks a link to pay a little bit of money to retrieve more inbound capacity. Read more: Nasdaq Is Using R3’s Corda for Managing Digital Assets""You could scan a QR code and request an incoming channel from a service,"" Lightning and Bitcoin Core contributor Tim Akinbo said.The Breez wallet, for instance, adopted ln-channel in its point-of-sale app so merchants can top up their inbound capacity by scanning a QR code or clicking a link. ""No IT know-how is required,"" Breez CEO Roy Sheinfeld said.Another piece of the specification, Lnurl-withdraw, also makes it easier to move funds around.Say you earn some bitcoin in a Lightning app (a ""lapp"" in Bitcoin lingo). Maybe you win a few cents worth when playing the game Bitcoin Bounce, or someone tips you on Twitter via Tippin. The pocket change you receive will initially be stored in the app.However, say Alice wants to move her money from a game to her wallet so it's under her control or so she can spend it elsewhere (such as to automatically dispense food to chickens over the internet and watch them eat it over webcam). Without Lnurl, sending the funds to her wallet takes several steps.First, she needs to create an invoice in her wallet. Then she copies the long, jumbled string of letters and numbers generated to identify where the funds are to be sent. She switches over to the game, clicks on the withdrawal page, pastes in the invoice and clicks send.Read more: Network Bringing Bitcoin to DeFi Taps Libra Member Bison Trails for Staking ServicesLnurl potentially reduces this process to a simple scan in the app from which she's moving funds away.""One of the improvements include the ability to simply scan a QR code and withdraw funds from a service directly to your wallet, without the pesky workflow of generating an invoice and then submitting it,"" Akinbo said.It's worth noting that so far this standard only works in the wallets and apps that support it. The more wallets that use this standard, the better, Kumaigorodski said. Every service that adopts it will ease the process for users, doing a small part toward making the Lightning network easier to use for mere mortals.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Ethereum-based Status messaging app or the bitcoin-friendly mobile ...","Apr 23, 2020 at 21:47 UTC","A new bitcoin privacy technology was born this week, inspired by the politics of the “Great Lockdown.” ","On Monday, software engineer John Cantrell released a messenger application called Juggernaut. It’s built entirely on top of bitcoin’s scaling layer, the Lightning Network, and offers end-to-end encrypted, onion-routed, peer-to-peer messages.In some ways, Juggernaut offers a more secure and primitive version of the Ethereum-based Status messaging app or the bitcoin-friendly mobile app Sphinx Chat. But everything comes with tradeoffs and Juggernaut prioritizes privacy.While it's now in early beta stages, Cantrell said the idea was inspired by censorship concerns, such as those we’ve already seen during the coronavirus crisis, from WeChat and Facebook deleting posts about the pandemic to Google suspending an Idaho church app for allegedly violating Google Play’s new events policies. For just one more example, bitcoin advocate Knut Svanholm said Amazon forced him to remove a brief mention of the coronavirus from his self-published book in order to distribute it through Kindle.Read more: Europe Debates COVID-19 Contact Tracing That Respects Privacy“It seems like maybe we’re heading toward a type of world where the government may shut down communication channels, you can’t say these things on Twitter, etc.,” Cantrell said. “If I want to use some service with an API to, say, send emails or text messages or pretty much any API, I have to create an account with that website and use my credit card or bank account.”This messaging app doesn’t rely on a commercial server. Instead, the app runs on a Lightning node, from homemade Raspberry Pi devices to Casa models, so that bitcoiners can send messages directly between nodes by using their node public keys like usernames.This primitive beta allows users to open channels with a small amount of bitcoin, that can be sent back and forth without actually requiring payment, or pay small routing and transaction fees to the network if the user doesn’t use a direct channel. Either way, it would cost less than a dollar to send millions of private messages without relying on an external service. “In these LSAT or micro-payment-enabled APIs,” Cantrell said, referring to how Juggernaut plans to use Lightning Lab’s LSAT standard, “it allows for global access to almost any service. That’s the grand vision here. How do we allow someone to use any service without needing to go through the traditional route.”Read more: Bitcoin’s Lightning Becomes Latest Protocol to Court Publishers With MicropaymentsCensorship isn’t strictly a pandemic issue, pending legislation could jeopardize legal protections for technologists and service providers long after coronavirus fades into memory.The Eliminating Abusive and Rampant Neglect of Interactive Technologies (EARN IT) Act, a bill sponsored by South Carolina Republican Senator Lindsey Graham and Connecticut Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal may soon force tech companies to abide by new online child protection laws or risk lawsuits for unmoderated content.Riana Pfefferkorn, the associate director of surveillance and cybersecurity at the Stanford Center for Internet and Society, called the EARN IT Act a “stalking horse for banning end-to-end encryption,” supported by President Donald Trump. Eugen Rochko, founder of the decentralized social network Mastodon, which runs on federated servers, believes bills like the EARN IT Act could further entrench tech monopolies. On the other hand, he said decentralized platforms can still address moderation concerns without government censorship.  Read more: ‘0% Success’: Why Blockchain Apps Just Aren’t Taking Off“One benefit is that there's just, like, more moderation,” Rochko said of grassroots networks. “The other benefit is that the moderation is more flexible to global needs because there is not a predefined set of rules that come from a specific place.”From the perspective of Juggernaut’s Cantrell, creating a privacy tool for more decentralized social messaging felt like a “revolutionary” moment, discovering a radically different way to use bitcoin software. The Lightning Network could be used for anything from an “unstoppable poker room” to complex software services, he said. “The messages are being routed over the Lightning Network. They're not just simple messages, they’re server requests,” Cantrell said, adding the server requests could be configured to automate a wide range of computer functions. “I can access a paid API and pay for exactly what I use. It would allow for easier onboarding and global access.” Benjamin Powers contributed reporting.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Launching in September, BSDEX provides regulated access for both institutional and retail investors to a bitcoin-euro trading pair. In March, the exchange group's chief digital officer said the subsidiary is hoped to become one of the trusted gateways for regulated institutions to enter the digital asset space. BSDEX has said it's planning to list other digital assets going forward.In a statement, BSDEX CEO Dr. Dirk Sturz said stop orders were a ""logical step"" for the fledgling exchange, adding they were ""particularly important in the current volatile market phase. [As they] enable investors to react automatically to price volatility and to pursue a momentum strategy."" Stop orders help people automate aspects of their trading strategy and, rather than having to watch the market 24/7, let them establish points at which they want to buy or sell. While long a feature in traditional markets, they are increasingly commonplace in crypto: Binance, Kraken and Huobi have all already added them to their exchanges. See also: dYdX’s Crypto Loans Hit $1B Amid Coronavirus-Led VolatilityBut there are some pitfalls, as stop orders can just as easily compound losses for a trader, especially those not accustomed to trading cryptocurrencies. It's no secret cryptocurrencies are highly volatile assets. Back in June, for example, bitcoin flash crashed as the spot price fell from $13,700 to just under $11,400 in little more than an hour. It then temporarily recovered back to $12,000, before sliding back below again nine hours later. If a trader had put a stop order to sell at $12,000 and then gone out for lunch, they would have returned to see their position liquidated and, to add insult to injury, watched as the price then returned within the range they  wanted to hold at anyway.With bitcoin's volatility levels hitting a six-year high earlier this month, CoinDesk asked Boerse Stuttgart if it was an appropriate time to add stop orders for its clients, particularly as many may be more familiar trading traditional assets than cryptocurrencies. See also: You Call That Volatility? Bitcoin Traders Scoff at Wall Street’s GyrationsIn an email, Sturz told CoinDesk that stop orders allowed investors to manage and reduce risk, adding that they could be used to ""pursue a momentum strategy as they can react to ongoing price trends, both with stop buy orders in bull markets and stop sell orders in bear markets.""He added that BSDEX had also implemented ""volatility interruptions"" to protect traders from having all their stops triggered in a flash crash.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Keep also chose staking providers Staked, Figment and Boar Network as partners for staking services.“Infrastructure is important because if your node is being asked to sign a message or it’s holding onto BTC as one of the shards, you ideally don’t ever want to be offline,” Bison Trails protocol specialist Viktor Bunin told CoinDesk in an interview.Bison Trails provides “blockchain-as-a-service” for multiple chains including the Libra Association and Polkadot.

This benefits users by allowing them to accrue interest; it benefits DeFi protocols by allowing them to lean on bitcoin’s liquidity.

Cryptocurrency lenders and futures exchanges scrambled to protect themselves from losses, firing off a flurry of margin calls, in which traders are asked to post additional collateral against trading loans and derivatives contracts.“Over that 24-hour period, there were certain counterparties that got pinged three to four times,” Genesis CEO Michael Moro said in an interview. “With the way the price kept falling, you almost had to margin call them again an hour later.” Genesis is owned by Digital Currency Group, the parent company of CoinDesk. Over the course of the first quarter, Genesis managed to increase its book of active trading loans by 19% to $649 million, according to the report. But it wasn’t without considerable volatility: The loan book started the year at $545 million and had nearly doubled to $1 billion in mid-February before the rapid deleveraging in March.In early March, the brutal death toll and economic devastation of the coronavirus was only beginning to dawn on traders of both digital assets and traditional Wall Street securities like stocks and bonds. “We didn't know how bad the equities market was going to get,” Moro said. “We didn't know how long this sell-off and turbulence was going to last.”“Black Thursday,” as March 12 is now known among cryptocurrency traders, started out inauspiciously enough. Bitcoin was trading around $7,900 – off of February’s highs around $10,000, but still safely above the year-end 2019 price around $7,170.Moro said he headed out of the company’s New York City headquarters in downtown Manhattan to deliver a presentation to a private wealth management office. As he was speaking participants at the meeting started glancing at their smartphones, checking bitcoin prices and giving Moro up-to-the-minute market updates. They wanted to know why bitcoin price was falling. And it was no ordinary drop, dipping first below $7,000, then sliding to $6,000, then to $5,000. Read more: Bitcoin Falls Below $5K as Market Pain Deepens“I’m up there talking, answering their questions, and then at some point people were just fixating on the price of bitcoin on their phones,” said Moro, 42.He hustled back to the office, where employees were busy dealing with the deluge of margin calls. The firm’s clients, mostly institutional traders, were all able to post the required collateral on trading loans, avoiding forced liquidations of their trading positions, Moro said. The anxiety mounted, however: The additional collateral sent by clients was taking far longer than usual to arrive. According to Moro, the bitcoin network was so congested due to the heavy traffic that day that collateral postings got backed up. “Transactions that usually take 10 minutes might have taken a couple hours,” Moro said.Genesis staff also hurried to satisfy trading customers’ rapidly shifting financing needs. Bitcoin futures contracts that usually trade at a premium to the daily market price suddenly swung to a discount. Traders quickly adjusted their strategies, and Genesis suddenly started seeing a flood of clients returning dollar loans and asking for new loans denominated in bitcoin. “Thankfully we had no losses,” Moro said, “other than a really busy and stressful day.”Read more: Bitcoin Price Briefly Dips to 12-Month Low in Overnight TradingFor most Genesis employees, it was their last day in the office for a long time: On March 13, the company transitioned to working remotely.Genesis also tightened its lending policies after March 12, halting new loans for at least a week if they weren’t fully collateralized, Moro said.   “I just didn't want that risk on the Genesis balance sheet,” Moro said. “After we felt like markets had calmed down, we reopened the dialogue and restarted the origination machine.”Volatility is the norm in crypto markets.

The Dutch National Bank (DNB) estimates that registration alone costs $36,500, in addition to rolling compliance needs.The development shows what Dutch regulators expect of financial upstarts and could speak to future hurdles to cryptocurrency development in the greater European Union.“Above all, Bittr would have to appoint a dedicated compliance officer who’s responsible for compliance with the new regulations,” Ruben wrote Friday. “Who can I appoint? Myself? That probably doesn’t work also being the sole shareholder and director.”Read more: Dutch Crypto Startups Brawl With Regulators Over Scope of EU Money Laundering RuleUnder Dutch law, businesses pay for their own regulations out of pocket. Ruben said the options for his bitcoin savings platform included keeping a lawyer on retainer, paying a compliance officer or finding a third party to manage compliance costs in addition to the government registration fee – impossible, he said, given the firm’s small size.As CoinDesk reported in December, Dutch cryptocurrency firms were entangled in a protracted battle of semantics with the DNB and Ministry of Finance (FIN) over the implementation of the European Union’s 5th Anti-Money Laundering Directive (AMLD5), which went into effect in January 2020.Bitcoin firms CoinDesk spoke with said the DNB and FIN were strengthening the EU directive needlessly while using doublespeak with the Dutch Parliament. The firms alleged the financial regulators had created a de facto licensing regime whereas AMLD5 calls for mere registration of cryptocurrency firms. These allegations were further supported by the Dutch Council of State, a governmental advisory board widely respected in the country, which asked the finance agencies to clarify their proposals.Members of the Dutch Parliament held two competing priorities in mind: fighting money laundering and supporting the nation’s fintech firms.Read more: European Crypto Firms Brace for Higher Costs as AMLD5 Takes EffectIn a Parliamentary report from April 21, Dutch Senator Bastiaan van Apeldoorn said it's unlikely cryptocurrencies are being used on the same scale as cash for money laundering, but they still require supervision. Finding a soft regulatory touch that wouldn’t displace small players in the market remained the goal, he said.“The cryptocurrency phenomenon does exist and is likely to take on even larger, if not different, forms in the future. It is therefore good that this is also adequately regulated with regard to money laundering,” van Apeldoorn said. (Editor’s note: This report was translated.)The legislation was tied up on the point for months, even though the EU called for the directive to go into effect on Jan. 10. Legislation was finally adopted last Tuesday, although opinions on its outcome differ.Wrote Bittr’s Ruben:“The Minister of Finance (Wopke Hoekstra) then changed some wording so as to comply with the Council of State’s request but not actually changed any of its content. The Senate has raised questions about this practice but nevertheless approved the new regulations.”The registration process was still a licensing regime, verbiage aside, Ruben argued. “If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck,” he wrote.In a blog post last Wednesday, Bitonic, a Dutch exchange led by Daan Kleiman, who also heads a crypto lobbying group VBNL, said the final legislation “resolved the two main issues of concern for Bitonic.” The firm said the DNB and FIN had clarified the difference between licensing and registration plus the associated regulatory costs.“We will closely monitor this when the law has entered into force, but it appears that for now, the threat of an excessive and costly supervisory regime is off the table,” Bitonic wrote.Some firms haven't waited to see what the DNB and FIN would concoct, however. Industry-leading crypto derivatives exchange Deribit left the country for Panama in February, citing uncertainties around the incoming regulation.Read more: Dutch Derivatives Exchange Deribit to Move to Crypto-Friendly Panama“We believe that crypto markets should be freely available to most, and the new regulations would put too-high barriers for the majority of traders, both regulatory and cost-wise,” Deribit wrote in a January blog post announcing the move.Arthur Stolk, managing director of Dutch cryptocurrency fund Icoinic, told CoinDesk in an interview that most firms had anticipated the passage and are going to wait it out until a promised evaluation by FIN takes place. His largest concern for smaller firms is with the flat regulatory fee every market participant now has to pay for oversight, as compared to a per-volume cost applied in most cases.“The problem is that in normal traditional finance, if you are regulated and you have a license you need to pay by your volume. So, it's a fair deal. Now everyone pays the same. In one year they do the evaluation – please do it by volume because then all the small projects can stay,” Stolk said.And, unlike other governments, the Netherlands isn’t behind the times on crypto. In fact, it’s trying to lead the charge in the EU for issuing a central bank digital currency (CBDC), according to a recent DNB report. Read more: Dutch Central Bank Wants to Be European Union’s CBDC Proving Ground“If the decision should be taken within the euro system to experiment with a more concrete type of CBDC, we are ready to play a leading role,” the DNB wrote in its 45-page report published last week. “The Netherlands provides a suitable testing ground for such an experiment.”The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

He plans to buy some as soon as he turns 18 and can apply for a local mobile money account. “I will use it to open up a business,” he said.Ghanian exchange founder Nawaf Abd of eBitcoinics said local demand for bitcoin increased since the coronavirus crisis began, even though his physical stores in Accra and Kumasi are both closed. Through trading online, he continues to supply local buyers with bitcoin. He said his sales were up 70% in March, so much that some days he sells out of bitcoin, but declined to say how many users that entailed. His servers briefly went down in April due to overwhelming traffic on the site.CoinDesk senior reporter Leigh Cuen hosts the “Crypto Across Emerging Markets” panel on May 11 at 7:30 p.m. ET at Consensus: Distributed, CoinDesk's first virtual, free conference. Register here.According to researcher Matt Ahlborg, Ghanian volume at peer-to-peer exchanges LocalBitcoins and Paxful increased to roughly $6.2 million over 90 days of the lockdown, up from roughly $4.2 million the previous 90-day period. Yet another Ghanian student, 18-year-old Derrick Bannerman, bought his first bitcoin during the last dip. “I already had interest but the period seemed like the perfect moment to do something about my interest in bitcoins since we're at home doing nothing,” Bannerman said from Accra. “The thing that interests me the most is its increasing value, popularity and security.”And Nigerian bitcoin market activity is nearly 10 times Ghana’s. Ahlborg’s metrics showed roughly $63.9 million worth of Nigerian bitcoin trades during the lockdown. With some 60% of Africa’s 1.25 billion people under the age of 25, local traders, as well as crypto behemoths, are placing their bets on future growth.For example, Yele Bademosi, co-founder of the Binance-backed social payments startup Bundle, said thousands of Nigerians downloaded the Bundle app since it launched in late April. There’s been some traction in Ghana as well, where Bademosi said the startup is looking to expand. But so far Nigerian demand is overwhelming enough. Roughly a 1,000 people signed up for an introductory Zoom webinar about bitcoin, he said, although there was only room for 100 to attend. “It’s about making it easy to move value, regardless of whether it’s cash or crypto,” Bademosi said. “You can send [money] to any [smartphone] number in your contacts, even if they’re not on the app yet.” For now, the app offers a fiat on-ramp to users with Nigerian bank accounts and supports bitcoin, ether, BNB, plus will soon support Binance’s dollar-denominated stablecoin BUSD. “We have users who were interested in bitcoin but felt it was a little too difficult to get,” he said. “People use cryptocurrency as a remittance gateway as well as a hedge against any devaluations of local currency, plus speculative trading.”And local entrepreneurs aren’t the only ones to notice the opportunity on the continent. Senegalese-American hip-hop artist Akon is the latest celebrity to join the cryptocurrency industry, setting his sights on Africa. He created a startup and corresponding foundation, both called Akoin, advised by Bancor co-founder Galia Benartzi, to issue a pan-African currency. He’ll start in Senegal, where President Macky Sall sold the performer 2,000 acres of land to establish Akon City, and an industrial tech park in Kenya, Mwale Medical and Technology City (MMTC). The latter jurisdiction is expected to start using Akon’s cryptocurrency in the next few months.“[Akoin] will be the primary digital payment solution and currency within the city … for all kinds of things that are city-related, like paying utility bills.

Launching Friday, the company will initially support a bitcoin wrapper on the EOS mainnet – pBTC. Essentially, a user will be able to deposit funds in one network, say Bitcoin, and pToken will issue the user the equivalent amount of ""wrapped"" tokens on the new network. The company hopes to support a bridge between litecoin and EOS, as well as EOS and ethereum. An EOS wrapper for a tether ERC20 token is currently being planned, according to pTokens' website. Founder Thomas Bertani told CoinDesk there were no plans yet to consider developing an EOS wrapper for tether on Omni, a secondary layer on top of the Bitcoin protocol.  See also: Tether CTO Claims USDT Stablecoin Can Boost DeFi LiquidityA key benefit of interoperability is users can better leverage the different characteristics of different blockchains, Ardoino said. One of the initial reasons Tether created an ERC20 version in 2017 was so it could sidestep the congested Bitcoin network.   ""Omni was costing a lot of money, up to $500, Ethereum wasn't so saturated, so the fees were cheap. Every trader would have preferred to move the funds onto the Ethereum blockchain because it was cheaper and faster,"" Ardoino said. Ethereum speeds slowed due to network congestion by the end of 2017, however. Creating an interoperability bridge between it and EOS – which has higher throughput and much less chain activity – essentially provides users with a ""backup"" option, so they can continue to trade with minimal fees and quick settlement times, he claimed.Many crypto exchanges, including Bitfinex, already offer users two different types of tether, so the ability to swap between protocols already exists in some form. However, interoperability bridges make it easier for users themselves to move between the different protocols. Ardoino foresees Bitfinex and Tether will continue to perform chain swaps. Major exchanges looking to swap $10 million worth of tether between two chains will always be able to organize it with them directly, he said. But, he added, greater interoperability will allow retail investors with smaller amounts of tether to also shift freely between the different blockchains. See also: Tether Stablecoin Launches on Its Seventh BlockchainArdoino hopes his involvement with pTokens might encourage other developers to build bridges to other protocols, creating greater connections between all the different chains. Enhancing interoperability may one day act as the bridge for tether to launch on many other new protocols, he added.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

","Judge Freda Wolfson of the U.S. District Court of New Jersey dismissed a lawsuit Thursday that tried to argue the Colorado-based firm changed its name to ""Riot Blockchain"" in an effort to boost its share price. Riot Blockchain changed its name from Bioptix in October 2017 after announcing a move from biotechnology into bitcoin mining. The share price soon rocketed from $8 to a high of $38 by December 2017. The original complaint – filed in February 2018 when the share price plunged to $10 – argued the company misled investors by capitalizing on public interest in blockchain to drive up the share price. See also: Riot Blockchain Moves Part of Bitcoin Mining Operation to Upstate New YorkBut in Thursday's filing, complaints against Riot Blockchain, its CEO John O'Rourke, former CEO Michael Beeghley, and Chairman Jeffery G.

The plaintiffs can file a request to produce an amended complaint within 30 days. In February, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) told Riot Blockchain it, too, was dropping its investigation into allegations of securities fraud.

Collins said assets with longer histories and better data sources tend to lead to better predictions overall.A subset of artificial intelligence, machine learning uses computer algorithms combined with data inputs to predict future events. Interestingly, machine learning services should get better given how these systems learn from past data and predictions.Under the hood, the tool inputs “aggregate pricing data” from major exchanges that Nomics scrapes and cleans. That data is then fed into a purpose-built algorithm to spit out seven-day predictions in both a spot price and percentage change from the current price.The feed, which has been in the works for the past six months, Collins said, relies on the recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture known as long short-term memory (LSTM). “LSTMs are relatively new in the machine-learning space, and financial data is notoriously difficult to predict, but we were able to get fairly reasonable predictions, and we are fully transparent about their historical accuracy,” Nomics CTO Nick Gauthier said in a statement.Read more: Securitize Users Can Now Directly Trade Security Tokens With Just a Web LinkOf course, price predictions in any market, particularly crypto, can be exceedingly difficult to pin down.Collins said the team wanted to add a touch of professionalism with its data-guided predictions.

And while much has been made about bitcoin’s (BTC) gains of 7 percent since the start of 2020, ether (ETH) has been a shining star. Year to date it’s up roughly 50 percent. ","On Jan. 1, 2020, ether's price was $129.89, according to CoinDesk data. On April 27, ether was changing hands at around $192.25, not far off the $200.00 level hit on retail exchanges like Coinbase over the past weekend. “Really interesting to see ETH hitting the $200 resistance level a few times and breaking through,” said Jack Tan, founding partner at Taiwan crypto trading firm Kronos Research.Chris Thomas, head of digital assets at Swissquote Bank, told CoinDesk the price appreciation for ether is from bullishness over finance software applications on the Ethereum network. Read More: Ether Futures Activity Grows Ahead of July Protocol Upgrade“They’re drivers that we all know - DeFi, Ethereum 2.0 and more decentralized apps,” Thomas said. However, Thomas was more cautious on stablecoins, despite their recent surge on Ethereum. He pointed to long-term forecasts of near zero interest rates, especially regulated bank deposit-backed stablecoins running on the network such as USDC, PAX and BUSD.  “With very low interest rates and bid-offer spread tightening, stablecoins will move out of fashion as they'll become far less profitable,” he said. The 2017 bonanza for initial coin offerings, or ICOs, led to a flurry of projects raising capital by way of ether, which they subsequently sold off or spent otherwise. And that’s good for ether’s long-term price, says Antoni Trenchev, co-founder of cryptocurrency lending platform Nexo. “I don’t think many ICOs even have a treasury for it to get depleted now,” he told CoinDesk. Indeed, most ICO projects no longer hold ether to sell for cash anymore, according to data on the amounts raised and remaining ether balances charted by CoinDesk Research.Some sell pressure in ether is still possible, said Larry Sukernik, investment associate at Digital Currency Group, an institutional trading firm focused on digital currencies. CoinDesk is a subsidiary. “Projects that still have their treasuries stocked up with crypto that’s not their native token should be converting all of it to cash, Sukernik said. “They’re not in the business of managing crypto portfolios.”Even so, it’s clear most projects, especially the largest ones that raised ether in 2017 such as Bancor, Tezos and Filecoin, don’t have any more to sell into the market.While bitcoin was in sideways trading Monday climbing less than a percent, ether performed similarly, losing less than a percent as of 20:20 UTC (4:20 p.m. EDT).Over the weeked, both bitcoin and ether trended upward, above their 10-day and 50-day moving average technical indicators. Although ether slipped a bit in 24-hour trading Monday, Rupert Douglas, head of institutional sales at digital asset management firm Koine remains bullish on both assets. “I think bitcoin and ether are about to rally,” he said. Read More: Bitcoin Hits Highest Level Since Black Thursday Amid Halving BuzzDigital assets on CoinDesk’s big board had mixed performances Monday.

California ...","Apr 22, 2020 at 17:22 UTC","Stablecoin issuances do not push up the price of bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, according to research funded by University of California Berkeley’s Haas Blockchain Initiative. ","In their report, issued Friday, Richard Lyons, U.C. Berkley’s chief innovation and entrepreneurship officer, and Ganesh Viswanath-Natraj, assistant professor of finance at the Warwick Business School, found stablecoins serve as tools for investors to react to market movements and not as drivers of price inflation or collapse. Their analysis of trading data shows flows are consistent with investors using stablecoins as a store of value during periods of risk or price depreciation.Lyons and Viswanath-Natraj also found “strong evidence” of another catalyst for flows from issuer treasuries to secondary markets: arbitrage trading when stablecoins deviate from their pegs.Whether stablecoin issuances materially affect the price of cryptocurrencies is no small controversy. In July 2018, research published by John Griffins of the University of Texas at Austin and Amin Shams of the Ohio State University concluded stablecoin issuances “are timed following market downturns and result in sizable increases in bitcoin prices.” The research further claimed that stablecoin flows and subsequent price inflation during 2017 were attributable to a single entity.Four months after the Griffins and Shams study was released, the U.S. Department of Justice opened an investigation into whether Tether and Bitfinex have used stablecoin issuances to inflate the price of bitcoin. A related class-action lawsuit was filed against dominant stablecoin issuer Tether and its sister company, Bitfinex, in late 2019. The claimants alleged Bitfinex and Tether ""monopolized and conspired to monopolize the bitcoin market,"" as well as manipulated the market via stablecoin issuance among other things. A pseudonymous online firebrand known as Bitfinex'd made similar claims about the companies in a series of detailed blog posts several years ago.Directly contradicting Griffin and Shams, Lyons and Viswanath-Natraj summarize their conclusions by saying: “We find no systematic evidence that stablecoin issuance affects cryptocurrency prices. Rather, our evidence supports alternative views; namely, that stablecoin issuance endogenously responds to deviations of the secondary market rate from the pegged rate, and stablecoins consistently perform a safe-haven role in the digital economy.”The industry’s aggregate stablecoin supply has passed $9 billion at the time of writing, according to data from CoinMetrics. At bitcoin’s all-time high in Q4 2017, aggregate stablecoin supply was just over $1.25 billion.

","European markets saw gains, with the FTSE Eurotop 100 index closing in the green 1.9 percent, driven by oil-related stocks. The S&P 500 index also ended the day on the plus side, up 2.2 percent. Meanwhile, U.S. Treasury bonds sold off slightly as traders were willing to take on a little bit more risk in the equities market. Yields on the two-year, the 10-year and the 30-year Treasury bonds all rose (bond yields rise as prices fall). The yield on the 10-year climbed highest, to 6 percent at 20:30 UTC (4:30 p.m. EDT) Wednesday.Despite Wednesday’s uptick, crude is not out of the woods. “Although OPEC production cuts are expected to kick off in May, weak demand and high global inventory mean that oil prices remain under pressure,” said Nemo Qin, senior analyst for multi-asset brokerage eToro. The price of bitcoin climbed 3.4 percent over the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index as of 20:30 UTC (4:30 p.m. EDT) Wednesday.After starting at midnight UTC around $6,800, bitcoin saw some buying on spot exchanges like Coinbase. That pushed its prices above $7,000, breaking higher than its 10-day and 50-day moving averages, a bullish signal for those who follow technical analysis. It’s just about more buyers but perhaps fewer sellers in the cryptocurrency ahead of the expected May halving event. “With the bitcoin halving fast approaching, where miners will see the amount of bitcoin mined from each node reduced by 50 percent, it could be that investors are choosing not to sell their holdings as we might expect,”  said Simon Peters, another analyst at eToro. “Instead, they are staying in bitcoin so as not to miss out on the anticipated gains in the months following the halving.”Read more: Bitcoin Halving, ExplainedDigital assets are up on CoinDesk’s big board for the day. Ether (ETH) climbed  6 percent. The biggest winners today include dash (DASH) up 7.6 percent, stellar (XLM) gaining 6.9 percent and cardano (ADA) in the green 5 percent. All price changes are as of 20:45 UTC (4:45 p.m. EDT) Wednesday.Despite security concerns in the Ethereum-backed decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, the price of ether continues to perform well, trouncing bitcoin since the beginning of the year, according to data from aggregator Coin Metrics. Year to date, bitcoin is flat while ether has seen 30 percent gains. While ether’s prices have done remarkably well, Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem has been hit with smart contract security problems. That includes the bZx “flash loans” hack in February, when a hacker was able to drain $350,000 from the Fulcrum lending platform. In addition, more recently, the dForce protocol saw $25 million in crypto drained from the Lendf.me lending platform which was 99 percent of its total balance, although that attacker soon returned most of the funds.It’s hard to place blame on protocols, says Neeraj Khandelwal, Co-founder of India-based exchange CoinDCX. “The latest news on DeFi’s security flaws have to do with the construction of the architecture on top of Ethereum, and not to do with the Ethereum protocol itself. As such, I do not expect the flaws of a limited number of DeFi projects to affect the price of ETH.""“The so-called security flaws are merely structural decisions that DeFi companies are making and not indicative of Ethereum itself,” according to Alexander Blum, Co-founder of Two Prime, a crypto asset management firm.Companies, not protocols, are causing problems with DeFi, and Blum made a comparison to the critical web protocol HTTP - it has been hacked as well, usually due to bad security practices by organizations that cause issues. “Just like how we wouldn't dismiss the entire HTTP protocol due to the hacking of a single website, it will be misplaced to deem Ethereum unsafe and insecure simply based on the flaws of DeFi companies.” Ethereum as a cryptocurrency computing platform isn’t the only one suffering from hacks. The Factom protocol, a smaller rival to Ethereum, this week fell victim to a $11 million hack of stablecoin platform PegNet. Insiders have said the Factom PegNet hack looks similar to the Ethereum-based dForce attack, a sign hackers can be protocol agnostic with their tactics.  See also: Ethereum Now Matches Bitcoin on One Key MetricDeFi’s travails most likely doesn’t have an affect on ether’s price performance. Liquidity on exchanges, and not protocol fundamentals, could be ether’s key feature for traders. “Ether and bitcoin have many similar attributes: easily accessible and tradable on global exchanges everywhere, used heavily for trading pairs, very little friction with cross-border trading, deemed not equities by the SEC,” said Coin DCX's Khandelwal. ""Their values — and in turn, their prices — aren’t necessarily tied to their technical attributes.” Gold also bounced higher Wednesday, with buying volume of the yellow metal keeping its price above $1,700. “Gold prices are expected to be pushed higher due to investors flocking toward safe-haven assets,” said Nemo Qin, Senior Analyst eToro. “We can expect to see gold and gold-backed investments to continue to grow in 2020.”In Asia the Nikkei 225 dropped, although only less than a percent, in daily trading as Tokyo’s transportation and real estate sectors were hit with big losses on Wednesday.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

70,www.coindesk.com,,Dutch Central Bank Wants to Be European Union's CBDC Proving Ground,https://www.coindesk.com/dutch-central-bank-wants-to-be-european-unions-cbdc-proving-ground,"The Dutch Central Bank (DNB) thinks the eurosystem's central bank digital 
currency (CBDC) should be more programmable than bitcoin.","Apr 21, 2020 at 19:16 UTC",The Dutch Central Bank (DNB) thinks the eurosystem’s central bank digital currency (CBDC) should be more programmable than bitcoin. ,"Saying on Tuesday that cryptocurrencies offer some technological lessons for the banks they seek to displace, DNB wrote that smart contracts could help “future proof” CBDCs. The 45-page CBDC report is the Netherlands' pitch to become a digital currency proving ground for the eurosystem.“A smart contract system with complex logic potentially increases the demand for CBDC and offers opportunities to reduce transaction costs,” DNB said. “In this way it could contribute to diversity and innovation in the payment market.”The striking admission comes as the DNB jockeys for influence in European central bankers’ growing digital currency debate. Just last month the French seized that discussion with an open call for limited CBDC experiments. The Netherlands, which does not have its own active experiment just yet, went a step further in the report: DNB wants to be a research, development and deployment hub for a European CBDC.“If the decision should be taken within the eurosystem to experiment with some more concrete type of CBDC, we are ready to play a leading role. The Netherlands provides a suitable testing ground for such an experiment,” DNB said.That appears to be an imperative for the Dutch, whose 17 million residents are the least likely in the eurozone to pay for goods or services with cash, according to a 2017 European Union report. Three years later Holland’s cash aversion has only come into stronger focus: there are fewer ATMs and fewer cash withdrawals each year. On a macro scale, “private digital money” use – private money being funds tied to a commercial bank account – is growing and Libra, though neutered, is still a threat.Responding as well to what it said was its own citizens’ growing interest in CBDC, the DNB said digital currency could help ensure that public money stays alive in a digital future. The report offers a detailed look at what a “reasonable” eurozone CBDC could be and compares the choices against some monetary benchmarks: Libra, bitcoin, cash, commercial bank money and central bank reserves. “After 10 years of experimenting with private cryptos, the question is whether some techniques have sufficient added value for use in CBDC,” DNB mulled. It concluded that smart contracts may be the only “technique” worth salvaging, in part because its future-forward flexibility could make CBDC more in demand.It indicated that CBDC should be more programmable to bitcoin and second only to libra. DNB divorced smart contacts from another less desirable hallmark feature of cryptocurrency: distributed ledger technology (DLT). DNB roundly rejected DLT as a feature coined by idealists working outside the banking system.“The fully decentralized solution of, for example, bitcoin, with decentralized validation, was partly ideologically driven,” DNB said as it argued against bitcoin’s resource-intensive and potentially cumbersome model of distributed consensus. “It seems unnecessary for CBDC to make those sacrifices.”Even so, DNB embraced the need for some anonymity that bitcoin evangelists and cash stalwarts adore. DLT makes bitcoin transaction history completely transparent even while offering users a means to transact pseudonymously. Conversely, commercial banks, who have full knowledge of their users’ transaction history, have a market incentive to sell data that central banks do not. DNB therefore said that a CBDC should offer a selective degree of privacy second only to wholly anonymous cash.Those technical aspects and more build out DNB’s uncannily detailed envisioning of CBDC. Coming also with DNB’s emphatic call for CBDC to shore up the public money system as the world continues to change, it amounts to a striking endorsement of CBDC – perhaps, as the Dutch Finance Minister Wopke Hoekstra told parliament Tuesday, the loudest in Europe so far.“In no other euro area has the central bank so clearly expressed a positive attitude towards digital central bank money aimed at the general public,” Hoekstra said.“The ball is now” in the eurosystem’s court, he said.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Overstock’s security token trading subsidiary is hoping to become the first to break that ground. tZERO Crypto is tZERO’s noncustodial exchange app supporting bitcoin, ethereum and ravencoin. It is currently separate from tZERO’s digital securities trading platform the tZERO Alternative Trading System (ATS).The securities tZERO wants to trade are still recorded on a traditional central ledger, but a blockchain platform is used to act as a backup record.Connecting tZERO Crypto’s fast-growing but relatively meager use base – the app had 6,404 accounts in Q1, a 40 percent increase over the previous quarter – to the tZERO ATS would potentially increase liquidity in a security token market that acutely lacks intraday trading volume. On Thursday, tZERO ATS’ two listed security tokens, OSTKO and TZROP, changed hands 73 and 4,835 times, respectively, on tZERO’s broker-dealer partner platform Dinosaur Financial. In comparison, Overstock’s OSTK shares traded 10.5 million times on Nasdaq Thursday.See Also: Vertalo, tZERO Are Bringing $300M in Real Estate to the Tezos BlockchaintZERO Crypto’s cohesive trading platform would run on a yet-to-be-approved subsidiary broker-dealer, tZERO Markets. The firm's CEO, Saum Noursalehi, had previously targeted the first half of 2020 for tZERO Markets’ launch and repeated Thursday that he expected a verdict in Q2 – “but you can never be sure with regulators.”“Once we receive regulatory approval, our app will trade cryptocurrencies, security tokens (including TZROP and OSTKO), and traditional stocks,” Noursalehi told CoinDesk. “The value of the crypto app users will grow as we add the capability to trade securities on it.""Linking tZERO Crypto to tZERO ATS is one of many user acquisition strategies. Previous growth gambits appear to be working. That includes Overstock’s flashiest: the upcoming digital security shareholder dividend, a plan – designed by former CEO Patrick Byrne – to plug thousands of Overstock shareholders into the tZERO ATS by wooing them onto Dinosaur Financial with a company security token, OSTKO.See Also: Patrick Byrne, Cryptocurrency Champion, Resigns as Overstock CEONoursalehi told CoinDesk that “Dino has seen a notable increase in investor onboarding” ahead of the May 19 dividend payday, though he declined to state how many had signed up. Dino is the only broker-dealer approved to run tZERO ATS out of the six broker-dealers subscribed.The digital dividend has prompted new broker-dealers to approach tZERO ATS, Noursalehi said. He said tZERO is in talks with about 100 broker-dealers. tZERO is betting that it can bring more investors onto its ATS by giving them more digital securities to trade. Only two tokens are currently listed but a third is waiting for regulators’ OK, and some 200 other companies are in “late-stage” discussions to issue digital securities with tZERO ATS.“We believe that as we get more assets trading, it will attract interest from other investors,” Noursalehi said. “In particular, as existing digital securities move onto our platform, all of the investors that hold those securities will onboard and become our customers."" COVID-19 has slowed tZERO’s march. In the earnings call, Noursalehi said the coronavirus and its ensuing market volatility has made new issuers hesitant to jump in until trading cools down to a more regular clip.“Issuers have largely sidelined trading existing digital securities until market conditions normalize, so tZERO has seen a slowdown in issuers looking to raise capital.

trend ...","Apr 21, 2020 at 17:00 UTC","Nearly $1 million in bitcoin and ethereum flowed into child pornography-linked wallet addresses in 2019, continuing a multiyear upward trend that captures the complicated realities of mass crypto adoption.","The statistic, disclosed in a Tuesday blog post by forensics firm Chainalysis, is a tiny sliver of overall crypto usage – even on March 31, 2019, one of the slower trading days of that year, Messari’s estimated $128 million worth of bitcoin in transit dwarfed the nearly $930,000 that Chainalysis traced to addresses flagged by the Internet Watch Foundation across 365 days.But the troubling total nonetheless documents crypto’s growing popularity as a method of payment for child sexual abuse material (CSAM). Last year, 32 percent more crypto value moved into CSAM than in 2018, which itself was 212 percent higher than 2017’s total. Chainalysis based its totals on the cryptos’ value at time of transaction.The 2019 figure comes in spite of law enforcement agencies’ global rush to dismantle online CSAM operations, including some of the largest ever uncovered. March 2018’s cross-border takedown of the Welcome to Video CSAM ring shuttered a darknet site that had collected some 420 total bitcoin across its nearly three-year reign.While Welcome to Video’s downfall did not stop 2018 or 2019 from hitting record usage highs, it does illustrate one of the upsides – from a law enforcement standpoint – of people using crypto to pay for CSAM. Bitcoin and ether are inherently traceable, and when users pay for CSAM without attempting to thoroughly obfuscate their tracks, they’re surprisingly easy to find and jail.Most of the funds come right from exchanges, said Nina Heyden, an economist at Chainalysis. Better yet: from compliant exchanges who collect their users’ identity data as required by law. “The good thing about that is those exchanges often cooperate with law enforcement when law enforcement requests more information during investigations,” Heyden said.For example, law enforcement used crypto tracing software to arrest hundreds of Welcome to Video customers whose transaction trails often led to identifiable exchange accounts. Tracing also helped investigators uncover other CSAM rings associated with Welcome to Video via its users’ wallet addresses, as with DarkScandals.

The breakdown is distributed by CoinDesk.NLW: Welcome back to The Breakdown. It is Wednesday, April 29th and today we are going to be talking about Lebanon, specifically the currency crisis overlapping a political crisis overlapping a larger economic crisis that is engulfing Lebanon and I think has relevance for how we understand the dollar in the world, the dollar's role in the world and the fallout from COVID-19. I wanted to bring this episode to you because I noticed last week Lebanon start to emerge in the crypto sphere and there were two contexts: The first was Dan Tapiero. He picked up on a piece by newsBTC noticing that Bitcoin seemed to be trading at fifteen thousand dollars in lebanon via localbitcoins.com which is a peer to peer platform for trading Bitcoin between people. He said the classic emerging market funding crisis was made worse by deflationary dollar peg that is breaking. Study this case as it will be modeled for other weak emerging markets. It will be a key part of the macro story behind the upcoming Bitcoin price rally. NewsBTC... They titled their article Bitcoin trades at 15 K in Lebanon amidst economic turmoil showing its real potential. That was part one of how this showed up on the Bitcoin radar. And of course you see Bitcoin trading at a seemingly 100% premium against what we were seeing it at. It's going to cause notice. The second context that Lebanon has had within the Bitcoin sphere, the Bitcoin Twittersphere, is images and videos of riots in Lebanon... Where protesters are smashing banks and setting fire to banks over the last two days. And that is happening, but it has a specific context and I think it's incredibly important to dig into this because this is not just a single country, this is a country that is representative of I think a number of potential challenges that a variety of huge emerging market contexts are going to face in the coming months and the coming years.And it deeply implicates the question of the role of the dollar in the world and the role of external currencies. So what I'm going to try to do today is give you a primer on how Lebanon got here, how this crisis happened, what this crisis means, and what the real implications are. Now, a couple caveats. First, I am obviously not a Lebanon expert. It is not my main field. It is not my main point of view and I have put this primer together humbly by doing my own research of the last six months of Lebanese political and economic turmoil. That said, I do have some context in this region. I first went to the middle East in 2004 to study in Cairo. I went back and forth a number of times, probably a dozen times over the course of the next five years or so.I thought that I was going to spend my life doing either Middle East conflict resolution or just conflict resolution more broadly and spent time all around the region, including in Lebanon and Syria. Again, this was a long time ago. I was in Lebanon last in 2006 and Syria last in 2006 as we know, those places are very different than they were then, but this is not a complete neophyte perspective. I guess I do have some time booked both in the region and spent looking at the history of the region. I'm not going to get too deep into history today. I'm really just going to focus on what's been happening over the last six months and put it in the larger global economic context we have. Here's the TLDR on this. This is not a story of Bitcoin trading at a premium because people are desperate to get into Bitcoin.This is a story of a local currency failing and people trying to find any on-ramp to access any US dollars that they can. That's the real story and that's the important piece of this conversation. Let's do a little bit of Lebanon economic basics first. A key thing to note is that this is a country where almost everything consumed is imported. That's a really important note because as we'll see, imports are purchased with dollars and then sold for Lebanese Lira. Even before all of this happened, Lebanon had a huge debt to GDP ratio, one of the worst in the country between 150% to 170% debt to GDP ratio. This is a country that borrows a lot. It has had a dollar peg since 1997 of approximately 1500 Lira to one US Dollar. It has had a dollar peg since 1997 of 1500 Lebanese pounds or Lira to one USD.An article in the New York times described this rate thusly, they said, ""but maintaining that rate required continually bringing new dollars into the country, usually by enticing wealthy investors to make large dollar deposits for high interest rates. A strategy that some economists have compared to a Ponzi scheme."" We'll get into this more in the banking system more in a minute. But the key part for our purposes is that since 1997 the dollar has been pegged 1500 Lebanese pounds to one US dollar and it's been maintained through central bank policy. This is an economy that is 70% dollarized and it has only been sustainable because of diaspora inflows back to the country. So a huge number of Lebanese depositing money into the Lebanese banking system from abroad as well as from inflows from other regions. So Lebanese banks have attracted huge foreign inflows for years and years and years through offering high interest rates and basically that allows the country to pay for imports even though it has such low exports.So in this way, the banking system is really key to the economy. The deposit base in fact in Lebanon is usually something like 2.5 to three times the size of the economy. However, the banking system is hugely compromised right now. And this is not just a coronavirus thing. In fact, as you'll see, this story is not particularly a coronavirus issue, although as with everywhere else, the coronavirus shutdowns have exacerbated the situation, so the banking system is compromised. 70% of assets are lent to the state itself, but government bonds are trading 40 to 50 cents on the dollar. Of those 30% of loans that are to the private sector, 25% of those are non-performing. And what that means when you add everything up from the central bank balance sheet is that half of the assets of banks are impaired. They're problematic. This could be okay in some short term way if there were still huge inflows from abroad into the banking system, but there haven't been in the same way because of regional turmoil.There is the obvious crisis of the war in Syria, which has been ongoing and dragging the entire region down. There is trouble with Iran who basically uses Hezbollah to meddle in Lebanon's affairs and has for decades. There is a crisis with the relationship with Saudi Arabia, which went really bad in 2017 to say the least and I will point you to more resources to learn about that, but when that relationship went bad, we saw some of the first gasps of dollar outflows in late 2017 1.5% of cash deposits were withdrawn from the Lebanese banking system in fear of what that regional turmoil might do. So effectively we have a very unstable economy that is largely propped up by a robust banking sector that has been attractive to both foreign Lebanese as well as to the region for years, but as political crisis engulfs the region and compromises that banking system, it makes the system of continued inputs very compromised.And so this is the context for where we started to see real problems happen last year. The center, underlying problem which metastasizes and metastasizes in this situation is not enough dollars to keep this economy going. As I was mentioning before, if you have a net import economy that uses dollars and your local currency interchangeably, what happens is that all of those purchases of imports happen in dollars, right? If the U S is sending wheat or anything else to you, it's going to bill you in dollars, not in Lebanese pounds, but then your local market, your local consumer base, uses those Lebanese pounds to buy that good. The peg keeps that system working, but if the peg starts to break, it can deteriorate incredibly quickly. Keep in mind as well that there is a dollar shortage around the world. This is not a Lebanon unique situation.The U S dollar has been the strongest and clearest asset, the world's global reserve currency, not just theoretically, but in a way that is profound for a long time. And so imagine the pressure of trying to get dollars everywhere, but manifested in a specific nation-context like Lebanon. That's what we've been dealing with. So last August the 1500 Lebanese pound to us dollar peg started to break. In September, an economic state of emergency was declared and the government actually used WhatsApp to say that they plan to raise taxes to cover government expenditures. This sparked protests because there was already a lot of questions around the legitimacy of government and corruption in government. So when the government said that they were going to come seize citizen money through taxes, basically to cover their expenditures, there was a wave of protests. This was exacerbated in October. On October 11th there was a nationwide strike demanding the ability to pay for fuel imports in Lira, in Lebanese pounds rather than dollars. A sign seen on Twitter said, we apologize to the Lebanese people due to the lack of dollars to buy fuel.“We are closing our petrol station until we can secure this product in Lebanese pounds.” So again, this is the situation we were just describing. Petrol station owners sell their fuel in Lebanese pounds, but have to buy it in US dollars from importers. This also happened to mill owners. People who are bakers who buy imported wheat in US dollars. What happens of course, is that as the peg starts to come undone, that itself creates more demand for dollars, which causes the peg to come further undone. So put yourself in the situation of your average Lebanese person. You're seeing these strikes around fuel importers around bakeries who aren't able to get the dollars they need to buy the imports that allow their businesses to work. You're an average citizen. You say, well, damn, if there's dollar shortages, I need to go get my dollars out, which causes a run on the bank.Banks start to limit withdrawals, which is exactly what happened. Banks started to limit how much could be withdrawn in USD and that creates more demand for dollars. All of a sudden that activity moves to the black markets because if banks won't allow people to withdraw money or get access to dollars, black markets will, but the black market price is not going to stay the same as that official peg. This keeps going on. As people start to see the peg fall further, they want to minimize loss. They go from, ""I don't want to lose the value that I would have had at that official peg going on the black market"" to ""The black markets, the only place I can get those dollars, if it's 2000 Lebanese pounds to the dollar, now, I want to lock in that loss rather than worry or take the risk of a loss of greater debasement of the value of the Lebanese pound in months to come.So it's a very vicious cycle. So, big protests start in October. Prime minister resigns at the end of October. Protests continue through November. Fast forward to February, early March... GDP is down from 55 billion to 44 billion. 220,000 jobs in a country of 5 million are lost between October to February. Food prices are up 58% and key parts of the industry are just totally left shuttered. So this is a quote from an article. Importers of critical goods such as medical supplies, say their requests for dollars have gone almost entirely unmet since February. Leaving many hospitals dangerously low on everything from heart stents to dialysis equipment on March 7th an extraordinary thing happens for the first time Lebanon defaults on a foreign currency debt payment. This is one thing that was holding Lebanon together is that it had a relatively high standing in foreign markets because it didn't do things like default on debt payments.It did in March for the first time and then COVID-19 hits and the economy is locked down since the middle of March, which is just pouring gasoline on an absolute dumpster fire already. So let's look again at what's happening in the currency markets as this foreign currency default happens in the beginning of March, the official exchange rate remains at 1500 Lebanese pounds to the dollar, but on the black market, money changers are getting 2,500 pounds to the dollar. There are a growing wave of people who are extremely worried, right? Think about middle-class Lebanese who are paid in Lebanese pounds, but who owe tuition or mortgages that are denominated in dollars. It's the story that we hear over and over again in dollar denominated debt. No one can get dollars to bring in goods from abroad. So businesses are shuttering and to make matters worse, and this is how these economic crises play out.Lebanese banks, which are terrified of bank runs, are continuing to reduce how much people can actually take out of their accounts and they're doing so with caps, they are setting the exchange rate price lower than what the black market is saying. Then we get to April and things get really bad. The official peg is still at 1500 but it's gone to 3,500 in black markets. A few weeks into April bank start making some small concession. They allow small depositors to cash out dollar savings, but at 2,600 pounds, so this is obviously more than the 1500 but way less than the 3,500 pounds that the black market was saying a dollar was worth. The blame game heats up between the prime minister and the central bank governor in a televised speech, the prime minister said the central bank is either incapable, absent, or directly inciting this dramatic depreciation.There's clear politicking involved in, like I said at the beginning, there's so much to Lebanese politics that I can't get into it now, but it's worth looking into, but there's credence for these accusations, at least in the context of regular citizens and protestors because the Lebanese bank has at this time been trying to buy up all the dollars they can from money transfer companies at a rate of 3,625 Lebanese pounds to the dollar. So in short, the Lebanese bank is trying to buy as many dollars as they can get their hands on at a rate that's much higher than the exchange rate that they're allowing Lebanese citizens to withdraw at, which is obviously going to cause incredible foment. There's no way that people are going to just let that pass, especially when the prime minister is saying that the central bank governor is to blame for this crisis, which brings us to this week and the videos and images you've seen on Twitter of banks burning around Lebanon.Aljazeera called this the night of the Molotov and for the last two nights at least a dozen Lebanese banks have been torched, vandalized as part of this growing frustration. Effectively these protests are now turning violent because the desperation is getting to reach a fever pitch with no end, no clear plan in sight. Even before all this, it was estimated that poverty was around 50% in the country at the beginning of the year. Now, the social affairs minister of the country is estimating that some 75% of the population require aid. Meanwhile, the economy, what's left of it is still shut down because of the coronavirus. That's where we are now. We have a crisis in freefall which has lost at least 50% of its value against the dollar and realistically more since the middle of last year with a rate of descent that is increasing.We have a political instability where an already compromised and unloved government is blaming the central bank for this machination. We have an economic system that's based not on economic fundamentals but financial engineering that requires an ever growing influx of foreign investment, foreign currency into the system that once that dries up just shuts down. All told what you have is that complete currency collapse and by extension economic collapse of a nation that has at times been one of the bright lights of a very troubled region. Let's return back to the article that got Bitcoin's attention in the first place. This idea that Bitcoin was trading at 15,000 Lira in Lebanon amidst economic turmoil showing its real potential. The article was based on the sell price on local bitcoins.com of a Bitcoin going for as high as 22,678,227.03 Lebanese pounds per token. If you divide that by the official expressed Lebanese pound to dollar rate, which is 1500 you get this 15,000 number.That's where it comes from. It is factoring in or it is assuming that the exchange rate of 1500 is the actual exchange rate. As we've discussed, the real exchange rate in Lebanon right now is somewhere between 2,600 which is what the banks are offering people to withdraw there. Lebanese pounds at or 3,600 which is what the central bank is paying for dollars on the open markets and what Lebanese are paying in the black markets. When you divide this offer of 22 million Lebanese pounds per Bitcoin by those numbers, you get a number that looks pretty much exactly like what Bitcoin was selling for everywhere else. Does this mean that we shouldn't see Bitcoin as an interesting, relevant asset for this region? Should we dismiss this idea that it is ""showing its real potential?"" My answer is ""absolutely not"", but we have to understand how Bitcoin and other digital assets are functioning in the real world right now.The story of Lebanon that I've just told, which is the very TL;DR version is a story where people don't have control over their money. Their money is predicated on a banking system that has its own interests, its own machinations, its own incentives that for a while aligned with theirs. But as soon as it didn't, shut down their ability to actually control their wealth and effectively enabled their wealth to be reduced by a factor of 50% in the course of just a few months. Imagine that you had been saving in a bank doing what you're supposed to do, being a good citizen, putting away your money for years and years and years and over six months. It's cut in half simply by the debasement of the currency. That's what we saw. What Bitcoin is reflective of and how people are using it in this crisis is trying to escape a local monetary regime that is crumbling.What the world is doing though, and I think that we have to expect this is going to be the case for some time, is they're escaping, not into Bitcoin per se, but the dollar. The dollar is the world's escape valve currency. Even in Lebanon, before this turmoil, the whole system was predicated on being able to move easily into the dollar. The problem is that as the dollar becomes the only asset for the entire world, there's a shortage of them and it becomes harder and harder to get into the dollar. Now, the interesting thing is as we watch the total circulating supply of USD based stable coins rise, I think that's part and parcel of this as well. It is people trying to get dollar exposure and escape from local monetary regimes by accessing the digital currency world. This is not a diminishment of Bitcoin, but we also need to be clear that it's not some super premium because Lebanese who are desperate are trying to get into this new currency.Lebanese who are desperate are trying to get to the currency that they've always used to actually pay the key debts that they have, which is dollars. We live in a dollar denominated debt world until that is no longer the case, part of Bitcoin's role is going to be to help people escape out of these local monetary regimes, which are collapsing and get money to where it needs to be into different currencies. Even synthetic ones. I don't think that's a knock on Bitcoin. I think it's in fact an affirmation of its power as an uncontrollable non-sovereign currency. But we have to speak about what is actually true, not just go for the headline. So hopefully this has been an interesting or enlightening look at what's going on in Lebanon. As I said, I am not a Lebanese expert. I put this together on the basis of just my own research and reading, but I fear that it is reflective of a lot of places we're going to see around the world that face this same perfect storm of a bad local monetary regime and currency crisis that ensues, a shortage of dollars that makes it worse and the lack of a fundamental basis for the economy that can solve it.Anyways, guys, let me know what you thought about this episode. Hit me up @NLW on Twitter and if you liked it, share and subscribe. Let me know because this is a little bit of a departure, although to me, I think this is the type of issue that is sort of the most important for us to really, really understand.

Researchers at Kaspersky and EY have said enterprise blockchains may be walled-off but they are easily penetrated. Here's the story: Deposing BanksThe Bitfinex crypto exchange is making a new push to find and potentially recover more than $800 million in user funds seized by legal authorities in four different countries after its payment processor’s bank accounts were frozen. iFinex Inc., Bitfinex's parent firm, applied for subpoenas in Colorado, Arizona and Georgia this month, asking federal courts to aid it in deposing banks that may have held funds for Crypto Capital, the payment processor on which Bitfinex stored customers’ and exchange funds. Emerging MarketCitizens in the Middle East are turning to crypto – from bitcoin to stablecoins – to resist the effects of weak governments and wildly fluctuating exchange rates. CoinDesk’s Leigh Cuen weighs in on the phenomenon as part of a three-part column on how cryptocurrencies are used in the developing world, leading up to her “Crypto Across Emerging Markets” panel at Consensus: Distributed.Enterprise RisksEnterprise-grade private blockchains, the supposedly more efficient sister to public chains, are vulnerable to denial of service attacks and insider threats, according to researchers at Kaspersky and EY. “Open source code that isn’t widely used and doesn’t have a vigilant community testing and inspecting it is far less secure and reliable than systems like Bitcoin and Ethereum, which are continuously hardened by nearly constant attack and public inspection,” said Paul Brody, EY's global blockchain lead.  Blockchain VotingThe Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, a U.S. Senate subcommittee unit, floated blockchain voting as a way to keep the chamber legislating through crises. “The Senate may consider blockchain” if its 100 members must vote remotely, staffers wrote. It also proposed voting on end-to-end encryption platforms and via a military-esque “air-gapped” communications system akin to those presidents and generals use.Fraud Ruling A New Jersey judge dismissed a lawsuit against Riot Blockchain, which alleged the firm committed securities fraud by changing its name to ""Riot Blockchain"" in an effort to boost its share price.Restricted AccessJapan has amended the way cryptocurrencies are regulated within the country, prompting BitMEX to begin restricting access to local residents, the exchange announced last week.New Collateral?MakerDAO may collaterialize tBTC, an Ethereum-based token pegged to bitcoin. Though the token is expected to launch in mid-May, Matt Luongo, tBTC’s creator, proposed the move Sunday on MakerDAO’s forum.

On-chain data suggests both small and large investors are accumulating coins in the run-up to the event. As a result, a bout of profit taking may be seen after May 12. Some investors, especially short-term traders, may sell their coins after halving, putting downside pressure on prices.Public InterestBitcoin is up 21% in 2020 to about $8,600, during a time when the pandemic laid bare some of the structural vulnerabilities of the post-Bretton Woods monetary system.

million helping the bitcoin warehouse acquire loyalty rewards ...","Apr 30, 2020 at 16:17 UTC","Intercontinental Exchange, the parent company to Bakkt, spent close to $300 million helping the bitcoin warehouse acquire loyalty rewards provider Bridge2 Solutions, CEO Jeffrey Sprecher said Thursday.","The revelation came during a discussion of the financial strength of ICE, the parent company to several major trading venues, include the New York Stock Exchange.Sprecher said during ICE's Q1 earnings call the company had ""opportunistically repurchased shares,"" spending $300 million at $92 per share during the quarter while maintaining the company's leverage, measured as the ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBIDTA). ""We also spent nearly $300 million helping Bakkt to acquire Bridge2 solutions,"" Sprecher said. ""Yet, our leverage was still at 2.3 times which is a complete testament to the strength of the cash flows of this business.""Bakkt announced it would acquire Bridge2 in February, while simultaneously raising a $300 million Series B funding round. The round closed last month, as did the acquisition. The terms of the deal were outlined in ICE's quarterly filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, also released Thursday. See Also: Bakkt Raises $300M Series B From Microsoft, PanteraIt's unclear whether the $300 million represents the total sum of the acquisition or how much came from Bakkt's Series B funders, which include Microsoft's M12, PayU, Boston Consulting Group, Goldfinch Partners, CMT Digital and Pantera Capital. The company did say in its February press release that some of the funds from the round would go toward the acquisition. Aside from two references to Bridge2, Bakkt was not mentioned during the earnings call. No analysts asked any direct questions about the subsidiary, which has been facilitating trading of bitcoin futures and options contracts over the past several months. Nor were there any questions about Mike Blandina, who stepped down as Bakkt's CEO last week just four months after taking the reins. Blandina was succeeded on an interim basis by ICE's vice president for M&A and integration, David Clifton. There has so far been no word a permanent replacement CEO. The lack of questions comes in stark contrast to ICE's last earnings call in February, when a number of analysts asked about ICE's role with Bakkt. That call came right after ICE announced it was acquiring Bridge2, and Sprecher said at the time the move could open a potential $1 trillion market.Bakkt is working on its consumer-focused app. The company has rolled out an integration with Starbucks, allowing some of the coffee chain's app users to pay for caffeine using ""Bakkt Cash.""

the exchange rates for both bitcoin and ether against the U.S. dollar.","Apr 24, 2020 at 08:43 UTC","With around a billion dollars sitting in decentralized finance (DeFi) apps and protocols, Coinbase has started to provide a data feed for cryptocurrency prices to help keep those funds secure.","Available from Thursday, the San Francisco crypto exchange said the feed, or oracle, provides data from Coinbase Pro on the exchange rates for both bitcoin and ether against the U.S. dollar. It is further signed with Coinbase's private key, meaning that when shared across third party services and protocols, the data can always be verified as being from the exchange.Coinbase Oracle can be pulled in by blockchain networks and, once there, can be married with other data feeds for use by in DeFi projects to carry out functions such as lending, margin trading, collateral liquidations and derivatives, Coinbase said in a blog post. The new offering is aimed at helping counter the dangers encountered when DeFi protocols using off-chain third-party data, which requires trust the prices being provided are accurate. The firm also points to the risks of using data from decentralized exchanges. That has already led to new kinds of attacks, such as those that hit ethereum-based lending project BZX in February when bad actors manipulated price feeds to make off with around $1 million in ether.See also: Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About the DeFi ‘Flash Loan’ Attack""A highly reliable price feed anchored into Coinbase’s secure infrastructure can help make the DeFi ecosystem safer, reduce systemic risks and unlock the next wave of growth and adoption,"" according to the post.The oracle is being supported by the same secure key storage infrastructure that supports Coinbase's exchange operations, storing billions in user funds. It further offers protection against manipulation of prices by exchanges or invalid data.Last year, Bitwise Asset Management issued a report claiming 95 percent of all reported bitcoin trading volume is faked. In such a market, reliable sources of price data are essential for automated protocols that hold sway over users' funds.“Coinbase Oracle will increase the security and decentralization of Compound’s price feed, which is mission-critical to the protocol and the ecosystem of applications built on top of Compound,"" said Robert Leshner, CEO at Compound, provider of an autonomous, algorithmic interest rate protocol for financial apps. ""We’re not alone – the rest of DeFi will benefit with faster development, consistent data, and shared standards.”See also: Crypto Lender Celsius Taps Chainlink’s Price Oracles for Interest Rate ‘Decentralization’In the blog post, Coinbase delved a little into the technical side of the new oracle, saying it is provided via an API compatible with Open Oracle – an open-source set of Ethereum smart contracts originally developed by Compound to help standardize and increase interoperability between different sources of oracle price data.Projects using Open Oracle are able to select the included feeds they want included in the calculation of an average price returned by the oracle contract. To help ensure this median is accurate, Coinbase designed its feed to have three ""layers"" of protection, including data quality arising from Coinbase Pro's high liquidity platform, an off-chain filter that blocks crypto asset price data points that significantly deviates from the expected volatility, and on-chain filtering via Open Oracle’s DelFiPrice smart contract. The latter again rejects price data points that significantly deviate from the last reported price from so-called ""anchor sources.""

have been extremely cautious in allowing banks to touch cryptocurrencies.","May 5, 2020 at 14:26 UTC","Ajit Tripathi, a CoinDesk columnist, is an executive director at Binance and the crypto co-host of the Breaking Banks Europe podcast. Previously, he served as a Fintech Partner at ConsenSys and a co-founder of PwC’s U.K. Blockchain Practice. The opinions expressed here are his personal views.","The crypto community was remarkably prescient in its prognosis of how coronavirus was going to impact the global economy and society. Through the long months when political leaders and the World Health Organization (WHO) were reluctant to declare a global pandemic and take firm action, many well-known voices on Crypto Twitter, including @balajis, @naval, @twobitidiot and others, were predicting a repeat of Wuhan across the world. The WHO declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic almost three months after Crypto Twitter exploded in concern about Wuhan going into a full lockdown. In the U.K., where I live, Prime Minister Boris Johnson suggested Britain should take a different approach from the rest of the world and seek “herd immunity.” Crypto Twitter and Reddit challenged his claims vigorously. Such a stark difference between the dangerous nonchalance of the fiat world and the accurate prognosis of the crypto community says something about the mental makeup of people who’re drawn to crypto – curious, not satisfied with the status quo and more interested in possibility than in the current reality. See also: Money Reimagined: As Tech, Politics and COVID-19 Collide, a Global Reset LoomsHistorically, the journey of the crypto community through policy circles has not been easy. There has been a huge generation gap between the fearful Boomers that design markets and economies today, and often equally irrational bitcoin maximalists who dominate debate in the crypto community. In my own personal experience interacting with regulators around the world. Now, on-point, insightful voices like Chamath Palihapitiya and Balaji Srinivasan are finally being noticed in policy circles as providing a valuable perspective to challenge conventional wisdom and that simple shift will fundamentally change the discourse around crypto going forward. Historically regulators around the world have been extremely cautious in allowing banks to touch cryptocurrencies. Even in Switzerland, where crypto banks like SEBA and Sygnum have seen some traction, and in Germany, where more than 40 banks have sought crypto custodian licenses, Basel capital requirements for holding cryptocurrencies have been prohibitive. There’s been a presumption the post-Basel III  (i.e. post-2009) banking system is functioning well and the issues of the last financial crisis have been addressed. That means banks must avoid unfamiliar and volatile asset classes like cryptocurrencies. Now the COVID-19 bailout, and the repo crisis that preceded COVID-19, have shown that Basel III and IV did little more than shift systemic risk from the banking system to the shadow banking system. Everyone from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to macro investing legends like Ray Dalio have been humbled by this entirely white swan event. This newfound humility will lead to a reexamining of our reliance on complex mathematics to hide mountains of debt and the magic word “scarcity” will be back in fashion again. When banks go looking for scarce assets for the sake of long term stability of their balance sheets, most will choose gold but a significant number will choose digital gold – i.e. bitcoin.In March, a month before the U.K. economy locked down, the Bank of England released an exceptionally well crafted paper on the potential benefits of retail CBDC. As I wrote previously, retail CBDCs can have this “little guy bailout” feature of electronic payments systems built into them. Shortly thereafter, as if on a cue, several U.S. lawmakers tried hurriedly to include a digital dollar in the bailout bill. That measure, and others since, have failed, but suddenly a “digital dollar” is very much on the policy agenda. COVID-19, as unfortunate as the pandemic is, might have this one big positive, digital side effect. Historically, one of the strongest policy arguments against a retail CBDC has been that banks are the primary instrument of credit and monetary policy. A CBDC available to households might undermine banks in a time of crisis. However, this crisis has shown the brick and mortar banking system is rather ineffective in serving its social purpose – which is to maintain financial stability and thus promote broader economic welfare.  U.K. Chancellor (finance minister) Rishi Sunak has struggled to deliver a bailout targeted at the little guy mainly because banks have failed to deliver the funds to the intended recipients. As the Guardian reported recently, only one in five U.K. businesses that have formally applied for government-backed loans have been granted emergency funding during the COVID-19 lockdown. Tragically, it appears the program may be too slow in getting money out fast enough to support struggling firms.As we emerge from this lockdown in the next three to six months, it will be interesting to see if this inability of banks to bail out the little guy (or girl) will impose a direct political cost on politicians like Mr. Sunak and Mr. Johnson. If it does, one hopes that even opponents of retail CBDCs will give the idea strong consideration. Retail CBDCs always made sense and now the COVID crisis and the need to get people money quickly and directly has proved the case. Historically, cryptocurrency regulation around the world has been characterized by an inconsistent patchwork of reactive, state by state and country by country rules. For an industry built around an asset class that is designed for instant, global, internet-based transfer, this has been a minefield to navigate. In Western Europe, where most nations are now transposing the fifth money laundering directive (5MLD) into law, licensing and registration requirements are coming into force in a country-by-country manner. For example, Spain doesn’t yet formally regulate cryptocurrencies, whereas Germany now formally characterizes cryptocurrencies as a financial instrument indicating the European Union’s MiFID rules might govern cryptocurrency markets sooner rather than later. See also: Ajit Tripathi - 4 Reasons Central Banks Should Launch Retail Digital CurrenciesThen there are a number of minor and major country by country variations that require at least a PhD in Twitter law to navigate fully. This lack of regulatory harmonization might create interesting opportunities for some but it hurts the crypto industry as a whole by making it nearly impossible for innovators to scale crypto businesses globally. By bringing bitcoin and crypto assets firmly and positively into the policy and regulatory discourse, COVID-19 will sharply accelerate this drip feed of inconsistent regulation towards harmonized and integrated fiat and crypto markets. Some experts like Caitlin Long, who has led the charge in Wyoming to create a favorable environment for the crypto industry, believe such a shift will bring more institutional money into crypto. I feel that while an institutional wall of money will benefit our industry, what’s more important is that the road to cross-border, peer-to-peer electronic money might now have become shorter. And COVID-19, as unfortunate as the pandemic is, might have this one big positive, digital side effect. The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

CEO Jihan Wu is currently the registered representative, and Bitmain said it wanted to switch the registration to Liu to improve efficiency.The bureau had approved the registration switch on Jan. 2, but Zhan appealed the decision in February and asked the bureau to register him as the legal representative, a title he once held, instead. While the bureau did not register Zhan as the legal representative, its reversal of the change from Wu to Liu could be significant. In China, naming a legal representative is much more than a formality; usually the chairman or CEO, this person has broad powers to act on a company’s behalf.    “We deeply regret the decision and think the bureau has violated corporate laws, and our company’s autonomy via administrative measures,” Bitmain said in a statement the same day. Hong Kong-based Bitmain Technologies Limited, whose CEO is Wu, has the right to change its legal representative since it is the Beijing subsidiary’s sole shareholder, the company said.“We will file a lawsuit against the bureau to protect our company, shareholders and employees,” the company said in the statement.   Read more: How Was It Possible for Bitmain to Oust Its Largest Shareholder Overnight?The legal dispute is the latest chapter in Zhan’s ongoing struggle with Bitmain since his departure plotted by his fellow co-founder Wu last October. The two executives had sparred over various management issues as early as 2015. Two months after Zhan was exiled from Bitcoin, he filed a legal case in the Cayman Islands, where Bitmain’s parent holding entity is registered. He asked a court to void a decision allegedly passed at a shareholder meeting that significantly curtailed his voting power. In March, Zhan filed another lawsuit, this time in China, against Bitmain’s fully-owned subsidiary Fujian Zhanhua Intelligence Technologies and Beijing Bitmain Technologies as a related third party. The local court said the case was a dispute over “shareholder qualification confirmation” without giving further details. In the latest statement, Bitmain also accuses Zhan of disrupting daily business by drawing crowds close to the company’s offices, posing as its legal representative to transfer assets and sign contracts, dividing and threatening employees with false information and smearing the management team through media coverage.  A week before Zhan’s departure and the revelation of Bitmain’s internal power struggle, the company confidentially filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to go public. The application appears to be still in process. Bitmain’s competitor Canaan Creative went public in the U.S. last December, while another major Chinese miner maker Ebang filed with the SEC for a $100 million initial public offering this week. The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

closely. “The other stablecoins don't seem to have the same kind of inflows.","May 1, 2020 at 22:54 UTC",The Bitfinex crypto exchange is making a new push to find and potentially recover more than $800 million in user funds seized by legal authorities in four different countries after its payment processor’s bank accounts were frozen. ,"iFinex Inc., Bitfinex's parent firm, applied for subpoenas in Colorado, Arizona and Georgia this month, asking federal courts to aid it in deposing banks that may have held funds for Crypto Capital, the payment processor on which Bitfinex stored customers’ and exchange funds. An entity hoping to confirm bank records can apply for a subpoena as banks cannot usually share those documents without a court order.iFinex applied for a subpoena Tuesday to depose SunTrust Bank employees in Georgia. This follows a similar subpoena application to depose the Bank of Colorado earlier in April and ABT & Trust in Arizona. Bitfinex is looking for evidence to support its legal claims to about $880 million held in bank accounts in Poland, Lisbon, London and elsewhere that have been seized by authorities pursuing anti-money laundering criminal charges against Crypto Capital.Bitfinex’s application follows an initial subpoena request from October 2019, filed in California, where the exchange sought testimony from a former TCA Bancorp executive about Crypto Capital’s accounts. This subpoena was later granted. A federal judge likewise granted iFinex's application in Arizona, while a magistrate judge in Georgia asked the company to file a corporate disclosure statement first.“Crypto Capital used a bank account with Citibank, N.A. (‘Citibank’) to accept certain deposits from Applicant’s customers. The account was held in the name of ‘Global Trading Solutions, LLC,’” the filing in Arizona stated.See Also: Bitfinex Covered $850 Million Loss Using Tether Funds, NY Prosecutors AllegeBitfinex General Counsel Stuart Hoegner told CoinDesk the filings “are aimed squarely at obtaining further information” about the funds held by Crypto Capital.“As we have said before, Bitfinex is the victim of a fraud and is asserting its rights to funds taken by Crypto Capital through legal measures initiated in various countries,” he said through a spokesperson.Bitfinex and its sister firm, stablecoin operator Tether, are the subject of civil lawsuits and an investigation by the New York Attorney General's office alleging fraud and market manipulation.Tether has denied the allegations in public statements. It has also aggressively issued more tether (USDT) since the investigation began; about $80 million in new USDT virtual currency on Thursday alone. This raises the presumed market value of the currency to about $8 billion, an increase of about $2 billion over the last 40 days, according to the Whale Alert tracking service.“When you’re looking at big tether issuances like that, you should look at how other currencies are acting in the market,” said Bennett Tomlin, a bitcoin writer and researcher who has been following the case closely. “The other stablecoins don’t seem to have the same kind of inflows. And you will very rarely see tether redemptions. It almost always goes up. Because we know from their lawyers that it’s not fully backed, I’m generally skeptical of larger issuances of tether.”Bitfinex began to rely on Crypto Capital as other banking relationships deteriorated, the firm said in the Georgia filing. Banks have grown wary of facilitating trade in cryptocurrency for fear of running afoul of cross-border money laundering laws.However, the president of Crypto Capital, Ivan Manuel Molina Lee, was arrested by Polish authorities in October and charged with being a member of an international gang laundering up to 1.5 billion złoty or about $390 million “from illegal sources.” Authorities wrote that Molina Lee’s crimes included “laundering dirty money for Columbian drug cartels using a cryptocurrency exchange.” Federal prosecutors indicted a second principal of Crypto Capital, Oz Yosef, in October on charges of conspiracy to commit bank fraud, bank fraud and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business. Oz Yosef’s sister, Ravid, was also indicted on fraud charges connected to Crypto Capital but remains at large in Israel. See Also: Law Firm Representing Quadriga’s Ex-Users Want Info About ‘Shadow Bank’ Crypto CapitalCrypto Capital managed to stash Bitfinex reserves in banks across the world, according to Bitfinex’s application. “Crypto Capital subsequently transferred funds between and among various banks, including in Europe and the United States. In the U.S. alone, Applicant has information that Crypto Capital used accounts held not only at SunTrust, but also Bank of America, Bank of Colorado, Citibank, Enterprise Bank & Trust, HSBC, Stearns Bank, Wells Fargo, TD Bank, and US Bank,” Bitfinex said in its subpoena application. Bitfinex hopes to trace how Crypto Capital moved money from one bank account to another to bolster its ownership claims over funds once held by the processor, according to the filings. Doing so requires navigating the convoluted chain of account ownership, commingled funds and financial transfers Crypto Capital used to manage money, Bitfinex notes in the application. Polish banks held about $335 million in Bitfinex fiat currency reserves, while Portuguese banks held about another $218 million, according to the Georgia filing.Referring to statements made by Giancarlo Devasini, Bitfinex’s chief financial officer, the subpoena application said, “[F]rom approximately April to June 2018, Crypto Capital used a bank account ending in -9503 with Citibank to accept deposits from Applicant’s customers. The account was held in the name of Global Trading Solutions, LLC. Because the name of this LLC was similar to that of the entity that then owned Crypto Capital (Global Trade Solutions AG), Applicant believed the LLC to be an entity related to Crypto Capital.”Global Trading Solutions LLC is owned by Reggie Fowler, a former National Football League investor tied to Crypto Capital. Fowler was indicted one year ago on charges of bank fraud and operating an unlicensed money transmitting business.He rejected a plea deal earlier this year; a trial scheduled to begin Tuesday has been pushed to Jan. 11, 2021. A Department of Justice spokesperson said he did not know if the delay is related to the COVID-19 pandemic disrupting judicial schedules.Citibank in California told Bitfinex’s legal team Fowler opened a separate, personal Citibank banking account at the same time and funded it with a $200,000 deposit from an unknown source and two subsequent wire transfers totaling $4 million. The wire transfers came from Banco BPI, one of three Portuguese banks Crypto Capital used for Bitfinex accounts.While Crypto Capital was taking transfers from Bitfinex into one Citibank account, Fowler transferred $380,000 from his account to a SunTrust account, according to the subpoena application. See Also: Suit Alleging Tether and Bitfinex Manipulated Bitcoin Market Has Been RevisedLater, nearly $2 million of iFinex customer funds were transferred from the Citibank account to a Bank of Colorado account, Bitfinex said in the Colorado court filing. Citibank told Bitfinex that this Bank of Colorado account “is held in the name of Eligibility Criterion, an entity owned or controlled by Fowler. Moreover, the wire transfer instructions indicated these transfers were ‘Intercompany Transfers.’” according to the document. New York courts have enjoined the firms from further depleting their cash reserves and from transferring any of those cash reserves to company executives, and directed the firms’ executives to produce documents and information central to the attorney general’s investigation. The companies are fighting those disclosures in court, an act that the Attorney General’s office described as “deeply perverse.” Nikhilesh De contributed reporting.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

He is also the cofounder of Coin Metrics, a blockchain analytics startup.","In the Disney Pixar movie “WALL·E,” the eponymous robot hero trundles around an abandoned Earth, methodically compacting mounds of old garbage. The planet had become barren and sterile, covered in the residual detritus of rampant consumerism. If we’re not careful, most public blockchains will share the fate of WALL·E’s Earth, destined to become deserted repositories of ancient garbage: not with physical garbage but junk data, irrelevant, anachronistic and disused.See also: Nic Carter - Corporate America Knows the Bailout Is Baked InThere’s a lot at stake. Blockchains that welcome the “highly available generic database” use case will suffer one of two dismal fates: either nodes become practically impossible to run long term, or node operators will discard data, weakening immutability promises. While Bitcoin’s approach to constricted block space (and consequently higher fees) dis-incentivizes the insertion of arbitrary, non-transactional data on chain, other competitors insist on low fees, effectively subsidizing marginal usage. This has had visible effects already – and introduces long-term risks that will have to be reckoned with. To understand why using blockchains for storing arbitrary data is a bad idea, let us consider them in the abstract. A blockchain manages the continuous auction of block space to the public in exchange for fees (and a subsidy). Miners can claim these fees in exchange for constructing and ordering blocks. Transactors tolerate these fees because the blockchain generates strong settlement assurances that can’t be found elsewhere. The quality of these assurances is largely a function of security spend, which is itself constituted from fees and the subsidy. Fees arise from the interplay between a bounded quantity of block space and demand to use that block space. Lastly, remember that node operators are the ones bearing the costs of data being added to the chain. Any data added today is effectively an externality that node operators have to tolerate in perpetuity.So is a payload of data – a transaction – an asset or a liability? It depends. I’d venture that a transaction is an asset to the blockchain if two conditions hold:That transactions should contribute to security spend is obvious. That they should involve currency is not. In effect, there’s a maturity mismatch between the way people use blockchains and their long-term maintenance costs. Public blockchains are intended to store data in perpetuity; they achieve this impressive feat by replicating the database across many nodes. However, as mentioned, they rely on the willingness of node operators to ingest, store and serve up this data forever. If transactions impose a significant cost relative to their contribution to the security of the blockchain, they are a net negative.So I’d venture that data inscribed on-chain is an asset to the extent that it’s economically relevant and will contribute value to the system by inducing users to transact. It’s a liability to the extent that node operators must ingest the data, validate it and store it. If the data is a UTXO, it’s highly likely to be relevant in the future: Transactors eventually spend their coins. If it’s spam relating to an airdrop for a transient token, it may never be relevant again. And what node operator wants to foot the bill for terabytes of irrelevant, uneconomical data?To be clear, the Bitcoin-like blockchain model isn’t perfect. Bitcoin depends on the willingness of node operators to download and propagate blocks without compensation, a bit of an oddity in a system that is otherwise strongly driven by free market incentives. To account for this, Bitcoin developers have been careful to limit the amount of block space available such that node operation is still possible on commodity hardware. Depending on how you count it, the entire blockchain is still only about 274 GB, even after 11 years of operation. Levying an ongoing tax on storage, as the state rent proposal aims to do for Ethereum, is another potential solution to the problem. Other blockchains, in their eagerness to differentiate from Bitcoin and its purportedly high fees, created a zero- or low-fee environment.Far from making blockchains more convenient, unlimited block size and zero fees render them less reliable.But, of course, fees serve as a sort of financial proof-of-work. They require transactors to insert only information to the chain they consider worth paying for. This makes it more expensive to generate spam and discourages wasteful usage modes. Since demand for perpetual, highly available storage is almost infinite (wouldn’t you create a highly-available, perpetual cloud backup of your 10 TB torrent collection if storage was essentially free?), it’s likely low- or no-fee chains will be filled with junk data, given enough time.Predictably, this is what has happened. Reduce the clearing price for inclusion on a replicated, highly available database to zero and expect opportunistic spammers who can take advantage. Numerous examples abound. A huge fraction of transactions on Stellar relate to a service called Diruna that apparently incentivized users to spam the blockchain. Diruna appears to be defunct now. Its on-chain footprint lives on, though, effectively indelible. Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin bear the imprint of an application called “Bitcoin Aliens,” a tool that pays users minuscule amounts for viewing ads.Something called “Blitz Ticker” accounts for up to 50% of BCH transactions on any given day. Its purpose? Inserting market data onto the blockchain. Ethereans may remember a period in mid-2018 when the biggest consumer of gas was a mysterious exchange called FCoin, which ran a competitive token listing scheme that incentivized individuals to spam the blockchain. A pattern emerges: private gains, public externalities. FCoin is insolvent now, but its impact will be felt on Ethereum forever because token transactions cannot easily be disentangled and pruned out.Bitcoin’s approach to the issue was to designate an opcode to act as a kind of sink for non-transactional data. Previously, people were encoding data in addresses directly, which were mostly indistinguishable from normal transactions. Thus OP_RETURN was chosen specifically to handle arbitrary data, so it could be identified and pruned out by nodes with little difficulty.As it turns out, Bitcoin’s protocol is designed to cultivate its own UTXO set. OP_RETURN saw significant usage from Omni (which powered Tether transactions) and Veriblock, but little else. The impact on the blockchain is fairly low; Strehle and Steinmetz find that OP_RETURN data in Bitcoin accounts for around 3% of the overall blockchain data overhead. Should it grow, however, nodes would have the option to discard OP_RETURN outputs altogether, as they are provably unspendable and not relevant from a transactional perspective.See also: Crypto Progressives Become Conservative With Their Own ChainsUltimately, node operators on blockchains that are burdened with lots of non-transactional data will have to consider periodically pruning their datasets. This is convenient but trades off against the desirable quality sought in blockchains of data immutability and availability. If validators/archivists can effectively perform eminent domain by arbitrarily deleting data users consider important, their assurances on that chain are effectively nonexistent. So we have a situation where the discarding approach stands in direct opposition to a desirable quality of public blockchains, which is making data available to users in perpetuity.The issue is that if even one single entity has an interest in the existence of some otherwise-nuisance data, validators cannot eliminate that data without effectively depriving this individual of their property. But there’s an enormous asymmetry here: One economically minded individual can essentially compel all present and future users of the blockchain to ingest their transaction. The alternative is the unpalatable choice to disempower commodity nodes and opt for a model where only the largest nodes survive.This tension is unresolvable unless the available data slots are strictly bounded and fees are employed to meter blockchain usage. Open the gauge and deal with either data loss and user frustration, or unbounded state growth and impossible validation.Far from making blockchains more convenient, unlimited block size and zero fees render them less reliable and virtually guarantee either the long-term loss of supposedly immutable data, or require the compromise of decentralization at the node level.Thanks to Antoine Le Calvez, David Vorick, Lucas Nuzzi and Takens Theorem for their feedback.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

BMA accuses Ripple of publicly promoted the sale to investors to drive up demand and maximize profits, without registering the sale with the relevant regulator. It also claims the company purposefully misled investors with false announcements to ""artificially inflate the price at which they can sell XRP.""  The plaintiff adds that XRP had no utility at the time of the first sale in 2013, with its sole value coming from being a speculative investment, and that the $1.1 billion Ripple made from the token sale was more than the rest of the company's combined revenue and cash flow. See also: Ripple Engineers Publish Design for Private Transactions on XRP LedgerVery little is known about BMA. The company was incorporated in Puerto Rico in March 2019 and has one sole director, Pavel Pogodin, named on the corporation registry. It first made headlines after filing a suit against FTX in November, accusing the derivatives exchange of manipulating the price of bitcoin. The case was thrown out in mid-December. BMA appears to represent Pogodin. The filing says he had purchased XRP from Ripple but lost money from relying on Ripple's ""misrepresentations"" that the ""adoption of XRP by financial institutions and banks would drive demand for XRP.""As well as requesting Ripple return all money made in the illegal sale, BMA is also asking the court to award ""compensatory damages.""CoinDesk reached out to Ripple for comment but had not received a reply by press time.See also: Amended Lawsuit Against Ripple Now Offers Theory That XRP May Not Be a SecurityThis isn't the first lawsuit alleging Ripple sold XRP tokens as unregistered securities.

Outside visits are stopped so Ross’s mother, Lyn, and other loved ones, who work tirelessly for his release, are unable to act as “Ross’ lifeline to the outside world.” And Ross stands a good chance of being infected, with rates in his part of the system running four times the New York average. Because of the nature of his crime, Ross is not allowed access to a computer or the internet, not even to check his email. So he spends his time writing, reading and meditating, his mother said, and calling home.See also: Silk Road Operator Pleads Guilty to 1 Charge of Conspiracy“Even though Ross is a grown man, I'm still a mom and can't help reminding him to drink lots of water, wash his hands and take vitamin C when he calls,"" Lyn Ulbricht said. ""He assures me he's doing all that and I don't need to worry, but it's hard under these circumstances. Prisons are probably the most at-risk places for contracting the virus."" The Silk Road holds a storied position in Bitcoin’s history. Named after the ancient trade routes that connected East to West, the online emporium became the currency’s first proven link to the world of internet commerce (it even introduced some well-known crypto folk to bitcoin). Anonymized shoppers could buy anything, as long as it didn't harm a third party, from fake IDs to opioids, or any narcotic, as well as spyware, art and books. For Ulbricht, the innovation wasn’t what was sold, but how: voluntary exchange. “What we’re doing isn’t about scoring drugs or ‘sticking it to the man.’ It’s about standing up for our rights as human beings and refusing to submit when we’ve done no wrong,” the Silk Road founder, then operating under the pseudonym Dread Pirate Roberts, said in an interview with Forbes. (It should be said: Lyn and Ross both maintain this quote is not his. Nor has Forbes has not attributed this quote to Ross.)Despite his alleged crimes, Ulbricht has become a folk hero in libertarian and crypto circles. “Ross is an amazing entrepreneur who helped make the world a better place,” Roger Ver, founder of Bitcoin.com, said in a direct message. Ver is among thousands of supporters who have fomented a movement seeking to liberate Ulbricht (with the hashtag #freeross). And the coronavirus crisis could accelerate this process. “It certainly doesn’t seem like it can hurt his cause,” Ver said.Close, unsanitary quarters are hotbeds for viral infection. Worse, throughout the pandemic prisoners have had limited access to protective or hygienic products and, sometimes, lack basic medical care. These conditions have activists, politicians and even Attorney General William Barr calling for the temporary release of at-risk populations. Others are pushing harder for the amnesty of all non-violent offenders. The call for criminal justice reform amid a global pandemic echoes the issues the Free Ross campaign has been championing for years. Begging the system that put him in prison to now take him out seems like an uphill battle“There’s been a lot more attention brought to the subject [of prison reform],” said Lyn Ulbricht. “There are many people serving horrific sentences in our country now for nonviolent crimes. It shouldn't be like that. We're the biggest incarcerator in the world. That's a national disgrace.”Lyn Ulbricht is the organizing force behind the loosely coordinated campaign seeking her son’s release. In 2013, when the 29-year-old Ulbricht was arrested, she created the FreeRoss.org website to raise awareness and funds for his bail, which was ultimately rebuked. In 2015, ahead of and during the 11-week federal trial held at the Southern District of New York, Lyn spoke frequently at conferences, to media and online arguing Ross’ case had wide implications for the future of internet commerce, First and Fourth amendment rights and criminal justice. See also: Silk Road Seller Pleads Guilty to Money Laundering $19 Million With BitcoinThen, in 2017, after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld Ross’ conviction and sentence – essentially eliminating any chance of legal recourse – she began seeking clemency through political means. This effort has culminated in a petition directed at President Trump, asking him issue Ulbricht a commutation. The most recent petition has received over 280,00 signatures. Many who agitate on Ross’ behalf see his case as representative of the totality of crimes committed through mass incarceration and the prison industrial complex. “We should support anyone who is being persecuted for victimless crimes,” Roger Ver said. “The police, prosecutors and judges are the ones who are the criminal aggressors in this case, and the world should speak out against them just like we now speak out against the runaway slave catchers of the past.”While Ver had donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to the “Freedom Fund” – “He made it possible for us to go to trial,” Lyn said – he remains pessimistic about the political process. “Begging the system that put him in prison to now take him out seems like an uphill battle,” he said. This is something Lyn Ulbricht reluctantly admits. Despite her efforts to reach the Trump administration, his family and even Kim Kardashian – who successfully lobbied the president to release a 63-year-old woman serving a life sentence for a nonviolent drug conviction – she has had little success. “It’s difficult to coordinate efforts. I’ve tried to reach out but it’s not easy to get to them,” she said. While she thinks Trump has shown an inclination to reform the justice system with the First Step Act, “it’s a matter of convincing President Trump this is something that is worthy of his attention and mercy.” That doesn’t mean she lacks hope. Trump makes instinctual decisions, she said, adding, “Anyone who looks at the sentence can see it's wrong.” Ulbricht was a first-time offender, convicted on non-violent charges in a trial that shows some signs of malpractice. The charges listed in Ross’ original indictment would’ve, at minimum, landed him a 30-year prison sentence. A more lenient sentence would be in line with what busted merchants on the Silk Road have been handed. Not to mention the former U.S. Secret Service agent who skimmed bitcoin from the site while participating in federal investigation to uncover its founder. Instead, Ulbricht received a punishment Lyn argues is unconstitutional. “The Eighth Amendment says no cruel or unusual punishment and this is very unusual for a first time nonviolent offender, and it's certainly cruel,” she said. While the conviction has opened her mind to the possible injustices of the law, it’s something all her hopes are tied to.“[Trump] can sign a piece of paper and Ross would walk out the door,” she said.Seven years ago, Ulbricht found himself behind bars at New York’s Metropolitan Detention Center while awaiting trial. Today, this municipal prison system has an infection rate of more than 9 percent, according to the Legal Aid Society. This is compared to the 2 percent infection rate on the city’s streets.Prisoners across the country report they are unable to practice social distancing or even properly wash their hands. Found wanting before the outbreak, prison medical care is reportedly incapable of managing a prison outbreak. In a memo to the Bureau of Prisons, Attorney General Barr confirmed the virus is “materially affecting operations, and called for the release of vulnerable and at-risk inmates to home confinement. Still, there is no consistent national approach to manage the virus in prisons, nor federal guidelines to determine which inmates may be eligible for temporary release. And that guidance may not come soon, with Trump decrying the proactive release of elderly and infirm prisoners he called “very serious criminals” during a White House Coronavirus Task Force briefing earlier this month. 'Even though Ross is a grown man, I'm still a mom and can't help reminding him to drink lots of water, wash his hands and take vitamin C when he calls.'It’s in this landscape that reformist policies begin to make sense. A 2016 report showed nearly 40 percent of people in state and federal prisons were incarcerated without provably presenting a danger to their communities. That means these sentences are “strictly punitive, not correctional,” Lyn Ulbricht said.   During Ross’ bail hearing, prosecutors said he operated “the most sophisticated and extensive criminal market­place on the internet today.” And while the prosecution accused him of hiring hitmen, Ulbricht is, technically, a non-violent offender. A number of eminent scholars, lawyers and celebrities have weighed in, calling the sentence ""a shocking miscarriage of justice,"" to use Noam Chomsky's words.See also: Marco Santori - Silk Road Goes Dark: Bitcoin Survives Its Biggest Market’s Demise (2017)Still young at 36, healthy and without any underlying conditions, it’s unlikely Ulbricht will be released to home confinement during the pandemic. Instead, he, like the majority of the 2.3 million people incarcerated in federal, state and local prisons, jails and other correctional facilities across the country, will spend 22 hours a day “in his cage with his cellmate” as a precautionary measure, Lyn said. Lyn has moved three times since 2013 to be closer to Ross in Arizona so she can make weekly visits. These visits are also on hold for the foreseeable future, and it’s unclear when these restrictions will be lifted. The federal Bureau of Prisons has not responded to a request for comment.“He can be under house arrest with an ankle brace on,” Lyn said. “He’s not a dangerous person.”Update (April 30, 22:50 UTC): This story has been updated to emphasize that Forbes has not identified Ross Ulbricht as the pseudonymous Dread Pirate Roberts interviewed in 2013.

Massive global unemployment, cascading in waves as a viral pandemic shutters most parts of the non-digital economy, has put the world on the precipice of the “everything bubble” Satoshi Nakamoto sought to inoculate us against with the creation of bitcoin.This is both the moment the cryptocurrency community has both eagerly awaited and dreaded. A global pandemic hitting just as sovereign currencies are being architected should serve as an accelerator for rapid issuance and acceptance. This should be true in particular for teetering third-world economies lacking a global reserve currency to inflate their monetary bases without hyperinflationary hell to pay. Additionally, there are undeniable health and hygiene benefits over paper currencies, not just better trackability for tax collection and law enforcement purposes.See also: How Blockchain Tech Can Make Coronavirus Relief More EffectiveThe wheels of legislative and regulatory approval grind slowly in normal times, so it is encouraging that a preliminary digital dollar program nearly made it into the congressional aid package for displaced workers and shuttered businesses as a better way to quickly distribute the multi-trillion-dollar creation of magic Federal Reserve money. Sadly, it was pruned from the final bill on the legislative cutting room floor. Instead, we are left to fill out forms downloaded from bank websites that cannot handle the traffic. These loans may take months to process at a time when millions of recently unemployed workers have little to no savings.Many of the industries where physical contact is required at the last mile are having their legacy supply chains disrupted. Seminars and conferences cannot take place in closed hotels with few planes to fly them in. Restaurants are restricted to take-out in most of the U.S. and Europe, India and large swaths of everywhere else.  Necessity, of course, is the mother of invention and this is where the token foundations and programmers need to step into high gear. They need to finalize and deploy solutions that have been in development for years for smart-contract supply chain management, international global e-commerce payments and remittances, and seamless exchange and wallet onramps and off-ramps to stored value. As the specter of bank runs and closures looms around the developing world, there is substantial demand for reliable asset-backed stablecoins, blockchain-backed precious metals ownership, security tokens sufficiently discounted for risk and for the nascent world of decentralized finance (DeFi), which is currently paying some of the highest interest of any asset class. Who among us will become the Zoom of easy cross-border payments, of smart contract supply chain management and of clearly superior solutions in a dozen other categories.Waiting for legacy global fiat off-ramps to embrace the blockchain in a world already hamstrung by multiple redundant KYC/AML approval loops to access one’s own money when the traditional economy is essentially on fire is a banana upon which the banking industry is poised to slip. Just as we now make our own masks and hand-fashioned bandanas for wearing inside supermarkets, we don’t have time to wait for congressional approval to accelerate the adoption curve for cryptocurrency and blockchain-based solutions.Never has there been a time when Big Tech and Big Consulting are more in need of outside resources to scale solutions to fresh problems in multi-trillion dollar industries. These “too big to fail” firms are already on the pre-approved list for government and Fortune 500 contracts, but they tend to lack the nimbleness, open source ethos, and out-of-the box thinking employed by the cryptocurrency and blockchain ecosystems.One benefit that has come out of the sudden stoppage of physical events is the rapid rise of virtual events, conferences, seminars, networking lounges. Most of them are free after the price of an email address, others priced far less than online webinars of the past. Zoom and other platforms have done a remarkable job of emulating a real conference, including breakout rooms. Zoom (a company my firm briefly represented in its infancy) had to beat out legacy competitors with much larger funding including Cisco, Microsoft and Facebook with a superior interface and stellar execution to win the race (for the moment) as video webcasting king of the hill.  See also: Why This Global Crisis Is a Defining Moment for StablecoinsYou can even have drinks together.

It’s still not the ability to hug or shake someone’s hand. But with virtual events, you can still look someone straight in the eye.  Now is the time for bold action by governments and industry to embrace the blockchain and crypto communities. We have not done the greatest job of educating one another about what it is we do and why – sometimes, physical events produce a lot of grandstanding and posturing, which seem harder to pull off in the intimate video closeups of the Zoom format. Let’s all do our part to connect the dots of the new virtual world with sound alternatives to the increasingly virtual fiat monetary supply and its creaky legacy framework.Let’s see who among us will become the Zoom of easy cross-border payments, of smart contract supply chain management and of clearly superior solutions in a dozen other categories.

Margin trading, in which users can buy and sell assets using borrowed money, could become a key feature of the U.S. operations, FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried told CoinDesk.You're reading First Mover, CoinDesk's daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.“The crypto exchange ecosystem as a whole has been in need of competition for a while, and we're excited to be able to offer liquid order books, tons of features, margin trading for qualified customers and a constantly evolving product in the States,” Bankman-Fried said.Catherine Coley, CEO of the U.S. unit of the  cryptocurrency exchange Binance, told CoinDesk the company is “actively working toward implementing margin trading.” The business, Binance.US, launched last year.Outside the United States, traders can get leverage on purchases of cryptocurrencies and derivatives via exchanges including Binance, Bitfinex and BitMEX, in some cases enabling bets of up to 100 times the money down. All three exchanges initially welcomed traders in the U.S. but later started turning some customers away under pressure from local regulators.“U.S. traders have limited access to margin trading because it's more tightly regulated here than in other jurisdictions,” said Jake Chervinsky, general counsel for Compound, a San Francisco-based cryptocurrency lender.The dearth of margin-trading venues for U.S. cryptocurrency investors highlights the balkanized nature of the fast-evolving international digital-asset marketplace: It’s nominally a 24-hour, 7-day-a-week realm that crosses sovereign borders, but in reality rules are applied differently by financial authorities across multiple jurisdictions.Jim Harper, a visiting fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and former counsel to U.S. congressional committees, said in an email that domestic regulators are applying a consumer-protection lens to rules governing domestic cryptocurrency exchanges. That may not comport with the mentality of crypto traders who don’t mind taking bigger risks, with less protection. “Every aspect of the cryptocurrency world is high risk, high reward,” Harper said. CME, the Chicago-based exchange that has offered regulated bitcoin futures contracts since late 2017, allows trading on margin but at a much lower level than international exchanges beyond the reach of U.S. regulators. For example, the CME's May bitcoin futures contract requires a maintenance margin of $14,743 per contract, according to the exchange's website. That works out to about 33% of the five-bitcoin contract's closing price on Tuesday, based on a quote of $9,030 per bitcoin. The leverage equivalent is 3x. The CME is regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which imposes strict rules on the use of margin. “To protect people from getting burned, the CFTC is arguably inhibiting the development of a U.S. market and capacities among U.S. investors to exercise the kind of caution they'll need in what is truly a global financial services market,” said Harper. At least two U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchanges, Kraken and Coinbase, offer margin trading, but also at a lower level than the high-octane levels on some of the overseas venues. At Kraken, the limit is 5x leverage, and at Coinbase it’s 3x. “Of course, margin trading in crypto specifically is ultra-risky given the tendency for major daily moves, and that might be why U.S. exchanges have been wary to roll it out in a meaningful way,” said Kinjal Shah, senior associate at Blockchain Capital.Some investors say the availability of leverage can deepen a market by attracting additional traders, in turn helping to assure a good price and execution. “Margin products available to U.S.-domiciled investments funds are highly limited mainly because of the regulatory hurdles here in the U.S.,” said Justin Yashouafar, managing partner at Los Angeles-based Blockhead Capital. According to Chervinsky, any exchanges looking to bolster their margin trading offerings are likely to bump into limits imposed by U.S. regulators.They still wouldn't be able to offer “the high leverage ratios that offshore exchanges have popularized with crypto traders,” he said.BTC: Price: $9,222 (BPI) | 24-Hr High: $9,290 | 24-Hr Low: $8,811Trend: Bitcoin is trading above $9,200 at press time amid mixed signals on the technical charts. While the above-70 reading on the 14-day relative strength index indicates overbought conditions and scope for a pullback, the Chaikin money flow, which incorporates both prices and trading volumes, is still hovering above zero – a sign buying pressure is stronger than selling pressure. More importantly, Tuesday's UTC close above $9,000, the first in two months, validated dip demand near $8,500 observed on Monday, and restored the immediate bullish bias.The outlook had turned neutral following the cryptocurrency's repeated failures to keep gains above $9,000 over the weekend. The pennant breakout seen on the four-hour chart also indicates the path of least resistance is to the higher side.  With price charts showing bullish patterns, the overbought reading on the RSI takes a back seat. After all, indicators follow price. As such, one can expect bitcoin to revisit the April 30 high of $9,485. The bullish case would be invalidated if prices drop below Tuesday's low of $8,760. At press time, that looks unlikely, as futures on the S&P 500 and major European stocks are flashing green. Sentiment looks to have been buoyed by major economies moving toward easing lockdown restrictions and an uptick in crude prices. The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Despite the Federal Reserve creating new money at an unprecedented rate, the U.S. dollar exchange rate is rising. The U.S. government is pouring trillions of dollars into the economy to support failing businesses and people losing their jobs. When governments and central banks put new money into the economy, consumer prices usually rise. But in March, against what you would expect, consumer prices fell by 0.4%. As dollars are apparently being swallowed up by the black hole created by the coronavirus, issuance of dollar-backed stablecoins is soaring as more and more people invest in them. Especially popular are stablecoins such as USDT, USDC, BUSD and Pax, which are backed one-for-one with dollar reserves. See also: Money Reimagined: Demand for USD Stablecoins Foreshadows Financial DisruptionWhat’s driving this growing interest in stablecoins? One explanation might be investors reaching for yield. As global interest rates fall, returns on conventional assets become increasingly disappointing. Stablecoins themselves don’t deliver dollar returns – indeed they are designed not to – but they do give easy access to the crypto world for investors looking for better returns. This is a persuasive argument. Right now, the outlook is bullish for crypto. Partly, this is because of bitcoin’s forthcoming halving: after previous halvings the price has always risen sharply, so there could be a potential profit opportunity from getting in now. But it’s also because of a growing belief among investors that the Fed’s extraordinary rate of money creation could result in runaway inflation. A century ago, central bank money printing in Germany’s Weimar Republic caused prices to rise so much that people paid for loaves of bread with wheelbarrows full of banknotes. Get your wheelbarrows out, dollar slaves! Runaway inflation in fiat currencies would be good for Bitcoin, and indeed for any scarce asset. After all, who is going to want to keep their savings in the form of dollars if the dollars are going to be inflated away any time now? So wise investors might exchange their dollars for crypto, thus benefiting from what could be a considerable bull run as fiat currencies burn. Though the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation expectations, the five-year, five-year forward spread, is not predicting runaway inflation. If anything, it is deflation, not inflation, that most investors foresee. CoinDesk's Michael Casey wonders if the surge in stablecoins could be driven not by investors reaching for yield or expecting high inflation, but by businesses desperate to find a secure source of dollar liquidity at a time of crisis. Stablecoins, after all, are equivalent to dollars. And they provide access to a payments network that is global, usually efficient, and – importantly – doesn’t rely on banks. Whether stablecoin issuers can meet the FDIC’s requirements has not yet been tested.Banks depend for their survival on the solvency of their borrowers. When the economy crashes, businesses fail and people lose their jobs, banks can become very wobbly. And, since the 2008 crisis, government bailouts of banks have become anathema. These days, deposits can be “haircut” to bail out banks, as they were in Cyprus. Or banks can close their doors, and governments can stop you taking out your money via ATMs, as happened in Greece. So your deposits can shrink or you can lose access to them just when you most need money to keep your business afloat. Because of the scale of business failures and job losses at the moment, widespread loan defaults – and associated bank failures – seem highly likely. “Given the post-COVID-19 outlook for banks’ loan customers,” says Casey, “some will doubt the security of their deposits, regardless of whether they are denominated in dollars.”And he continues:What’s a business to do then? They can’t withdraw and hoard cash to protect themselves; banknotes are hardly a viable payments option in the modern world. But perhaps dollar-backed stablecoins pose an option….Banks don’t keep enough cash reserves to ensure everyone can withdraw their money whenever they want to. But stablecoins do. So, why not put your money into fully reserved stablecoins instead of fractionally reserved banks? Your dollars would be completely safe, and you would also have the opportunity to invest in cryptocurrencies or lend out your stablecoins for a good return. As Casey puts it, “Since the token issuer commits to hold the full equivalent in reserves for all tokens issued, the fractional reserve system’s perennial question about deposit assurance ceases to be an issue.”Sadly, this is much too good to be true. The reserve backing of these stablecoins is smoke and mirrors, just like the reserve backing of banks. Indeed it relies on exactly the same confidence trick. See also: Marek Olszewski - Why This Global Crisis Is a Defining Moment for StablecoinsReserves for the four biggest stablecoins – USDT, USDC, Pax and BUSD – are all kept in banks, mostly in deposit accounts, though some are in money market accounts backed by U.S. Treasurys. The banks have FDIC insurance, of course, but then so do ordinary bank deposit accounts. If businesses’ own FDIC-insured bank deposit accounts aren’t safe, then neither are the FDIC-insured deposit accounts that hold stablecoin reserves. What’s more, FDIC insurance is limited. The standard limit is $250,000 per customer, depository institution, and ownership category. So, a business with several accounts in one bank whose balances together add up to $300,000 is only covered by insurance for the first $250,000. But if the business has accounts at two different banks with less than $250,000 in each bank, then they are fully insured. For the four stablecoins I looked at, the quantity of pooled reserves in the deposit accounts appears to exceed FDIC insurance limits. Indeed in the case of Paxos, which manages the reserves of not only its own stablecoin Pax, but also Binance’s BUSD, the auditor’s report specifically says that the amounts in the deposit accounts exceed FDIC limits. So although the reserves exist, they are not fully insured. If the banks in which they are held fail, stablecoin reserves in excess of FDIC limits could be seized to bail out the banks. The reserve status of stablecoins may be a confidence trick, but the investment opportunity is real.Some stablecoin issuers claim that stablecoin “deposits” (the dollars you pay when you buy stablecoins) qualify for FDIC pass-through insurance. The argument is that the dollars are held in custody in common accounts on your behalf. But FDIC pass-through insurance comes with significant restrictions: for example, people’s individual deposits within the common funds must be clearly identifiable and regularly reported. It also excludes investments such as mutual funds and securities. Whether stablecoin issuers can meet the FDIC’s requirements has not yet been tested. And nor has the legal status of stablecoins that are issued by, and actively traded on, crypto exchanges solely for the purpose of speculation in cryptocurrencies. Speculative assets aren’t covered by FDIC insurance. So, stablecoin reserves may not be fully protected by FDIC insurance. And if they aren’t, then stablecoins may actually be less secure than ordinary bank deposit accounts. If people really are investing in stablecoins because they think they are safer than bank deposit accounts, I’m afraid they have allowed the smoke to get in their eyes and the mirrors to blind them. That doesn’t mean that investing in stablecoins is a bad idea. After all, there is that halving coming up, and there is the possibility of inflation. And returns on crypto assets can be really good. The reserve status of stablecoins may be a confidence trick, but the investment opportunity is real. Just remember that nothing is ever completely safe, and there is no such thing as a free lunch.  The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Other supported assets will include bitcoin, binance coin and BUSD, the exchange's dollar stablecoin. Bundle was the brainchild of Binance Labs' former director, Yele Bademosi, who grew up in a town just north of Lagos, the Nigerian capital. The app received $450,000 in seed funding from Binance in late 2019 and, while part of the exchange's ecosystem, will run as an independent entity.  Although Binance's press release mentions that Bundle is backed by ""other African investors,"" it doesn't give specifics. Binance already has a presence in Nigeria. The exchange's local director told CoinDesk earlier this year it had received ""thousands"" of new signups soon after launching a fiat on-ramp in the country in October 2019.Using Nigeria as a launchpad, Binance said Bundle will be fully operational in as many as 30 other African countries by the end of 2020.

this year, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.","Apr 28, 2020 at 19:38 UTC","A planned upgrade that would allow token holders to earn staking income is bringing out users in droves to Kyber Network, a decentralized exchange (DEX) for cryptocurrency trading.  ","The number of addresses with a balance in Kyber Network Crystal (KNC) – an Ethereum token that fuels operations on the DEX – reached an all-time high of 61,980 on April 27, according to blockchain intelligence firm IntoTheBlock. The number is up 14% from the tally of 54,210 addresses seen on Jan. 1. “With more addresses, we are seeing more users and the community trusting and embracing the Kyber’s growth potential,” said John Ng Pangilinan, managing partner at Signum Capital, which is an investor in Kyber Network.Kyber's active addresses, price and trading volume have also witnessed solid growth this year. The number of active addresses using KNC on a given day has increased by over 100% over the last 12 months, as noted by IntoTheBlock’s report. Meanwhile, the token’s U.S. dollar-denominated price recently rose to nine-month highs near 82 cents in March and was last seen at 67 cents – up 260% on a year-to-date basis, according to data provider Messari. Bitcoin, the top cryptocurrency by market value, has added just 8% so far this year, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index. Daily trading volume surged from $10 million in early January to $240 million in mid-March. While first-time Kyber users have doubled since the beginning of the year, USD and ether (ETH) volumes on the DEX have more than tripled, according to the network’s official blog. On March 12, bitcoin crashed by over 40% and extended the decline to levels under $4,000 on the following day, injecting extreme volatility into the broader crypto markets. On March 13, Kyber recorded its highest daily activity with $33.7 million traded over a single 24-hour period.The surge in investor interest could be attributed to the upcoming protocol upgrade Katalyst, which will allow KNC holders to earn yield on their token and participate in determining and facilitating economic flow on the network. The upgrade is expected to take place at the end of the second quarter.Backing up a bit, Kyber Network is an on-chain exchange that allows instant trading and conversion of cryptocurrencies and tokens with high liquidity. It does so with the help of reserve entities – either internal or arranged by third parties – which bring liquidity to the platform; reserve managers who maintain the reserve, calculate exchange rates and feed the data into the network; and the Kyber Network operator, which adds and removes reserve entities. The reserve managers are required to purchase KNC tokens to operate a reserve on the network, and pay a small KNC fee to Kyber each time a transaction or a token exchange occurs. The fee is then used to reward third parties who bring trading volume to the network and the rest of the tokens are taken out of circulating supply via coin burn. Put simply, Kyber currently relies on coin burn to provide value to KNC holders.However, following the impending protocol upgrade, KNC holders will receive a cut of transaction fees in the form of ETH relative to the number of tokens staked. “Also, reserves would get rebates for volume generated and wouldn't have to hold KNC to operate on the network,” said Shane Hong, marketing manager at Kyber Network.Staking refers to the process of holding coins in a cryptocurrency wallet to support the operations on a blockchain in return for newly minted coins. In layman’s terms, it is similar to earning interest on a fixed income investment like bonds. Essentially, the protocol upgrade will allow holders to earn yield by staking the tokens. “These additional ways to generate yield via staking, coupled with token burning is a major incentive to purchase and hold KNC,” said Connor Abendschein, crypto research analyst at Digital Assets Data. “This could be the reason why we have seen such a drastic rise in the number of addresses holding KNC.”Other decentralized exchanges have been turning to staking models that allow holders to generate higher returns as the network grows. For instance, the Ox protocol implemented a staking system for ZRX token holders in December, when the Ox V3 upgrade went live on Ethereum mainnet. However, KNC staking will earn rewards only if the holders vote on network issues under a new community platform for decentralized governance. That platform, known as KyberDAO, is to launch simultaneously with the Katalyst upgrade. “It will complement the new token model, where KNC holders, who stake KNC, will get to vote for proposals and earn voting rewards in ETH,"" Hong said.Essentially, the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) will give more power to the wider community in determining key parameters of the network such as network fees, burning ratios and reserve incentives.“The fact that holding KNC will allow investors to participate in developing the protocol could also be a prominent reason for the rise in addresses with KNC balances,” said Pangilinan.Kyber, being an on-chain liquidity protocol, is also benefiting from the growth in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, where there is an increased need to swap assets. In February, bZx, a DeFi lending protocol that uses Kyber Network’s price feed, suffered an oracle attack, which saw a trader walk away with a profit of 2,388 ether ($468,000 as per the latest ETH/USD rate). Some observers criticized Kyber for low liquidity back then. ""The attack came down to bad price data, specifically from DeFi network Kyber"", bZx co-founder Kyle Kistner told CoinDesk at the time.That, however, did not have any negative impact on KNC’s price or reputation as a price oracle, or supplier of price information. “As investors, we watched the fall out happen but KNC held its price and started to bounce back,” said Pangilinan. KNC’s price rallied by 18% on Feb. 18 – the day the attack took place. The network is now being used by over 100 decentralized applications, more than 45 reserves and is the most used DeFi project on Ethereum. New projects including Rarible, Unstoppable Domains, Bullionix, Gelato, and Idle Finance integrated the protocol in March and April.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

of dollars in credit to trade bitcoin and then pay what it owes at the ...","Apr 27, 2020 at 09:40 UTC",LGO Markets is taking an unusual step for a cryptocurrency exchange by letting clients trade without pre-funding accounts.,"The Hoboken, N.J.-based firm's clients, mostly crypto hedge funds and market makers, can now get an intraday credit line and send cash to the exchange when the trading day is over, CEO Hugo Renaudin told CoinDesk. For LGO, which now boasts over 50 clients (almost all of them institutions) in about 20 countries, the nominal end of the day is 10 a.m. Eastern time, Renaudin said. After passing a risk assessment, a client can get up to “several millions” of dollars in credit to trade bitcoin and then pay what it owes at the settlement time, he said. “They don’t have to park funds, there is no risk of a hack, it’s a scalable and flexible way to finance. We can extend these credit lines, and it works as a clearinghouse.”Although it's commonplace in traditional financial markets, allowing trades without pre-funding is rare in crypto. According to Matt Trudeau, chief product and strategy officer at ErisX, LGO’s competitor, pre-funding is necessary to mitigate counterparty risk.“Because both cash and crypto are already in the clearinghouse, we eliminate settlement risk for the counterparties. This also means all participants on our exchange can confidently trade with all other participants on our exchange without needing to know who they are, and assess their credit risks,” Trudeau explained.To finance this service, LGO is using a combination of funds it raised in its 2018 token sale (which brought in 3,600 BTC, nearly $36 million at the time) and borrowed capital, both in fiat and crypto, from traditional banks and crypto lenders, Renaudin said. He wouldn't identify the lenders.LGO is banking at the crypto-friendly Signature Bank and recently got financing from the market maker B2C2, which bought a share in the exchange this month.The credit line is not the first unorthodox idea LGO has tried. When it launched in March 2019, Renaudin told CoinDesk that LGO wouldn’t keep clients’ funds. The plan was that users would maintain their own custody and trade via multi-signature wallets that required two out of three private keys to release funds.A year later, LGO quietly abandoned the idea. The reason? Institutional clients, who are the exchange’s target audience, don’t want to take care of their keys, Renaudin said last week.“Most of the volume is made by crypto-native institutions, like hedge funds, and they are used to using custodial platforms,” Renaudin explained.Having funds with a qualified custodian helps the institutional players sleep at night, he said, so LGO’s clients can hold their funds either on the exchange itself or use BitGo, which partnered with LGO in April 2019. Another idea, making its own hardware wallet, which LGO was planning to release some time in the summer of 2019, also got scrapped, Renaudin said. For the same reason: no client demand. “All the bells and whistles we talked about last year, they were good, but when confronted with the market, we saw the demand was not there,” Renaudin said. LGO has also decided not to pursue a number of licenses as originally intended. These include a New York BitLicense, a FINRA broker-dealer license and a National Futures Association broker license. All this is on hold now, Renaudin said.LGO decided to focus on the more familiar jurisdiction of France, where Renaudin and other members of the team hail from. The exchange has applied for a digital custodial license there, Renaudin said. LGO is registered as a money services business (MSB) in the U.S. with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a bureau of the Treasury Department. However, one idea from the early days survived: broadcasting LGO's trades (both the fiat and crypto sides) to the Bitcoin blockchain. A list of these trades can be seen on the LGO website. According to this page, LGO has processed some $33 million worth of trades so far in April, $138 million in March and $96 million in February.UPDATE (14:46 UTC, April 27, 2020): A previous version of this article mistakenly said LGO banked at Silvergate Bank instead of Signature Bank.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Bitcoin and Ethereum because fewer computers have to reach agreement ...","May 3, 2020 at 14:10 UTC",How do you hack an enterprise blockchain? We may find out soon enough.,"Enterprise blockchain products have been designed mostly as private networks, limited to authorized parties. This is supposed to make them more efficient than public chains like Bitcoin and Ethereum because fewer computers have to reach agreement on who owns what, and in a sense safer because the participants know each other.These products apply technology originally developed for the Wild West of cryptocurrency to a range of unglamorous corporate activities, including cross-border transactions, storing records, and tracking goods and information. Their promise has attracted some of the world’s largest corporations and software vendors. But like any software, they can in theory be hacked, although how to prevent that hacking isn’t as well documented. “I can’t recall a single major company announcing a loss of any kind from a hack on a private blockchain,” says Paul Brody, global blockchain lead at consulting giant EY. Read more: Meet Red Date, the Little-Known Tech Firm Behind China’s Big Blockchain VisionThat may change in the near future as companies start bringing these gated systems out of the lab and into real-world use. “Big companies have been working on blockchain apps for a couple years now,” said Pavel Pokrovsky, the blockchain lead at Kaspersky, the Moscow-based anti-virus software vendor. “Soon, they will start pushing those apps into production and might face new challenges in managing their risks. As more such solutions get deployed, attacks on them might become more frequent.”One problem is that private, permissioned systems are most vulnerable to insider threats, both Pokrovsky and Brody said. “Insider risk is particularly high in private blockchains because the work that is usually done to secure information within the private network is very low compared to public networks,” said EY’s Brody, who has been a rare voice among the Big Four professional-services firms in stumping for open systems.  “On public networks, we make extensive use of zero-knowledge proofs and other tools to keep sensitive data off-chain.” Only one or two of EY’s corporate clients went to such lengths with private networks, he said. “As a result, if you can gain access to the network or you already have it as an insider, nearly all the critical data is actually visible to all the members.” In general, Pokrovsky said, the most common type of attack that can theoretically be employed against an enterprise blockchain network is a denial of service attack. This is different from a DDoS, or distributed denial of service, where a company’s servers are inundated with useless requests that overwhelm them.Read more: Miners Trick Stablecoin Protocol PegNet, Turning $11 Into Almost $7M HoardDenial of service, on the other hand, is a focused attack that uses knowledge – perhaps an ex-employee - rather than electronic muscle power.“Let’s say an employee of a company gets fired and he’s angry at his ex-employer. He goes to the dark web and sells his knowledge of the vulnerabilities in the system to hackers,” Pokrovsky said.In the case of enterprise blockchains, an attacker would need to know the addresses of the nodes and what can put them offline. “An attacker can overwhelm the node’s data storage capacity, flood it with useless calculations,” Pokrovsky said. “For example, one of our clients’ nodes could not process very large numbers, say, 12 zeroes and more. They would just freeze.”The cure for that kind of attack is proper filtering of the data entering the nodes, he said: “It’s a very widespread mistake, not filtering the incoming data.”Exploiting such a vulnerability is easy when you know where the nodes are and, unlike DDoS, it does not require buying traffic in the form of bots that flood your target with garbage traffic, or deploying a lot of hardware to attack the server. “You just write a simple script and send it to the nodes,” Pokrovsky said. Then the nodes go offline. This can be utilized for criminal purposes from sabotaging a competitor to terrorist attacks, Pokrovsky said.The situation can be exacerbated by the fact that the most convenient way to set up nodes for a private blockchain is to use cloud infrastructure so companies don’t have to figure out how to set up a physical node in their office.“Most private blockchains have very few nodes and, in many cases, they all reside inside a single cloud infrastructure, creating a single point of failure,” Brody said. “That also means that far from being immutable stores of information, they are in fact easy to erase or shut down.”The risks can vary. For example, Masterchain, the enterprise blockchain for banks developed under the auspices of Russia’s central bank, is a fork, or modified copy, of the Ethereum blockchain, which uses a proof-of-work consensus mechanism. Taking down nodes on such a network would lead to the consensus re-distributing among the remaining nodes, which would continue to validate transactions. However, if it turns out all the remaining nodes are controlled by the central bank, the network participants might argue, the transactions recorded while everyone else was down are not legitimate, Pokrovsky said. Read more: DeFi Project dForce Refunds All Affected Users After $25M Hack“DDoS is an attack easy and cheap to organize, but it’s also easy to prevent, and services like Cloudflare can identify and effectively prevent it. But the denial of service is not identifiable by the filters such services use,” Pokrovsky said, adding that sometimes attackers don’t even need an insider to locate the nodes – it’s possible to find such information via open source intelligence methods. “It’s very hard to fix such vulnerabilities as the attack is happening, when everything’s crashed, everyone’s running around and everything is on fire,” he said – it’s better to try to predict such situations in a testing environment. If a blockchain uses smart contracts, they can be attacked as well, Pokrovsky said. “For the enterprise blockchains, the typical attack is when a contract contains variables that can turn out different for each node, for example, timestamps or random numbers,” he said. “In this case, every node would execute the smart contract with a different result and the transaction will not be recorded into the blockchain as a result.”If a smart contract refers to documents, there is another possible way to attack it: inserting malicious code into the document. Read more: Hacker Exploits Flaw in Decentralized Bitcoin Exchange Bisq to Steal $250K“It’s the same as the SQL injection attack and to prevent it you need to filter the incoming data and limit the use of external data by the smart contract,” Pokrovsky said. The fact that most private blockchains don’t enjoy the attention of a broad blockchain community is also a weakness, Brody said. “Perhaps the biggest risk posed by private blockchains is the risk of complacency,” he said. “Open source code that isn’t widely used and doesn’t have a vigilant community testing and inspecting it is far less secure and reliable than systems like Bitcoin and Ethereum, which are continuously hardened by nearly constant attack and public inspection.”With an eye perhaps toward broadening its revenue stream, Kaspersky moved into blockchain-oriented research and consulting in 2018, first focusing on public blockchains including Bitcoin and Ethereum. Kaspersky has been working with crypto exchanges and completed a security audit for the trading software company Merkeleon in October 2018. In October 2019, Kaspersky started working with enterprise blockchains, too. Pokrovsky told CoinDesk the company audited a number of such systems, only two of which he could name publicly: Russia-based blockchain startup Insolar and Waves, which has been re-focusing from public to private blockchains since last year.Kaspersky software has been listed among the top 10 antivirus products globally by PC Magazine in March but it has been banned from being installed on U.S. government computers since 2017 as part of the U.S. response to Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. That ban caused sales to plunge in the U.S. and Europe but they have expanded in Russia as well as Africa. Kaspersky reported 4 percent revenue growth in 2018.Kaspersky’s Waves Enterprise audit took three months, from November 2019 to the end of January 2020. “The task was to check the security of the nodes, network infrastructure and nodes’ web interfaces,” Pokrovsky said.The security firm ran what it calls “grey box” testing, in which the tester does not have access to the blockchain platform’s full code, but does have administrator-level access to the system. This kind of testing would show possible insider threats, like an ex-employee going rogue. After the testing is over, Kaspersky presents the client with the list of vulnerabilities and the client fixes them. Then the testing is run again. Pokrovsky would not disclose what weaknesses had to be “fixed” on Waves Enterprise’ blockchain.

Many other crypto analytics tools – including those from CipherTrace – trace payments between wallet addresses as they scout out potential troublespots, bypassing the banks. Such programs often appeal to exchanges and law enforcement investigators.In contrast, Armada is a tool for the banks. It “plugs into” their existing transaction monitoring systems, said John Jefferies, chief financial analyst for CipherTrace. There, it monitors illicit activity via machine learning, clustering algorithms and CipherTrace’s database of high-risk entities.This “enables Armada to catch money services businesses (MSB) that may be obscuring their true nature through different names or hidden accounts,” said Vice President of Product Management Catherine Woneis.See Also: PayPal Joins $4.2M Round for Crypto Banking Compliance StartupCipherTrace offered the case of unlicensed bitcoin seller Kunal Kalra as an example of how Armada could be used.

Armada would have flagged Kalra’s activity with the banks, CipherTrace said.Jefferies said Armada will also help improve ties between legitimate VASPs and their bankers,“Armada helps VASPs open and keep bank accounts, which is critically important because they typically have problems maintaining banker relationships that can lead to risky behaviour,” he said.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

","Omni Layer, built on Bitcoin, has suffered negative growth in Tether transactions for the last 12 consecutive months. Tether supply on Omni Layer has also fallen more than 50% over the same period, according to Coin Metrics.Omni Layer’s Tether supply peaked in mid-2018 at just over $3 billion. Tether tokens first launched on Omni Layer in October 2014. While fluctuations in stablecoin supply and transaction counts happen regularly, it’s unusual for there to be a contraction in supply for months at a time, especially for Tether.Omni Layer was the only one to support Tether for over three years until the stablecoin launched as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum in November 2017. In less than two years, Ethereum’s share of Tether’s total circulating supply eclipsed Omni Layer’s.Disparate Tether growth across different protocols probably is due to “current demand on each chain,” said Sean Gilligan, developer at Omni Layer. Tether can move unused tethers on Omni Layer to another chain with higher demand by issuing a simple “revoke” transaction, Gilligan explained.Performance concerns across Tether-supported protocols seem to be driving demand on platforms like Ethereum and away from Omni Layer.“I think it mostly comes down to Ethereum being much better payment rails for something like Tether and other stablecoins,” said Anthony Sassano, adviser to mStable, a stablecoin unification protocol.Transaction fees and confirmation times were the primary reasons Tether decided to evolve its stablecoin into a cross-chain asset supported by multiple protocols, according to Paolo Ardoino, CTO at Tether.At Tether, we truly care for Omni, since it was the first protocol that made Tether possible, and it also relies on Bitcoin security. But we had to give traders what they were asking for.Traders were routinely worried about sudden spikes in Bitcoin transaction fees that caused arbitrage trades to become “crazy expensive,” said Ardoino. The other concern, confirmation times, resulted from some exchanges waiting for three Bitcoin blocks to credit Omni Layer transactions, which could mean “losing the moment in the market.”“Omni on Bitcoin provides users with multisig and a level of robustness that other chains may lack, while some chains may have lower transaction fees or faster blocks,” said Craig Sellars, co-founder of Tether and chief technologist of Omni. “It’s all about the users’ preference as to which capabilities they want to imbue their digital dollars.”See also: Bitfinex, Tether Seek Subpoenas Across US in Hunt for Missing $800MMultisignature (multisig) security means more than one digital signature is required to execute a transaction.Ethereum currently holds the lion’s share of Tether’s supply, with nearly 3.5 billion tokens issued on Ethereum since February. Tron, a protocol similarly optimized for token issuance, holds nearly as many tokens as Omni Layer, at the time of publication.“At Tether, we truly care for Omni, since it was the first protocol that made Tether possible, and it also relies on Bitcoin security. But we had to give traders what they were asking for,” said Ardoino.“A faster, cheaper ledger with more granular levels of control is much more useful to [Tether],” said Eric Wall, chief investment officer at Arcane Assets. “USDT, by virtue of being a centralized asset, does not benefit much from Bitcoin's expensive state-attacker-grade censorship-resistance.” Censorship resistance to coordinated attacks from state governments is a primary feature of established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. For stablecoins, however, the benefits of this high-level security may be limited. To date, Tether has tested eight different protocols: Omni Layer, Ethereum, Litecoin, Tron, EOS, Algorand, Liquid Network and Bitcoin Cash. All of them currently support Tether except Litecoin. In fact, Tether’s cross-chain evolution is a dominant competitive strategy for the stablecoin. Tether quickly seized on the simple growth strategy of providing each blockchain community with access to the cryptocurrency industry’s oldest and most liquid stablecoin.See also: Tether Stablecoin Launches on Its Seventh Blockchain“Each of these blockchains need a stablecoin in order to implement DEXes, DeFi projects and many other projects,” said Ardoino. “It's astonishing that till today our competition did not realize that yet,” he said. “I think that USDT will continue to be a multi-blockchain asset,” said Sassano, adding that the status quo rate of Ethereum use and development makes him think most of Tether’s supply will “live on Ethereum for the long term.”Regardless of what the future holds for Tether’s continued growth, the Omni Layer will always consider itself to be a special place for Tether. “Omni Layer on Bitcoin is [Tether’s] home, but it has other places to go when it wants to go skiing or skydiving,” said Sellars.UPDATE (May 5, 2020 15:04 UTC): The percentage decrease in Tether supply on Omni has been updated for accuracy.

Tim Draper, who became a partner of Goren Holm in 2019, said the plugin would ""make us one step closer to the dream of a truly borderless world."" Alon Goren – a founding partner of the firm and author of the plugin – said 35 percent of the internet was built using WordPress. Launching the product on the massively popular platform means anyone can now have their own cryptocurrency exchange, he said.  While the plugin is designed to be to some extent customizable, it is not an exchange per se. Using the API from crypto swaps platform Totle, the plugin routes orders to decentralized trading platforms said to be listing the best prices. It also doesn't have any built-in facility to store digital assets but is compatible with existing wallet plugins, like MetaMask, Brave and Coinbase Wallet.  See also: VC Tim Draper Eyes India Investments as Nation Enters Crypto ‘Renaissance’While that may mean the exchange might not be vulnerable to a classic exchange hack, Draper Goren Holm's press release was light on the security features of the plugin. WordPress – which allowed users to pay in bitcoin until 2015 – may be ubiquitous but users don't always maintain the best security practices. Security specialist WP White Security said more than 70 percent of all WordPress sites in 2013 were vulnerable to attacks due to poor password policies or outdated firewall protection. CoinDesk reached out to Draper Goren Holm for more details, but hadn't received a response by press time.

of the bitcoin guys to write an article which explains to me how you ...","May 5, 2020 at 12:00 UTC","Many of the impacts of COVID-19 are easy to grasp. Every day we see the gutting news: the rising body count, the millions of unemployed, the makeshift morgues in public parks. We grieve for those we have lost. We worry about those who are vulnerable. We’re sick of staying at home. We miss restaurants and pubs. ","And then there are the second-, third- and fourth-order impacts. These are tougher to spot. In the blizzard of news from the U.S. emergency stimulus package, for example, it was easy to overlook a fairly shocking proposal from the House of Representatives: that the COVID-19 relief money (aka the $1,200 checks) could be digitally zapped to Americans instead of going through traditional banks. As CoinDesk’s own Michael Casey writes in the forward to ""The Currency Cold War, ""the ""half-baked proposal was subsequently removed, but it marked a dramatic widening in the Overton window of what is open to discussion. A digital dollar is now on the table.” Meanwhile, in another corner of this emerging conflict, libra looms large. And China gets ready to launch its central bank digital currency (known as the DCEP).  See also: Money Reimagined: As Tech, Politics and COVID-19 Collide, a Global Reset LoomsThe upshot? COVID-19 could ignite something of a digital currency war.Good thing someone just wrote a book about that exact possibility. Fintech guru David Birch, a consultant and prolific speaker on the blockchain conference circuit, wrote ""The Currency Cold War: Cash and Cryptography, Hash Rates and Hegemony,"" just in time for our global pandemic. He nailed the timing. For years Birch had his own pet theories about a clash of digital currencies. But “that was just me, just some guy talking about it,” he tells me in his British accent, which seems always on the verge of a sly joke. “And who cares, you know?”Then came Jackson Hole. ALSO IN CONSENSUS MAGAZINEThe CoinDesk 50, by CoinDesk staffGeneration Crypto, by Jessica KleinCrypto in Corona: From Switzerland to Liberland, by Jeff WilserThe Men Who Stare at Charts, by Ben MunsterMichelle Phan: The Beauty of Bitcoin, by Leigh CuenThe Changemaker: Glen Weyl Puts His Radical Ideas Into Action, by Jeff WilserIn the fall of 2019, at a Jackson Hole, Wy., event Birch describes as a “Burning Man for people who run central banks,” the Governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, said that perhaps it was time for some form of “synthetic hegemonic currency” to deal with what he called the “destabilizing dominance” of the U.S. dollar.This comment seemed to galvanize Birch. “The Governor of the Bank of England is emphatically not just some guy,” Birch says. He realized the Currency Cold War was not just his own pet theory – it was imminent. It might already be happening. And it has consequences. Which currency would society choose? Would it be one or many?It’s crazy. What the f--- are they doing mailing out checks to people?“Which digital currency?” Birch writes in ""The Currency Cold War."" “Will we really be choosing between the Federal Reserve and Microsoft (between dollar bills and Bill’s dollars)? Between Facebook’s Libra and China’s Digital Currency/Electronic Payment (DCEP) system? Between spendable drawing rights (SDRs) and Kardashian kash?”Regular readers of CoinDesk, of course, already know cryptocurrencies could compete with traditional fiat. That idea is not new. Birch takes the next logical step by asking, effectively, what happens when the rubber hits the road? Let’s pretend we get a Facebook libra or a digital yuan. How would that change the world order? What would that mean to a farmer in Africa, or what would it mean for the United States’ ability to throw around its muscle? In the book, Birch frames the hypothetical conflict of a digital yuan vs. Facebook libra as “Red vs. Blue,” in a cheeky nod to the cult videos inspired by Halo. (Birch even asked the publisher if they could call the book “Red vs. Blue,” and they politely told him he was crazy.)Red vs. Blue? Crypto vs. Fiat? Public vs. Private? On a quarantine-Zoom call a few weeks before appearing at Consensus Distributed on May 11 at 9 a.m. ET, Birch explains why the currency Cold War matters, how it impacts global “soft power,” and why you might see things like IBM Money…or an Islamic Money that cannot be used to buy alcohol. CoinDesk: Your book seems incredibly prescient. How does COVID-19 impact a potential digital currency war?David Birch: I wouldn't have wished it this way, obviously, but yeah, COVID-19 might have done me a bit of a favor. You must admit that to somebody outside of the U.S., the idea that government stimulus money will arrive in the form of checks being mailed in the post to people seems odd. This is like having an economic stimulus for the Little House on the F--ing Prairie. It’s crazy. What the f--- are they doing mailing out checks to people? So the idea that the government could provide a stimulus just by sending money directly into people's wallets — not even into their bank accounts, but directly into their wallets — that’s really interesting. That might well provide an incredible stimulus to digital currency that none of us saw coming.See also: How a Flurry of ‘Digital Dollar’ Proposals Made It to CongressIn the book you consider the possibility of the U.S. dollar losing its dominance. What are the implications? Birch: I think you need to divide it into two categories. So there's what does it mean in financial terms? And of course, America's ability to denominate its own debt translates into a tremendous fiscal advantage. So if America couldn't do that, it couldn't just print its way out of problems. This is what General [Charles] de Gaulle rather famously referred to as America's “exorbitant privilege.” And that has implications for trade.But I think what’s more interesting are the non-financial implications.Such as?Birch: America's ability to exercise soft power. I stress that I’m not making a political point. But for example, do you remember a few months ago, America threatened to cut Turkey off? I can't even remember what the dispute was about...Who can? There were 17 crises between now and then! [Editor’s note: This would be the U.S. threatening to cut Turkey from an F-35 stealth fighter jet program.]Birch: Yeah, a lifetime of crises ago. But the point is that if I'm some country, and America says you have to do something I don't particularly want to do, I have to do it because otherwise I can no longer buy imports and I get cut off from the global financial system. But what if there was something that was a bit like money but it just wasn’t run by the Americans? Or let's say you're a country in Africa. You sell most of your oil to China, so you decide to price your oil in yuan. You sell your oil in digital yuan. The U.S. Treasury wants to sanction you for doing something, what do you care? You don't use their stupid dollars anymore. None of your money goes through the New York money central banks, so what do you care? There are several countries, I'm sure, that actively would like that to happen.How could this impact an average person? Birch: Let’s say you're a farmer in Africa. And you’re buying tractors and things from China, and you're buying fertilizer from China, and you're supplying food to Chinese companies that are building ports and whatever else things companies do.You’ve got the choice between getting paid in your local currency, which you may not be too happy about because it may be a little volatile — it may be depreciating or it may have currency controls attached to it. Or you could get paid in U.S. dollars, except you're not allowed to have a U.S. dollar bank account. And even if you did have a U.S. dollar bank account, when you decide to send some money to your cousin in Afghanistan you can't, because it gets blocked by the U.S. Treasury. Or maybe you have a wallet on your phone where you can store your Chinese digital currency. Given those choices, I can understand why a great many people, particularly along China's emerging Belt and Road, I can see why some of those people would make that choice. I'm sure you can, too. I personally feel that money is so important that it has to be under democratic control.In the book you talk about “Red vs. Blue,” and I totally got the Halo reference, by the way. Birch: It was Halo, yeah! [Laughs.] I thought it was hilarious but no one knew what I was talking about. I’m so old. It fell completely flat. I wanted to call the book “Red vs. Blue,” but my publisher, who knows a lot more about selling books than I do, said, “It’s absolutely meaningless. No one will know what you’re talking about.” So what does Red vs. Blue mean, outside of Halo? Birch: It's the difference between private and public. So if I take Facebucks, which is what I always call them… I think it's a much better name [than libra]. How come I know more about marketing than Mark Zuckerberg? I don't get it. If I take Facebucks, I take Facebucks because I think other people are going to take Facebucks. That's how money works. And there could be 2.5 billion people around the world who are perfectly happy to accept Facebucks. Zuckerberg said  his vision was that sending money would be just as easy as sending a photo. Well, if that were true, if that vision was realized, that would be great, right? I mean, everyone would use that, wouldn't they? So is that a bad thing? Well, you know, if you run a government and you want to have some control over things, you'd probably think that was a bad thing, right?I can see it argued either way…Birch: Now, if I'm the government, actually, I might be okay with that as long as certain criteria are met, like [know-your-customer]. But I can’t help but feeling… even if Facebook did that, I mean, would you have your salary paid in Facebook money? Right.Birch: Or If you get chucked out of Facebook, who's the ombudsman you call? You see people all the time get banned from Twitter and they can't figure out why. What would happen with Facebucks? Like, what happens if you wake up one morning and, all of a sudden, Facebook won't let you send money to anybody? What do you do about it?Or would this give Facebook too much “soft power,” a consideration you raise in the book? Birch: I personally feel that money is so important that it has to be under democratic control. Now, that's not the same thing as saying that money has to be run by the government, because I don't think I agree with that. But I do think money should be under democratic control. I'm sure you must get into this argument all the time with the bitcoin maximalists. Can you elaborate? Why is democratic control so important? Birch: Well, why don't you get one of the bitcoin guys to write an article which explains to me how you would respond to the COVID-19 pandemic? I mean, I've seen them on Twitter, and they’re like, “Well, it just means the people who didn’t save money will go to the wall.” This is teenage. It really is. It's angry white male West Coast teenage pseudo-libertarianism.In the book you talk about “very smart money,” which could involve not only cryptography but biometrics. How do you envision this? Birch: So smart money is money that has apps, right? Very smart money is money that has coordinated apps that function to the benefit of all of the stakeholders. Here's an example that I tried to use in the book. Suppose you have digital currency that's effectively anonymous, right? Like with z-cash, it can be either anonymous or non-anonymous. So I can send money to you anonymously. But if I send money to you anonymously, then when you receive the money, there's an automatic 20% withholding tax which goes to the government to compensate for criminality and money laundering, or that sort of thing. See also: Chris Giancarlo - Don’t Rush Digital Dollar During COVID-19 CrisisThe libertarians would love that! What’s another example?Birch: You could imagine money where, if both of us are behaving ourselves, then everything is anonymous. But if one of us does something wrong — like I steal your money and run away with it — then you can unblind the transactions. You can break the glass, basically. Interesting.Birch: I’ve always thought that the smart contract layer will be where the real innovation would come from, and I do still believe that. But now I've started to think, well, if those smart contracts were kind of coordinated and organized, then you could make money that's really smart. Not money that just has simple triggers, simple little apps. What if I introduced an Islamic money? And the Islamic money can never be used buy alcohol, for example? A lot of people would prefer to use that kind of money, right? Or a parent who gives an allowance to a kid that can’t be used to buy R-rated movies or whatever. That gets into money as censorship, and an Orwellian dark side pretty quickly… Birch: If the tools are there, people who are much cleverer than me will come up with some amazing applications, I'm sure.You’re a big proponent of having LOTS of currencies. What’s the benefit of this? Birch: If you only have one currency, and something goes wrong with it —  like inflation — then you’re stuck, right? But if there’s lots of currencies and those currencies are constantly competing to deliver what society wants, if one of them goes away, it doesn’t really matter.It's the old argument that goes back to the idea of the IBM dollar. If I want to send you IBM stock, it has to go through all sorts of intermediaries, clearings, settlements, T+3 [trade date plus three days] and everything else, right? But if I send you IBM money, the money goes from me to you, end of story. So it makes for a much cheaper infrastructure.So instead of having one kind of money and using it to buy different kinds of securities, you'd have lots of different kinds of money. And people say, ""Well, that would be really complicated to manage,"" but that's because they're thinking of doing it themselves. In reality, you wouldn’t be doing it yourself because it's very smart money.  The AI in your phone will take care of it for you. Money that’s designed for devices can be much smarter than money designed for people. What do you want people to take away from the book? What's the core idea?Birch:  Three things, really. First of all, to stop thinking about digital currency as some kind of nerd cryptographer/bitcoin nutter thing. It's a real thing and it needs to be taken seriously. Two, to develop a strategy for digital currency. Obviously, my strategy would be for the Bank of England to create a fantastic digital currency. I'm sure Michael [Casey] and other people’s strategies might be for some private companies to create a fantastic digital currency. For other people, it might be for the U.S. to create a fantastic digital currency. I'm not smart enough to know which should be the best strategy, but I'm smart enough to know there should be a strategy. And the third thing?That they should pay me enormous sums of money to come and talk about it in conferences, should there ever be conferences again in the rest of my lifetime.David Birch will be appearing at virtual Consensus Distributed May 11 at 9 a.m. ET.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

She is also an investor in early-stage startups with Slow Ventures.","We Americans love to complain about the economy, about policymakers, about bailouts, about the Federal Reserve. But whenever I travel abroad, I am struck by the immense privilege of having the U.S. dollar as my native currency. I have yet to find a cabbie, a hotel clerk or indeed a banker in any part of the world who will not gladly accept the greenback as a form of payment. In countries from Argentina to Zambia I have found demand for dollars when I have come up short on the local currency.The demand for dollars was never more evident to me than in the course of the research on Venezuela I conducted with my colleagues at the Open Money Initiative. We went into the research hoping to learn how tools and technologies like bitcoin were being used by Venezuelans facing the collapse of their own currencies. What we found over and over again was, instead, rampant demand for only one weapon in the face of hyperinflation: the U.S. dollar. See also: Jill Carlson - Don’t Apply 2008 Thinking to Today’s CrisisWe spoke to young entrepreneurs who leverage convoluted networks of friends and relatives to reach someone with a U.S. bank account through whom they can keep some of their wealth in greenbacks. We spoke with some of these account holders, de facto informal bankers for entire communities, who have to maintain paper records detailing their nephew’s girlfriend has $200 held in their account and their ex-wife has $50 with them. We spoke with moneychangers in Venezuela who work tirelessly to meet demand for U.S. dollars, even smuggling hoards of cash across the border.This demand for U.S. dollars is not only present in extreme circumstances, as in Venezuela, nor only at the level of the individual. It is most notable at the nation-state level. Since World War II, the U.S. has enjoyed the role of supplying the world’s reserve currency. This meant something different in 1944 than it does today, but the result is what matters here: the U.S. dollar is the standard unit of account for currencies and commodities globally. When central banks around the world seek to manage the strength of their local currencies, they do so relative to the dollar, buying or selling USD. When India imports oil from Iraq, that oil is priced in U.S. dollars. Dollars are everywhere.Thanks to these dynamics, many countries and international institutions also borrow in dollars. When Brazil or Indonesia or Ukraine borrows money from investors and creditors, they often do so in dollars as opposed to reals or rupiahs or hryvnias. This generally enables countries to borrow at a lower interest rate than they would otherwise be able to access. The images of deflation are fewer and less likely to strike fear into our hearts, but they should.This also means, however, these countries have a structural and ongoing demand for dollars because that is the currency they will have to use to pay off the interest and the principal on this debt. Countries and global corporations issuing dollar-denominated debt are exposed to currency risk: If the U.S. dollar appreciates materially relative to their local currencies (which represents the majority of the cash inflows), then these borrowers can find themselves in trouble. For this reason, most countries maintain dollar reserves. But these are not always sufficient to cover all of their dollar-denominated obligations, spurring further dollar demand.Last month, as the global implications of the COVID-19 pandemic became increasingly clear, the value of the dollar spiked. Hedge funds, retail investors, international borrowers and everyone in between made a dash for cash. As the world hurried to liquidate stocks and sell credit, it sought to liquidate these assets for one thing: U.S. dollars. In trading, a sale is never just a sale. It is also the purchase of something else. In this case, everyone was selling everything for dollars. In a world that already has high demand for dollars, due to both psychological and structural forces, the implications of strong dollar appreciation are enormous.See also: Money Reimagined: Demand for USD Stablecoins Foreshadows Financial DisruptionThe Federal Reserve, which is tasked with managing the supply of dollars in the world, did the only thing it could do in the face of this: turn on the taps. Over the course of just a few weeks, the U.S. central bank cut its target interest rate to zero, pledged unlimited asset purchases and implemented a slew of other measures that were absolutely unprecedented, even relative to the measures it took in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. These actions have been memorialized, and criticized, in the form of the popular meme: money printer go brrr.The idea behind the criticism is that the U.S. is abusing what Ray Dalio, in a Reddit AMA, recently called “the world’s most important asset,” the printing press of the world’s reserve currency. Critics implicitly liken the Fed’s unprecedented easy monetary policies (policies that seek to weaken the U.S. dollar) to the policies of Weimar Germany or Maduro’s Venezuela. They fear out-of-control inflation and an absence of political will to ever turn off the presses. Those fears may not be baseless over the long run, but even having spent a material part of my career researching inflationary crises, working in emerging markets and holding bitcoin, I’m not currently worried about excessive money printing.The fact is, we need the Federal Reserve’s money printer to BRRR right now. The U.S. dollar, over the last five years, has already maintained relative strength against global currencies. The economic crisis brought on by the outbreak and spread of COVID-19 has only further spurred this strength. What strength actually means here is a shortage of dollars relative to demand. If that demand is not met, then companies and countries around the world face a liquidity crisis. Dollar strength, if allowed to persist, can also result in long term deflation, which hurts economic growth at home.Denouncing excessive borrowing and money printing is a tempting stance based on the salience of images of hyperinflation: wheelbarrows of cash and trillion-dollar bills. The images of deflation are fewer and less likely to strike fear into our hearts, but they should. Condemning money printing is also enticing as a superior moral stance. It seems to advocate responsibility, accountability and rationality. In a world that is inherently short of dollars and is only becoming more so, refusing to increase supply is anything but responsible and rational.Someday, after a vaccine is found, when we are all once more commuting to work on the subway and toasting each other at bars, it will become important for the U.S. to find the political will to shut down its money printer. We will have to wind down that which, today, is necessary. We will have to hike interest rates. I am not confident that will happen. At that point, I will become concerned about dollar devaluation. But not today. Today we need to keep the dollars flowing.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

It issued a statement as far back as 2014, telling citizens they could not use digital assets such as bitcoin as a form of legal tender and warning of potential fraud.One of the goals of the BCRA-initiated proof-of-concept was also to demonstrate there are other viable use cases for blockchain technology besides cryptocurrencies, in particular using smart contracts.See also: French Central Bank Puts Out Call for Digital Currency ExperimentsThe new layer trialed by the BCRA runs along the same lines as a similar blockchain initiative, also based on RSK, hosted by the country's primary gas distributor earlier this year.

Over the next few weeks, that lockdown has extended to more than 200 million people. China-based blockchain investor Matthew Graham called living through it “the craziest thing I’d ever seen.” Yet, despite such a chaotic blow to the economy of the supply chain capital of the world, U.S. stock markets continued to mint new highs, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average reaching an all time high on Feb. 12 and the S&P 500 following suit exactly one week later. On Monday, Feb. 24, the dam started to break. Caitlin Long, founder of the crypto bank Avanti and 22-year Wall Street veteran, said COVID-19 was “starting to overwhelm the ability of central banks to solve this. … You can’t solve a pandemic with liquidity. It’s just not going to work.” That week would get messier still. By the end of the week, which completed a 10% drop from just 10 days earlier, crypto trader Scott Melker said, “This is a historic drop. This is something we haven’t seen since World War II.”By the first week in March, the Fed sprang into action, calling an emergency weekend meeting to announce a 50 basis point rate cut. Unfortunately, the market did the opposite of what the Fed might have hoped. Delphi Digital macro analyst Kevin Kelly put it this way: “What last week’s rate cut did was confirm to equity investors what they didn’t want to admit to themselves: that this was a real risk and something the Federal Reserve was watching as a real threat to economic activity.”See also: Money Reimagined: COVID-19’s Lessons in InnovationAs true fear crept into markets, the stage was now set for a torrent of action and intervention. In this first episode of Money Reimagined, we look at:The key question explored in this episode is what happens to the U.S. dollar next? On the one hand, monetary stimulus like the world has never seen suggests that at some point, we should anticipate an inflationary environment. On the other, the dollar has done nothing but grow stronger compared to other currencies. How can both of these things be true simultaneously?For that, we turn to insights from Matthew Graham, Caitlin Long, Scott Melker, Kevin Kelly, Ben Hunt, Luke Gromen, Travis Kling, Mark Yusko, Anthony Pompliano, Jared Dillian, Dave Portnoy, Michael Casey, Preston Pysh and Peter Zeihan.Music by DJ J-Scrilla ""Faith In My Money (Money Printer Go Brrr)"" from the new “Sound Money” album.Produced by NLW and Adam B.

In this episode of CoinDesk Live, hosted by Consensus organizer Stephanie Izquieta, Acevedo seemed to invoke the giving nature of early bitcoin enthusiasts such as Roger Ver, who would give away bitcoin to anyone and everyone he met. According to Acevedo, that’s the best way to get more people interested in the technology. They’ll not only be interested from a price perspective but become more curious about how crypto could offer efficiencies and benefits in other areas of their life. For people in lower-income communities that are unbanked or underbanked, it’s introducing a whole new concept of finance they didn’t have access to before.“The movement is so small but so, so powerful,” Acevedo said.Listen in to hear more about: Next up: CoinDesk Live: Lockdown Edition continues its popular twice-weekly virtual chats with Consensus speakers via Zoom and Twitter, giving you a preview of what’s to come at Consensus: Distributed, our first fully virtual – and fully free – big-tent conference May 11-15.Register to join our fifth session Thursday, April 30, with speaker Hudson Jameson from the Ethereum Foundation to discuss private transactions, client improvements and dealing with FUD, hosted by Consensus organizer Nolan Bauerle.

like Bitcoin and Ethereum are permissionless while Walmart's ...","May 1, 2020 at 16:51 UTC",Know your enemy. ,"Epidemiologists and drugmakers are now living out that maxim as they frantically study the pathology of a virus President Trump calls the “hidden enemy.”But learning about COVID-19 shouldn’t solely be about building a medical weapon against it. We can also take lessons from it as a society. Contemplating the virus’ “success” can help us design a more resilient economy and prepare for the dynamic digital financial system of the future. Before you write this off as the ramblings of a madman, note that biomimicry, or biomimetics – the study and imitation of nature to find solutions to complex human problems – enjoys a long and respected tradition. And, as per this Biomimicry Institute article, COVID-19 is a great entry point into the field. You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. You can subscribe to this and all of CoinDesk’s newsletters here.There’s a reason we habitually use words like “ecosystem” to describe economic systems. As with natural ecosystems, the complexity of an economy’s relationships creates relentless, unpredictable change. Yet, to thrive societies need stability – just as nature needs homeostasis. So, an economy’s success depends on its ability to adapt within that dynamic environment. In living systems, the key to homeostasis over time is evolution. The survivors of a disruptive change will be those members of a species with mutations that resist the threat. Those traits are then passed on through reproduction. Similarly, economies adapt to disruption and change by evolving – in essence, by innovating, and adopting new models. Those with the best foundational structure to innovate/evolve will thrive over time. This is where viruses are especially telling as biomimetic subjects. With a singular purpose to exploit the cells of living beings to replicate themselves, viruses are in a constant state of mutation. It’s part of their ongoing evolutionary struggle against our immune systems, which are themselves constantly adapting, using antigens installed by viruses to produce antibodies that repel them. Sometimes in this randomized, hit-or-miss process, the virus gets the upper hand. COVID-19 is one such winner.See also: Why the Dollar Has Never Been Stronger or More Set Up to FailThe COVID-19 mutation is so powerful because it’s focused on the social aspects of our existence. Two traits in particular have enabled it both to overcome millions of people’s immune systems and to disarm our most valuable disease-fighting weapon: our collective brain power.  The first is COVID-19’s highly contagious nature. The virus’ R0 – a measure of how many new infections stem from each case – was calculated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at a median level of 5.7 at the height of the Wuhan outbreak. It’s aided by a pre-symptom incubation period averaging six days, with victims typically becoming contagious at some point before then. Up to 50% of all cases may be asymptomatic, which fosters a high propensity for transmission by oblivious carriers. The second trait is more insidious: an inconsistency of outcomes that muddles our capacity to agree on how to respond. As New York City’s experience shows us, COVID-19’s estimated morbidity rate of 3%-7% of cases is high enough to overwhelm hospitals during outbreaks. Yet, for the vast majority of otherwise contagious patients, it’s virtually harmless, encouraging complacency toward social distancing and, in some places, outright “lockdown rebellion.”If COVID-19 were like the current-season flu, with a death rate of around 1%, our health system could have managed the patient load without quarantines and we could more safely have started the clinical trials needed to develop a vaccine. Conversely, if it were as brutal as, say, the 2014-2016 West African Ebola outbreak, in which 40% of victims died, there would have been overwhelming support early on for a total lockdown. Both a vaccine or total lockdown would have stopped the virus in its tracks, frustrating its replication ambitions. But COVID-19 allowed neither. In occupying the middle ground between harmless and lethal, it outwitted our collective decision-making systems. It’s as if COVID-19 ran a highly effective disinformation campaign.What can we learn from this remarkable phenomenon? What conditions do our economic and social systems need to adapt to such threats? How do we redirect factories and supply chains toward needed production and keep incomes flowing during times like this? How do we optimize our economy’s adaptive, innovative potential?When venture capitalist Marc Andreessen laments our incapacity to “build"" or journalist Jon Stokes observes that our economy is built for just-in-time efficiency but not for resilience, they’re describing an economic model that’s not optimized for innovation. We must strive for Nassem Taleb’s ideal of an “antifragile” system, a quick-action economic immune system with agility, backups, alternative paths to delivery and capacity to rapidly pivot. It requires a framework conducive to rapid-response innovation, to the societal equivalent of virus-like evolution.  Such a system must be open. It must allow the greatest variety of ideas a voice and a clear pathway to potential deployment. To continue with the metaphor of evolution, we’re looking for the widest possible gene pool, a big primordial soup from which the new life of innovation can spring. The answer lies in an open, decentralized, permissionless system. To understand the power of “permissionlessness,” look to the history of the internet. Applications built on open-access protocols such as TCP/IP for data-switching, HTTP for websites and SMTP for email proved overwhelmingly more popular and successful among both developers and users than closed online systems such as France’s Minitel and AOL. In the race to survive and thrive, the permissionless internet, which now boasts more than three billion users and more than a billion websites, easily out-evolved the corporate- and state-permissioned environments of those “Intranets.”The permissionless ideal was tarnished in the post-millennial Web 2.0 era, as Google, Amazon, Facebook and other powerful gatekeepers took control of the internet’s data, the digital age’s most important commodity. Hope now lies in a Web 3.0 phase founded on decentralized protocols inspired by cryptocurrency and blockchain models. These offer a vision in which no one needs permission from any one entity to exchange money, data or any other form of digital value. Yet, here, too, tension persists between permissionless and permissioned models. The latter is more easily scalable at this early development stage and companies and governments are reluctant to cede control. (For the sake of simple illustration, we can say decentralized blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum are permissionless while Walmart’s distributed ledger supply chain system is permissioned.)Now more than ever, as the COVID-19 crisis accelerates the arrival of digital, programmable currency and open blockchain solutions, the economic advantages of permissionless systems deserve a sound hearing. So far, China’s Blockchain Service Network (BSN) and Digital Currency Electronic Payments (DCEP) system seem miles ahead of the rest of the world. But while the BSN’s designers wisely allowed for interoperability with permissonless blockchains and assets, the system’s ultimate gatekeeper will always be the Chinese Communist Party. Here lies the West’s Internet 1.0-like opportunity to out-evolve China. In the 1990s, the United States actively promoted an open internet. Western allies now have a similar opportunity. They can create a regulatory environment that fosters permissionless standards for exchanging digital money and data, allowing developers to integrate useful applications into an open, digital financial system. Yet, the ultimate goal is not to beat China per se.The pandemic has revealed the shared dangers we face in the absence of a robust, adaptable economic and social system for dealing with such threats. Supporting the evolutionary power of a permissionless system is in all of humanity’s interest.Unless you’re spending quarantine under a rock, you would know bitcoin has been on a tear. What you might not know is that this is the fifth consecutive year bitcoin has rallied in April. The repeated trend, which tends to continue into the first half of May, has even spawned a meme: the “Consensus Pump.” That’s a nod to CoinDesk’s annual Consensus event, the most important crypto conference of the year, in the second week of May. (I shouldn’t need to say this but, to be absolutely clear, CoinDesk’s editorial team is in no way “pumping” bitcoin, and we make no investment recommendations.) It’s possible this pattern is merely a more extreme version of what often happens in the lead-up to summer on Wall Street, where an old stockbroker’s adage tells investors to “Sell in May and Stay Away.” Either way, I cannot deny the confluence of the price run-up and the bitcoin halving is making us even more excited to be putting on Consensus: Distributed, our entirely virtual version of the big event May 11-15. Register here.A small Italian town has started creating its own banknotes. According to euronews and Associated Press, Enrico Fratangelo, mayor of Castellino del Biferno (population: 550), has been studying the idea for 12 years. But it was Italy’s severe COVID-19 lockdown that pushed him to launch the “Ducati” notes. “We decided to mint money to make sure the local economy could withstand the impact of the situation,” Fratangelo told the AP in an interview. In doing so, he was following a tradition of community currencies such as ""the Brixton Pound,” the “Ithaca Hours,” and the “Patacones” that Buenos Aires Province issued in the midst of Argentina’s crisis. Sometimes, these ideas are founded on “local-first” movements to keep money inside the community; sometimes it’s out of desperation, when cash shortages demand a new medium of exchange. Either way, it’s a concept ripe for a COVID-19-era move toward programmable digital currency, combining a backlash against failed centralized power and desperate needs for liquidity with the power to create money out of software. Already, blockchain ventures like Bancor are building tools for communities to issue digital local currencies. As talk of digital fiat currency grows, “programmable money” is becoming a buzzword. But what does it actually mean? Antony Lewis, author of the acclaimed “The Basics of Bitcoin and Blockchain,” has made a useful stab at defining the taxonomy. Lewis, who recently left bank-led distributed ledger consortium R3 to join Singapore-owned Temasek, makes the critical point that the mere existence of a computer interface for payment commands is insufficient for money to be “programmable.” What matters is that no third-party computer, such as a bank’s, can interfere with the coded commands from payer to payee. It’s a prerequisite for what he smartly calls “designer money.” To me, what ultimately matters is for the payer and payee to trust an intermediary won’t intervene in their transaction. So I don’t yet agree with Lewis that “programmable” can’t apply to stablecoins that are managed by blockchain-based smart contracts whose logic allows them to block the payment in special cases. By that standard, a central bank digital currency would not be programmable, either. Maybe the jury is still out. It will depend on whether users sufficiently trust the model to use them programmably. A big deal, folks: China’s Blockchain Services Network has launched. After CoinDesk’s David Pan broke important news on the makeup and key players behind the BSN and we published a pro-BSN opinion piece by Fudan University academic Michael Sung, some on Crypto Twitter scoffed. “It’s not a blockchain,” some said. “We already have bitcoin,” others added. For sure, what China is building is a long way from the permissionless, governmentless vision behind bitcoin. And, as I argued above, permissionlessness should ultimately win. But to dismiss this grand project as dead on arrival is dangerously naive. The design, with its use of Hyperledger and Cosmos technology to build an interoperable framework and toolkit for companies and cities to cheaply and easily build and interlock their operations, is quite stunning for its scope. Yes, it could enable a frightening “panopticon” surveillance apparatus – despite privacy promises from BSN architects. But that doesn’t mean it won’t succeed in driving an economic leapfrog. Whether we like it or not, China is leading the way in reimagining money.CoinDesk Live: Lockdown Edition continues its popular twice-weekly virtual chats via Zoom and Twitter, giving you a preview of what’s to come at Consensus: Distributed, our first fully virtual - and fully free - big-tent conference May 11-15. Register to join our sixth session Tuesday, May 5, with speaker Amy Davine Kim from the Chamber of Digital Commerce to discuss upcoming guidelines from the Financial Action Task Force, most notably the Travel Rule, hosted by Consensus organizer Aaron Stanley.

and ...","Apr 22, 2020 at 09:20 UTC",Rogue miners submitted phony price data that tricked decentralized stablecoin network PegNet into turning a small wallet balance into a $6.7 million stash.,"At approximately 05:00 UTC Tuesday morning, four mining entities – which together comprised as much as 70 percent of the PegNet hashrate – submitted data that artificially inflated the price of a ""pJPY,"" a stablecoin pegged to the price of Japanese yen, according to a core developer going by the username ""WhoSoup.""Beginning initially with a wallet balance of $11, the group pushed the price of pJPY up to $6.7 million and then transferred it into pUSD – PegNet's USD-linked stablecoin. They then tried (unsuccessfully) to liquidate as much as possible on spot exchanges and distribute the remainder in hundreds of different wallet addresses. PegNet is a decentralized network, built on top of the Factom protocol, where users can trade stablecoins pegged to 42 assets. Besides fiat currencies, there are also digital assets pegged to commodities, such as gold, and other cryptocurrencies including bitcoin and ether. See also: Hacker Exploits Flaw in Decentralized Bitcoin Exchange Bisq to Steal $250KThe network relies on miners to submit price data collected from a series of oracles and APIs to keep stablecoin prices pegged to their fiat equivalents. Each block requires up to 50 data points, and the protocol discards the 25 submissions furthest away from the total average. Most use the third to fourth default sources, but miners are also able to submit their own arbitrary values.""WhoSoup"" told CoinDesk this isn't normally a problem as the system works to incentivize miners – with a block reward – to submit price data in line with those of other submissions.Over Discord, the developer explained the miners essentially performed a form of 51 percent attack by submitting 35 of the top 50 price submissions, skewing the average in their favor and meaning that the remaining 15 price submissions were discarded as outliers.With the fake exchange rate, the miners converted the inflated pJPY into pUSD so the overall wallet balance rose from $11 worth of pJPY tokens to well over 6.7 million pUSD which, assuming accurate price data, should be worth $6.7 million. Tuesday's attack lasted about 20 minutes and apparently did not affect other users' funds.David Johnston, who as well as being Factom Inc. chairman is also one of the main figures behind PegNet, told CoinDesk that group had no control over transactions and conversion of other users, but could only confirm price data. ""This attacker seems to have only affected their own wallet,"" he said.Johnston added that the attacker had not been able to transfer much of the pUSD into the PegNET's native PEG cryptocurrency, as the protocol's software doesn't allow quick conversions. ""This person was able to generate a bunch of pAssets, but not able to convert them into PEG and dump on the market,"" he said.The way PegNet is configured means the identity of individuals controlling the mining entities cannot be known.

The attacker has since reached out to PegNet and claimed they were only trying to ""pentest [penetration test] the network and code logic,"" to identify potential vulnerabilities and notify core developers. They have also destroyed all the stablecoins in question, sending them all to the PegNet burn address at roughly 14:00 UTC Tuesday. Both Who and Johnston refused to be drawn on the motives behind the attack. ""I can't speak to intent of this person just their actions,"" Johnston said. ""Their actions were to generate the pAssets and then destroy those pAssets. [It] seems like more of a stunt than an attack given the short time it lasted and their actions since.""The attacker's decision to burn the assets seems to mirror the actions of the hacker who drained dForce of $25 million at the weekend and then handed back stolen assets after learning Singaporean authorities had their IP address. Johnston said PegNet would now review some of its oracle mechanisms, to ensure they are robust enough to withstand these sorts of attacks again in the future.

Allied Irish Banks (AIB) notified the firm last August it was closing 
its ...","May 6, 2020 at 14:27 UTC",An Irish crypto company said its business suffered after one of the country's largest banks shut down its account. ,"Bryan Tierney, founder of bitcoin ATM operator Boinnex, told CoinDesk Allied Irish Banks (AIB) notified the firm last August it was closing its account – initially without any official reason. It was only when Tierney put the account into an arranged overdraft – which precluded the bank from closing the account – that AIB sent an explanation in writing. Dated Oct. 10, AIB's letter said the account was being closed because ""the market for Cryptocurrencies in ROI [Republic of Ireland] remains unregulated"" and remains unrecognized as money or legal tender by the Central Bank of Ireland (CBI).While the European Union's fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (5AMLD) – which requires crypto companies to register with local regulators and hold information on clients' source of funds – would ""impose new requirements"" on crypto businesses, according to the letter, it hadn't been implemented at the time. ""This type of business activity [emphasis theirs] is outside of our risk appetite at this time,"" AIB concluded. Although Ireland was set to transpose 5AMLD over into local law along with the rest of Europe in January, this still hasn't taken place. A tie among three of the main political parties in a general election earlier this year has left the country without a government majority. With the coronavirus now a national priority, it's unlikely 5AMLD will be transposed until much later this year.For Irish cryptocurrency companies like Boinnex, the delay in 5AMLD means they are left without access to mainstream financial services. A legislative draft has been publicized, but until it's enacted businesses will remain stuck in a kind of regulatory limbo.Boinnex spent thousands of euros making sure they were compliant with the 5AMLD requirements, according to Tierney. Although the team is only three people full-time, they still had to bring on a part-time compliance officer to assist those efforts.See also: India’s Supreme Court Lifts Banking Ban on Crypto ExchangesBoinnex had been forced to close for six weeks after AIB closed its account. While he had hoped to find a local banking partner, Tierney said he came to the conclusion that ""you can't bank if you're a cryptocurrency company in Ireland at the moment.""In the end, the firm reluctantly went to a specialist bank in Lithuania, called Mistertango, and set up a relationship there. Soon, though, Lithuanian regulators fined the bank €250,000 for ""systemic"" violations to AML and counter-terrorist financing laws, which led Mistertango to close its doors. “I was quite reluctant to use Mistertango, basically because I’d heard bad things in terms of their reputation. At the time it was the only show [crypto-friendly bank] in town so we ended up paying a couple of thousand and then within a couple of months it was closed.”Boinnex said it now has a reliable banking partner for the crypto business, as well as a Bank of Ireland (BOI) account allowing the payment of salaries and anything else that doesn't touch the crypto part of the business. ""I know three other companies that had Bank of Ireland accounts that were closed,"" Tierney said, ""we wouldn't take that chance.""In a statement to CoinDesk, an AIB spokesperson said the bank didn't have a policy against crypto companies. They added that they required all clients to follow local AML and know-your-customer requirements. ""We cannot open accounts for customers who are unable to comply with these regulations,"" they said.  See also: Facebook Affirms Libra Commitment With 50 New Job Openings in IrelandThis isn't an isolated incident; other Irish crypto businesses have faced similar issues. Fellow exchange BitIreland said it also had an AIB account closed back in 2018. A spokesperson said the firm was now forced to pay ""insane monthly amounts"" to use a payments account from an offshore bank, and is now planning on selling the business. Crypto exchange Bitcove told CoinDesk it has held accounts with all the major Irish banks, including AIB and BOI, but they had all been closed down. ""We were actually awarded a start-up business award by Bank of Ireland, only to have our account closed a few short months later,"" a spokesperson said. ""The Irish banks were never interested in our AML policies, even when we tried to show them how our operations were fully compliant.""One business owner, who asked he and his business remain unnamed, said they had considered setting themselves up in Ireland but had gone elsewhere because he found banks weren't willing to work with crypto firms. ""We looked a couple of years ago and went elsewhere as all the vibes in the market were that it was too difficult,"" he said. See also: Coinbase Custody Goes International With New Entity in IrelandTierney is still annoyed by AIB's decision to close the Boinnex account because it caused disruption to his business. What makes it worse, he said, is the Irish government has been trying to promote the country as an ideal destination for crypto businesses but has done little to work with existing industry players. In an interview with the Irish Times last year, Irish Finance Minister Pascal Donoughue said the government “fully supports the development and adoption of new technologies like blockchain, as a way to encourage digitalization and foster innovation.” At the time, Lory Kehoe, managing director of ConsenSys Ireland, accused the government of failing to take the new technology seriously.

bitcoin, ...","Apr 21, 2020 at 17:25 UTC",Framework Ventures – a fund focused on decentralized finance (DeFi) plays including Synthetix and Chainlink – has purchased between 1 percent and 5 percent of all Kava tokens.,"Announced Tuesday, the token deal, valued at $750,000, comes ahead of Kava’s launch next month. Similar to DeFi platform MakerDAO, Kava will allow users to create collateralized debt positions (CDPs) on the Kava protocol in exchange for a stablecoin, USDX, pegged one-to-one with the U.S. dollar.Unlike the predominantly ether-focused MakerDAO, Kava will work with most any digital asset, or at least that’s the plan, according to Kava Labs CEO Brian Kerr. Kava is built on the Tendermint consensus algorithm, which is also employed by the Cosmos, the blockchain interoperability project. As a result, Kava “should be able to seamlessly bridge to any other blockchain,” Kerr said.Kava will begin with BNB, the native token of the Binance ecosystem, and branch into XRP and bitcoin. Kava conducted an initial exchange offering (IEO) on Binance in October and counts Arrington XRP Capital as an investor.Kerr said the firm will add bitcoin as the technical capabilities become possible. A key struggle remains the multi-signature structure for bitcoin, which does not easily lend itself to DeFi products. Bitcoin’s upcoming Schnorr and Taproot updates will make the addition more seamless, Kerr said.Before the launch, Framework Ventures advised Kava on its token inflation model and plans to provide continued technical support for the Kava team, Framework co-founder Michael Anderson told CoinDesk in an interview.“As the network launches and we can see the token economics for the product in motion, in many cases, just like with Synthetix or Chainlink, we will double down,” Anderson said of his firm’s investment strategy.Kava’s launch has been preceded by turbulent weather in the DeFi space.Lendf.me, a protocol in the dForce ecosystem, lost 99 percent of its funds through a hacking exploit in a single night (which has now been returned). A month before that, DeFi in general faced its biggest test yet when ETH prices tumbled on March 12 causing many systems to fail or become overly stressed.One of the biggest losers on that day was MakerDAO, whose infrastructure proved less robust than previously thought. The finance platform accrued debt that had to be bailed out by venture capital firms. Lingering stability issues with dai’s dollar peg have persisted for weeks. A class-action lawsuit filed in the Northern District Court of California against the Maker Foundation for negligence was the cherry on top.Kerr said the difference for Kava lays in a codebase with limited functionality compared to DeFi protocols like MakerDAO. In other words, Kerr said, the less your system can do, the safer your system is.“[Kava] can liquidate and auction, but that's it. It's very specific purposes – there isn't any other functionality that can be built into what we've done. That allows us to thoroughly test it so we can have a very strong confidence level that there's no sort of open exploits available,” Kerr said.Either way, Kava is joining a crowded room as interest in DeFi appears to grow. Projects like MakerDAO are adding assets to the mix, with Brave’s Basic Attention Token (BAT) and the Coinbase-supported USDC stablecoin added as forms of loan collateral in recent months. Projects are experimenting with bringing in BTC-pegged assets to kickstart DeFi on the Tezos blockchain. However, Kerr said there is still plenty of room for the sector to grow.“We were kind of scratching our heads for why the same [DeFi] services weren't available to all the other cryptocurrency communities. It really comes down to the technology hasn't been built yet. … These other blockchains don't have the smart-contract capabilities to support it natively.”The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

volatility of cryptos like bitcoin has made this vision impossible, to date.","Apr 30, 2020 at 18:23 UTC","George Calle is Market Intelligence Lead at R3, an enterprise blockchain software firm. ","In just a few short years, digital currencies have progressed hugely. But while the early adopters of cryptocurrencies dreamed of entirely new digital coins transforming the way we pay for things, the volatility of cryptos like bitcoin has made this vision impossible, to date. As a result, the most common retail use for digital currencies is speculative trading.Yet, the underlying technology has been adopted by the largest financial institutions in the world, providing significant efficiencies and opening new business opportunities. Now, even the world’s central banks are looking at how to bring blockchain-based payment tokens back to the retail markets. Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) are in active pilot across the world (see our recent report). The People’s Bank of China has its digital yuan project and Sweden’s central bank, Sveriges Riksbank, has announced a pilot for a digital version of its currency for retail use, dubbed the e-krona. The U.S. Federal Reserve, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank are all exploring the technology.See also: Ajit Tripathi - 4 Reasons Central Banks Should Launch Retail Digital CurrenciesThe global pandemic has given additional impetus to this trend. The Bank for International Settlements (BIS), the so-called “central banks’ central bank,” recently said contaminated bills may be the catalyst for central banks to deliver a digital cash alternative for payments. Similarly, members of the U.S. Congress have recently called for a “digital dollar.”In part, central banks are responding to challenges from private-sector initiatives, such as the Facebook-backed Libra Association. In addition, CBDCs also suggest substantial benefits for general purpose use which make them highly attractive in their own right. The digital nature of the currencies will modernize payments, making them more efficient and financially inclusive. Additionally, depending on the implementation, they could lead to a more transparent retail payment system, reducing black market trade. Meanwhile, central banks may benefit from easier facilitation of monetary policy and an increase in revenues. Recent CBDC models take a collaborative approach with the private sector. For example, the Bank of England is researching what it calls the “platform model” in which the central bank is the only entity allowed to create or destroy a token, while leaving “payment interface providers” (PIPs) to interact with end users. The proposal gives PIPs the responsibility to maintain Know-Your-Customer (KYC) checks, while providing them with the freedom to build customer relationships and differentiate themselves by providing additional services on top of the core payments. Others have gone a step further. Researchers at the International Monetary Fund recently coined the term synthetic CBDC (sCBDC) to describe a model in which a non-central bank entity, such as a commercial bank, can issue a stablecoin backed by central bank reserves.The most common retail use for digital currencies is speculative trading.Blockchain is crucial in enabling the tokenization of payment assets, allowing for peer-to-peer transactions and distributed custody. Additionally, blockchain enables atomic transactions, which means any conditional payment scenario, such as the delivery of a security in exchange for payment (DvP), can occur, in real time, without risk that one leg of the transaction will execute before the other.Digitizing the payment methods on blockchain enables easy connectivity into a growing tokenized financial ecosystem. This could include the facilitation of faster and cheaper cross-border payments, as well as tying CBDCs into other token uses, such as the new crop of ‘digital exchanges’ using blockchain to combine trading and post-trade services into a seamless whole. For example, the Swiss National Bank is working with the SIX Digital Exchange to explore how market participants can settle tokenized assets on the exchange with central bank money.See also: Inside China’s Plan to Power Global Blockchain AdoptionFinally, blockchain also sets the architecture for a more secure payment system in which there is no centralized point of failure for hackers to attack.Looking forward, we can imagine a completely new architecture for money – a step change as significant as the invention of the credit card. Widespread access to CBDC will be key for central banks to fulfill their mandate of offering modern payments solutions. Additionally, it will catalyze connectivity between the general public, corporations and the financial industry with parallel innovations currently being built out by firms leveraging blockchain in non-payments related areas, such as tokenized exchanges or HQLAx’s collateral and liquidity management platform as just two examples. Central banks have a tremendous opportunity to orchestrate and provide purchasing power into this ecosystem.Ultimately, we are likely to see a variety of uses for CBDCs in the retail space and a number of different implementations. Some central banks will issue CBDC directly to the general public. In other cases, a financial institution with a central bank account could issue stablecoins backed by reserves. Additionally, access may be facilitated through a network of financial institutions and payment companies that distribute CBDC to their customers.In such a model, the job of the designated provider would be to manage and monetize that client relationship and deliver a superior user experience, in competition with other designated financial institutions, fintechs or payment companies. It provides the benefits of tokenized money to those who want it, and the benefits of simple account based services to those who don’t want to manage private keys.Whatever the exact CBDC implementation in the retail space, it will have important benefits for a wide variety of institutions, from banks to corporate treasury departments to payment networks open to the general public.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

With $2.3 billion in total assets, it’s less than 1% the size of JPMorgan Chase’s $3.1 trillion in assets. Read more: Crypto-Friendly Silvergate Bank Goes Public on New York Stock ExchangeThe bank now has 850 digital currency customers, including 61 exchanges, 541 institutional investors and 248 other customers. The largest customer segment increase was in institutional investors, which increased by 32. The bank also claims to have more than 200 prospective clients in its pipeline. Deposits from digital currency customers increased by 35% to around $1.7 billion, making up the majority of the bank’s total $2 billion deposits. Other deposits at the bank decreased by around 45%. Average balance of deposits was up by only $100 million while deposits for period end were up $400 million, because of institutional investors putting more cash back into their accounts, CEO Alan Lane said on an earnings call Wednesday. The bank’s cost of deposits continued to rise from .84% in the fourth quarter of 2019 to .87% in the first quarter of 2020. This is around the average for mid-cap commercial banks and is up from the first quarter of 2019 when the cost of deposits was .08%. Fee income from digital currency customers increased by more than $300,000. In an earnings call, Lane said that each of the fees for the bank remained flat or increased this past quarter. Last quarter fee income and deposits dropped, even while the bank was adding more customers. Read more: Silvergate Bank Adds 48 Crypto Clients in Q4 Even as Deposits Slip 4%The bank’s net income was $4.4 million, up by 22% from last quarter but down 53% from the same time last year. The bank’s Silvergate Exchange Network (SEN) handled 31,405 transactions in the first quarter compared to 14,400 transactions in fourth quarter of 2019. This was more than triple what the number of transactions were on the SEN a year ago. SEN’s volume increased by $7.8 billion to $17.4 billion total in the first quarter.The network allows commercial customers to instantly move U.S. dollars between different crypto exchanges and remains open on nights and weekends, unlike traditional markets.The bank plans to add more products to the SEN in the future, including a bitcoin-on-margin lending feature called SEN Leverage which is currently in pilot mode. The bank has approved $12.5 million in bitcoin collateralized loans so far and plans to roll out the product in 2020.In the earnings call, Lane said the bank continues to explore product options around crypto custody and settlement. In response to analyst questions, Lane also said the bank is exploring whether or not it should play a “more active role” in the stablecoin space, beyond just offering basic banking services to stablecoin issuers.In answer to a question about how Silvergate might benefit from the launch of Libra, Silvergate executive vice president of corporate development Ben Reynolds said that the bank offers cash management products for quickly transferring fiat to stablecoin.“I think it’s fair to characterize this as we’re investigating it and keeping our options open in working with all stablecoin participants,” he added. The bank also kept a high risk-based capital ratio – total capital to risk-based assets – in the first quarter, staying around 26% where other banks are normally around 12% to 14%, said Mike Perito, a bank stock analyst at investment firm Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.The bank also established a referral partnership with Seacoast Commerce Bank in National City, Calif., for customers seeking assistance under the U.S. government’s Paycheck Protection Program. Neither Silvergate nor Seacoast broke out how many, if any, of Silvergate’s crypto clients applied for PPP loans.Silvergate also increased its provision for loan losses to $400,000, compared to no provision for the fourth quarter of 2019. While the bank serves the crypto industry on the deposit side, it turns those deposits into interest-bearing deposits at other banks, investment securities and loans.Like many traditional banks, Silvergate’s largest segment of loans are made up of commercial real estate and one- to four-family real estate loans. Because of the bank’s low loan-to-value margins and its low exposure to the hospitality and retail space, none of its modified loans have been considered troubled debt under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, Lane said.Silvergate holds a fiscally conservative position so it can focus on building out products for the crypto sector, he added.“While the outlook of the economy remains uncertain, our first-quarter results clearly demonstrate the steps we have taken to prepare for a digital world,” Lane said.

Events.","Apr 21, 2020 at 09:20 UTC","The Blockchain Association has filed a “friend of the court” brief in the ongoing legal case between the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and messaging startup Kik, arguing the firm's kin token is not a security.","The advocacy group argues the SEC is wrongfully conflating Kik's 2017 exempt offering of securities to accredited investors with the issuance of blockchain tokens in its brief, filed Friday.Rather, Kik arranged its token sale in two parts: a private SAFT (Simple Agreement for Future Tokens) and a public token sale, the association wrote in a blog post on its filing. For the SAFT, Kik filed for a Regulation D exemption.The brief cites one SEC commissioner, Hester Pierce, who wrote in her “safe haven” proposal that “conflating the two concepts [of the investment contract and the underlying asset] has limited secondary trading and has had disastrous consequences for the ability of token networks to become functional.”""The Blockchain Association is troubled that the SEC’s recent arguments have conflated entering into a contract with accredited investors under a well-established exemption with other events involving the sale or distribution of tokens to the public,"" the association's executive director, Kristin Smith, told CoinDesk. ""In consistent statements, the SEC’s leadership, including Bill Hinman and Jay Clayton, had previously made clear that something that is a security at one point in time can later become a non-security – for example, when a network is sufficiently decentralized or fully functional,"" she said.The argument comes fresh on the heels of a ruling on the case between the SEC and messaging platform Telegram, and the gram tokens it had planned to issue for its Telegram Open Network (TON) blockchain. In late February, a New York court ruled in favor of the SEC, agreeing the sale of the future tokens to accredited investors by Telegram and the inevitable re-sale of those tokens to the broad public were two parts of the same distribution scheme and was therefore a securities transaction. However, the judge did not say gram tokens were themselves securities (a footnote clarifies the judge did not make a ruling one way or another on that front). “The wealthy purchasers who obtained large quantities of Kin at a significant discount were but a first step to a broader distribution to the public – in which purchasers planned to and did participate,” the SEC said when it filed motion for summary judgment on March 20. The Blockchain Association believes the ruling should not apply: “The Court should not adopt the novel theory advanced in the recent Telegram decision: that complying with existing securities exemptions by contracting with sophisticated accredited investors amounts to a 'scheme' to distribute unregistered securities to the public at some point in the future.”However, Smith believes that whatever the court decides about Kik, this won't necessarily affect the entire token industry in the end: ""As with the Telegram lawsuit, even if the court finds in favor of the SEC in this case, that does not necessarily have implications for the SAFT model in general.""See also: CFTC Approves Bitnomial to Offer Futures Contracts Settled in Real BitcoinThe Blockchain Association has already filed two amicus briefs in support of Telegram, arguing the SEC should not threaten the innovation punishing the company for trying to comply with the regulation, i.e., selling tokens to accredited investors only and filing for an exemption. The SEC's case against Kik began last June. In the following months, Kik shut down its messaging app, in which the kin token had been planned to be integrated, and sold it to a company called MediaLab. With the court ruling still pending, both the SEC and Kik filed motions for summary judgement at the end of March, asking for a ruling without full trial.  Read the full brief below:The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

","Speaking on Google Hangouts, AVA Labs COO Kevin Sekniqi told CoinDesk the company was focusing its energies on a new grants program, made available through its venture arm, AVA X, that will provide financing of up to $250,000 to selected projects building with its technology.AVA has earmarked a ""pretty substantial"" amount of cash for projects and initiatives that build out the ecosystem, Sekniqi said. Half of AVA Labs' allocation of mainnet tokens – with a value ""in the many millions of dollars"" – would also be available to selected projects as grants, he added. The AVA platform is a highly scalable protocol with a claimed thousands of transactions per second throughput – designed to be the basis for a new type of financial infrastructure. Founded by Cornell Professor Emin Gun Sirer, who has previously worked on a scaling solution for bitcoin, AVA had been in private testnet for over a year. It originally had been slated for launch as early as December but this was pushed back until April. The project is now aiming for a full launch sometime in July, according to its roadmap.Since the public testnet launch earlier this month, Sekniqi said the team had been in dialogue with at least five projects interested in applying for grants.See also: Multi-Chain DeFi Protocol Raises $750K in Token Sale With Framework VenturesThis sudden ramping up in grants comes as AVA solidifies in the approach to launch. It's even started to proselytize, offering its own vision of what the nascent decentralized finance (DeFi) space should start to look like going forward. ""There is nothing about [DeFi], to be totally honest with you, that is decentralized,"" Sekniqi said, as evidenced by the reality of hacks like the attack on dForce at the weekend. DeFi, he added, is just as susceptible to fallible people and relationships built on trust as traditional finance.However, debates about decentralization detract from DeFi's real killer app: the compatibility and programmability of capital and new financial products, according to Sekniqi. ""Ethereum has effectively shown that there huge power in composability and if you do make financial products standardized then you can compose them in all kinds of new and interesting ways that we've never thought of before,"" he said.Left to its own devices, DeFi would only rediscover all the ""basic instruments that have been known about for many years"" in traditional finance.

This one virtual viewing room was just the beginning for an industry kneecapped by shelter-in-place and social distancing mandates, the New York Times reported. This step towards democratizing access to art comes with its own handicaps. Physical artifacts brought online have a tendency to be reproduced and defaced. A once unique masterpiece – priceless in theory – becomes worthless if you can’t prove its authenticity, trust the seller or stop its forgery.See also: New App Lets You Create Instant Crypto Collectibles“If you’re buying in a digital showroom from a competent dealer, there’s a certain level of trust,” Harry Rinker, founder of Rinker Consulting, an appraisal firm specializing in antiques, art and collectibles, said in an interview. “But the truth is there are so many digital auction sites … there’s a certain risk for the average collector to be burned.”As the traditional, $67.4 billion art market learns to adapt to this weird interlude – where time seems refracted and human connection is made impossible – the nascent industry of blockchain-based art galleries is seeing its value tested in real time. Long predicted as an inevitable disruptor to the art market, blockchain is now a potential lifeline as all art goes digital.Just as bitcoin paved the way for trustless, peer-to-peer transactions by creating a shared ledger of events, crypto art, typically appended to the Ethereum blockchain as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), has provenance built in. This transparent, immutable record of ownership is not only central to a functioning digital art economy but an improvement on a market that long relied on paper certificates, or sometimes PDF reproductions, of authenticity. This is a new way of collecting art that makes a lot of sense in the digital age.“This is a new way of collecting art that makes a lot of sense in the digital age,” said Max Osiris, an early buyer of NFTs. “The transactions are nearly instant, proof of ownership and provenance are obvious, the market is open 24/7 and there's no geographical boundaries to who can create or collect art.”What’s more, the same properties of cryptocurrencies that prevent double-spending ensure each work of crypto art is made digitally scarce, and therefore valuable. That’s the thinking behind Nifty Gateway, a platform for the curation and sale of crypto art. Bought out last November by the crypto exchange giant Gemini, the firm has since hosted its first three “drops,” or exhibitions of one-of-a-kind digital artifacts. All have sold out within days of launch. “We got a little lucky timing. I think people are spending more time with their computers and are really beginning to look seriously at digital arts for the first time,” said Duncan Cock Foster, the firm’s co-founder. Founded with his twin brother Griffin as a paired-down tool to let people buy NFTs with their credit cards, Gemini’s backend now allows the platform to support a secondary market for trading NFT creations. It’s this innovation that’s making Nifty a legitimate counterweight to the troublesome situation of being an art collector under quarantine, and opening the possibility for new types of investing.Art and collectibles are often categorized  “alternative investments.” As tangible goods, they are considered inflation-resistant assets like gold, land and even bitcoin. But unlike other safe havens rocked by recent market turbulence, collectibles have largely held their ground. “The market is controlled by investors,” Rinker said, speaking about the wider collectible economy. He did note that prices collapsed during recessions in 2008 and in the late 1980s after cash-strapped buyers exited. “Any market is only viable if it allows buyers to recover cash from one sale to another,” he said. After only a month in operation, the works sold on Nifty's secondary market have seen a steady increase in value. A piece called “Wings: Regular” created by New York-based pen-and-ink-gone-NFT artist John Guydo, listed in Nifty’s first drop for $20 is now selling for $250. Other works, taken in aggregate, have seen doubling in valuations, Griffin Cock Foster said. See also: Davos, CBDCs, and the Rise of Bitcoin ArtThis is in spite of an NFT market that has been hollowed out in recent years. Both Cryptokitties and CryptoPunks, the latter once popular enough to hang in Zurich’s Kate Vass Galerie, see abysmal transaction volume compared to their 2017 highs. “According to my experience, it takes 30 years to create a viable secondary market. So anyone buying this stuff coming out new, has better expect to live for 30 years at least to see how it does. And my guess is that it won't do very well,” Rinker said. (It’s worth noting that Rinker earned the epithet “Beanie Meanie” for calling the top of the Beanie Baby bubble, to which bitcoin is often compared.)The Cock Foster twins have had a quality draw of the artists on display. The firm’s enigmatic owners, the Winklevoss twins, were able to rope in their photographer friend Lyle Owerko, who earned a reputation capturing the scene of the 21st century’s first crisis: the 9/11 attack on the World Trade Center. Art is only collected by incredibly wealthy people, like rappers and bankers, yet [artists are] followed and adored by people that can't afford their art.The craft of photography is as much a science as an art, which goes a long way in explaining why Owerko was attracted to making nifties. But he was also attracted by the prospect of reconnecting with an audience that can no longer afford his work.  “If the internet is the new gallery … then the only barrier is your choice whether to buy or not, not the velvet ropes of the traditional taste makers,” Owerko said. It was Owerko's exhibition and praise for the platform that initially interested the founding creative director for Def Jam Recordings Cey Adams to participate in the latest Nifty drop.""The stuff is moving fine,"" Adams said of his pop-art imbued brand of graphic design. In a little less than a week, buyers have snatched the highest cost and most limited prints in his ""Numbers"" exhibition. ""I'm still trying to wrap my mind around these people who care about this, why they care, and how anyone even knows about this,"" he said. Taking cues from the shuttered-for-now physical art galleries, Nifty is looking to run a show every two to three weeks, “and build a reputation as a gallery that displays high quality work consistently,” Duncan Cock Foster said. Browsing through the digital exhibitions, I was intrigued. Cey Adams's work reminded me of a painting I had seen hanging in the galleries of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, long before it closed its doors.  But what makes an NFT “high quality?” Where is the value in a digital reproduction, even if it’s one-of-a-kind and signed by a renowned artist? The Cock Foster twins said they don’t have access to much biographical information of Nifty users, but suspect they’re in their 30s, male and “interested in art and technology.”Rinker, a man in his late 70s, said, “What do I want with a digital collection? Where’s the fun in something if you can’t hold it, play with it, and caress it.” Ryan Colditz, a crypto artist who works under the name Coldie, thinks that at least some of its value comes from its portability, especially as “our lives are becoming more digitally based.” For others, the value is perhaps best described as intrinsic. “I think art is so personal. I know a lot of my collectors have said ‘this piece really speaks to me’ and that's why they bought it,” Max Osiris, the early adopter, said. See also: Michael Casey - NFTs Are Here. But Where Are They Headed?While we may bemoan the loss of experiencing art firsthand, the possibility of creating in a new medium allows for radically new approaches to production. “We like to encourage our artists to really embrace the media… Like, hey, go crazy, make some animated digital artworks, make some vector files, do something that you can't do in the physical media,” Duncan said. “I know that to stand out, I have to keep making art that is relevant yet interesting in its own ways,” Osiris said. “It’s the age of experimentation really. There's movements and there's individual artists, particular pieces that tend to define these eras.” Coldie agrees, and said crypto artists aren’t merely appending work to the blockchain, but telling the “culturally significant” story of blockchain as it develops. Even if an artist can’t pin down why something resonantes, the immediacy of tokenizing a work and having it available to a global audience is helping artists, like Owerko, refine their style for the digital age.“I have contemporaries whose art is only collected by incredibly wealthy people, like rappers and bankers, yet they’re followed and adored by people that can't afford their art,” Lyle Owerko said in a phone call. “There’s this chasm between collectors and their audience.” Being able to sell a $20 nifty helps Owerko close the gap and rediscover what his art actually means to people. That being said, not all in the crypto art world are supportive of Nifty’s project. “As far as we see [Nifty Gateway] doesn’t add too much innovation and takes a step in the wrong direction by using a centralized exchange as the core of its app,” said Nate Geier, CEO of Mintbase, another NFT platform. Geier said sites such as SuperRare and KnownOrigin paved the way for attracting non-crypto users to think about digital assets, and fully decentralized sites like CryptoVoxels and OpenSea provided a place for people to use, display, and exchange these assets in the interoperable landscape.""They never really walked me through what to expect. To be honest, I wish they gave me more advice about what I was doing and why I should care,"" Cey Adams, an artist on Nifty Gateway, said of the Cock Fosters. ""It would be nice if I could log in one day and see how this works and if I made money and if I can transfer it. But no one has done or said anything. It makes me wonder,"" he said, taking a beat. ""It doesn't feel real.""“In collectibles, we sell dreams, stories and wonders,” Rinker said. “Believe whatever story you’re told and hope to God it’s true.” The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The network conducted a $145 million token sale in 2017 and launched its canary network Kusama in July 2019. Since then, Polkadot has focused on integrations with other networks such as Chainlink and Polymath.Read more: Web3’s Gavin Wood Launches Kusama Network to Test Polkadot ProtocolLike Kusama, Wood told RL1 attendees Polkadot will roll out in five or six stages, beginning with a “chain candidate” launched by the Web3 Foundation. The candidate operates as a de facto genesis block for the network, but under the guidance of Web3 Foundation developers. If the candidate does not meet the team’s requirements during this initial phase, it will be replaced by another, Wood said.Notably, the network will launch under a Proof-of-Authority (PoA) consensus algorithm that Wood invented, which will initially give all on-chain authority to the Web3 Foundation, the non-profit behind Polkadot. As such, the Polkadot network will have limited functionality, Wood said.“It allows us to start the chain without having to have a set of validators already assembled and having to trust in our potentially unfulfilled governance structures to move the chain forward,Wood said.The PoA structure is not dissimilar to the NEAR protocol, another Ethereum competitor that announced the launch of its mainnet earlier this week. NEAR is likewise rolling out in a heavily restricted form.Read more: NEAR Protocol Launches Following $21M Token Sale Led by Andreessen HorowitzSubsequent stages of the Polkadot rollout will issue the network’s DOT tokens to holders and form validators for the planned switch to PoS. This work will be overseen by a “Sudo module,” Wood said, that will govern how the blockchain structure is initially formed. This module will eventually be dissolved, with DOT token holders taking over the network’s governance toward the end of Polkadot’s launch.The Sudo module and overarching rollout structure are a “staging ground as much as a proposal” for evolving the chain from something that is restricted to something that is permissionless, Wood said.

The opinions expressed here belong solely to the author. ","Telegram runs the world’s largest independent messenger not controlled by a tech giant like Tencent or Facebook, both distrusted by users on privacy grounds. Populations of large countries such as Iran and Russia rely on it for uncensored communication. Civic activists from Hong Kong to Catalonia coordinate massive protests with Telegram. And, the global crypto community makes a modest contribution to its 400 million active users. In other words, this company and its future is important for the free world. Yet, this future is in jeopardy. Telegram fought off pressures from nation states and behemoth competitors to support its users’ freedom but lost a legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission this March. It was a preliminary court decision – but there’s much at stake. See also: Telegram Caves to US Regulators: Delays Blockchain Launch, Offers to Return $1.2B to InvestorsSome backstory: In early 2018, Telegram, seeking financing, conducted a private sale of its yet-to-be-created cryptocurrency in exchange for $1.7 billion from Silicon Valley’s top venture funds, big private investors and a few then-lucky others to fill the gap between those groups. The company’s fate is now to be decided by those stakeholders. After April 30, they can exercise their contractual right for a refund. Should this happen, the company would be drained of the money it needs not only to continue the legal dispute with the SEC, but maintain the infrastructure and development of its messenger (yearly burn rate is estimated at $200 million by founder Pavel Durov). Telegram would have to return investors around $1.2 billion they expected to have left from the fundraiser by now.This week, the company offered investors a proposal to extend the deadline for another year (in addition to the six months investors gave it back in October 2019 when the dispute erupted). Telegram wants to use this year to resolve its legal troubles and launch the blockchain. In return, it offered investors a token on the original terms or in the form of ""another cryptocurrency."" As a fallback option, Telegram promises 10% on top of the full investment amount (instead of just 72 cents on the dollar refunded now) to be paid from selling the stake in the company to a party external to the discussed transaction. So the company expects to spend $1.87 billion (excluding the runway and legal costs it will incur in the process) it doesn’t yet have if it loses its own bet to resolve legal troubles with the SEC in one year. Telegram hopes to turn almost free capital from 2018 into cheap capital in 2020, while risking to it becoming very expensive come 2021.Investors are offered a choice: to get back their 72 cents on a dollar now versus receiving some cryptocurrency, or a dollar and 10 cents in a year from now. Their opportunity cost is uncertain given the economic crisis we’re currently in. But some would argue it’s pretty high. Telegram hopes to turn almost free capital from 2018 into cheap capital in 2020, while risking to it becoming very expensive come 2021.Top litigators point out the preliminary injunction against Telegram granted to the SEC in March is ambiguous. Some also insist the future of compliant token fundraising and overall crypto innovation is also jeopardized here. Other legal experts believe the order to halt TON could be overthrown on appeal, or if the case ever reaches actual trial. Yet, some non-legal experts argue that, from a business standpoint, justice has been served. For now, though, what matters is what Telegram’s investors think. As a company (HASH CIB) counting some of the larger (non-U.S.) investors in TON (the Telegram Open Network) among our clients, we closely followed the project from its inception. My research team has produced lengthy coverage reports on TON, investor notes and updates. See also: Josh Lawler - Telegram Ruling Closes Another Door to Legally Compliant Token SalesOur readership, unfortunately restricted only to industry professionals and accredited investors, know we’ve long called their attention to the project’s execution risks, including issues related to U.S. securities laws. But in all honesty, we did not expect these issues to materialize the way they did.Telegram used the late peak of the 2017 initial coin offering wave to finance its messenger for years ahead, without having to give up control of the company. Getting a shot at creating a public blockchain to compete with Bitcoin and Ethereum was a secondary goal, yet very attainable. Building a blockchain didn’t seem that difficult given the open source nature of the industry, and the network effects were all on Telegram’s side. No public blockchain came even relatively close in the size of Telegram’s user base, while being able to reach market capitalizations of tens of billions of dollars at the same time. See also: Preston Byrne - With Kik and Telegram Cases, the SEC Tries to Kill the SAFTGiven the team’s track record in shipping great products and its ever-expanding user base, investors down-weighted issues related to complexity of their technological goals and inexperience with blockchains. At the time Telegram was aiming at high-calibre venture funds and family offices, turning down specialist crypto investors. Had some of those investors been given allocations, Telegram might have received more support from top crypto insiders, who are often consulted by U.S. regulators.Telegram’s troubles started not really with the manner in which it sold its future tokens. Most of the projects at the time used similar rhetoric and tactics, including large ones, later let off the hook by the SEC or investors. What mainly prompted TON’s problems was that Telegram was too ambitious in its technological aspirations and didn’t care to harness a developer and user community around their ambitions. Legal concerns could explain why the company did very little to engage with future users of its cryptocurrency (and this could be addressed after launch, given the messenger’s popularity). But its in-transparency didn’t help. The team stuck to an internal team of “star programmers,” first-time blockchain devs and leveraged little external help and subsequent open-source peer-reviewing and testing – an uncommon practice for such a massive endeavor. That cost them  development time before the SEC got involved. Telegram was too ambitious in its technological aspirations and didn’t care to harness a developer and user community around their ambitions.Telegram hasn’t engaged much with its own investors either. Investors were continuously unclear as to when TON would launch or what services it would eventually provide. The company seemed to believe that users, developers and investors would continue supporting it regardless. Maybe that explains why investors didn’t come out after the March court decision to help the company turn things around and negotiate restructuring prior to the April 30 deadline. Will they be willing to take the equity offer if Telegram doesn’t find a suitable buyer a year from now?With all that in mind, going back to the recent offer Telegram made to its investors, the following questions arise:Would the company be able now to retain funds sufficient to fight the SEC, maintain its ever-growing messenger, continue developing the blockchain and potentially fight additional legal claims from some of its investors? The significant portion of the remaining $1.2 billion would need to be retained to make it happen.If it indeed does, would it be able to win the litigation in a year’s time and launch TON as initially envisioned, or if it loses, find a buyer for its equity, willing to pay for the aftermath?What if it doesn’t retain the funds necessary, not even the $200 million to $300 million to both focus just on the messenger and fight off potential other complaints?Answers to these questions aren’t unknown. There is much corporate history to back them up. I believe investors are finally getting a chance to get a piece of the company come April 2021. And that’s what some of them wanted when participating in its crypto sale: exposure to Telegram’s growth and success. This is less relevant for the crypto industry, though, which I hope stays unaffected. More than that, I also hope the outcome of this doesn’t affect Telegram 400 million loyal users. But of that I am less certain.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The firm thinks the incubator can help further develop its own two-layer blockchain platform, too.CK Labs comes a few months after the open source network pledged to award $30 million in grants to development teams that help Nervos improve its layer one infrastructure. “There are still many more infrastructure improvements to come, but the launch of CK Labs marks the next phase of Nervos as we start expanding the network’s utility with dapps and Layer 2 solutions,” Kevin Wang, co-founder of Nervos, told CoinDesk. The firm will initially allocate $5 million to help the startups bring their products to market while providing them with access to major crypto venture capital firms including Polychain Capital, Multicoin Capital, Dragonfly Capital and 1confirmation.According to Nervos, any startup with an existing minimum viable product could apply for, and potentially receive, up to $100,000 in equity-free capital plus join a four-month program designed to help the teams get a deeper understanding of the Nervos’ infrastructure and the resources needed to launch or scale products on the network. Founded in 2018, the San Francisco-based Nervos has raised over $100 million. It secured a $28 million Series A funding led by Polychain and Sequoia China in July 2018 and a $72 million token sale in November. Its two-layer open network aims to maintain as high a level of security as the Bitcoin network, while increasing scalability through a side chain. CK Labs will be headed by Ben Morris. Morris comes from Status, an Ethereum-based messaging platform where he headed its incubator program. He led investments into Matrix, Pixura and LeapDAO, three startups focused on improving the scalability of Ethereum-based networks.Before that Morris worked as Head of Treasury Specialists at Thomson Reuters out of Dubai and was eCommerce business development manager at Bloomberg from Singapore.“The CK Labs program was specifically designed to accelerate teams focused on ushering in the first wave of adoption,” Morris said. “Given the versatility of Nervos, we want to invite founders from all business verticals to apply.”The firm said applications for the first batch of CK Labs are now being accepted. The program will run several times every year with two to four teams each to ensure they get personalized support.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

She's now a member of the Official Committee of Affected Users and the Bankruptcy Board of Inspectors. QuadrigaCX is one of the stories in crypto that'll end up getting made into a movie. There are so many twists and turns, and mystery remains after the exchange's CEO, Gerald Cotten, unexpectedly died (although some believe he faked his death) on a trip to India in late 2018. He was supposedly the only person who held the keys to some C$250 million (US$190 million) in user funds – a pile of money that has been in dispute ever since. But once Canadian authorities started their  investigation, it became clear Cotten also mismanaged client funds in many, many ways. It's been a little over a year since Cotten's death was reported, setting off  a whirlwind investigation. Gronowska gives insight into where the case stands today.  Topics include: Next up: Sign up to join the next CoinDesk Live on Tuesday, April 28 with Carlos Acevedo, founder of the Crypto Community Project, which is dedicated to educating low-income communities on crypto and blockchain.Acevedo is also the director of sales and the regional lead for Latin America at Brave. And then, of course, join us at Consensus: Distributed May 11-15 where Acevedo will be speaking.

A philosopher of the web and all-around radical open-internet advocate, Halpin is the CEO of Nym, a privacy-tech startup. Here he talks to privacy reporter Benjamin Powers about what he's doing to see out the virus and why ""holistic privacy"" matters more than ever at a time like this.","Powers: How are you holding up?Halpin: I first heard about coronavirus, not surprisingly, through crypto Twitter. At first I panicked and went out and bought about a month's supply of food and basically started preparing for lockdown, which then did indeed happen. It was the first time crypto Twitter seems to have been correct. I would never trust crypto Twitter when it comes to cryptocurrency, but it was completely correct on the coronavirus. In my personal life it's not a huge change. The main difference is I no longer travel. Our team is spread out among Belgium, London and other places but now our team is just fully remote. On some level I've enjoyed not traveling because I can get more work done. See also: Cypherpunk Harry Halpin Takes On DavosSo I just wake, do some stretching and I’ve ordered weights and a punching bag. And so I just wake up, I go running, I stretch, and then will do some weightlifting and boxing. The main issue to some extent is lack of downtime. Because there's no events or socializing outside of me and my girlfriend basically. So far we’ve not killed each other, so it's been fine! BP: We’re all learning a lot about our relationships these days. HH: But when I call my friends and family in the United States I get very concerned. Most of my friends have lost jobs, and most people we know in the States had their health care attached to their job. They can't afford it otherwise. It’s interesting, too, because my younger friends, who are Zoomers or millennials, are taking this really seriously, while the [baby] boomers aren’t. It's really weird but it looks like the boomers are in a deathtrap.BP: And how is COVID-19 impacting your business?It was the first time crypto Twitter seems to have been correct. So we obviously can’t have regular in-person meetings. But when it comes to online meetings and chatting, we do that all the time anyway. So it’s been fine and makes you think that maybe we didn't need as many face to face meetings as I thought we did previously. We're making a lot of breakthroughs partially because it's easier to focus without a lot of meetings, events and conferences. That being said, we have had a lot of security concerns. We set up our own Jitsi server and we’re phasing out of Zoom. We’re keeping all internal communication encrypted. We are big fans of Signal and to a lesser extent Keybase. And from a bottom line business standpoint, it's been fine. In terms of funding we aren't a huge Filecoin-style project. We've never raised that much in f funds, but we've done conservative management of the funds we have, so we have a year's runway or so. Therefore, we're not particularly concerned about running out of money and, to some extent, we've noticed that cutting travel has saved a lot of money. That being said, we did have to phase back and remove a few contractors and cut non-essential expenses. From the business standpoint the question is, how long is coronavirus going to last? Should we keep our office leases? Those are pretty large sunk costs. We're also, as a blockchain business, not sure if we even qualify for these government loans and emergency funding.See also: Preston Byrne: How to Escape Contracts That Are Killing Your Company During CoronavirusIf you're a firm with a year's worth of runaway in the bank, it’s unlikely. And, looking at the fine print, it seems to say these loans are only for businesses that will have to lose employees. And that’s not really the case for us. We cut contractors and we cut one employee at the end of the month. The loans also aren’t all that big and, with the bureaucratic overhead, maybe a smarter decision for the business would be, or at least what I’m doing with some of my personal finances, is playing the long game on bitcoin. BP: You and I have spoken previously about contact tracing, which is something you have been looking at closely. Does it worry you?HH: When it comes to contact tracing, we see a lot of interest in blockchain, even if that’s not translated to financial support. We see people wanting to build on a mixnet, and researchers discussing the benefits of that. And we were talking with some governments, but that’s gone cold, and I’m worried governments are moving towards centralized, non-privacy enhanced solutions. So why would they fund research or deployment of a privacy enhanced solution? [A mix network, taking its name from the proxy servers it employs, called “mixes,” obscures the metadata left behind when data passes through a network.]We’re keeping all internal communication encrypted. BP: And so give us a little preview about what you’re going to be tackling and talking about at Consensus.HH: We're going to be looking at privacy, holistic privacy, and not just cryptocurrencies. So a lot of people believe rather mistakenly that if I send them monero transaction or Zcash transaction it’s fully secure and private, but that’s just not true. With Zcash not only do you have to be shielded but you have to descend to your network-level traffic (that's your IP address), which is broadcasting your bitcoin transaction or your Zcash transaction and every other transaction. So we're going to walk people through what we call a holistic approach to privacy, starting with a kind of interesting setup where we're going to try to get people to use a VPN. There's a very nice secure VPN run by the ex-Pirate Bay people that takes payment in cryptocurrency without your ID. I’m going to see if people could get that set up, then work with them on The Onion Router (TOR), particularly looking at Tails, which is the Linux bootable TOR CD that [whistleblower Edward] Snowden used, which is still up to date and very probably the best network-level security.But it's not clear how to integrate Tails very well with something like Zcash or monero desktop wallets. I've actually done it. It's very complicated. And then lastly, we're going to get people to try to spin up, or contribute to privacy, by running a TOR relay and mixnet, showing them how to set up their own VPN server. That would mean  they could go to, say, China and communicate back without too much of a problem. The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.
