Bitcoin buyers following the halving. 10540 Total views. 167 Total ...",,A majority of Chinese miners expect a huge influx of new Bitcoin (BTC) buyers within the next six months.,"According to a poll by crypto services firm RockX on May 4, 57% of Chinese miners expect a large number of new Bitcoin buyers to join the market in the near future.RockX claims to have polled 42 prominent Bitcoin miners and members of the Asian mining community. Respondents include F2Pool chief operating officer Yu Chao, TokenInsight partner Wayne Zhao, Pandaminer and OXBTC CEO Wilson Guo and Bitmain APAC head of sales Fan Xiaojun.Over 71% of the respondents also believed that the market has regained its confidence in Bitcoin. Furthermore, 45% of respondents believe that in the next six months, Bitcoin’s price will be between $10,000 and $12,000, nearly 24% think it will stay around $10,000 with low volatility and over 14% believe BTC will be worth over $15,000.Most (over 57%) of the respondents also believe that Bitcoin’s hashrate won’t change significantly after the halving, and expect it to be between 110 and 130 exahashes per day. According to Bitcoin network analytics website BitInfoCharts, as of today Bitcoin’s network currently has a hashrate of 127 exahashes per day.This seems to fall in line with what many in the crypto community are thinking. As Cointelegraph recently reported 37% of the cryptocurrency community expects Bitcoin’s hashrate to be higher one month after the block reward halving than it currently is.A majority of Chinese miners also expect Bitmain’s Antminer S9 to be still profitable after the halving. The Antminer is the first Bitcoin mining application-specific integrated circuit based on a 16-nanometer process chip, but is not the most efficient machine available.RockX CEO Alex Lam — who has reportedly managed mining firms since 2013 — told Cointelegraph that because of the wet season in China, domestic mining farms could take advantage of cheap hydropower and continue operating with older and less efficient machines.Still, Lam noted that mining farms based in the United States, Canada and Europe could phase out older machines after the halving, predicting that Bitcoin's hash rate will fall by about 30% a month after the event.Respondents also expect the U.S. economy to influence Bitcoin in the future; 64% of them expect the quantitative easing measures undertaken by the federal reserve to have a “somewhat positive effect” on Bitcoin. Only 12% of the respondents believe the measures will have a very positive impact, while another 12% think it will have no impact."

and Morocco has peaked over the past few weeks, marking new ...",,"The demand for cryptocurrency in certain countries is growing amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Bitcoin (BTC) peer-to-peer trading volume in Argentina, Chile, Venezuela and Morocco has peaked over the past few weeks, marking new all-time highs. ","Additional reports suggest that traffic on centralized cryptocurrency exchanges has also peaked within the past few weeks, while major trading platforms such as Kraken and Coinbase have commenced hiring sprees due to increased customer interest. So, why exactly are people trading more crypto during the global lockdown, and where is this trend most apparent?Like perhaps any other industry out there, the cryptocurrency market has been affected by the pandemic. However, the effects the virus has had on the sector are not entirely negative. While the price of Bitcoin plunged in March, it has since bounced back to its pre-crash levels. It is typical in a financial crisis to see some assets rise and fall during a short period of time, as Jeff Dorman, the chief investment officer of the crypto-oriented investment management firm Arca, told Cointelegraph:""During the first few weeks of a financial crisis, either liquidity or solvency-based, investors generally rush to sell everything they don't really believe in. The next few weeks are spent buying whatever you do believe in. The rest of the time is sitting around waiting for your decisions to pan out and for clarity to improve.""Further, the virus has somewhat paradoxically offered more opportunities for crypto companies such as the United States-based exchange Kraken, which has recently added an extra 100 job openings in the wake of apparently elevated customer interest. “The traditional system seems to be completely breaking down all over the world,” Jesse Powell, the co-founder and CEO of Kraken, explained: “Increased customer demand is going to mean increased business for us, and it's going to mean increased hiring.”San Francisco-headquartered Coinbase is also hiring dozens across its offices in the U.S., Europe and Asia. The company is apparently “full steam ahead,” executing on its 2020 strategy despite the looming economic crisis, as announced last month by the company’s CEO, Brian Armstrong. According to Armstrong, whose company reportedly saw as much as $1.3 billion in fiat and cryptocurrencies deposited into its wallets in just one day amid the March market crash, crypto might be the key component of a post-COVID-19 financial system.But it wasn’t just Coinbase that saw gigantic volumes come in on March 12, the day Bitcoin’s price fell by nearly 50% during the event that has since been dubbed “Black Thursday” by the community. During the peak hours of the sell-off, Bitfinex was handling up to $11.8 million worth of trades per minute, according to a press release the company sent to Cointelegraph. Kim Grauer, the head of research at the blockchain and crypto analytics firm Chainalysis, echoed the sentiment, telling Cointelegraph that “cryptocurrency exchanges experienced their largest ever Bitcoin inflows,” adding:“9x the daily average amount of Bitcoin was sent to exchanges to be sold from March 12 to March 13. This selling pressure led to a ~37% fall in price. Price pressures have since eased.”According to Chainalysis data provided to Cointelegraph, the total on-chain activity across all assets during the week of March 15 amounted to as much as $44 billion, although the volume has normalized during April. Exchange trading volumes reached a “several year high” during the initial sell-off as the collapse in prices spurred activity, John Todaro, the head of research at TradeBlock, confirmed in an email conversation with Cointelegraph:“This was seen throughout markets as U.S. investment bank trading desks saw some of the highest volumes in years. Since early March, exchange trading activity has fallen some as prices have stabilized.”Stablecoins represent a particularly popular kind of asset during these times, Todaro told Cointelegraph: “One area within digital currency markets that has seen growth in trading volumes are stablecoins, which likely were in high demand as they effectively offered USD-equivalent exposure.”“We have seen a move to stablecoins in the past month or two,” Grauer confirmed, elaborating that the U.S. dollar is still deemed more reliable than Bitcoin, despite all the recent criticism of Federal Reserve money printing:“We think that the stability of the USD is attractive and considered to be a more stable investment. If we do end up seeing a systematic move to Bitcoin during times of uncertainty, I think this would be further evidence that it is also considered a reliable store of value, or at least more reliable than available alternatives.”If anything, the U.S. dollar has become even more popular, Jack Purdy, an analyst at the crypto research firm Messari, told Cointelegraph: “The biggest trend has been dollarization that we've been seeing in traditional markets and has made its way into crypto.”But are people actually trading more crypto during the lockdown? It might be true in some countries such as Russia, where traffic on crypto exchanges reportedly surged 5.56% during the last week of March compared to February averages. Notably, the increased traffic numbers coincided with Russia’s first paid nonworking week, which was scheduled from March 28 through April 5 to mitigate the coronavirus outbreak. However, there seems to be no data for centralized crypto exchanges in other countries, which makes it practically impossible to confirm the trend. The above-mentioned data from Coinbase and other exchanges seems to indicate that people were actively trading because of the price drop on Black Thursday, not due to the coronavirus outbreak. The situation seems different in developing countries. Numbers obtained from LocalBitcoins, a popular peer-to-peer Bitcoin trading platform, seem to indicate that Bitcoin trade volume recently scored an all-time high in countries such as Argentina, Morocco and Venezuela.Specifically, LocalBitcoins volume in Chile reached a new record of over 330 million Chilean pesos during the week ending on April 4, while in Argentina the weekly volume of Bitcoin purchased with local currency has soared 1,028% since January 2018. Venezuela also just witnessed a new record, as Bitcoin weekly volume there constituted over 722 billion Venezuelan bolivars for the week ending April 25. It’s not just Latin America, however, as peer-to-peer Bitcoin trading in Morocco also reached a record-breaking volume at the start of April.All of those countries have one thing in common: unstable or challenged economies. Venezuela is mired in political and economic instability, with the country’s leader, Nicolas Maduro, apparently failing to launch a national cryptocurrency. Argentina faces a possible default on $65 billion in foreign debt, while Chile, despite being reportedly one of the richest countries in the South America region, is also seeing its economy being weakened by a lockdown enforced in the country. Finally, the Moroccan economy is expected to lose $2.89 billion in the first half of 2020 due to the pandemic. Todaro believes that people in some countries are turning to digital currencies for a good reason:“In countries with political instability, a global pandemic such as COVID-19 could have significant lasting effects. Perhaps it could spur changes in local and national governments.”Indeed, Bitcoin’s safe haven narrative has been performing best in countries such as Venezuela, where the local currency is inflating so fast that people are forced to spend their paychecks on the same day that they receive them — otherwise, they simply miss the opportunity to buy enough food. Bitcoin, on the other hand, proves to be a much more stable asset even despite its infamous volatility. Even if the price goes down, it is hardly going to be as dramatic as the 10,000,000% inflation rate that Venezuela had to endure last year.“In countries experiencing political instability (some in Latin America, Africa, and others) there seems to be a growing acceptance of Bitcoin and digital currencies more broadly,” Todaro told Cointelegraph. Grauer, however, is not yet drawing any concrete conclusions. According to her, the LocalBitcoins data might not be enough to prove a point:“There are certainly other interesting trends worth exploring in the Local Bitcoins trading data, but before we can draw conclusions as to whether people are systematically turning to crypto in times of uncertainty would require looking at all the data together first. We are working on our own analysis on this over the next couple of months.”It is indeed worth noting that LocalBitcoins data only shows volume for Bitcoin trade, while dollar-pegged stablecoins should be particularly valuable in developing economies, as noted above. On the other hand, it might be difficult to trade crypto online in countries such as Venezuela where local exchanges trading Bitcoin, Ether (ETH) and other popular cryptocurrencies and stablecoins are almost nonexistent.Related: Venezuela President Maduro Is Not Pro-Crypto, He Just Likes PetroEven regardless of the trade volume, crypto has remained popular as a concept during the COVID-19 outbreak, according to data provided by the analytics and finance management startup The Tie. “Since the beginning of the year Bitcoin’s 30 day average tweet volume has increased by 16.5%,” the firm’s CEO, Joshua Frank, told Cointelegraph. While the number of Bitcoin conversations on Twitter saw a decrease after Black Thursday, it has picked up pace due to the upcoming halving event, according to Frank. As a result, “Bitcoin sentiment is actually approaching the highest level we have seen in 2020.”"
2,https://cointelegraph.com,,US Bitcoin Holders Worry About Chinese Control of the Mining Network,https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-bitcoin-holders-worry-about-chinese-control-of-the-mining-network,"China has consolidated more than half of the world's Bitcoin mining 
operations. What threats could the situation create? 21219 Total views.",,"Could China take over the Bitcoin (BTC) ecosystem? It’s a very real possibility, and it could happen very quickly because China controls more than half of the world’s Bitcoin mining operations — upward of 65% of the computing power to mine Bitcoin. No other country is anywhere near that number. Additionally, according to Genesis Mining’s recent “The State of Crypto Mining 2020” report, 60% of Bitcoin owners have a real concern about that Chinese majority and what it could mean for the stabilization of the cryptocurrency.","And they should be worried. China owning more than half of mining operations could result in a disruption to the system, instability to the Bitcoin blockchain or even a takeover of the entire system. Bitcoin was not built to be a controlled currency.So, why is China’s vast mining network a concern? In order to understand the potential threat in China’s majority control, we need to look at a fundamental attribute of how the Bitcoin ecosystem works: decentralization.The founder of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, had a vision for a currency that wouldn’t be subject to a third party such as a bank, but that could be democratically exchanged from individual to individual. The Bitcoin ecosystem works because of the community behind it: the miners who add blocks to the chain and the nodes that scan transactions to make sure they adhere to the Bitcoin protocol. There’s no one entity that governs Bitcoin — and that’s the point.Even though Bitcoin has a strongly decentralized network, it could still be threatened. If someone were to control over 50% of the power used in mining operations, they could possibly disrupt the entire system through what’s called a 51% attack, or majority attack. A majority control would allow the attacker to alter transactions, double spend Bitcoin for their own gain or even block other miners from mining.Which is why it’s concerning that Chinese mines are running 65% of the global hashing power used to mine Bitcoin. It’s certainly more than 51%.It takes a lot of energy to mine Bitcoin, so it would make sense that miners would set up their rigs in places where energy and labor costs are cheap. Because China is a center of international trade, lead times and production costs for almost all goods are lower than in other countries, and this also holds true for mining farms and miners. But while a number of mining farms do run on sustainable resources such as hydroelectric power, many rely on coal to fuel their mining. While coal may be cheaper than other fuels such as gas and oil, it’s still more expensive than alternative options such as hydroelectric and wind power, and it’s unsustainable and detrimental to the environment.Having 65% of the world’s mining located in China is a concern. Even though Chinese mines work independently, the majority of the power is now located in one country. And the fact that the Chinese government has control over all of its industries is also a concern. If the government decides that it wants to take over the Bitcoin ecosystem, it could leverage its power over the country’s mining companies and simply take over a majority of the computing power, executing a 51% attack. Suddenly, the decentralized system would be centralized under one country.While this could be a very real scenario if all the right pieces fell into place, it’s probably a long shot. New players in the mining market are increasingly setting up shop in the European Nordic states, Canada and the United States. The running costs there, which include cheaper energy options such as hydroelectric and wind power, along with a lack of government oversight that would let companies plan their strategies freely make those locations attractive for investors looking for a more sustainable opportunity.Additionally, it’s unclear what China’s future will be with Bitcoin. It, along with all cryptocurrency, has been banned in the country for years. Though mining had been allowed to continue, the industry as a whole was on the chopping block last year. Even though the Chinese government suddenly announced at the end of 2019 a commitment to developing blockchain technology and allowed mines to continue to operate, the government still hasn’t reversed its ban on cryptocurrency. Even though China could take over Bitcoin, it just might not want to.Still, China’s overwhelming number of miners, mining pools and companies is something the Bitcoin community needs to be aware of. At the same time, the community can ensure that decentralization continues within the ecosystem by making sure it’s keeping its own mining operations diversified. As I mentioned above, we’re seeing new mining farms cropping up in new geographies, which will continue to distribute resources and mining power across the globe.It’s yet to be seen what the future of Chinese mining will be. But the Bitcoin community, which values transparency and democracy, will work to ensure that it remains open and available to all.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.Philip Salter is the head of mining operations at Genesis Mining, the world’s largest cloud crypto mining operation, where he leads the software development, data engineering and research teams.

A break above the $9,400 level would position Bitcoin price for a run at $9,600 and some analysts have called for a rally to $10,000. Although the halving is fast approaching and retail investors are feeling increasingly bullish, one must remember that since crashing to $3,750 on March 13, Bitcoin price has increased by more than 145% and the current set up on the daily time frame is beginning to look toppy. Furthermore, taking a birds-eye view of the daily or weekly chart, one will notice that $9,500 is a crucial level of resistance and support. Overcoming this level is expected to be a challenge but given Bitcoin’s proximity to the price, a high volume surge could knock it out.BTC USDT daily chart.

Source: CME Group.comLast Friday’s CME Bitcoin Futures Commitment of Traders (COT) report also shows that institutional investors have increased their short positions. As mentioned in previous analysis, Bitcoin is known to rally higher in situations where investor sentiment is strongly bullish, meaning the current overbought RSI, weak buy volume and generally overextended rally can all be irrelevant if FOMO is destined to kick in. But FOMO aside, a rejection at $9,400-$9,500 should result in the price pulling back to the $8,825-$8,550 where there is a high volume VPVR node. Below the $8,550 support traders will look for entries around $8,400 and $7,800. BTC USDT 4-hour chart.

Technically known as the “block subsidy halving,” the event will drop the supply of “new” Bitcoins paid to miners by 50% to 6.25 BTC per block.This immediate 50% drop in supply should have considerable knock-on effects for demand, especially taken against the historical precedent of the previous two halvings.The impact is neatly summarized by Bitcoin’s stock-to-flow price model, which suggests that major price movements should come 1-2 years after the halving.Cointelegraph has reported extensively on stock-to-flow’s various iterations and their forecasts.Bitcoin stock-to-flow model as of May 4.

Cointelegraph considers the major factors which traders should keep an eye on to avoid a nasty surprise.Stocks continue to move higher, and Bitcoin continues to move in line with stock market sentiment.While reducing its correlation in recent weeks, Bitcoin still remains sensitive to major moves on Wall Street. This week, prices there continue to trend upwards, but all is not what it seems, analysts warn. “Sharp declines in market breadth in the past have often signaled large market drawdowns,” Bloomberg quoted strategists at Goldman Sachs as saying on April 27. Narrow breadth can last for extended periods, but past episodes have signaled below-average market returns and eventual momentum reversals.Bitcoin versus S&P 500 3-month chart. Source: SkewThe warning that current swift gains could turn to losses capitalizes on existing concerns about the paradoxical status quo on markets. Despite millions of newly unemployed, small business implosions and trillions of dollars of money printing, stocks keep improving.Oil is steaming ahead with its protracted sell-off. In Asian morning trading on Monday, WTI plunged by almost 10%, while Brent slumped 3.2% to near $20 a barrel.No respite seems in sight for a market hammered by unprecedented negative prices last week — demand is unlikely to pick up for several months, while storage facilities have all but run out.A previous effort by OPEC+ countries to cut production was not enough, commentators have said. Bitcoin is overall impacted less by oil’s issues than those of other markets.Central banks continue to pump more worthless cash into the stricken and increasingly “neo-feudal” economy.On Monday, it was the Bank of Japan’s turn to announce a flood of paper, signaling it would buy unlimited bonds in order to incentivize borrowing. Questions remain over whether the United States Federal Reserve and European Central Bank will follow suit, the former having already inflated its balance sheet to a record $6.6 trillion.For Bitcoin network participants, meanwhile, the picture is increasingly — and verifiably — positive.Hash rate has recovered well since it dipped following the March price crash, consolidating at around 115 quintillion hashes per second (h/s). According to estimates from Blockchain, this is just 7 quintillion h/s below all-time highs seen earlier last month.Mining difficulty is also set for a healthy uptick of 3.2% at the next adjustment in around eight days’ time. This follows a larger 8.5% boost that Cointelegraph reported on previously.Overall implied volatility, monitoring resource Skew notes, is now also almost back at early March levels.It is now just over two weeks until the third Bitcoin block reward halving. At that point, Bitcoin’s block subsidy will drop from 12.5 BTC to 6.25 BTC per block.This reduces miner income significantly, while also drives up Bitcoin’s stock-to-flow ratio, as there will be fewer “new” Bitcoins created relative to the existing supply. Some analysts have become worried that the drop in revenue will spark problems for miners, but the creator of the seminal stock-to-flow price model for Bitcoin now believes otherwise.“2012&2016 halving data shows that difficulty will NOT adjust downward, but will keep rising post halving,” a tweet from PlanB on Friday reads.Miners have ALREADY invested in new hw and are prepared for -50% revenue."
6,https://cointelegraph.com,,"Bitcoin: Not a Safe Haven, but Maybe Something More",https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-not-a-safe-haven-but-maybe-something-more,"The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed Bitcoin's most important value, and it's 
not the price — but its decentralized nature. 28898 Total views.",,"Born within a financial meltdown and crisis, Bitcoin (BTC) has found itself again in the role of a proto-savior for the current failings of fiat and national currencies. Those failings namely being that national fiat currencies continue to be printed at a whim when political leaders are caught in a catch-22 between mass poverty and mass currency inflation — with any result likely being a compromised and unsatisfying mélange of stagflation.","Nevertheless, Bitcoin still isn’t immune from the pressures of a world steered toward uncharted waters. While one might respect the philosophical rigor of Bitcoin, it goes without saying that it is as vulnerable as any other asset in a panic-driven liquidity crunch. In a global economy where supply chain pressures have somehow made toilet paper the most valuable currency of all, Bitcoin could very easily be starting to lose the narrative that it is a store of value equivalent to digital gold. The fact that Bitcoin was an early asset sold off, initially outpacing the crash in traditional markets, shows it is not so much a store of value as a speculative asset, at least at this moment in history.For five days in March, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average ultimately shed what would be one-third of its value, Bitcoin felt the hurt of a panic-driven liquidity crunch, likely driven by institutional investors pulling out, and losing over half its value — from $9,100 to $4,100. Bitcoin was the first asset that people sold when they needed cash. You certainly don’t want to be waiting on a long transaction time when everyone is panic-buying toilet tissue and nature calls.Bitcoin still hasn’t lost nearly as much as it did when the bubble of its $20,000 peak burst at the end of 2017, shedding an even more jaw-dropping two-thirds in value. Putting aside the fact Bitcoin lost more in total value, perhaps inflated by speculative froth, that “crash” was also more destructive to Bitcoin’s progress because it was endemic to Bitcoin and its raft of new speculators.Additionally, after the panic drop of early March 2020, Bitcoin’s price has stabilized in the $6,000–$7,000 range for the last month. In markets where the ultimate bottoms remain a mystery, a plateau for any significant amount of time is still something of a moral victory. Obviously, the best-case scenario would be for Bitcoin to bounce back to pre-crash prices, but this is unlikely and delusional to think, especially as the entire world’s markets remain down.Here’s the bigger picture bad news for Bitcoin: There is no way, as things currently stand, that we can argue that Bitcoin is in any way a practical safe haven.This brings further questions about what Bitcoin actually is right now. It’s not a payment token, and it’s not a store of value — so what is it? For now, it’s an outdated piece of technology that’s more brand than an actual use case. The idea that the crypto market is separate from traditional markets was proven to be wrong during the crash. They are much more closely linked than anyone thought.However, as we know, this is not a position unfamiliar to Bitcoin. While its value is now very uncertain, and it could very easily go lower and lower because we simply don’t know how the world will be transformed by an unprecedented public health crisis. Along with business slowdowns and shutdowns for several months, there also still lies great promise in Bitcoin as a new economic solution, if not necessarily as an (especially speculative) investment vehicle.In a time when western leaders are alternately praising and condemning China’s initial handling of the pandemic, that well-worn but also well-proven Chinese trope might be more timely than ever: A crisis can also mean opportunity. And here’s the good news for Bitcoin: Maybe the coronavirus will finally end the speculative frenzy that has defined and overshadowed the actual technology for the last half-decade.The greed of short-term gain has driven long-term pain in innovation. Why innovate when there’s more profit in predicting the market? In a time of severe short-term pain, perhaps this will open the door to long-term gain. Just because Bitcoin is not a practical safe haven for a world in crisis facing severe short-term strains on the economy and supply chain, that does not mean Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will not provide some of the best solutions to drive a new economy.In a new era when we have become newly aware of the invisible lethality that lurks in the otherwise unassuming paper note, number pad or touchscreen, electronic finance of all kinds will serve a newly vital purpose. In the long term, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies may not see value as either a safe haven or a get-rich-quick scheme but rather as one of the best means of transmitting value in a world that will accelerate a transition to the digital formats that would have otherwise taken years or even decades.That doesn’t mean Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies still won’t attract investors who are looking for alternative assets, especially those unmoored from capricious governments. However, with a newfound important purpose, the actual utility of these cryptocurrencies stands to increase multiple times over. My advice?

The reporter said: “These four used methods of controlling the couple’s mobile phones, restricting their freedom, beating and threatening them and forcing the two to transfer all the 18.88 bitcoins and 6466 sky coins they own.” During the first court hearing, the group of four expressed their willingness to return the Bitcoin and Skycoin obtained from Pete and Xiaoli Wang. The court sentenced the robbers to between six months and fifteen days to eight months of imprisonment for the crime of illegal detention.The court also decided if the guilty parties were unable to return the same cryptocurrency, they should instead return local currency valued at the same price as BTC and Skycoin on June 12, 2018. However, the four refused to accept the decision. They appealed the ruling, saying that: “The current Chinese laws do not recognize the property attributes of Bitcoin and Skycoin, and do not regard Bitcoin and Skycoin as objects or property in the legal sense of China. Therefore, Pete and Wang Xiaoli do not have the right to request the return of property rights.”After almost 2 years of fighting in court, the couple eventually gave up on getting their Skycoin back. They continued to insist, however, that the court order the return of their Bitcoin. The court did eventually order the four robbers to return the couple’s 18.88 BTC. As Cointelegraph reported previously, similar disputes have occurred in China in the past. The Chinese court in Hangzhou made the same decision, recognizing Bitcoin as virtual property."

On March 12, the price dropped to as low as $3,600 and many whales did not move their funds at the time.What the data shows, however, is that many whales are comfortable holding onto BTC despite the risk of a significant correction to the $3,000 to $4,000 multi-year support area. This paints an optimistic long-term trend for the cryptocurrency market and the patience of high net worth investors.A major Bitcoin whale’s fund movement. Source: CoinMetricsSince 2015, the infrastructure supporting the cryptocurrency market has improved exponentially. A growing number of trusted custodians are opening, a larger variety of futures exchanges are available, and there are large-scale regional spot exchanges backed by stable banking services.Both retail and institutional investors are actively accumulating Bitcoin subsequent to intense corrections. An analytical report published by Coinbase found that after the drop to $3,750 in March, retail investors immediately bought the dip.Data from Grayscale’s Q1 2020 report also showed that a noticeable increase in demand for Bitcoin from institutional investors was observed.As more investors accumulate Bitcoin, the circulating supply of BTC decreases and this can weaken major downtrends in the market.Over time, it’s possible that corrective phases will become weaker and faster as Bitcoin approaches its fixed supply of 21 million.Furthermore, whales and other long-term holders may view Bitcoin as the best asset to hold over the long term due to the fact that lost funds are not recoverable, the coin supply is capped, and the halving decreases the rate at which new supply is introduced to the market.Researchers at CoinMetrics said:“A large Bitcoin whale just graduated to a 5yr HODLer. Last week 68k BTC moved out of the 5yr active supply band, indicating that the last time they moved on-chain was in April 2015.”Even with the halving just 13 days away, there still exists a possibility that BTC sees a severe pullback regardless of the reluctance of whales to sell their holdings. But, the optimistic stance of whales decreases the probability of a capitulation-like fall in the near-term.Merely 24 hours after Bitcoin’s fall to $3,600, it rebounded to above $4,000, and eventually made its way back to $7,000 within a span of a month.As previously reported by Cointelegraph, the sharp drop from $8,000 to $3,600 occured due to a cascade of liquidations across futures exchanges, primarily BitMEX. Thus, it was overleveraged traders being liquidated that triggered the drop, not a sell-off from spot-trading whales.The movement of HODLers adds validity to the theory that BTC should have never dropped below $5,000 in the first place and investors who bought the dip to the $3,000 to $4,000 range are unlikely to sell anytime soon."

There are limited options to hedge in an environment characterized by uncertainty.Its title is another term coined to describe the effect of Bitcoin’s upcoming block reward halving in around two weeks. Whereas central banks are engaging in now unlimited quantitative easing, or QE, Bitcoin’s supply is cutting in half. Other sources call this juxtaposition “quantitative hardening,” referring to Bitcoin’s status as “hard” money versus fiat as “easy money.”“Bitcoin is showing signs of becoming a safe haven while maintaining an asymmetric return profile,” Grayscale’s conclusion summarizes. And while the world is seemingly challenging every notion of what is possible, it’s time to challenge another one — that fiat currencies will retain their value. It’s time to pay attention to Bitcoin.As Cointelegraph reported, Grayscale has fared well despite the huge panic caused by coronavirus in March. The company now has $3 billion in assets under management, while earlier this month, it emerged that it now controls 1.7% of the entire Bitcoin supply.The report barely holds back in its thinly-veiled criticism of central bank policy. Investors, it says, should “understand the effects of government monetary and fiscal intervention.”That language echoes some of Bitcoin’s best-known supporters, including Saifedean Ammous, who extensively addresses fiat weakness in his popular book, “The Bitcoin Standard.” Speaking on the latest episode of financial news show the Keiser Report, meanwhile, Max Keiser reiterated that as a society, “you can’t print your way to prosperity.”"

This integration makes it possible for billions of dollars in fresh liquidity to make its way to EOS-based decentralized finance.”Thomas Bertani, founder of the development team behind pTokens, Provable Things, emphasized that the integration unites the world’s reserve currency, the United States dollar, with the biggest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin:“With Bitcoin now providing additional collateral for EOSDT, we unite the world’s traditional reserve currency, the U.S. dollar, with the most used and popularised digital asset to date. This marriage between fiat and digital currencies creates layers of liquidity and a unique collateral base that traditional currencies simply cannot provide.”Equilibrium says that EOSDT smart contracts hold more than $10 million EOS collateral. This is claimed to be the biggest amount among all EOS-based decentralized applications so far. The annual percentage rate of EOSDT-driven liquidity against collateral of volatile crypto assets accounts for 1%, Melikhov told Cointelegraph.As of press time, the latest $100 million increase in EOSDT supply cap can be tracked via EOS block explorer Block.io.The news comes amid the upcoming pBTC listing on major crypto exchange, Bitfinex.

According to Investopedia, Elliott Wave Theory is a method of technical analysis that identifies impulsive and corrective movements based on three-wave and five-wave patterns. Impulsive waves are in line with the trend, while corrective waves are against the trend. Rastani uses this methodology to describe Bitcoin’s current rally.“...from an Elliott Wave perspective, this rally to me is not corrective. To me, it's actually impulsive. So we've got five waves already in this rally. This five wave rally tells me that we're in the beginning of a major - this to me is wave one of a longer term bull market in Bitcoin.”Turpin, on the other hand, approaches the Bitcoin market from a more macro-oriented perspective. He sees Bitcoin’s success as a function of its correlation with the stock market and as its role as an alternative asset.“I'd like to believe that the correlation from here would be much less from here and actually just push Bitcoin further, justifying actually the fact that if, you know, states get more and more debt and then, you know, the fiat currencies get depreciated over time, then actually there will be more and more interest for alternative assets.”Make sure to watch the full video for a more detailed look at Rastani and Turpin’s price targets.Bitcoin may dominate the cryptocurrency market capitalization, but altcoins should never be forgotten. In this video, our guests give their opinions on six of the top altcoins.Turpin first explains why he’s keeping a close eye on Ethereum and EOS.“So Ethereum as an infrastructure play, I think it's gone back and out of favor here and there. I quite like - for a long time I quite like EOS, not necessarily always in terms of the project, the quality of the project, but it's because they've done, you know, good and bad things with their money.

He expressed his amusement over the constant requests for his views of Chainlink.“The first one I want to show you guys is Chainlink. I mention Chainlink because every time I talk about cryptos on my channel, on my YouTube channel, people always say, ""talk about Chainlink."" So I get a lot of comments about this all the time.

The coming months will show how institutional investors will react in the medium term to the countless rescue packages in the wake of the coronavirus crisis. One thing is certain: States and central banks have been hard-pressed for solutions. Moreover, it looks like their efforts have been exhausted already at the start. Should investors end up losing faith in the measures taken, the consequences would be far more dramatic than a short-term stock market crash.","No one can foresee today what our future monetary system will look like, but the history of money has been marked sometimes by radical system changes. Today’s historical interventions in the free market are unparalleled, especially given their magnitude, and will no doubt in hindsight be seen as the beginning of the end of our current monetary system with its fiat currencies “made out of nothing.”Is Bitcoin (BTC) “digital gold” and a “safe haven” currency? Yes, now more than ever before.Bitcoin was created in 2008 in response to the financial crisis­, and the present-day chaos on the global financial markets is the first major test of its ability to assert itself as an alternative and a new asset class. However, when liquidity is needed, as it is now, everything is sold, especially risky assets. John Bollinger, the creator of the so-called Bollinger Band, a technical indicator for price developments, rightly noted that in times of crisis, investors will “sell whatever they can sell,” and only after assets have been turned into cash is an investment made in crisis-proof assets — e.g., gold.In contrast to state-run monetary watchdogs who have been trying to safeguard “a continuously functioning market” by pumping in “avalanches” of money (and not just since the coronavirus outbreak), the pricing of Bitcoin is regulated without any intermediary interference and is solely based on supply and demand. There is also a cap to the number of Bitcoins that can be created — 21 million — and this means that in contrast to traditional fiat currency, no new Bitcoins can be arbitrarily printed. New Bitcoins are “mined” in the same way that other commodities are — e.g., gold — but through a complex and clearly defined process. No one is able to alter the number of newly generated Bitcoins.It will be a clear advantage for our traditional monetary system to have alternatives to fall back on in the likely event of hyperinflation. “Creative instruments,” such as helicopter money and similar interventionist measures, are not possible in the same way with Bitcoin, and neither governments, (central) banks nor other institutions are able to manipulate and/or change the parameters of this new decentralized asset class. Since the hegemonic power of the United States has been also weakening, the topic of reserve currency will at some point be on the table. Already today, it is foreseeable that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will compete with digital currencies issued by state governments. Is Bitcoin a “global digital currency?” This might sound like science fiction, but it is actually not that unfounded.Meanwhile, institutional investors have started to see the attraction of crypto assets. However, in times of crisis, they are often quick to withdraw their capital from risky investments, and Bitcoin is still classified as such by the majority.Personally, I am convinced that Bitcoin, as well as other digital assets, can only benefit from the current developments and their dramatic long-term consequences.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.This article was first published in German by the Swiss monthly magazine Schweizer MonatMarc P.

The resistance is found at the $7,700-7,800 area, while the support is found between $7,275 and $7,350.

Next, further upwards momentum is likely to occur towards $92-94 billion. However, losing the green levels and tests at $66 and $57.5 billion should be expected.BTC USD bullish scenario 4-hour chart. Source: TradingViewEither way, both scenarios are quite simple, given that Bitcoin broke out of a sideways range. As long as the green levels around $7,300 hold as support, further upwards momentum is in play.Moreover, the halving narrative is also becoming increasingly important. Such a narrative could create FOMO (fear of missing out) and generate some more buying pressure leading up to the event. Be aware, however, as such events typically end up in “buy the rumor, sell the news” fashion. In other words, a substantial rally going into the event with a selloff after the event should not be unexpected.In any case, holding $7,300 as support strengthens the bullish case. The price of Bitcoin could be hovering around this range for a while before attacking either of the levels. A breakthrough of the $7,700 area would likely warrant further upwards momentum with targets of $8,500 and $9,000 (as that’s also the CME gap).BTC USD bearish scenario 4-hour chart. Source: TradingViewThe bearish scenario is also straightforward. If the price of Bitcoin starts to rally towards the resistance but then sees a selloff afterward, a temporary top is likely to be in. Particularly, since the $7,700 area was the last level of defense before the Black Thursday BTC price crash. If that level can’t be reclaimed as support, lower levels must then be retested before the market can regroup for any further upward moves.Thus, a selloff resulting in a  retest of $7,250 and immediate rejection of $7,400 would be a signal for further downwards momentum with the next targets at $6,800 and $6,500. The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

Source: SkewThe Bitcoin price saw a vertical rally to $9,500 in a short period of time. It took less than two months for BTC to rise by nearly three-fold from $3,600.Much of the positive sentiment around the upsurge of Bitcoin in April was attributed to the dominance of organic spot volume. It suggested that from $3,600 to mid-$7,000, retail investors accumulated BTC.In previous rallies, spoof orders coming from the futures market created speculative short-term bubbles that burst as soon as a large whale triggered a cascading sell-off.While high spot volume from exchanges like Coinbase can be considered an optimistic piece of data, it cannot solely justify the sustainability of such a large rally within a two-month span. The same way Buffett is struggling to find value in the stock market to lead major acquisition deals.Speaking at the annual Berkshire Hathaway shareholders meeting, Buffett said that $137 billion is not a large cash pile if bad things start to pile up in the market. Berkshire has major stakes in leading conglomerates like Coca Cola and Kraft Heinz. If the market begins to go in the opposite direction than analysts anticipate, the cash pile can be used to assist Berkshire’s portfolio companies.Bitcoin is at a point where it faces strong overhead resistance in the $9,500 to $9,900 range and the U.S. equities market is still rattled by the economic consequences of the coronavirus pandemic.Given the cyclical nature of Bitcoin, technical analysts weigh towards a correction for Bitcoin after its highly anticipated block reward halving on May 12.As Welt market analyst Holger Zschaepitz said, two previous Bitcoin halvings led to 10,000% and 2,500% gains for BTC.Bitcoin price trend after previous halvings.

As such, any event that significantly impacts the supply of BTC will have a profound effect on the price of the cryptocurrency.The halving decreases the rate in which new BTC is introduced to the market as Bitcoin moves towards capping its 21 million supply. As it gets closer to the figure, theoretically, the Bitcoin price is expected to increase and break out of its previous cycles.The sentiment around stocks and high-risk assets remains cautious due to the uncertainty expressed by major investors like Buffett. But, over the long-term, data suggests Bitcoin is likely to persevere.Long-time investors like Max Keiser are not impressed by Buffett’s recent investment decisions and his view of Bitcoin, however, adding that BTC outperformed most assets, including gold, in the past two months."

16,https://cointelegraph.com,,The Next Bitcoin Halving: To Halve and to Hold?,https://cointelegraph.com/news/the-next-bitcoin-halving-to-halve-and-to-hold,"The upcoming Bitcoin halving may result in greater demand and higher 
prices, but what are the challenges for the 2020 halving? 51611 Total ...",,"Sometimes less is more. That’s a tenet of modern design, but it’s also a central belief of many in the decentralized cryptocurrency community. Throughout the Bitcoin (BTC) world — in Twitter threads, on crypto news websites and in private Telegram and Discord channels — conversation almost invariably turns to one topic: the May halving that will reduce the amount of newly minted Bitcoin by 50%. Less Bitcoin being produced may mean greater demand and higher prices, but to understand just why the community at large is thrilled we need to take a look at Bitcoin’s history.","Bitcoin was intended as a finite and increasingly scarce commodity. Miners need to solve “block” calculations to earn the right to mint the next swathe of Bitcoin. Just as a gold mine grows gradually less efficient as the veins are tapped and the lodes uncovered, Bitcoin mining also grows more difficult over time. The calculations miners must solve grow more difficult, and the rewards grow smaller. When its pseudonymous developer Satoshi Nakamoto launched the Bitcoin network in 2009, any off-the-shelf computer could mine and run a decent chance of winning the 50 BTC block reward. This has lessened over time. In 2020, the individual block reward is 12.5 BTC, and only custom-built and energy-intensive mining rigs have any chance of earning the reward. Bitcoin has halved twice before: in 2012 and in 2016. When the 2020 halving occurs, the reward for successfully mining a block will be 6.25 BTC.The last halving in 2016 led to major increases in Bitcoin’s price, but not everyone is sure that the 2020 halving will inspire similar market adjustments. When the first halving took place in November 2012, Bitcoin was a lesser known asset class. Few people outside the programming, technology and cryptography worlds had ever heard of it. The May halving will be very different. While cryptocurrency may not be widely understood by the general public, it’s now widely acknowledged and covered by journalists and reporters the world over. The news of the halving, even if its exact significance might remain unclear to casual observers, has the potential to draw new people into the world of cryptocurrency and blockchain.While the halving may persuade some users to take the plunge, others in the Bitcoin world may find that the new rules — the 6.25 BTC reward — don’t suit them. Miners may see the price of Bitcoin appreciate, which is something they’re likely to welcome, but there are doubts about whether the theoretical increase in price can match the expected doubling in mining costs. In particular, for miners that run higher electricity costs and those running outdated mining equipment such as the Antminer S9, the mining break-even costs could reach as high as $7,600 to $13,000. These higher break-even costs could force a large amount of miners out of the network but may be good news and provide a larger market share for those that are able to remain.While new miners may be faster and more efficient, driving mining firms to invest in new devices, such as mining rigs, will actually add additional costs, as new mining rigs are expensive and scarce. And that scarcity may not be intentional — there are concerns that coronavirus could break the mining rig supply chain. Though new miners will eventually make their way to mining firms, a delay could lead miners to drastic decisions. Some might temporarily shut down their operations, potentially causing a decrease in the amount of hash power required to solve the mining equations. Halvings are hard enough to prepare for without the complication of a pandemic; the coronavirus may make the forthcoming event even more tumultuous than usual.Even those in the crypto community who do not hold Bitcoin find themselves involved in debates about the effects of a halving event on price. Some maintain that the certain and inevitable knowledge of an event is priced into Bitcoin’s value, and that the market has already considered the drop in block rewards. This means the price already reflects the looming scarcity. Others take an opposite position: Because the cryptocurrency market is young and still maturing, there can be few hopes of forward pricing. While the argument is of theoretical interest to observers, to people and institutions with holdings it’s vital to take a position. Arbitrage and positioning opportunities may exist, but making the wrong prediction could prove exceedingly costly.As Bitcoin grows ever more scarce, especially if this growing scarcity creates a price increase, security grows ever more important for people looking to hold or to transact. New users should follow the standard rules for cryptocurrency security, and they should remember that lost codes or keys mean lost currency. A wallet service could be a valuable safety mechanism for new and experienced users alike, and people who acquire larger portions of cryptocurrency may want to split their holdings between multiple wallet addresses. The next halving will take place on May 12, the exact impact of which — immediate or long-term — cannot be accurately predicted, even after considering the examples of the last two halvings. What is known is that the 2020 halving will impact the Bitcoin community’s future in some shape or form. It may make things — briefly — harder for miners, and it’s liable to bring in hundreds or thousands of new crypto investors. Anyone even tangentially connected with Bitcoin should be prepared for May. Whatever comes, it’s going to be big, and it’s going to be surprising.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.Ashish Singhal is the co-founder and CEO of CoinSwitch and CRUXPay.

From April 23 to May 1, BTC consistently remained above $7,125 for nine consecutive days, leading the TD9 to light up.Bitcoin daily chart prints a TD9. Source: TradingviewHistorical data shows that the TD9 signal typically leads to a 12 to 20 percent near-term pullback in the Bitcoin price. The indicator identifies overextended movements to both the upside and the downside, showing whether BTC is oversold or overbought.The Bitcoin block reward halving is expected to occur on May 12 and in previous halvings the Bitcoin price tended to see a run up prior to the event then a see a sell-the-news style correction right after it.Traders already expect the 2020 halving to have a similar effect as the impact of the 2016 halving on the price of BTC.Cryptocurrency investor and hedge fund manager Logan Han said:BTC halving right in front of our noses. Previous halving - BTC made a dip down and then made its run to ATH.

The recent 40 percent vertical rally with no consolidation phases, the emergence of the TD9 indicator, and the overbought condition of BTC.The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is consistently hovering at 75 percent, which suggests that BTC is overbought after its recent rally. Despite this, technical analysts remain divided on the trajectory of Bitcoin in the upcoming weeks.The dominance of spot volume over futures solidified the theory that the rally from $3,600 to $7,000 was primarily led by actual retail demand, indicating that the rally was organic. But, the run up from mid-$7,000 to $9,400 was mainly caused by the futures market, which may suggest that the uptrend is overextended."

Would selling all his physical possessions include selling his Bitcoin? Does he consider Bitcoin a physical possession?Cointelegraph reached out to Elon Musk for additional details, but received no response as of press time. This article will be updated accordingly should a response come in. Several crypto community members piped up in reaction to Musk's tweet storm. Tron founder, Justin Sun, simply told the tech mogul to ""buy Bitcoin"", while Hodlonaut asked if the billionaire would store his sale profits in the cryptocurrency. In the unlikely event that Musk chooses to park all his wealth in Bitcoin after selling his possessions, he would need to find a way to pick up approximately $39 billion worth of the digital asset.  Bitcoin's entire market cap at press time sits at $161,569,180,962, CoinMarketCap numbers showed. Musk could, in theory, purchase about 24% of all BTC in circulation.Musk would have a hard time buying up that much Bitcoin without spiking the going rate for the asset in the process, however. Cointelegraph recently polled a couple experts on a similar situation — what might happen if Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos tried to buy all circulating bitcoin. The verdict showed the endeavor would likely not work.  "

As she points out, the COVID-19-induced crisis “has defied all our expectations on what normal is” which is why expecting to go back to the status quo is “preposterous.”“We’re not just seeing a repricing of oil. We are seeing a thinking of the entire energy value chain.” Following this event, Demirors argues that geopolitical interests will increasingly shift from access to energy to the access to “compute and connectivity.” She also discusses China’s efforts  “to win the digital race” as an example of this shift. Turmoil in traditional markets is also changing the concept of risk, which is likely to play in Bitcoin’s favour. “With interest rates at zero, there are really no low-risk, stable, fixed income generating assets anymore”According to Demirors, investors’ interest  is moving increasingly towards high-risk, high-reward assets such as Bitcoin. People’s attitude towards volatility is also changing. As traditionally non-volatile assets showed large price fluctuations, Bitcoin’s volatility doesn’t look abnormal anymore and investors’ attitude will change accordingly. Demirors also pointed out that there are still a number of existential threats to Bitcoin. Considering that most Bitcoin holders rely on financial institutions such as exchanges as custodials, their assets can still be frozen or seized by the government. “There are a lot of people who are trying to sell this narrative around Bitcoin as a systemic hedge when in fact, they're taking their bitcoin and they're shoving it right back into the financial system, which effectively negates that sort of argument.”To watch the full interview, check it out on our Youtube channel and don’t forget to subscribe! "

The exchange claims it is “more capital efficient and cost effective than an outright long or short futures trade, while also being less volatile.” The latter argument is persuasive, given that Bitcoin’s share of total cryptocurrency market capitalization has varied relatively less than its spot market price. BTC dominance one year ago was a little under 58% and has remained range-bound between 60–70% since late June 2019 — with one notable flash exception on March 12, 2020.Trading for the contract went live at 9:00 AM UTC today and remains limited to traders in eligible jurisdictions.A Bitfinex representative told Cointelegraph:“Bitcoin has proven time and time again to be a safe haven for traders and it is continuing to be seen as digital gold. Since global markets crashed in March as the COVID-19 crisis took hold, we have seen a huge increase in trading volume, reaching over $2B over a 24-hour period during the crash on March 13th. We believe the demand will still be there after the halving whilst the supply will be halved.”As reported, Bitfinex launched its own social network last month, “Bitfinex Pulse,” to encourage communication between traders.While its parent company, iFinex, was dealt a class action lawsuit for alleged market manipulation at the start of this year, the exchange has been continuing to broaden its offerings, unveiling staking services in early April."

According to the firm, total Bitcoin fees paid over the last 24 hours increased by 50.7% to over $9,500. Furthermore, the Bitcoin mean fee paid by users increased by 58.8%, reaching $0.78.Meni Rosenfeld, the Chairman of the Israeli Bitcoin Association, told Cointelegraph that he believes 24-hour fees show too short a timeframe to be particularly significant. He pointed out that historic data shows that the Bitcoin transaction fee rate is more volatile than the asset’s price itself. Still, he noted that if the trend continued it would acquire more significance:“If the trend continues, a mild increase in fees can be a positive sign. It means people are actually willing to pay those fees — in other words, Bitcoin is increasing in popularity and usage. This can correlate with increases in the Bitcoin price and adoption. If the fees rise too much, though, it's not a healthy sign. It would mean that the technical infrastructure of Bitcoin is failing to scale, making it more difficult for people to benefit from Bitcoin, and stifling Bitcoin's potential to have a positive impact.“Rosenfeld also pointed out that the size of Bitcoin fees is not the only metric that should be observed. He believes we should also pay attention to their variability. He explained:“Rapidly changing fees make it harder to plan ahead and make the most out of Bitcoin. There are some technical proposals, such as ‘elastic block caps’ which I've been advocating, which seek to address this.”Citing mempool statistics from German computer scientist Jochen Hoenicke, Oobit CEO Amram Adar noted that “there's a high correlation between a rise in network fees and an increase in Bitcoin price,"" adding:“The last two periods in which the network suffered from high fees were between April and July 2019 where Bitcoin price rose from $4,200 to $13.800 and in December 2017.”Bitcoin pending transaction fee. Source: Jochen HoenickeFurthermore, Adar said that after the halving-induced Bitcoin speculation craze cools off, he expects fees to return to their usual values. Still, he admits that if Bitcoin sees another bull run, then the higher-than-usual fees could last longer. Lastly, he noted that high fees may not be all that positive for Bitcoin in the short term:“In the short-term, the rise in network fees could cause a problem for consumers, mainly since it’ll be hard to perceive them as justified. It could, perhaps, lead them to shift to other cryptocurrencies, with lower fees and higher transaction speeds, once the media hype over the halving event stabilizes. ”Diego Gutierrez Zaldivar, the CEO of blockchain firm IOV Labs, had a more positive view on rising Bitcoin fees. He explained that high fees generally indicate a high volume of transactions, which he finds unsurprising, given the interest in Bitcoin spurred by the ongoing pandemic and the government’s inflationary measures:“Bitcoin’s scalability issues, which includes the problem of keeping transaction fees low, are well known. However, Bitcoin remains resilient as a neutral store of value, which is why Bitcoin-based sidechains and offchain payments solutions continue to build out a financial system from its foundational layer.”Rosenfeld also explained that in the long term, on-chain transaction fees are expected to rise. Still, he pointed out that the cost of spending Bitcoin may not rise, thanks to the adoption of second-layer solutions like the Lightning Network:“In the long term, the fee for an on-chain transaction should rise, but that doesn't mean that fee for a Bitcoin payment has to rise. As Bitcoin grows, we will see more reliance on 2nd layer solutions such as the Lightning Network. The fee for each payment on the 2nd layer can be very cheap - but the on-chain transaction which opens a channel will be more valuable, thus more expensive.”According to Rosenfeld, “there is a delicate balance with regards to the optimal fee level.” He said that if fees are too low, miners become underfunded. If they are too high, the usefulness of Bitcoin decreases. He concluded:“Fees are generally low now so an increase can be a positive sign, but if they go too high, we will need to seriously consider new scaling solutions.”Many traders have become increasingly bullish on Bitcoin as the block reward halving approaches. As Cointelegraph reported earlier today, Bitcoin hodlers are presently accumulating $530 million of the coin each day.Yesterday, a Bloomberg report stated that Bitcoin is preparing for a bull run reminiscent of the one that the cryptocurrency saw in 2017."

The DVB-S2 protocol for version 2.0 reportedly improves spectral efficiency and signal reliability, delivers higher bitrates, and increases data capacity and bandwidth.Blockstream Chief Strategy Officer (CSO) Samson Mow took the opportunity to take a swipe at rival blockchain Ethereum, commenting on Twitter that “it takes less time to sync a new Bitcoin full node over Blockstream Satellite than it does to sync a new Etherium full node over broadband.”"

This will set my ‘bias’ for the coming days/week most likely.”Cryptocurrency analyst Scott Melker similarly stated that he remains “more bullish on Ethereum than Bitcoin,” acknowledging the optimistic price structure of Ether.Ether’s strong positioning could possibly be due to the strong extended rally from early February but when the crypto market crashed on March 12, Ether dropped harder than most assets. While BTC saw a 50 percent decline, Ether plunged by nearly 70 percent to $90.Ether and BTC performance from record highs. Source: athcoinindexFrom it’s record highs, Ether is down by around 87 percent and BTC has dropped by 63 percent in the same time period.Ether’s oversold setup and the imminence of ETH 2.0 are the two fundamental factors supporting the recent upside movement of the altcoin.The surging demand for stablecoins, many of which are based on top of Ethereum smart contracts, also led to the total amount of value transferred on the network to reach parity with Bitcoin, improving a key fundamental metric of Ethereum.Cryptocurrency researcher Ryan Watkins said:“Stablecoins now account for 80% of daily transfer value on Ethereum, and they’re used for significantly larger transfers on average than Bitcoin. Stablecoins simply have better product market fit for transferring value between exchanges, one of today's dominant use cases.”Whether the noticeable improvement in the network activity of Ethereum and the anticipation for ETH 2.0 are enough to prevent a market-wide correction in the short-term remains to be seen, as some traders warn that the break of a major trendline of BTC is likely to result in a correction."

(BTC) design diverted from his implementation of blockchain. In our ...",,"Blockchain co-inventor, Scott Stornetta discusses why Satoshi’s Bitcoin (BTC) design diverted from his implementation of blockchain.","In our previous articles, we described Stornetta’s views on Satoshi’s background and the philosophical evidence of why Stornetta could have been Satoshi. Now, we focus on an important design difference between the original blockchain that Stornetta created with longtime partner Stuart Haber and Satoshi’s Bitcoin.In the original blockchain, there was no rotation of the block producers. Instead, block validation was decentralized. Also, since there was no built-in cryptocurrency, the reward was paid out in cash. Stornetta believes that Satoshi decided to go with rotation of the block producers to make the network censorship-resistant:“And this is as much for reasons of anti-censoring provisions as it is that he chose to rotate the creation of the next block amongst the community. Whereas for us, it was rotating the validation of the blocks amongst the community.”However, Stornetta, contends that it is the decentralization of the validation that is essential to the cryptographic security, not the decentralization of the block producers:“What is essential to ensure the cryptographic integrity of the system, and the decentralization of validation, is in fact, truly central. It is the unavoidable aspect of making a credible record. But the rotation of the successive block creation, its purpose is not achieving the purpose of increasing the cryptographic strength of the system.”According to Stornetta, there is no danger in having the same party create consecutive blocks as long as the community has a clear view of what is happening and the algorithms control the validation process.Bitcoin whitepaper cites three works Stornetta co-authored. Considering that Stornetta’s foundational paper “How to time-stamp a digital document” was published in 1991, it pondered a question — didn’t Satoshi have something more recent to cite? Stornetta asserts that Satoshi did not have much else to cite since Bitcoin builds directly upon his work:“Let's think a little bit about it, here's a quote of Satoshi’s that I think is interesting. He says ‘Bitcoin is just a decentralized timestamped server for money.’ And so let's break that down. It's a timestamp server. Then he says it's for money. Ours was a general purpose ledger. His was a ledger specifically focused on transfer of an asset on the ledger.”According to Stornetta, the only missing piece from his work that Satoshi had to add to create Bitcoin was decentralized money, the idea that Satoshi likely borrowed from Adam Back’s Hashcash, another work cited in the Bitcoin whitepaper:“But what is not well understood is that the timestamped server itself was already decentralized. OK. What he's decentralizing is the Is the at its heart, it is the injecting of the money into the system that is what he decentralized.”Jokingly, Stornetta suggests another reason why three of his works being cited by Satoshi:“Or another explanation could simply be that, you know, he was a friend of ours and wanted to make us look important.”Stornetta believes that much of the work in the crypto space is focused on solving wrong problems. Meanwhile, he has continued thinking about creating more effective decentralized systems and may release an updated version of a blockchain in the future."

What would happen if he tried? Genesis Mining's head of mining operations weighs in on the matter.","""Of course he could only buy the liquid BTC on exchanges, massively driving up prices in the process,"" Salter told Cointelegraph in an email. Bitcoin has a current circulating supply of 18,339,687, but over the years, industry participants estimate at least some of this supply has been lost by early adopters and miners who no longer are able to access their original stashes.Additionally, the BTC which is currently for sale on exchanges, also called liquid Bitcoin, is only a small fraction of the coins in circulation. ""It's hard to say how many coins are up for sale right now and at what price level investors would stop hodling to sell their coins,"" Salter said.   ""I don't think he could to buy a large percentage of all BTC this way, because when the price starts going up, people will stop selling their coins, assuming there is a new spike approaching and wanting to profit from that,"" he added. If Bezos flooded the BTC markets with buy orders, all the liquidity would rapidly disappear, with surging prices blocking out further buying, Salter explained. Salter mentioned other alternative purchase methods, such as over-the-counter, or OTC buying, as well as picking up stacks of the coin from miners. ""Maybe he could pull off a large purchase without increasing the price immediately by making several deals like this at the same time,"" he said.  Salter did make sure to note that his comments are speculative, however, as he is not currently on top of exchange liquidity levels, or those holding stockpiles of BTC. At a press time price near $7,115, Bitcoin's entire market cap sits at $130,483,137,741. At his current net worth, Bezos could theoretically afford all BTC, and still have about $10 billion to spare. "

Lebanon's lira has resulted in chaotic pricing on Localbitcoins.",,"With Lebanon’s currency hitting new record lows of 4,000 Lebanese lira (LBP) per $1, chaotic prices are being listed by Lebanese Localbitcoins traders.","As of this writing, spreads between listings on both sides of the order book appear to exceed 90%, leading to reports claiming that Bitcoin (BTC) is trading for $15,000 in Lebanon.The spreads appear to be fuelled by an extreme disparity between the market value and official peg of 1,507 lira per U.S. dollar. As such, BTC appears to be trading for a more modest 5% premium at $7,850.Lebanon’s currency crisis is severely escalating, with market prices reportedly dropping from 3,000 lira per $1 roughly two weeks ago, to 3,800 lira per U.S. dollar on April 21, down to 4,000 per dollar on April 24.The country’s central bank, Banque du Liban, has reportedly racked up $40 billion in debt, including $3 billion in the past three weeks and $7 billion this year overall.The crippling economic crisis has seen protestors defying COVID-19 lockdown measures to take to the streets in protest. Riot police donning surgical masks were deployed yesterday when hundreds of protesters gathered at the central bank’s headquarters and began vandalizing the building.Lebanon’s prime minister has criticized the central bank governor, asserting that the bank was either the “instigator of the dramatic drop” or “paralyzed” in the face of the lira’s devaluation, stating:There is a dilemma in the suspicious and mysterious way the central bank governor is dealing with the deterioration of the exchange rate of the Lebanese pound, and that’s causing the collapse. Confusion surrounding the value of the lira has resulted in erratic prices listed on popular peer-to-peer Bitcoin marketplace Localbitcoins.While it appears that Localbitcoins traders are selling BTC for 20 million to 22 million lira — approximately $14,000 to $15,000 using the official exchange rate, most ads on for Lebanese traders stipulate that pricing will be finalized according to the U.S. dollar price. For example, seller hassannasser currently has a listing on the platform to sell BTC for nearly 12 million lira — equating to $7,850. However, closer inspection shows that despite advertising in lira, the pricing is payment in USD, with their listing indicating that prices for trades made in lira will be privately agreed upon:Amount to pay in USD is your trade amount divided by 1500 [...] When paying in LBP you should pay the USD amount multiplied by the USD rate that we should agree on."

Celsius represents the opposite of that. We treat everyone equally, no matter if you have $10 or $10m, and we always act in the best interest of our community.”One day after the United States stock markets scored their biggest monthly rally since 1987 — even as first-time unemployment claims hit a record 26 million — Mashinsky observed that:“Our economy post-coronavirus is going to have an L-shaped level of economic activity but the stock market believes we have a V-shaped recovery. This is mostly due to the floor the Fed put under the bond and credit markets, which made the speculators go wild again.”  The CEO argued that rising demand for crypto lending comes from a section of the public that “does not believe in this story and knows hard times are ahead of us.” Choosing to place more of their assets denominated in Bitcoin with the network, he contended, these users are making use of an alternative means of accessing low-cost loans and earning interest during an unprecedented period of economic uncertainty.As reported, in August 2019 Celsius Network became the fastest-growing crypto-lender with $2.2 billion in coin loan origination. By November, the total loan amount had almost doubled again, reaching $4.25 billion. The network offers varying interest rates on deposits of a wide range of major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ether (ETH) and Litecoin (LTC), as well as altcoins such as Bitcoin Gold (BTG), Dash (DASH), Zcash (ZEC) and EOS. As of this February, the company has begun offering compounding interest on cryptocurrencies deposited in its wallet.Crypto-lending platforms continue to gain traction, with a growing range of players entering the space, such as BlockFi, Nexo, YouHolder and SALT Lending.Last month, crypto exchange and wallet provider Huobi integrated services from decentralized crypto lending platform Cred to enable users to earn interest on their holdings in their exchange wallet."

In a May 4 tweet, the firm noted that the recent correction probably is not a trend inversion in Bitcoin’s movement:“In spite of the minor $BTC correction over the weekend, prices are beginning to rebound close to $9,000 again. According to our metrics, one thing that is still trending in the right direction is the percent of $USDT on exchanges.

Since the beginning, the crypto industry has thrived on social media platforms, as they allow people to connect and share ideas.","Furthermore, the emergence of the very idea of cryptocurrencies and the blockchain can be largely attributed to social networking platforms that facilitated the rise of activist groups such as the Cypherpunks.Therefore, it is no surprise that there is a growing number of social networking platforms built on the blockchain for crypto enthusiasts. Emerging social media platforms such as Mamby and Honest reward their users with Bitcoin (BTC) for posting on the platform. Others such as the Bitfinex exchange are building revolutionary social trading platforms that go beyond copy trading to incorporate networking platforms for specific audiences. Apart from offering cryptocurrency as an incentive to users, others such as eToro have created a multiasset social trading platform with advanced features to the benefit of crypto traders.So, here is a list of social media sites for crypto enthusiasts who love trading, discussing technology and ideas, or simply connecting with others.On Monday, the cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex announced the launch of the Bitfinex Pulse social network. Designed as a social trading platform with a twist, the goal of Bitfinex Pulse is to give crypto traders a leg up in the market by allowing them to collaborate and exchange ideas.Unlike most social media platforms that focus on the interest of the general public, this platform, according to a Bitfinex representative, will focus on the niche of Bitfinex’s users and produce high-quality content for a more technically proficient audience.Bitfinex Pulse will host insightful scoops of data that will be exchanged among the members of the platform. Although users on this platform will be able to publish and share posts, only verified participants can post publicly. In regard to how social networking platforms such as Bitfinex Pulse can maintain freedom of speech, Paolo Ardoino, the chief technology officer of Bitfinex, told Cointelegraph that:“Freedom of speech is maintained as users are just more careful in what they write as we only allow verified users to post public pulses.”While Ardoino identified Twitter and Reddit as the most popular social media sites for crypto enthusiasts, he also mentioned in the announcement that Bitfinex Pulse builds “on the success of the public leaderboard -- which has already created crypto icons on Twitter.”Avid Reddit users will find it pretty easy to transition to Steemit. Just like Reddit, the visibility of powers on Steemit is determined by the number of upvotes that a post receives. This blockchain-based social media platform is the brainchild of Ned Scott, a former financial analyst, and Daniel Larimer. Steemit was launched in July 2016, and the platform’s native cryptocurrency, Steem coin (STEEM), is currently ranked among the top 100 cryptocurrencies. Unlike most incentivized blockchain-based platforms, Steemit rewards its users for commenting on posts or even upvoting other posts.The Steem blockchain was designed in such a way that 75% of mined tokens are used to reward users on the Steemit platform while 15% go to those who hold Steem Power, the platform’s proof-of-stake token. However, after Steemit’s parent company was acquired by Tron’s Justin Sun at the start of the year, the platform has entered uncertain times.The controversial acquisition of Steemit by Justin Sun triggered the Steemit community to create Hive, which, at its core, is a hard fork of Steemit’s blockchain. This social media platform was born after a month-long power struggle with Sun in February. The controversy surrounding the platform aside, Hive is set to feature small alternations of the Steemit code to allow room for improvement in the future. Most importantly, however, is that Hive runs on a completely independent platform and seeks to develop a decentralized social networking hub built by a community of users.Mamby is a social network powered by artificial intelligence that represents the new age of social networks intending to eradicate inaccurate news. With the ubiquitous spread of false information on most social media platforms, Mamby rewards users who post high-quality content. Thanks to AI, consumers are only shown content they are interested in.On top of the fact that the platform does not come with a token sale, as is common with most crypto-centric social network platforms, Mamby rewards its content producers with Bitcoin, which is more appealing to a larger audience of crypto enthusiasts.Therefore, a user can get as much as 0.1 Bitcoin for the views generated by a piece of content. The platform also allows users to post videos, images and text-based messages. Despite its relatively small audience, at its core this social media platform is redefining the idea of earning Bitcoin.EToro boasts to be the pioneer of social trading websites, with a focus on copy trading. The platform was founded in 2007, and it grew rapidly thanks to its offer of stocks, foreign exchanges, commodities, and contract for difference trading. Even though other brokerages have since incorporated copy trading, where novice traders can copy the strategies of an expert trader, eToro stands out because it adds a social media element to the mix.Add this to the fact that its trading platform supports several top cryptocurrencies — including Bitcoin, Ether (ETH) and XRP — and crypto enthusiasts get access to a social networking platform. For crypto enthusiasts who would like to learn from expert traders while dabbling in the stocks and forex markets without sacrificing their appetite for cryptocurrencies, this platform offers a way.Another newly launched social media platform for crypto enthusiasts that claims to improve on the Steemit idea is Narrative. This social media platform was only launched in April 2019, yet it has become a go-to platform for crypto bloggers looking for a more centralized alternative.While decentralized platforms such as Steemit might be praised for their advocacy of freedom of speech, Narrative’s creators seem to buck this trend with a centralized platform that is designed to be censorship-resistant.On Narrative, communities are grouped into particular niches, or tags, that users create. Those who own the most active tags are rewarded by receiving the right to elect moderators. To settle disputes, the platform features a central tribunal that makes decisions and moderates discussions.Tradelize is a decentralized social network built for the trader. The platform was created by traders with decades of experience. This one of a kind social network features advanced tools that use statistics from several crypto exchanges. Just like regular social media websites, a user on Tradelize can create a profile and use the platform to enjoy other social features.As a form of social proof, users can demonstrate the profitability of their successful tactics as well as view the history of other traders. The platform supports a multi-exchange terminal that receives data from eight crypto exchanges, providing access to a majority of cryptocurrencies. Tradelize is mostly attractive to users who are looking to interact with professional traders.ZuluTrade is another social trading platform that competes with the likes of eToro. The platform was founded in 2007, and it allows users to connect with multiple signal providers, copy their trading strategies and read their analyses in a risk-free environment.With its integration of more than 50 brokers around the world, users get access to plenty of signal providers. However, as much as the platform is geared for professional trading, most of its users appear to be amateur traders and there are only a limited number of cryptocurrencies supported.Appics is a blockchain-based social media application that rewards its users for the time spent on the site with the APX token. This application comes with an approach that turns the traditional social media business model on its head. The APX token rewards both brands and individual influencers for their contributions to the platform.Although the platform is still in its beta stage, it holds promise as earnings are not just provided for content creators but also for other stakeholders on the platform.So far, the social media platform has amassed an extensive network of influencers and celebrities in more than 20 countries. Users with the most APX tokens in their wallets are also given a right to vote and have influence over the assigned amount of rewards.Another platform that allows content monetization is Honest. Built on top of the Bitcoin Cash blockchain, this social media platform is more like the blockchain version of Medium. It was launched in November 2018 with the goal of rewarding creatives and freethinkers for their written content; however, the site also allows for videos and photos. Honest is a great place for engaging in discussions about cryptocurrencies, art, the economy and different technologies.Although it’s powered by the Bitcoin Cash blockchain, content creators on the site are paid with Bitcoin for the number of upvotes a piece of content receives. While the Honest platform is still in its nascent stage, the website has a steadily growing community of members backed by an active core team of creators and developers.Built on the Steem blockchain, DTube is the decentralized equivalent of YouTube. The platform uses an InterPlanetary File System, which is a distributed peer-to-peer network for storing and sharing data. According to the DTube website, the combination of the decentralized nature of IPFS with that of the Steem blockchain makes DTube censorship-resistant.Essentially, the power to censor or promote any videos is in the hands of the users through upvotes and downvotes. This social media platform has a keen focus on visual content and allows users to upload, comment, share and watch videos while earning cryptocurrencies.Despite the frustrations that emerge from centralized social media platforms, there is no shortage of decentralized and incentivized blockchain-based social media platforms. For crypto traders and enthusiasts alike, there are plenty of websites to socialize and exchange ideas with other like-minded individuals. However, as Ardoino puts it:“A balance between privacy and freedom of speech is really one of the most complex issues to solve, not really from a technical point of view but from a social and human point of view.”As blockchain technology grows, and as social media increasingly becomes part of our daily lives, innovation will follow suit, leading to the emergence of value-based social media platforms, not to mention the mass adoption of crypto. But for now, the move toward uncensored social networks has begun, and the crypto community is charging ahead of the pack."

And in Africa, where many Paxful users are from, was also hit by this pandemic. Health systems are underfunded and understaffed and many people are living in unfavorable conditions. In response to that, we are starting a #BuiltWithBitcoin COVID-19 Fund for Africa that aims to directly help communities and showcase crypto as a positive force in times of crisis.”Cryptocurrencies can hurdle major roadblocks in fundraising and charity during the coronavirus crisis. According to Youseff: “The peer-to-peer nature of cryptos passes boundaries of traditional finance, in some cases, it is faster and more convenient when transferring funds. In a pandemic, where time is not on our side and we are restricted to move, we need more reliable alternatives and resources to keep our finances flowing - may it be for money transfers or new revenue streams.”Humanitarian organizations will LAO support the campaign, such as Zam Zam Water, which provides access to clean water supplies and develops schools in villages around the world.Looking ahead, Youseff told Cointelegraph that they remain open to expanding to other regions as long as they find “the right partners as we did in Africa.”The COVID-19 crisis has mobilized the crypto community around the world to join in charitable initiatives.Cointelegraph reported on April 8 that a cryptocurrency fundraising initiative for the Italian Red Cross had tripled its initial campaign goal of roughly $ 10,000 in less than four weeks, allowing them to build COVID-19 medical posts in the country."

Looking at its weekly chart, the coin is up by about 5%.Bitcoin 7-day price chart. Source: Coin360An experienced trader told Cointelegraph that it is important that Bitcoin broke the $6,950 level. He also explained that keeping the price over $6,400 is important to avoid a major downward movement, adding that if Bitcoin manages to break $8,200, the upwards volatility of the asset could increase greatly:“When Bitcoin’s price consolidates over $8,200, the trend will be really strong and positive. We could see new highs before the end of 2020.”The total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies at time of publication is $203.1 billion.

crypto-related manga is another weapon that the content industry ...",,A new Bitcoin-themed manga series is set to be published amid a growing interest in crypto.,"The series, titled “Genesis Code”, has already debuted in Japan. It is compiled by the Young Animal manga magazine and distributed by the Tokyo-based publisher, Hakusensha.The publisher released a promotional video on April 28 with the front cover of the first edition. The cover shows the manga’s hero holding a coin emblazoned with the Bitcoin (BTC) logo.According to a synopsis published by the series’ official website, the story revolves around the mystery of Bitcoin’s creation. It is set in 2009; the year Bitcoin debuted.The plot centers on the story of Phantom Wolf, a hacker who recently suffered the death of his father, as he participates in a contest to solve the mystery of Bitcoin’s origin. The prize: 1 million BTC.According to the publisher, if Wolf fails in his quest to solve the mystery, there will be lethal consequences.Other participants in the adventure include a female internet live streamer, a mysterious smartphone app, and two-coworkers that will assist Wolf.There is currently a crisis regarding the creation of new anime. The reasons behind this crisis have to do with an increase in piracy. Much of this illicit activity occurs through illegal manga sites, according to a report by Video Research Interactive.Cryptos have been accused of helping to fuel the proliferation of pirate sites. These sites ask their users to make donations in Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. They also place advertisements on their websites which pay out in cryptocurrency.Cointelegraph reported on April 20 that one of the largest advertising companies in Japan, Dentsu, has partnered with Kadokawa Ascii research labs and others to begin awarding proof of concept rewards to independent content creators, like manga, using blockchain technology."

consolidating with a week left before the halving. 26454 Total views.",,"When Bitcoin (BTC) goes down, Chainlink (LINK) and Tezos (XTZ) go down. But when Bitcoin starts to move upwards, a much bigger move can usually be expected from these two coins as well.","As Bitcoin hit a temporary bottom yesterday at $8,450, so did Chainlink and Tezos, which are ranked 12th and 10th by market capitalization, respectively.Crypto market daily performance. Source: Coin360Chainlink has been hovering between a narrow range, as the $3.85-4 level is seen to be a resistance level while the $3.40-3.50 level can be confirmed as support.As the price of Chainlink was moving towards that support yesterday, the big question arises whether it was capable of holding that level for support one more time. The result was a 10% bounce.LINK USDT 3-hour chart. Source: TradingViewJust as Bitcoin is consolidating inside a range so is Chainlink. Support levels are clearly defined with the $3.40-3.50 area, while the resistance at $3.85-4 remains the key level to break.As the range tightens, a volatile move can be expected to occur shortly. A breakthrough above the $3.85-4 resistance level will likely trigger continuation towards the $4.60-5 areas, while a breakdown below the $3.40 level indicates weakness and likely continuation towards $2.90 and possibly $2.25-2.40.LINK USDT 1-day chart. Source: TradingViewAs the chart is showing, the price of Chainlink has found support at the previous high of $3.40. As long as that remains support, upwards continuation is likely. The levels are clearly stated from previous highs.A breakthrough above $4 warrants continuation and a possible move towards $4.85-5, which is equal to a breakout of Bitcoin above $9,300 since Chainlink usually follows the movements of Bitcoin.LINK BTC 4-hour chart. Source: TradingViewHowever, is Chainlink showing strength recently, or is it Bitcoin that is holding up the USD level of Chainlink? The latter seems to be the case. The BTC pair of Chainlink has been showing weakness, as it dropped more than 20% in the past two weeks.Is that a strange occurrence? No, because the halving for Bitcoin is a week away, which makes investors more interested in Bitcoin than in altcoins. Therefore, investors are selling their altcoins to jump on the Bitcoin train.This is perhaps why altcoins are dropping in their BTC pairs while the USD pairs remain relatively stable. Altcoins will likely catch up to Bitcoin after the halving.The chart is showing a potential bullish divergence on the 4-hour chart, which indicates a possible trend reversal. Bullish and bearish divergences are important indicators in determining the direction of the current trend.Confirmation for a short term trend reversal would be a double bottom structure or a breakthrough above the 0.00042600 sats resistance. Breaking that level would warrant continuation towards the previous support at 0.00045600-0.00046500 sats.What levels are important to hold for Chainlink? It’s crucial to hold the 0.00039000 - 0.00040000 sats level for support. If not, then 0.0003300 sats will come back to play.XTZ USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingViewThe Tezos chart is showing a similar structure as Chainlink, as the price is consolidating inside a narrow range. The support area can be defined from the $2.55-2.65 area, while the resistances are found at $2.85 and $3 (latter was a peak rally).However, the price is continuing to make higher lows, a crucial factor for further continuation of upwards momentum. Therefore, as long as the green zone between $2.55-2.65 can remain support for Tezos, further upwards momentum is warranted.What are the resistance levels key to watch? The resistance levels to watch are the $2.85 area (as that’s the range high, as the next chart shows), but also the level between $3.20-3.30.XTZ USDT 1-hour chart. Source: TradingViewThe range structure is quite identical to the Chainlink chart. A break of the $2.85 pivot would indicate further upwards momentum with a small resistance at $3.The next major resistance for Tezos is found between $3.20-$3.30, as previously stated.XTZ BTC 4-hour chart. Source: TradingViewThe BTC pair of Tezos is showing a similar structure as Chainlink. The USD value of Tezos is remaining relatively stable, while the BTC pair is showing a significant selloff of more than 20% in the past two weeks.The conclusion remains the same. Investors are getting rid of their altcoins in anticipation of a further surge of Bitcoin, as the main focus and priority is currently on Bitcoin and the halving.However, when the halving passes, altcoins should receive more attention. One of them should be Tezos, as it’s been one of the most significant performers of the past year, and the other one is Chainlink.The BTC pair of Tezos is showing a similar bullish divergence on the 4-hour chart as Chainlink. Such a bullish divergence can indicate a short-term reversal for Tezos, where the 0.00003000 sats level should hold as support (a wick towards 0.00002900 sats could occur).If this area holds, some upwards tests should be expected with the next resistance area at 0.00003300-0.00003400 sats.A breakthrough of that resistance could warrant a significant surge, as the next resistances are pretty far away. On the other hand, losing the 0.00003000 sats level would warrant further downwards pressure. The level to watch would then be the 0.00002500 sats level.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

The firm plans to list on either Nasdaq Global Market or the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker EBON. The move comes nearly two years after the company sought to conduct a $1 billion IPO in Hong Kong. After submitting its filing in June 2018, the offering had been halted by the end of the year.In 2019, 82% of Ebang’s revenues came from its application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) chips and fabless integrated circuits for miners. Ebang’s annual revenue was $109 million last year. Declining demand for mining hardware amid falling crypto prices resulted in a 66% drop in growth from $319 million in 2018.Gross profits swung from $24.4 million in 2018 to $30.6 million in gross losses during last year Ebang’s chip sales fell from 415,930 at an average price of $737 to 289,953 chips for $304 on average.Ebang’s filing asserts that demand for its products is directly tied to fluctuations in the price of Bitcoin:Market demands and unit price of Bitcoin mining machines correlate with the economic returns of Bitcoin mining machines and are primarily affected by the Bitcoin price. A rise in the Bitcoin price will generally increase the market demand for Bitcoin mining machines, which in turn will allow us to price our products higher, and vice versa.“The decrease in the Bitcoin price in 2018 and the first quarter of 2019 resulted in a material decrease in our sales volume and in the average selling price of our Bitcoin mining machines,” said Ebang, adding: Although the Bitcoin price started to recover in the second quarter of 2019, our operations generally lag behind the increase of Bitcoin price.The filing states that Ebang has completed the design for its proprietary 8 nanometer (nm) and 7 nm ASC chips, adding that it is ready to mass-produce the 8 nm units “when the market conditions become suitable.”Ebang is also working on the development of “proprietary 5 nm ASIC chips and mining machines” for altcoins, including Litecoin (LTC) and Monero (XMR).The company states that it intends to begin “applying blockchain technology into non-cryptocurrency industries, such as the financial services and healthcare industries.”In November 2019, mining manufacturer Canaan Creative raised $90 million in an IPO — less than one-quarter of its $400 million target.Since launching on Nasdaq for $9 per share, Canaan’s stock price has fallen over 50% to trade for $4.23."

believes that cryptocurrency, but not Bitcoin, is the way forward in a ...",,"On April 29, Cointelegraph participated in a fireside chat event organized by the Webit Foundation. The panel, with the title of “Can blockchain be a solution for the upcoming economic crisis,” featured Roger Ver from Bitcoin.com as the main speaker.","Like all events during the Coronavirus pandemic, the panel was held virtually, with its participants dialing in via video conference. The talk was hosted by Dr. Plamen Russev, executive chairman of Webit Foundation. The chat featured Roger Ver, Bitcoin.com’s executive chairman, and Kristina Lucrezia Cornèr, managing editor at Cointelegraph, as a Q&A moderator.Ver’s answers at the panel can be summarized as a deep belief in freedom and libertarian economics. He believes these ideals to be the answers to the crisis at hand. He also focused on censorship — an issue that has regained relevance amid the Coronavirus pandemic.Ver was greatly disturbed by the harsh censorship policy enacted by Youtube in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. He cited an example of two doctors who made statements going against the mainstream narrative behind the pandemic, and whose video was deleted a few days after it was published.The policy is allegedly the culprit behind a new wave of bans to crypto content creators, which recently hit high-profile influencers like Tone Vays and Crypto Lark.Ver explained his view against censorship:“I think the solution to people saying crazy or wrong things is other people being able to rebut those things, not massive censorship.”When discussing censorship, Ver also threw several jabs against the Bitcoin community, and said that his biggest regret throughout the years was “not being even louder when speaking out against censorship in the cryptocurrency community.”This refers to 2015, when the moderators of the /r/Bitcoin Reddit forum began censoring any discussion relating to Bitcoin XT — a proposal for larger blocks in Bitcoin (BTC) that can be considered as the ideological ancestor to Bitcoin Cash (BCH).Ver holds a utilitarian view of the purpose of cryptocurrency, focusing heavily on its use as a censorship-resistant payment system. He emphasized that it is free trade that creates wealth in the world, while the lockdowns destroy the ability to trade freely and thus, the economy. He also considers the multi-trillion dollar stimulus package to be theft of a similar nature to counterfeiting money.Cryptocurrency, as the freest form of money, would be the best tool to escape the government’s excessive control, according to Ver. But he also believes that it can only happen when cryptocurrency is used for payments, which is something that Bitcoin is no longer useful for, he claimed: “The sad part about what everybody is calling Bitcoin today, it doesn’t have those characteristics that made the early investors and adopters so excited about it early on. Most of those people are now working on things like Bitcoin Cash or Ethereum.”He claimed that most of its current supporters are either speculators betting on future speculation, or people who “still didn’t figure out that the project is no longer trying to be cash for the world.”You can check out the full panel by clicking on this link."

traditional finance during the COVID-19 pandemic could underline the ...",,"In 2007, Nassim Nicholas Taleb, a former Wall Street trader turned professor, described the idea of a “black swan” event. Black swans are defined as being rare, of major consequence and impossible to predict, though he tempered their predictability with an acknowledgment that, in hindsight, they are explainable.","A confluence of events has arisen in 2020 to create a black swan event unlike anything the world has witnessed since the Great Depression. It dwarfs even the 2008 financial crisis.After the global financial crisis of 2008, Taleb spoke of the importance of factoring in the possibility of black swan events and argued that their impacts are more catastrophic if systems are propped up artificially. Taleb believed in creative destruction, rendering black swans less potent when they arise.Having been insulated from downturns for 12 years, the global economy has proven unable to cope with the assault that these unprecedented times have launched upon it. The magnitude of the impact of “COVID winter” has proven Taleb right.The seismic health emergency has unleashed a series of interconnected shocks and coincided with other phenomena at play, leaving the global financial system reeling in the aftereffects.These are the very conditions for which Bitcoin (BTC) was designed.The coronavirus spread from Wuhan, China, to all parts of the country during New Year celebrations and would soon make its way around the world. The United States, the United Kingdom, Italy, Iran and Spain would bear the brunt of it after it originally swept through China, South Korea and Japan.It has left untold damage. As we approach the end of April, it has put over 25 million Americans out of work, with lockdowns in place in most of the nation. The country’s financial capital became the new epicenter after Wuhan and northern Italy before it. The virus overwhelmed Spain’s healthcare system. Within five months, it has claimed more than 200,000 lives worldwide.With unprecedented unemployment filings and workplace closures, governments have unleashed stimulus packages to help get their citizens through the shutdown period. According to the U.S. Congressional Budget Office, Congress’s fourth stimulus bill of $500 billion has taken the total cumulative dollar amount of relief packages in the country to $2.4 trillion, including spending packages and tax cuts. Globally, governments have pledged over $8 trillion in cash injections and relief to small businesses and households. Germany and Italy have committed over 30% of their respective gross domestic products in coronavirus aid.With the travel and retail sectors ravaged by the suspension of almost all commercial activity, the economic impact of the pandemic is likely to last years, if not decades. No amount of stimulus can support economies through the full extent and duration of the fallout.The U.S. Federal Reserve slashed interest rates to zero in mid-March as it became clear the virus had made substantial inroads into American lives and markets. It launched a $750 billion quantitative easing program to shore up the financial system.Japan renewed its commitment to quantitative easing, which the Bank of Japan has been pursuing for over a decade. The Bank of England, the European Central Bank and the People’s Bank of China followed suit. With barely any abatement from the monetary looseness in the world’s major economies that has followed the global financial crisis, quantitative easing has begun to look like the new normal. Taleb recommended allowing weak systems to fail so that economies would have the arsenal to deal with potentially catastrophic blows. Following the Lehman Brothers collapse, it appears nobody heeded his advice. There are very few levers left to pull other than to print money to purchase assets.Stock markets aren’t buying it. While they have recovered somewhat, March 23 saw the S&P 500 down 34% from its peak in February. Oil futures dipped into negative territory as a glut of oil made it more expensive to store. The breakdown in talks between Saudi Arabia and Russia left the world with increasing production levels just when COVID-19 caused governments to close down their economies, needing far less energy resources than usual.In mid-May, Bitcoin’s block rewards will fall from 12.5 to 6.25 BTC. The third halving will result in Bitcoin’s annual issuance falling to a rate that places its stock-to-flow ratio around that of gold. And the smart money wants in. Cryptocurrency fund manager Grayscale recorded its highest ever inflows in the first quarter of 2020.Bitcoin-related chatter on Twitter was dominated by the coronavirus in February, by gold in March, and has recently seen an uptick in halving related topics as the event approaches. Bitcoin is the only asset to have fully recovered from its coronavirus-related plunge in mid-March.Debate around Bitcoin’s most promising use case has raged since it was invented. To some, it is a hedge against inflation. To others, an escape from the corrupt, inefficient banking and financial services infrastructure. Some like to spend it. Others like to invest in it. Others prefer to use it to speculate.In reality, Bitcoin can be any of those things to different people. Regardless of what Bitcoin does best, it is quite clear that the current circumstances in which we find ourselves represent an alignment of many of the risks from which Bitcoin is ideally suited to shelter us. The world faces a glut of fiat and oil. Bitcoin supply is about to head in the opposite direction. Bitcoin was inspired by a financial crisis and a mistrust of centrally controlled money.It is Bitcoin’s time to shine. And whether it does or not will determine whether it becomes the central focus of the future of finance or little more than a short-lived historical novelty.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.Paul de Havilland is a fan of disruptive technology and an active investor in startups.

The synthetic dollars are backed by Bitcoin, however, users without cryptocurrency knowledge can simply buy and transfer cryptodollars by depositing cash at one of Valiu’s thousands of remittance partners in Colombia.Sid Ramesh, an advisor to early-stage startups, posted a video detailing the app's operation, with Chomarro sending him one cryptodollar from his smartphone in less than 30 seconds.Valiu CEO has described a recent influx of migrant workers from Venezuela coming into Colombia as the inspiration for the cryptodollar project, as many had been using a risky black market for remittances that developed as a result of Western Union and MoneyGram becoming increasingly subject to capital controls.Valiu has been providing fiat currency-based remittances to Venezuelans for seven months but hyperinflation meant recipients ended up with less bolivars during the time it took to arrive. “99% of remittances still arrive in bolivars,” Valiu’s head of research Alejandro Machado tweeted earlier this month. “Dollars cash hardly make it across borders, especially in the middle of #COVIDー19 lockdowns.”While Venezuelans are experiencing hyperinflation, some experts now believe the U.S and Australia are headed for deflation due to the lockdown induced slump in demand."

The best (and worst) quotes, adoption and regulation highlights, leading coins, predictions and much more — a week on Cointelegraph in one link.","It’s a nail-biting time for Bitcoin owners. The cryptocurrency mounted a strong rebound and surged from $6,800 to $7,600 this week — with a dramatic surge on Thursday taking many traders by surprise. But the question now is whether these higher prices are here to stay. On Sunday, Bitcoin needed to hold above $7,475 or else its price was prone to retest underlying support levels. Two technical factors could push BTC to $8,000 near-term as traders anticipate a strong weekly close. Some Cointelegraph analysts, such as Michaël van de Poppe, also believe BTC has the potential to hit $9,000 — with just over two weeks to go until the halving. Alas, there are also signs that the upsurge was a bull trap, not least because altcoins aren’t rallying in tandem with BTC. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index shows investors remain extremely cautious about Bitcoin’s short-term prospects. Currently, the score stands at 21 — “extreme fear.”A new Bloomberg report this week was exceedingly flattering about Bitcoin and suggested that the cryptocurrency is preparing for a mahoosive bull run. The report claimed that Bitcoin and gold stand to be “primary beneficiaries” of the coronavirus-induced market turmoil. With BTC’s correlation to the precious metal hitting all-time highs, it added that Bitcoin could be about to transition from a “risk-on speculative asset to the crypto market’s version of gold.” The “Bitcoin Maturation Leap” report adds that the inception of BTC futures has tamed “the raging bull market” — with authors predicting that volatility will continue to decrease. This is significant since the all-time low volatility in October 2015 “marked the beginning of the bull market.”Hodlers are accumulating more coins every day than at any time in over a year, according to data from Glassnode. The monitoring resource says we’ve seen a significant increase in BTC positions this month. At current rates, hodlers are adding in excess of 75,000 BTC to their positions each day. All of this comes as mentions of the Bitcoin halving spike on Twitter — with data from TheTIE suggesting that crypto media coverage may be starting to shift away from the coronavirus. Block rewards are going to be slashed by 50% next month, and as ever, there’s lively debate over whether the event has already been priced in. If you’ve been to our homepage today, you’ll know that we’ve now got a shiny new countdown to the halving, and it’s estimated to happen on May 12. If you want to read more about what a halving actually is, you can find our handy guide here.Earlier this month, Cointelegraph reported that KuCoin’s primary web domain Kucoin.com has been locked by a Singaporean court. The exchange hit back — alleging that the article was “untrue” and “unverified.” This week, Cointelegraph published new evidence surrounding its original report. Andrew Capon’s original story had included a screenshot of an email that GoDaddy had sent to KuCoin, in which the exchange was told that its domain name was locked in light of an order issued by the High Court of Singapore. (Note: the KuCoin website remains accessible in Singapore, as the order means that the domain name cannot be transferred from one owner to another.) Cointelegraph has since obtained the original email file, and we have been able to authenticate that the email was indeed sent by GoDaddy. There’s a lot we don’t know about the court order, but we do know one exists. Neither KuCoin’s representatives nor any of the entities involved in the legal action have responded to requests for comment.A new legal fight is also brewing in California. Ripple Labs has filed a lawsuit against YouTube, and the company is seeking damages for the video-sharing site’s alleged failure to stop XRP scammers and impersonators. Brad Garlinghouse, Ripple’s CEO, claims the scam — often referred to as “The XRP Giveaway” — has already defrauded victims out of crypto worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. The sophisticated scam allegedly sees the owners of legitimate YouTube channels targeted with a malicious email, meaning attackers gain control of their accounts. It’s claimed these credentials are then used to strip the creator’s YouTube accounts, with the channel transformed into one that impersonates the official pages of Ripple and Garlinghouse. Viewers are then urged to send “between 5,000 XRP and 1,000,000 XRP” to a listed address, which promises 5 times the returns from the recipient. YouTube is accused of profiting from the scam by “knowingly selling paid ads on behalf of fraudsters” — and awarding verification badges to channels taken over by the scammers.At the end of the week, Bitcoin is at $7,646.84, Ether at $197.84 and XRP at $0.19. The total market cap is at $220,694,686,067.Among the biggest 100 cryptocurrencies, the top three altcoin gainers of the week are DigiByte, Aave and MaidSafeCoin. The top three altcoin losers of the week are Terra, Synthetix Network Token and Swipe.For more info on crypto prices, make sure to read Cointelegraph’s market analysis. “We see that significant quantities were cashed out during bull markets of Bitcoin, and net new positions were accumulated by HODLers in bear phases.”Adamant Capital, Bitcoin alpha fund“A bet on Bitcoin is a bet that the deflationary pressures will win.

This question does NOT make me a hater.”Peter Brandt, veteran traderA damning new macro report claims Bitcoin can rally to $1 million, but the coronavirus means that the baby boomer generation is, well, “f*cked.” Global Macro Investor CEO Raoul Pal says the COVID-19 pandemic is inflicting “incomprehensible” damage on the U.S. pension system. Summarizing the market losses seen since March, he wrote: “The Baby Boomers will sell every rally they can to protect their last, rapidly diminishing nest egg. The Baby Boomers are totally f*cked. I have been publicly warning and warning about this.” Since the report was published, we’ve seen a bizarre trend where stocks have been recovering even as record levels of unemployment have continued to worsen. Pal believes BTC represents a striking exit opportunity from the rapidly deteriorating status quo over the next five years, estimating: “I think it can get to $1M in the same period. I think it can go from a $200B asset class to a $10T asset class.”Ethereum Co-Founder Vitalik Buterin took a veiled swipe at Craig Wright this week, the Australian entrepreneur who claims to be the pseudonymous Bitcoin creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. Wright has previously claimed that nChain, where he works as chief scientist, has filed more than 800 applications for blockchain patents, and has been granted between 50 and 100. In a scathing tweet, Buterin argued that this is beside the point, writing: “If you’re bragging about how many ‘blockchain patents’ your country/company/organization has, you don’t understand blockchains.” Meow. This prompted vitriolic responses from others on crypto Twitter, with Wright’s mentor, Calvin Ayre, firing back: “You tech has been used for more scams in the ICO shitecoin storm than the world has ever seen.”The United States Attorney’s Office has seized a fraudulent COVID-19 domain name after its owner attempted to sell it in exchange for Bitcoin. CoronaPrevention.org was put up for sale on a “hackers forum” the day after President Donald Trump declared a national emergency in response to COVID-19, the U.S. Department of Justice alleges. An undercover agent engaged with the domain’s owner on the forum and pretended to be selling fake coronavirus kits. The site’s owner said this was “genius,” and allegedly added that there had been the intention to do the same but “couldn’t get enough cash to bulk buy them on Alibaba.” The domain name has now been taken down and redirected to the Justice Department’s notice of seizure.A ransomware gang has published personal and financial data from the Californian City of Torrance online — and threatened to reveal 200GB more unless their demands are met. “DoppelPaymer” is demanding 100 BTC, worth about $760,000 at the time of writing, in exchange for not releasing any more of the files stolen in the March 1 cyberattack.

The StateScoop website reports it has examined the files and uncovered individuals’ names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, and other personal information.

features of ZCash, using Drivechain technology. 4392 Total views.",,"Developers are competing to bring ZCash privacy functionality to a Bitcoin sidechain. To do this, they’re using the Drivechain technology created by decentralized prediction market pioneer, Paul Sztorc. As an added incentive, Sztorc has announced a prize fund of up to 6.1 Bitcoin (BTC). This bounty will reduce slightly if not claimed by midnight EST on May 1.","Drivechain is an implementation which allows for the creation of Bitcoin sidechains with a true two-way peg. This would allow Bitcoin holders to move their coins to any sidechain they choose. Doing this could allow users to benefit from characteristics and features not found on the main Bitcoin blockchain.This could be a sidechain with large blocks and low fees, with smart contracts, or even with the enhanced privacy features of an altcoin, like ZCash (ZEC). Zcash functionality provides an ideal complement to the transparency and auditability of Bitcoin.Bitcoin which is transferred to a sidechain is effectively held in escrow by miners, until it returns. To any outside observer, it is impossible to prove that the owner has been benefiting from ZCash privacy technology.Sztorc has provided a Drivechain sidechain template and challenged developers to do a “code transplant” from ZCash. This would essentially turn the altcoin into a sidechain. As both are code forks of Bitcoin, most of the source code already overlaps, meaning much less work.The prize fund is to encourage developers to investigate his Drivechain technology, and create a proof-of-concept for further testing. The challenge was set on April 20, and at time of publication, nobody had claimed the prize. It is set to run until the upcoming Bitcoin halving on May 12.If any challenger is successful, this could pave the way for various flavors of BTC which are capable of taking on the characteristics of any blockchain asset. If that happens, it could potentially render all altcoins obsolete."

bananas are a better means of exchange than Bitcoin.",,"In a recent appearance on Anthony Pompliano’s The Pomp Podcast, billionaire investor and owner of the NBA’s Dallas Mavericks, Mark Cuban, discussed his qualms with Bitcoin (BTC).","Despite arguing that Bitcoin is hampered by a lack of understanding among the general public and poor fungibility for goods without fiat conversion, Cuban offers that Bitcoin may find success if economic crises accelerate and “everything goes into the shitter.”When asked what it would take to change his position of skepticism regarding Bitcoin, Cuban stated: “It would have to be so easy to use it's a no brainer.”“It’d have to be completely friction-free and understandable by everybody first, and then you can say it's an alternative to gold as a store of value,” he added.“You’re going to have to make it friction-free so grandma can do it, adding “the fact that we are arguing so much about it, and you have so many stands about Bitcoin — that just proves the point, that it's difficult.”Cuban argued that Bitcoin comprises a cumbersome means of exchange through lacking fungibility for goods and services without converting into fiat currencies.“Right now, you still have to convert it for anything that you want,” he stated, adding: “[A]s long as you have to convert it, you are still dependent on fiat, no matter what you say.”“I can trade bananas easier as a commodity than I can trade Bitcoin, and I can still eat that banana before it goes bad, and get all my potassium for my workout.”Cuban recounts briefly supporting payments in Bitcoin on the Mavericks’ online store four years ago, stating “no one bought anything.”After reintroducing support for merch and ticket purchases in BTC in August 2019, Cuban estimates that the payment method has brought in $130 dollars, adding: “that’s all of the Bitcoin that I own right now.”While Cuban acknowledges blockchain can offer great opportunities, he asserts that “we haven’t really seen blockchain applications really take off. I get all of the arguments, I’ve seen all of the charts, I understand all of the potential problems with fiat,” he states, adding:“It's to Bitcoin’s potential benefit if everything goes into the shitter because we’re printing so much money and there’s global implications.

exchange, but global regulations and slow internet connections could ...",,"While most crypto businesses keep out of Cuba due to regulatory uncertainties and hefty American sanctions, Italian-Cuban entrepreneur Mario Mazzola developed and deployed Cuba’s first peer-to-peer Bitcoin (BTC) exchange.","Blockchain and cryptocurrency news outlet Decrypt reported on April 23 that Mazzola launched the “ultra-lightweight” Bitcoin exchange earlier this month.A Reuters report published in September 2019 quoted a 35-year-old Cuban mobile shop owner, Jason Sanchez, saying that virtual currencies were “opening new doors” for ordinary citizens.While there is interest in using virtual currencies and an opportunity to circumvent U.S. sanctions, Cubans face difficulty using cryptos as most exchanges have geo-blocked them from accessing their services.Mazzola defines Bitcoin as a necessity for Cubans, but with most services blocking users, they fail to reap the benefits. In such a situation, he adds, Qbita will serve as their tool to buy, sell, use and store Bitcoins easily and safely.Before launching the Qbita exchange this month, he had already launched the Qbita Bitcoin wallet in November 2019. The wallet is specifically designed keeping in mind the slow internet services in Cuba, which is why it is just 1MB in size and can function with a basic internet connection.There are other cryptocurrency exchange and wallet services in Cuba like Paxful and LocalBitcoins but Mazzola said that each of them has “a little problem.”“Paxful is actively blocking Cuba, LocalBitcoins is asking you for KYC, and because of the embargo, this legal requirement is not helping the people of the island, so it is not available in our country.”Since the launch of the Qbita exchange, the number of registered downloads have shot to 1,100 from 850, marking a 30% increase in just a week.While the numbers aren’t huge, Mazzola is optimistic that Cubans would soon see the potential of Bitcoin in national and international transactions.“We're going to see more people using Bitcoin for its true purpose: the freedom to move money and to have total control of your funds."""

with a particularly high failure rate, according to a group of ...",,"The Telegram group, started by Arseniy Grusha on May 1, co-founder of United States-based cryptocurrency consulting and mining firm Wattum, contains several complaints about Bitmain products, primarily the Antminer S17+. “I have never seen such defective production before,” Grusha wrote on his LinkedIn page on May 4. “In case you have a similar problem, I have created a telegram group where you can share your experience with the latest deliveries of these miners.”","In an interview with Cointelegraph, the mining entrepreneur explained that his company received 420 Antminer S17+ devices in March after a month-long delay caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. According to him, around 30% of the machines started glitching after only one month of use. Normally, defective miners account for just 5-7% of the whole order, Grusha noted.Among the units, 32 stopped working due to ‘ERROR_SOC_INIT’ error, while 99 now only work using just one or two hashboards out of three, with 80% of the latter group ostensibly having this problem straight out of the box, according to Grusha.“Part of the miners just stopped working,” he said, clarifying that all of the purchased miners have been using the latest official software from Bitmain. “The other part have bad hashboards and their power is lower by 30 and 60%.”The Wattum exec has already contacted Bitmain, who apparently appointed him a specialist and new firmware. “Will have results in couple days,” Grusha told Cointelegraph, adding:“But we still have 32% of bad units. They should be sent to China, and as a result, we lost money on mining before [the] halving and will [have to] wait two months for repair, which of course does no good for us.”When asked whether he was considering going to court, Grusha replied:“I sent a request for compensation, and asked to send new miners instead of the bad miners. Let's see what they answer first.”Others in the group, which boasts almost 140 members after being created on May 1, reported somewhat similar failure rates. Mike Hamilton, chief technology officer at New York-based energy startup Griid, shared his experience after receiving a large batch of Antminer S17 50T units:“We've got about 700/1800 machines with at least 1 hashboard down after 3 months. About 300/1800 with at least 2 hashboards down, and probably 150/1800 with all 3 hashboards and/or PSU failures.”Matt D’Souza, CEO at Blockware Mining, recalled having a 19% defective rate after deploying a thousand Antminer S17+ units in a hosting facility based on freight containers. He got a much lower defective rate of 2% after launching another 1250 of the same model miners at a different facility.Earlier in April, Samson Mow, Chief Strategy Officer of blockchain infrastructure firm Blockstream tweeted that Bitmain customers have a 20-30% failure rate with Antminer S17/T17 units. Mow also speculated that Bitmain CEO Jihan Wu blames ousted co-founder Jihan Wu for the problems and “is begging customers to give the S19 a chance.”As previously reported by Cointelegraph, Antminer S19 were designed to produce increased mining output after the Bitcoin halving, which will make it more difficult to mine new coins. Bitmain sold out its first round of domestic Antminer S19 sales within 24 hours, while the units would not be shipped until May 11 at the earliest, which is roughly the same day the halving occurs.Cointelegraph has reached out to Bitmain for a comment, but has yet to hear back from the company. This story will be updated should we receive a response."

This represents a 32% increase over 2018, which had in turn presented a 212% increase over the previous year.Bitcoin (BTC) payments to CSAM providers, 2015-2020. Source: ChainalysisNonetheless, Chainalysis emphasized that this stark year-on-year rise is not necessarily reflective of an absolute rise in CSAM demand, but is likely to reflect a rise in the level of adoption of cryptocurrencies across all sectors.$930,000 in Bitcoin represents “a miniscule fraction of all cryptocurrency activity” — and yet the industry should be concerned about such usage of cryptocurrencies in a criminal and deeply exploitative industry, Chainalysis says.While cryptocurrencies may have become prevalent among criminal content providers due to their perceived pseudonymous properties, Chainalysis notes that the blockchain can in fact provide investigators with actionable data that sheds light on the profiles and activities of those involved.Among the key patterns identified in the report are frequent low-value payments — typically between $10 and $50 in Bitcoin — sent between 11pm and 5am. While small payments account for the lion’s share of transactions, CSAM providers do draw a significant percentage of their revenue from much larger individual payments. Other signs of illicit CSAM activity include cryptocurrency transactions that are tied to prepaid credit and debit cards, or those made repeatedly to one address (or group of addresses controlled by the same entity). Crypto payments to known escort services or other adult services providers or the purchase of crypto tokens that target the adult industry specifically can provide law enforcement with further data points towards an analysis of the CSAM darknet sector.As Cointelegraph has reported, listings site Backpage — described as “the world’s largest brothel” —  was seized by the United States Department of Justice in 2018. CEO Carl Ferrer later pleaded guilty to conspiracy and three counts of money-laundering, in part via cryptocurrencies, admitting he had been aware that the “great majority” of the site’s ads were for prostitution services. Ferrer had laundered $500 million in revenue through multiple bank accounts and sites that included Coinbase, GoCoin, Paxful and Kraken, among others."

Bitcoiners believe 'unlimited money printing' will cause hyperinflation 
and ...",,Many Bitcoiners believe that 'unlimited money printing' will cause hyperinflation and a major BTC price spike this year — but experts in the U.S. and Australia predict deflation is more likely to be on the cards.,"The Reserve Bank of Australia, ING Bank, The New York Times and UBS are just a handful of organisations who think deflation could be a consequence of falling oil prices and a glut of products due to the plunge in demand caused by lockdownsThat's in stark contrast to the “Money printer goes brrrr” crowd who believe that “unlimited quantitative easing” this year will inevitably lead to hyperinflation and see a surge in demand for Bitcoin with its fixed supply of just 21 million coins.A new survey by Paxful of 500 crypto users found that more than half of Bitcoin holders in the U.S. see the cryptocurrency as a hedge against inflation.Crypto analyst Plan B argues that money printing benefits Bitcoin, and his stock-to-flow price model is predicated on the block reward halving in May reducing the rate of Bitcoin's supply and pushing up the price. Bitcoin's annual inflation rate after the halving will be 1.8% while gold will be at 2.5%.It’s interesting to note that inflation in the US actually fell 0.4% in March to 1.5% — and many believe that inflation will only go down from here. New York Times Senior Economics Correspondent Neil Irwin wrote this week the negative oil price was a sign the world is in “a deflationary moment"".“The Covid-19 crisis is an extraordinary deflationary shock to the economy, causing the idling of a vast share of the world’s productive resources,” he wrote.In the case of oil, that’s because demand has fallen off a cliff, leading to a glut of product and pushing prices negative. He argues that similar supply and demand effects will be seen across the economy. Demand has slumped everywhere from restaurants to airlines, sports arenas are empty, and 22 million workers have filed for unemployment.""All of that points to a deflationary collapse — a glut of supply of goods and services, and consequently falling prices — that surpasses anything seen in most people’s lifetimes.ING Bank's Chief International Economist James Knightley has made a similar point and argues that the collapse in energy prices and surging unemployment will soon see a “negative headline CPI” (Consumer Price Index).In his article ""US: Deflation is on its Way"" he pointed out that expectations that quantitative easing (QE) would lead to inflation hadn’t been borne out “after the Fed’s QE1, QE2 and QE3 programmes"" following the Global Financial Crisis. He suggested the dollars from the money printer would probably go into propping up financial assets, rather than into the pockets of consumers.Knightley cited the minutes of the Fed Reserve's March meeting that suggest they believe that even with money printing and the economy reopened, ""inflation was projected to weaken"".The Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia Philip Lowe said in a speech this week the country faced the biggest hit since the Great Depression and that deflation was a likely outcome in the June quarter.“The large fall in oil prices, combined with the introduction of free childcare and the deferral or reduction in some price increases means that it is quite likely that year-ended headline inflation will turn negative in June. If so, this would be the first time since the early 1960s that the price level has fallen over a full year.”The RBA has fired up the money printer for the first time in its history, but told national broadcaster the ABC recently the incredibly low inflation rate in the decade after the GFC was a good indication inflation was an unlikely outcome.He’s backed up by UBS chief economist George Tharenou who said the oil price, falling rents and desperate discounting by retailers due to low consumer demand will see the Consumer Price Index in Australia fall by 1.5% over the next three months.Plan B may well be right that Bitcoin is a good hedge against inflation. After all, Bitcoin is already being used for that purpose in countries such as Venezuela and Zimbabwe that are experiencing hyperinflation. Arcane Research has also published research suggesting demand on LocalBitcoins in Argentina has just hit record highs, partly due to increasing inflation. And it’s hard to argue with those who point out the purchasing power of $1 in USD has dropped around 99% over the past century.But while Bitcoin may be a good hedge against inflation, if the experts are to be believed,  there’s not a lot of inflation that’s likely to occur —  in the near future at least."

based on Bitcoin-powered RSK and its second layer solution RIF.",,A startup has launched a leveraged token and a decentralized stablecoin based on Bitcoin (BTC)-powered RSK and its second layer solution Infrastructure Framework layer (RIF).,"According to an announcement shared with Cointelegraph on April 21, Bitcoin-based decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol MoneyOnChain launched the new products on RSK’s sidechain.The new DeFi platform, dubbed RIF on Chain will feature RIF Dollar (RDOC), RIFX and RIFpro (RPRO). RPRO is a token that mirrors the price of RIF but also grants passive income by collecting a share of the fees generated by platform transactions.RDOC is pegged to the United States dollar and backed by RIF, the tokens powering RSK-based decentralized applications. Unlike competing Ether (ETH)-backed decentralized stablecoin DAI, RIF Dollars can be acquired directly by spending RIF without creating a collateralized debt position.The RDOC stablecoin is minted every time there is a certain amount of RIFpro staked on the platform. Lastly, RIFX is a token that gives exposure to RIF’s price fluctuations with leverage. Max Carjuzaa, MoneyOnChain CEO, explained:“RIFX is a RIF leveraged decentralized long position. Based on an automated smart contract that renews every 30 days, the product has a leverage factor of 2X at the very beginning of its lifespan and a variable leverage afterwards based upon certain variables such as the price of RIF token and the amount of RDOC stablecoins in the ROC platform. Users must be aware of the risks. [...] The ROC platform, in this current version, does not have a Margin Call notification.”Carjuzaa pointed out that RSK is merge-mined with BTC and leverages Bitcoin’s blockchain for security. He also explained that Bitcoin as an asset is integrated into the system and its role will be expanded in the future:“Bitcoins are locked on-chain and RBTC tokens are minted on the RSK network accordingly. RBTC (and thereby BTC) will serve as collateral for loans, as a pegging mechanism for RIF Dollar and more.”As Cointelegraph reported in March, lead developer at blockchain firm Kava Labs Ruaridh O’Donnell pointed out that there is great anticipation for the development of Bitcoin’s DeFi ecosystem. When it comes to the broader DeFi space, it is seeing great developments at an astonishingly fast rate.As Cointelegraph reported earlier today, Ethereum-based DeFi protocol Synthetix recently enabled tokenized real-world assets like Brent oil and the Nikkei stock index. The CEO of blockchain firm Trustology recently said that he believes DeFi protocols could soon emerge as the world’s dominant liquidity pool if scaled effectively."

However, Bitcoin’s supply is controlled with code. Moreover, the rate of production of new Bitcoin will be halved next week.Although an argument could be made that although Bitcoin mining cannot be altered by greater demand, still, its supply is not inelastic. The amount of the asset that long-term holders take out of the short-term supply responds to price.Furthermore, McGlone states that the combination of Bitcoin’s anti-inflationary supply framework and the unprecedented central bank stimuli, creates a perfect environment for Bitcoin to outperform other markets:“Restricted supply means adoption is the metric that matters, and most indications remain positive in an unprecedented environment where virtually every central bank is aggressively adding liquidity.”According to McGlone, another key metric likewise points to Bitcoin’s strength. 180-day volatility has hit an all-time low, the last time the market witnessed such a significant drop in the asset’s key risk metric was before the biggest bull run:“The all-time low in Bitcoin 180-day volatility is notable for signaling the bull market commencing in 2015 and ending in 2017.”Also, McGlone believes that there is evidence in the increase of “buy-and-hold” types, he observed that the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust’s assets under management expand during price dips:“What's notable is the recent record high in this demand metric occurred on the back of the March swoon in Bitcoin's price, as the stock market plunged. It's an indication of support below Bitcoin -- investors have been responsive buyers on price declines. At about 330,000 Bitcoin equivalents at the beginning of May, GBTC represents about 2% of supply.”"

Source: TradingViewAlthough XTZ has been on a tear in both its BTC and USDT pairs, the altcoin has encountered resistance at the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement levels just as Bitcoin (BTC) and many other altcoins are at the moment. As can be seen on the daily chart, XTZ formed a near tweezer-top at $2.85 before pulling back below the 61.8% Fib level. The recent move above $2.58 pushed XTZ price above the ascending channel but prior to this each 25%+ move higher was followed by a retest of the underlying support so the current pullback could simply be a repeat of XTZ’s previous price action. Currently the price is held up by the high volume VPVR node at $2.72, but a drop below this level would likely bring the price to the top channel of the ascending channel where there is support at $2.59. Below this, traders will look for a bounce at the 50% Fib level ($2.44). Below the 50% Fib level the next support is at $2.35. The relative strength index has turned down slightly but remains above the ascending trendline and in the bullish zone. BTC USDT 4-hour chart.

The recent movements are showing that the crucial area of $0.1775 is holding as support and setting up for more upside for XRP.The main resistance level to break for the XRP price would be the red zone between $0.2025-0.2125.

This support area held, after which accumulation started, resulting in a massive breakout to $3 in January 2018.The current price action is also starting to look similar, though it took longer to retrace.

At the same time, the price of XRP needs to make a higher high to sustain momentum.For that, support at 0.00002500-0.00002525 satoshis needs to hold for support, after which the resistance levels will be tested.

The primary levels to watch for support are 0.00000718-0.00000722 satoshis and 0.00000680-0.00000685 satoshis.If either of these levels provides support, then buyers will likely step in. Such a move should warrant further upwards momentum.XLM USDT 1-day chart. Source: TradingViewMeanwhile, the USDT chart for Stellar Lumens is showing a clear breakout of the resistance level at $0.054. This breakout led to a significant surge in price as the price of XLM rallied towards $0.065.This move grants a 155% surge since the low of March 12, also known as Black Thursday. However, is the rally over for now? No, because after such a breakout and surge, the dips will likely be bought up given the current uptrend.An apparent retest of the previous resistance level at $0.054 would provide the most likely entry for traders to step in. Resistance levels are found significantly higher, with the first level lying at $0.074 and the second one at $0.08.However, if this push fails to hold the $0.054 level for support, further tests to the downside are likely to occur. The primary level to watch for will then be the $0.04-0.043 zone.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

CEO, Jeff Bezos, tried to buy all Bitcoin in circulation.",,"Crypto trader and YouTuber, Tone Vays, explained that Amazon's $140 billion CEO couldn't buy every Bitcoin (BTC) in circulation. ","What would happen if Bezos tried? ""He would drive up the price of Bitcoin to the point where he could no longer afford it,"" Vays told Cointelegraph in a message on April 23. On the day of Vays' comments, all the speculative capital held within Bitcoin gave the asset a total market cap near $137 billion, with each coin priced at approximately $7,500, CoinMarketCap data showed.  In the last 11 years, roughly 18,343,537 BTC have circulated the market. A number of those coins, however, sit in various wallets and platforms with longer term holding in mind. Some early adopters even lost unknown amounts of likely unrecoverable BTC. Essentially, only a certain amount of BTC is liquid, or immediately tradable, on exchanges and markets. ""Bitcoin is a very illiquid asset,"" Vays said. If Bezos tried to buy all available BTC, everyone would begin buying up Bitcoin after hearing the news, which would take the asset's price even higher, Vays explained. Continuing his explanation, Vays said the situation might also cause fear in the market. ""If he did achieve the purchase of a significant chunk of Bitcoin to rival Satoshi, or even say 25% of all Bitcoin, he could then cause some panic in the market with people thinking he might dump any moment, crashing the price,"" Vays explained. Vays referenced a similar situation seen roughly 40 years ago. Between 1979 and 1980, the Hunt brothers, W. Herbert and Nelson Bunker, attempted to purchase all silver on the market, also called ""cornering the market,"" an article from Business Insider detailed.  Similar to what Vays believes would happen with BTC, the Hunt brothers' mass buying resulted in silver's market value surging from $6 to $50 per ounce, Business Insider said. ""The government stepped in to shut it down,"" Vays said of the Hunt's silver buying caper. ""I can also see the government stepping in if an American tried to corner the market,"" Vays said of Bitcoin, noting the asset's mainstream prevalence.Philip Salter, Genesis Mining's head of mining operations, also gave his opinion on the same hypothetical scenario on April 22. "

Similar to cashback rewards from major credit cards: the more you spend, the more Bitcoin rewards you earn.Okung told Forbes he believes “finding more ways to EARN bitcoin is just as important as getting more people interested in simply buying bitcoin.” Earlier this month Fold announced it had joined Visa’s Fintech Fast Track Program and will launch a Fold Visa debit card that offers Bitcoin rewards. Okung said it “represents a significant step towards mainstream adoption of Bitcoin. We're excited for our partnership and the opportunity to introduce even more people to the best money in the world.""Okung has become something of a crypto educator since tweeting “pay me in Bitcoin” in May 2019. His company has since hosted a Bitcoin conference in Los Angeles. He said that he saw Bitcoin as “a practical solution to overcome the imminent demise of the legacy financial system”:“Bitcoin changes everything. As economic uncertainty continues to take its toll on our everyday lives, I believe we’ll see more and more people experience a shift in how they relate to money.”With the investment in Fold, Okung adds himself to a list of prominent sports figures and celebrities endorsing cryptocurrency. Boxer Floyd Mayweather promoted Centra, a cryptocurrency project that raised over $32 million during its initial coin offering, but whose founders were later charged with fraud by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. In basketball, Brooklyn Nets point guard Spencer Dinwiddie recently announced he was promoting crypto-based lending and borrowing platform Cred.With the upcoming BTC rewards halving, others have been using their platforms to encourage buying and holding the cryptocurrency. Former UFC fighter Ben Askren even changed his Twitter name to remind his 300K+ followers of the halving, expected May 12."

The phenomenon is already at work in Europe, while Kocherlakota foresees U.S. institutions swallowing the pain instead of hoarding money as cash.“...Economists now recognize that doesn’t happen, because it’s costly to store billions (or trillions) of dollars of paper currency safely,” he continued.President Donald Trump has repeatedly voiced his support for lower rates, last year directly criticizing Fed Chair Jerome Powell for failing to make cuts dramatic enough. Now, he may finally get his wish. Fed interest rate 60-year chart. Source: MacrotrendsFor proponents of Bitcoin as sound money, however, such decisions are causing increasing alarm. Negative rates and negative commodity prices, combined with unprecedented government spending, creates a paradoxical situation which many economists throughout the past century have concluded is unsustainable.As RT hosts Max Keiser and Stacy Herbert explained in the latest edition of their Keiser Report financial news show, negative rates equate to time costing nothing.“When we got to negative interest rates, when time had no value, that was one thing,” Herbert said.“...Now we have the negative cost of energy, so does E = mc2 any longer?”Earlier, Cointelegraph reported on criticism from ex-presidential candidate Ron Paul, who says that the Fed’s model has already fallen apart."

It pointed out that the plaintiff’s had even submitted his Twitter posts to the court. ""Plaintiffs follow Mr. Nguyen’s social media, yet fail to explain their failure to serve Mr. Nguyen at any of his public appearances in 2019 or 2020""The Kleiman Estate filed a motion on April 6 to compel compliance with two subpoenas, one to produce documents and the other for deposition testimony.They argued they had served Nguyen via email on March 10, and via Twitter on March 29. But Nguyen’s team said the email had been sent to his defunct nChain address, and both the email and Twitter messages had merely asked if he was willing to accept a subpoena that way:""Both the email and Twitter requests were only that — requests. This is similar to asking a party to accept mailed service of a summons; the party has no obligation to agree, and the mere asking of the question is not itself effective service""On other dates they attempted to serve him at his home in February, he was in Moscow for the Future of Sports & Blockchain Conference, and then in London for the CoinGeek conference, which he said they could have watched live on YouTube:""Plaintiffs  did  not  effect  service  on Mr.  Nguyen because  he was  traveling  outside  the country on each attempted service date in February and March.  Plaintiffs needed only to have performed Google searches to discover Mr. Nguyen’s publicly-promoted appearances.  Had they done so, they (a) would have realized that Mr. Nguyen was not at home and (b) could have served him in person at one of his conferences.They did neither.""Kleiman's lawyers also claim to have served Nguyen the subpoena by certified mail on April 1, but Nguyen submitted evidence the delivery had been unsuccessful because there was “no authorized recipient” available to accept it.So if he’s not at home, where is he now? Nguyen’s lawyers said that since late March “he  has  been isolating in  safe  and  remote  locations due  to  the  COVID-19  global pandemic.""Given Nguyen didn’t become involved with Wright until years after Kleiman passed away in 2013, he’s not an obvious candidate as a witness in the case. In December 2017, Nguyen became CEO of nChain — where Wright works as Chief Scientist, before assuming the role of President of the Bitcoin Association (which promotes BSV) one year later.Nguyen’s submission points out that although he was listed as a potential witness as far back as May 2018, the Kleiman team didn't seek to subpoena Nguyen before the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th revised discovery deadlines that have passed since the case began February 2018. It wasn't until a month after the fifth revised discovery deadline that the plaintiffs began attempting to serve him:""Plaintiffs’ complete  lack  of  urgency  in seeking  discovery  from  Mr.  Nguyen  over the  past two  years undermines  any claim that  Mr. Nguyen’s testimony documents are critical to the Florida Lawsuit."""

As much as 95% of those cryptos are nothing but scams, according to the creator of the world’s first proof-of-work, or PoW, crypto.","Emin Gun Sirer, the creator of the first PoW-based crypto, the Karma System, is confident that the vast majority of cryptos do not represent any tech advancement and only exist to grab people’s money.In an April 29 AMA session with Equilibrium EOSDT, Sirer slammed crypto projects like Facebook’s Libra for wanting to compete with major fiat currencies, like the United States dollar and euro, while not creating anything new.A computer scientist and professor at Cornell University, Sirer believes that the vast majority of crypto projects are touting their initiatives as new payment methods, while Bitcoin (BTC) was the first to do so more than 10 years ago.“There’s nothing wrong with wanting to be a method of payment, but Bitcoin did it first,” Sirer argued, adding that “trying to compete with that is a stupid thing to do.”Sirer designed the first PoW crypto protocol back in 2003. This was about five years before Bitcoin creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, published the Bitcoin white paper. The scientist emphasizes that he is far from being a Bitcoin maximalist. However, Sirer does support Bitcoin maximalists who believe that as much as 95% of cryptos are useless.Sirer said:“I hate the Bitcoin maximalist approach. I’m a science-driven person. If there is a good thing out there, I’m the first one to call it out. But they’re right in labelling 95% of the things out there as scams. It’s just a money grab with somebody’s initial coin offering [...] They are pushing a coin with a system that doesn’t advance the world.”Instead of creating a world-changing technology, the majority of crypto projects are just following the same model laid out by Satoshi, Sirer noted. “People like Justin Sun are walking around like they have something special, but they’ve just recycled something that belongs to someone else,” he said.Apart from creating the Karma System, Sirer is known for founding consensus algorithm startup, Ava Labs. As reported by Cointelegraph, the computer scientist revealed his plans for Ava in March 2019, with a mission to create a blockchain network that is able to run as many transactions per second as payment giant Visa.Sirer is not alone in thinking that over 90% of existing cryptos are useless. Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple, the company behind the third biggest crypto, XRP, believes that 99% of all cryptos will go to zero because they are not focused on solving real problems."

Greenspan says such a value indicates almost no correlation at all. He argues, “nothing has emerged that’s said ‘crypto is going to be our savior.’” Bitcoin is still considered a “risk asset” and “hasn’t achieved the safe haven status that gold has taken thousands of years to build up.”Pausing to feed his child some snacks, Greenspan continued his talk on “How to Invest in a Post-Virus World” by zooming in on Bitcoin’s 2020 performance against the U.S. dollar.Yellow = gold; green = USD; blue = S&P500; white = silver; purple = crude oil; orange = BTCScreenshot from Virtual Blockchain WeekBitcoin has been “one of the best performers” as the economic impact of the coronavirus really took effect in April.

The contest aims: “To deploy technology, including artificial intelligence  (‘AI’), to help the CFTC identify foreign entities that may be engaged in conduct that requires registration, but which have not registered.”Included in the types of offerings listed as matters of concern for the project are Bitcoin (BTC) derivatives, and contracts for other CFTC-regulated cryptocurrencies.Speaking to Cointelegraph, LabCFTC Director Melissa Netram described Project Streetlamp as the first — but hopefully not the last — science contest that the regulator has taken part in:""We're excited to launch it because it's the first time that the commission has ever done something like this, and we're hoping it's the first of many.”Netram further commented on the importance of “the role innovators play to help government agencies, like ours, fulfill our mission of protecting investors.” In announcing the project, CFTC Chairman Heath Tarbert said: “To stay ahead of the curve, we need forward-thinking approaches like the tools that may arise from LabCFTC’s Project Streetlamp, especially as they enhance our ability to keep consumers informed and ultimately, protecting their investment funds.”The contest aims to widen the range of the CFTC’s registration deficient list, or “RED List.” The list currently includes just over 150 entities that the commission has identified in the aims of providing a resource to investors. Regarding the current path for updating the RED List, Netram said it depends on consumers contacting the CFTC with potentially unauthorized foreign offerings. “We usually receive tips from consumers,” she explained, “and then we proceed with our own investigations.""Project Streetlamp looks for new tools to streamline the search for such offerings.Winners will be named CFTC Innovator of the Year. There is no cash prize, but the contest does not grant the CFTC ownership over the projects. After the competition is finished, winners will have the opportunity to go through the CFTC’s usual procurement process to bring any tools that they want to have on board for future expansion of the RED List. The CFTC in general and LabCFTC in particular are highly active in crypto markets in the United States. At the end of March, the commission issued new rules governing the physical delivery of derivatives for crypto assets like Bitcoin.Around the same time, Netram’s predecessor at LabCFTC, Daniel Gorfine, along with former CFTC Chairman J.

He emphasized that the work he does for Bloomberg Intelligence is objective and devoid of salesmanship:“I'm Bloomberg Intelligence. They're all completely objective. And this does not reflect the views of Bloomberg at all. I'm completely objective in my outlook in the market. I don't make investment advice or recommend recommendations.”McGlone has decades of experience as a commodities trader and has been really impressed with Bitcoin’s robustness:“The stock market had its biggest correction since the Great Depression, down 15 percent. I view that as quite significant that Bitcoin is weathering this storm yet. And the key thing I find about it, it's never stopped trading, never stopped, never halted, didn't have a third party guiding it. I view that as someone who's been trading commodities my whole life is very impressive.”He also added that his bullishness is exclusive to Bitcoin:“I'm not bullish on anything else other than Bitcoin. I think the rest of the market is just a bunch of five thousand wannabes.”McGlone does not believe that the upcoming halving will have any impact on the Bitcoin price, since it is something that the market has already factored in:“it's a non-event. Complete non-event, it’s for amateurs. Since when do known knowns matter in markets?”McGlone alludes to one of the main tenets of financial economics theory — the efficient markets hypothesis, which suggests that all the known information is already priced in. As a Bloomberg analyst, McGlone is not allowed to discuss price targets. Nonetheless, he pointed out some key support and resistance levels:“So I think the key resistance people are gonna be looking at is $10,000 and that's very doable. I would be very disappointed if it trades much below $5,000 support.”McGlone believes that all the fundamentals are “very positive”. McGlone’s views may be perceived as contrarian by many in the crypto community. We are less than 20 days from the halving, and have not yet witnessed any major price movements."

Let’s analyze the charts to find out.Bitcoin (BTC) was stuck close to $7,500 levels between April 23-25. The only positive thing was that the bulls did not allow the price to dip and sustain below the breakout level of $7,454.17 during the period.BTC–USD daily chart. Source: TradingviewThis attracted buying on April 26, which helped the biggest cryptocurrency to resume the recovery. However, the bulls are struggling to push the price towards the immediate target of $8,000.The current recovery has been gradual with several intermittent periods of consolidation. Even after breaking above resistance levels, the BTC/USD pair has failed to pick up momentum. This suggests a lack of confidence among the bulls that the rally is on a strong footing.When the trend is weak, it is susceptible to a pullback on any adverse news. If bears sink the pair back below the breakout level of $7,454.17, a drop to the 20-day exponential moving average ($7,190) is possible.If this support holds, the bulls will make another attempt to carry the pair to the $8,000-$8,175.49 resistance zone. Above this zone, the rally can extend to $9,200.Conversely, if the bears sink the price below the 20-day EMA, a drop to the 50-day simple moving average ($6,676) is possible. The trend will turn negative on a break below $6,471.71.The stops on 50% of the long positions can be kept at $7,000 while the rest can be trailed higher to $6,450. This move will reduce the risk and protect paper profits.Ether (ETH) rallied close to the psychological resistance at $200 on April 26 but could not break above it and reach the resistance of the ascending channel at about $207. This suggests that the bears are defending the $200-$207 resistance zone.ETH–USD daily chart.

The pair will pick up momentum on a break above the channel and will turn weak on a drop below the channel. Therefore, the stop-loss on the long positions can be trailed higher to $160.XRP has been trading above the 20-day EMA ($0.189) for the past four days but the bulls have not been able to carry the price to the top of the $0.17372-$0.20570 range.

Hence, the stop-loss on the long positions can be kept at $0.170.Conversely, a strong rebound off the 20-day EMA will signal renewed buying interest. If the bulls can drive the price above $0.20570, a new uptrend is likely. The first target to watch out for is $0.25 and then a rally to the long-term downtrend line at $0.28.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has been struggling to break above the overhead resistance of $250 for the past four days.

a significant hurdle for large mutual fund managers, especially when ...",,"For the past two years, crypto-media outlets and Bitcoin (BTC) advocates have placed heavy emphasis on the need for institutional investors to embrace the cryptocurrency sector. The oft-stated belief was that institutional inflow would lead to mass adoption and an incredible spike in the value of crypto-assets as a whole.","Fast forward to the present, and the total cryptocurrency market capitalization has yet to reach the $750 billion all-time high seen in late 2017.The slow recovery of crypto prices raises a few hard to answer questions. If institutional funds have been flowing into cryptocurrencies, why hasn’t there been a significant price increase over the last three years?Either there is an almost infinite sell pressure — which shouldn’t be a barrier considering the total crypto market cap is just $248 billion — or this theory that institutional investment will pump crypto prices does not hold. Here are three reasons why institutional investors have yet to join the crypto market.Investing in Bitcoin, the top listed crypto asset on CoinMarketCap, remains a significant hurdle for large mutual fund managers, especially when considering their perceived risk of Bitcoin.Add to this the additional purchasing steps necessary, compared to more traditional assets, and the process of just buying crypto is off-putting. Some funds’ internal regulation also does not allow investments of specific products, while others are ousted by the low liquidity in regulated and approved venues.The arrival or presence of institutional investors does necessarily translate into buying pressure. Renaissance Technologies Medallion Funds’s recent entry into CME’s Bitcoin futures markets is a perfect example.Furthermore, it should be noted that since CME futures are cash-settled, they don’t necessarily involve any Bitcoin trading activity. More importantly, a hedge fund can also open short positions.Investors should wonder: Why should they celebrate a $10-billion fund potentially entering the space looking to bet against Bitcoin’s price?Yes, there has been significant growth in the crypto derivatives market, and these are preferred instruments among institutional-size investors, but they remain incredibly complex for the average retail investor.Building positions via futures might come in at a high cost, as contracts expire every two months. Furthermore, this would mean investors would take on the risk of trading at a negative premium to the spot market, as there is usually a cost involved in switching to the next expiry.Simply put, futures contracts are not designed for long-term holding.While Bitcoin does produce amazing returns, there are other reasons why a $94-trillion industry will not just blindly buy cryptocurrencies anytime soon.Cryptocurrency market cap in perspective. Source: BitcoinIRANo matter how many times one has seen the chart above, it remains pretty impressive. The crypto sector’s $248 billion market cap is just a speck among capital markets. Currently, Japanese yen banknotes in circulation amount to $1 trillion, and this does not include bank deposits nor treasuries.The world’s 20 largest asset managers combined oversee $42.3 trillion. A mere 0.5% investment in cryptocurrencies would end up at $211 billion — equivalent to 84% of the total market cap.Even though the past few years have shown that crypto can provide an infinite upside, one must concede cryptocurrencies are not even close to being at the same playing field as traditional markets. Grayscale Investments manages $3 billion, the largest available publicly-traded vehicle for institutional investment in cryptocurrencies.Despite such a significant amount, it remains insignificant in the eyes of the world’s largest money managers.Top 7 owners of JPMorgan & Bank Of America shares. Source: CNN BusinessBanks, credit cards, insurance and brokerage companies represent a significant portion of the portfolio for almost every large asset manager. BlackRock, State Street, Vanguard, Fidelity and Wellington consistently feature as the top 20 holders of financial stocks.Banks are a relevant player in this field as HSBC, JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank, BNP Paribas, UBS and Wells Fargo figure among the world’s largest mutual funds managers.This relationship goes deeper as banks are relevant investors and distributors of such independent mutual funds. This entanglement goes even further as large financial industry players dominate equities and debt offerings, coordinating investment funds’ allocation in such deals.There’s not much room to be gained for any mutual fund manager to sit at the wrong side of the table when the subject is the traditional finance industry.At the moment, cryptocurrencies are in no way a threat to Visa, Wells Fargo, Chubb or Charles Schwab. It doesn’t matter how well decentralized finance is performing or how sizable Bitcoin transactions are right now.Therefore, the question investors should be asking is: What is preventing institutions from engaging, and what would it take to get them to invest in cryptocurrencies?Former Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman J. Christopher Giancarlo admitted in October 2019 that his agency deliberated with the Treasury, the United States Securities Exchange Commission and the National Economic Council to suppress Bitcoin’s incredible 2017 rally.This government-backed plan culminated in December 2017 as CME and CBOE both listed Bitcoin futures contracts — one day after Bitcoin’s famous $19,700 top.In May 2019, U.S. member of congress Brad Sherman called on colleagues to outlaw cryptocurrencies. President Donald Trump tweeted back in July 2019:“I am not a fan of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air.”More recently, the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin promised “significant new requirements” on cryptocurrencies.In October 2019, U.S. senators went as far as sending out a letter to three companies backing Facebook’s Libra cryptocurrency project, citing “risks the project poses to consumers, regulated financial institutions, and the global financial system.”Despite Bitcoin not being widely regarded as a competitor to fiat money, it is almost sure that it would be if the cryptocurrency achieved a trillion-dollar market cap.BAKKT has a product designed to ease mutual funds’ significant barrier to Bitcoin investment. Bitcoin futures contracts with physical delivery allow purchases throughout an entirely regulated venue, including the custody process.As reported by Cointelegraph, BAKKT is controlled by the Intercontinental Exchange, the owner of the New York Stock Exchange. Clients willing to trade such products must do it through the regular brokers used for stocks and futures.BAKKT’s Bitcoin Monthly Futures contracts volume. Source: Twitter @BakktBotFor ages, retail investors awaited BAKKT’s launch, as its arrival was prophesied to be a signal that the crypto sector had received the blessing of institutional investors. Estimates of a new all-time high being reached in 2018 and 2019 were relentless and more often than not, wrong.After launch, what seemed like a perfect solution produced an average daily volume, which to this date, remains irrelevant. There are numerous reasons this could be taking place:Although internal fund regulations can be changed to accommodate Bitcoin investing, it might not make much sense right now for multi-billion-dollar investment funds. Analysts and portfolio managers proposing the addition of a new asset class in secular mutual fund managers would be taking an immense personal risk.The intention of this piece is not to turn away investors from Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. Pundits and analysts with no real market experience have promised impossible scenarios for far too long. If the Bitcoin market cap is still under $1 trillion, rest assured you’ve arrived early to the party, and that’s not necessarily a good thing.There is possibly an unlimited upside for this asset class, and institutional investors’ entrance will almost certainly happen gradually, then suddenly. Right now, it is essential to realize that a multi-trillion-dollar mutual fund industry hasn’t got strong enough reasons to invest in such a nascent asset class.Crypto does not need the mutual funds industry; it is the other way around. Bitcoin is money for regular people and an investment by itself.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

Source: Coin360While Bitcoin is likely to hog the limelight this week, a few altcoins have also formed bullish patterns. This suggests that if Bitcoin prices remain strong, these altcoins could also move higher. So, let’s look at the top five bullish setups that could offer short-term trading opportunities this week.Stellar Lumens (XLM) rallied and closed (UTC time) above the overhead resistance of $0.053194 on April 22, which completed a bullish ascending triangle pattern. This setup has a target objective of $0.076388.XLM-USD daily chart. Source: TradingviewUsually, when the price breaks out of a bullish setup, it tends to return and retest the breakout level. However, in some cases, the momentum is so strong that the price only consolidates for a few days and then resumes its up move.Both moving averages are sloping up and the relative strength index is trading in the overbought zone, which suggests that bulls have the upper hand. The XLM/USD pair has also been consolidating above the immediate psychological support of $0.060 for the past two days. This indicates that the bulls are not closing their positions in a hurry as they expect higher levels in the next few days. XLM-USD 4-hour chart. Source: TradingviewThe sharp rise from close to $0.050 to $0.066102 shows a flagpole formation. Following the sharp up move, the XLM/USD pair has made a pennant, which usually acts as a  continuation pattern. A strong breakout of the pennant signals the possible resumption of the up move. The bulls broke above the pennant but are struggling to hold on to the breakout. This suggests selling at higher levels.Therefore, the traders can wait for the price to close (UTC time) above $0.063327 before buying. The initial stop loss can be kept at $0.060. As the price moves northwards, the stops can be trailed higher to reduce the risk and protect the paper profits.The bears might aggressively defend the overhead resistance at $0.066102 but if this level is crossed, the move can extend to $0.073 and then to $0.078.Cardano (ADA) broke above the double top that was forming at $0.0369205 on April 23. This attracted buyers and the altcoin rallied to the next overhead resistance at $0.0437998 on April 24. ADA-USD daily chart. Source: TradingviewAfter a day of consolidation on April 25, when the ADA/USD pair formed an inside day candlestick pattern, the bulls have broken above the resistance of $0.0437998. However, the bears are unlikely to give up without a fight as they are mounting stiff resistance at higher levels.  With both moving averages sloping up and the RSI in the overbought zone, the advantage is with the bulls. If the bulls can sustain the price above $0.0437998, it could result in a rally to $0.052 and then to $0.061 in the next few days.ADA-USD 4-hour chart. Source: TradingviewThe 4-hour chart shows a flagpole that formed after the pair broke above $0.0369205. That was followed by a pennant formation as the bears defended the overhead resistance at $0.0437998.However, today, the bulls have broken above the pennant and have pushed the price above the overhead resistance at $0.0437998. Therefore, the bulls can buy at the current levels with an initial stop loss at $0.0412, which can be trailed higher as the pair moves up.The first target to watch on the upside is $0.0504 where partial profits can be booked. This bullish view will be invalidated if the bears sink the price below $0.04192. Bitcoin (BTC) has been leading the recovery from the front. With the halving approaching, the leading cryptocurrency is likely to remain in focus next week. On April 23, the bulls broke above the critical resistance of $7,454.17.BTC-USD daily chart. Source: TradingviewHowever, the BTC/USD pair has not been able to pick up momentum as the bears are aggressively selling on any rise. But the positive thing is that the bulls have been maintaining the price above the breakout level of $7,454.17, which indicates strength.Both moving averages are sloping up and the RSI has broken above the 60 mark for the first time since mid-Feb., which shows that bulls have the upper hand. The next level to watch on the upside is the $8,000-$8,146.84 resistance zone.BTC-USD 4-hour chart. Source: TradingviewBitcoin had been trading in a tight range of about $7,605-$7,435 for the past few days. Attempts to break above or below the price range did not sustain. Even today, the bulls broke above the range but the price has again slipped back into it. This shows aggressive selling by the bears at higher levels. Along with the range, a pennant formation can also be seen on the charts. The bulls purchased the dip below the pennant today, which suggests strong buying at lower levels. If the bulls can push the price above the pennant, the up move is likely to resume. The target objective of this breakout is $8,393.25.Therefore, the bulls can buy on a breakout and close (UTC time) above the pennant. The initial stop loss can be kept at $7,380, which can be trailed higher after the pair moves above $7,740.37. If the bulls struggle to break above $8,000, the stops can be tightened further. This bullish view will be invalidated if the pair turns around and breaks below $7,435.47.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has largely been range-bound between $200 and $250 for more than a month. The lone attempt to push the price above the range on April 6 turned around from $280.47 on April 08.BCH-USD daily chart. Source: TradingviewWhen the price consolidates for a long time, it usually culminates with a strong breakout. In this case, if the bulls can propel the price above $250, the BCH/USD pair is likely to pick up momentum and rally to $300.On the other hand, if the pair again turns down from $250, the range-bound action could extend for a few more days. The trend will turn negative on a break below $200 as it will complete a bearish head and shoulders pattern, which could result in a retest of the recent lows at $141.11.BCH-USD 4-hour chart. Source: TradingviewThough the pair is stuck in a trend, the traders can spot an ascending triangle pattern. This bullish setup will complete on a breakout and close (UTC time) above $250. Therefore, the traders can buy on a close above $250 and keep a stop loss at $225.The bulls might face a stiff resistance at $280.47, hence, the traders can tighten the stops closer to this level. However, if this level is crossed, the up move can reach $300 and then $320.If the price turns down from the current levels, the traders might get another buying opportunity near the trendline of the ascending channel. However, if the bears sink the price below the trendline, long positions can be avoided.Huobi Token (HT) has recovered sharply from its recent lows of $1.18361, which shows strong demand at lower levels. For the past few days, $4.05 has been acting as a stiff overhead resistance. HT-USD daily chart. Source: TradingviewHowever, both moving averages have been gradually moving higher and the RSI is in the positive territory, which suggests that bulls have the upper hand.The HT/USD pair has also formed a bullish ascending triangle pattern, which will complete on a breakout and close (UTC time) above $4.05. The pattern target of this setup is $4.58. If this level is crossed, the up move can extend to $4.80.Conversely, the failure to sustain the price above $4.05 will keep the pair inside the triangle for a few more days.HT-USD 4-hour chart. Source: TradingviewThe bulls broke above the overhead resistance of $4.05 today but they have not been able to sustain the breakout. This suggests selling at higher levels. However, the positive sign is that the bulls have not allowed the price to sink below the support at $3.90.This suggests demand at lower levels. The bulls are again likely to attempt a breakout above $4.05. If the pair can close (UTC time) above $4.05, the ascending triangle pattern will complete and a rally to $4.58 is possible.Therefore, traders can buy on a close (UTC time) above $4.05 and keep a stop loss of $3.80. The bears might attempt to stall the rally in the $4.15-$4.20 resistance zone. If the traders find that the bulls are struggling to push the price above this zone, the stops can be tightened to reduce the risk.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

SEN’s BTC transaction volume also increased 118%, with more than 31,000 transactions.As of April 2020, the bank is serving 850 digital currency-related clients including cryptocurrency exchanges and miners, custodians, and global investors.Though many holders saw negative returns from the crypto bloodbath, Silvergate reported “a fairly significant increase” in deposits of $447 million BTC following the March 12 downturn. Based on the firm’s performance for the rest of Q1, Silvergate believes it is “well-positioned” for the additional expansion of digital assets and potential volatility in the future.The bank said the volatility had been a good test for SEN — which was joined by both Kraken and the Winklevoss’ Gemini exchange last year. Still in the pilot stage, the exchange offers leveraged trading to select institutional customers using BTC: “One of the things that we were eager to test in the pilot was the mechanism by which we are—we monitor the price of the bitcoin collateral, and then also make the ""margin calls"" or our—whether our customers are covering collateral shortfalls and/or whether we have to liquidate bitcoin collateral. In order to really test that, you need to see some volatility in the asset class... we saw quite a bit of volatility during the first quarter, and I'm happy to say that our monitoring worked well”Through this program, Silvergate approved $12.5 million in BTC collateralized loans for Q1."

Changing",https://cointelegraph.com/news/institutional-investment-builds-in-q1-2020-crypto-funds-see-increase-in-holdings,"As Grayscale reveals it holds 1.7% of all Bitcoin in circulation, 
institutional investors seem to be gaining more confidence in Bitcoin. 5494 
Total ...",,"A recent report by Grayscale, the world's largest digital currency asset manager, revealed the firm now holds roughly 1.7% of all of Bitcoin’s supply in its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). Having seen the biggest quarter yet, Grayscale’s share of Bitcoin increased by 0.1% in 2020 despite current market uncertainties brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic.","Rayhaneh Sharif-Askary, Grayscale’s head of investor relations, told Cointelegraph that “the majority of capital invested into our products comes from institutional investors.” He elaborated:“We saw 88% of the $503.7M in capital invested into our family of products come from institutional investors this past quarter. Our recent conversations with investors reinforce the idea that now, more than ever, investors are going to be looking for ways to build resilient portfolios. Moreover, the implications of the current, unprecedented monetary policy are causing previously skeptical investors to take another hard look at the asset class.”While the Bitcoin Trust is the most popular among the company’s family of products, the increased inflow was experienced across the board, with Bitcoin (BTC) and all other altcoin-based trusts seeing around half a billion dollars in investment — double that of Q3 and Q4 2019. In Q1 2020, approximately 38% of Grayscale’s investors entered multiple Grayscale products in order to diversify their crypto holdings.The Grayscale Bitcoin trust received around $389 million in investment throughout the quarter, which means that if GBTC was an exchange-traded fund, it would be among the 5% of year-to-date inflows. Moreover, GBTC is also one of most-traded OTC securities and has received the title of one of the most active securities in terms of trading volume in 2019, which further signals demand among institutional investors and traders.While GBTC also targets retail investors, institutional players make up the overwhelming majority of capital inflow. Institutional investors represented 88% of the investment capital generated in the first quarter of 2020, most of which are hedge funds.Grayscale was the first regulated crypto product to hit the market, having been launched in 2013. Since then, the company has expanded into a number of altcoin-based funds. However, the supply of options for institutional exposure has continued to grow, especially over the last couple of years.Exchange-traded products like the physically-backed Bitcoin ETPs from Amun AG and from WisdomTree — both of which are currently trading in the Switzerland SIX stock exchange — are an example of readily available exposure for institutional players.Most recently, 3iQ has announced the launch of its Bitcoin close-end fund on the Toronto Stock Exchange, which leverages price indexes by CryptoCompare and VanEck Europe subsidiary MVIS and custody services by Gemini. Cameron Winklevoss, Gemini’s president, recently told Cointelegraph: “This mirrors the growing appetite that institutional and retail investors alike are demonstrating for incorporating crypto assets into their larger portfolios.”Exposure to derivative products has also become widely available for institutional investors in the last month through the Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s Bitcoin futures and options contracts as well as Bakkt’s physically-settled Bitcoin futures and LedgerX’s regulated derivatives products.It’s important to note that the interest and volume on these paper markets is miniscule when compared to unregulated activity. According to Jonathan Hobbs — chartered financial analyst, author of The Crypto Portfolio and the chief operating officer at Ecstatus Capital — institutional demand is already here, but the challenge is finding compliant products that can satisfy their standards. Hobbs told Cointelegraph:“As time goes by more traditional hedge funds, fund of funds and family offices are starting to see that Bitcoin and digital assets can offer them diversification. The main challenges for them lie in having digital investment products that will pass their compliance checks. Over the last few years we have seen the digital space mature considerably, with several infrastructure improvements that are making Bitcoin more accommodating to professional investors.”Grayscale’s results are impressive and show that institutional investors are looking to gain exposure to Bitcoin and other digital assets even during the current climate, where uncertainty and fear are becoming the norm. However, given the current state of affairs, Bitcoin is left for those with a higher risk appetite. Matt D’Souza, CEO of Blockware Solutions and digital currency hedge fund manager, told Cointelegraph, “Markets turn on a dime. If you’re not in when the opportunity presents, you’re too late.” He then added:“While some institutional investors may be looking to bet on Bitcoin on the basis it could theoretically do well in a crisis, managers for the most part want cash which is by far the safest option. Managers that have been around for a long time understand how to last. It’s because their investors are in the stay rich business, not the get rich. This environment warrants capital preservation. As risk appetite comes back into the market I expect Bitcoin to be one of the best opportunities.”In fact, while compliant offers for BTC are on the rise, data shows that, as of late, regulated derivatives have been losing ground both in terms of volume and open interest in contracts. This trend is observed only in regulated markets, while unregulated derivatives products had their biggest month yet in March in terms of trading volume.This may suggest that institutional investors who are betting on Bitcoin are doing so as part of a longer-term strategy, given the increased interest in passive products like GBTC but decreased interest for CME’s futures and options.This trend may soon pivot as large players enter the field. For example, Renaissance Technologies’ Medallion Fund — a hedge fund with $10 billion worth of assets under management — has recently received approval from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission to offer products and services involving the CME-regulated Bitcoin futures market to its clients.While institutional interest and offerings both seem to be on the rise, there is still a lot of uncertainty when it comes to Bitcoin. There are many aspects in play, from the technology to monetary policy (especially with the upcoming halving), and most importantly, regulation. Bitcoin is still threading uncharted territory when it comes to compliance, and research shows that news involving clear regulatory updates increase demand for Bitcoin.Grayscale Bitcoin Trust has become an SEC-reporting security, which shows that regulators are willing to work with companies in the industry. According to Sharif-Askary, this type of collaboration is helping drive the industry forward. Sharif-Askary told Cointelegraph that regulators seem “eager to engage, especially from an educational perspective.” He went on to add that Grayscale Bitcoin Trust becoming regulated by the SEC is a vital step:“This means that the Trust is held to the same reporting and disclosure standards as stocks and ETFs that trade on national exchanges such as NYSE and Nasdaq. It also reinforces that there are ways to proactively work with regulators, within the existing regulatory frameworks.”While the long-awaited Bitcoin exchange-traded fund is still nowhere to be seen, it seems that institutional demand is already here. While the cryptocurrency industry still needs to make adjustments to ensure more transparency and compliance, it seems that the right steps are being taken. In the meantime, regulated alternatives to the Bitcoin ETF continue to increase.Related: The SEC Does Not Want Crypto ETFs — What Will It Take to Get Approval?The latest attempt at a Bitcoin-related ETF was made by Wilshire Phoenix. The proposal was rejected by the SEC, who cited lack of a surveillance-sharing agreement with a significant market for the underlying asset or a novel demonstration of the market’s inherent resistance to manipulation.Nevertheless, companies in the space are pushing toward a more transparent market. Crypto data forensics companies are working alongside service providers and regulators to create a more transparent market, which will play a big role in the approval of an ETF. However, according to Hobbs, this may not be as significant as the community thinks:“With crypto products such as the CME Bitcoin Futures, the Grayscale BTC Trust in the U.S. and the Wisdom Tree Bitcoin ETP, there are already options for institutions to get Bitcoin exposure without having to buy it directly. Also, not all institutional investors who want to go digital are looking for passive 'buy and hold' Bitcoin exposure, which is what you get with an ETF. Many of them are looking for regulated digital quant funds like Ecstatus Capital which can trade Bitcoin long and short.”Whether 2020 becomes the year of the Bitcoin ETF is unclear, but one thing is certain: Compliant options exist and are becoming increasingly available. With or without an ETF, regulation is the key to advancing the industry, and if the industry continues to mature, an ETF may be just another milestone on Bitcoin’s road to mass adoption."

For example an article in Bitcoinist yesterday about “Tether printer divergence” argued the fact that the BTC price is yet to go up following a large amount of Tether being printed could point towards a new bull run.The University of Texas research was used against Tether and iFinex in lawsuits around market manipulation. This latest research casts doubts on those claims, which Tether has described as “without merit or legal basis”."

Source: Coin360With Bitcoin halving less than nine days away, the big question troubling traders is whether the price will pump or dump following the event. Various comparisons and possibilities are being projected but in reality, no one knows with certainty how it will play out. Therefore, traders should be ready with their plan of action for both possibilities. The uncertainty can lead to high volatility, which can offer trading opportunities both on the long side and the short side of the market. Bitcoin (BTC) is in an uptrend. Both moving averages are sloping up and the relative strength index is in overbought territory, which suggests that bulls are in command.  BTC-USD daily chart.

If the bulls can propel the price above this resistance, the momentum is likely to pick up and a quick move to $10,000 is possible.Conversely, if the bulls fail to propel the price above $9,200, a drop to the 10-day exponential moving average ($8,320) is possible. If BTC bounces off this support, the possibility of a break above $9,200 increases as it will suggest that the bulls are not waiting for a deeper correction to buy.However, if the bears sink the price below the 10-day EMA, a drop to the breakout level of $8,175.49 is possible. A break below this level can drag the price to the 20-day simple moving average ($7,626). Such a move will suggest that the momentum has weakened.BTC-USD 4-hour chart. Source: TradingviewThe 4-hour chart shows the formation of a pennant. If the bears sink the price below the pennant, a drop to $8,175.49 and below it to $7,700 is possible. The intraday traders can attempt a short trade with a close stop-loss if the price sustains below the pennant for four hours. As this is a counter-trend trade, the risk is high, hence, a smaller position size can be used.Conversely, if the BTC/USD pair reverses direction from the current levels and breaks out of the pennant, the up move is likely to resume. The target objective of a break above the pennant is $10,900.However, the bears are unlikely to give up without a fight. They would attempt to stall the rally at $10,000 and again at $10,500. Therefore, the traders can watch these levels closely and book partial profits if they find that the price is turning around.After being an underperformer for a long time, Ethereum Classic (ETC), the 19th-ranked cryptocurrency on CoinMarketCap is trying to play catch up. The breakout above the overhead resistance of $7.04147 on May 2 is a positive sign. ETC-USD daily chart.

The target objective is a move to $8.65404 and then to $10. This bullish view will be invalidated if the bears sink and sustain the price below $7.04147.  ETC-USD 4-hour chart. Source: TradingviewThe 4-hour chart shows that the ETC/USD pair has been taking support at the 20-moving average during pullbacks. This shows that the trend remains up and the bulls are using the dips to buy.However, the bears are unlikely to give up easily. They are attempting to stall the up move closer to $7.60. Therefore, the price might consolidate near $7.05 levels for some time. Traders can wait for the pair to break above $7.63 before buying. The positions can be closed if the price sustains below the 20-MA.Aggressive traders can buy on dips to the 20-MA after the pair starts to resume the uptrend by forming a decisive bullish bar. The stop-loss can be kept just below the 20-MA.On the upside, traders can book partial profits in the $8.28-$8.65 zone if the bulls struggle to break above it. Tron (TRX) could be getting ready for a sharp up move within the next few days.

If the price closes (UTC time) above the range, it is likely to pick up momentum and rally towards $350.BCH-USD 4-hour chart. Source: Tradingview The 4-hour chart shows that the bears are aggressively defending the resistance of the range at $280. The BCH/USD pair is in the early stage of forming a possible descending triangle pattern that would complete on a breakdown and close (UTC time) below $250.This bearish pattern has a target objective of $224. Therefore, the traders can initiate short positions on a close (UTC time) below $250 and keep a stop loss just above the downtrend line. There is strong support at $236. If the bears struggle to break below this support, partial profits can be booked and the stops on the rest of the position can be trailed to breakeven. This short trade should be attempted only if the overall sentiment turns negative.Conversely, if the price rebounds off $250 and breaks above the downtrend line, the bulls will once again attempt to propel the price above the range. If successful, the uptrend is likely to pick up momentum. Therefore, if the sentiment remains bullish, the traders can wait for the price to close (UTC time) above $280 before initiating long positions. The first short-term target objective is $310 and above it $330.Stellar Lumens (XLM) has again found a place in our list as it is an outperformer and is in a strong uptrend.

If the price breaks below $0.071, a drop to the 10-day EMA ($0.068) is possible. A bounce off the 10-day EMA can offer a buying opportunity with a close stop loss. On the upside, the target is $0.08 and above it $0.088777.  Conversely, if the bears sink the price below the 10-day EMA, a deeper pullback to the 20-day SMA ($0.059) is possible. XLM-USD 4-hour chart. Source: TradingviewThe 4-hour chart shows that the RSI is forming a bearish divergence, which suggests that the XLM/USD pair is losing momentum. If the bears sink the pair below the uptrend line, a drop to $0.0673 is possible.

The advisors that work for the Wealth Management divisions have a HARD NO Bitcoin policy.”JPMorgan’s public relationship with cryptocurrencies have been complex. The bank’s CEO Jamie Dimon is a renowned Bitcoin naysayer who went from saying that he “doesn’t really give a shit about Bitcoin” to launching JPM Coin, a stablecoins-inspired digital asset. Goldman Sachs has entered the industry a while ago, having invested in a number of key projects like payments application Circle and cloud-based supply chain company Tradeshift. When asked whether he managed to pursue his client to get into Bitcoin after all, Pokornicky replied: “No not yet.

The undergraduate student at the The University of Skövde in Sweden asked 339 people five questions related to Bitcoin (BTC) security, focusing on how crypto holders handle their private keys.When participants were asked where they stored the majority of their BTC, nearly half — 158 people — said they used a hardware wallet such as those offered by Ledger, TREZOR and BitLox. Hardware wallets can store both a user’s crypto wallet and private keys.Source: RedditCybersecurity was also a topic under discussion in  Lindqvist’s thesis. Roughly 88% of those surveyed said they kept backups of their keys, with the majority —  238 people — admitting their backup was on a scrap of paper.Source: RedditSource: RedditSpeaking to Cointelegraph, Lindqvist thinks hardware wallets are the most popular options among BTC holders because they offer “availability, security and user-friendly interface.” But what method does the student use himself?“I'm using a hardware wallet and I use a piece of paper where I have written down my backup. But I'm considering [a] metal plate now after the survey.”The crypto community is long past the days when users had few choices but to write down their keys in capital letters on a notepad. Prominent figures like Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao have suggested that exchanges are better for holding crypto than users retaining the keys themselves. According to this survey, it seems that an old school method of security may be the preferred one. This could be in response to exchanges being hacked, but users physically storing keys comes with its own risks. Thousands of BTC have been lost from holders misplacing or destroying equipment containing private keys over the years, amounting to billions of dollars vanished into the ether. However, even when keys are held securely, backed up, and still “lost”, there can be hope. A software engineer was able to recover nearly $300,000 in Bitcoin for a Russian who lost the password to a zip file containing his private keys."

Stornetta shared some possible insights into the creator's background.",,"Blockchain co-inventor, Scott Stornetta, profiles Satoshi Nakamoto for Cointelegraph.","In a recent Cointelegraph interview, Stornetta explained why he could not have been Satoshi Nakamoto, or part of Bitcoin’s creation. He also ruled out Craig Wright as a possible candidate. Although he may not know the true identity of Bitcoin (BTC)’s founder, Stornetta shared some possible insights into the creator’s background.Stornetta tends to believe that Satoshi was rather an individual than a team. He discounts the argument that in order to create Bitcoin, one would have needed to be knowledgeable in too many disciplines — being a cypherpunk would have been enough, Stornetta contends:“And some of the arguments for the team are, gee, this guy was somebody that knew crypto, but he also knew programming and he also knew economics and math, monetary policy and so forth. But quite frankly, to me, he reads like someone who was a software engineer, who followed the cypherpunks mailing list. And I think that alone is enough to justify his level of understanding about cryptography and economics.”Stornetta, himself, was on the cypherpunk mailing list in the early days, but had left prior to the release of Bitcoin. The genius of Satoshi does not lie in any particular discipline, but is rather of the eclectic nature — the ability to arrange disparate pieces into a beautiful mosaic.He is also of the opinion that despite the founder’s Japanese name, Satoshi, likely was a Westerner residing in the eastern United States. He is basing the latter assumption on the timestamps of Satoshi’s emails.Stornetta might have crossed paths with Satoshi at one of the many cryptographic conferences that were taking place at the University of California Santa Barbara. The ideas about cryptography, software development, economic incentives that Satoshi absorbed in Bitcoin were percolating at those gatherings. Furthermore, Stornetta says that the evidence points to Satoshi not being a trained cryptologist. Although he believes the work that Satoshi did to be a work of genius, the technical expertise required for building Bitcoin, would suggest that a few hundred individuals could have done it:“And what I'm getting at is all of those kinds of things that he talks about were sort of in the air amongst cryptographers. For example, all of the economic impact things, that would be a typical conversation that people in this community would have. And so I think there's a few hundred people that could have filled the role. There is some evidence that this person was not really trained as a cryptologist. And I think there's evidence of that in the way the implementation is done.”Both Stornetta and Satoshi have apparently spent a lot of time and effort on solving one of the crucial problems of a decentralized system — how to instill consensus into a network made up of participants with misaligned incentives:“I was impressed with Satoshi that he also grasped how crucial it was to solve the incentive problem among the participants, that's the kind of thing that made him feel like, you know, we could have been peers, like he wrestled with the same issues that we wrestled with.”Stornetta admits that Satoshi’s solution — the introduction of mining and block rewards — is not something that he ever considered. The fact that the “mining idea” Satoshi borrowed from Adam Back’s Hashcash only underscores the eclectic nature of Satoshi’s genius.In an upcoming story, we will reveal the different paths to decentralization, the two pioneers took."
82,https://cointelegraph.com,,On the Darknet Side: The Role of Crypto as a Means of Exchange,https://cointelegraph.com/news/on-the-darknet-side-the-role-of-crypto-as-a-means-of-exchange,"Why is Bitcoin popular among cybercriminals, and what is the future of 
cryptocurrencies in the darknet? 10503 Total views. 113 Total shares.",,"Due to the transition of many people around the world into a “stay at home” mode, where the only viable way of communicating and receiving something is through the global network, some new information regarding darknet activity has begun to surface. ","In the time of COVID-19, there has been an increase in both the activity of cyber fraudsters using the capabilities of cryptocurrencies and general illegal activity on the World Wide Web.Of course, not all darknet operators are using the epidemic for malicious advantage, and comply with the code of honor. Nonetheless, Cointelegraph decided to figure out how Bitcoin is associated with the darknet, whether the global pandemic affects illegal crypto operations, and how authorities around the world are coping.Digital assets are used in many areas, including acting as a means of payment on the darknet by those seeking maximum anonymity while performing operations deemed questionable by regulators.Cryptocurrencies are especially popular with sellers of items like illegal drugs, weapons and other restricted goods. Darknet users provide impetus to markets in the network by using special software such as the TOR browser to circumvent inaccessibility to such goods through the use of crypto, with its pseudo-anonymity for transactions. These kinds of transactions and the concept of ​​decentralization itself has put limitations on the control of global intelligence agencies.Sellers of illegal goods latched on to the decentralized principle of cryptocurrencies early on, using them long before Bitcoin (BTC) became a household name. A striking case is the online market Silk Road, launched as part of the darknet. It relied heavily on Bitcoin while the token was still a mystery to many back in 2011. On the darknet, all connections are established between trusted nodes through special protocols and ports. All IP addresses are hidden, so it’s not possible to enter the darknet through familiar browsers such as Chrome, Firefox or Safari. The entire network operates on the principle of decentralization and is not controlled by any authority. Due to this, users receive some degree of security, since many sites in the darknet use TOR encryption protocols, which hide the identities of users and replace their IP addresses.There are many sites selling illicit goods on the darknet, among which AlphaBay and Oasis stand out. They have arguably caused the price of privacy-oriented cryptocurrency Monero (XMR) to skyrocket in the past after adding the token as a payment option. Anonymous token transactions have allowed the dark network to progress, but this has, in turn, developed a connection between cryptocurrencies and illegal activity in the minds of many people today.Aleksandr Lazarenko, the head of the R&D department at Group-IB — one of the biggest providers of solutions aimed at detecting and preventing cyber attacks — shared his opinion with Cointelegraph on why cryptocurrencies are popular among criminals:“Despite the fact that transactions carried out in Bitcoin are noted for their transparency, they still grant cybercriminals with considerable anonymity. Since cryptocurrencies are normally decentralized and do not belong to some particular national jurisdiction, operations with their use are not that closely monitored by monetary authorities. Another obvious reason that explains cybercriminals’ passion for cryptocurrencies, is no need to disclose valid personal information for their holders.”There is still an opinion that BTC and other cryptocurrencies are used only for criminal purposes. However, offshore banking systems are more suitable for financing terrorist activities and money laundering than an anonymous decentralized network through which payments pass.Undoubtedly, BTC helped to run the darknet economy of Silk Road, but marketplaces on the darknet have begun to close up shop over the last few years — and for good reason. According to Chainalysis experts, darknet deals flourished in 2019, especially thanks to cryptocurrencies. However, these online assets are subject to sharp fluctuations in price, which affects their use on the darknet.Carles Lopez-Penalver, cybercrime analyst at Chainalysis, told Cointelegraph that sellers reduced their activity during periods of decline in the BTC price, fearing that the funds they accept may not be worth anything the next day:“While we think darknet markets are resilient and here to stay, it was interesting to observe that darknet market revenue fell much more than we expected following Bitcoin’s recent major price drop associated with COVID-19.”Nevertheless, experts agree that no matter what the price rate of a particular cryptocurrency is, they will still be popular on the darknet. Lazarenko opined:“Cryptocurrency is de facto the main currency of the underground, therefore, it will definitely be popular. The extent of its popularity and use will directly depend on the state of the underground market — if it grows, there are likely to be more transactions in cryptocurrencies. When it comes to the main payers on this market, there are few cryptocurrencies that can compare to Bitcoin in their popularity, perhaps, we’ll see the growth of Ethereum 2.0, once it sees the world, but it is still likely to be behind Bitcoin.” Despite the decline in cryptocurrency operations on the darknet, criminal activity seems to be moving to distributed platforms and encrypted applications, and this is where Telegram Open Network may come in.Many think that TON will be a new darknet, and here is why. The usual websites that users see when opening a link in a browser work on the basis of the Transmission Control Protocol, Internet Protocol and Hypertext Transfer Protocol. TCP is responsible for the reliable transfer of the byte stream from one computer to another, IP is for routing the dataset or determination of all data transfer points, and HTTP works one level higher, allowing for information to be encoded in the form of documents.Overlay networks such as TOR or a VPN can be created based on these protocols. Most of them are designed to eliminate privacy issues like low security and lack of anonymity. The Telegram team has proposed another one — TON Sites. Technically, the sites created on the TON network will look like regular web pages, but the difference is that content will not be stored on any server but rather distributed across network nodes and users. Instead of IP addresses on this network, there will be an Abstract Datagram Network Layer protocol providing encryption by default, while access to regular HTTP sites and vice versa will be possible through gateways.Not surprisingly, some analysts see TON sites as an element of a technologically advanced darknet platform, the core of which is the Gram cryptocurrency. Russian law enforcement authorities have thus voiced concerns about the platform, publishing a notice in March that called on contractors to investigate and block anonymous networks, including both TOR and TON as targets.Moreover, darknet platforms like TOR or potentially TON don’t solely utilize cryptocurrencies, but also blockchain technology as a whole. There are already a few projects that are actively using the blockchain in order to access their resources. Experts at Chainalysis confirmed:“There are some markets and fraud shops that have implemented blockchain technology beyond a mode of currency. Multiple carding shops and some small drug shops operate through Blockchain DNS, which uses Namecoin and Emercoin to protect marketplaces against ISP DNS blocking to make sure their customers are able to access their marketplace.”Regulators around the world are increasingly concerned about the role of cryptocurrencies in money laundering and the financing of various illegal activities. Since the beginning of 2020, many governments have begun to actively combat this situation, and have introduced various legal measures designed to strengthen their protection against financial cybercrime.According to Chainalysis, the number of darknet users directly relates to how strict government policies are toward the internet. Therefore, the darknet is mainly used in the United States, Russia and some European countries such as Germany, the Netherlands and France.Echoing moves by Russia, where the central bank periodically introduces strict recommendations on how financial institutions should detect suspicious transactions including digital currency exchange, the U.S. law enforcement and regulatory agencies established a cryptocurrency intelligence program in March that proposed new rules and tax reporting requirements to help pave the way for the widespread adoption of blockchain technology.At the end of March, the International Criminal Police Organization announced a partnership with South Korean data intelligence startup S2W Lab to analyze darknet activity, including cryptocurrency transactions. However, it is not yet clear how effective their measures will be, as users on the dark side of the net tend to find new ways of continuing their illegal activities one way or another."

Novogratz, who is confident that Bitcoin will hit $20,000 by the end of 2020, argues that Telegram should integrate Bitcoin and stablecoins instead of creating the TON and its native token, Gram (GRM).He wrote:“Telegram should enable btc and stable coins on their platform. We don’t need another blockchain. We don’t need another crypto. They have an awesome community of messaging users.

According to the firm, at least 1.5 million new users sign up for Telegram per day.However, instead of introducing popular cryptos like Bitcoin, Telegram chose to work on its own cryptocurrency and blockchain. Telegram’s TON network and Gram token have been in development since 2017. Telegram’s crypto initiative subsequently raised about $1.7 billion in two private initial coin offerings in 2018.Telegram was originally planning to launch the TON network in October 2019. However, the initiative has still not launched. Telegram has been in legal battle with the United States’ Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) since the conclusion of their coin offering.

This is something which many critics point to as proof of a pre-mine and centralized control, but the research suggests otherwise.While roughly 17% of Ether (16.6 million ETH) is held by just 10 addresses, and the top 10,000 addresses hold around 94% of the available tokens, this is skewed by the fact that much of the currency is used and held in smart contracts.Removing these from the equation shows that the top 10,000 Ethereum addresses actually hold around 56.7% of ETH; comparable to the 57.44% of Bitcoin (BTC) held by the top 10,000 wallet addresses.In contrast, 16 addresses hold over 50% of XRP, 300 hold over 50% of Litecoin (LTC), and just over 1,000 addresses hold over 50% of Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Bitcoin SV (BSV) and Tron (TRX):""This means when it comes to equity of distribution, Ethereum and Bitcoin are in a league of their own... No other coin comes within an order of magnitude of their distribution.""In addition, ETH is used 440 times more than Bitcoin for transacting. 16.2 million ETH has passed through a payment processor, gateway or smart contract in the last 90 days. Only 0.36% of Bitcoin has been through a payment processor in the past two years.Another finding is that whales have been accumulating in the down market and they have not been alone. Existing whales have increased their ETH position by more than 4%, injecting $550 million into the market in the last six months.Bitcoin, in comparison, has seen $600 million in capital influx over the past 12 months and across all accounts, not just whales.There has also been an influx of new ETH whales, with a significant number of new wallets in the top 10,000 coming from fiat on-ramp exchanges serving large scale customers.A subsection of miners have also started to aggressively hoard Ether, potentially in readiness to convert mining operations into staking operations.What’s more, the Ethereum founders, genesis buyers and even Vitalik Buterin himself, still own a large proportion of their initial holdings. 97.4% of the genesis buyers in the top 10,000 list who claimed their wallets, still hold over 75% of their initial ETH purchase.A deeper look into staking, predicted a 17–20% yield for early phase 0 adopters, dropping in stages before finally leveling out at 4–6% once ETH 2.0 is fully rolled out and transactable.Investors can also take heart, as Cochran predicts healthy initial returns once Ether transitions to Proof-of-Stake:“ETH 2.0 will likely initially return 12–17% to start.”"

One of them is a general book on probability, the rest are foundational to the cryptocurrency space. Three of those works were co-authored by Stornetta. In a 1991 paper, “How to time-stamp a digital document”, Stornetta and his longtime partner Stuart Haber proposed a decentralized scheme that would allow to certify when a file was created or changed:“We propose computationally practical procedures for digital time-stamping of such documents so that it is infeasible for a user either to back-date or to forward-date his document.”For blockchain history buffs — the paper references work by the future Turing award recipient and Algorand (ALGO) founder Silvio Micali. Many of the principles proposed in this and subsequent papers were later used by Satoshi Nakamoto. However, long before Bitcoin, Huber and Stornetta started their own blockchain network that is considered to be the first of its kind and is still running till this day.As a recent convert to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Stornetta went as a missionary to Japan, which allowed him to become fluent in Japanese and later afforded him a job as a patent translator.Discussing possible interpretations of the name “Satoshi Nakamoto,” Stornetta said:“You can buy an entire dictionary that is just about a Japanese name. And so Satoshi could have 20 different kanji that back it up. But I am just naturally inclined to think that ‘satoru’ is a Japanese word ‘to know,’ ‘to be wise’.”On the other hand, the last name “Nakamoto” is a very common Japanese name, just “like Smith or Johnson.” However, if one was to break it down into kanjis, then one possible interpretation would be:“‘Naka,’ just obviously means the center of, ‘moto’ is the origin of.”Similar interpretations gave rise to a conspirological idea that Bitcoin was created by the Central Intelligence Agency.Although his work and Japanese fluency make Stornetta a perfect Satoshi candidate, he has always unequivocally denied it. Furthermore, he put forward an ideological argument as to why he is not Satoshi:“And so a good deal of our focus went into the ability to perpetually renew the integrity of the record over time so that the records will last for decades if not centuries, and we'll survive quantum resistant computing and all of those things. And that's something that Satoshi gave no attention to whatsoever.”Although he says that he does not know the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto, he ruled out Craig Wright:“I do not think it's Craig Wright, let's put it that way.”Stornetta believes that we should try to understand Satoshi’s vision for Bitcoin in order to understand how to move forward. Also, he is of the opinion that Bitcoin is rather art, than science:“I am of the camp that believes that what was done with Bitcoin was surely a work of genius. But it's more like a work of art, a work of engineering art that opens the door to a number of possibilities but is in no sense the final or best solution that can be built.”Although Stornetta may not be Satoshi Nakamoto, his work was foundational to Bitcoin and the entire cryptocurrency field."

It is plain to see that the ...",,"Over the last decade, cryptocurrency mining has been given a bad rap for the sheer amount of electricity required to power the industry. Back in 2017, it was pointed out that the collective power consumption of the Bitcoin (BTC) mining network in particular eclipsed the power consumption of some countries around the world. This was echoed in another 2019 study that suggested Bitcoin mining produces more carbon pollution than some countries.","Toward the latter end of 2019, a couple of studies showed that the Bitcoin network was using less energy, despite increasing hash rates. This also included data that estimated that around 75% of Bitcoin mining was powered by renewable energy sources.It is plain to see that the debate around the inherent costs of Bitcoin mining and the impact it has on the environment will continue unabated. That fact has not been lost on a variety of industry players that are actively seeking alternatives to not only make mining more profitable but also less costly, both economically and environmentally.Earlier this month, Cointelegraph reported on a unique situation in which an oil company was converting excess gas being produced into electricity to power crypto mining rigs. The situation was necessitated by the sheer costs of converting or piping the gas to be sold on the open market. It was a unique example of how industries are having to adapt to specific problems and how cryptocurrency mining has provided an alternative way to not only make use of excess energy but make a profit from doing so.Conventional oil drilling and production has long been a proverbial gold mine that has played a massive role in powering industry and trade around the world. One endeavor has found Bitcoin mining as a more profitable way to make use of the excess gas from oil mining, as opposed to converting the gas to liquid form and selling it on conventional markets.Podcaster Marty Bent, who revealed the use case, went as far as envisioning oil and gas companies dominating the mining space in the future due to the abundance of excess gas from oil fields. By setting up mining operations in containers at the fields, there is no need to pipe or transport excess gas. The operations simply turn the surplus gas or oil into electricity to power the mining rigs.Cointelegraph spoke to Stephen Barbour, the president of Upstream Data, a company that builds and supplies the necessary equipment for oil and gas mining companies to make use of excess gas to mine cryptocurrencies. Having set up shop in 2017, Barbour said that there has since been a substantial spike in interest from various companies: “We started marketing in 2017 and had a difficult time getting taken seriously, now we are getting cold calls from the very same people that turned us away the first time.”Barbour also agreed with Bent's sentiments that oil and gas companies would gradually make up a bigger portion of the overall cryptocurrency mining ecosystem. A major driving force is the use of wasted energy sources that are abundant in the sector:“I've been saying for years that the oil and gas industry will dominate the Bitcoin network hashrate. Hydroelectric dams and utilities are built to serve residential and commercial businesses, not Bitcoin miners. Mining always seeks the most wasted energy sources, there is no greater energy waste than in the oil and gas industry.”Barbour also predicted that oil and gas producers that do not consider turning to Bitcoin mining will be at a disadvantage to competitors that do. The cost of building infrastructure to pipe or convert surplus gas simply does not have the same return on investment, while “shareholders tend to like when they increase reserves,” as he went on to explain further: “Mining eliminates the need for pipelines and wasted gas in many applications, there are no sunk costs unlike the pipe that is never recovered from the dirt. Producers not only earn money mining Bitcoin, they get to save money from being wasted paying for gas disposal or uneconomic pipeline projects. If their well production declines they can simply redeploy their data centers elsewhere. It is a no brainer.”Another consideration is the reduction in carbon emissions, according to Barbour. He believes that Bitcoin mining in particular gets a bad rap for its perceived environmental impact, and he highlighted the importance of making use of wasted energy, saying that a small V-8 50-kilowatt hash generator “reduces carbon emissions by up to 10,000 tonnes / year when deployed on vented gas sources.”Renewable and green energy sources are another major consideration going forward and have been a focal point in Bitcoin mining circles. The simple question is whether it is more profitable for electricity produced from solar farms to be sold to power grids or used to power mining.Cointelegraph reached out to Christian Ander, the founder of the Stockholm-based exchange BTCX, who came to this realization in 2018. As Ander explains, cryptocurrency mining has become a viable revenue stream for green energy producers as an alternative to connecting or contributing to mainstream power grids. Ander went on to explain that there are multiple benefits of generating and using solar power for mining operations and it would become the norm in the future:“I installed my panels during 2018. The profits had been two fold. Using energy from my panels I save 75% of the energy cost. But also when the energy price is low which it has been during 2020, currently I get 1,300% more by mining Bitcoin than selling the energy to the grid. I believe energy producers will wake up to this fact.”There is, of course, a certain barrier to entry, considering the initial cost of buying solar panels and mining equipment. However, the amount of money saved by buying electricity from the grid is the mitigating factor: “You basically prepay for 20–30 years of energy production up front. Of course it's about 75% cheaper than buying it from the grid.” For Ander, cost reduction is the primary reason for turning to solar power for his mining endeavors. However, there is added sentiment given the fact that a green energy solution is being used.Hydroelectric power has been a big mover in the world of Bitcoin mining, especially in China and Canada, which have both been able to offer preferable electricity rates to industries nearby certain hydroelectric dams. According to CoinShares’s most recent report on the global mining ecosystem, which was released at the end of 2019, 73% of the world’s Bitcoin mining operations run off renewable energy systems. Furthermore, the report estimates that miners are still mainly based in regions using cheap hydroelectric power.The report directly contradicts various media articles over the years regarding the effects that cryptocurrency mining has on the environment and suggests that the majority of mining operators are utilizing green energy. Furthermore, the use of some of these resources from the mining sector directly provides a solution to surplus or wasted energy that is created by hydroelectric power plants.Christopher Bendiksen, the head of research at CoinShares, spoke to Cointelegraph about the overarching trends in the cryptocurrency mining space. First and foremost, Bendiksen highlights the ruthless nature of the ecosystem and the focus on profits over moral considerations around green energy sources: “Miners need to first and foremost survive in a highly competitive industry so they search out the cheapest energy. It just so happens that the cheapest energy on the planet is renewables.” Hydroelectric energy producers and gas and oil companies seem to be the most favorable energy sources for the mining space. It is a point that is backed up by Bendiksen as well:“Hydro power is and will probably remain the most cost effective energy source for Bitcoin mining for the foreseeable future. Another potentially great source is waste natural gas. I do anticipate a move towards fossil fuels, specifically natural gas (we’re also observing increased coal use in Kazakhstan), as oil and gas producers realise it is more economical to mine Bitcoin with their waste gas instead of flaring it, or worse, venting it into the atmosphere, as are the current practices.”A key takeaway from conversations with various experts and industry participants seems to point toward hydroelectric and oil producers as major electricity sources for cryptocurrency mining operations. The latter is a sector that Bendiksen believes could well become far more prevalent and profitable:“The economical and environmental savings will just be too good to ignore. I’m maybe not quite as bullish on natural gas mining [...], but I do think it will be a big deal and certainly bigger than now.”Mining operations powered by solar panels are relatively small compared to the various energy sources used by the mining ecosystem. Bendiksen described solar-powered operations as a small percentage accounting for a few dozen megawatts and said that these operations were rare. Hydroelectric energy producers seem to be the proverbial lifeblood of the cryptocurrency mining industry. Looking ahead to the next five years, Bendiksen predicted that this would remain the status quo:“Yes this is still the case and I would be very surprised if it didn’t remain so for the next five years. The only potential source I can imagine overtaking hydro is natural gas, but it has a very, very long way to go considering how dominant hydro power is in the current energy mix.”Alejandro De La Torre, the vice president of the mining pool Poolin, believes that cheaper electricity prices produced by hydroelectric power plants will continue to be an attractive option for miners. As a result, the entire industry could become more efficient:“The industry will be much more professional too. There will be new entrants after the halving because of the new miners, new financing options, better operating systems for mining rigs and the clear 4 year Bitcoin reward scheme. The pursuit of cheaper electricity will undoubtedly continue and if the trend is to continue, most of this cheap power will come from green sources.”Nevertheless, profitability will always be a major consideration for cryptocurrency miners. With this in mind, De La Torre believes a push from the international community for more green energy production could ultimately dictate which energy sources are favored by mining operations:“As long as the cheaper electricity to be found is from green sources than most miners will choose it. The global trend of less fossil fuels will also help the mining industry as governments will push for more green power plants at even better prices. Ultimately, it is an effort from us all, if we push the global community to less fossil fuels than everyone wins.”"

cryptocurrencies ...",,"The first blockchain was launched more than 10 years ago and since then, it has evolved from simply being a backbone for Bitcoin (BTC) to a global technological phenomenon. In some sense, the distributed ledger became more popular than Bitcoin itself. Even the harshest cryptocurrency critics — like the government of China and JPMorgan Chase’s Jamie Dimon — recognize blockchain technology’s potential, while corporations as large as Microsoft and Accenture have adopted it to their needs.","However, there is another view of blockchain technology. One that is based on the assumption that the technology has stalled in certain areas it has been trying to disrupt — privacy being one of those fields.In mainstream culture, Bitcoin is still viewed as a digital currency that allows users to stay fully under the radar. In reality, most cryptocurrencies based on public blockchains merely offer pseudonymity. Meanwhile, tracking cryptocurrency transactions is only getting easier for law enforcement agents. Therefore, how much privacy does blockchain really offer?Back in 2012, at the dawn of blockchain and crypto, an internal FBI report leaked a warning to security service employees that Bitcoin provides a tool “to generate, transfer, launder and steal illicit funds with some anonymity.” The word “some” is key here, because according to the original white paper, “the risk is that if the owner of a key is revealed, linking could reveal other transactions that belonged to the same owner.” Therefore, Bitcoin, as well many other cryptocurrencies based on public blockchains, are pseudonymous and not fully anonymous — meaning that there is only a limited amount of privacy they can provide. Indeed, as time went by, authorities started successfully tracking down criminals who used Bitcoin to cover their tracks. One of the most high-profile cases in that regard was the arrest of Ross Ulbricht, an American national who operated the renowned deep web marketplace “Silk Road.” As told by a former FBI special agent, Ilhwan Yum, in court during the trial, he managed to track more than 700,000 BTC from Silk Road to what appeared to be Ulbricht’s personal wallets. Suddenly, buying things with Bitcoin on the dark web was no longer seen as foolproof.But that’s what bad guys get, one might argue, and law-abiding citizens have nothing to be afraid of. That’s not likely to be the case, as average cryptocurrency users could also be of interest to authorities. In 2018, top American exchange Coinbase informed approximately 13,000 of its customers that it was handing over their private information to the United States at the demand of the IRS. That data included social security numbers, names, birth dates, addresses and transaction records from 2013–2015. In 2018, researchers from Qatar published a paper showing how easy it is to identify sloppy users through their years-old Bitcoin transactions — even for people who don’t work in the intelligence services. Upon collecting thousands of visible Bitcoin wallet addresses and searching for direct links between them and Tor-sensitive hidden services like Silk Road and The Pirate Bay, they were able to find 125 unique users along with their public accounts.“Public blockchains were not created for privacy,” Pavlo Radchuk, the blockchain security lead at Hacken, a self-described “ecosystem of white-hat hackers,” told Cointelegraph, explaining that an active Bitcoin or Ethereum user can be tracked in different ways like if “an account bought something on a website [with crypto]. Now, this website has this account’s related IP address; delivery physical address, receiver name, etc.”Pseudonymity “is clearly not enough” when it comes to protecting one’s identity, Ghassan Karame, the manager and chief researcher at Security Group of NEC Laboratories Europe, confirmed in a conversation with Cointelegraph, elaborating:“The main issue with pseudonymity is that it does not hide the user profile including: transaction amounts, expenditure habits, time of payments, etc. Pseudonymity also does not attempt to hide the binding between the user profile and the user’s IP. All these issues make it relatively straightforward to deanonymize users in systems that rely on simple pseudonymity.”Hartej Sawhney, the CEO and co-founder of cybersecurity agency Zokyo Labs, painted an even grimmer picture where knowing the victim’s address is enough for the attacker to use physical force and get what they’re after: “A thief with some effort can trace an IP address, show up at your house and apply rubber hose cryptography to get your keys.”“We don’t believe that blockchain has the privacy benefits that I think some of its supporters first hoped,” Catherine Tucker, a professor of management at MIT Sloan and a co-founder of the Cryptoeconomics lab, told Cointelegraph, referring to the 2018 paper she co-authored with Susan Athey, a professor of economics at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, and Christian Catalini, a fellow MIT professor, who also works at Facebook’s Calibra.Blockchain technology’s trademark immutability has large privacy consequences, Tucker added. She argued that sensitive information — like health care records — is not necessarily fit to be stored on a blockchain, contrary to what a number of industry startups are trying to achieve:“Ultimately, when it comes to the privacy of data, I worry most about the kind of data that if it is public, has persistent consequences for me economically — such as my genome, my underlying health factors — things that I can’t change. I don’t worry about data that tells an advertiser I want a particular pair of shoes on a day — that is temporary data, which may change tomorrow, and is unlikely to have persistent consequences. And the danger of blockchain is we may be creating immutable data that we have no idea what the consequences of it will be for an individual 10 years in the future.”But what about permissioned blockchains — the ones that grant access only to relevant parties and market participants? “I’m not sure if there’s much difference between a permissioned blockchain and a shared database,” Harry Halpin, the CEO of privacy mixnet NYM Technologies, told Cointelegraph, adding that it “all depends on who has access or who is in your federation.” Karame went further, explaining that permissioned blockchains mostly rely on Crash fault tolerant or Byzantine fault tolerant — which have been studied better than proof-of-work and proof-of-stake — adding:“As the name indicates, CFT only tolerates crashes and does not provide any security against misbehavior otherwise. BFT systems, on the other hand, provide full tolerance to Byzantine behavior. Both CFT and BFT offer final consensus. This means that the confirmation output of such systems is final; most permissionless blockchains only offer eventual consensus guarantees, meaning that one’s transaction could be dismissed later in time — e.g., in case a block fork happens.”While blockchain technology has been deemed hack-proof (in the sense that it has yet to be compromised on a systematic level), the crypto industry is basically a land mine when it comes to security breaches. Over $292 million and over 500,000 pieces of customer data were stolen from cryptocurrency exchanges in 2019 alone (it was the biggest year for cryptocurrency hacks so far, although the amount of stolen funds was much smaller compared to previous years).Related: Crypto Exchange Hacks in ReviewIf blockchain technology is so secure, why are industry actors getting hacked? There’s a variety of different techniques that attackers use, although most of the aforementioned breaches involved social engineering — i.e., some participation on behalf of the victim, like opening an infected email, using public Wi-Fi to log into cryptocurrency wallets, installing malicious apps, etc. There are also more niche methods like clipboard hijacking, cryptojacking and bug exploiting — but in most cases, hackers target people or company servers, and not blockchains.Immutability doesn’t mean that blockchain technology cannot offer additional privacy, however. There are several privacy-oriented services, with Monero (XMR) and Zcash (ZEC) being the most popular examples. Both of them aim to protect the privacy of users by hiding transactions and their receivers through different methods. However, although privacy coins do offer a “decent level of privacy,” they still don’t make their users absolutely anonymous and leave some trail behind, said Karame:“Such systems are geared to provide sender anonymity, recipient anonymity, unlinkability of transactions, and hide as well the payment amount. They do not offer ‘absolute privacy’ though in the sense that the time that transactions are made is still publicly available. Such timing information could leak information about the geographic location of users.”Normally, there are ways to trace even anonymity-focused technologies, as Jonathan Levin, a co-founder and the CSO of blockchain and crypto analytics firm Chainalysis — one of the primary sources of crypto transaction data for U.S. agencies — affirmed in an email exchange with Cointelegraph: “While not impossible, anonymity is very difficult to achieve due to humans needing to implement and use them.”Moreover, regulators are overall not impressed with privacy coins and the anonymity they provide. Some jurisdictions, like South Korea and Poland, have gone as far as to force local exchanges to delist them, citing guidelines set out by the Financial Action Task Force. That drives those coins even deeper underground, applying additional stigma. Furthermore, as Halpin noted in a conversation with Cointelegraph, private blockchains such as Zcash and Monero “have all had critical bugs within the last year,” meaning that there is still a risk of getting exposed.It’s not just niche blockchain products whose privacy-enabling features are being scrutinized by regulations, added Nir Kshetri, a University of North Carolina-Greensboro professor who studied blockchain’s roles in strengthening cybersecurity and protecting privacy. In fact, the Chinese government has already introduced regulations in that area in February 2019. Kshetri told Cointelegraph:“The regulation requires users to provide real names, as well as national ID card numbers, mobile phones or company registration to use blockchain services. User anonymity is thus not allowed. Blockchain services are required to remove ‘illegal information’ quickly in order to stop it from spreading among users. Providers of blockchain services are also required to retain backups of user data for six months. Moreover, law enforcement must be able to get access to data whenever it is necessary.”The European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation law that attempts to supervise blockchain data is another concern for blockchain technology’s privacy, Kshetri continued: “The GDPR assumes that there is a data controller. Data subjects enforce their data protection rights against the controller. Blockchain’s decentralization feature means that there is no single center of control.” Moreover, regulations are unclear on how blockchain’s data controller is determined so it’s unclear who’s legally accountable if personal data is abused. Kshetri concluded that immutability is also a cause for concern:“When a block is added, it is extremely difficult or even impossible to delete or modify data in the block. The difficulties of deleting blockchain data violates data minimization and purpose limitation provisions of the GDPR. The idea here is that personal data should not be held longer than needed to achieve the purpose for which the data is collected.”Nearly 10 years in, privacy remains a controversial topic for blockchain technology. Still, there has been “lots of progress” on this front, says Karame of NEC Laboratories Europe: “Privacy has been increased in most blockchains — both permissionless and permissioned — over time, and this also includes the privacy of lightweight clients that connect to these platforms as well.”Indeed, anonymity-focused coins like Zcash, Dash (DASH) and Monero didn’t emerge until the mid-2010s, introducing a whole new level of privacy for cryptocurrency users. There are also cryptocurrency mixing services that picked up pace last year (they cloak the user’s info by creating temporary wallet addresses), although some governments are already onto them as well.Besides, how anonymous can one really get in the digital age where data is the main currency? “Complete transparency is not necessarily an ideal place,” as Levin previously told Cointelegraph, because privacy can empower bad actors to facilitate illicit behavior like money laundering and illegal trading. Indeed, despite some privacy-related problems, blockchain remains an innovative technology with much greater yet fewer controversial use cases."

Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.” The anonymous author of the ...",,"An anonymous post on the Cypherpunks mailing list from 21 years ago discusses the idea of “ecash,” and the speculation in the crypto community is that it might belong to a pre-Bitcoin Satoshi Nakamoto.","“Cypherpunk” refers to a movement that emerged in the 1980s advocating cryptography and other privacy-enhancing technologies as tools for promoting social change. Many of the early Bitcoin supporters were part of the Cypherpunks mailing list, including Adam Back, Hal Finney, and Nick Szabo. We do not know with any certainty whether Satoshi Nakamoto was ever part of the forum, but he surely would have been familiar with the ideas percolating there. Many of those ideas formed the basis for what Nakamoto ultimately finalized in Bitcoin.When this old post discussing “ecash” resurfaced, it was easy to connect the dots to present-day Bitcoin. Recall that the full name of the Bitcoin whitepaper is “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.”The anonymous author of the Cypherpunks post discusses the necessary prerequisites of digital cash, one feature of which is called “blinding:”“I wouldn't say ecash has to use blinding, but I would argue it would be a misuse of the word “ecash"", if something which was revocable were dubbed ecash.”“Blinding” likely refers to the idea of a cryptographic blind signature, introduced by David Chaum. It lets people securely sign data without revealing it, and then verifies that the data has not been tampered with. This functionality has become commonplace in the wake of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.The author of the anonymous post goes on to discuss another key obstacle that any electronic currency faces: the double spend problem.“One possibility is to make the double-spending database public. Whenever someone receives a coin they broadcast its value. The DB  [database] operates in parallel across a large number of servers so it is intractable to shut it down.”He concludes his post by mentioning the two proposals for electronic money that were referenced in the Bitcoin whitepaper: Wei Dai’s b-money and Adam Back’s Hashcash:“Another possible form of ecash could be based on Wei Dai's b-money. This is like hashcash, something which represents a measurable amount of computational work to produce. It therefore can't be forged. This could be a very robust payment system and is worth pursuing further.”In the course of a 200-word post, the anonymous touches on every major issue facing a usable digital currency, and does so 10 years before Bitcoin pulled them all together. It’s certainly not enough to conclude that the author is Satoshi Nakamoto, but the resemblance is striking."

And what they're doing is they're providing the world's worst dictators and regimes, either directly or indirectly, with information that violates the civil rights of millions of people.”He also added that in his opinion, it is immoral to work for such a company:“Just like I would consider it immoral to work for a weapons manufacturer or a company that builds cages for refugee concentration camps.”Jonathan Levin, Chainalysis co-founder and chief strategy officer in a statement to Cointelegraph, responded to the criticism, referring to a case reported earlier:“While U.S. agencies represent many of our governmental customers, we also work with other government agencies across the world. This is especially beneficial when law enforcement agencies from multiple countries work together, much like they did on the Welcome to Video case. We have policies and procedures in place that help us determine which governments we work with, and as a general rule Chainalysis does not work with dictatorial governments.”Levin noted that his company is “often criticized as being antithetical to the spirit of Bitcoin;” however, he believes that regulatory compliance is essential for the adoption of Bitcoin.It is not clear which regimes and dictators Antonopoulos had in mind. Chainalysis has assisted authorities from various countries in some of the most notorious cases involving cryptocurrency — exchange hacks, sexual exploitation as well sanction evasion. The latter elicits criticism of the company being U.S.-centric.In the same interview, Antonopoulos, admitted that Bitcoin’s original design was flawed in terms of privacy protection and that it has been slow to address them because of its inherent conservatism:“Bitcoin is fundamentally the most conservative system out there because it's intended to be extremely robust and secure and able to resist attacks by collusion or cooperation between nation-state-level actors.”Also, he noted that soon this problem will be fixed as new privacy-preserving enhancements are coming to the Bitcoin protocol:“Fortunately, there are a number of technologies that are likely to make that much better. One of them is a series of changes that are being introduced to bitcoin now. Schnoor signatures, taproots and tapescript.”Another tool that allows for enhanced privacy is lightning channels. Antonopoulos, a prolific blockchain author, noted that he is currently writing a book about the Lightning Network.According to Levin, Chainalysis is also watching and anticipating these developments:“We look at technologies like Schnorr signatures, taproots, and tapescript in much the same way and track their adoption and usage. These have long lead times and will be evaluated by businesses if their customers really demand these as features.”Andreas Antonopoulos declined to comment for this article."

High profile members of the crypto community like Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao expressed his thoughts on the lawsuit claims, calling them “very far fetched”.The firm has faced its fair share of legal action, whether short lived or not, over its XRP token, currently the third most valuable by market cap. A class-action lawsuit brought in May 2018 — and currently moving forward — by attorneys for XRP investor Bradley Sostack has similar allegations of deceiving investors and violating securities laws. While Sostack does seek damages and compensation for legal costs, one of his stated goals was the recognition of XRP as a security. However, an amendment filed on March 25 suggested he was hedging his bets on the possibility the court may not acknowledge it as such.

As we foresee fragilities of traditional asset classes, crypto markets seem to offer the bigger upside.”Echoing these comments, head of strategy, Chandan Choudhury, argued that “COVID-19 is an eye-opener,” which has exposed the “huge bubble across traditional asset classes fuelled by loose monetary policy.”In correspondence with Cointelegraph, Nischal Shetty, founder and CEO of the well-known Indian exchange, WazirX, revealed that the platform witnessed a month-on-month growth of over 80% in both March and April.It has also reported a steady increase in user sign-ups and attributes the uptick not only to the improved post-ban climate, but also to the exchange’s proactive role in the case levelled against the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)’s ban in the Supreme Court and its attendant social media #IndiaWantsCrypto campaign.Moreover, back in mid-2018 — when the RBI’s controversial imposition was still in force — WazirX had been prompted to transform its business model into a P2P platform so as to avoid in-house crypto-fiat conversion, thereby providing a degree of continuity for domestic traders.The last factor the exchange considers likely to be contributing to strong volumes is the adverse impact of India’s lockdown on the Indian stock market, which it contends may be leading more citizens to turn to Bitcoin as an alternative investment option.Even with the RBI’s ban now lifted, several of India’s crypto exchanges have recently collectively penned a letter to the institution claiming that the current absence of regulatory clarity has led some banks to continue denying services to exchanges dealing with crypto assets.Exchanges have asked for more clarity as to whether their operations will be classified as dealing with goods, currencies, commodities, or services in order to ascertain whether they are subject to the country’s Goods and Services Tax, or GST."

And that's why it really is important as an industry to step up and start disclosing whether the exchanges and custodians are actually solvent.”Long also urged crypto users to retain control over their private keys stating:“If you own your crypto assets outright, you should control your keys [...] I believe Bitcoin is a safe-haven asset precisely because it’s nobody’s IOU.”Long stated that her belief in Bitcoin as a safe-haven asset was not shaken by its violent March crash amid the global liquidity crisis, stating, “What we saw is it behaved exactly as gold behaved in 2008.”“Initially, it corrected by a lot because, in an environment where everybody is just indiscriminately selling everything, Bitcoin trades 24/7 and is easy to sell — it's a liquid market.” “Just because it didn't behave as a safe haven asset on the worst day of trading does not mean that it's not a safe haven asset,” she stated, adding, “I wasn't discouraged by that at all because I'd seen it before.”"

On May 1, Judge Bloom, who presides over the case, issued a court order for the trial to begin on July 6. More importantly, the lawyers representing both sides confirmed that they are not planning to file any motions that could delay the trial and are eagerly looking to the opportunity to prove their case in court.Dr. Wright’s attorney Andres Rivero told Cointelegraph that his client has always wanted to establish truth in court and there will be no delaying motions from their side:“it's always possible for the cases to be delayed, they could be motions, more requests by the plaintiffs […] But we have opposed all the delays and we’ve always wanted to go to trial. The plaintiffs would have to prove that there was a verbal agreement that 50% of everything that Dr. Wright did for the rest of his life belonged to Mr. Kleiman ”According to Rivero, Kleiman was a dear friend of Dr. Wright. However, this did not entitle him to half of Wright’s Bitcoins (BTC).In a statement released to Cointelegraph, Velvel Freedman of Roche Cyrulnik Freedman LLP, the firm represent Ira Kleiman, called those claims “absurd”:“Any comment that Plaintiffs are responsible for any delays to the trial date is absurd. As Judge Bloom found on January 10, 2020, Craig’s ‘antics and conduct delayed and obstructed the discovery process of this case, wasted valuable time and resources […] and prevented the Plaintiff from obtaining evidence.’ Plaintiffs are looking forward to the trial.”Rivero pointed out that the judge’s “sanctions against Dr. Wright were reversed, other than the fees”. Rivero does not have an estimate for how long the trial could take as in his opinion, the case has been “very usual”:“Your guess is as good as mine, because this is the first time I've ever seen anything like this.”Ira Kleiman, the brother of late Dave Kleiman, lays claim to the half of 1.1 million Bitcoins that Dr. Wright and Dave Kleiman allegedly mined together as part of the Satoshi Nakamoto team.According to Rivero, his client, Dr. Wright still maintains that he is Satoshi Nakamoto, despite many detractors questioning it. Recently, John McAfee said that with 99% certainty, he knows the true identity of the author of Bitcoin whitepaper, hinting that Dr. Wright could be part of the Satoshi Nakamoto team."

But anybody who wants to know who it is — I mean, you know who the options are, you’ve got Craig Wright possibly, I’m not going to name everyone else otherwise you’ll figure out who it is, but somebody wrote the whitepaper,” he continued. McAfee asserts that linguistic analysis of the whitepaper, also known as stylometry, is all that is needed to uncover Satoshi’s identity.“If you read the whitepaper, number one, it's totally clear he’s English — every single word that has a different spelling in English and American is English,” McAfee asserts.“Number two, he left tells. There is only five percent of the population that has two spaces after a period — everything has two spaces after a period. And, the format of the document was identical to documents that he had published professionally,” he adds.“If you buy a two-hundred dollar authorship program, and you take the whitepaper and you run it through, and you take any one of the papers that he’s published — all of these people wrote papers by the way, only one comes out with ninety-nine percent probability it's him.”McAfee recounts that he had previously planned to publicly reveal Satoshi’s identity, before deciding against such after a phone call with the individual.“I have spoken to him on the phone, I was actually going to divulge who he was. Why? Because all of this nonsense was just stupid, people wasting time over nothing — I was going to say, ‘listen, it was this guy,’” McAfee said.“And you know what he told me? Very smart motherf*****, he said ‘Ok, what if you’re wrong?’ He goes, ‘if you’re right, then Satoshi is going to have to hire fifty security guards and change his life,  or else he will die.’ Why? Everyone is going to want a piece of him, including the governments that demand that he pay taxes.”“He said, ‘Ok, if you’re right, then that person has the ability to do something. But what if you’re wrong? You will end up destroying an innocent man’s life forever, and probably cause his death,’” continued McAfee.“At that moment, I said ‘I understand, I won’t say no more, and your name will never leave my lips.’ And that is why I never continued past Craig Wright, because the name would have to leave my lips.”“But if you want to know, figure it out yourself, it's easy.“"

So maybe in those early years, like 2013, 2014, 2015, we could have been all a little bit more adult.”However, Shrem notes that the mistakes of yesterday were critical to underpinning the successes of today and tomorrow, stating: “But at the same time, the fact that we were kind of crazy and stupid is the reason that we're all here today with Bitcoin, you know.” “So it's kind of like I don't really like to look back at lessons learned because if we didn't make those mistakes, how do I know that I would be here talking to you today?” he added.On the subject of BitInstant, the pioneering crypto exchange co-founded by Shrem in 2011, Charlie stated that he is “really happy with the legacy of BitInstant.”“BitInstant ended up shutting down for a good reason, [...] we just couldn’t keep up with [the] regulations,” he stated. “I joke that we're one of the only crypto companies that actually didn't take money from our users and returned all our everyone's money and we shut down.”After comprising the sole platform facilitating near-instant Bitcoin purchases in the United States for two years, Shrem stated that the launch of Coinbase signalled the oncoming end of BitInstant:“We knew when Coinbase launched that our time was up because Coinbase was backed by a lot of money, by Silicon Valley — and Silicon Valley didn’t like me because I had been them ‘F you’ for so long.”“I knew our time was over,” Shrem stated, adding: “I was fine with that, our legacy is like Netscape.”"
99,https://cointelegraph.com,,Crypto Industry Divided Over Introducing Circuit Breakers on Exchanges,https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-industry-divided-over-introducing-circuit-breakers-on-exchanges,"Since the inception of Bitcoin, volatility has been a part of the 
cryptocurrency narrative even before exchanges and the current 
mainstream ...",,"Since the inception of Bitcoin, volatility has been a part of the cryptocurrency narrative even before exchanges and the current mainstream mentions. Now that traditional markets are showing volatility further exacerbated than anti-fragile cryptocurrency during the coronavirus pandemic, the community is seeing how traditional marketplaces like the New York Stock Exchange handle equity and commodity volatility through circuit breaker implementation. ","In cryptocurrency and decentralized finance, liquidation auctions have been the answer for periods of market turbulence. The prominence of the traditional marketplaces triggering the circuit breakers has led some cryptocurrency exchanges to implement similar measures. So as the community debates the needs for mechanisms to protect investors versus decentralization, there are a few options and scenarios to consider.When speaking on circuit markets and market volatility in a conversation with Cointelegraph, Vadym Kurylovych, the founder of STEX — a regulated cryptocurrency exchange based in Estonia — said:“Trading derivatives on the offshore exchanges looks similar to playing roulette in Madagascar casino. You knew you'd get busted the minute you joined but the potential payout entices you to take the risk.”While the popularity of derivatives and financial products continues to grow within the cryptocurrency ecosystem, educating investors is an important step that exchanges are now beginning to take. While this does not fully prepare non-sophisticated investors in advance for when strong solutions are developed, crypto is left borrowing protection mechanisms from the traditional space. For clarity, protection mechanisms in cryptocurrency will be broken down into circuit breakers at the exchange level as well as the token level. Mimicking the traditional market, some cryptocurrency exchanges have implemented protection mechanisms in the form of circuit breakers to safeguard their users, while others are resistant to this level of control citing decentralization or other measures to meet demand during periods of high liquidation. So, should exchanges implement circuit breakers to protect users from plummeting prices?The New York Stock Exchange implements “three circuit breaker thresholds that measure a decrease against the prior day’s closing price of the S&P 500 Index -- 7% (Level 1), 13% (Level 2), and 20% (Level 3).” When the first two levels are reached, a 15-minute suspension of trading occurs. At the level 3 threshold, daily trading ceases. In a conversation with Cointelegraph, Ryan Salame, head of OTC for Alameda Research — which manages over $100 million in digital assets and trades $600 million to $1.5 billion per day — stated:“[It] seems to me more like a philosophical debate than anything else, but I imagine you get a more stable market with circuit breakers thus a larger audience would be in favor of them. I personally love a 24/7 market with no circuit breakers and 100x leverage with high volatility, but can certainly see the argument against it.”The difference may be in the type of product being offered to the financial community. While Bitcoin is decentralized, other financial products in the cryptocurrency space may need circuit breakers to protect against black swan events just like the traditional market has experienced.The cryptocurrency market has many large liquidation events to point to, but recently, the now-infamous Black Thursday on BitMex is a great example. The massive sell-off was reportedly triggered by two DDoS attacks causing a flash crash in the Bitcoin (BTC) price. This attack did major damage to investors, and it is being reported that Binance now tops BitMex for Bitcoin Futures. BitMex lacks circuit breakers and therefore benefits financially in times of market volatility. While the financial benefit may have been large for BitMex, the fallout from not protecting users may cost the platform in the long run.Currently, Binance has not implemented any form of circuit breakers in their exchanges. In a recent interview with Cointelegraph, the exchange’s CEO Changpeng Zhao touched upon circuit breakers, but did not give out any indication of future Binance plans for them. He did, however, remark that “blockchain is much fairer in solving the fundamental problems of the old system, which means the fiat-based system.” This lends credence to Binance upholding its decentralized philosophy and resisting the development and implementation of circuit breakers. Jake Stott, the founder of blockchain think tank dGen, lent his insight in a conversation with Cointelegraph, saying, ”With circuit breakers, we start to see a cryptocurrency market that betrays some of the fundamental reasons for it to exist.” He went on to add:“Without circuit breakers, we may never see products such as a Bitcoin ETF, due to the huge price variations that could occur between the 24 hour and traditional exchange-traded product. I’m personally in favour of the circuit breakers because it appears much of the recent problems were caused by margin traders uncovered shorts and subsequent clogs in the Bitcoin and Ethereum networks. Price crashes were much more extreme for those reasons.”So what will cryptocurrency exchange circuit breakers look like? A circuit breaker introduced by the Huobi exchange may give some insight into how the industry’s trends could traverse. The liquidation circuit breakers only allow partial liquidation of orders rather than full liquidation, which previously was the case. The circuit breaker acts differently than traditional market circuit breakers, which are used to curb panic-selling. The Huobi circuit breaker will terminate liquidation orders on positions where the margin ratio is ≤0% when abnormal price deviation between the market price and liquidation price is identified. Related: What Is a ‘Circuit Breaker’ and Why Do Exchanges Need Them?While there have been calls to ban shorting, such a move could disrupt liquidity, while an approach like the one Huobi developed protects users’ funds first. While Huobi may be on the right path, Jens Willemen, a partner at Kairon Labs Market Making — which provides liquidity to exchanges — outlined implementation struggles for circuit breakers, saying that “for the smaller tokens, the ones that are just getting listed a circuit breaker would be a good thing,” adding that overall:“Circuit breakers do make sense for the larger, more liquid tokens to add in a bit more stability to the markets. In practice we believe this will be very hard to implement in the crypto space. Most tokens are listed on a number of different (unregulated) exchanges, getting all these exchanges to agree on when and how to implement these circuit breakers will be very difficult to say the least.”A similar sentiment was shared by Michael Creadon, a board advisor at Inveniam Capital Advisors — a digital financial instruments tool for private capital markets — told Cointelegraph that traders would be caught out either with or without circuit breakers in place:“Circuit breakers won’t work because there are too many exchanges and no centralized rule-making body. If Coinbase freezes up but the market moves another 50% on Binance, you won't be able to get out. So you’re damned if you do, damned if you don’t. For long term hodlers, I think this is less important. For day traders, this is very important. Circuit breakers are a good thing, but hard to deploy when there are hundreds, if not thousands, of trading venues.”Understandably, competition and high trade volume is beneficial to exchanges, which lends itself to a future where not all will implement circuit breakers. Exchanges will continue to ensure they make money even if practices may harm investors and prevent wipeouts due to system overloading and attacks. While exchange circuit breakers take the first step in protecting investors, the shortcomings appear to stem from the difficulty of widespread implementation and consensus on best practice. Additionally, individual tokens have the ability to implement governance circuit breakers and reserves in an effort to protect users.While discussing the potential of seeing token-level circuit breakers in any upcoming projects and launches with Cointelegraph, Leslie Lei, listing director for Cointiger — the first cryptocurrency exchange to introduce an equity mechanism through their native token — remarked:“The decentralized goal of the cryptocurrency industry will not be left up to the exchanges alone and a project we are aware of is already implementing circuit breakers like investment downside protection. We see innovative projects developing and launching daily that strive to meet the needs for the whole ecosystem in a decentralized fashion. Most options exchanges implement present major centralization issues with everyone running on different APIs, so the token-level approach may be a preferred solution while keeping users’ interests first.”While DeFi companies seek an alternative to overarching exchange circuit breakers, the potential solution could also lie in non-correlating reserves. While this is possible and currently being implemented with DAI, Dmitri Laush, CEO of GetID — an omnichannel Know Your Customer solution — noted to Cointelegraph:“The Crypto industry is still in the Wild West zone in survival mode, with monopoly or duopoly on this market finally we can see those rules, but it will not in the near future. And as altcoins usually reflect BTC and ETH in their drops and raises, the circuit breakers can help traders dealing with altcoins and tokens as well.”The dependence on volatile assets such as Bitcoin and Ether (ETH) places strain on reserves and values of tokens. A recent example is Ethereum’s crash creating issues for DAI during Black Thursday. MakerDAO remedied the dependence on a volatile Ethereum and implemented another reserve that utilizes USD Coin (USDC), a fiat-pegged stablecoin. Liquidity through demand or reserves is necessary, yet only reserves can be legally controlled.Eventually, cryptocurrencies may need to add their own circuit breakers to protect the baseline value of assets. For example, during the DAI Auction, a number of users won liquidation auctions for 0 DAI because of a bug. While the Ethereum used to create the DAI was not worth 0, the drop in price caused mass auctions to occur. These failures triggered a $28 million lawsuit against the Maker Foundation.For this reason, reserves themselves may need to act as a circuit breaker. For example, Gemini Dollar does not see major exchange fluctuations because it is minted and burned at a 1:1 ratio to the fiat currency it tokenizes. Likewise, Bancor-based reserves produce slippage on available funds in a transparent way to disperse liquidations.The community appears split on whether cryptocurrency and exchanges should implement circuit breakers and is even more divided on whether those circuit breakers should be at the exchange level or token level. However, one piece seemed clear throughout all the opinions and developmental research: Projects that focus on the success of investors and users will come out of this as winners."

pandemic and the Bitcoin halving frenzy, the latter of which is said to ...",,"Chinese cryptocurrency hardware manufacturer Bitmain seems to be bouncing back after a streak of dismal reports. Earlier this week, a local industry blog revealed that the mining giant has accumulated over $300 million in revenue so far this year and is rewarding employees with massive bonuses on Labor Day.","Bitmain has since confirmed that information to Cointelegraph but ignored additional questions. Therefore, how does a mining company go about scoring profits amid the pandemic and the Bitcoin halving frenzy, the latter of which is said to shake things up for miners? Bitmain was founded in 2013 by Jihan Wu and Micree Zhan. At the time, Wu was a private equity fund manager, while Zhan was raising funds for his TV streaming startup. Wu had allegedly spent all his savings on Bitcoin (BTC) and was looking for a way to accumulate more of the asset through industry-scale mining.In November 2013, Wu and Zhan developed an ASIC chip that allowed to mine BTC at full capacity, thus revolutionizing the industry that had been fully reliant on less-efficient CPU setups. Bitmain’s sales soon skyrocketed (despite some turbulence caused by Mt. Gox) and by mid-2018, the company was valued at $15 billion after reportedly closing a pre-initial public offering funding round. Around the same time, Bitmain announced its plans to expand into the field of artificial intelligence as the Chinese government began applying more pressure to the mining industry. Apparently, it was Zhan’s idea to open up an AI arm, while Wu was not fully supportive of that direction and even reportedly once called Zhan’s plan “crazy” during an internal meeting.As Bitmain began preparing for an IPO, the company hit another rough patch due to the crypto winter that was intensifying at the time. As a result of the collapsed BTC price, Bitmain purportedly sold a substantial amount of its mining equipment at a loss throughout 2018, hoping to secure the majority of the market share for better times. Additional reports suggested that the mining giant introduced austerity measures that included massive layoffs and the suspension of its colossal $500-million blockchain data center and mining facility in Rocksdale, Texas. By January 2020, Bitmain’s market share by hash rate had ostensibly dropped from around 75% to 66%, while an additional report came out suggesting that the mining titan is planning to reduce its workforce by another 50% prior to the upcoming Bitcoin halving — which will cut the amount of BTC awarded to miners by half.On top of everything else, Bitmain’s plan to go public via the Hong Kong Stock Exchange eventually stalled, as companies that were previously listed as Bitmain investors began denying their involvement in the IPO.In addition to the aforementioned problems, the company has found itself in the midst of an ongoing legal battle between two of its co-founders. The issue sparked in October 2019 when Wu, who abandoned his post as CEO of Bitmain in 2018 to take on a non-executive role on its board, suddenly ousted Zhan, who was the firm’s partner and chairman at the time, from Bitmain.According to the alleged transcripts of an internal meeting that supposedly took place one day prior to the incident, Wu told Bitmain employees that he was going to take matters into his own hands and improve Bitmain’s declining share of the Bitcoin mining pie. Additionally, he forbade staff to have any interaction with the ex-senior executive, threatening to fire those who don’t conform, and took over the company as a legal representative.Zhan started to fight back, filing two lawsuits against Bitmain. He submitted the first one in December 2019 to a court in the Cayman Islands where Bitmain Beijing — the firm’s holding entity — is registered, while the second lawsuit was brought in last month against the company’s AI subsidiary, Fujian Zhanhua Intelligence Technology, in a Chinese court. “If someone wants a war, we will give them one,” Zhan reportedly claimed, arguing that he owned 36% of the company’s equity.In January, Wu handed over the company’s legal representative post to Luyao Liu, the CFO of Bitmain. However, the Beijing Haidian District Bureau of Justice has recently overruled that appointment after Zhan had appealed the decision in February. It was a partial victory for Zhan since the court didn’t uphold his request to appoint him as Bitmain’s legal representative but disrupted the distribution of power within the firm by Wu.Despite the legal problems, it looks like the winds are finally changing for Bitmain. On April 29, a Chinese industry blog published a report suggesting a number of positive changes for the mining giant. Bitmain later confirmed the information to Cointelegraph that it had earned over $300 million in the first four months of 2020 and regained some market share, as it opened four new mining facilities and saw the hash rate increase in two of its mining pools.Bitmain has also confirmed that it will be rewarding its employees with individual bonuses of up to 70,000 yuan (about $9,900) on Labor Day, which is scheduled for May 1. The bonus payments would amount to “millions of yuan.” Additionally, Bitmain has streamlined its AI department’s operation. Namely, the company has developed the software for image recognition of rare birds to assist wildlife protection agencies, among other AI projects. Philip Salter, the head of mining operations at Genesis Mining, is not surprised by the company’s performance. Salter told Cointelegraph:“They have the very profitable S17+ product and, of course, now the new S19. Bitcoin prices have been low, which reduces Bitmain’s opportunistic prices. And this means that large miners could have placed large orders to stock up on equipment at low prices!”The COVID-19 pandemic, which has reportedly dwarfed China’s mining operations and forced some facilities to shut down, doesn’t seem to be stopping Bitmain either. In a recent comment for Cointelegraph, the company’s representative said Bitmain is following professional advice for dealing with the pandemic while continuing to sell its Antminer rigs. Salter suggested that Bitmain could have even reached an agreement with the Chinese government to continue its operation during the lockdown:“Who knows, maybe Bitmain had some special deals with the government to continue production of miners? I would not be surprised if high-value companies like Bitmain get exceptions from the rules.”As for the upcoming Bitcoin halving, it is not likely to cause Bitmain any serious financial problems — if anything, it will drive off weaker actors, as Mark D’Aria, the CEO of Bitpro Consulting LLC, suggested in an email conversation with Cointelegraph: “The halving is going to be toughest on the hardware manufacturers producing the least efficient hardware, and on the miners with the least efficient operations. Difficulty will adjust to a new normal quickly, and the weakest of both will be flushed out. Once hashrate has adjusted, we will definitely see some clear winners and losers.”The halving will create margin pressure on many miners if Bitcoin remains below $9K, primarily the inefficient ones, Matt D’Souza, the CEO of crypto mining hardware broker Blockware Solutions, told Cointelegraph, elaborating:“A majority of old generation and mid-generation equipment is going to have to shut off. If Bitcoin is at $9K or below, you can expect about 20%–30% of the network to shut off. If $9K remains for several weeks beyond the halving, it will create a health cleanse for the network.”Alireza Beikverdi, the CEO of crypto exchange software firm bitHolla, is also confident about Bitmain’s future, as he recalled his visit to the company’s headquarters in a conversation with Cointelegraph:“Bitmain has a big monitor in the middle of their office, and you would expect it to show Bitcoin hash rate, their sales stats, or maybe their new models, etc. But, instead, it’s only displaying Bitcoin price.”Price volatility can make a big difference for mining companies and their future operations, Beikverdi continued, meaning that it is considered one of the most important metrics. Bitmain controls two large mining pools, Antpool and BTC.com, which account for over 30% of the entire Bitcoin network. “They have multiple business streams that are not really affected much by the pandemic as long as Bitcoin price stays strong,” Beikverdi summed up. Bitmain has made strong statements against the backdrop of the recent good news. It has heavily criticized the Beijing Haidian District Bureau of Justice’s ruling in a statement, going as far as to argue that it has violated corporate laws. The firm has also reassured customers and investors that the results of the ongoing squabble between Wu and Zhan will not have any impact on Bitmain’s production or operation, while the AI arm will remain under the firm’s control. Should the court go ahead and register Zhan as the legal representative of Bitmain Beijing, the corporation will allegedly remain unfazed. Bitmain Beijing is just one of the more than 10 subsidiaries of Bitmain, it noted. Meanwhile, toward the end of 2019, the mining juggernaut quietly filed a Deutsche Bank-backed application for an IPO with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, meaning that it might continue its comeback by going public in the future — maybe even sometime later this year."

The largest pools have less than 20% of the computing power of the whole network, and the assets on the Bitcoin network become more secure.”"

If Bitcoin decides to move upwards, Chainlink and Tezos generally move up as well, but in a way higher degree than Bitcoin itself. Chainlink and Tezos are the two strongest trending coins in the past 18 months and each regularly shows massive volatility and volume for traders. However, after such a surge, it’s more likely to see short term corrective movements than further upwards momentum. Especially given the current market sentiment in which people fear for their financial situation. Equity markets remain shaky and it seems that a breakdown in Bitcoin price is on the way. LINK BTC 6-hour chart. Source: TradingViewOn the 6-hour timeframe, LINK/BTC shows a potential bearish divergence and a clear resistance area to which the coin surged.Crucial for confirmation of this bearish divergence would be a drop below $3.30-$3.35, as that’s the current support. The $3.30-$3.35 is also an area that’s been the previous top in an earlier surge. Losing the $3.30-$3.35 level would confirm downwards pressure and a trend reversal, through which the bearish divergence is confirmed as well. If such a breakdown occurs, likely levels to target are at $2.80 and possibly $2.20-$2.30.LINK BTC 1-day chart. Source: TradingViewThe 1-day chart currently shows strength and a similar conclusion can be drawn regarding the LINK/USDT. However, potential bearish divergences confluent with decreasing volume can be spotted. If the price decides to reverse and lose the green zone around 0.000490000 satoshis, the price is prepped for a further decline in the coming weeks. If the green zone is lost then traders will shift their focus to the 0.00044000 sats and 0.00035000sats levels. However, breaking through the high at 0.00053000 sats signals that a new all-time high is on the cards.XTZ USDT 1-day chart. Source: TradingViewThe XTZ/USDT pair shows a similar chart as Chainlink and the price surged more than 150% in just a month. However, similar weaknesses can also be spotted in the recent movements of the markets, through which assumptions can be made that the price is close to reverse in trend.XTZ USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingViewThe 4-hour shows Tezos was unable to break through the daily resistance at $2.35 and reversed. However, unlike Chainlink, the price is not resting on its previous top from April 12. Tezos price is resting on its last support at $2.08 and losing this level would lead to a heavy dropdown to $1.78 or lower and an apparent confirmation of a trend shift. On the upside, levels to be watched should be the $2.24-$2.25 area. A clear rejection from this zone would mean that this level has flipped resistance from support. After such rejection, a further decline is likely to occur for the markets.However, if the $2.24 level can be reclaimed for support, a further surge towards $2.50-$2.60 is back on the tables. Such a move would be similar to Bitcoin moving to $7,600-$8,000.XTZ BTC 1-day chart. Source: TradingViewThe XTZ/BTC pair is currently fighting a crucial level as the 0.00003200 sats level is the last massive resistance until the highs can be tested again. An apparent breakthrough of this monthly level would mean a continuation to the market and a likely surge towards 0.00003750 sats.XTZ BTC 4-hour chart. Source: TradingViewThe 4-hour chart shows a clear rejection from the monthly level, through which a bearish divergence can be spotted on the RSI as well. Through such a structure, in the short term, it’s more likely to have a slight extension of the current correction than an immediate breakthrough of the monthly level.In that regard, if Tezos can hold the 0.00002925 sats or 0.00002750sats-0.00002800sats level for support, a further test of the monthly level is on the tables. As stated above, a breakthrough at the monthly level would mean a further surge towards the highs around 0.00003800 sats. The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

No one is going to part with their piece for less than a Bitcoin [later on]. That would be insane. At best, you might get 10 BTC for your piece later, should you ever sell it.”STEREOSCOPIC by Vesa Kivinen, Courtesy of the artistThe anticipated halving-related BTC bull run would have the potential to bring more people into the crypto community and crypto art — ten times as many according to Kivinen.

The report emphasized swings in Bitcoin (BTC)’s hash rate and the phasing out of older ASIC models.","However, volatility has had a greater impact on Chinese miners — with Antminer S9s becoming unprofitable during March.The report describes BTC hash rate as having been “extremely volatile” during the early months of 2020 — ranging from between roughly 70 exahashes per second (EH/s) and 100 EH/s.According to the report, the profit margins of older ASIC units are “being squeezed out by the newer generation miners.”TokenInsight finds that the profitability of Bitmain’s Antminer S9’s was approximately 35% in the early months of 2020 before plummeting into negative territory amid the March crypto crash. However, the report notes that the profitability of S9’s rebounded back to roughly 20% during April.While the report notes that that the coronavirus pandemic has had “a negative impact on mining farms globally,” Chinese miners have been the hardest hit as many operators in the west have adapted to the crisis by reorganizing operations.At the start of April, Cointelegraph reported that 40 mining operations in China were forced to shut down as the March crash rendered S9-based companies unprofitable — with F2pool reporting that roughly 2.3 million miners had gone offline since Mach 10.Further, supply chain shocks have resulted in delays to the expected shipping dates for next-generation ASICs in June, fuelling predictions.Despite a 60% crash in the number of new ASIC miners coming online quarter-over-quarter, the firm reports that Q1 2020 saw the highest number of ASICs active on the Bitcoin network in three years.The report also identifies that the majority ASICs available on the market today are designed for algorithms other than Bitcoin’s SHA-256 — with 86 SHA-256 miners compared to the 97 ASICs available for various altcoins.Speaking to Cointelegraph, TokenInsight’s head of research and analytics, Johnson Xu, stated that “the non-SHA256 mining is gaining traction in the industry [as] some of the GPU-only altcoins have been taken over by the ASICs.”Looking forward, Johnson identifies two major issues that the mining sector must soon address.Xu urges to the industry “to work together to bring more transparency,” noting that “there is a lot of information asymmetry in the mining sector,“ He asserts that uneven access to information makes it “hard for institutions and individuals to make an informed decision — which is unhealthy in the long term.”Xu also asks for eastern and western miners to have greater trust in one another, stating: “If the industry wants to expand the business scope and bring dynamic products to serve different individual needs, trust is the most important thing.”"

What do you think is going to happen?”Charlie also took aim at the stock market, describing the S&P 500 as a metric that the government can manipulate “to let the people think that everything is ok”.“The stock market, I don't have faith in it — it's very manipulatable. I don't know any stocks for that reason [...] You're telling me that half the country doesn't have a job, but the stock market is making all-time highs. How is that something that we can correlate to how our economy's actually doing?”Despite his bullish predictions for the halving, Shrem told Cointelegraph that it still may be many months before the impacts on supply are fully felt.“I was looking at data, and it looks like around last halving it wasn't that the price doubled instantly, but the last halving was actually the start of the epic bull run in 2017 — which was a year and a half later. But the halving was definitely [when the] 'clock' started with the miners,” he said.“[I]t was a bullish momentum that started because it was post-halving and the selling pressure had halved. So there were a lot of really good things that worked out around that time — and I think we'll see that again.”On the question of what Shrem looks for when looking for thought leaders in the space, Charlie argued that executives that lead sizable companies are typically accountable for their opinionsShrem stated: “If you're ever wondering who to follow on crypto Twitter or who to listen to — a great metric that I like to use is how many people are working for this person? Are they building a company? If yes, how many people are there? [...] Because that means that this person's opinion could alter his company.“If this person says something stupid, his company can get the s*** — if that happens, all of his employees are out of a job. So he's morally responsible [for] his opinion.”"

In addition, users have reported problems with the power supply fans on the S17. Both pieces of equipment are designed to regulate the heat generated by the mining gear. As a result, nearly a third have been shorted out by the reported problems.#Bitmain customers report that Antminer S17/T17’s have a 20-30% failure rate (normally 5%).

Wu ousted Zhan from the company in October 2019 “to save this ship [from sinking].”Mow’s tweet comes a mere 15 days before the expected Bitcoin halving, with both cryptocurrency mining manufacturers MicroBT and Bitmain in stiff competition. However, supply chain disruptions as a result of COVID-19 have left many in the crypto community expecting delays in mining equipment. Bitmain successfully sold out their updated S19 Antminer Pro with a hash rate of 110 terahashes per second (TH/s) on March 23, but later announced the units would not be shipped until May 11 at the earliest, just one day before the halving. Many have speculated that Bitmain chose this date so that it could mine using its next-generation ASICs without competition before the next fork occurs.MicroBT, on the other hand, reported their flagship MS30S++ model from the M30 series of Bitcoin miners would have a hash rate of 112 TH/s. The mining manufacturer has said the hardware would be ready to ship in June."

The platform is reaching 70,000 users per day, and over 400,000 active users per month. Bling’s flagship app, Bitcoin Blast, has furthermore passed one million downloads from Google Play Store.Bling CEO Amy Wan told Cointelegraph that she chalks these statistics up to people being stuck at home “and bored.” Not only are there more users than before, but people are spending more time in their apps. Most of these users are located in the United States, the Philippines, Indonesia and Brazil.Wan said that this trend has been taking place for mobile gaming in general. Most companies in this space are seeing more downloads and increased activity amid the quarantine requirements around the world.Wan said:“We think that this may be an opportunity for many folks who previously heard of Bitcoin but never got around to learning much about it to take that time to learn and collect some Bitcoin. Whereas many crypto companies focus on selling Bitcoin, our unique proposition is that we give it away for free through gameplay.”She added that the current situation is both “a blessing and a curse.” Yes, Bling is seeing more users spend more time in its apps.

All these fit under a canopy of anonymity services that help protect the privacy of users’ web presence.In the case of Black Host, the provider also supports cryptocurrency purchasing for its services, adding another layer of pseudonymous protection. Although many users’ privacy concerns are legitimate, Chainalysis notes, in the case of Black Host its analysis has identified that its services were used, back in May 2018, by a Bitcoin (BTC) address associated with the North Korean government-aligned cybercriminal Lazarus Group. The second of Chainalysis briefs casts the spotlight on the Iranian cryptocurrency exchange ecosystem, in particular a popular local trading platform, Farhad Exchange. While many established crypto peer-to-peer sites such as Localbitcoins have halted operations in Iran for fear of fines of United States sanctions violations, domestic exchanges have continued to operate. This is despite the Central Bank’s pledge to crack down on private cryptocurrency projects in recent years.Farhad, which supports Iranian rials, U.S. dollar and Russian ruble e-currencies from WebMoney, and major cryptocurrencies, has an active social media and online educational program for domestic crypto users. Over 20,000 BTC addresses attributed to the exchange have been identified by Chainalysis, involved in over 46,000 transactions. These have purportedly become less active in recent months, and overall hold a balance of under 1 Bitcoin. Nonetheless, they do continue to transact as of April 29, and addresses associated with the platform have received 7,993.09 BTC and sent 7,978.77 BTC since 2016.In its most recent traffic, Farhad has interacted with mainstream exchanges, as well as higher-risk entities, gambling sites and peer-to-peer platforms. Between 2014 to 2017, the exchange received 74 BTC from an address linked to an Iranian national sanctioned for his role in assisting the SamSam ransomware attackers to convert BTC into rials.The last of Chainalysis’ briefs focuses on a Poland-based crypto Ponzi Scheme, FutureNet, which has established an infrastructure of mock companies to create a veneer of legitimacy for the scam. Last month, Cointelegraph reported on Chainalysis’ analysis of the use of cryptocurrencies to purchase child sexual abuse material on the darknet, which found that such transactions had increased by 32% in 2019 over the previous year."

""If you want to lock yourself down, more power to you, feel free, have at it. But for the rest of us that want to live our lives, we should be able to do that too.”Ver joins another high-profile tech figure, Tesla's Elon Musk, in calling for an end to lockdowns. On Wednesday, Musk called the extension of lockdowns ""fascist"" and an ""outrage""  that was ""forcibly imprisoning people in their own homes against all their constitutional rights.”Ver spoke to Cointelegraph directly after delivering a keynote presentation that covered how digital currencies can help bring more economic freedom to the world.Ver linked the two concepts:""If you're locked down, you can't go to work, you can't live your life, you can't go to the store, you can't get things done that you need to get done. It's absolutely related not just to economic freedom, but to personal freedom in general.”He added, ""It's really frustrating to see just how many people are silent about this, you know, the crazy stripping of people's freedom across the planet.""The debate over how to balance human safety with human freedom heated up in recent weeks with a series of anti-lockdown rallies in the U.S. Lockdown proponents argue that the medical and epidemiological advice is clear that staying home saves lives by reducing community transmission of the coronavirus.But Ver suggested that argument fails to account for unintended consequences. ""The economic ramifications of this worldwide shutdown of the economy is going to cause way more people to die than the coronavirus itself,"" he said.Ver added that while coronavirus deaths are obvious and reported on each day on the news, the deaths caused by a cratering economy will be hidden:""You don't necessarily see all the other people around the world that died because they weren't able to earn as much money as they were able to before, so they didn't go to the doctor to get the checkup that detected the cancer […] They didn't have the money to pay for the high blood pressure medication and then they ended up having a stroke.""A newly released study from University College London provides some evidence for Ver’s contention. It found a 60 percent drop in attendance for chemotherapy and a 76 percent drop in urgent referrals of suspected cancers in the U.K. as people avoided doctors and hospitals during lockdown. The study’s authors forecast 20,000 additional cancer deaths as a result.  But Ver has come under criticism for downplaying the seriousness of the threat from Coronavirus on Twitter.If YOU are worried about the coronavirus, YOU should self isolate.Leave the rest of us alone. pic.twitter.com/9DUzsdtnCyHe denied he was downplaying it, he just thinks the response needs to be different. ""No I think people misinterpreted my truth, I'm not dismissing the threat but let's say the threat's really really real. I think the same logic applies,” he said. ""When the plague was going through Europe they didn't have everybody self isolate, they just put the sick people away from the healthy people and now they're doing the exact opposite.”Ver’s Virtual Blockchain Week presentation highlighted a clear correlation between countries with high levels of economic freedom, and higher incomes for both rich and poor, life expectancy, literacy, environmental protections, fewer violent conflicts, less corruption and higher self reported happiness.He defined ‘economic freedom’ as ""a measure of how easy it is for members of a society to participate in the economy"" with factors including free trade, property rights, the ease of starting a business, labor and business regulation and currency stability. Countries ranked highly for economic freedom include Hong Kong, Singapore, Switzerland and Australasia, while the worst ranked included North Korea, Venezuela, Cuba, the Congo and Eritrea.“It's very very clear, which one of those two lists of countries just about everybody listening here would rather live in,” he said."

Your wealth will sit overnight with a patch-work of exchanges not subject to regulatory authorities and for whose financial strength you know little about. LOL with that one.”He also warned investors against the idea that holding funds in Tether will prevent them from being investigated by the Internal Revenue Service or having to pay tax on their holdings:“Point of clarification for U.S. citizens. Selling BTC or other cryptos for tether does NOT let you escape the IRS. The trigger to the IRS is the amt of cryptos sold/traded. Once you hit that level (AND THAT LEVEL WILL BE DOWN TO $1k within years) you will be reported by exchange.”Brandt is far from Tether’s only critic. In 2018, research suggested that Tether issuance was a form of market manipulation that had caused the price pump to the all time high. The research was cited in multiple lawsuits against the firm. However, more recent research contradicted the idea.Still, many people do believe there’s a correlation between the issuance of Tether and BTC price rallies. According to reports based on Whalebot Alerts, Tether issued more than $1 billion new Tether coins immediately before a rally that saw Bitcoin recover the majority of losses seen in March. And in the past day, Whalebot Alerts, also reported that an unknown wallet had transferred 50 million USDT to Binance just minutes before Bitcoin jumped $400 to almost $8,800.Tweet:🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 50,015,000 #USDT (50,036,755 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to #BinanceTx: https://t.co/rBHriAswynFor years Tether claimed it held 100% reserve in USD, however it emerged during a court case that Tether reserves can sit as low as 74%. Tether has not been subject to a public audit and their relationship with their previous auditor was dissolved in 2018.Brandt is not backward in coming forwards. Yesterday he called Bitcoin traders ‘amateurs’ in relation to their supposedly short-sighted views on the coin’s price action:Tweet: Come on you amateurs, you can do better than this. You are missing the forest from the trees. This is a 28-month coil with the price action most recently being the famous ""six-blind-mice signal."" Get with it. pic.twitter.com/YjKpFBwpG7That said, two days earlier Brandt claimed he wasn’t going to Tweet about Bitcoin anymore. “I no longer Tweet on BTC. Too many disrespectful trolls,” he said.It appears he finds the subject too interesting to stay away."

This patent portfolio poses a legal threat to blockchain projects from Bitcoin Cash to Lightning, and critics argue it goes against the open-source nature of blockchain and is a form of patent trolling.Coingeek founder and Wright’s mentor Calvin Ayre returned fire by saying that Buterin doesn’t understand blockchain and claiming Ethereum was a platform that had cultivated ICO scams.Tweet:actually, you don't understand Blockchains. You can not even copy Craig correctly. You tech has been used for more scams in the ICO shitecoin storm than the world has ever seen. History will not be kind. Patents on the other hand are a real thing.The conversation devolved from there with Buterin saying “BSV does not scale” and Ayre firing back that “this [conversation] is stupid” and various BSV and Ethereum proponents weighing in.The CEO of Dragonchain Joe Roets was inspired to publish a blog post in support of both blockchain’s open source philosophy and the patent system. Dragonchain DApp Eternal also immortalized Buterin’s comments on the Dragonchain blockchain, where it can never be deleted or censored. President of the Bitcoin Association Jimmy Nguyen — a former nChain CEO —  said in March the actual number of patents filed had only just reached 666. He summed up the fears of the blockchain community on the subject pretty well:“If you listen to the online trolls, Craig is hell-bent on patenting all of Bitcoin and the entire blockchain as part of his quest for world domination”But Nguyen, a former patent attorney, said it was only right that blockchain companies seek to patent their technologies:“Like any sensible business, we also like to protect our investment by securing intellectual property rights when appropriate. With hard work and great expense, nChain has produced what we believe is the world’s largest and best quality blockchain patent portfolio in the world.”However Craig Wright told Micky in February that he’d launched the patent portfolio to gain control over the Bitcoin forks and altcoins:“Basically it came down to if I want to actually … try and stop all the splits, forks and altcoin scams that are popping up pretending to be blockchains, then the only way I could really think to do it was to start patenting.”Key individuals in the cryptosphere such as Peter Mckormack, Roger Ver and CZ from Binance have all expressed concerns about nChain’s patent portfolio."
115,https://cointelegraph.com,,Two Crypto Exchanges Paid High Ethererum Fees to Ensure Quick Withdrawals,https://cointelegraph.com/news/two-crypto-exchanges-paid-high-ethererum-fees-to-ensure-quick-withdrawals,"At the time, the Bitcoin (BTC) price dropped by around 50 percent in a 
single day, causing the price of Ether to plunge to as low as $85 across ...",,"Data provided exclusively to Cointelegraph by blockchain and crypto analytics firm Flipside Crypto shows that Binance and OKEx paid large fees for Ether (ETH) withdrawals when the Bitcoin price crashed to $3,600 on March 13, a day dubbed as “Black Thursday” among investors in the cryptocurrency market.","At the time, the Bitcoin (BTC) price dropped by around 50 percent in a single day, causing the price of Ether to plunge to as low as $85 across major exchanges.As an unprecedented cascade of liquidations pushed the entire market downward in a short period of time, requests for withdrawals on exchanges also surged as investors began to demonstrate a high level of fear.Amidst all the panic, Binance and OKEx, two of the largest crypto exchanges paid, higher than the average price of ""gas""—a term used to describe fees paid on the Ethereum blockchain network to transfer data or payments—to seamlessly process user withdrawals.As shown in the Flipside Crypto chart exclusively shared with Cointelegrah, the amount of gas paid on the Ethereum network by Binance, Coinbase, OKEx, Kucoin, and Kraken indicates that Binance and OKEx paid up to 400 percent higher fees to ensure withdrawal transactions are included in the following block.Gas fees paid on Ether withdrawals by top exchanges. Source: Flipside CryptoFlipside Crypto CEO Dave Balter told Cointelegraph:“Binance and OKEx appear to be paying a constant rate significantly above the prevailing market price, as evidenced by the yellow and red parallel lines on the graph. This ensures that their transactions have the best chance of being included in the next block. When the price of gas spiked, around 8AM UTC on March 12th, they both had to compute a new threshold for their transactions to go through.”Most exchanges have a fixed fee rate for trading, deposits, and withdrawals. Since a significant spike in on-chain activity on major blockchain networks like Ethereum and Bitcoin rarely occurs, exchanges typically maintain a stable withdrawal cost over a prolonged period of time.As an example, on Binance, the standard fee for Ether withdrawals is 0.003 ETH, which is equivalent to around $0.57.Apart from blockchain network fees, withdrawal fees on exchanges also cover a variety of operations on the exchange side such as costs involved in security, maintenance, and automated audits.When an exchange pays an unusually high fee to process a withdrawal, it decreases the amount of revenue the exchange obtains from it to finance all of its other operations that are needed to settle withdrawal requests.Coinbase and Kraken, however, appeared to be actively predicting gas costs in real time and adjusting fees based on changes of user activity on the Ethereum network. According to Flipside Crypto data scientist Will Price, this may have led users to wait a few blocks until their withdrawals were fully processed, potentially causing some delay. Price said:""Coinbase and Kraken appear to be continuously monitoring the network and updating their gas prices accordingly, as seen in the blue and pink lines on our graph. If these predictions turn out to be inaccurate, then users may have to wait a few extra blocks for their transactions to be processed. These few extra seconds could make a big difference for users attempting to arbitrage prices across exchanges.""Whether exchanges would have to pay high fees following the launch of ETH 2.0 and the anticipated transition from the proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus algorithm remains to be seen.Upon the shift, fees on the Ethereum network are expected to drop substantially from current levels. This means the next time congestion builds up on the network, exchanges may not have to cover the fees on behalf of their users."
116,https://cointelegraph.com,,Surviving Crypto Volatility With Derivatives Contracts,https://cointelegraph.com/news/surviving-crypto-volatility-with-derivatives-contracts,"Amid the pessimism, Bitcoin (BTC) broke below the $4,000 mark on Black 
Thursday and fell nearly 50% from recent highs. It's been over a month ...",,"Volatility has been the dominant theme in financial markets lately. As uncertainty around COVID-19 and its impact on the economy deepens, markets have been swinging wildly. We’ve seen the S&P 500 falling off a cliff as well as risk assets across the board taking a beating. Cryptocurrency markets have been no different and have exhibited extreme volatility. Amid the pessimism, Bitcoin (BTC) broke below the $4,000 mark on Black Thursday and fell nearly 50% from recent highs. ","It’s been over a month since the crash, and though we have seen prices bouncing back sharply, the sentiment has not improved. There is still a fair amount of fear among traders, and they continue to stay hawkish. Such sharp moves hurt market confidence, and it will take some time before traders get comfortable carrying overnight risk again.It is hard to say how long it will take for the markets to recover and for the true impact of the current crisis to be visible. Some estimates suggest that it will take as long as 12–18 months for the world economy and markets to fully overcome this shock. Given the backdrop, it’s fair to say that markets should remain choppy for some time and that the volatility is here to stay.Extreme volatility in the markets spells trouble for traders caught on the wrong side of price swings. On March 12, the price of Bitcoin dropped by over 40% and subsequently recovered 16% the next day. Over $750 million worth of positions went into liquidation amid these swings. Bitcoin implied volatility spiked to 250% per annum in March, and though it has cooled down to about 70%, it still remains quite rich. Carrying directional trades in such volatile market conditions is very risky. In fact, the higher the volatility, the higher the directional risk for traders. If traders don’t maintain enough margin in their positions, there is a chance of getting caught on a price whipsaw and getting liquidated. Violent price swings have been a regular feature since Black Thursday. This has made directional trading difficult not only for new traders but also for veterans. In calm market conditions, traders look to profit by catching the momentum of the market direction. If they predict the market direction correctly, they register a profit. Similarly, if the market moves against them, there will be losses. The amount by which a trader’s portfolio is going to get impacted per unit movement in price is called “delta” — a measure of directional risk. There is another risk to a trader’s portfolio, something that most traders tend to ignore during calm market conditions: the risk of price swinging up and down while it drifts in a particular direction. This risk to a trader’s portfolio is called “vega” and measures the risk against change in volatility.Just as traders use futures contracts to position themselves for directional risk, options are useful for protecting against rising or falling market volatility. Traders can also use options to remove directional risk from their portfolios, partially or completely, and bet on market volatility alone. Some exchanges are at the forefront of innovation here and are offering products that allow traders to trade the volatility risk without taking any directional risk. Hence, should a trader believe that the market is going to stay volatile, they can buy volatility without exposing themselves to the effects of which direction the market moves in.As crypto derivatives markets mature, we are seeing more and more traders participate in options markets and trading volatility. In traditional markets such as equities, the volumes on options contracts can be multifold of those on futures contracts. Though crypto options markets have existed for a few years now, the volumes have been slow to pick up. Most crypto traders find options trading difficult to understand and intimidating. There is a need to package options in a way so that traders can easily understand the payoff profile without diving into the nitty-gritty. This would help reduce the friction and increase the demand for crypto options trading. A MOVE contract is one such product. Herein, a trader holds a straddle: a multilegged options position that will benefit from higher market volatility irrespective of market direction. One of the ways to own volatility is to buy a straddle. A straddle is nothing but a call and a put option combined together. Hence, one can create a long straddle position by buying a call option and a put option that have the same strike price and maturity. If the market rises, the call option becomes profitable; should the market fall, the put option starts to payoff. Building a straddle position by oneself can be complex for traders. Not only do they need to find liquidity in both the call and put options, but they must also execute both the legs of the trade simultaneously. MOVE contracts are nothing but a packaged straddle position. Thus, when a trader is buying a MOVE contract, they are essentially buying a call and a put option with the same strike and in equal amount. Cboe has an index called the Volatility Index, or VIX, which is also known as the fear index. The reason the VIX is called a fear index is because its value rises when market uncertainty or fear is high and falls when the market is calm. Investors can’t directly invest in the VIX, but they can bet on the VIX going up or down by trading futures on the VIX or by purchasing VIX-related products such as VIX futures exchange-traded funds. In cryptocurrency markets, trading MOVE contracts is the equivalent of trading VIX products, as it gives investors pure exposure to the volatility of crypto.Another important aspect of any derivatives product is the settlement currency — i.e., the currency in which the final profit or loss is realized. The default settlement currency for most crypto derivatives products is Bitcoin. This is understandable, given that when the crypto derivatives ecosystem was starting, stablecoins were still not commonplace. Thus, products that allowed payoff in Bitcoin or other cryptos were innovated. This was also partly driven by customer demand, as traders focused on increasing their count of Bitcoin. Things have changed a lot in the last 12 months, and we’ve seen a strong demand for stablecoin settlement in the crypto derivatives segment. Other ways to combat a volatile market include switching to low-risk assets such as gold.  Futures contracts on gold-backed coins have provided crypto traders with a way to protect their portfolio value in times of widespread uncertainty. These derivatives have also opened a new sector of trading that allows crypto traders access to physical gold. They have been in high demand on many derivatives exchanges because of the recent gold price spike in the backdrop of the coronavirus scare and global markets sell-off.Futures contracts on stablecoins are also getting popular, as there are arbitrage opportunities for traders to earn profit in a stable token’s value while taking minimal risk. Overall, the industry has seen a surging demand for a stable digital currency amid fears of an economic recession and will continue to rely on stablecoins as a safe haven.Derivatives provide a way for traders to hedge in times of high market uncertainty, isolate and protect against different kinds of risks, and aid in true price discovery. In the long run, a healthy derivatives market helps to reduce the long-term volatility of an asset class.The crypto derivatives segment has seen huge growth in the last two years, but we’ve only scratched the surface as of yet. For mature asset classes, derivatives markets are four to five times the size of spot markets. Currently, Bitcoin perpetual swaps make for the lion’s share of the crypto derivatives segment. As crypto derivatives markets grow, we will see increased demand to trade futures on other coins beyond Bitcoin and for options, as they provide a way for traders to manage volatility risk.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

offer a shorter time-frame, ranging from 10 minutes to one day.",,"Major crypto exchange Binance claims to have become the largest options venue in the cryptocurrency market, having hit $295 million in traded volume as of April 20.","In an interview with Cointelegraph on April 23, the vice president of Binance Futures, Aaron Gong, said that the platform had overtaken its counterparts by daily traded volume on April 14 — just one day after its official launch.  Gong explained that the contract had been designed to tackle what Binance perceived to be the key drawbacks of existing crypto options products — low liquidity, high premiums and large spread.An options contract offers traders the chance to purchase either a right to buy (a “call option”) or sell (a “put option”) on a given asset at a specified “strike price.” Gong noted that existing crypto options on the market typically offer a wide range of expiration dates and strike prices, including long-term durations that can extend up to 100 days and even longer. He said:“This market structure creates a fragmented liquidity landscape, where contracts that are far out-of-the-money and furthest away from the expiration date are notoriously illiquid. As such, trading with those contracts may pose challenges to transaction costs and trade execution.”Binance’s Bitcoin (BTC)/Tether (USDT) options contracts are designed to offer a shorter time-frame, ranging from 10 minutes to one day. Moreover, Binance itself is the primary liquidity provider of the product, meaning that the options have an uncapped supply and users will have quotations at any given time.Gong said that the contract is a simplified version of traditional options and is catered to retail users specifically, with the aim of lowering barriers to entry for derivatives trading. The exchange has chosen to offer the American, as opposed to the European, version of options, in which traders can settle the contract at the chosen strike price at any time before — and including — the expiry date itself.Gong gave a concrete example of how an options contract works, outlining that:“If a buyer buys a Binance Call option with a strike price of $7,000 and a premium of $100, the breakeven price will be $7,100 - the sum of the strike price and premium. To exit the trade profitably, the underlying asset should move beyond $7,100 [...] Conversely, if the underlying asset fails to move beyond the breakeven price at expiry, the option will expire worthless.”He noted that, in this example, if the price of the underlying asset reaches $7,200, the buyer would pocket a net profit of $100 — a 100% return on investment (ROI). If the price of the underlying asset reaches $7,300, the buyer would have a net profit of $200, or a 200% ROI. In the immediate future, Gong added that derivatives like futures and options could prove to be a useful hedging tool, not only for retail and institutional investors but also for miners who are facing intense economic pressure ahead of the May 2020 Bitcoin halving."

This is an increase of 314% from the 2019 Q4 average.,"According to the “2020 Q1 Cryptocurrency Derivatives Exchange Industry Report”, except for a slight decline in Q4 2019, the trading volume of cryptocurrency futures grew in 2019. The total market turnover in Q1 2020 is roughly eight times than Q1 2019.For trading volume analysis, TokenInsight included BitMEX, OKEx, Huobi DM, Binance Futures, Deribit, Bitget, Binance JEX, FTX, Gate.io, BFX.NU, BitZ, and KuMEX, in addition to some emerging derivatives exchanges.The average daily trading volume of the whole market during the first quarter of 2020 hit $23.3 billion. This represents an increase of 274% from 2019.Researchers who were in charge of preparing the report commented on the following:“We believe the cryptocurrency futures have already possessed some attributes of market-leading indicators, and spot market participants can refer to futures trading volume for position management.”The study also highlights that the correlation coefficient between futures and spot trading volume fell to 0.31. This is compared to the 0.76 registered in the fourth quarter of 2019. Researchers concluded that this phenomenon explains that futures market participants “may have been relatively independent” from the spot.When the futures market is abnormally traded, the study highlights that the spot market is exposed to significant fluctuations.Following the same line, the report states:“At this time, investors need to adjust their positions. Besides, in the market downturn, only when the future volume finally shrinks, the market may experience a meaningful rebound.”A study quoted by Cointelegraph on April 21 reported that Binance Futures emerged as the biggest winner in the futures market, following the Black Thursday sell-off.At that time, Binance reached $2.8 billion in just 24 hours of Bitcoin futures volumes. Their results surpassed that of both BitMEX ($2.1B) and Huobi ($2.46b).According to data provided by Coin Metrics, Binance Futures’ Bitcoin (BTC) open interest share jumped from about 10% in mid-March to nearly 25% by April 12."

periods of helicopter money, so Indians may have an opportunity to turn ...",,"In one of 2020’s biggest stories about cryptocurrencies so far, the Indian Supreme Court struck down a blanket ban on trading cryptocurrencies issued by the Reserve Bank of India earlier in the year. Then, March happened, and everything changed as COVID-19 spread around the world, inducing quarantines across the world and stoking unprecedented volatility in financial markets.","India is now in a national 21-day lockdown with industries shuttered and strict enforcement doled out by the government. Following similar initiatives by other countries affected by the viral pandemic, the COVID-19 fallout changes the narrative of the Supreme Court ruling — fomenting a distinct uncertainty about the future of fiat money globally.The United States government has passed a $2-trillion fiscal stimulus package, and the total — including the Federal Reserve’s standing lending facility of $4.25 trillion at the discretion of the Treasury Department — equates to more than $6 trillion flooding the global economy, which is roughly 28% of the U.S. gross domestic product for 2019.The sheer scale of the Fed’s response to the COVID-19 crisis is both unprecedented and causing ripple effects around the world as the U.S. dollar functions as the world’s reserve currency. Other countries, primarily G-7 countries, have even begun ramping up fiscal and monetary stimulus of their own.Naturally, the deluge of money into the global economy raises questions about the origin of its value, which the Fed would tell you is just adjusting a few digits on its balance sheet. However, crypto enthusiasts have a more keen eye for the potential impact of unfettered money creation.Whether the current bonanza of cash will lead to a cost-push inflationary environment is yet to be determined, as the floodgates first have to temper the current deflationary situation as USD demand surges. Meanwhile, in the context of India, a country whose monetary policy is whimsical at best, the coupling of the Supreme Court’s ruling with the current situation has bred significant uncertainty.Putting aside the COVID-19 and lockdown fiasco for a moment, the Indian Supreme Court’s move was celebrated across the industry as a turning point for the world’s largest software exporter and home to more than 1.3 billion people.The implications for the broader industry are tangible, and opening the floodgates to India’s booming tech-savvy market should help push the needle of crypto adoption forward significantly.Numerous Indian-based crypto exchanges had already resumed fiat services before the crisis, and some observers believed the move would spark crypto financing opportunities in a previously arid Indian finance market for blockchain tech. That will assuredly change, pending the outcome of the next few months, but it’s important to keep in mind.Indian-based blockchain projects, such as Matic Network, viewed the regulatory move as a compelling opportunity to showcase India’s push for crypto adoption. Additionally, many crypto projects have squandered their financial runways, whether from initial coin offerings or initial exchange offerings, meaning that sound money management of projects is now at a premium.In particular, Matic Network has been focusing on the long-term picture, saving for the back-end of the current COVID-19 dilemma, when hopefully, the brightening Indian regulatory environment will continue.I reached out to the company before the crisis to help provide insight into India’s push for such adoption. “Despite much of the hype for blockchain technology, the adoption of most platforms is woefully lacking,” said Sandeep Nailwal, the chief operating officer and co-founder of Matic, during our conversation. “Now that we have more developed underlying technology for the industry, paired with a warming regulatory environment, this is the opportunity to capitalize on adoption.”While the situation is different today, Nailwal’s comments translate well into the new reality facing the crypto sector and the broader global financial system.It’s no secret that crypto user adoption numbers are waning. Pure DApps — those that operate on a public blockchain network — fail to attract any meaningful adoption when compared to traditional applications.According to MakerDAO, the darling of Ethereum’s DeFi push, has a 24-hour peak user number just under 13K. Compared to surging financial apps like Robinhood, with millions of users, the numbers indicate a major hurdle left for the crypto industry.The near-collapse of MakerDAO following the S&P 500’s tumble off a cliff also hasn’t done any favors for people exploring DeFi as a legitimate avenue for investing or credit instruments, though. The metrics have not been lost in the crypto community. Poor UX/UI, significant onboarding friction, the complex learning curve of crypto and a lack of developer tools have all hindered user growth for many of crypto’s leading applications — not to mention the more obscure ones.Then the COVID-19 pandemic happened.From a macro perspective, the implications of India’s lockdown are manifold.India reportedly sources 80% of the raw materials for pharmaceutical drugs from China, which the U.S. relies on to meet medical demands, which are swelling right now. Additionally, India’s government is mulling a 1.5-trillion-rupee ($19.6 billion) stimulus package amid the COVID-19 pandemic. That’s a highly conservative figure at best and likely to change considering they are only projecting to shave two points off its GDP projections for 2020, while JP Morgan is forecasting a minus 14% for Q2 in the U.S. India already has much higher annual inflation than the U.S. and many G-7 countries, which means that it needs to carefully consider the impact of a Fed bazooka — similar to what the U.S. did. After eliminating 86% of cash overnight only a few years ago, trust in the Indian government’s monetary policy is likely not very high.The opportunity for crypto to make a splash in India has never been more appealing, especially with the recent Supreme Court ruling inspiring some hopeful innovation.However, the problem of crypto adoption remains tough. Bitcoin’s (BTC) volatility doesn’t make it an ideal stability option during periods of helicopter money, so Indians may have an opportunity to turn to stablecoins, which, according to Coin Metrics, have been surging in supply to meet growing demand.“Distinct changes are coming in finance — e.g., DeFi — social media, identity and gaming centering on areas from privacy to data and digital property. Blockchain will be the main driving force behind this revolutionary disruption,” said Nailwal. “Crypto may provide a release valve for people trying to salvage value, tap into foreign currencies, or function as an intermediary vehicle for goods or services exchanges.”Nailwal’s sentiment is reflected by recent research from The Open Money Initiative, which indicated that Bitcoin and other crypto-assets are widely used in South America as ways to circumvent capital controls or function as an intermediary for exchanging local currencies.Now, it’s just a matter of reducing the barriers of entry to showcase the possibilities of crypto applications. That entails a significantly improved user experience, however, and the elimination of critical vulnerabilities like flash loans in DeFi lending pools. The censorship-resistance of DApps, their persistent uptime and privacy advantages during a crisis (see the EARN IT bill) could serve as vital anchors for people in distress. That reality may be far away, however. Nobody can predict how the next few months will play out, and if crypto adoption does begin to climb, it will likely be because it was forced out of necessity — which means that the financial, economic and viral pandemic situation will have only deteriorated by summer.The RBI’s position on cryptocurrencies for payments appears to remain volatile, too. COVID-19 is in the driver’s seat of the narrative now, and delayed government responses aren’t doing them any favors in the eyes of the public.A few years ago, the notion of a warming regulatory environment in India seemed far-fetched. The Supreme Court’s ruling altered that dynamic and stoked excitement for projects like Matic and others looking to spearhead the Indian crypto and blockchain scene.COVID-19 then bludgeoned the global economy and has induced panic and volatility in financial markets, which will have unforeseen consequences on the global fiat system as we know it.Whether that boosts crypto’s preponderance in India is unpredictable, but at least the beginnings of a DApp ecosystem to let users tap into an alternative financial system are available now — and have some judicial approval underscoring the technology for now.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.Andrew Rossow is a millennial attorney, law professor, entrepreneur, writer and speaker on privacy, cybersecurity, AI, AR/VR, blockchain and digital currencies.

Discussing some of the differences between Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), Buterin explained why the team chose Proof of Stake as the upgraded consensus mechanism:","“One of the reasons why we’re doing Proof of Stake is because we want to greatly reduce the issuance. So in the specs for ETH 2.0 I think we have put out a calculation that the theoretical maximum issuance would be something like 2 million a year if literally everyone participates.”He said the current testnet participation sees around 100,000 ETH issued a year. The current Ethereum network has about 4.7 million ETH issued annually. Eth 2.0 issuance meanwhile is expected to be somewhere between 100,000 and 2 million a year, with the most likely scenario being that it will be much less than 2 million.Buterin also mentioned that the total circulating supply could see a net reduction at times of high transaction volumes due to a portion of each fee being burnt. “There is this base fee parameter which the protocol charges” he said, explaining that when you send a transaction the transaction fee is broken into two parts — the first goes to the miner as a ‘tip’, while the other portion simply gets burnt.Another key upgrade to the Ethereum network is the adjustment of block sizes rather than fees in response to network activity. “Instead of having volatility in transaction fees, we have volatility in block size,” he said.  This will help reduce some of the issues users currently face such as difficulty in predicting a transaction’s optimal fee amount and excessive processing times.Support continues to grow for the testnet with news this week that a major mining pool run by OKEx will join the ETH 2.0 testnet Topaz as a validator. The testnet currently has 24,000 active validators and reached more than 20,000 validators in four days."

innovations in blockchain technology are quietly shifting the paradigm 
of ...",,"Gold’s history as a symbol of value dwarfs that of any other artifact. Used as money in both ancient Greece and the Roman empire, gold was also the preferred method of payment for goods along the Silk Road. When modern banking emerged during the Italian Renaissance, the concept of paper money convertible into gold was invented. This practice ended a half-century ago, but the value of gold remains timeless.","Starting with England in 1717, modern nations began anchoring their national systems of money to gold in what became known as the “gold standard.” By the late 1800s, and until World War I, the most advanced economies were united in this approach. Today, although the money of nations is no longer anchored to it in any way, gold has retained considerable economic utility. Whether used to preserve savings or as a hedge against financial instability, gold has been a mainstay in individual, institutional and state portfolios.In spite of this storied history and the clear economic utility of a scarce asset, gold ownership remains challenging. Unlike fiat money in bank accounts or financial assets in investment accounts, stores of gold must be physically safeguarded against theft. As these volumes of stored gold increase, incentives for theft also rise, pushing the cost of secure custody higher. Another challenge is transportability. Theft must also be physically guarded against during transit, but eliminating this risk can be prohibitively expensive. Not everyone can afford an armored Brinks truck.More challenges arise at the transactional level where the gold must be both verified for its authenticity and denominated in such quantities as to suit both the buyer and seller. Due to the high costs of purity testing and the difficulties of dividing physical gold, these constraints dramatically lower the potential for voluntary transactions between buyers and sellers. The potential for lower-value transactions suffers the most, as these buyers and sellers typically cannot rely on economies of scale to offset transaction costs. They may also prefer to use smaller and more precise denominations than the antiquated “gold bar.”Together, these challenges create significant friction for both buyers and sellers of physical gold. These hurdles can be especially discouraging for smaller investors who may be dissuaded from ownership of the physical asset altogether. Popular gold-based financial products such as Exchange-Traded Funds, or ETFs, might then be used to gain some exposure, but this is not an economic equivalent to physical gold ownership.Despite the challenges associated with physical ownership, gold markets continue to be among the most liquid in the world. Much like the geological deposits of this shiny metal, the demand for physical gold ownership is widely dispersed around the globe. The desirability of gold jewelry is universal, but so is the need to protect oneself from currency debasement and other financial turbulence. In countries where currencies are known to depreciate rapidly, it is far more common for citizens to hold their savings in physical gold rather than as money in a bank account. Just weeks ago, amid the COVID-19 crisis, long lines could be seen forming outside of Bangkok gold shops as residents queued to sell their gold.Because of work stoppages brought on by the health crisis, many Thai nationals sought to convert some of their savings into much-needed cash. The eight-year high Thai baht price of gold made this an especially attractive option and highlights the ultimate purpose of owning gold: exposure to the spot price of physical gold in terms of one’s own fiat currency. Whether it is a Thai shopkeeper protecting their savings, or a global hedge fund executing a complex investment strategy, the economic purpose of owning physical gold is the same: exposure.The days of waiting in line to buy or sell gold may soon be over. While Bitcoin (BTC) has been heralded as “digital gold,” related innovations in blockchain technology are quietly shifting the paradigm of physical gold ownership. By leveraging this new technology, Tether Gold (XAUT) and other gold-backed stablecoins are fulfilling the economic purpose of physical gold ownership while overcoming many of the traditionally associated challenges. With a quickly growing market cap of approximately $86 million, XAUT has eclipsed PAX Gold (PAXG) to become the most widely held and circulated gold-backed stablecoin.By embedding legal title to specific allocations of authenticated physical gold into a digital token, this highly innovative class of products combines the best of three distinct worlds: (1) Direct exposure to the price of physical gold. (2) The cost-efficiency and accessibility of traditional financial assets, such as ETFs.(3) The transactional utility of a digital token.Before gold-backed stablecoins, only the largest investors could avoid making stark trade-offs between (1) and (2) above. Everyone wants direct exposure to the price of physical gold, but at what cost? From the burden of securing physical storage and transportation to the added friction of purity-testing and low divisibility, it is easy to see how direct exposure has become prohibitively expensive for most investors. Unable to harness economies of scale, these investors are then priced out of physical ownership and priced into a synthetic proxy.But margarine is not butter. Without traceable allocation to specific, authenticated and securely vaulted physical gold, these synthetic gold-based financial products can never amount to the real thing, no matter how popular they become. Today, through technical innovation and legal design, gold-backed stablecoins have been working to harness economies of scale for everyone. Now, for the first time in gold’s long history, investors can gain direct exposure to the price of physical gold without having to overcome the traditional associated costs and challenges. Physical ownership has been democratized.The benefits of gold-backed stablecoins extend well beyond the gains for individual buyers and sellers. The market as a whole is affected. John Bogle’s 1975 launch of the first index fund offered a similar value proposition to investors: democratization of diversified equity market exposure. Recognizing that the performance of actively-managed mutual funds could not justify their high fees, Bogle set out to offer low-cost, passive investment products by replicating the market at scale. These products’ popularity exploded in the ensuing decades, as individual investors began to recognize how much money Bogle’s invention could save them.Despite these clear gains for individual investors, the long term impact of index funds on global equity markets has been ambiguous at best, and likely destructive. With passive investing strategies having grown to represent an ever-greater share of market activity, the proliferation of these index products has raised fundamental concerns over liquidity and price discovery within equities markets. Bogle himself recognized this problem later in his career, as he worried that the explosion of passive investing had opened the door to manipulation from speculators. Having designed index funds for long-term investors, Bogle remained dismayed into his final days by the speculative turn that the now-massive ETF industry had taken. Warren Buffet has described Bogle as the man “who has done the most for American investors,” but the jury is still out on what passive investing has done to American equity markets, something Bogel himself recognized.Gold-backed stablecoins have flipped this story on its head. Cost-efficient ownership of physical gold has certainly been democratized but in a way that supports the long-term liquidity and price discovery within global gold markets. Whereas the growth of passive investment flows, as recognized by Bogle, would increase the susceptibility of equity markets to manipulation, the growth of gold-backed stablecoins would have the opposite effect. Since today’s gold markets are already dominated by “paper” — financial instruments with no direct connection to specific allocations of physical gold — the functioning and integrity of these markets can only improve as gold-backed stablecoins gain prominence.With myriad advantages from both the individual and collective standpoints, gold-backed stablecoins really do allow the investing world to have its cake and eat it too.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

The release of the data is embarrassing for City officials who claimed that no private data from its 145,000 residents had been compromised in the attack. To prove it had, the group set up a site called “Dopple Leaks” with a sample of the hacked files, including city budget financials, accounting, and other documents belonging to the City Manager of Torrance.The StateScoop website reports it has examined the files and uncovered individuals’ names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, and other personal identifying information, as well as 181 pages of financial transactions that occurred in the 2019 fiscal year.Despite Torrance’s fate, a recent report by malware lab Emsisoft showed that there was a significant drop in the number of successful ransomware attacks on the U.S. public sector for Q1 2020, partially due to more employees being forced to work remotely.Emsisoft threat analyst Brett Callow told Cointelegraph:“...it’s very obvious to ransomware attackers that they’ve got a potentially valuable target when they hit a corporate endpoint. It may however be less obvious when they hit a personal device that an employee is using while working remotely, and which is only connected to corporate resources on an intermittent basis. “The Emsisoft report, however, also mentioned that ransomware attacks can be seasonal. The recent overall drop should not be a sign of complacency. An FBI report stated that victims paid roughly $144 million in BTC to ransomware hackers between October 2013 and November 2019. As many attacks go unreported, this is likely an underestimate."

However, it took the form of ransomware to make various changes to the device and install malicious applications.As usual with ransomware attacks, Lucy encrypts files on the infected device and displays a fake FBI warning, accusing the victim of possessing pornographic content on their devices.The message also states that the details of the targeted user have been uploaded to the FBI Cyber Crime Department's Data Center and lists a series of bogus charges brought against them.The fine is $500, but it must be paid via credit card instead of Bitcoin, as ransomware attacks usually operate.Speaking with Cointelegraph, Brett Callow, threat analyst at Emsisoft, said he doesn’t believe that mobile platforms are a target for serious ransomware groups: “It’s simply not where the money is at. While an attack on corporate endpoints and servers can bring a company to a standstill and enable the criminals to extort a significant ransom, the same cannot be said for an attack on mobile devices.”Callow adds the following comment on the fact that ransomware attacks, like Lucy, accept credit card payment:“The fact that these low-level sextortion scammers are seemingly transacting via credit card rather than Bitcoin is unusual but not a particularly significant development. I certainly wouldn’t expect to see any of the real ransomware groups adopting the strategy.”The cybersecurity firm says that Lucy uses an ""ingenious"" method to circumvent Android security, displaying a message asking the user to activate real-time video optimization.As a next step, the cybercriminals persuade the victim to give malware permission to use the accessibility function in Android.Cointelegraph reported on April 21 about a publication from Emsisoft lab malware that highlighted that there was a significant drop in the number of successful ransomware attacks on the public sector during Q1 2020, despite the COVID-19 crisis."

At the moment, the country is mostly emphasizing [...] industrial and business applications of DLT. “Still, Plantonov admitted that the recent measures taken by Chinese officials are “ probably the first time since 2018 when the local administration directly supports blockchain mining during high-flow seasons.” He explained that the change was initiated by Chinese President Xi Jinping’s call for the country to accelerate the adoption of blockchain technology:“After the October announcement, which put forward blockchain as a national focus of innovation, the technology has been penetrating different layers of the Chinese government.”Plantonov explained that Sichuan “has been a mining powerhouse for years”. He states that the region is economically underdeveloped, but has a lot of natural resources. Because of this, he believes crypto mining to be a great opportunity for the province:“Mining is somewhat of a 'gold mine' opportunity they don't want to miss. Now, under the blockchain-friendly climate provided by the central government, the pain points in the field are expected to be solved and the market is likely to be expanding gradually.”Lastly, while Plantonov admitted that mining is clearly a part of blockchain technology, he believes it will still see conflicts with the local administration over the next few years:“As the two (blockchain technology and mining) always go hand-in-hand, the sphere is projected to remain vulnerable over the next few years, with a certain amount of conflicts around this issue.”China is a major player in the cryptocurrency mining industry. A late 2019 report showed that Chinese Bitcoin miners at the time were responsible for as much as 66% of the global hash rate, with 54% coming from just Sichuan.As Cointelegraph reported earlier today, Chinese cryptocurrency mining hardware producer, Bitmain, earned over $300 million in profit in the first four months of 2020."

The company would emerge as one of the few Bitcoin (BTC) exchanges to gain traction during the infancy of cryptocurrency — raising $1.5 million in a fundraising round led by Winklevoss Capital Management.In January 2014, Shrem was arrested on suspicions of conspiring to launder $1 million, and was sentenced to two years in prison in December 2014 after pleading guilty to the reduced charge of aiding and abetting unlicensed money transmission.In May 2014, Shrem received a mysterious letter from someone named ‘Marcel Mellish’. The letter was later published on Two-Bit-Idiot’s blog.Shrem wrote that some of the individuals he shared the letter with had “suggested an underlying message, possibly a private key, or someone reaching out.”The letter appears to erratically use intentionally misspelled Yiddish words, and features quirks in its writing conventions and formatting. The letter was also printed on yellow paper — which Charlie believed was employed to evade automated letter scanning systems.When asked if there has been any update to the story of Marcel Mellish since 2017, Shrem revealed to Cointelegraph that he received a curious breadcrumb in the story back in Feb 2017.“I got a weird email from someone completely unrelated [to] Bitcoin, a person who owns a restaurant in like Chicago or something that said he got a letter from a Marcel Mellish as well.

The token is pegged 1:1 to Bitcoin and is compatible with the Ethereum (ETH) and EOS DeFi ecosystems to date.Bitfinex CTO, Paolo Ardoino, told Cointelegraph that the platform expects to add support for pBTC deposits and withdrawals by the end of May 2020. Ardoino elaborated that pBTC will become the first DeFi interoperability-focused token supported on Bitfinex.He said:“At the moment we are supporting only pTokens but we welcome more projects to work with us to make it easier for our users to obtain access to cross-chain liquidity.”Ardoino previously endorsed the pTokens project in late December 2019, predicting that cross-chain value transfers would be the most critical issue facing the cryptocurrency sector in 2020.Thomas Bertani, founder of Provable Things, the main development team behind the pTokens project, said that pTokens’ integration with Bitfinex streamlines the flow of liquidity between centralized and decentralized exchanges. Bertani added that the listing facilitates an easy token switch and creates a new gateway for BTC liquidity to stream into the DeFi ecosystem. As of press time, pBTC is only trading on two markets — Kyber Network and Bancor Network — according to data from Coingecko.Listing pBTC on Bitfinex comes in conjunction with pTokens launching an interoperability solution. Thanks to this new release, Bitcoin users are now able to use pBTC in both the Ethereum and EOS ecosystems. pBTC was brought onto the Ethereum network back in March 2020. Bertani pointed out that DeFi applications have to be interconnected to contribute to the entire DeFi industry growth:“Decentralized applications today must interoperate and complement each other like lego blocks in order for the entire DeFi industry to scale. This interoperability is vital for the movement, as liquidity is the catalyst which will help DeFi reach its true potential.”Bertani also added that the firm is actively working on other pTokens, including pETH, pEOS, pLTC and pDAI:“New pTokens such as pEOS and pLTC have already been deployed in a test environment and will also soon be available on Ethereum mainnet. The same will apply to other assets, bringing pETH and pDAI to EOS.”While the majority of the DeFi lending solutions integrate Bitcoin via Ethereum, pBTC’s launch on the EOS DeFi introduces Bitcoin as collateral for EOS stablecoins. As part of the initiative, pBTC will integrate with major decentralized EOS stablecoin, EOSDT. Developed by multi-chain DeFi framework Equilibrium, EOSDT will become one of the few Bitcoin-integrated EOS DeFi solutions. It will act as a new DeFi tool to provide the stable collateralization of pBTC.Equilibrium appears to be one of few established firms that bring Bitcoin to EOS DeFi lending. The EOSDT project positions itself as the first solution to provide Bitcoin-EOS integration, Equilibrium’s CEO and co-founder, Alex Melikhov, said. Melikhov added that the pBTC integration with EOSDT is scheduled for next week.When a technical issue at MakerDAO triggered millions of dollars-worth loan failures in March, pTokens’ Bertani said that the industry needs new solutions like EOSDT.Bertani said:“The crypto industry has learned some hard lessons from the latest market falls. We can all agree that stablecoins have proved to be far less “stable” than we first imagined, with recent events like the MakerDAO debt auction exposing some hidden architectural flaws. New solutions are needed to guarantee the stable collateralization of these digital assets like DAI and EOSDT.”The news comes after Chinese lending platform, Lendf.me, part of the dForce network, suffered a $25 million hack on April 19. The hacker subsequently returned the stolen money as of April 22 after potentially exposing their own identity data."

highest exceeded $13,000. Especially in the past three months, the ...",,"Jay Hao, the CEO of the digital asset exchange OKEx, took part in Cointelegraph China HUB, an online interview column, hosted by Vadim Krekotin, co-founder and CEO of Cointelegraph China and Kristina Lucrezia Cornèr, managing editor of Cointelegraph. Hao has recently stated in an AMA that blockchain will eliminate transaction barriers, improve efficiency and ultimately impact the development of the global economy. But what does he think about the world of blockchain now?","Vadim Krekotin: As you said, the cryptocurrency industry itself brims with uncertainties, and it is OKEx's innate mission to be prepared to meet new challenges on all occasions. In the past year, the lowest price of Bitcoin reached about $3,300 and the highest exceeded $13,000. Especially in the past three months, the global financial industry has encountered massive fluctuations under the influence of COVID-19. 24/7 free-to-trade cryptocurrency has reacted even more in this plunge. “For exchanges, the biggest challenge brought by such huge fluctuations is the stability of the trading system and risk control under such extreme market behavior.”So, my team and I have consistently held a consensus: in the world of cryptocurrency, technology strength must be the key to building any crypto ecosystem. In the past year, we have polished the construction of the system without stopping, and we have carried out hundreds of significant upgrades. Our unique super matching engine and Lightning 2.0 system ensure that the platform can run stable even under extreme market conditions, and also the order processing speed has ranked high on the world's top options exchanges lists. This is indeed a matter of pride.VK: Can you give some details about OKEx’s expansion plan or overall strategy?JH: From my point of view, reputation is the foundation of an enterprise, especially in the crypto world. In addition to the well-known reasons why Libra's issuance is so complicated, I think there is another factor. Business lies happen once or countless times. After all, a lie requires countless lies to make up for it, and the vicious cycle will always collapse.As Facebook is one of the main sponsors, it was bothered with problems such as user data leakage and unauthorized collection of user data, which have seriously hurt market confidence. Lawmakers' distrust of Facebook even exceeds that of cryptocurrency itself or blockchain technology. “Therefore, within OKEx, I repeatedly stress with the team that we must never do anything that harms the interests of users. ‘Customer first’ is always the core value of OKEx, which also acts as the cornerstone of our internationalization.”The internationalization of OKEx has been accelerating. At present, it has reached cooperation with the world's seven largest legal fiat payment providers through the fiat gateway project, supported 30 fiat currencies including United States dollars and euros, and accepts 17 payment methods including Visa and Mastercard. Also, we have provided services to more than 20 million users in more than 200 countries and regions around the world, and that is still increasing.In the crypto world, OKEx’s role is not only as a trading platform but also a blockchain technology company. We have launched OKEx Cloud, relying on the technical strength and service experience accumulated by OKEx in the field of digital assets for many years and providing exchange technology services to the world. Besides, OKChain, independently developed by OKEx, was also completed as 100% open-source. OKChain pioneered the ""commercial chain alliance"" model, which will face all ecological nodes and provide efficient, free and boundless public chain ecosystems. It is a significant step for our internationalization.In summary, OKEx’s internationalization has three points: first, customers come first; second, to meet global differentiated needs and provide localized services; and third, we are not building an exchange, but a global free, equal and healthy encryption ecosystem.VK: According to CryptoCompare, the combined volumes of OKEx’s, BitMEX’s, Huobi’s and Binance’s derivatives markets in March totaled $514 billion, or 86% of the entire market. And OKEx took more than BitMEX. How do you see the competition in the market? JH: In the face of competition, I always believe that continuous and healthy competition will bring new vitality into the market. While promoting the progress of the industry, it also allows users to have a better reference basis when choosing a trading platform. We will actively learn from excellent competitors. After all, the beneficiaries under healthy competition will always be users.Can a contract dominate the competitiveness and fate of an exchange? The answer is, of course, no. No company can be popular in the world with only one function. The needs of users are constantly changing. In the business environment, the only constant is change. What's more, in a new and rapidly changing industry like blockchain, I always believe that OKEx's biggest competitor is ourselves, and we are also confident that we will continue to lead the industry and make breakthroughs.VK: How does OKEx address challenges such as cryptojacking or the free-fall of the market such as occurred on March 12?JH: As I said before, technical security is still one of the biggest challenges that trading platforms need to face. I can proudly tell you that because of OKEx's excellent technical strength, there has never been a theft of user funds or an information security incident since its establishment. In terms of fund management, OKEx adopts enhanced cold/hot wallet management, and the risk control system is continuously upgraded to ensure the safety of user funds and information.Due to the particularity of the industry, the order volume per second in extreme market conditions is several times higher than the normal order volume and can reach 1 million. This is indeed an objective challenge for all exchanges in the industry.On the other hand, service solutions from the perspective of user interests are also particularly important. For the user losses caused by our platform in the extreme market on March 12, we immediately set up a special solution group to actively follow up and solve the problems, which has also been understood and supported by most users. As an objectively neutral and responsible trading platform, we are well aware that there are still many areas that need to be improved. VK: It can be said that OKB is not only a platform coin for OKEx, but also a global token throughout the entire ecosystem of OKEx. What’s the role of OKB in OKEx’s ecosystem?JH: Now, in many people's eyes, OKB is less and less like a ""platform token."" It creates continuous value for OKEx users. OKB ecological construction starts from several important dimensions, and its ultimate goal is to continue to create value for users.In terms of additional rights within the OKEx trading platform, 14 application scenarios have been expanded. From the perspective of the construction of a deflation model, we are currently the first platform coin in the industry to achieve full circulation. On Feb. 10, we destroyed 700 million unissued OKB, which means that the team completely gave up its rights and holdings of OKB, and the profits were given to OKB users. Of course, this also means that OKB's future buyback and burn will all be performed in the secondary market.VK: Can you tell us how OKChain will empower OKB in the future?JH: The appearance of OKChain is also an attempt of OKEx in the global decentralization tide. The big difference is that OKChain will solve the problem of large-scale landing and application of public chains because we believe this is the main contradiction in the current development of public chains.OKChain's uniquely designed cross-chain solution and original business chain alliance can enable each participating node to exert its power here and publish and run various decentralized applications without hindrance. The whole process does not require any review nor is there a so-called ""proposal."" To a large extent, it has solved a series of problems such as transactions per second, security and adaptability that plagued the development of public chain technology.In the future, OKB will be migrated to the main chain of OKChain. At that time, we will delete the code of the smart contract for the additional issuance of tokens and continue to improve the OKB deflation model. And the genesis block of OKChain's basic token OKT will map 100% to OKB holders when the mainnet goes online, and OKB holders will also have the opportunity to become supernodes on OKChain.The latest progress is that when it was open-sourced to GitHub, OKChain joined hands with the first group of ecological partners — a total of 30 global well-known enterprises from the public chain, proof-of-stake mining pool, blockchain browser, wallet and multiple other types of fields. Perhaps by that time, OKB will be less like a ""platform token.""VK: How do you see the regulatory landscape around crypto, and how does OKEx remain compliant with global regulators?JH: I was not surprised by the result of the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission's ban on Telegram tokens. Telegram is elaborating on the nature of its tokens, saying that Telegram Open Network is a practical tool for community members with ""consumer uses,"" while the SEC and the courts are more concerned about its financial attributes, believing that it can flow out of control to the secondary market. Such negotiations are doomed to a consensus.“The supervision of any industry always needs to dynamically adapt to market changes, but a basic premise is that no matter how changes are made, everyone has a basic consensus on this industry.”The TON ban does not completely represent the SEC’s denial of the entire digital currency. On the contrary, this judgement fully shows us the professional understanding of the SEC and the courts on blockchain technology and digital currency, which is a powerful impetus for the development of the entire crypto industry. In the globalization process of OKEx, it is our primary premise to reach a regulatory consensus with local users and regulatory agencies.In March, we heard a lot of good news from the world: India lifted the trading ban, South Korea officially classified cryptocurrencies as an asset and Germany issued a guide to classify cryptocurrencies as a financial instrument, with many other countries also actively exploring.This just shows that the regulatory agencies of various countries are reaching a consensus with the crypto market. Therefore, for any country and region in the world that has reached a consensus with the crypto world, OKEx is ready to embrace supervision at any time.Kristina Lucrezia Cornèr: Could you share your thoughts on Binance's acquisition of CoinMarketCap? What were the main motivations behind this move, in your opinion? Is expansion like this a natural way for exchanges to develop?JH：First of all, congratulations to Binance on its ecological footprint expansion. However, I have also expressed my view on social media. In contrast, I would be more inclined to spend this budget on repurchasing platform coins and giving back to users who support the development of the platform. Only when users benefit will more and more people pay attention to and support you, and the exchange ecology will naturally become stronger and stronger.“Each exchange has its expansion strategy. There is no so-called natural occurrence. It is a trade-off between the interests of all parties. The final choice is also determined by the operator's judgment on the interests.”Although I have said it many times, I still have to reiterate that in the expansion of OKEx, the interests of OKEx users will always be first. It does not exclude that we will advance some important decisions by soliciting opinions from users. OKEx will continue to contribute its strength to the construction of the global crypto ecosystem, which is beyond doubt.KLC: Can you share what your favorite books are, those that have inspired you to do what you’ve been doing in the blockchain sector?JH：Work and life are two mirrors that reflect a person. I am quite different from myself at work. In addition to books that enhance professional knowledge every day, I like to read some tragic comedy and realism novels by Shakespeare and Dickens. I remember one sentence in Dickens's A Tale of Two Cities: “It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.” Now, in many moments, this sentence will appear in my heart. Any industry and its related technologies have two sides. This era has given us a great platform to do what we think is meaningful and at the same time set up many constraints. Therefore, our actions must be oriented to benefit the people, society and life. A good or bad thought requires that we always have a rule in our hearts to measure and correct. These novels have influenced my code of conduct to a certain extent.In addition to these, an avid teenager lives in my heart. Maybe you can't imagine it, but I also like to watch popular novels like ""Harry Potter"" and “Lord of the Rings."" I like a story that breaks the boundaries of thinking and uses imagination to create a world of dreams and love.Just like the blockchain industry, it is new, meaningful, borderless and does not adhere to conventions. We still have a lot of possibilities to achieve the impossible. Just like the enthusiasm brought by these novels, I think that whether it is a blockchain enterprise or a trading platform, we first need to use unlimited innovation and imagination to create services and value for society. At the same time, we must assess the situation, be bold and careful, and conduct within the rules of society.This interview was conducted during a partnered event. It has been condensed and edited."

Users can access deposit, exchange, and credit services using the popular digital currency.","Based in Switzerland, the bank will now allow the third most capitalized digital token behind Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) to be used by clients seeking to diversify their direct investments in digital tokens, in conjunction with other asset management products offered.Sygnum customers can use deposits in traditional currencies, such as the Swiss franc, the Euro, the Singapore dollar, and the US Dollar, to buy, hold and trade XRP tokens backed by the Ripple protocol.Additionally, customers can transfer XRP tokens to their Sygnum deposit account or increase their liquidity in traditional fiat currencies with a Lombard loan granted against XRP.Mathias Imbach, co-founder of Sygnum, praised the announcement and commented as follows:“We were impressed with Ripple’s excellent performance globally - they now have more than 300 financial institutions in their global payments network, RippleNet. The XRP-based solutions developed by the company resolve weak spots in the growing global remittance market of $ 700 billion. The low cost of transfers makes it an ideal tool to facilitate payments in emerging economies.”The bank also highlighted that the Ripple protocol provides instant cross-border transfers at a low cost, rather than the traditional way of sending money abroad.Sygnum’s customer assets are held in separate, highly secure individual portfolios. They are available in one click from each customer’s e-banking platform, and accessible anywhere in the world.It is not the first time that a bank incorporates Ripple’s protocol in its operations. Cointelegraph reported on April 10 that Azimo, a digital money service, partnered with Siam Commercial Bank in Thailand to launch an instant cross-border payment service through RippleNet.MoneyGram said in February that it received funds from the blockchain-based payments firm, Ripple Labs, to continue scaling the use of blockchain capabilities in its services."

By the end of this year, the firm plans to expand to over 30 African countries and provide a simple fiat on and off-ramp for crypto in the continent.Bundle supports Binance Coin (BNB), Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) as well as the local fiat currency — the Nigerian naira — but there are plans to add more fiat currencies in the coming weeks. Payments can be processed through cards, bank transfers and stored in the application’s wallet.The service will initially launch without fees, but Know Your Customer verification and fiat withdrawal and deposit limits will be applied. The mobile application is already available on the Google Play Android application store, and the iOS version will be published on Apple’s App Store in the coming weeks. No desktop version is currently supported.Bundle closed a pre-seed fundraise in September 2019, raising $450,000 from Binance. Yele Bademosi, the CEO and co-founder of Bundle, told Cointelegraph that Binance created a number of application programming interfaces useful for developers in the cryptocurrency industry, suggesting that the application may use some of them.Per the announcement, about 40% of banked Africans prefer to use online transaction systems and use advanced financial tools, partly because of the continent's low median age of 19. This young, tech-savvy population is the target of Bundle’s financial services. Bademosi said:“We built Bundle with the digitally native African user in mind. They are social, online, and connected across geographical boundaries. They prefer their financial services delivered digitally via mobile apps as opposed to visiting brick and mortar bank branches. We built Bundle as a mobile wallet that supports cash and crypto, and makes using crypto feel like just another digital financial transaction done on a mobile app like Venmo.”Bundle CTO Taiwo Orilogbon explained that Africa is fertile ground for cryptocurrency-based financial innovation, stating, “Currently, only 1.4 million people out of 1.2 billion people in Africa use crypto today. This is a worthwhile mission because making the blockchain ecosystem more accessible unlocks economic opportunity on and for the continent.”Hosting a number of developing countries, the African continent lacks a solid and well-developed financial infrastructure. While this has proven to be a major issue for local economic development so far, it also allows for faster innovation than in many developed countries. A recent Cointelegraph analysis explains how Africa is using those new technologies to drive change.As Cointelegraph reported in mid-April, cryptocurrency trading platform CryptoLocally is attempting to address the financial inequity in the African continent by partnering with payment platform Sesacash and providing innovative cross-border payment solutions."
137,https://cointelegraph.com,,Central Banks — A Bad Influence on Decentralized Finance,https://cointelegraph.com/news/central-banks-a-bad-influence-on-decentralized-finance,"The case I make below is simply that it is far more sensible to expand the 
function of base monies in the spirit of Bitcoin (BTC) than to ...",,"Philip Coggan, a British business journalist and news correspondent who writes for The Economist, once mentioned, “Modern money is debt and debt is money.” Few would disagree with this claim. Yes, the vast majority of money circulating today — so-called broad money — represents a specific type of credit–debt relationship.","This relationship is at the heart of today’s sovereign monetary authorities, the central banks under which almost all economic activity takes place. But the modern economic reality we have internalized is a breeding ground of confusion for innovators in the decentralized finance and broader crypto communities because it combines the roles of government and money implicitly.Left unexamined, this duality can be misleading for anyone trying to understand the design of independent monetary systems. And it is a mistake to view the modern central banking framework as a starting point for how to think about monetary blockchain protocols. The case I make below is simply that it is far more sensible to expand the function of base monies in the spirit of Bitcoin (BTC) than to “decentralize” central banks in the spirit of MakerDAO.More than half of a century ago, Harford Montgomery Hyde wrote in his book John Law: The History of an Honest Adventurer:“Someone mentioned the philosopher’s stone. To the surprise of all present, John Law said he had discovered it. ‘I can tell you my secret,’ said the financier. ‘It is to make gold out of paper.’”The debt instruments we see circulating as functional money today are the most effective monies ever created. But the true secret of Law’s paper is that it’s produced by banking systems with sovereign authority and therefore inherits sovereign responsibilities. For example, the United States Federal Reserve has the following stated mandates: maximize employment, maintain stable prices and uphold moderate long-term interest rates.This means people who are upset with losing their jobs, rapid price increases and expensive debt can assign some measure of blame to the agents behind modern money.Ultimately the central banking system we know and love is a flexible, discretionary instrument through which policymakers can support a body of people governed by a body of laws.Think of the central banking system as a “god mode” interface built for smart, well-meaning decisionmakers. And think of the Fed mandates as “reminder notes” pinned on the terminal.We should be grateful this system exists, moreover that it’s flexible and powerful enough for administrators to triage the economy though serious shocks like the one we’re currently experiencing.But my point is, none of the mechanisms made for this almighty administrator, nor its mandates, should be carried over to the design of independent monies without consideration.An independent money has no people for whom to maximize employment. Therefore it cannot fear getting carried away with low interest rates, nor can it fear price inflation incurred in the process of keeping employment rates up. Perhaps such an independent system should not require a “god mode” interface at all. But before we get ahead of ourselves, let’s first consider what the mandate of independent money actually is.In August 2018, The Economist started an article titled “Was John Maynard Keynes a Liberal?” with the following statement: “In 1944, Friedrich Hayek received a letter from a guest of the Claridge Hotel in Atlantic City, New Jersey. It congratulated the Austria-born economist on his ‘grand’ book The Road to Serfdom, which argued that economic planning posed an insidious threat to freedom. ‘Morally and philosophically, I find myself,’ the letter said, ‘in a deeply moved agreement.’ Hayek’s correspondent was John Maynard Keynes, who was on his way to the Bretton Woods conference in New Hampshire where he would help plan the post-war economic order.”After the end of Bretton Woods, in a paper titled “The Denationalization of Money,” Friedrich Hayek went on to suggest that governments should allow the private issuance of money, such that individuals can choose to use whichever money they want.Choice would lead to competition, he argued, placing a healthy pressure on central planners. It would force them to be judicious about their issuance of money, preventing things like hyperinflation and prolonged malinvestment from ever occurring.Having witnessed the effects of extreme inflation after World War I in Europe — notably Germany, where its desolation ushered in the rise of Hitler — Hayek remained vigilant against inflation throughout his career and was keen to highlight it.But that was a different era.And for all the money the U.S. central banking system has injected in the past two decades, we haven’t seen much price inflation. The excess money instead has turned into increased leveraged speculation. In other words, upon receiving a great sum of money, rather than consuming more we’ve tended to invest more.As the rate of growth in emerging market economies outpaces the growth of the U.S., foreign economy demand for safe dollar-denominated assets has outstripped growth in supply. This asymmetry between supply and demand allows the U.S. to rely on easy credit in normal times and extremely expansionary macroeconomic policies in times of crisis.This seems great; being a reserve currency is an exorbitant privilege. But it is also an exorbitant burden. The problem is that neither countries in surplus nor those in deficit are incentivized to adjust their behaviors.We can’t stop supplying the global economy with dollars even if it hurts us, and the global economy can’t stop demanding them. This conflict of interests is known as Robert Triffin’s dilemma, and it is believed that from this dilemma we’ve seen excessive U.S. indebtedness and risks magnified to disastrous proportions.The historically increasing demand for dollar-denominated safe assets has encouraged the U.S. to issue more and more short-run assets, leading to leveraged risk-taking and magnified boom–bust cycles. Now, alarmingly, the global economy is so interconnected that these business cycles govern all traditional assets, affecting returns on labor and capital alike. In other words, we have no choice but to be repeatedly dislocated by a cycle that even authorities “in control” cannot escape.Back in the 1990s, James Carville, who served as a political adviser during the Bill Clinton presidency, said:“I used to think that if there was reincarnation, I wanted to come back as the president or the pope or as a .400 baseball hitter. But now I would like to come back as the bond market. You can intimidate everybody.”Broadly, the MakerDAO protocol seeks to decentralize a debt-based system of money and promises a stable currency — in the spirit of central banking. Except in this system, policy decisions around fee rates and collateral composition are made not at the discretion of a sovereign authority, but at the discretion of a community.If this sounds great to you, rest assured you’re not alone. But it should be made clear that this approach preys recklessly upon misunderstandings about what makes central banking work and why.Debt has inherent risk because it requires a speculator to accurately anticipate whether a person can pay it back with justifiable interest, or it requires a speculator to accurately forecast the future value of a collateral asset.Rather than increasing or decreasing the supply of its monetary token Dai in response to demand, the MakerDAO system utilizes a separate marketplace with its own dynamics to incentivize users to borrow more or less Dai against the collateral they deposit.Systems of this nature are flawed when disconnected from sovereign authority in general because such free market systems operate by choice and incentive. Participants cannot be forced to take on credit or debt for the good of a network, nor can they be forced to stop taking on credit or debt for the good of a network. They can only be given incentives, such as lower or higher interest rates, to directionally guide actions.A problem arises, eventually, when market incentives become insufficient. We’ve seen this happen repeatedly in repurchase agreement and bond markets, and these are some of the safest instruments out there.However sweet a deal the Venezuelan bond market is offering, you may simply not want to receive any future payments in Venezuelan currency, and you cannot be forced to buy the bonds for the good of the country.Similarly in the case of MakerDAO, however badly the system needs more Dai to function, you may simply not want to borrow against Ether (ETH) to supply it, and you cannot be forced to do so for the good of the network. All open debt marketplaces eventually face liquidity crunches requiring bailouts, even ones run by sovereign authorities.So, unless the administrators of a debt-based money system can print bailout money and ensure the new money has predictable value through legal, political and economic leverage, the system is at the mercy of external lenders. Think of independent systems like this as “god mode” interfaces lacking a god.Recall that Hayek’s recommendation was for authorities to allow the independent issuance of money. Failing this, an independent system would need to be uncensorable to achieve the desired effect. Systems prone to requiring bailouts, such as MakerDAO, are either unreliable or continue to exist only at the discretion of central planners.They work, until it matters.Keeping in mind that we already have an effective centralized system with the necessary authority to bail others out in times of need, it is unclear what purpose there is for things like MakerDAO.They cannot provide customers with meaningfully new choices, let alone keep things like inflation or malinvestment cycles in check. What about providing access to banking services for the unbanked, you ask?Offering access is much like providing choice. An unbanked user simply goes from having zero banking services to the choice of one or more banking services. In turn, this would place pressure on local governments to offer regulated alternatives of greater value or cede the infrastructure to external parties.Similarly, if providing access requires explicit approval, then it is dependent — not independent — and doesn’t require decentralized infrastructure at all.Broadly, the Bitcoin protocol expands the function of commodity monies like gold and silver, making its system of money digitally transactable. Unlike a bank, Bitcoin has no balance sheet and possesses no notion of credit or debt. In other words, the protocol maintains only what users own, not what is owed to them or what they owe to others.It promises only scarcity and censorship resistance. As a result, Bitcoin cannot be bailed out, cannot bail others out and requires virtually no supervision. Like other commodity monies, Bitcoin does not have a “god mode” interface. It simply exists and is difficult to censor or modify.Even without challenging the use of centralized currencies as a medium of exchange, which it is poorly suited to do, Bitcoin functions as a check against inflation and malinvestment. Moreover, its lack of consumptive utility distances it from traditional business cycles.By comparison, commodities like oil can be used to store value but are easily distorted by forces like the demand for travel, which is directly affected by the very business cycles independent money seeks to escape.At present, Bitcoin is a risky asset relative to the dollar. Thus, it would be unwise to retreat into it during times of panic unless other available assets are on even riskier ground. This neither invalidates Bitcoin’s function as a check against inflation nor does it invalidate Bitcoin’s function as a check against malinvestment cycles. To show this, we can simply imagine an economic recovery — the product of a malinvestment bust — that is languishing on. Let’s also imagine that interest rates are low and consumption is low. In this scenario, upon receiving a great sum of money, rather than consuming more we are tending to save more. Holding dollars guarantees losses to inflation, but consumption is down, which limits the rate of return on stocks and commodities. In this case, among many others, Bitcoin provides optionality because its growth rate is easier to disconnect from things like output and consumption. It adds diversity to the ecosystem as a risk asset.“In the longer run and for wide-reaching issues, more creative solutions tend to come from imaginative interdisciplinary collaboration,” as Robert J. Shiller said.Throughout this post, I’ve tried to show that we are truly not starting from scratch. Existing systems, such as central banking, operate effectively in some manners and ineffectively in others for a variety of reasons.When borrowing from existing solutions, we ought to first understand the problems they were meant to solve so that we can avoid the immense cost of inheriting assumptions that simply do not apply.It is straightforward to say that it’s neither plausible nor beneficial to recreate the debt money of sovereign issuers in a decentralized context at this time. However, it does make good sense to expand the function of commodity monies like gold in the spirit of Bitcoin.Given that Bitcoin already exists, how might we continue expanding the function of such monies?We would begin by limiting our toolkit to that of scarcity and censorship resistance. We would then investigate how to increase the diversity of monies, not merely the number of monies. And we would seek to overcome the known limitations of a fixed supply.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.Evan Kuo is the co-founder of Ampleforth, a protocol for synthetic commodity money advised by Niall Ferguson, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University.

specific entities. This is similar to many versions of wrapped Bitcoin 
on ...",,An Argentinian consortium of banks and technology companies under the patronage of the Central Bank of Argentina is promoting a pilot program implementing blockchain. The system would be used to handle direct account debit claims.,"The pilot was announced on April 21 by IOV Labs, the developer of the RSK blockchain. The company is part of the 2019 Financial Innovation Roundtable, which also includes Sabra Group, Banco de la Provincia de Córdoba, BBVA, ICBC, Banco Santander and others.The group has worked for several months since the end of 2019 to create a system that would track bank account transactions through what IOV claims is a decentralized network.Specifically, the blockchain system will handle direct debit transactions for customers, where the payment is initiated by the receiver of the funds and not the sender. Through the blockchain, the group is able to trace the claims between different participants like banks, clearinghouses and financial agents. In this pilot, blockchain solves the key problem of inter-entity messaging, creating a decentralized enterprise network.While the system already exists and is usable, IOV Labs’ goal is to provide a simpler and more efficient alternative to traditional settlement.The solution is being tested by the banks participating in this initiative. When the pilot ends, they will decide if the network should be enlarged with other participants or additional applications.The RSK network is in many ways an Ethereum competitor, but instead of creating an independent network, it piggybacks on Bitcoin (BTC).The network’s native token is a wrapped version of BTC, though it also has its own token called RIF. Bitcoin arrives to the network through a “federated” bridge overseen by specific entities. This is similar to many versions of wrapped Bitcoin on Ethereum.RSK has recently been attempting to catch up to Ethereum in terms of decentralized finance functionality. It hosts two algorithmic stablecoin projects, Money on Chain and the recently launched RIF on Chain.As Cointelegraph reported in February, RSK also launched a bridge to Ethereum, which allows swapping any token between the two networks.The collaboration with the Argentinian financial group can be seen as an expansion into enterprise blockchain territory, currently occupied by projects like the Ethereum Enterprise Alliance, Corda and Hyperledger."

(BTC), USDT, DAI, BAT, ZIL and several other tokens. It is worth ...",,"Incognito is a new privacy and interoperability project that seeks to anonymize the tokens of every other blockchain. As part of that goal, it is launching private versions of leading Ethereum (ETH) decentralized finance platforms.","Announced on April 24, the pKyber initiative is the first part of Incognito’s initiative to make DeFi private. First theorized in October, pKyber began full-scale testing on April 24. The team plans to release this to the Incognito mainnet on May 7.Incognito is a standalone blockchain that focuses on private transactions. Its privacy technology is based on the same technologies used by Monero (XMR), including ring signatures, stealth addresses and confidential transactions.Unlike Monero, Incognito focuses on interoperability with other blockchains and supports private tokens. As Andrey Bugaevski, ecosystem lead at Incognito, told Cointelegraph, the project’s goal is to create a universal sidechain for public blockchains to benefit from privacy features.Bugaevski stressed that while Incognito does not support full smart contracts, it still allows the creation of tokens and a limited set of scripting instructions. These are enough to create trustless bridges with other smart contract platforms.The pKyber platform uses Incognito’s shielding smart contract to interact with the Kyber decentralized exchange on mainnet. Users transact with pEthereum, a private token, to initiate a transaction with pKyber. Incognito’s “Broker” contract on Ethereum reads this data and initiates an Ethereum transaction on Kyber using its shared pool of public ETH.Essentially, Incognito acts as a trustless proxy for private trading instructions, allowing a person to swap ETH for the DAI stablecoin without ever interacting directly with the Ethereum blockchain.Incognito’s roadmap also includes integrations with 0x, Uniswap and the Compound lending platform, all to be finished before July 2020.While DeFi integration is the latest Incognito update, the project achieved many milestones since the launch of its mainnet on Oct. 31, 2019. The project provides today a functional way of shielding Ethereum, Bitcoin (BTC), USDT, DAI, BAT, ZIL and several other tokens.It is worth noting that this system, like any blockchain with opt-in privacy, needs to be used carefully when simply “mixing” funds.Most of the features are accessible through a mobile-centric Incognito wallet, available for both iOS and Android. The wallet includes dedicated features like Incognito’s decentralized exchange, staking services and token shielding.There is a proprietary token called PRV, whose primary purpose is to be used for transaction fees. But the fees can also be paid with the token used for the transaction. This was done to maintain usability, with Bugaevski saying:“We're not trying to build a new privacy coin. Nobody needs a new Monero or a new Zcash”The PRV is used as a block reward for validators, as Incognito uses the Proof of Stake (PoS) model. Unlike many other PoS blockchains, it not run an initial coin offering or airdrop as a token distribution mechanism. While there is an initial “pre-mine” of 5 million PRV reserved for development and the team, 95 million more are expected to be created as block rewards.This poses a problem for distribution, as a pure PoS model would simply have the team own nearly 100% of the supply.To fix this, Incognito used an innovative solution where stakers can borrow 1750 PRV (about $700) as their stake and obtain part of the rewards from that loan. Currently staking can only be done on dedicated node devices, which simulate the acquisition of a mining rig.The system is thus “rigged” to work like a Proof-of-Work system for the initial distribution, with Bugaevski explaining:“The theme here is that every node in the network has the same power. So there is no way that you put more tokens, and you have more [staking] lots.”The project also proposed an innovative solution to the trustless bridge problem in Bitcoin: decentralized custodians. Unlike custodial bridge systems currently used for tokenized Bitcoin, Incognito’s bridge would use a system based on economic incentives and collateral slashing — similar to MakerDAO — to completely decentralize custody.This small project thus appears to have solved some of the more complex problems in cryptocurrency without really compromising on decentralization."

executive explains that she is unhappy about being valued for her looks ...",,"In April 2017, Liliana Pertenava invested around $2,000 in some friends’ Ether mining venture. Having no previous knowledge of cryptocurrency, she then wanted to learn more about blockchain technology and its applications.","Finding little online content explaining how blockchain and cryptocurrency work in simple terms, she decided to create her own documentary. The film follows her on a road-trip across three continents as she talks with over 30 players in the blockchain space.Pertenava also wanted to highlight the stories of female CEOs, investors, and industry professionals, to show that women are important in the field too.Noble aims indeed… so why did ‘Crypto Rush’ end up leaving me so cold?The first thing that hits you are the sloppy production values. The disclaimer shown before the film even starts has a spelling mistake, and it isn’t the only one. At one point we see “$20 000 000” displayed on screen, as the voiceover says “twenty billion dollars.”Non-English speakers do get subtitles, but only if you turn them on for the English speakers too. Pertenava is supposedly a former TV reporter and producer, but struggles to put together quality programming for her debut movie.This could, and should, have been fixed before release, but there are more terminal issues afoot. The camera operator seems perpetually unsure where to focus, or even point the camera. A basic steadicam rig wouldn’t have gone amiss here.The worst problem though is the audio. Interview quality ranges from just about bearable, to compressed to the point of sounding almost robotic. Again, investing in a decent microphone would have done wonders.Furthermore, the single original music track is almost painful to listen to after a while, and you will be hearing it a lot. Apparently this is deliberate, to convey “the discomfort and uncertainty of the heroine.”Sadly, even if you can get past these issues, you are likely to be disappointed. The “uncertainty of the heroine” seems to have extended to exactly what story she was trying to tell.The film documents the period around cryptocurrency’s ‘gold rush’ from 2017 to mid 2018, but there is no sense of the FOMO or investor craziness which occurred at this time. We get a brief explanation of cryptocurrency and how it works, but from there we just traipse from country to country interviewing an interesting, but disparate, group of industry players.In the quest to make this a ‘feature-length’ 90 minutes long, the editor has had to include an awful lot of filler. From the overly-long shots of interview subjects looking awkward, to at one stage, over a minute of footage of people just dancing in a nightclub. No dialogue. No crypto. No explanation.It isn’t obvious that there was any pre-existing plan before setting off around the world to film. We touch upon Bitcoin for retail payments. A South Korean industry executive explains that she is unhappy about being valued for her looks over her brains. We even get a brief insight into what a decentralized internet might be like, although Pertenava herself admits that she doesn’t really understand this… so how does she expect her potential viewers to understand it?The documentary might have worked content-wise, if any one of these angles became the focus of the whole film… and the running time was cut in half.Instead, the viewer is left feeling none the wiser about anything, and the film ends with Pertenava selling her mining rig for the same $2,000 she bought it for, against a backdrop of 2018’s price crash, noting that she feels like she was part of a ‘moment’.Despite its lofty intentions to document crypto’s gold rush, being part travelogue, part crypto 101, and champion of women in the industry, it ultimately fails to achieve any of this. Unfortunately, as much as I want to recommend a film bringing cryptocurrency to the masses, for me this isn’t it.For those who prefer to make up their own minds, the film is available to stream via Vimeo On Demand, where the price for a 48 hour rental is $2.99.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."

pandemic started, yet it might be white noise hiding the real change in ...",,"The COVID-19 pandemic is threatening to plunge the world into the deepest crisis since the Great Depression and could deprive global economies of $5.5 trillion over the next two years. China’s economy shrank for the first time in 44 years, and their gross domestic product fell by 6.8% in the first quarter compared with last year. The pandemic was, naturally, to blame. More worryingly, year-on-year retail sales fell drastically in March. Shops, offices and factories are now starting to reopen, but people remain anxious and movement is restricted. ","However, businesses in Asia are currently recovering from the horrible financial hangover caused by the virus. In this report, Cointelegraph Consulting talks to some of the leading players in the blockchain industry to find out whether the surge is relevant for them or not.Bitcoin (BTC) and other currencies have bounced up and down since the pandemic started, yet it might be white noise hiding the real change in the crypto landscape: surging interest both from the masses and governments. The pandemic has highlighted the fragilities in the traditional financial market, so users may shift their attitudes toward cryptocurrencies. Rather than being alarmed by the crypto market, people can anticipate it. There are three main reasons for wider crypto adoption: inflation of traditional money, decrease of the interest rates of traditional assets and greater control of the levers of the economy by authorities. As governments pump billions of dollars into their economies, inflationary pressure will grow in the next few months. For the population, it means their money will gradually depreciate. “Naturally the question arises, how do I maintain the value of my assets?” said Josh Goodbody, the director of growth and institutional business for the European and Latin America regions at Binance. He added that “people will start seeing crypto as a viable solution to this problem.”Many governments have eased their monetary policies in response to the coronavirus crisis. Central banks have cut interest rates to zero or near-zero rates, and investors who eke out greater returns might turn to the world of crypto. “More assets will shift from low interest-bearing traditional investment vehicles to crypto ones for higher returns potential,” said Alysa Xu, the chief strategy officer of OKEx. The need for serious government intervention in the economy is currently justified by the conditions the crisis dictates. Governments all over the world have taken control of areas that have been liberalized, from prices of specific products to the selection of industries that are allowed to continue working during quarantine. However, the reverse measures might not be that rapid. Cryptocurrencies may be a silver lining to this. As for the authorities, the ongoing coronavirus pandemic has accelerated the development of central bank digital currencies. While cash and ATM use is plunging due to the potential infection risk factor, government stimulus packages imply cash giveaways. Looking for the alternative to cash, authorities have been reevaluating their strategies in favor of CBDCs. “Politicians in the U.S. and Europe think about how a central bank digital currency could work in practice — this is hugely encouraging for the crypto industry,” said Goodboy.Blockchain has been a part of Chinese news coverage since October 2019, when President Xi Jinping backed the technology and set a course for the country to “seize the opportunity” presented. The virus has failed to slow this notion down, with major national initiatives regarding consortium chains and a central bank-issued digital currency continuing the enthusiasm.One major announcement came in the form of a national blockchain network set to launch in April, as it was initially scheduled. The Blockchain-based Service Network was backed by an alliance of Chinese state-owned companies, government agencies, banks and technology companies. The BSN is expected to reduce the costs of doing blockchain-based business in China by 80%. By the end of 2020, the project may cover more than 200 cities and become an example for a global standard.Chinese authorities are also steaming ahead with their plans to launch their own digital currency. The People’s Bank of China has already completed basic function development for a digital yuan. This past week, images of its new digital currency/electronic payment wallet leaked on social media, indicating that it has every intention of pushing the digital currency into institutional and consumer markets.Despite the economic fallout, China has also been continuing the intellectual race. While major multinational companies including Microsoft, Walmart, Mastercard, Sony and Intel had applied for a total of 212 blockchain patents as of the end of March, their number of patents was inferior to the number from Chinese companies in 2019, and it is expected that this trend will continue. The overall number of blockchain patent applications might not exceed last year’s result of 5,800 filings, yet getting close to that figure in such a turbulent year would testify to the healthy development of the technology.Alibaba subsidiary Ant Financial also grabbed the spotlight by announcing its new consortium chain called OpenChain. It is targeting the highly competitive consortium chain market, which includes nearly all the major tech companies in the world. Ant Financial’s platform Alipay is one of the largest mobile payment processors in the world, with a well-established offering of financial services.Overall, the pandemic hasn’t hindered the development of the Chinese blockchain industry severely, so a quick recovery will happen easier than for other industries. However, a deeper dive into the sectors can reveal the effects and responses of businesses there. The COVID-19 crisis gave platforms a strong wake up call regarding risk and budget management. For those that fail to adequately manage the situation, the threat of insolvency is a strong possibility. In early April, the public blockchain platform Factom failed to receive additional funding and was moving toward a possible liquidation of assets. For other platforms with better-managed cash flows, the COVID-19 crisis has been less detrimental. Here’s a closer look at how four platforms with offices in China have managed the crisis:With a focus on enterprise use cases, VeChain has acknowledged the challenge that COVID-19 is posing to many of its clients. The virus had an unavoidable impact on client development, allowing teams to turn resources toward other areas of growth. VeChain took the opportunity to focus on its core software offering, such as a new version of its ToolChain blockchain-as-a-service platform, which helps clients verify products and grant insight into a product’s data, manufacturing and supply chain processes. VeChain’s chief operating officer, Kevin Feng, told Cointelegraph that: “The COVID-19 outbreak has raised public awareness on product authentication and transparency of the supply chain management especially on those products that are related to consumer daily life. We have observed a significant shift in consumer behavior, and people now have a greater appetite for buying products online and mobile applications.” Feng also recognized that the COVID-19 crisis was exposing pain points in industries all over the world, especially in areas like management, digitalization and implementation. Even with the increasing awareness of blockchain adoption, Feng believes that the financial challenges of the pandemic will make pouring more investment into new technologies a tough decision for businesses to make. This operational freeze gives VeChain more time to secure its position in the market and prepare for when businesses decide to move on innovation. Feng concluded: “Under the unprecedented demand for cloud-based services and IT services, the blockchain technology that serves as the underlying infrastructure powering digital transition has emerged as an advanced option for enterprise decision-makers.”Ontology is another major platform tackling enterprise blockchain use cases. During the initial outbreak in China, the company swiftly adopted a work-from-home strategy and relied on its global network of offices and partners to continue operations with minimal disruption. Its decentralized project structure meant staff were already accustomed to working remotely, which helped maintain stability. Like most of China, Ontology’s employees are currently required to disinfect offices, wear face masks and record temperatures daily.From an operations perspective, Ontology is committed to completing its 2020 technical roadmap. Named “Aristotle,” it includes many important milestones such as cross-chain functionality with Ether (ETH) and Bitcoin, distributed identity solutions and making sure its blockchain virtual machine is compatible with the latest smart contract frameworks, such as Wasmjit.Ontology’s co-founder Andy Ji believes that the lockdown in China may have created physical distance compared to office work, but on the other hand it surprisingly has brought more motivation, efficiency and energy to its daily operations and has allowed the company to be more focused on achieving its goals. Ontology took up the fight against COVID-19 by sending masks to worldwide blockchain charities and joining the #cryptoCOVID19 campaign promoting measures to bring the crisis to an end. In addition, the company has continued to offer online courses to developers and students worldwide and even partnered with freelance work platform Microworkers to speed up workers’ payments.PlatON is a public blockchain platform with a focus on data exchange and privacy. During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, around 5% of its team was locked down without access to proper working facilities. The team developed an online control system to make sure it was on track while working remotely. It also recognized that a lot of community and freelance developers were available, so it aggressively adjusted its development grants. The company’s chief technology officer, James Qu, believes that the decentralized culture of blockchain helped make the transition smooth. The company focused on stability and technical upgrades early on, helping to get its operations up to speed. It has also been eyeing the lucrative consortium market now that government and enterprise demand in China is continuing to rise. Its technology has already been used in a number of successful consortium chain projects in the country.QuarkChain provides an underlying technical solution for blockchains based on sharding technology. As a technology-driven company, it has managed to maintain operations while its 40 employees spread around the world have continued to work on an infrastructure that connects both consortium and public chain technology. QuarkChain’s chief marketing officer, Anthurine Xiang, reported that despite some client-side delays, it has had more time to invest in research and development.Xiang said that following the outbreak, countries like China began to rethink how to build up more advanced infrastructure to better respond to large scale events like a public health crisis, adding: “We are providing the government with multiple project solutions for the public health system, such as blockchain solutions, resource management, and trading platforms.” The pandemic threatens the sustainability of many physical business models, but for online models it has been an opportunity to connect with their user base and expand. Given the worldwide lockdowns, customer demand has been pushed from offline to online. OKEx’s chief strategy officer, Alyssa Xu, believes this will lead to wider acceptance of digitalization and ultimately benefit the popularization of the blockchain-driven economy. She stated in a conversation with Cointelegraph:“Since the virus outbreak in January, the exchange has a steady growth in constant, while it estimated a 19% boost in terms of trading volume during early March.”Xu believes that the pandemic is a test of how urgently a company can respond and adapt to changes in the market conditions of its customers. She was very pleased with how OKEx’s platform responded to the “Black Thursday” market crash on March 12. Despite a huge decline in the prices of crypto, the trading system maintained zero clawback and withstood the volatility and chaos. Xu now wants to take advantage of increased user volume to widen the company’s range of services, including crypto derivatives products and public chain-based decentralized finance applications.Binance is a global company with a strong community in Asia. Despite the chaos in worldwide markets, Binance reported a robust first quarter performance, attributing it to the record high volume across its platform and the crypto market in general. With the strong user activity, Binance has responded by increasing its team across all regions by 100 employees.Goodbody, Binance’s director of growth and institutional business, felt that the quantitative easing and stimulus packages from central banks could lead to economic instability. Politicians and world governments could turn to CBDCs as a method of distributing stimulus packages, which he believes is an encouraging sign for the industry.With everything running smoothly, Binance was able to turn to philanthropy. Binance Charity launched the Binance for Wuhan initiative and donated $1.5 million worth of medical supplies to hospitals, medical centers, etc. In March, Binance Charity launched the Crypto Against COVID initiative, aiming to raise $5 million for countries worst affected by the virus.As the global lockdown continues to last, company revenues can be undermined or cut off entirely. This is where venture capital firms and incubators become more important than ever, as access to cash and investments can be the difference between insolvency and survival. Shanghai-based venture capital firm Hashkey Capital observed that many enterprises are struggling to raise capital, forcing them to lower fundraising targets. Its investment director Yu Zongmin noted that: “It is a great opportunity for us to find better value in the current market. For the operational strategy, we may raise the bar higher for recent investments and focus more on the commercial maturity and cash flow of the projects.” He went on to add that: “A positive outcome from the crisis is the rising participation and connectivity of people in the digital world. People are minimizing in-person contact through mediums such as e-commerce, e-school, e-clinic and e-cash. This has played a pivotal role in containing the virus spread. The blockchain sector may greatly benefit from the booming development of the global e-cash ecosystem. We are very optimistic about this industry as always, and will continue to actively search for high quality and value driven projects to invest in.”China-based technology incubator New Chainbase was working to accommodate many of its projects. Its operations levels have returned to normal, but it is offering a relief plan for start-ups renting office space from it. New Chainbase has a long-term financial interest in the blockchain space and has remained optimistic that industries will see the trust that blockchain provides as an essential technology moving forward.Fenbushi Capital, a global industry player with offices in Shanghai, New York and Silicon Valley, is no stranger to working in a decentralized manner. Its operations have remained quite stable, but it has observed that companies in its portfolio have been performing certain cost controls, including staff reduction and lowering their operating costs. Fenbushi Capital partner Rin Huang attributes this to two factors: First, the crisis has forced a reduction in business volume and the companies do not need so many people. Second, the overall economic situation is uncertain due to the crisis and companies need to maintain sufficient cash flow.Huang noted that for her daily role, the crisis has had little impact. With traffic jams already back in the streets of Shanghai, her routine has returned, with the exception that many processes are now conducted online. She sees blockchain having more opportunities in enterprise situations such as traceability of medical supplies: “In order to prevent possible counterfeit medical device products, the government began to vigorously promote the supply chain of medical device products to be traceable on the blockchain.” Additionally, the technology can help in digitizing the industries:“The digitization of the consumer industry in China has been well developed, and the emergence of the crisis has further promoted the electronic communication system within the management process of the enterprises. The main role of the blockchain at this stage is to hash the important information for internal communication on the chain.“The Bitcoin mining hash rate has been climbing consistently, but the upcoming halving event and macroeconomic instability has led to uncertainty in the mining community. Nathaniel Yu, the international marketing manager of mining leader Bitmain, understands the importance of normalizing operations right now. He stated that while Bitmain is following professional advice for dealing with the pandemic, it is also exploring alternate methods of working in order to meet demand for its Antminer products. In a conversation with Cointelegraph, Yu stated:“During these uncertain times, the best way ahead for the mining industry is to continue to adapt their operations to ensure the safety of all employees comes first. Miners will also need to assess their operations to ensure they are operating as efficiently and effectively as possible during this time.”Like other online business models, many media sites are reporting a jump in viewers as people generally have more free time on their hands. Two major Chinese blockchain media sites, 8btc and Odaily, confirmed in interviews that they are both optimistic about the industry moving forward. Gavin Qu, a partner of 8btc and the CEO of ChainNode, believes that the current situation can be advantageous for online companies with a healthy cash flow. Qu explained how ChainNode moved quickly to develop an online product release conference service to help business partners bring their offline conferences and product announcements online through live video on the platform. He believes that the importance of online events will become greater even after the pandemic, as China’s mobile internet infrastructure continues to move toward 5G technology. Mandy Wang, the CEO and co-founder of Odaily, talked about how the company has shifted much of its operations to an online model since the pandemic began. One of her editors was initially locked down in Hubei province, unable to return to the company’s Beijing offices. She spoke about the challenges of conducting all interviews over the phone and moving all offline events online. On April 10, Odaily held an all-day conference with over 30 guests in an online streaming format. With chaos gripping the global markets, she reported an increase in views by around 20%. She accredited part of that success to increasing the company’s operating efficiency and risk control management policies, which she believes will become a greater subject of focus for enterprises in China moving forward.For an industry built on a decentralized emerging technology, it’s no surprise that the blockchain world has embraced the remote working and video conferencing reality. Technology and agile management has managed to normalize many business processes, but disruption to other industries has made it difficult to raise funds, develop new clients and oversee physical implementation of enterprise services. Outstanding issues in the aforementioned areas should be addressed as soon as possible to prevent the loss of clients and ensure budgets can withstand an extended period of reduced revenue and third-party investment. With the bulk of major offline events in quarters one through three wiped out or moved to an online format, it’s up to marketing teams to find new ways to promote their businesses. After the initial shock and subsequent organizational restructuring, there’s been heavy interindustry collaboration in Asia, with platforms, media and exchanges organizing online events to connect with new users and their existing communities. R&D and technical development teams have remained mostly unaffected by the virus, needing only minor adjustments to organizational processes.Rather than panicking at the thought of a potential economic recession, most industry players are optimistic about the long-term outlook, especially considering the reactionary fiscal stimulus policies that are being put in place by nearly every major government. The companies see digital currencies as both a potential solution to monetary distribution as well as a sanctuary from inflationary currency policies. Finally, with China’s central bank and government agencies continuing to restate their commitment to blockchain technology and a national digital currency, there’s very little doubt that the companies that adapt and survive will find themselves in a very active and healthy industry in the future."

He has decided instead to venture into the crypto business. Starting May 1, Carrillo will become the CEO of Fight to Fame, though his role only extends to Mexico and the Latin American region.","According to an article published on April 29 by the Mexican newspaper, El Universal, Carrillo will lead the Singapore-based crypto firm founded by Morgan Shi. This company is known for issuing the FF Token.Fernando, who is known for serial dramas such as “Siempre te amaré” and “Maria Isabel,” and films like “Pit Fighter” and “Gone Hollywood, “plans to get married and start a family, running his career in the world of cryptocurrencies.”Carrillo spoke about the FF Token, praising its success in Asia. He also believes that the blockchain is the future. As such, he will be working to make the token a direct competitor from Bitcoin (BTC).With regard to FF Tokens in the Mexican market, the actor commented:“It is a world that I am getting to know, wonderful, just as you can win, you can lose. We are going to launch 40 million cryptocurrencies to the Mexican market, taking into account that we sold 37.5 million in Peru (…) Now we want to expand in Latin America.”The founder of Fight to Fame has been the subject of controversy in recent years. Some allegations claim that the company is a fraudulent scheme.According to a Wall Street Journal report in 2019, Morgan Shi’s real name is “Shi Jianxiang,” who is a fugitive from Chinese authorities. He is accused of committing fraud and causing “trillions” of dollars to vanish.Interpol issued a global wanted-persons notice against Shi in 2017 at the request of the Chinese government, who accused him of “crime of illegal fundraising by fraudulent means.” Despite the accusation, a spokeswoman for the FBI claimed not to have a warrant for Shi.On the controversial reports on the legal status of Shi’s activities, Carrillo came to his defense:“Morgan (Shi) lives in Los Angeles. Communist China persecuted many wealthy people to expropriate their wealth, but he was able to get out of there. If you search for his name on the internet, there will be some accusations that he is searched by Interpol, but it is a montage. Since working with him, he has been a righteous person, who has brought me knowledge, riches. I believe in what he’s doing.”Cointelegraph reported in 2019 that former world boxing champion, Mike Tyson, refuted his involvement with Fight to Fame. The company was accused by the crypto research and analysis firm, Cointelligence, who called it a “total fraud.”"

2019. Beam is a privacy-oriented cryptocurrency, like Monero (XMR) ...",,"Privacy-focused altcoin, Beam (BEAM), will soon execute its second hard fork. This fork will upgrade its Proof-of-Work (PoW) algorithm and activate new network features.","According to an April 22 blog post, Beam’s second fork will occur at block 777,777, shifting the network’s PoW algorithm from BeamHash II to BeamHash III.The new PoW algorithm is expected to be a major improvement to the Beam mining network, and will enable fuller GPU card capabilities. Additionally, the firm said that the hard fork is designed to unlock some new features like confidential assets, one-sided payments, and the support of privacy protocol, Lelantus Mimblewimble.Beam’s second hard fork is expected to take place on June 28, 2020. The testnet fork is anticipated to happen a few weeks earlier, Beam advisor, Guy Corem, noted in the Beam Telegram channel. Corem elaborated that the testnet fork date depends on block times.According to the announcement, the hard fork will not require any other actions beyond a software upgrade from Beam users. As such, Beam is planning to release the node and desktop wallet binaries by the end of May, providing users with about 30 days to upgrade to the latest version. Compatible releases of node, wallet, and miner will be versioned Eager Electron 5.0, Beam noted.Specifically, Beam wallets earlier than version 5.0 will stop working after the hard fork is completed. However, users will still be able to upgrade the wallets to the new version to access their funds, Corem said.As officially announced, Beam successfully completed its first hard fork on August 19, 2019. This fork changed the mining algorithm from Beam Hash I to Beam Hash II at block 321,321. After the hard fork occurred, the Beam team reported a significant drop in mining difficulty. This was caused by some miners not performing a timely upgrade.The Beam mainnet was launched on Bitcoin’s (BTC) tenth birthday, Jan. 3, 2019. Beam is a privacy-oriented cryptocurrency, like Monero (XMR) or Zcash (ZEC), and is based on a privacy protocol known as Mimblewimble. In late 2019, Dragonfly Research analyst, Ivan Bogatyy, argued that the Mimblewimble protocol should not be considered a “viable alternative to Zcash or Monero when it comes to privacy” due to an unfixable privacy breach. Subsequently, Beam challenged Bogatyy’s “Breaking Mimblewimble’s Privacy Model,” arguing that his research approach does not work with Beam.In March, Litecoin (LTC) and Grin (GRIN) developer, David Burkett, predicted that Litecoin will launch its Mimblewimble testnet before the end of summer."

In response, many charitable organizations and philanthropists from various industries have come forward to offer their support. ","In the cryptocurrency industry, companies such as BitMEX, Binance and the Stellar Foundation have been making headlines week after week for being at the forefront in an attempt to make sizable donations to COVID-19 relief funds. Here is a look at some of the biggest and most remarkable donations from crypto-related companies.As early as Jan. 25, Changpeng Zhao, the CEO of a top-ranking crypto exchange Binance, announced in a tweet that his company has pledged to donate $1.5 million (10M RMB) to help the victims of the coronavirus in Wuhan, China. The funds are to be donated to the Chinese authorities to purchase medical supplies in the wake of the disastrous pandemic. Through Binance Charity, a nonprofit blockchain-powered donation arm of the company, an initiative titled “Binance for Wuhan” that kicked off by supplying 20,000 testing kits, 366,000 pairs of gloves, 5,280 bottles of hand sanitizer and 388 oxygen concentrators among other kinds of supplies.Binance Charity went further, announcing a new fundraising project that aimed to tackle the coronavirus globally. The company aims to raise $5 million in cryptocurrencies that would go toward buying medical supplies for countries most affected by COVID-19. Helen Hai, the head of Binance Charity, said that: “The most important element of human life is to show compassion and help others as we can, without the limitation or restriction of borders.”At the beginning of April, the Stellar Development Foundation announced the launch of the XLM-donation-matching program powered by Stellar-based Lumentrhopy, a fundraiser that helps charitable organizations accept Stellar Lumens.One of the nonprofits, with which the SDF plans to match donations, is with the Tor Project. Reports indicated that SDF is set to match donations to a total of $79,300, which adds up to about 1.9 million XLM tokens. The Stellar Development Fund will also match donations to Unicef France; Heifer International, an organization fighting hunger through offering support for small scale farmers; and Watsi, a nonprofit that streamlines health care financing through building technology. In a conversation with Cointelegraph, Lauren Thorbjornsen, the director of communications and public relations at SDF, said: “The Stellar Development Foundation is fortunate to have XLM reserves and an active community. Combining the power of those two things, we’ve been able to work together to help organizations (UNICEF, The Tor Project, Heifer International, Watsi, Freedom of the Press and Women Who Code) that are creating vital change in the world.”She also mentioned that SDF has “worked with Stellar network partner, Lumenthropy, to give back to this group of charities,” which they believe are relevant to some of the pressing challenges given the unfolding crisis.On March 23, The Giving Block, a company that helps nonprofit charitable organizations accept crypto donations, announced the start of the #cryptoCOVID19 alliance. The initiative wants to unite the crypto community in the fight against the coronavirus. Gitcoin, one of the partners in the campaign, kicked off the donation by matching $100,000 in Ether (ETH) on the Dai platform. The Giving Block has also partnered with the likes of Brave, Gemini and Axiom Finance to raise $500,000 in crypto donations.In response to a question about how the company ensures transparency throughout the process, Alex Wilson, the co-founder of The Giving Block, responded by saying: “We vet all of the nonprofits we work with to make sure they are legitimate and putting the funds to good use. All the crypto donations (BTC, ETH, LTC, BCH, ZEC, GUSD) all go directly to the nonprofit’s wallets and can be converted to USD so they can use the funds on the front lines immediately.”He also added that “all registered nonprofits must report their cryptocurrency donations and include it in their annual filings.”In a commitment to the global response by organizations and individuals concerning the COVID-19 pandemic, Ripple Labs announced its donation of $200,000 on March 25. The company has donated $100,000 to the Tipping Point Community, a nonprofit organization based in San Francisco, which later raised the total donation to $1.1 million for victims of the coronavirus in the U.S.Besides, Ripple Lab’s donations will also go to the Silicon Valley Community Foundation, which is a dedicated regional fund in response to the coronavirus outbreak in Silicon Valley. While dwelling on the impact and transparency of donations during this period, Cointelegraph spoke to a Ripple spokesperson who said that: “Ripple is working with local Bay Area partners who are on the frontlines to help our communities who have been heavily impacted by COVID-19.” The spokesperson continued:“Ripple and its co-founder, Chris Larsen, have together donated $5 million to local food banks and meal service providers to combat food scarcity, and $1.1 million to the COVID-19 emergency funds of Tipping Point, an organization leading the local crisis response.” BitMEX, the derivatives exchange backed by Arthur Hayes, recently announced that it is donating a total of $2.5 million in support of the fight against the coronavirus. In an announcement, BitMEX stated that the funds will be directed to four organizations at the forefront of the fight against the pandemic. These organizations include a biosecurity program called the Nuclear Threat Initiative, the Gates Philanthropy Partners, Our World in Data and OpenMinded.In a statement, Hayes said that the company is “committed to thoughtful grant-making and ensuring that” its “actions during the COVID-19 crisis can make the biggest impact now and in the future.”Golem, a computing network, is another contributor from the crypto sector to join the fight against COVID-19 through the Folding@Homes project. Golem and blockchain platform Tezos have set aside hundreds of Tezos coins (XTZ) that will be given to the biggest F@H donor by the end of April.Cointelegraph reported earlier that there were around 20 teams from Tezos that had donated different resources to the F@H initiative by March 12. Another major contributor to the initiative is Ether miner CoreWeave, which has donated computational power of about 6,000 GPUs. Nvidia has also contributed toward the project by urging gamers to donate unutilized GPU computing resources.Notably, blockchain company Bitfury announced on March 31 that the Amsterdam-based firm had dedicated some of its GPU computer nodes to the “Folding@Home” research project to help organizations look into the coronavirus. In a slightly different use of computing power, blockchain company Real Items announced that it would be working with microfiber manufacturer Tricol Group’s factories in Seattle and China to track the authenticity of their production of KN95 masks using blockchain technology. The United States Food and Drug Administration had recently approved the use of KN95 masks for health care workers, which are manufactured in accordance with Chinese rather than American standards, as N95 masks are becoming increasingly hard to find.On April 7, Jack Dorsey, the CEO of Twitter and the founder of Square payment solution, announced that he had moved $1 billion to his newly started company called Start Small LLC, which currently aims to fight COVID-19. Notably, the fund is around 28% of his wealth. Dorsey promised that the funds will be operated transparently with a #startsmall tracker.Dorsey is also a well-known supporter of Bitcoin (BTC). Addressing the U.S. government, he proposed that they unite together to use existing technology such as Square’s Cash App to seamlessly help people during the pandemic — even the unbanked.As more blockchain and crypto-related companies join the fight, it is becoming evident that blockchain technology can be used beyond solving the challenges of the financial world. According to some, such moments like these will push the dialogue forward on the subject of using cryptocurrencies daily.Related: Coronavirus Crisis Accelerates CBDC Race, Cash No Longer UntouchableFor example, while Thorbjornsen believes that the dominance of paper cash is still strong, she agreed that the current pandemic will further increase talks about the use of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. According to Wilson, the pandemic has shown that the crypto community can collaborate despite various disagreements:“COVID-19 has shown that the cryptocurrency community is willing to put differences aside and come together to support those in need during difficult times.”"

fluctuate, indicating to some that it would not be able to handle the ...",,"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has brought into focus the need for international cooperation and support. Coupled with a crumbling economy, it’s shown us that now is the time for a modern, accessible reserve currency. However, markets don’t exist in a vacuum of supply and demand — there are reasons why the United States dollar is the world’s reserve currency. To understand the structural value of an economy and different markets, you first must understand how different types of production operate in times of crisis.","In a world crisis like COVID-19, countries would rather hold on to their U.S. dollars, as their local currencies have become rapidly devalued. Today, they have turned to digital currencies. The U.S. dollar is currently the world’s reserve currency partly because of its ability to remain stable amid a global crash. However, this is an oversimplification and the wrong way to understand the true value and necessity of a reserve currency. Just as each great civilization has yielded to the next one, every reserve currency in post-Renaissance history has had a lifespan of about 100 years, leading many to believe the U.S. dollar is in decline and will give way to a new reserve currency. If there is to be a new reserve currency — and not to say there can only be one — it will need to be better than the world’s current reserve currency: the U.S. dollar.What factors have made the U.S. dollar optimized for stability? Geopolitics, geographical isolation and its natural resources have all contributed. A large internal market population and a stable trading environment have also helped. This has served the U.S. well, but an innovative new reserve currency should seek to increase accessibility to bolster stability.This is where the value of cryptocurrencies is really on display for emerging markets because a cryptocurrency can be both fully accessible and received freely through network participation. This is true financial inclusion where it is not simply an exchange of fiat currencies to crypto ones but a new type of production that includes the financially excluded.In the 12 years since Bitcoin’s inception, cryptocurrency has become the pinnacle of international economic cooperation in the modern era. Its value transcends political affiliation and sovereignty and is instead derived from algorithmic and calculable value. With its potential to completely reconstruct the role of government in the financial arena and its mission to revolutionize and expand access to markets, cryptocurrency is poised as a very real and viable candidate for the next global reserve currency.Cryptocurrency is not without its skeptics, though — traditional finance experts have some doubts about crypto as the world’s next reserve currency or the necessity for it at all. In the past, reserve currencies arose from powerful sovereign governments whose trade and economic value was stable. The price of Bitcoin (BTC) and other crypto reserve currencies notoriously fluctuate, indicating to some that it would not be able to handle the weight of global trade.There’s also the concern that crypto may not have the flexibility to settle global contracts. Although crypto is already used internationally, in order to be the next reserve currency, it would need to build the infrastructure to support mass adoption and mainstream use.The third reservation experts have is that cryptocurrencies are owned by private companies, whereas, traditionally, reserve currencies have been affiliated with governments. The concern is that a corporate-owned reserve currency would be free to act on private interests. Facebook’s Libra faced these very criticisms last year. Even though it poses a promising model for cryptocurrency as the next global reserve currency, governments and international organizations have been outspoken about its conflict with antitrust laws. Of these three concerns, the infrastructural hurdle holds the most weight. But the worries over crypto’s volatility and corporate interests are mostly unwarranted.If making a new, accepted stable currency is hard, then making a new reserve currency would be exponentially harder. Even if we did have more reserve currencies, there’s still a huge problem.In our centralized economy, no matter how good a reserve currency is, no matter how good any economy is, it will always be exclusive to those who have existing capital and are in the financial system.The gap between the rich and the poor increases the benefits of reserve currencies and only benefits the established anyway. If we make a new reserve currency, it has to also solve financial inequality as well.Essentially, direct distribution is an innate quality of cryptocurrencies. But in order for cryptocurrencies to be distributed for free and with value, the crypto token must truly harness the decentralized network value it is created with.In fact, a new reserve currency will come along at any time with any fiat-denominated currency that decides to get its act together and be a source of stability. This could be a powerhouse country like China or a country that’s been stable for decades, like Japan. If countries like South Korea are able to create a new source of production other than export, or if Australia, Canada or New Zealand become high-tech centers, any one of these countries could present another relatively strong reserve currency.When we talk about the effects of these reserve currencies in crises, again, we look at COVID-19 and see which socioeconomic class is really getting hit hardest by it. When we do, it’s clear that even if countries get stability from reserve currencies, their most vulnerable classes still do not. If we’re able to solve this kind of reserve currency issue and actually benefit those who are both established and not established, then we provide a truly new layer of resilience to the economy. As a result, we can bolster the economy as a whole for crypto, fiat or otherwise.As we navigate through this tumultuous pandemic and the economic crisis it has incited, it is more important now than it has ever been in most people’s lifetimes to cooperate on a global scale. In order to reach this level of cooperation, we must rethink institutions that we have previously taken as givens. As the U.S. dollar continues to lose its value, its position as the world reserve currency becomes more and more precarious. It is time for a crypto reserve currency to take up the mantle and seize its role as the future of finance.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.Sinjin David Jung is the founder of The International Blockchain Monetary Reserve, a microfinance ecosystem platform behind the Asia Reserve Currency Coin — the world’s first “micro asset” that enables the financial inclusion of the urban working poor in Southeast Asia.

companies, they hold lots of the Bitcoin. So that's the relationship 
between the ...",,"Speaking at the Virtual Blockchain Week (VBW), Tron founder Justin Sun presented his side of the recent events involving Tron’s ""partnership"" with Steemit Inc, and the subsequent hard fork that resulted in Hive (HIVE) forking away from Steem (STEEM).","During February, it was reported that Justin Sun had acquired Steemit Inc alongside the platform’s founder’s reward of 20% of the total STEEM token supply. In response to the purported acquisition, the Steem community moved to initiate a fork to freeze the reward.At VWB, Sun stated that he does not think the term “‘acquisition’ is the right word to describe the partnership between the Tron Foundation and Steemit Inc.”“At the beginning, we didn't use the word acquisition, we more talk about partnership,” said Justin, seeking to clarify the nature of the relationship:“Steemit Inc take a certain percentage of the tokens inside of the Steemit ecosystem, and also Steemit.com is one of the most important apps in the ecosystem [...] Bitcoin, like Steem, is definitely decentralized, but [some] of the companies, they hold lots of the Bitcoin. So that’s the relationship between the company and the Steem blockchain.”While emphasizing his preferred nomenclature of ""partnership,"" Sun acknowledged that, as one of the largest decentralized apps operating on Steem, “Steemit Inc definitely has some influence on the Steem blockchain.”In March, Sun controversially collaborated with major exchanges Binance and Huobi to oust Steem’s former node operators — prompting reports of a hostile takeover. The exchanges quickly withdrew their votes — including customer funds that had mobilized for governance voting — claiming that they were unaware they were supporting the removal of Steem’s node operators.The incident proved to be the final straw in the dispute, with the Hive hard fork transpiring over the following weeks. The Hive hard fork froze the founder’s reward, prompting retaliation from Steem — freezing STEEM tokens associated with the actors who spearheaded the hard fork.“First of all, when Steemit Inc [got] into the Steem ecosystem, we find out our assets are frozen by some malicious actors,” Sun stated during VBW.“When Hive do the hard fork, they actually frozen and take all the funds of those people who disagree with them not only us, the community in Korea, and China — they just take their funds in the Hive blockchain,” he asserted. “That’s why we collaborated with the exchanges — to get those funds recovered [...], and that's why we believe we are doing the right thing.”“We just recovered the funds [...] we didn't do anything other than that. We collaborated with some third parties to refund all the funds for the users, [...] and after that, we leave all the decisions to be made by the Steem community.”"

challenges of a collapsing economy compared to more established ...",,"The current pandemic is far from over and the economic, political, and social ramifications of this crisis remain unclear. Indeed, the nature of the workplace people return to might well be radically different to what previously existed. During an online panel session, hosted by Cointelegraph’s Stephen Chase, fintech pioneers debated how the Coronavirus could act as a catalyst for change in people’s attitudes towards working, technology, and online payments. ","Given the 24/7 nature of cryptocurrencies, all the panelists had remote working policies in place prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, so the immediate disruption was minimal. When asked which sectors were most likely to benefit from the lockdown, online services for retail and entertainment were cited as obvious winners and likely to grow even after the quarantine ends. The panelists also agreed that the death of physical cash was likely to be accelerated by the pandemic. Contactless payments prevent the transmission of Coronavirus through potentially contaminated bank notes, forcing older generations into using alternative payment methods.The surprising resilience of Bitcoin as an asset class when faced with the challenges of a collapsing economy compared to more established peers, including the S&P and oil, was also debated. Filipe Castro, co-founder of Blockchain payments platform, Utrust, emphasized that Bitcoin’s potential use case is evolving and being tested all the time. He and the other panelists agreed that, faced with increased Central Bank money printing, Bitcoin’s finite supply of coins will likely lead to a price rise in the long term.When asked about the future and how digital currency technology can provide hope, Ian Kane, Co-Founder and COO of Ternio, said there was never a better time to take this technology and use it to solve real problems. Those companies that provide the best user experience will ultimately succeed in the long run. Ian did note, however, that he would like to see the U.S. follow Switzerland’s approach to taxation. He said:“For something like a currency, where it's meant for small micropayments/tipping, you shouldn’t be paying 40% short term capital gains, it makes no sense. When the internet came out, if every time you clicked on a new web page, you had to pay a tax or some kind of toll to gain information, it wouldn’t make any sense. It kind of hinders the progress being made [in crypto]”Robert Beadles, Co-Founder for Monarch also provided an upbeat assessment of digital currencies saying they were the future and could be applied to a wide variety of use cases, particularly in the charitable sector where questions related to transparency and accountability are a concern. Ultimately for crypto to succeed, it needs to provide tangible solutions to real problems. By educating more people about its potential, we can build the platforms of the future and ensure its long term place within the economy. The times we’re living in may seem dark, but the future for those who embrace tech has never been brighter.Missed the panel? Check it out on Youtube here, or watch it below."

Jelurida intends to distribute 10,000 tokens (about $212) daily among node hosters every day for the next six months.According to the data provided, the Ardor blockchain’s node count increased by almost 200% from 241 to 708, while Nxt’s blockchain increased by 315% from 159 to 659. The number of archival nodes increased even more sharply: Nxt archival nodes count increased by 2311% from 17 to 410 and Ardor’s by 1110% from 38 to 461.Jelurida co-founder and director Lior Yaffe said the results had exceeded the firm’s expectations and would have a positive impact on the network’s health and resilience:“For a public blockchain protocol having a strong network of nodes using many different hardware brands, operating systems, cloud providers and geographies is especially important to make the network more resilient to attack, manipulation or technical failure.”Yaffe also pointed out the firm yesterday updated Nxt to allow full-nodes to run on mobile phones. He said he was pleased with the design of the program because — while usual staking programs mostly reward large token holders — this initiative incentivizes people without large crypto holdings.Nodes are a sometimes overlooked, but crucial part, of blockchain infrastructure that are often run at the hoster’s expense. While nodes allow direct access to the blockchain and better privacy and security when used for one’s own transactions, hosting them isn’t normally compensated.Because of this, it is important for cryptocurrency firms to make running a node as cheap as possible. When it comes to Bitcoin, as Cointelegraph reported in June 2019, all one needs to host a node is a small Raspberry Pi which costs about $35 and fits into one’s hand. In late October last year, HTC also launched a phone which is capable of running a Bitcoin full node."

Since the reality of the pandemic took hold, it has revealed itself to be a black swan the likes of which have never before been seen.","Cryptocurrencies suffer from volatility in the best of times, and markets have spent most of the last two years in the red. But companies, markets and entire economies all over the world are tanking. So, is cryptocurrency’s notorious Achilles' heel affecting its banking and payments sector?There’s not a business in the entire world unaffected by the coronavirus. Never have companies been faced with such a sudden onslaught of unforeseen pressures, with supply chains interrupted and customers and employees alike locked down worldwide.Crucially, many crypto firms are committed to decentralization, meaning that working from home has been a relatively easy shift. But some of the industry’s biggest names have been snarled up in the fallout from the coronavirus. SoftBank Group Corp., the parent company of Fortress Investment Group, is expected to rack up a $12.5 billion loss for the financial year that ended in March.Founded by Masayoshi Son, a Korean-Japanese billionaire tech entrepreneur, investor and philanthropist, SoftBank Group Corp. is one of the most prominent crypto holding companies operating in Asia. But it appears that the Vision Fund, an investment fund in which SoftBank has a $33 billion stake, is proving to be a major drain on the company’s profits. The group announced that it was set to lose $17 billion after its fateful investment.But this isn’t the first time that the bank’s CEO has been burned by crypto. Son allegedly lost $130 million after a poorly judged Bitcoin (BTC) investment. He reportedly bought in when crypto’s most famous token was soaring high back in 2017.But SoftBank isn’t alone in struggling with its crypto-related business. With yet another net loss in the fourth quarter of 2019, it seems that Galaxy Digital’s stars are far from aligned. Galaxy Digital is a major cryptocurrency investment bank founded by ex-Goldman Sachs partner Mike Novogratz with the ambitious vision of institutionalizing the crypto industry.The industry has seen a huge influx of institutional interest, varying from utility, to coins, to central bank digital currencies, but Galaxy Digital has struggled to balance its books, with nearly constant quarter-on-quarter losses.As per an April 8 announcement, the company reported a net loss of $32.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, citing “realized loss on digital assets” and operating expenses as the reason for the loss. The disappointing financial results are the latest in a string of poor performances, with losses of $134 million and $68.2 million in the first quarter of 2018 and the third quarter of 2019, respectively. Despite the quarterly loss, Galaxy Digital reported that it had not been that badly affected by the coronavirus crash and has asked all employees to work remotely:“Nonetheless, the Covid-19 pandemic has caused global economic uncertainty and is likely to impact the Company's investments and business activities in the coming months, with offsetting potential benefits to the Company from increased volatility and expansive global monetary and fiscal policy.”Despite the company’s claims of weathering the COVID-19 storm with relatively little turbulence, some reports have suggested that Galaxy Digital has cut its workforce by no less than 15% this year.Crypto markets are buffeted about by myriad factors, as well as deep philosophical divides. Regardless of whether or not the philosophical diversity of investors is a good thing, those who had hoped prices would skyrocket when traditional markets were in dire straits were left disappointed. So too were those who maintain crypto, notably Bitcoin, as a store of value above anything else.Prices have crept up again, but they took a battering along with traditional markets in the initial stages of the pandemic’s unstoppable spread, leading some to argue that cryptocurrencies are now largely correlated assets. But the question of whether crypto banks are better or worse off in times of crisis has sparked debate among investors and observers alike.Mathias Imbach, the co-founder of Sygnum — a major institutional crypto bank — and CEO of its Singapore branch, told Cointelegraph that instability equally affects both traditional financial markets and digital asset markets, but this does not necessarily have a uniquely negative effect:“The fragility of the current system could also drive further interest in digital assets, which has historically demonstrated a low correlation to traditional asset classes (with the exclusion of immediate sell-offs during market shocks), and offers a potential hedge to financial markets. Empirical data from last month on our platform sustains this argument.”Bill Zielke, the chief marketing officer of BitPay, a United States-based Bitcoin payment service provider, said that neither the nature of cryptocurrencies themselves nor the coronavirus were notably risky for the firm:“We do understand that that crypto has a risk with price fluctuations, but BitPay’s business model is to remove that risk for merchants along with fraud and identity theft found with traditional credit cards. Merchants receive the full value of the purchase minus BitPay’s 1% fee.”Due to the uneven and rapid spread of the coronavirus around the world, businesses and governments alike have responded in different ways. One thing interesting to note is that crypto and blockchain businesses were often quick to implement protective measures. Many of the crypto conferences that took place around the world prior to the current state of the nearly global shutdown were marked by absences and low attendance, with travel bans being put in place and companies jumping to battle stations preemptively.The digital asset bank Sygnum was one such company, telling Cointelegraph that management has put in place an action plan to protect employees and customers, stabilize operations, plan profit and loss scenarios, defend revenue loss driven by the macroenvironment, and plan potential cost takeouts to conserve cash. Sygnum’s Imbach explained to Cointelegraph that, as the company operates in fully decentralized mode, it has been able to continue operations under lockdown conditions. Imbach said that since the crisis began, it has actually witnessed increased customer demand and has continued to launch new products:“As a natively digital business we have been able to continue normal operations in decentralised mode, with our team across Switzerland and Singapore working remotely. We are still launching new products, and clients can onboard digitally or access our services through an e-banking portal.”Monolith, a decentralized banking company based in the United Kingdom, is another company that is seeing the bright side of the rapidly developing financial crisis. A spokesperson for the company said that because this is not a traditional bear market, it is not witnessing the usual behavior. By offering a variety of digital assets, the spokesperson told Cointelegraph that crypto banks can keep investor capital flowing:“Those who would typically hold, are now seeking more liquidity in their assets as a response to the unpredictable nature of a global systemic problem. Where previously people would look to offset market collapse by committing to mainstream assets, the advent of more current solutions such as stable currencies offer them the hedge they want today using a reliable transacting finance facility.”Like all unexpected, high-impact events, the coronavirus pandemic has left many businesses facing tough decisions. For some, this may mean closure, but Imbach says this difficult climate could serve as a catalyst for positive development in crypto finance:“We believe COVID-19 brings challenges also for us, at the same time it also feels we’re witnessing a ‘fast forward’ mentality, more people thinking about the viability of today’s traditional financial system, many people reviewing their portfolio allocations etc.”Few investors are likely to have forgotten the chaos wrought across global stock exchanges only a few weeks ago. Headlines share the doomsaying prophecies of statisticians and economists about the prospects of many of the world’s most vital economies. But it seems that while many of the key token prices have taken a hammering, it’s not all doom and gloom as far as crypto banking is concerned.Imbach told Cointelegraph that the nearly global work-from-home restrictions have actually led to an increase in customer onboarding and transaction activity. Imbach added that customers have been increasingly concerned about counterparty risk and the degree to which their assets are segregated, along with having questions about Bitcoin as digital gold and requests for information about asset reallocation.Imbach also mentioned that geographic sensitivity has increased, taking into account the regulatory status of counterparties, adding that this has come to be a major differentiating factor for Sygnum as both a regulated Swiss bank and a capital markets services licensed entity in Singapore. Imbach said that he has witnessed a change in managerial behavior among clients, which is perhaps not unusual given the unique stresses faced by many companies, adding that: “We do not believe that current events will reduce institutional investors’ interest in digital assets mid-term, on the contrary.”A spokesperson for Monolith told Cointelegraph that the firm views the current climate as an opportunity for crypto banks to offer decentralized solutions to clients in order to help them manage their funds more effectively. The firm also added that while it is witnessing an increase in stablecoins flowing into the platform, customers are not spending them at the rate they used to:“This crisis has created an alignment between users searching for better options to save and DeFi offering them a more sustainable way to do so. Behavior on our platform has reflected this movement in a few unique ways. [...] Where previously people would use our platform to load their Monolith VISA card to spend, they are now using it to hedge. This behavior of converting into fiat and holding is not something we’ve witnessed in the past, and though a byproduct of circumstance, also shows faith in our feasibility as a genuine alternative to traditional banks.”Conversely, Bitpay’s Zielke said its customers are still spending, albeit in an online capacity. Video games, delivery services and domain hosting are the prime areas, which is not entirely surprising given the state of lockdown for most customers: “Additionally, people have been buying more gift cards from the BitPay app or gift card sites like eGifter.com for purchases at Amazon, Whole Foods, Uber and Home Depot.” Despite the coronavirus, Zielke said that the first quarter of 2020 has been an improvement of over nearly 10% in terms of dollar volume as more people stay at home:“Comparing Q4 last year to Q1, 2020, BitPay processed almost 10% more volume ($). Key verticals driving this increase were financial services, currency exchange, computer software & engineering and IT services which saw increases ranging from 11-40%. And crypto is crucial to people who do not have access to credit cards or a bank account.”While many businesses are forced into taking a conservative outlook for future prospects, it seems that at Monolith is confident that the COVID-19 climate is a fertile environment for crypto banking and financial technology innovation:“We currently have the largest holding of crypto that we’ve ever had and are in a strong position to continue innovating for another year and a half, as the dust settles, with no need to touch our crypto reserves.”"

Le is believed to be hiding in either Dubai or Vietnam. OneLink comprises a classic Ponzi scheme, offering no products for affiliates to sell beyond membership in the scheme itself.Members invest into OneLink using the stablecoin Tether (USDT) in exchange for OLX points — with investment packages ranging from $100 to $5,000 on top of a $40 membership fee. Affiliate marketers are promised 10% of the funds invested into the scheme by recruits, with residual commissions from downstream referrals also flaunted to attract marketers.Affiliates are ranked according to volume of investment they can generate from victims, with Rolex watches listed among the bonuses offered to entice prolific marketers.Several leading figures from the OneCoin scam are currently involved in legal proceedings. Co-founder, Karl Greenwood, faces a pre-trial conference in June, and OneCoin lawyer, Mark Scott, faces charges for alleged money laundering, and an ongoing class-action lawsuit.Numerous crypto Ponzi schemes have shuttered over the years, with their principal actors going into hiding.

153,https://cointelegraph.com,,Stablecoins Provide Cover as Global Risks and Uncertainty Quake,https://cointelegraph.com/news/stablecoins-provide-cover-as-global-risks-and-uncertainty-quake,"There is only a finite supply of Bitcoin, too — a restriction not imposed 
on stablecoins. Market cap, of course, has its limitations as a measure 
of ...",,"As the global economy trembles, investors continue to find sanctuary in stablecoins. In the most recent 12-month period (ending April 29, 2020), the three top stablecoins — Tether (USDT), Circle (USDC) and Paxos (PAX) — increased their market capitalization by 161%, 191% and 146%, respectively.","Kim Grauer, head of research at Chainalysis, told Cointelegraph that with the use of a different metric, “We can confirm a 250% increase in the amount of Tether moved on-chain in the past 12-months (ending March 2020),” and the growth isn’t all front-loaded, either. As COVID-19 raged, President Trump declared a national emergency in the United States on March 13, and for that month, the three largest stablecoins each notched month-on-month on-chain growth of 50% or higher. Elsewhere, on March 10, Binance’s new stablecoin (BUSD), created in partnership with Paxos Trust company, crossed the $100 million market cap threshold for the first time since its September debut. Dramatic growth continued through April. On April 29, BUSD’s market cap stood at $194 million, trailing only USDT ($7.52 billion), USDC ($726 million) and PAX ($244 million).  Talking to Cointelegraph, Binance chief compliance officer Samuel Lim shed some light on the likely causes of such growth. “Stablecoins have been used more frequently in trading due to huge market volatility in the past year,” he said, “but apart from that, we have also seen an increase in its public adoption and usage.” In reference to Tether’s growth in particular, Lim added: “The issuance of USDT has increased greatly, but its market share is gradually decreasing, which means other stablecoins have been growing phenomenally — not to mention that it [USDT] may face potential competition from CBDCs [central bank digital currencies] or even the likes of Libra.”Are other industry representatives confounded by the continued growth? “It’s not surprising to me,” Cred CEO Dan Schatt told Cointelegraph, “we’ll see more of this, with the current state of the financial markets. There is a strong interest in the dollar, and it’s much easier to acquire dollars through crypto assets.”COVID-19 has done nothing to disrupt stablecoins’ advance on non-pegged digital coins (i.e., non-stablecoin crypto). “Compared to the top 5 non-stablecoin assets (BTC, ETH, LTC, BCH, and XRP), the stablecoins we track saw higher month-over-month growth from February to March in terms of on-chain transaction volume,” Grauer told Cointelegraph. She elaborated, “The flight to stablecoins suggests that people may be deliberately looking to store value in traditional fiat assets, namely the USD.” Adding to this sentiment, Gregory Klumov, CEO of Stasis, which issues the EURS stablecoin, told Cointelegraph:“You can track the outstanding circulating amount of issued stablecoins, and during the first wave of a crypto market correction in early March, there was a significant issuance of stablecoins. That’s exactly the outcome that is expected: people were relocating to stablecoins, reducing the volatility of their crypto portfolio.”A flight to safety is one common explanation. But there may be other considerations amid the coronavirus pandemic, some even hygienic, as Klumov went on to add, “People may start treating things they touch differently. For example, they will prefer to make digital payments and perform cashless interaction.” This is a significant trend for stablecoins in his view. Users can download crypto wallet apps and “get a checking account in dollars or euros by receiving and sending the same stablecoins.”Asked to explain the recent stablecoin upsurge, Preston Byrne, partner at law firm Anderson Kill, told Cointelegraph, “It’s because people want dollars, and stablecoins are one form of exposure to dollars in places that don’t have direct access to the U.S. banking system or the means of holding physical cash.” Not all stablecoins are created equally, though, “There are really two different types of stablecoins: audited schemes, like Paxos and Circle, and unaudited ones like Tether,” Byrne said, adding:“Paxos and Circle have likely seen increased adoption by market participants looking for a crypto-native alternative to ACH [automated clearing house] to make payments and settle debts, or simply a quick and easy way to convert crypto to USD. Tether’s market cap has ballooned to the stratosphere, but until Tether passes an audit conducted by a reputable firm, prudence dictates that I can’t believe their numbers.”Byrne has been critical of stablecoins in the past, especially crypto-collateralized stablecoins (such as DAI), which he once described as “the perpetual motion machines of modern finance.” He also wrote, “A stablecoin that is collateralized by itself is a complex and fragile ‘Nakamoto Scheme’ doomed to fail.” Asked about this, Byrne said, “Stablecoins that fail to do those things or which cut corners on regulatory compliance are a bad idea,” further sharing with Cointelegraph:“DAI faces numerous compliance challenges, starting with money services business licensing and continuing to a total lack of investor protections, as seen in recent events where DAI CDP [collateralized debt position] holders got wiped out due to a black swan drop in the price of Ether and network failure. That wouldn’t happen with a Paxos or a Gemini.”For the record, DAI’s market capitalization increased by 38% over the past 12 months, which would be enviable growth under most circumstances, though it now pales beside the increases exceeding 140% notched by the top three stablecoins over the same period. Moreover, Alex Melikhov, CEO of Equilibrium — which issues EOSDT, a decentralized stablecoin — told Cointelegraph that centralized stablecoins like Tether, USDC and PAX have their own black swan risks. The banks that hold their currency’s cash reserves could fail. Decentralized stablecoins, by comparison, are transparently backed by cryptocurrency that is sitting in smart contracts. Melikhov added, “These stablecoins are dependent only on the [underlying] technology and its embedded algorithms. They are free from third-party risk and may be even safer than their centralized analogs.” Tether, of course, remains the gorilla in the room, with a market cap more than eight times that of the number two stablecoin. Regarding Tether, Grauer noted: “We see interesting technical and economic trends that may be related to this surge. Technically, most of the growth in Tether activity can be attributed to Tether on the Ethereum blockchain. In March 2020, over 90% of Tether transactions were settled on the Ethereum blockchain whereas just under 19% were settled there in April 2019.”She added that 65% of Tether value was transferred in transactions that were over $100,000 each. “This confirms some speculation that a large source of the demand for Tether likely comes from professionals, probably based in China, where there is no fiat available to onramp into the crypto market.” Approximately 50% of Tether’s activity in March was sourced directly to China-based exchanges Huobi and OKEX, added Grauer, while Binance sourced nearly 30% of the Tether present on the Ethereum blockchain.What, if anything, could derail stablecoin growth? “Most of the Tether demand is coming from the Asia region,” continued Grauer, “so a future regulatory crackdown could be felt by stablecoin users. But we have seen a resilience to these types of moves in the APAC region.” When the Chinese government banned the use of yuan for crypto purchases, for instance, many users simply shifted to Tether. On the matter, Lim believes that:“Either way we believe they [i.e., stable and non-stable coins] can coexist, as their target audience might even be different. And needless to say, the crypto market is still very small when compared to the traditional fiat market. All it takes is for a small percentage of the flow of funds from the traditional world to enter this space and we will see a tremendous explosion of growth and adoption in our industry.”Schatt added that more stablecoins are now emerging with higher standards and that are truly substantiated 1:1 with auditable transparency pages. He went on to say, “Those that cannot obtain a certain level of liquidity, transparency and auditability will be more susceptible to market crashes.” Speaking hypothetically, Melikhov believes that a failure of Tether could still have a drastic impact on the crypto sphere, “but the stablecoins market is slowly becoming more diversified as existing Tether alternatives become more mature.” In the future, a major stablecoin failure could simply result in the rise of an alternative stablecoin project — that is, one to take its place, he suggested. Should the current run continue, can the stablecoins’ collective market capitalization eventually surpass that of Bitcoin, currently at $165 billion? “It’s possible,” said Schatt, “as we are already seeing more use cases for stablecoins — settlement of M&A and POS transactions. Connecting stablecoins to the several trillion dollar retail commerce market can significantly light up the prospect for stablecoins.” Lim, on the other hand, told Cointelegraph that “It is too early to tell,” adding: “Stablecoins are a bridge between the traditional fiat world and the crypto world, and we are all aware the fiat world is significantly larger. There is certainly room for growth within the stablecoins space and we strongly believe demand will only grow larger as institutional interest begins to pick up.”There is only a finite supply of Bitcoin, too — a restriction not imposed on stablecoins. Market cap, of course, has its limitations as a measure of size or success, especially if governments enter the stablecoin arena. “If China or the U.S. create their own stablecoin, you will see how it is easy for them to overcome the market capitalization of Bitcoin,” Paolo Ardoino, chief technical officer at Bitfinex exchange, told Cointelegraph. “It is probably more meaningful to look at the amount of on-chain activity that we see, and right now stablecoins account for less than half of the activity of Bitcoin,” suggested Grauer. In any event, “the success of stablecoins and the success of other cryptocurrencies are not separate stories; they support each other,”she said."

Interestingly, the exchange warns users that it does not intend to resume the trading of the Grin (GRIN)/Bitcoin (BTC) pair, which is apparently the root of the malfunction.Poloniex resumed activity before going into maintenance mode again about an hour later. Once it resumed trading for good, its announcement read:“All markets except GRIN/BTC are now re-enabled for full trading. Our initial maintenance was related to our GRIN/BTC maintenance earlier today. Following that, we began experiencing issues with one of our service providers. We will provide updates once everything is resolved.”As of press time, Poloniex did not answer Cointelegraph’s press inquiry.Some Twitter users asked Poloniex how they can withdraw their Grin holdings from the platform, apparently showing fear that the exchange’s Grin wallet was compromised. Still, a cybercriminal emptying the exchange’s Grin wallet appears unlikely if one considers that only the GRIN/BTC trading pair was suspended, while GRIN/USDT trading continues as usual.Furthermore, many Twitter users voiced their frustration over the unscheduled maintenance, with some suggesting that it is malicious in nature. One Twitter user commented:“It’s always the case, maintenance is always at the time when BTC is moving, lost enough since [the] market was going down and wanted to cut my long. [I’ll] never use this site again for my trading.”Unscheduled maintenance is not too uncommon among cryptocurrency exchanges. This is thanks in part to the space being young and the infrastructure being still under development. As Cointelegraph reported in February, Binance ran into a number of performance issues as well. The also halted trading for unscheduled maintenance on Feb. 19 and again at the beginning of March.At the time, Binance CEO, Changpeng Zhao, refused technical help from the CEO of competing exchange OKEx, Jay Hao, and blocked him on Twitter. Later that same month, OKEx only gave its users a few hours notice before undergoing maintenance in the midst of significant market volatility."

The market is now highly diverse. For example, audited stablecoins, along with fixed use digital cash projects introduced by Wells Fargo and JP Morgan last year, stand in stark contrast to cryptocurrencies that fluctuate as much as 10% a day. The ultimate sign of graduation from the margins into the mainstream, however, is perhaps the way that central banks are now embracing the technology.","Central bank digital currencies are now in active pilot programs by many central banks across the world (see our recent report here). The People’s Bank of China has embarked on its own “digital yuan” project and Sweden’s central bank, Sveriges Riksbank, has announced a pilot for a digital version of its currency for retail use, dubbed the e-krona.Additionally, the United States Federal Reserve, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank are all currently exploring the technology. Meanwhile, the Bank for International Settlements — the so-called “central banks’ central bank” — has been discussing CBDCs at length and recently forecasted that amid the current global pandemic, contaminated bills may be the catalyst for central banks to deliver a digital cash alternative for payments.Why else are central banks, the heart of the economic establishment, so interested in technology with such radical and revolutionary roots?In part, they have been responding to challenges from private sector initiatives, such as Facebook’s Libra. However, CBDCs also potentially offer substantial benefits for general purpose use, which make them highly attractive in their own right. Specifically, central banks’ motivations include:What’s interesting about the recent models is the collaborative approach many have been taking with a supporting cast from the private sector. For example, the Bank of England has been researching what it calls the “platform model,” in which the bank is the only entity allowed to create or destroy a token, while leaving payment interface providers to interact with end-users.The proposal gives PIPs the responsibility to maintain Know Your Customer checks, while providing them with the freedom to differentiate themselves by providing additional services on top of the core payments.Others have gone a step further. Researchers at the IMF have recently coined the term “synthetic CBDC” to describe a model, in which a non-central bank entity, such as a commercial bank, can issue a stablecoin backed by central bank reserves.Ultimately, we are likely to see a variety of uses for CBDCs in the retail space and a number of different implementations. These will have important benefits for a wide variety of institutions from corporate treasury departments to payment networks open to the general public. We have been witnessing the distinction quickly blurring between the currently evolving retail CBDC models and previous projects with wholesale CBDCs. We have already learned that a CBDC is a great tool at the wholesale level, and its applications can teach us a lot about the prospects for retail CBDCs. For example:Blockchain technology is crucial in enabling the tokenization of these payment assets, allowing for peer-to-peer transactions and distributed custody. Additionally, blockchain tech enables atomic transactions, which means that any delivery versus payment or PvP scenario can occur, in real time, without the risk that one leg of the transaction will be executed before the other.Blockchain technology also sets the architecture for a more secure payment system, in which there is no centralized point of failure nor honeypot for hackers to attack. Finally, it allows connectivity into a growing tokenized financial ecosystem with global integrity.Looking forward, we can imagine a completely new architecture for money in the near future, which will, in many ways, be as significant a change to the nature of money as the invention of the credit card. This architecture is enabled by blockchain technology as a system of record and relies on central banks’ diligence in providing robust governance frameworks for these new assets.Widespread access to CBDCs will be key for central banks to fulfill their mandate of offering modern payment solutions. Additionally, it will catalyze the connectivity among the general public, corporations and the financial industry with parallel innovations currently being built out by firms leveraging blockchain technology in non-payment-related areas. Central banks have a tremendous opportunity to orchestrate and provide purchasing power into this ecosystem.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.George Calle is the market intelligence lead at R3, an enterprise blockchain software firm.

The researchers were not permitted to purchase the item so were unable to assess the authenticity of such items.Titled “Availability of COVID-19 related products on Tor darknet markets” the report stated that “crime follows opportunity and the COVID-19 pandemic offers profiteering arising from shortages and fear”. While some were quick to jump on the financial opportunities presented by the pandemic — the products surveyed were valued at $240,000 USD — the fact that almost half were devoid of such listings may suggest some darknet operators have more scruples than is commonly believed.Speaking to Cointelegraph, study author Professor Roderic Broadhurst speculated on the absence of COVID-19 related products on certain sites:“Basically different markets view risk differently. Many already ban products like child abuse materials and certain drugs/poisons/etc and so ethics [are] also relevant. Of course some markets have no such scruples and may consider themselves bullet proof.”Of course many darknet markets happily sell drugs, weapons and trade in stolen credit cards and personal information.

mining difficulty through the roof, first igniting the hardware arms 
race ...",,"This week marked the launch of Binance Pool, a mining platform powered by one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges. Coming less than a month after Binance’s CEO Changpeng Zhao confirmed rumors of this forthcoming addition to his brainchild company’s product family, the announcement paints the new mining pool as the bridge between “traditional mining and financial services.” The lowest fees in the market and seamless integration with a full suite of Binance’s financial products are the major selling points meant to lure miners.","The news reinvigorated the debate about how big a crypto company can get before the community is justified in throwing the dreaded “c-word” (centralization, that is) at it. For Binance, criticism has been mounting up as of late.Even before the mining pool came about, the company stirred controversy by extending its influence into the field of crypto data aggregation with the acquisition of one of the industry’s favorite token price hubs, CoinMarketCap. On top of that, the newly published outline of Binance’s prospective Smart Chain drew some sharp criticism in part for its governance mechanism’s alleged proneness to centralization. Is Binance crossing the line, becoming too big for an industry founded on the vision of disrupting centralized power structures?Long gone are the times when geeky crypto enthusiasts could run a lucrative mining operation from their own garage, using only a repurposed antiquated PC. The spikes in Bitcoin’s popularity and market capitalization have driven mining difficulty through the roof, first igniting the hardware arms race that had led to the triumph of application-specific integrated circuits and then rendering individual home-based mining all but untenable altogether.In order to have at least a realistic shot at a slice of the block rewards, miners were driven to consolidate their computing power in pools, divvying up the spoils according to individual hash rate contributions. In addition to hardware and electricity costs, some mining pools also charge fees for participation.Crypto exchanges stood to gain a lot from entering into the mining scene, and so they did. The hallmark of an exchange-powered pool, as it is explained in Binance’s blog, is that “rewards go directly to the participants’ exchange accounts,” rather than to individual miners’ wallets, as in traditional mining pools. This seemingly trivial distinction makes a world of difference that can be summarized in one word: liquidity. Adam Traidman, the CEO and co-founder of BRD, a global company that specializes in blockchain-enabled financial services, told Cointelegraph:“Apart from obvious benefits, such as revenues and increased decentralization of mining, exchanges are getting into mining [to generate] liquidity for market making. Relying on external miners and other sources for this has proven troublesome in many cases due to lack of adherence to existing liquidity contracts during times of hyper volatility.”The first entrants among big-name crypto exchanges — Huobi and OKEx — have done exceptionally well from the very start of their respective inroads into mining pool business. Huobi Pool reported a 547% surge in its operational revenue from 2018 to 2019 — from $53 to $320 million. For OKEx Pool, it took three months from its launch in August 2019 to make the top-five mining conglomerates by hash rate. At the time of writing, OKEx and Huobi Pools rank eighth and ninth by Bitcoin blocks found, respectively.Another reward that awaits big players who command massive audiences is a chance to make the most of the user base while expanding the range of products offered within their ecosystem — which is the strategy that the most successful information technology companies employ across the board.Offering users a bundle of products allows tech powerhouses to maintain horizontal growth even as they approach the ceiling in their respective primary markets. Incentivizing existing customers to subscribe for adjacent apps and services in their ecosystem is great for retaining and expanding a loyal customer base while offering them convenient synergies and perks.Look no further than Google, which has Gmail, Youtube, Chrome, Maps and a host of other widely popular services to complement its original value proposition, the web search engine. Every industry leader strives to be to their respective sector what Google is to the internet at large.For a while, arguably the only viable candidate for this distinction in the context of digital asset space has been Coinbase, a company boasting both retail and professional crypto trading platforms, a wallet and a custodial service. Conceived five years after Coinbase’s 2012 debut — an eternity-sized handicap in the world of digital money — Binance appears determined to mount a challenge.Capturing a share of the mining pie is a logical step, as Richie Lai, a co-founder of the cryptocurrency exchange Bittrex, observed to Cointelegraph: “Exchanges are trying different ways to augment their business models, and mining is a natural adjacency that exchanges may consider adding to their portfolio of products.” Alexander Blum, the COO and co-founder of the digital asset firm Two Prime, commented on Binance’s strategy:“With a captive user base using Binance’s financial services, the mining pool simply offers an additional way to further monetize their audience. Notice that Binance is not mining itself but, instead, offering rent-seeking software services at a 2.5% fee of mining rewards (after the 0% promotion expires in May). In comparison to competing mining pools, the ability to offer promotions for loyalty and a one-stop-shop for trading, lending and savings accounts with a trusted brand will make this a competitive offering.”As the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume is entering the new sector, it proclaims an ambitious agenda of innovation, increased profitability for market participants, and decentralization of hashing power distribution.Speaking to Cointelegraph, Lisa He, the head of Binance Pool, shared a vision of the new platform where “retail and small-scale operations to institutional and professional miners alike” would profit from a range of exchange-backed financial tools, such as futures, options, savings, pool lending and more. Commenting on the concerns related to the potential centralization of mining power at Binance Pool’s hands, she argued that adding a new major player into the mix would have the opposite effect:“By creating the Binance Pool, we’re aiming to change the distribution of hash rate across all the different mining pools and expect many users of the competing mining pools to transfer their hash rate to our platform. This will result in more decentralization, not less.”Therefore, are fears of centralization justifiable? Industry experts whom Cointelegraph surveyed did not sound too worried. Neeraj Khandelwal, the co-founder of India-based cryptocurrency exchange CoinDCX, noted:“While it is true that the entry of large global exchanges to the mining sector will likely see them continue to dominate a part of the BTC mining industry globally, I believe that such concerns are potentially overblown. Binance entering the space may actually have the effect of increasing the level of competition we see between BTC mining pools — reducing levels of centralization.”Khandelwal explained that it is unlikely that one or several dominant mining powers would want to conspire and carry out a 51% attack — even having a capacity to do so — due to both the difficulty of such a collaboration and the fact that compromising the Bitcoin network this way would amount to shooting themselves in the foot.Traidman is also skeptical of the immediate risks of increasing centralization, as it would be irrational to attack the network: “The value of the assets on the chain would go to near zero since it would essentially be invalidated. Therefore, the risk of centralization due to a 51% attack defeats itself.” Blum commented to the same effect:“Binance’s pool introduces an elevated level of competition that other mining pools will need to compete with through whatever mechanisms they have available to themselves. This will contribute to further decentralization of hash power across newer mining pools.”Blum thinks that the continued growth of institutional miners will offer a bullish impulse for the overall industry, as these collective projects’ capital intensive activity coupled with the imminent halving of block rewards will push Bitcoin prices up so that the miners can post a profit. Lai was also on board, saying: “I think exchanges getting involved in Bitcoin mining may actually help with the threat of BTC centralization.”While the emergence of Binance Pool can be seen as a healthy development that boosts competition in the market at large, existing pools have a reason to become tense. The new player in the field will most likely pursue a strategy of aggressive expansion. Lisa He made no bones about Binance Pool’s plans to eventually capture the dominant share of the hash rate:“Our first goal is to become the mining pool industry leader, and then we will discuss what specific final market share we want to achieve. Right now, the industry leader has a bit over 21 EH/s, and our goal for the next 18 months is to beat that.”In his recent interview with Cointelegraph, Binance’s CEO, CZ, downplayed the narratives of his company getting too big. He credited market processes and users choosing Binance’s products for the company’s explosive growth, noting that it is still very small compared to the flagship corporations of the traditional tech industry.While all this may well be true, there is little doubt that Binance is growing faster than any other leading crypto company in terms of revenues, user base and the range of digital asset-related services on offer. A lot of this will improve the overall quality of global crypto users’ experience, but the community should also remain on the lookout for any potential scenario where consolidated market power can become a problem. After all, the absence of a realistic 51% attack threat does not mean that there are no potential detrimental effects at all.After all, in innovation-heavy industries that fundamentally influence society, a lot of negative externalities are difficult to foresee. Who, in 2008, thought that Facebook would become a prime venue for politically consequential misinformation, or that Google would engender a new brand of media economy based on monetizing user attention?"

It can work in tandem with banks’ existing monitoring tools:“To identify transactions with virtual asset service providers (VASPs), including those with weak KYC or operating as unregistered money service businesses (MSBs).”The press release further says that with the release of Armada, CipherTrace aims to provide:“Critical visibility into risky cryptocurrency blind spots so know your customer (KYC) processes can detect and perform due diligence on virtual asset service providers (VASPs).”In a statement to Cointelegraph, John Jefferies, chief financial analyst for CipherTrace, emphasized that his company has the most accurate data:“CipherTrace has the most accurate data attribution coverage tying real-world entities to crypto addresses, enabling Armada to link banking data and billing descriptors to entities, which is a big differentiator from competitors because it is critical for transaction matching.”According to the company’s press release, Armada can conduct KYC to determine VASPs and unregistered MSBs, enable “enhanced due diligence of high-risk virtual asset payments,” and discover counterparty risk associated with hundreds of such businesses. CipherTrace’s database contains over 500 businesses involved in virtual asset transactions.Jefferies elaborated on how CipherTrace defines “high-risk virtual payments”:“Risky entities include sanctioned entities, known criminal activities and thefts, dark markets, higher-risk exchanges, HYIP scams, malware, ransomware, and mixers.”This news comes days after Andreas Antonopoulos accused companies like CipherTrace of helping: “The world's worst dictators and regimes, either directly or indirectly, with information that violates the civil rights of millions of people.”Responding to Antonopoulos’ accusations, Jefferies stated that CipherTrace’s products aim to disrupt dictators and oppressive regimes:“CipherTrace helps banks and other financial institutions comply with international sanctions, anti-terrorist financing regulations, and AML standards. This type of work is what prevents dictators and oppressive regimes from continuing to fund weapons programs and other destructive enterprises.”For Bitcoin (BTC) to gain wider adoption within the mainstream economy, it will be pressured to conform to the mainstream regulation, which will elicit the wrath of privacy advocates like Antonopoulos. Only time will tell which side of the debate will prevail."
160,https://cointelegraph.com,,"Crypto Joins the Zoom Monetization Call, Blockchain Addresses Key Issues",https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-joins-the-zoom-monetization-call-blockchain-addresses-key-issues,"Bitcoin (BTC) payments are expected to be added in the next quarter. 
SmartSessions works in conjunction with the 2key, Ledger or MetaMask ...",,"As staying home becomes the new normal, the popular video conferencing app Zoom continues to flourish. Despite multiple privacy concerns, on April 21, it was reported that more than 300 million people used Zoom’s flagship video conferencing app.","It’s clear that Zoom still reigns supreme during the coronavirus pandemic, even as Facebook, Google and other tech titans create their own video conferencing alternatives. Nevertheless, a new influx of users means that Zoom is being leveraged for different reasons, including services that individuals would typically pay for.Although Zoom may be accommodating for large group participation, charging users to join Zoom sessions has become a challenge. For instance, the Zoom help center mentions that users can charge registration fees for webinars using PayPal, but it’s not clear how service providers can monetize through personal Zoom sessions. Erez Ben Kiki, the founder and CEO of 2key Network, told Cointelegraph that as coronavirus prevails, there is now a need to integrate payment methods into Zoom meetings:“With over 15 thousand users on the 2key network, we’ve received a lot of demand to create a product that enables small- to medium-sized business owners the option to integrate payment management methods directly into their Zoom accounts. We also want to provide the option to activate built-in self-managed referral campaigns in Zoom sessions.”According to Kiki, receiving payments through PayPal only works using the Zoom Webinar product, which is reserved for premium user accounts, adding that monetizing services hosted on Zoom has always been a challenge, as “attendees would have to either be billed individually or make payments made using PayPal or a bank transfer.”However, 2key Network has developed a product called SmartSessions that allows Zoom users with free accounts to create a cryptocurrency paywall for their video conferencing sessions. Kiki noted that SmartSessions connects directly to Zoom’s API and is deployed on the Ethereum blockchain as a layer-two solution.The product, which launched last week, has been designed specifically for Zoom users to generate revenue in cryptocurrency from viewers accessing their live-streamed sessions. “No coding skills are required to get SmartSessions up and running,” Kiki added.According to Kiki, there are a number of benefits a blockchain-based paywall system can provide for video conferencing platforms like Zoom. He explained that receiving payments in cryptocurrencies makes it easier for individuals who offer professional services on Zoom to avoid banking restrictions and additional payment fees. “This is especially useful if attendees are based in different countries,” he pointed out.Currently, SmartSessions allows users to accept payments in Ether (ETH). However, Kiki noted that next month, the platform will accommodate stablecoins including Tether (USDT), Dai (DAI) and TrueUSD (TUSD). Bitcoin (BTC) payments are expected to be added in the next quarter.SmartSessions works in conjunction with the 2key, Ledger or MetaMask crypto wallets. Once a user’s account has been connected to their wallet, a smart contract is created to automatically collect all the registration fees from session attendees. Kiki added:“Account owners can withdraw funds from their dashboard directly to their wallet. We are also working on supporting auto swapping of crypto to stablecoins. Although payments are made in cryptocurrency, barriers to entry are lowered as crypto can be purchased using a credit card from within 2key — 17 different fiat currencies are currently supported.”Additionally, each transaction made on the SmartSessions network is recorded on the Ethereum blockchain, which means information is transparent and immutable, giving users access to their payment history that cannot be altered.However, while blockchain technology does bring a number of benefits to video conferencing platforms, there are still challenges. For instance, Kiki explained that some users have been hesitant to receive crypto payments, even with the implementation of a credit card solution. He also pointed out that the smart contract deployment fee needs to be solved moving forward.It’s important to note that security issues are still present with blockchain-based solutions. While Kiki explained that SmartSessions generates fully decentralized links to ensure that video calls are not disrupted by unwanted parties joining the call — a major problem Zoom users have recently been encountering — and security experts have pointed out that decentralization is not enough. Reuben Yap, the project steward at a privacy-oriented cryptocurrency Zcoin (XZC), told Cointelegraph that decentralization does not necessarily result in secure communication methods:“Blockchain’s main benefit is that there’s no central authority. This alone does nothing to secure communications, which is Zoom’s main issue. The key issues are scalable end-to-end encryption, which is already hard to do.”Echoing Yap, Stanford University cryptography Ph.D. student Ben Fisch told Cointelegraph that blockchain technology isn’t at all relevant for video conferencing platforms:“Video conferencing platforms are centralized communication systems that are often collecting information from users and then misusing that data. All of these issues can be solved by peer-to-peer collaboration systems or end-to-end encryption. We need to utilize cryptography to solve security challenges, rather than blockchain systems.”Fish explained that blockchains are simply databases that combine cryptography, consensus protocols and decentralized governance. “All of these are separate from the issues users are experiencing with video communication. End-to-end encryption is the only solution,” he added. Ankit Bhatia, a co-founder and the CEO of Sapien Network, also told Cointelegraph that encryption is indeed the only solution that will help keep video conferencing data secure:“Upgrading from the outdated AES-128 to AES-256 will make Zoom data exponentially more secure — it was boneheaded not to use this widely accepted standard for encryption. Introducing end-to-end encryption would be helpful for protecting Zoom data.”Yet, this is easier said than done as Bhatia further explained that vulnerable access points are an additional issue affecting data security on platforms like Zoom, adding:“Zoom ultimately needs to change how it creates ‘meetings’ — Google Meet can generate fresh links continuously, while Zoom creates fixed meeting rooms, making it extremely easy to guess meeting room numbers if you have the right tool. Password protection needs to be on by default, and Zoom should explore other forms of authentication (2FA, MFA, SSO) to protect the integrity of meetings.”Security issues aside, Kiki remains optimistic about the SmartSessions solution, predicting that it will assist many entrepreneurs and small- to medium-sized organizations that have been affected by COVID-19:“SmartSessions will provide new income and scaling opportunities for many businesses impacted by COVID19 that have now turned to Zoom to conduct business online. We plan to continue improving the product and its functionality while adding more features like support for additional currencies and the ability to connect with more live video providers.”"

Bitcoin (BTC) reached in 2017, along with those who bought in too ...",,"Ripple has long occupied a controversial position in the cryptocurrency industry. The ascension of Ripple’s in-house token, XRP, to the position of the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap was enough validation for some that the company was set to play a major role in the industry for many years to come. However, since those halcyon days, momentum has slowed, and aside from a few notable blips, the company has been dogged by rumors and a steady decline in XRP’s value.","Because of the ambitious philosophical goals at the heart of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, it is not uncommon to see investors who favor one particular token, battling it out behind their keyboards on social media. XRP’s defenders were among the most vocal. But it seems that the token’s “XRP Army” is struggling to fill the ranks. According to a new study by social trading and investing platform eToro and crypto data provider The Tie, which indicated that discussion of XRP fell 16% in the first quarter of 2020. While it’s important to note that Twitter mentions ebb and flow according to a huge variety of market movements and company activity, the report found that the number of users in the so-called XRP Army has declined by a mammoth 82% since January 2018. The token’s social media activity woes, however, don’t end there. A list of Telegram groups compiled by a Twitter user on April 15 showed that over 63% of @Ripple members had left since June 2018. Mohamed Zidan, the chief market strategist of ThinkMarkets, told Cointelegraph that XRP has struggled to find a function in the cryptosphere and put forward his view that faith in the token is wavering: “Believers in XRP and other cryptos diminished gradually, and few people still believe in it. It was important to witness how the markets reacted to cryptocurrencies during coronavirus pandemic. It proved that it can’t be a safe haven but more as a risky asset. The current stagnation and low volumes suggest that its place in the financial equation is yet to be found.”One of the most common criticisms leveled at Ripple is the high quantity of XRP token liquidations. While the liquidations had previously been something that privately riled many crypto investors, few people thought to take action into their own hands. The first time crypto companies come up against significant legal challenges is usually after an initial coin offering. Due to the lack of clarity about how to regulate cryptocurrencies, many new projects are accused of falling foul of the Securities Act — and Ripple is no exception. Originally filed as a class-action lawsuit in May 2018, alleging that Ripple had violated the Securities Act through a 2013 ICO, with the March 25 amended complaint accusing Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse of misleading investors about the attractiveness of XRP while secretly liquidating his holdings.The amended complaint alleges that the CEO put forward a bullish outlook to investors, presenting himself as “very, very, very long” and “on the HODL side” about XRP during 2017. Despite Garlinhouse’s positive online posts, the plaintiffs accuse him of having sold 67 million XRP during 2017, further adding that he was liquidating tokens only days after he received them from Ripple.One of the foremost criticisms of cryptocurrencies is that they have no intrinsic value. While most people who invested money in digital assets have a vested interest in arguing that they do. It seems like the plaintiffs are now disillusioned regarding the token’s actual worth: “All 100 billion of the XRP in existence were created out of thin air by Ripple at its inception in 2013 before any distribution and without functionality except as a speculative investment.”Plaintiffs also asserted that the company’s own funds were greatly overshadowed by the XRP owned by the defendants, arguing that Ripple’s own valuation rests largely on the value of the tokens it owns and sells: “The value of XRP owned by defendants substantially exceeds the value of Ripple’s revenue or cash flow from all other sources. Ripple’s dominant value proposition is the XRP tokens it owns and sells. Ripple’s value proposition as a company depends upon the promotion of XRP, yet XRP is entirely or essentially pre-functional and purchased by investors in anticipation of profit based on the efforts of Ripple.” ThinkMarkets’s Zidan outlined his view to Cointelegraph that liquidations aim to bolster the cash position of the firm in order to create a justification for its high valuation but added that further liquidations should be expected: “The liquidation aims to strengthen the cash position of the company and try to adjust its financial position for the valuation. XRP liquidations are likely to continue along with other cryptocurrencies. If you want that to stop or at least slow down, you need to provide a real value.”The plaintiffs also questioned the way, in which both Ripple and Garlinghouse had represented XRP, arguing that any claims for the token as having utility as a “bridge currency” were simply to avoid classification as a security, per the class action suit:“These claims are misrepresentations and omissions of material facts to investors because the utility of XRP (or lack thereof) is pertinent to the value of XRP. Simply stated, these false claims about XRP’s utility are nothing but an attempt to avoid the application of securities laws and drive demand for XRP.”The Tie reported that the firm relied on XRP liquidations to stay cash-flow positive in 2019: “While Ripple liquidated only $13M worth of its XRP holdings in Q4 2019 (the least in three years), it sold over $250M worth in Q3 of last year. It is not yet known how much XRP Ripple sold in Q1 2020.”Ripple’s attempt to have the case dismissed was thwarted by United States District Judge Phyllis Hamilton, who allowed it to move forward in February. The case progression, however, came with a caveat. Hamilton requested that the plaintiffs explain their views that Ripple made fraudulent claims in greater detail, citing a number of accusations in the case that were too general in scope.For many years, the very concept of cryptocurrency lurked in the shadows, existing as whispers in exchanges between ambitious and politically-driven enthusiasts who dreamed of a better financial system. Among the masses, cryptocurrencies are remembered for the price levels Bitcoin (BTC) reached in 2017, along with those who bought in too late and are still waiting to cash in at a profit. Despite tough conditions, many companies have managed to cling on until now. According to ThinkMarkets’s Zidan, the time for companies such as Ripple that rely on their tokens could be running out: “XRP is neither a yielding asset nor a trusted safe haven. So, what drives its value? It was only the crypto craze that managed to drive its price soaring. If we look at Ripple only as a cryptocurrency provider, then it derives its value only from XRP, which technically, has no intrinsic value as a store of value. The intrinsic value will be derived from the ability of the company to generate a sustainable income through the coming years.”While Zidan had a conservative outlook for the prospects of XRP, he told Cointelegraph that it is still worth noting that the company is able to raise hundreds of millions of dollars in funding rounds — which helps boost its valuation: “The main drivers for disappointing numbers in sales in Q4 2019 were decline in institutional sales and pause in programmatic sales (sales to exchanges). However, the company successfully raised $200 million in a Series C round, which makes the firm value flirting at $10B, and that reflects there are still interest in a company but lower value.”Many critics over the years have said that high crypto prices were simply a bubble, and it appears that Zidan, to an extent, agrees with them. Zidan explained to Cointelegraph that he thinks high prices are a hangover from 2017 and that companies such as Ripple need to find other ways to create use cases for their currencies in lieu of a lack of intrinsic value: “The decline may be considered as a means of reverting to normal growth in the industry as clearly, the crypto craze that we witnessed during 2017 is over, back then XRP and other cryptocurrencies looked like a get-rich-quick scheme. But with time, it becomes obvious that it was a bubble and to focus more on how sustainable the income stream for the company. I think they should be focused on payment solutions, although it won’t be easy to compete with other well-established companies like PayPal and others.”"

The integration was announced alongside Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH).As indicated by Tron, the Samsung store will feature “applications like Blockchain Cuties, Super Player, Meerkat Mining and Timeloop.”It is worth noting that Blockchain Cuties is a multi-platform game that reports having more users on Ethereum, though it sees more transactions on Tron. Super Player appears to be an Ethereum-only project for now, according to Dappradar.com.The remaining two apps aren’t present on any DApp aggregation platform. Even if this is not an exhaustive list, it is unclear what criteria will be followed when including DApps.The Samsung Galaxy Store itself is an alternative app store for Samsung devices. Alongside general Android apps found on Google Play Store, it features many custom-tailored apps for the Korean company’s devices.These DApps will be available on Samsung devices in the United States, Canada, South Korea, Australia, the Philippines, Singapore and “some countries in Europe.” It appears that the availability is not universal in those markets, with Tron disclaiming that availability “varies by carrier, market and device.”As reported by Cointelegraph in January, Tron was dominated by gambling DApps throughout 2019. A look at Dappradar’s ranking page for Tron shows that gambling apps still account for a majority of the ecosystem in terms of user count.In terms of volume, however, the Just DApp has shot up the charts with over $3.5 million in transacted value. This appears to be a rebrand of Djed, a clone of MakerDAO that launched in March. The volume is coming from just under 300 weekly users, suggesting that large TRX stakeholders are participating.Tron is a controversial project and its actions continue to polarize the community. Its latest scandal involves the purchase of Steemit Inc., the company behind the Steem project. As the community rebelled against the takeover, allegations of centralization continue.According to a former Steem validator, Justin Sun is bribing the community into placing favorable validators in the Steem delegated proof-of-stake system."

However, at the time of press, no one who has been in the United States in the last 14 days — the Dash Core Group is based in Phoenix — will be granted entry to Japan due to COVID-19 travel restrictions.DASH, a privacy-focused cryptocurrency, was systematically delisted from many crypto exchanges in Japan starting in 2018, including by major exchange Coincheck. According to Suda, this removal was based on a “shared misunderstanding” by Japanese regulators that “Dash’s blockchain is private, untraceable, and cannot be audited.”Although there are no specific laws or guidelines in Japan prohibiting DASH by name, the Japan Virtual Currency Exchange Association (JVCEA) has issued guidelines that effectively shut out the cryptocurrency from all local exchanges. These include regulations on difficult-to-trace cryptocurrencies, digital assets that are difficult to audit, and those at risk of violating anti-money laundering (AML) and anti-terrorist financing (ATF) laws“As of March 2020, there are 21 registered and licensed exchanges in Japan, however none of these exchanges have Dash listed on their platforms. This means that residents of Japan have no legal way to purchase Dash”The submitted proposal will send memorandums written by lawyers and CPAs to other registered crypto exchanges in Japan — 23 at the time of writing — the JVCEA, and the country’s Financial Services Agency. The last is responsible for amendments to regulations of digital assets under the The Payment Services Act and Financial Instruments and Exchange Act, set to be enforced in Japan starting on Friday, May 1."

identities ... in Bitcoin after being infected by Sodinokibi on new year's 
eve 2020.",,Slovakian cybersecurity firm ESET has reported some success in disrupting the workings of a previously undetected Monero (XMR)-mining botnet in Latin America.,"In an announcement on April 23, ESET said the malware had infected over 35,000 computers since May 2019, with 90% of compromised devices located in Peru.ESET researchers have dubbed the botnet VictoryGate, noting that its main activity has been illicit Monero mining — also known as cryptojacking. This is the industry term for stealth crypto-mining attacks that work by installing malware that uses a computer’s processing power to mine for cryptocurrencies without the owner’s consent or knowledge.The firm’s announcement notes that the malware results in extremely high resource usage on infected computers, resulting in a sustained 90–99% CPU load that can lead to overheating and potentially damage the device.The botnet’s propagation vector has been external USB drives, which appear to have files with names and icons that are identical to those contained originally.“However, the original files have been copied to a hidden directory in the root of the drive and Windows executables have been provided as apparent namesakes,” ESET writes.Having detected the botnet, ESET has had some success in disrupting its operations by taking down its command and control (C&C) server and setting up a “sinkhole.” This works to divert requests to an alternative domain name and has enabled ESET to monitor and control the infected hosts.ESET says it is working with the non-profit Shadowserver Foundation to share sinkhole logs and jointly try to mitigate the threat posed by VictoryGate. The researchers emphasized:“Despite our efforts, infected USB drives will continue to circulate and new infections will still occur. The main difference is that the bots will no longer receive commands from the C&C [...] However, those PCs that were infected prior to the disruption may continue to perform cryptomining on behalf of the botmaster.”Users can meanwhile use the firm’s free online scanner if they believe their device has been infected by the botnet.As recently reported, the attackers behind the so-dubbed “Sodinokibi” ransomware have recently switched from Bitcoin (BTC) to Monero to better protect their identities from law enforcement.Earlier this month, major United Kingdom-based firm Travelex was forced to fork out almost $2.3 million in Bitcoin after being infected by Sodinokibi on new year’s eve 2020."

Today, the bank has revealed it will add XRP to this service next month.Arab Bank Switzerland is a Swiss institution that forms part of the Jordan-headquartered Arab Bank group. It was reportedly one of the first banks in Switzerland to offer digital assets services and has made known its conviction that the traditional and digital asset sectors are on track for ever-higher levels of convergence. Speaking to Cointelegraph, Rani Jabban, managing partner at Arab Bank Switzerland, said that the bank had been observing the digital asset market and blockchain sector since 2017. It took time to find a suitable infrastructure that would enable it to offer custody and trading services to its clients and finally sealed the partnership with Taurus in 2019. Jabban said the bank believes that Taurus’ solutions will help the industry to realize the opportunities that are offered by tokenizing traditional assets, as well as digital assets themselves.The bank more broadly believes that blockchain and smart contracts technologies will bring major efficiency gains for issuers, advisors, investors and institutions across the financial services industry. Alongside Arab Bank Switzerland, a number of strategic investors as well as existing, private investors took part in the Series A for Taurus, though its co-founders remain the majority stakeholders in the firm.The company plans to use the fresh investment to scale up its operations and expand its services to new financial centers in Europe, beginning with London, Paris and Frankfurt.As reported, crypto-specific banking institutions have already been established in Switzerland, including Seba Crypto AG and Sygnum, both of which have secured banking and securities dealer licenses from local regulators. Among the country’s legacy financial institutions, Swiss private bank Maerki Baumann revealed last year that it had experienced a major influx of 400 new clients wanting to tap its planned blockchain offerings after it revealed its interest in the sector."

However, the money may never reach its targets.","Intended to help families through the coronavirus crisis, the payments were not exempted from private debt collection, which means banks and other creditors could lawfully intercept the emergency payments. If ever there was evidence that cryptocurrencies were a safer way for people to receive funds, CARES Act payment interceptions and garnishments are surely proof.Twelve years after gleefully accepting a good chunk of the $440 billion disbursed through the TARP program in the wake of the global financial crisis they caused, legacy banks are again using a crisis to shore up their balance sheets.The payments cannot be intercepted by state or federal agencies to service debts, with the exception of child support payments in arrears. But Congress failed to extend that protection to private debt collection.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin became aware of the potential for banks to intercept payments a week after the legislation was written and two weeks after funds began to be issued. Despite the Treasury having the power to prevent the interception and members of the Senate urging Mnuchin in an open letter dated April 9 to enact those powers, nothing has been done to prevent banks from seizing payments.And indeed they have done just that.The United Services Automobile Association, or USAA, a bank that “proudly serve[s] military members and their families” took $3,400 in CARES Act payments from a disabled veteran to service past debts despite the family’s dire financial circumstances. According to the veteran’s wife, the bank told her over the phone that they “shouldn’t have gotten into debt in the first place.”According to a recent poll, just over half of Americans under the age of 45 have had work hours reduced. For those workers and their families, the coronavirus emergency relief money represents their only lifeline. Banks, however, stand in the way of that assistance.Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citibank and U.S. Bank were asked if they would use the money to service past debt. JPMorgan Chase committed not to seize monies for closed accounts that were in arrears. JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Bank of America agreed to pause repayments for at least 30 days.As Lauren Saunders from the National Consumer Law Center said: “At a time when people are desperate to buy food, the idea that anybody would grab [the $1,200 payments], let alone the banks they trust with their money, is appalling.”Meanwhile, it’s not only banks that can leap between people and their relief payments. Lisa Stifler from the Center for Responsible Lending said that “payday lenders in many states have access to bank accounts and can seize that money as well.”Since Bitcoin (BTC) was first created, there has been no need for a trusted third-party intermediary in a transaction between two parties. The imperative to pursue trustless transactions has never been greater — especially if the trusted intermediary cannot be trusted at all.Bank interceptions of emergency payments to families who suddenly, by no fault of their own, find themselves unemployed and unable to buy basic daily essentials is an act of grotesque cynicism and malfeasance.The concerns many governments have over crypto’s ability to destabilize their financial systems and reduce the number of levers they have to respond to crises, such as the one the world currently faces, are more appropriately laid at the feet of the legacy banking system.As the government tries to stave off a Great Depression-style meltdown that would be ruinous to millions of households, the banking system and predatory lenders are positioned to take advantage of those efforts. The risks they pose to the wider economy could be mitigated if a blockchain-based payment system were in place so that households had unmitigated access to their money.Cryptocurrency payments transferring directly into people’s self-custody wallets would not be at risk of seizure by an intermediary. The pandemic may yet be a tipping point, proving beyond doubt that trustless transactions are not only more efficient but help decision-makers and households alike navigate an economic disaster without the threat of banks taking deposits hostage.Little in terms of positivity may come from this global health crisis. But if it proves that the legacy financial infrastructure can interfere with a government’s efforts to minimize financial hardship by confiscating funds that belong to households when they need it most, the coronavirus pandemic may be the catalyst for a cryptocurrency awakening.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.Paul de Havilland is a fan of disruptive technology and an active investor in startups.

Cryptography",https://cointelegraph.com/news/algorands-releases-pointproofs-to-upgrade-fundamental-blockchain-cryptography,"Not just for Algorand. Merkle trees operate across many blockchains, 
including in Bitcoin (BTC) block headers. While Gorbunov explained that ...",,The Algorand (ALGO) project has developed a new cryptographic primitive called Pointproofs. The team believes they are a significant improvement to the Merkle proofs used in many blockchain systems.,"Cointelegraph spoke with Sergey Gorbunov, Algorand’s head of cryptography, to learn more about the paper that he and his team published on April 19.Smart contract blockchains like Algorand and Ethereum (ETH) rely on sharing a common state, which is the sum of all account balances and smart contract variables that define the blockchain.A major issue with this approach is that the state tends to get bloated over time, making the blockchain progressively harder to validate.In order to fix this, both Algorand and Ethereum are working to implement a “stateless” approach. Instead of storing the entire state, nodes would only compute the changes to the state from one block to the next, relying on cryptographic commitments to ensure that these changes are valid.This approach still requires nodes that hold the entire state, but they are no longer necessary for consensus. Gorbunov noted:“By decoupling who stores the state versus who can run the consensus, you are enabling more people to participate in the consensus itself.”The traditional way of using Merkle proofs adds significant overhead restrictions for each transaction. Gorbunov explained that each transaction needs 320 bytes of data for one proof. In a sample of 10,000 transactions, “that ends up being a 3.2 megabyte overhead, if you were to use Merkle trees,” explained Gorbunov.This poses major issues for a stateless blockchain. One of the tradeoffs of this approach is a significant increase in network bandwidth when propagating new blocks, an issue that could hinder its performance.This is where Pointproofs come in. They use pairing-based cryptography to allow the aggregation of multiple proofs. The benefits are significant, as he explained:“Every proof itself submitted by individual users is only 48 bytes. And then you can take these 10,000 proofs in a block of transactions and aggregate them again.”The result is just one 48 byte proof that can still be verified as entirely correct for all transactions.Merkle trees operate across many blockchains, including in Bitcoin (BTC) block headers. While Gorbunov explained that Bitcoin is unlikely to need Pointproofs due to having only one Merkle tree per block, he believes that Ethereum’s stateless client implementation may benefit from them.According to Gorbunov, Ethereum developers are considering a different solution named polynomial commitments, “which are not ideal,” he said. He argued that Pointproofs would be an improvement, urging Ethereum developers to consider including them."

that the upcoming Bitcoin (BTC) halving will only worsen the situation.",,The world’s largest cryptocurrency mining rig producer Bitmain released a statement on April 27 condemning deposed co-founder Micree Ketuan Zhan’s attempts to regain control over Fujian Zhanhua Intelligence Technology Co. Ltd.,"In an email on October 29, 2019, co-founder Jihan Wu disclosed that he was dismissing his Bitmain partner and chairman Micree Zhan. He also issued a strict warning to all Bitmain staff not to contact or attend meetings with Zhan.Following his dismissal, Zhan resorted to legal measures to regain his position at Bitmain. He has so far filed two complaints against Bitmain and its subsidiary Fujian Zhanhua Intelligence Technologies.“I will fight for her [Bitmain] till the end with legal weapons. I won’t allow those who want to plot against Bitmain to succeed. If someone wants a war, we will give them one.”Micree Zhan sued Fujian Zhanhua Intelligence Technologies claiming that he owned 36% of the company’s equity. However, Bitmain said in their latest statement addressing the case that Zhan had submitted no proof of the same, which makes his claims baseless in front of the law.The English translation of the statement also clarified:“The ruling reported by the media is only a procedural jurisdiction ruling, that is, the Fuzhou Intermediate People’s Court finally ruled that the case should be tried by the Fuzhou Changle District People ’s Court.”There has not been any hearing related to the case, let alone a final judgement, mentioned Bitmain.In a seemingly gentle effort to retain people’s trust in Bitmain, the company specifically mentioned that the results of the case will not have any impact on Bitmain’s production or operation. Fujian Zhanhua, too, will be under the absolute control of Bitmain, the statement assured.It is, however, interesting to note that Bitmain hasn’t been performing at its best since last year. On January 02, 2019, Cointelegraph reported that Bitmain was planning to cut 50% of its staff while dealing with other legal complications.At the moment, the fate of the largest mining company seems murky due to company politics and ongoing legal complications. It’s likely that the upcoming Bitcoin (BTC) halving will only worsen the situation."

... begin to experiment with demands in currencies other than bitcoin.”.",,A cybercrime group recently infected two plastic surgery studios with ransomware. They subsequently leaked patient’s social security numbers and other sensitive information onto the internet.,"Emsisoft threat analyst, Brett Callow, told Cointelegraph on May 5 that Maze recently took credit for hacking a plastic surgeon named Kristin Tarbet. They also claim to have hacked the Ashville Plastic Surgery Institute. He explained that in Tarbet’s case, the hackers have already leaked highly sensitive data:“The data that has been posted included names, addresses, social security numbers as well as what appears to be before and after photos and photos taken during surgical procedures. The Maze group typically start by posting only a small amount of the data that was exfiltrated — it’s the equivalent of a kidnapper sending a pinky finger — so they may well have more data than has already been published.”Callow explained that many ransomware incidents are caused by basic security failings. These include easy-to-crack credentials or unpatched remote access systems. He said that organizations should focus more on cybersecurity since “Maze uses a combination of strategies in order to gain access to networks including [Remote Desktop Protocol] exploitation, phishing, and spear-phishing.”When it comes to the ransom requested by the hackers, he said that it cannot be known, but past attacks could serve as a guide:“Only the criminals and the plastic surgeon will know the amount of the demand. In a previous case, Maze claimed their demand was $2 million: $1 million to decrypt the victim’s data and an additional $1 million to destroy the copy of it.”When it comes to the Ashville Plastic Surgery Institute, the published data includes patient names, dates of birth, insurance details, patients’ implant order forms, before and after photos, and internal documents like income statements. Callow explained:“This data dump is simply an initial warning shot. Should the company not pay, more data may be published.”Callow said that this is not the first time the group has attacked two targets in the same industry. He explained that Maze’s victims often reside in the same geographic location or operate in the same industry. Maze claimed that there is a reason behind those instances in a statement:“We don’t need to use phishing attacks and slowly move from one target to another as we have the access to the hosting provider.”In recent months, Ransomware groups have started threatening to leak victim’s sensitive information if they are not paid. There was a time when ransomware groups would only render user data inaccessible and ask for the ransom for restoring access to it. As Cointelegraph reported in late April, a cybercrime group has published personal and financial data from the Californian City of Torrance and threatened to release 200 gigabytes more after the city’s officials denied that any data was stolen.In mid-April, the first major ransomware group — REvil — also announced that it intends to switch from Bitcoin (BTC) to privacy-centric altcoin Monero (XMR). At the time Callow said:“Like other businesses, criminal enterprises adopt strategies that have been proven to work and, accordingly, if this switch proves successful for REvil, we’d expect to see other groups begin to experiment with demands in currencies other than bitcoin.”"

The network is also growing more popular, with the number of active wallets more than doubling since January to around half a million.","The developers behind the second-largest DeFi protocol, Synthetix, have partnered with Ethereum layer-2 research team Optimism to launch a demo deployment of Synthetix Exchange on the Optimistic Virtual Machine (OVM).Optimism’s OVM is a layer-2 scaling solution designed to allow DeFi financial platforms to operate with comparable speeds to centralized systems.The use of scaling technology has reportedly seen significant gains in performance — including a reduction in oracle update latency of 37.5 times, a drop in transaction delay of 75 times, and significant contractions in gas prices for oracle and exchanges related transactions.Foreshadowing the move earlier in the year, founder Kain Warwick told Cointelegraph that the existing Ethereum network still had a lot of life left in it.“Even if ETH 2.0 was to not happen, there’s still a lot of upside in ETH 1,” he said, adding the Optimism scaling solution makes a couple of thousand transactions per second achievable. That’s an order of magnitude greater than the handful of transactions per second that was possible until now on Ethereum or Bitcoin. “There’s the potential for ETH to scale up significantly without moving to Proof of Stake,” he said.On May 4, Biconomy launched the beta mainnet for their relayer infrastructure.The platform is designed to facilitate gas-free interactions with DApp protocols, removing technical barriers to greater adoption and making it easier for DApp developers to onboard and manage users. While it’s of most help to Ethereum developers right now, it’s actually blockchain agnostic.DApps that integrate Biconomy will be able to access the applications through a familiar username and password interface — removing the need for technical interaction with smart contracts or gas fees.In a May 6 blog post, Biconomy asserts that its research has pointed to gas optimization, relayer development, and clunky user-experiences among the major pain points stifling innovation.The post announced Biconomy’s 10 launch partners — Matic Network, Torus, Daostack, Sapien Network, Dapp Pocket, Zefi, Alathea, Frontier Wallet, Fortmatic, and Idle Finance — signaling strong demand for the protocol’s promise of improved customer and developer experiences.Amid the increasing popularity of DeFi and the highly anticipated roll-out of ETH 2.0, the number of active users has doubled since January — recently bumping up against 500,000 for the first time since June 2019.The creation of unique ETH addresses has also accelerated in recent weeks, with the number of daily new wallets jumping from between 50,000 and 100,000 during the early months of 2020 to over 100,000 throughout March.

(USDC), or Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) into a Maker smart contract.",,Crypto analysts AlfaBlok has published a report that claims the number of circulating Dai will need to increase by more than 70% each year in order for MakerDAO (MKR) to maintain its current capitalization of close to $350 million.,"According to AlfaBlok’s modelling, published May 5, the supply of Dai will need to exceed several trillion by 2040 — up from the current supply of roughly 100 million.The analysts said they had conducted “a fundamental analysis on this decentralized business based on discounted earning flows” and concluded:“The bottom line is that the current valuation implies very aggressive growth rates, of over 70%+ Dai circulation increase per year reaching trillions of Dai in circulation, in order for current valuation to make sense.”AlfaBlock said that this is possible, but challenging:“Demand for Dai has clearly been there so far. So much so, that it’s been difficult to keep the peg close to $1. The big challenge remains to increase in supply in a structural way that allows it to reach hundreds of billions of Dai in circulation over the next decades.”In order to achieve a circulating supply that large AlfaBlok speculates that real estate, presumably tokenized, may need to become an accepted form of collateral.“There is over $170T worth of real estate in the world today, and so this should be mechanically feasible,” the report states.Alternatively, the report discusses the possibility of the protocol breaking its peg and operating with under-collateralization.MakerDAO is the decentralized finance protocol that generates the Dai (DAI) stablecoin. DAI are created when a user deposits Ethereum (ETH), Basic Attention Token (BAT), USD Coin, (USDC), or Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) into a Maker smart contract. The deposited funds are entered into a collateralized debt position called a ‘vault,’ with a sum of DAI equal to that of the deposited crypto assets minus a maintenance margin being created. Users are then able to earn interest or lend funds from their Vault.The collateralized crypto can only be accessed after the corresponding Dai are repaid and destroyed, and can be auctioned off to recapitalize the Maker system should its value fall below that of the outstanding loan.AlfaBlock concluded the report by saying that Maker was breaking new ground for DeFi projects:“MakerDAO is a very important project for DeFi - not only is it a critical Lego piece, it also is a model for how DeFi DAO-based orgs can operate. We’re all going to learn much from how this will all unfold.”"

However, he said for the digital yuan to replace cash or other current payment solutions, four key conditions needed to be met: “Whether the digital Yuan can become the dominant form of currency and mainstream payment means, depends on whether it has greater efficiency, lower transaction costs, enough economic scale with commercial value, and people’ acceptance.”Li believes if a currency uses digital technology, it can be called digital currency.

However, he added that limits would be placed on the frequency and amounts involved in anonymous transactions. As Cointelegraph reported previously, the Bank of China has carried out pilot testing on the CBDC in different sites and it believes it will not cause inflation."
174,https://cointelegraph.com,,The DeFi Hack: What Decentralized Finance Should and Shouldn’t Be,https://cointelegraph.com/news/the-defi-hack-what-decentralized-finance-should-and-shouldnt-be,"Back on April 18, $25 million in Ether and Bitcoin (BTC) was stolen from 
users of the lending protocol Lendf.me. Lendf is a protocol with 
security ...",,"Decentralized finance, or DeFi for short, became a buzzword in 2019 following the valuations of MakerDao and Compound after both companies raised sizable rounds from the elite Silicon Valley-based Venture Capital firm Andreessen Horowitz.","2020 has been a difficult year for the crypto DeFi sector — it’s been going through the wringer. Over the weekend, the dForce ecosystem protocol Lendf.me lost 99.95% of its funds from a hacking exploit. Just days later, the hacker leaked information about his identity that resulted in him returning most of the stolen funds. This news comes following DeFi’s greatest test on March 12, when the Ether (ETH) price sharply fell, causing systems to become overly stressed and fail. The big loser that day was MakerDao, whose poor architecture and infrastructure was exposed due to the limitations of the Ethereum network.The leading decentralized finance platform MakerDao accrued debt that had to be bailed out by its venture capital firm’s money. A month later, DAI’s dollar peg was experiencing stability issues and a $28.3 million class-action lawsuit was filed against the Maker Foundation in the Northern District Court of California for negligence. Users want their money back.Back on April 18, $25 million in Ether and Bitcoin (BTC) was stolen from users of the lending protocol Lendf.me. Lendf is a protocol with security issues and is part of the dForce Foundation’s ecosystem. Surprisingly, it was actually able to collect almost all funds back from the attacker who exploited the reentry loophole in its protocol, as he eventually returned almost all of the money he had stolen. After draining $25 million, the hacker returned $24 million of it, keeping $1 million for himself for… you know, gas fees and these difficult COVID-19 times, maybe.Ironically, the hacker didn’t return the same mix of assets that was stolen, instead returning the $24 million in a different combination of cryptocurrency tokens. This comes immediately following the news that the dForce Foundation closed a $1.5 million round led by Multicoin Capital, with participation from Huobi Capital and CMB International last week. We can assume these funds are going to cover the losses from the hack.I spoke with two DeFi CEOs of Compound Finance and Kava Labs to ask them about their experience with dForce and what key takeaways the hack can teach the DeFi community.Brian Kerr, the CEO of DeFi lending platform Kava Labs, spoke to Cointelegraph about what went wrong with dForce that allowed this hack to transpire. In mid-2019, Kava announced its stablecoin USDX. Shortly after, dForce released its own stablecoin ticker name as USDx. The use of Kava’s USDX ticker displays the limited creativity at dForce, which is likely extended to its code and technical talent as well. Robert Leshner, CEO of DeFi lending company Compound Finance, personally spoke with Cointelegraph in an interview, following his tweet about the $25 million hack and claiming that the company stole code that is recognizable as Compound’s.During the phone interview with Cointelegraph, Leshner explained:“Building on-chain is merciless; security requires a team’s full attention. When teams redeploy code they haven’t written, it makes it impossible to know how, or why, the code works, or what the risks are… anything less is an injustice to users. And users should demand better.” Sadly, dForce has become an example of what DeFi shouldn’t be.In the case of both MakerDao and dForce, what started as a disaster is now in the process of being resolved. Though a significant sum of the funds are still unaccounted for, the experience has left users seeking alternative DeFi lending platforms that they can actually trust. Many users have lost funds, and many others feel wary simply from reading DeFi news these days, even if their money hasn’t been compromised by either MakerDao or dForce. As a subfield within the crypto space, DeFi is still very young.Leshner said that the dForce firm “copy/pasted Compound v1 without changes.” According to Leshner, the company alleges that the Compound v1 code “was not flawed,” but that the group was cautious about the asset it listed, according to his tweets. The dForce team copied code it did not fully understand from Compound and illegally deployed it as its own while changing a few parts without realizing the security issues involved, according to Leshner.Also weighing in was Kerr. Kava Labs — a DeFi lending platform similar to MakerDao, but while MakerDao only accepts ETH tokens, the Kava platform accepts any asset including Bitcoin, Ripple (XRP), Binance Coin (BNB) and Cosmos (ATOM), which can be used to mint USDX, the platform’s stablecoin. These milestones of the platform’s development came prior to dForce knocking off the ticker name USDX for their own stablecoin. Kerr shared that Kava aims for USDX to become a major player in the global financial system.Based on Kerr’s account to Cointelegraph and stated in his reply to Leshner on Twitter, dForce heavily marketed Lendf.me to the world without first running very basic audits: “A basic audit from any reputable firm would have caught this — reentrancy is a known issue and easily checked for. Outside of stealing Compound’s code, DForce also stole Kava’s USDX token name and ticker — despite us announcing our token many months before they even had a platform.” Kerr admitted, “It’s a terrible example of what DeFi should not be.”As trust is the most central and important foundation for a relationship between a person and their money, Kerr believes the responsibility was with “both the dForce team and the application’s users.” He continued: “dForce didn’t understand what they were doing and marketed an unsafe product. The users didn’t do their own due diligence on the team or the codebase to determine if the product is safe for use.” As previously reported by Cointelegraph, dForce’s hacker used the imBTC token as a “trojan horse” of the attack — as an Ethereum wrapper for Bitcoin. Leshner explained that the security error came from a known reentrancy attack: “This is a followup attack to the imBTC Uniswap attack yesterday.” He went on to say, “imBTC is an ERC-777 token and not a normal Ethereum asset. Smart contracts that include imBTC have to be extra cautious and write additional code to protect against reentrancy attacks.”This is considered to be a well-known vulnerability of the common ERC-20 standard, especially when used in the DeFi context.The Ethereum network’s architecture doesn’t meet the scaling and security needs of the DeFi sector, as the level of testing required to achieve all outcomes is infinite in the Solidity programming language, according to Kerr. “For these reasons and many others, leading projects including Binance, Cosmos, and Kava have chosen to leave the Ethereum ecosystem for greener pastures,” he said.“Building any financial service on the Ethereum Network is problematic for security. Testing the possible outcomes and bugs of Solidity is near impossible as it can do virtually anything as a Turing Complete Language. While powerful, it’s probably the worst environment to build financial infrastructure,” stated Kerr, who sees one of Kava’s value propositions is that it is rooted in security standards as a purpose-built platform for all assets requiring safe DeFi services as a top priority.Lendf calls itself, “By far the largest fiat-backed stablecoin DeFi lending protocol.” What’s problematic is that Lendf was too focused on raising capital, growth and expansion to maintain its biggest, best and “largest fiat backed stablecoin” claim to fame. Instead of focusing on improving code for security, understanding its codebase, fixing bugs and releasing secure products, the firm was overly focused on profit and perceived status.Basic audits, for example, were missing completely and hurdles were being jumped too quickly by the team, resulting in a security vulnerability that is yet to be resolved.The event could have been prevented and users should have seen this coming, according to Leshner, who tweeted details about how the company had stolen Compound’s code: “If a project doesn’t have the expertise to develop its own smart contracts, and instead steals and redeploys somebody else’s copyrighted code, it’s a sign that they don’t have the capacity or intention to consider security.” He later encouraged developers and users to learn a valuable lesson: Don’t give your money to a company you can’t trust.Kava Labs’ Kerr proceeded to quote Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s motto of “move fast and break things,” elaborating: “It’s a great saying to live by for basic software and start-ups, but definitely the worst advice when building financial infrastructure as this past weekend has shown.”Kerr also shared, “At Kava, all our code is built from the ground up, in Golang, in very discreet modules that are scoped to very specific actions that we can audit and verify. This means that we can fully test the code to a very high confidence for its accuracy and security.” He continued:“We value the safety of user funds and put it at the forefront of everything we do. We run testnets, conduct 3rd party audits, and have a substantial peer review prior to any code going live on the Kava platform. Furthermore, all new code must be reviewed and voted for by the validator group securing and staking $KAVA which includes technically savvy operators like Binance, OKEx, Huobi, Bitmax, Hashkey, Lemniscap, SNZ, Dokia Capital and Framework Ventures.”It’s not enough to trust a company because they have big-name investors, as we have seen is the case with dForce and MakerDao. However, we often hear “trust and verify” when we should probably hear “verify and trust” from the DeFi community.While Leshner is the CEO of Compound, he’s also a personal investor for Kava Labs along with other top backers like Arrington XRP Capital. Kava’s excellent technical team and strict adherence to security measures is what has auditors talking about their code. Prior to Kava Labs’ launch, the lending platform ran a professional audit by CertiK — the leading formal verification and audit firm. In a blogpost on the audit’s results, CertiK stated, “Kava is one of the best codebases Certik has seen from a project to date, especially in the Decentralized Finance sector.”Finally, Kerr took the high ground in concluding, “I highly encourage anyone thinking of using a DeFi protocol to first check the team for technical competence, check for technically diligent investors, and check that audits and peer reviews have been done. Even then, assume there will always be some technical risk and market risk when it comes to DeFi protocols. It’s a young space and there will be more painful learnings like this to come.”The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.Andrew Rossow is a millennial attorney, law professor, entrepreneur, writer and speaker on privacy, cybersecurity, AI, AR/VR, blockchain and digital currencies.

This part of the code validates blocks before adding them to the chain.While Burkett was still unsure as to which specific area to tackle next, he did state that his high-level plan involved continued codebase integration and “lots more testing.”Burkett also gave an update on his other project, Grin++, which has just achieved release candidate v1.0.0 status, marking its “first non-beta version.” Grin++ featured the first implementation of the Mimblewimble privacy protocol, back in January 2019.Mimblewimble was first revealed in 2016 when its white paper — authored by an individual acting under the pen name Tom Elvis Jedusor — appeared on a Bitcoin research channel.The protocol aims to improve blockchain privacy, scalability, and fungibility by combining transactions in a CoinJoin. As a result, blocks on the network comprise a list of all input, output, and signature data, which obscure transaction data for any third party monitoring the network."

To be successful, all parties must attack simultaneously, however, they are aware of a traitor among them — making it difficult for the forces to act in unison.In the context of a blockchain, the metaphor refers to the challenge for a network in seeking to coordinate amid the threat of malicious actors seeking to cause disruptions by transmitting false or inaccurate data.Bitcoin (BTC) achieves Byzantine fault tolerance through its proof-of-work mining algorithm — which necessitates enormous resource investment in order to briefly exert a small influence on the network.The paper outlines the use of Twins to recreate several noted attacks on BFT protocols, determining that two of the attacks — both of which “took the community more than a decade to discover” — would have been identified by Twins “within minutes.”Calibra co-creator and board member, David Marcus, tweeted:“One of my greatest joys at work is getting to work with some of the brightest and most capable people in the industry. Here's some cutting edge work on testing BFT implementations by our mighty research team.”While the paper asserts that many Byzantine seniors can be identified using the system, the authors concede that “some Byzantine behaviors are not covered by Twins,” including those that do not adhere to the full disclosure of causal past — where nodes act deterministically according to previous behavior."
178,https://cointelegraph.com,,Decentralized Web Protocol IPFS Has Its Biggest Update So Far,https://cointelegraph.com/news/decentralized-web-protocol-ipfs-has-its-biggest-update-so-far,"Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz argued in March that Web 3.0 — and not 
just Bitcoin (BTC) — will change the world. As Cointelegraph ...",,Decentralized file- and web-hosting protocol InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) announced its largest upgrade so far.,"According to an announcement shared with Cointelegraph, the developers will release IPFS version 0.5. on April 28. IPFS 0.5 reportedly makes uploading new data two times faster, fetching content two to five times faster, while finding nodes that have it will be two to six times quicker after the network performs the upgrade.IPFS uses a distributed hash table (DHT) to index its files and allow their navigation. In IPFS 0.5 the DHT implementation was overhauled with improved logic, which resulted in a more efficient system:“This has made searching faster and more efficient — meaning significantly fewer dials, faster queries, and less bandwidth for the network as a whole.”IPFS project lead Molly Mackinlay told Cointelegraph that finding and fetching content faster “will significantly improve the user experience of all apps and websites built on IPFS.” Mackinlay believes that this update is particularly important for decentralized applications that require fast updates, content routing, and data transfers.  Furthermore, she explained that faster announcing and adding times will decrease the system resources needed to run IPFS, which will make service operations cheaper for developers. She continued:“There's also a ton of smaller features - like support for .eth domains, tools for fast data importing and exporting, and developer tooling improvements. [...] Apps like social networks, distributed video players, and package managers will see big improvements from IPFS 0.5 as they're able to find and fetch data faster.”Lastly, Mackinlay also pointed out that there’s still much space for improvement for protocol development. She explained:“We're actually only half-way through our H1 focus on content routing improvements - and we think we can definitely shave off another 2x, likely much more, in our upcoming 0.6 and 0.7 releases later this quarter. There's a lot of other areas that could use more help and attention, so anyone with some free cycles should take a look at the help-wanted issues or our open bounties to get a sense of what features, documentation, or tooling would be most useful.”Web 3.0 is an umbrella term for technologies which according to some will power the future version of the web. Many in the cryptocurrency community believe that this future version of the web will be decentralized instead of relying on hosting data — such as websites — on centralized servers.Hosting data on big, centralized servers creates a centralized point of failure that, in the case of a hack, could result in the loss of massive amounts of sensitive personal information. Furthermore, those servers are managed by firms that often sell data to third parties — sometimes with catastrophic consequences, as the Cambridge Analytica scandal showed.IPFS aims to provide a decentralized alternative to server-based hosting which the developers say is resilient, upgradable, more open, and safer. In the long run, the developers hope the initiative will also make the web faster.Mackinlay pointed out that mainstream web browser Opera, crypto-enabled web browser Brave, the Ethereum Name Service and major web service Cloudflare all already support the IPFS protocol.Web 3.0 development is a major area of focus for cryptocurrency and blockchain firms. The reason for this is the great theoretical potential of such initiatives. Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz argued in March that Web 3.0 — and not just Bitcoin (BTC) — will change the world. As Cointelegraph reported at the end of 2019, many also believe that Web 3.0 will drive worldwide cryptocurrency adoption."

Lmfao But seriously, I'm Super Excited for T.I. and FLiK They're gonna crush it! #ICO #blockchain #crypto #bitcoin.”On March 3, 2020, T.I. was dismissed of all securities fraud charges relating to the ICO, with U.S. District Judge Charles Pannell ruling that the plaintiffs had failed to find concrete evidence of securities violations.“The plaintiffs have merely alleged that [T.I.] encouraged his Twitter followers to visit the website for the FLiK ICO,” said Judge Pannell. “They have not provided any statements from Harris about the value of the FLiK tokens.”In his request for early judgment earlier this month, Hart argued that the fraud allegations laid against him were “threadbare” and exhibit less merit than the now-dismissed claims against T.I."

swaps ...",,Hybrix releases their white paper for a layer 2 protocol that could make centralized exchanges all but obsolete.,"Amsterdam, NL (May, 2020): Today, hybrix, a young Dutch startup based in Amsterdam, released their white paper: A Peer-to-Peer Token Protocol Across Multiple Ledger Systems.Since its genesis, hybrix championed the notion of private ownership of one’s asset and freedom of transactions without third parties - the very foundations of Bitcoin as a peer-to-peer payment system. hybrix takes it a step further, creating a meta-ledger that can allow asset swaps between multiple blockchains.The team behind hybrix already had some major successes. In 2014, they crowdfunded Internet of Coins project (no ‘the’). They also released a series of open-source tools for crypto developers and adopters, including a decentralized wallet (2017), a multi-block explorer (2019), and a powerful API and library. Their solutions won multiple awards (NLNet, ISOC) and research grants (SIDN).Today, the group is releasing its newest white paper detailing hybrix meta-layer protocol. It leverages the underlying ledger’s infrastructure and governance to enable secure value swaps between blockchains through zero-value transactions. Also this month, they will list their first cross-ledger, multi-chain token, the hy token, which will enable direct asset swaps and incentivize the new network of Validators of the meta-layer, through Validation as a Service (VAAS) So far, the hybrix platform supports 31 different blockchains and 347 tokens, and as the founders explain, anyone can add more tokens using the hybrix open-source framework. Developers and projects can also launch their own cross-ledger tokens. The barriers of entry are purposely low; The underlying ledgers need only to be immutable and public with verifiable transactions that have a unique ID, source and target addresses, and an attachment field for data storage such as the op_return. That’s where the metadata goes. Another strong side of hybrix is their attention to user design and intuitive implementation.“The hard part lies in making something a polished product. The first 80% is quickly made, but the hard part is finishing the final 20%.” writes the hybrix cofounder, Joachim de Koning, in a medium post about their multi-block explorer, which his team built in only three weeks. It was a test for the hybrix back-end. Now, this simple web-based tool (image) enables anyone to check any public blockchain transaction history in seconds.Multi-chain transaction history browser powered by hybrix.From front-end simplicity to an intuitive back-end, the group makes it a priority to leave only the essential functions and test everything. All this effort is to entice the users and help developers of all levels join and start building. Developers not specializing in blockchain need to be able to keep track, which is why the team developed modular, intuitive, and lightweight stack, the founders told Blockrock.“Currently (blockchain technology) is still too difficult to understand. It should be much closer to the common person, much closer to the common developers” reiterates Joachim de Koning. The cofounder of hybrix, was an early Litecoin miner and a blockchain developer. He remembers the times when it was easy to store tokens on one’s hard drive. The subsequent boom in cryptocurrencies and tokens made it difficult to store, manage, and exchange value without the help of centralized custodians like crypto exchanges. Since those early days, Joachim was devising solutions to simplify token management and asset transfer while upholding values introduced by the original Bitcoin white paper, the principles of determinism and decentralization. The newly launched hybrix token protocol is the perfect addition to atomic swaps and decentralized exchanges, and could one day do away with centralized third party alternatives altogether.Luckily for crypto exchanges, hybrix is not focused on getting them out of business just yet. Founder’s key mission is to increase the adoption of DLT through interoperability and helping developers build within the multi-platform ecosystem where they can easily switch between different ledgers and implementations.Betting on superb user experience, hybrix aims to increase the public adoption of cryptocurrencies without sacrificing freedom of transactions.Read the white paper here (hybrix: A Peer-to-Peer Token Protocol Across Multiple Ledger Systems).Hybrix is a multi-blockchain platform that leverages the strengths of every individual blockchain; Creating Freedom of Transaction by letting value flow freely across all different ledgers with the first cross-ledger token."

theory to the test, concluding that “it is still too early to foretell the 
role ...",,"CoinMarketCap, which recently became a Binance company, released a report on Q1 crypto market performance, as seen from its perspective. One of the more interesting details is the significant decrease in users from China. ","As revealed by the report, published on April 30, China fell from 13th to 24th position in the country rankings by page views. A less dramatic but sizable decrease was also seen from South Korean users, who fell by 3 positions to the 19th place.Furthermore, CoinMarketCap noted that the decrease largely occurred in the period between Jan 14 and 25, after which its ranking remained stagnant.The report connects this to the Coronavirus pandemic and resulting country-wide lockdowns, with the events largely unfolding in that period, culminating in the Jan. 23 lockdown of Hubei, the epicenter of the disease.The report speculated that part of the reasons may be due to increased censorship from the Great Firewall.The explanation behind this decrease is not immediately apparent, as forcing people to stay at home would naturally result in increased usage of the internet. However, the effect of economic uncertainty from the lockdowns would act in the opposite direction, discouraging traders from participating in high-risk activities.Amey Wang, chief editor at Cointelegraph China, believes that Coinmarketcap’s hypotheses are valid. “Because of the coronavirus, the firewall is more serious than before,” she said. Many VPN services suffered outages in China as the country’s officials sought to restrict outside access.But she also said to have observed people having “more time to speculate in the cryptocurrency market because of the coronavirus.”It is difficult to access statistics about trading volume in China, due to the fact that cryptocurrencies are officially banned. Exchanges like Huobi and OKEx, while incorporated outside of China, are nevertheless mostly used by Chinese traders. According to data from Similarweb, both Huobi and OKEx saw decreases in their share of Chinese users from February to March. Data for January is not available, but their overall traffic figures were in fact growing throughout January and February.Similarweb data from Gate.io, which also sees a lot of traffic from China, shows a similar decrease in traffic share from February. A deep trough in traffic from December to January could support CoinMarketCap findings, but this dip is also partially seen in Western-centric exchanges like Coinbase.It appears reasonable that crypto trading activity slowed down in China during the lockdown, but CoinMarketCap’s figures could also have a different explanation.CoinMarketCap saw significant growth in the number of female users, averaging +48% since Q4 2019. In terms of age, two polar opposite categories saw the most growth: the 18-24 bracket and 65+ group, with +46% and +41% growth, respectively.The report also analyzed the price performance of crypto assets, which had a highly volatile period. It noted that some assets managed to post positive growth over the entire period, despite the March 12 crash.The company also noted that the pandemic put Bitcoin’s safe haven asset theory to the test, concluding that “it is still too early to foretell the role and fate of crypto.”"

In total, the jump from February’s 2,430 fully private transactions to the 8,721 in April represents an increase of over 250%.In contrast, it took three years for fully shielded transactions to break through the 2,000 per-month level, which only happened in November last year.While 6% of the total transactions may not seem like an awful lot, this only includes those which were fully shielded. When considering all transactions with some shielded component, this goes up to 23,676, or 15% of the total.Zcash supports two types of address: z-addr, which are shielded, and t-addr, which are transparent. Transactions between t-addr types are fully transparent, and can be viewed on the blockchain in the same way as Bitcoin (BTC) transactions.Transactions between two z-addresses are fully shielded, and transactions between the two address types can be either shielding (t to z) or deshielding (z to t). It is worth noting that all of these three transaction types with a shielded component add to the privacy of the network.Cointelegraph reached out to Zcash developer Electric Coin Company to see if it had any insight into the latest jump in figures, but had not received a response at press time.However, it has recently become a lot easier for Zcash users to use shielded transactions. In early April, Guarda released its wallet app for Shielded ZEC. This now joins Zecwallet Lite, which was launched last November, and defaults to sending private transactions by shielding any transparent ZEC sent to it.Zcash was also added as a perpetual contract option on Binance’s futures platform in February. This coincides with the point at which shielded transaction numbers started to go up dramatically."

This news comes despite the COVID-19 outbreak and recent rumours about in-house problems, a recent report suggests.","According to the industry blog, Wu Said Blockchain, Bitmain announced internally that the company had earned over $300 million so far this year. Further, the mining giant reportedly regained some market share as it opened four new mining facilities and saw the hashrate increase on two of its mining pools.Notably, the report mentioned that Bitmain’s Artificial Intelligence, or AI, business has also grown rapidly. The company entered the sector in 2018, planning to use its ready-made chip designs to power AI systems and software.After a January report suggesting massive staff layoffs, the firm is now said to be rewarding its employees with individual bonuses of up to 70,000 yuan (about $9,900) on the Labor Day, which is scheduled for May 1. The bonus payments will amount to “millions of yuan”, as per the report.The new report might come as a surprise, given that Bitmain is considered one of the biggest victims of the “crypto winter”, and the upcoming Bitcoin halving is also expected to hinder mining profits. Along with the above mentioned job cuts, Bitmain experienced a noticeable market share decline in the second half of 2019. The pandemic has also reportedly undermined the mining industry in China, although a Bitmain representative has previously told Cointelegraph that it prompted the company to explore alternate methods of working.More recent problems for Bitmain include reports suggesting that its mining rig, Bitmain S17/T17 Antminer, has a high failure rate. There is also a well documented legal fight between two of its co-founders, Jihan Wu and Micree Ketuan Zhan. In October 2019, Wu ousted Zhan, who was Bitmain’s partner and chairman at the time, from the company. Additionally, Wu warned employees to cease any interaction with the ex-senior executive, threatening to fire those who disobey.Since then, Zhan has filed two complaints against Bitmain and its AI subsidiary, Fujian Zhanhua Intelligence Technologies, attempting to regain his position as a shareholder.

other crypto for any transaction, since it is “a currency that is not

The term is generally understood as being when the person no longer owns the crypto, whether they have sold, swapped, or carried out any other business with it.Therefore, for both countries, people must pay taxes when they sell crypto.Due to the lack of official definition by the Argentine government towards crypto, there are also no guidelines on when Argentines can pay taxes on crypto.In the countries mentioned, local or foreign crypto exchanges are not the ones in charge of taxing on behalf of the client, since it is the responsibility of each taxpayer to declare their obligations to the local authorities.Cointelegraph Spanish detailed at the beginning of 2020 the legal status of cryptocurrencies in various countries in Latin America.In the case of Bolivia, for example, it is illegal to use Bitcoins or any other crypto for any transaction, since it is “a currency that is not issued and controlled by a government or authorized entity.”Ecuador is another country in the region that banned digital assets in mid-2014. However, the laws in Ecuador do not appear to be strictly enforced towards crypto, so there are still Ecuadorians who are actively trading with Bitcoins."

(BTC) requested by the hackers, the group has ransomed data in the ...",,"A group of hackers dubbed Maze claims to have compromised the infrastructure of Banco BCR, a Costa Rican state-owned bank, and is now threatening to leak millions of credit card numbers.","On April 30, Maze claimed that it has scoped out the bank in August 2019:“According to Financial Institutions Protocol this bank had to notify other institutions about the security breach case. But nothing was made. Servers and workstations were not blocked. Private data was not secured. Anyway the Bank decided to conceal information about the breach. Though the security personnel were able to analyze the attack logs and to see that the attackers have accessed the payment processing system. We have stopped the attack as the possible damage was too high.”Maze states that subsequently, in February 2020, they checked the systems and saw that nothing was done to fix the cybersecurity vulnerabilities. The hackers claim that because of this, they decided to steal the data from the bank, including transaction information and credit card data:“We have got over 11 milion credit card credentials. Over 4 millions of those credit cards are unique. [Of those cards,] 140,000 belong to US citizens.”The ransomware group announced on May 5 that it was going to leak the information without concealing card numbers. While in this particular instance there is no data on the amount of Bitcoin (BTC) requested by the hackers, the group has ransomed data in the past.Brett Callow, cybersecurity threat analyst at Emsisoft previously told Cointelegraph that hacker's claims should be viewed suspiciously:“Claims made by ransomware groups should be taken with a grain of salt. [...] The details that the criminals choose to release will be cherry-picked and only information that they want to be in the public domain — probably because they believe it will help their cause in some way. [...] The press should avoid portraying ransomware groups as being in any way Robin Hood-like or repeating claims that assist them.”As of press time, Banco BCR has not answered Cointelegraph's request for comment.As Cointelegraph reported in late April, a recent report showed a major drop in the number of ransomware attacks carried out during the pandemic on the United States public sector. Still, this is unlikely to be linked to the cybercriminals’ willingness to avoid damaging the public sector amid the distress already caused by the coronavirus.In fact, at the end of April, hackers reportedly compromised the largest health center in Pueblo County, Colorado with cryptocurrency ransomware. While the hospital’s official statements claim that it won’t affect patient care, workers allegedly said that the paper-based record-keeping methods to which they have resorted are cumbersome and could negatively impact services."

How",https://cointelegraph.com/news/many-blockchain-projects-are-uniquely-suited-to-covid-19-research-heres-how,"Unfortunately, the popular ASIC miners that are often used for Bitcoin and 
similar assets are too specifically designed toward cryptocurrency to ...",,,"As the world is still reeling from the effects of the coronavirus pandemic, people everywhere are doing what they can to support the effort to find vaccines and treatments. Not to be left out, blockchain projects everywhere have rallied together to supply computing power and money in a concerted effort to accelerate research.It shouldn’t be surprising to hear that researching treatments, tending to patients and supplying resources are all expensive work. With the added burden of a global pandemic that is threatening the economy, supply chains and the workforce, donating extra resources when possible has maybe never been more essential. It takes money to keep many of these systems operating, and unfortunately, even with government support, it often isn’t enough. Then there’s the fact that even with cutting edge computer systems, researchers can still only process so much information hour-by-hour. This is another valuable resource that can be passed along, as across the world, people’s personal computers, as well as those of many institutions, contain massive amounts of computational power waiting to be tapped into. Finally, there’s data. In order to know as much as possible about the behavior and spread of the virus, medical professionals and crisis responders need as much accurate data as they can get. Fortunately, we live in a world rife with data-capturing potential, and more projects are now working to discover how to utilize this data in ways that don’t pose a threat to user privacy.The thing about the blockchain world is that many different players in this realm are poised to donate one or all of these forms of support. That’s why we’re going to break down some of the biggest and best efforts currently in the decentralized asset industry to lend help to this global crisis. In addition to what we’ve collected here, know that new programs and funds are being created every week as a means to ease the pressure on the planet right now.It takes vast amounts of raw processing in order to run protein folding simulations that researchers use to look for vaccines and therapies. This is nothing new, and the team behind Folding@Home has been reaching out to computer users around the world for years to donate idle CPU and GPU power toward fighting serious debilitating disorders with no existing cure yet. Obviously, in the wake of recent events, much of their efforts are now focused on recovering from the coronavirus. Essentially, by using the distributed power from thousands or millions of computers online, researchers can run these complex simulations, which are necessary in order to identify which drugs could be effective against this new threat. It’s arduous work and part of the reason new vaccines can often take years to develop. However, the more computers that are involved in these simulations the faster they can be processed, and this should accelerate us toward effective treatments. In fact, since this crisis began, so many new computers have jumped online that it has been reported that Folding@Home is now effectively the world’s most powerful supercomputer!It shouldn’t come as a surprise that cryptocurrency miners, who usually employ multiple, high-end GPUs in order to secure their networks and make a profit, are also perfectly suited for helping on this front. While NVIDIA recently put out a call for gamers to begin turning their rigs toward the fight, GPU miners stand to help many times over, especially for the larger operations. The biggest firm to step up so far has been Ethereum mining firm CoreWeave, which has transferred the computing power of some 6,000 of its miners toward the Folding@Home project. At the time of the transfer, those miners were generating over $3,000 worth of Ether a day, so nobody can say this is a small gesture.Unfortunately, the popular ASIC miners that are often used for Bitcoin and similar assets are too specifically designed toward cryptocurrency to be used for folding research, which is unfortunate due to the sheer amount of computing power they can muster. It will take more than just cryptocurrency miners to help solve this problem, and now, many prominent projects have taken up the cause as well. To this end, the team behind Cardano has strongly encouraged those securing its network to turn their processing power toward the Folding@Home project, with many lead team members forging the way with their own systems. In addition, the Tezos community has put out a similar call but sweetened the pot by setting up a humble reward that goes to the community member who provides the most resources to pandemic research. The amount began at just 15 Tezos but has been growing with small donations from the community to further encourage people to shift their processing power during this unprecedented time.As mentioned earlier, data is another pillar in this fight. Having accurate and recent data is essential for all types of levels of response to the outbreak. Of course, whenever there is talk of data collection, privacy concerns emerge as well. We can look to the blockchain community for answers for both of these problems. Both the Algorand Foundation and Enigma Project have launched community tracking and contact tracing software that is powered by blockchain technology and works to maintain anonymity in terms of the users submitting data. Both are still very much in the works but seek to provide answers that are effective and ethical.As for monetary support, Ripple announced in March that it would be making $100,000 donations to two different emergency response funds. Similarly, Gitcoin, already a funding platform, has launched a fund-matching round in conjunction with the Ethereum 2.0 team that will match $250,000 in donations toward research projects.Speaking of big money, cryptocurrency exchanges often have large reserves of resources, impressive sway in the community, and they certainly haven’t been afraid to show solidarity. Going as far back as January, major companies like Binance and Huobi were already donating to the relief effort at a time when the virus was still largely centralized inside of China. As the threat grew, so did the response from the industry. In late March, Binance expanded its effort and began a $5-million campaign toward getting aid to the nations that have been hardest hit by this disease.In a similar vein, popular crypto exchange HitBTC has announced that it has begun a program that will provide support in the form of computing power for blockchain projects that are working toward aiding in the global effort. To this end, they have already partnered with CureCoin, which is itself a project that branched off of the Folding@Home initiative. Obviously, the CureCoin team has now turned much of its attention toward the pandemic.Furthermore, in late April, BitMEX revealed on its blog that they too would be setting up a “COVID-19 Response Fund,” which will be seeing $2.5 million funneled into four organizations that are working against the pandemic. Specifically, these are Gates Philanthropy Partners, Nuclear Threat Initiative - Biosecurity Program, OpenMined and Our World in Data. While most individuals lack the types of resources that have been outlined above, those who can are encouraged to simply follow what these industry leaders have done. One of the simplest ways to contribute is to support the Folding@Home project yourself. This isn’t actually the same as cryptocurrency mining where weaker systems might as well not join in. Even a modest laptop can be of help if it has unused GPU cycles to contribute. So, this is really an “every little bit counts” scenario. With any luck, nerds in the blockchain community could soon be leading the way in at least one venue of this effort. If you are a trader, consider donating some of your profits to one or more of the various research teams working on this crisis. Maybe you work in crypto-journalism? Then spread the latest and most accurate information available to your peers and followers. Even if you just are somewhat popular on social media, don’t be afraid to spread the word and links for many of the causes outlined above.Take care of yourself and loved ones first, maintain the levels of hygiene and distancing recommended by health officials, and simply try to stay calm. We’ve been hearing this a lot lately, but whether you’re a blockchain advocate or not, we really are all in this together.Disclaimer.

transactions without revealing each others' identities or needing ...",,"Western perception of precious African resources usually tends to focus on the diamond trade. However, amid an ongoing pandemic, gold usually surfaces as both one of the most in-demand and discussed assets in the world.","Historically known as a risk-off asset, meaning its price is decoupled from most financial markets, gold is a safe-haven asset sought by financial institutions and retail traders alike. While the COVID-19 fallout has sparked widespread losses across global markets, with the price of gold also falling, the precious metal usually weathers financial storms better than most assets. This is in tune with the 2008 financial crisis where there was an initial dash for United States dollars as businesses had to settle debts and margin calls, which precipitated the 2009 to 2012 gold bull run.During crises, gold is in high demand. And for African countries, historically that has presented problems as foreign entities seek to coerce and bully Africa for gold and other precious resources. With a systemic financial crisis looming, Africa may turn to technology to protect its resources.Most gold reserves around the world are hoarded under the control of major Group of Seven central banks and stored in military-grade secure institutions, such as Fort Knox in Kentucky. The U.S. leads all countries in gold reserves by a significant margin, and South Africa and Algeria are the only African nations to crack the top 30 countries by gold reserves globally.This comes even though the Witwatersrand mines in South Africa have accounted for more than 40% of the world’s total production of gold. In addition, Ghana and Sudan, which are not even in the top 50 countries by gold reserves, are actually among the top 15 largest producers of gold in the world.Clearly, something is amiss.Just like how foreign companies have plundered diamonds at a dire political and social cost to Africa, gold has been sequestered from the coffers of African countries atop some of the largest reserves on Earth.Vast gold deposits in Africa have been pilfered by foreign countries over many decades.African history is a wealth of intrigue into the gold market too. Mansa Musa, the 10th emperor of Mali, was a historically renowned figure who consolidated much of western Africa in the 14th century and is widely considered one of the richest rulers in history. Stories of his empire rife with opulence signal one of ancient Africa’s most flourishing periods. The price of gold in Cairo was said to have plummeted after Musa’s visit following generous handouts of the precious metal on his pilgrimage to Mecca.However, times are much different now. The extended colonization of Africa in the years following Mansa Musa set the stage for the extraction of Africa’s precious minerals by foreign governments and adventurers. Those colonial restraints are now removed, but a more underhanded pilfering of gold by the private sector of foreign countries continues. Local labor and mining equipment is leveraged to extract deposits and usher them covertly through illicit suppliers.Gold then departs from African shores to serve the deposit needs and bolster the treasuries of major Western countries, leaving Africa with arid reserves that contribute to the necessity for dollar-denominated national currencies. Throw in repeated headlines of billions of dollars in African gold smuggled out of the continent and it becomes evident that the African gold industry is facing a pressing issue: auditability.For many Africans, this is not a surprising development, but is one that may be stifled with the advent of emerging technology such as blockchain.And with rumors of a systemic financial breakdown in the West fueling a narrative of bulking up gold reserves, an idea that Russia has taken to heart, that auditability problem needs fixing. Enter blockchains.Decentralized blockchains have several critical advantages, but one of the most important is the audibility of cryptographic signatures at scale. Bitcoin (BTC) works because a global user set can verify and authenticate transactions without revealing each others’ identities or needing permission to join the network.At a high level, a blockchain is just a digital ledger that builds upon conventional accounting mechanisms with cryptography and no single clearinghouse. The result is varying degrees of transparency on the ledger, supreme audibility of the supply and validity of asset transfers on the network.This solves a significant problem for the African gold trade.According to a recent article by Reuters, the black market for gold in Africa largely consists of labor abuses of local villagers by foreign companies and shell companies of foreign governments. These firms extract the gold and move it out of the country, mostly into the United Arab Emirates and other gateway markets to Russia, China, Europe and the U.S.These businesses have no oversight, do not log mining production numbers and are not taxed. As many of them are operating illegally, companies working as fences for the stolen gold in offshore markets are under no obligation to reveal their trade mechanics.And while many of the early gold mining operations were “artisanal,” leveraging local villages, Ghana — now the largest gold producer in Africa — has seen the rise of illicit syndicates to mine gold. And Ghana’s government has indicated that its reported gold production is only a fraction of what is actually produced by syndicates and ends up in foreign markets.To state it bluntly, blockchains are not a panacea solution to African gold exploitation issues.However, blockchains provide a fundamental change in tools for governments to manage gold production and supply chains. For example, the convoluted nature of African gold mining, which encompasses legitimate industry players, state companies, illegal syndicates and covert exchanges in offshore jurisdictions, makes approaching the task of curating and querying the actual production and flow of assets more than challenging.But in many instances, countries like Ghana can learn from South Africa, which has been leading the gold trade for decades with its vast reserves.Paired with government crackdowns on illegal syndicates, and maybe working in conjunction with legitimate industry mining firms, Ghana can reduce the amount of gold smuggled out of the country by laying down stricter enforcements. That’s a tall order, but if successful, blockchains could legitimize the entire effort.For example, under a new, cleaner and regulated gold mining industry in Ghana, gold extracted by firms could be tagged with near-field communication or radio-frequency identification tags, uploaded to the blockchain and cross-referenced with records of exports out of the country. Many blockchain-based supply chain projects are already using similar mechanisms.Once on the blockchain, gold movements can be validated, tracked and identified in real time, drastically hindering the ability to smuggle gold mined by legitimate companies out of the country. Whether foreign companies admit that they were doing that or not in the first place is another question entirely, something which Reuters pointed to as murky waters.An intriguing caveat of the entire opportunity also rests on the ongoing COVID-19 crisis.A massive liquidity crunch following outsized market losses and deleveraging by major passive funds, hedge funds, foreign institutions and corporations is driving a global dash for cash — the U.S. dollar. The Federal Reserve responded to surging dollar demand by flooding the economy with trillions in dollars via a federal funds interest rate of zero percent, standing repurchase agreement operations thrusting into the trillions, G-7 central bank swap lines and quantitative easing — a veritable monetary policy “bazooka.”In its attempt to mitigate a potential deflationary outcome where too few U.S. dollars chase a surplus of goods, the Fed may have induced a long-term cost-push inflation dilemma. The problem is only exacerbated by the notion that G-7 and Fed central banking systems have smaller gold deposits than necessary to cover the liabilities on the Fed’s balance sheet, which only continues to balloon with more monetary injections.Without a bedrock of hard money such as gold, which has traditionally served as a store of value, the dangerous dance of debt and inflation will reach tenuous levels. The resulting swing surge in gold demand or Bitcoin may strike a chord in many public investors, who will pile into assets not subject to the caprices of central banking monetary policy as the prices of goods rise and dollar demand wanes.The expansion of gold fever will result, kickstarting new mining operations. Entities ranging from governments to corporations will be looking to jump on the hard money bandwagon. Africa subsequently will become a hub of gold focus, which is precisely why auditability and African entrenchment of the supply chain is an obligation amid global economic uncertainty.Diamonds get the most attention, but as gold demand rises amid financial and economic uncertainty, Africa can protect one of its most sought after minerals by fusing technology with stronger government regulation in the sector.Billions in gold bullion won’t stealthily exit the continent, and the assets can help bolster developing African economies rather than relying on U.S. dollar currency pegs and foreign investments for growth. That’s a promising future for the continent as a whole and an opportunity that COVID-19’s fallout may have spotlighted.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.Chris Cleverly, a barrister by profession, has made it his mission to help bring development mechanisms to Africa which can empower Africans to seize their own destiny.

193,https://cointelegraph.com,,UAE’s DLT Overhaul on Track to Bring Blockchain to Daily Life by 2021,https://cointelegraph.com/news/uaes-dlt-overhaul-on-track-to-bring-blockchain-to-daily-life-by-2021,"... such as Japan, “have taken a proactive legislative approach, developing 
a framework whereby Bitcoin and potentially other crypto or virtual ...",,The United Arab Emirates is approaching its 2021 deadline for migrating at least 50% of all government transactions onto distributed ledger technology-based platforms.,"Cointelegraph spoke to Leon Smith, the CEO of Dex — an Abu Dhabi-based crypto firm that has been issued with an in-principle approval ahead of the country’s forthcoming regulatory framework for crypto asset trading — to discuss how blockchain technology is becoming embedded in daily life in the UAE.In 2018, the UAE launched the Emirate Blockchain Strategy 2021, outlining a plan to migrate at least 50% of government-related transactions onto DLT platforms before the end of this year.When complete, the DLT overhaul is intended to save approximately $3 billion from reduced transaction and document processing, save 77 million work hours, and lower the number of printed documents by 398 million each year. Smith told Cointelegraph the Emirates Blockchain Strategy comprises a “country-wide approach to develop and integrate DLT technology to be embedded in our daily lives.”Smith cited projects launched by Abu Dhabi Ports to use blockchain technology for logistics in 2018 and an initiative from the Dubai Land Department to use DLT to track land ownership, adding: “In terms of digital transactions being embedded in your everyday life, a few examples would be Abu Dhabi Ports developing a blockchain framework for its logistical operations, and the Dubai Land Department developing blockchain solutions to record and register property ownership.”During the recent Future Blockchain Summit conference, Sultan Butti Bin Mejren, the director-general of the DLD, described blockchain as “developing all the economic sectors and bringing forth a qualitative leap in the performance of government work, providing integrated services characterized by ease and convenience.” DLT-based pilot programs are also being implemented in the Dubai Chamber/DP World Silk Road project.On April 15, Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank announced it had become the first Islamic financial institution to successfully complete finance distribution through blockchain technology. Using the DLT-powered trade finance marketplace TradeAssets, ADIB executed multiple cross-border transactions with banking partners over the course of 12 months. Haytham Elmaayergi, the global head of transaction banking at ADIB, said:“ADIB is committed to expanding its digital footprint in trade financing and distribution, enhancing the efficiency and productivity of businesses across the region and globally.” The UAE has taken a methodical approach to the regulation of blockchain and crypto assets, with the Financial Services Regulatory Authority introducing guidance for initial coin offerings in 2017 — simultaneously establishing a foundation for the broader regulation of digital assets within the context of the country’s financial center, the Abu Dhabi Global Market.In 2018, the UAE introduced a framework for operating a crypto asset business that has been further advancing toward a permissive regulatory apparatus. In March of this year, the FSRA updated its regulation to align with the terminology used by the Financial Action Task Force — the intergovernmental Anti-Money Laundering agency of the G-7. The new guidelines changed the previous terminology of “crypto asset” to “virtual asset,” further clarified custody and governance requirements, and introduced regulatory concepts concerning stablecoins.The FRSA claims to have been the world’s first regulator to categorize virtual asset trading under operating a multilateral trading facility — mandating market surveillance, settlement, as well as transaction monitoring obligations, and paving the way for institutions to become active in the space.Only MTF licensees will be permitted to deal in fiat tokens, and any supported stablecoins must be able to demonstrate that they are fully backed on a one-to-one basis by their underlying fiat currency. They will also need to obtain permission for the financial activity of providing money services.The updated guidelines also abandoned the term “security token” in favor of “digital securities”. Securities issued via blockchain technology will be treated the same as securities issued through traditional means. Smith stated that the framework “represents a progressive approach to the regulation of digital securities and virtual assets, providing a leading position for the ADGM as a global hub for regulated digital assets.” He went on to add:“As an International Financial Centre, the FSRA has actively developed a leading global position for virtual assets, digital securities and derivatives. The comprehensive digital asset framework that has been developed presents a contemporary approach to the regulation of digital assets backed onto traditional market infrastructure rules, regulations, and a transparent legal system allowing for engagement with the global economy as an established International Financial Centre.”However, despite the advancement of a permissive regulatory apparatus with regards to blockchain technology and digital asset trading, the UAE has not yet introduced legislation that recognizes crypto assets as a means of payment.On the topic of shifting regulatory trends regarding DLT regulation worldwide, Smith asserted that the varying national legislative frameworks are contributing to a diverse global blockchain ecosystem.Smith noted that jurisdictions, such as Japan, “have taken a proactive legislative approach, developing a framework whereby Bitcoin and potentially other crypto or virtual assets may be used as legal tender that can be used as a form of currency to procure your goods.”He also notes the successes of the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority in “taking a congruent approach to identifying digital assets as a unique asset class.” But, while different jurisdictions have been emphasizing different applications for blockchain technology, Smith pointed to the emergence of a global foundation to a comprehensive legislative apparatus for blockchain: “When juxtaposed against jurisdictions that have also taken a proactive approach, [...] you start to see a global digital asset ecosystem being built.”Smith believes that the blockchain and crypto industries may produce growth during the international coronavirus lock-down, as “alternative investment products such as digital securities” may provide a flexible financial instrument, further adding that digital assets have been “quite resilient in terms of business continuity,” given the current economic circumstances:“If you observe the volumes and or trading activities both in the crypto and virtual asset markets, as well as traditional equity, securities and commodities in the capital markets, the volumes are at an all-time high, and I’ve been told that in terms of on-boarding both to digital assets as well as traditional capital markets and trading platforms, that there is significant increase demand.”"
194,https://cointelegraph.com,,The Case for a Surging Tokenization Demand Following the COVID-19 Pandemic,https://cointelegraph.com/news/the-case-for-a-surging-tokenization-demand-following-the-covid-19-pandemic,"Whether that's the USD, Bitcoin (BTC), some SDR-backed basket digital 
currency or China's incoming digital currency, it appears that tokenized ...",,One of the most curious and subtle developments of the COVID-19 global pandemic is the surging demand for stablecoins. Their total supply hit an all-time high recently — roughly $7.5 billion — with demand for Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC) soaring.,"The development implicitly foreshadows financial disruption as desperate emerging market governments, foreign financial institutions and international businesses compete for a global shortage of dollars. The general consensus for the term of the development is called crypto or digital version of dollarization, and it represents a new take on the dollarization mechanics that have taken place across countries like Argentina and Ecuador before.Unironically, the International Monetary Fund was apparently aware of the potential of such a development back in 2017, detailed by Christine Lagarde. The only defensive posture that governments can take against crypto-dollarization, especially in emerging markets, is an effective and responsible monetary policy.But when the Federal Reserve is throwing the kitchen sink, worth trillions, at the economic fallout of COVID-19, don’t expect other countries to be more prudent in their monetary maneuvers. A looming solvency crisis, stoked by swelling global debt that is denominated in United States dollars, will cause geopolitical fractures in many regions.Companies will likely lean on crypto-dollars, like stablecoins, for enhanced liquidity and access to the USD during the “dash for cash.” And governments may depart the USD reserve hegemony entirely with digital currencies.Stablecoins operate with many of the same characteristics as eurodollars but retain the bearer-instrument quality of cash and the rapid, global settlement execution of cryptocurrencies. Additionally, they are often backed by one to one cash or T-Bill reserves, which makes them more appealing options for entities — like a global supply chain business — with better assurances that their dollars are not subject to the whims of fractional-reserve systems.In the context of empowering citizens as well as companies, stablecoins are an ideal medium to bypass capital controls by obtaining a foreign currency analog (crypto-dollars) without going through the banking system.Stablecoins are widely more accessible than eurodollars for most foreign companies right now. And since they don’t undergo issuance via the credit system, they are basically a more flexible version of the USD that doesn’t have a line of desperate companies and banking institutions lining up to access credit swap lines.Even gold-backed stablecoins, like the new Tether Gold (XAUT) and Paxos’s PAX Gold (PAXG) versions, have been soaring in demand. What’s evident is that besides the dash for dollars, people have been looking for a stable store of value as a hedge against the volatility of markets right now. This leads to the conclusion behind the potential explosion in tokenization that we’re about to witness: Tokenized money or assets makes them widely more accessible, scalable, transparent and programmable.Going back to Christine Lagarde’s comments, she identified how accessing virtual currencies is much easier for foreign institutions, businesses and people. If foreign institutions and businesses and want to dollarize their economy, like what Ecuador has been doing, digital currency is more readily accessible and flexible. For example, a basket of currencies could support a digital currency — e.g., Libra before they bent the knee to regulators — or the monetary policy could be fully transparent, with a programmable contract detailing how the policy adjusts within specific contexts — like a massive decrease in manufacturing output induced by a global pandemic.It’s hard to imagine that governments would so easily forfeit their right to the monopoly over the creation of money, but they may have no choice.People will naturally gravitate toward the hardest money. Whether that’s the USD, Bitcoin (BTC), some SDR-backed basket digital currency or China’s incoming digital currency, it appears that tokenized, digital currencies will be the highest in demand.The widespread adoption of a digital currency or explosive growth in crypto-dollars would likely open the floodgates of tokenization for other assets.Convex events like the supply/demand shock and the economic fallout of COVID-19 expose many of the faults within existing systems. While regulators and the financial sector have largely ignored these signals for decades, the scale of the problem in the real economy, such as small businesses and global supply chains, may require immediate amelioration.To enter tokenized assets seems to be the most obvious decision. However, businesses are largely unaware of the advantages of tokenization nor have a notable amount of businesses dipped into the complex world of tokenization. That’s why it will take an exogenous event (like COVID-19) to provoke a large-scale transition to tokenized assets, which is best viewed through the lens of a global supply chain company.For example, if company A is a private firm based in Singapore and invoices clients in multiple countries via USD, then recent events raise some interesting predicaments. Let’s imagine that company A is a shipping firm carrying commodities around the world’s oceans to various continents.With supply chains virtually paralyzed right now and crude oil prices plummeting, company A may need to raise capital in USD to meet USD-denominated debt obligations. However, USD swap liquidity outside the U.S. is widely only available to central banks directly connected to the Fed — i.e., mainly G7 countries. Private foreign businesses traditionally accustomed to meeting debt obligations and other liabilities with USD cash flows are in a tough position — rapidly diminishing cash flows with no access to USD.One of the fastest and most effective ways to solve company A’s dilemma would be to issue tokenized shipping capacity as redeemable assets that can be redeemed with shipping services, then use a third-party smart contract-based protocol to “transform” the redeemable token into tokenized bonds to investors. If company A has a history of good credit and cash flow, then investors would buy up the tokenized bonds via a global market, raising capital in whatever tokenized currency (e.g., crypto-dollars), cryptocurrency or other programmable assets the company desires.Companies may consider raising money via tokenized bonds outside the confines of stringent regulatory regimes particularly because their desire to raise money in a foreign currency may be at odds with capital controls of the country that their firm is based in. For example, the central bank of Lebanon has recently prohibited firms from acquiring foreign currencies in bulk.By issuing tokenized bonds, not only would secondary markets be liquid for investors on a global settlement layer but the company could quickly exchange the money raised between digital currencies and assets. Overhead costs, like regulatory expenses and fees going through multiple third-parties during the issuance process, would be vastly reduced, too. Access to USD, via crypto-dollars, would circumvent any problems through the conventional banking system that company A would typically be faced with during a dollar crunch.Tokenization cases also extend far beyond the example of company A. The effects of tokenization foster a self-fulfilling prophecy: If more companies, investors and assets rely on digital assets, then the advantages of their interoperability, programmability and accessibility are further augmented.The COVID-19 chaos has exposed the power of crypto-dollars during a liquidity crunch. With powerful tokenization tools already available, the further growth of crypto-dollars may unleash the full potential of tokenization on the other side of this crisis.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.Victor Zhang is the CEO and co-founder of AlphaWallet.

196,https://cointelegraph.com,,MakerDAO Takes New Measures to Prevent Another ‘Black Swan’ Collapse,https://cointelegraph.com/news/makerdao-takes-new-measures-to-prevent-another-black-swan-collapse,"When the spot price of Bitcoin (BTC) and ETH tumbled, market makers seemed 
unable to ensure any form of stability for the market.",,"The decentralized finance lending platform Maker, like many crypto participants, suffered losses during the price collapse of “Black Thursday” on March 12. The price of Ether (ETH) declined by about 50% within 24 hours, triggering opportunistic profiteering as the Maker system became swamped with a huge volume of liquidations.","In the aftermath of the crisis, Maker recorded losses totaling 6.65 million Dai (about $6.65 million) and has been forced to make sweeping changes to its governance and auction parameters. The project also added the stablecoin USD Coin (USDC) to its collateral pool.Amid the losses incurred by the project, Maker community members are calling for compensation for vault holders. However, a lack of consensus over the appropriate percentage of the collateral to be returned, as well as the proper ETH–Dai valuation, might delay any such restitution.The events of Black Thursday represented another significant setback for the DeFi market in 2020, which already saw rogue actors exploit vulnerabilities in flash loans to acquire ETH with zero collateral, thereby causing millions of dollars in losses for projects such as bZx.Before examining the events of Black Thursday, it is important to present a summary of the Maker governance protocol to better understand why the ETH flash crash caused a cascade of liquidations. Simply put, MakerDAO is the base protocol that supports the Dai stablecoin, which is pegged one-to-one with the United States dollar.Apart from Dai, the project also has another token, Maker (MKR), that acts as a governance and equity token. MKR token holders can vote on matters impacting the MakerDAO protocols, including fees and collateralization ratios. By depositing crypto (ETH, BAT, USDC, WBTC) into the Maker smart contract protocol, a user enters into a Collateralized Debt Position, or CDP, which is now called ‘vaults’. The Dai realized from entering the vault is based on the collateralization rate.Since Dai is supposed to maintain a one-to-one peg with the U.S. dollar, any substantial fluctuation in the price of the base collateral, which is ETH, will cause the debt position to close. This situation is indicative of what happened on Black Thursday. When the price of ETH fell, CDPs ended up not having sufficient collateral to stay above the collateralization ratio. Under normal circumstances, the MakerDAO protocol would trigger automatic liquidations to return capital to the market and make the CDPs “debt-free” once again.The first step in the process is a debt auction that sees freshly minted MKR exchanged for Dai that is then burned. The token burn helps to repay the underlying debt even when the ETH value is not sufficient to fully collateralize the position. A second step involves a corresponding collateral auction which involves the buying of MKR tokens with ETH. By selling a sufficient amount of the collateral, the system can accumulate enough capital to cover the debt and the associated fees.Once again, under normal circumstances these two auctions happening concurrently cancel each other out, preventing MKR dilution, as the token is designed to be a deflationary currency. Thus, as long as the ETH price fall does not cause a huge undercollateralization of the CDP and the smart contract protocol can sell the base collateral at or near spot market price, both auctions should see a return to equilibrium of the MakerDAO lending market.The burning of MKR reduces the circulating supply of the token, meaning the value held by vault holders increases. These market participants also receive liquidation fees and sundry accumulated interests from the auctions.As previously reported by Cointelegraph, MakerDAO published a report that provided an examination of the losses incurred from the zero-bids that occurred on Black Thursday. The document compiled the performance of its ETH-collateralized Multi-Collateral Dai — or MCD — system from inception to date as a way of determining a fair compensation formula for affected vault holders.On that fateful Thursday, panic spread across not only the crypto space but the broader financial markets. The previous day, the World Health Organization officially declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic. This announcement happening amid the Russia–OPEC oil price war saw investors moving to exchange investment assets for cash. Within the crypto scene, the sell orders triggered a cascade of liquidations, with the crypto derivatives platform BitMEX seeing about $1.6 trillion in crypto long positions decimated in the market panic.When the spot price of Bitcoin (BTC) and ETH tumbled, market makers seemed unable to ensure any form of stability for the market. Under normal market conditions, market makers profit from the bid–ask spread and provide order book liquidity. However on Black Thursday, market makers that didn’t withdraw their limit orders ended up holding positions deep in the red. With the main liquidity providers underwater, crypto derivatives exchanges began experiencing a liquidity crunch that reverberated across the market, culminating in BTC and ETH dropping by about 50% each.The massive ETH price decline meant that MakerDAO MCD CDP positions became undercollateralized, triggering liquidations. Usually, these liquidations proceed via the two concurrent auctions detailed earlier in the text. However, Black Thursday ended up being a black swan event for MakerDAO as liquidators became swamped by the sheer volume of forced liquidations. An excerpt from the report detailing the nature of the zero-bid exploit reads:“One bidder discovered they could actually win auctions for collateral with effectively 0 DAI bids. 1461 auctions liquidated 62,842.93ETH for no collateral return to 320 vaults and a cost of 6.65M DAI to the Maker system itself. This event was not only costly to the vault holders, but was to the Maker system as well, in capital costs, system confidence, and Maker reputation generally.”According to the report, apart from zero-price bids, half-price bids also occurred during Black Thursday, which contributed to vault holders receiving minimal collateral. The presence of zero-price and half-price bids points to unforeseen issues preventing market participants from submitting bids on particular auctions, allowing rogue actors to acquire ETH with little or no collateral.As stated by the document, 24.7% is the maximum collateral return seen during “good markets.” On average, the period before Black Thursday saw a collateral return of about 17.77%, which fell dramatically to 2.59% on March 12. In a conversation with Cointelegraph, J. R. Forsyth, the founder of the blockchain project Onfo, commented on the absence of robust fail-safe protocols in Maker’s initial architecture to prevent the occurrence of the zero-bids in the first place:“The liquidators of the MakerDAO attack did not cope with their responsibilities. The error in the general code did not allow users to take part in the auction. Moreover, the developers did not develop a fallback scenario in advance that would allow them to update the system, not in 24 hours, but faster.”According to Alex Melikhov, the CEO of the stablecoin platform Equilibrium, the losses incurred by the MakerDAO protocol during Black Thursday have more to do with the project’s shortcomings than the ETH flash crash. In an email to Cointelegraph, Melikhov opined:“If the system could've handled liquidations as initially expected the volatility of the underlying collateral should have nothing to do with the sustainability of the entire debt positions.”For Forsyth, protocols such as Maker should prioritize detailed audits of their smart contracts, adding: “An important part of the security audit of such protocols should be stress testing, which shows how smart contracts behave in an extreme situation.” The latest audit was published in August 2019.MakerDAO lost $6.65 million as a result of the zero-price and half-price bid exploits on Black Thursday. The event exposed vulnerabilities in the project’s governance protocol during periods of heavy liquidation. According to Forsyth, the losses incurred by MakerDAO are indicative of some of the issues plaguing the DeFi space, stating:“Probably, the negative experience of MakerDAO will stimulate the appearance of alternative clients and scenarios that can be run in a short period of time. Recent attacks have shown that DeFi protocols are unstable in conditions of increased volatility. In such periods, complex formulas based on their algorithms cease to work.”For Long Vuong, the CEO of the smart-contract platform Tomochain, projects like Maker should prioritize simpler governance processes that deliver robust security and are resilient to the actions of rogue agents. In a conversation with Cointelegraph, Vuong argued:“The auction system is complex so preventing liquidations due to prices precipitously dropping during a financial panic requires a proper fail-safe plan. Part of this is to simplify and minimize the governance processes to expedite solutions during emergencies.”Following the events of Black Thursday, the Maker community sought to implement protocols that would prevent a situation where keepers were unable to participate in an auction bid. The zero-price and half-price bid exploits only worked because those auctions had only one bidder and were thus able to liquidate ETH with minimum Dai bids.As part of its conclusions in the report, MakerMan, the document’s author, revealed that even during Black Thursday, auctions with multiple bidders returned between 10% and 11% on average to vault holders. With more auction access points added, bid count is reportedly up by 200%, but the collateral return is still far below the 17.77% average during the pre-Black Thursday period. Commenting on the changes made to the MakerDAO governance protocols, Melikhov remarked:“Increasing auction terms to six hours and getting rid of the auction timer seemed to me sufficient technical measures to prevent a recurrence. Other steps were mostly focused on troubleshooting rather than preventing. Good for the MakerDAO project that community committed to participation in MKR auctions through the arisen syndicates and directly.”Following the losses incurred, MakerDAO corrected the collateral shortfall via debt auctions with investors buying newly minted MKR tokens. As previously reported by Cointelegraph, venture fund Paradigm Capital led the auction round, winning about 68% of the MKR sold during the process.Given the fact that the ETH flash crash of Black Thursday triggered the massive liquidations on the platform, MakerDAO has since added the USDC stablecoin as a collateral on its lending market. Commenting on the decision to add USDC as collateral for opening CDPs, Melikhov remarked:“I think that adding USDC collateral was a necessary measure to stabilize the system after a serious stress test and further dramatic losses. Some users were even considering the proposal for USDC collateral as ‘throwing up the white flag’. We saw that DAI’s price started deviating from its one-dollar target after Black Thursday. It was floating above $1 creating an obvious arbitrage opportunity for potential borrowers of DAI who could lock Ether, get DAI at $1, and sell it with premium.”With the collateral return to vault holders still low despite the creation of more auction participation access points, the report called for lot sizes no higher than 50 ETH. According to the document author, larger lot sizes are reducing the auction performance despite the presence of more bidders.Instead of having lot sizes that exceed 50 ETH in a single auction, the report called for a staggering of collateral return, with vault holders receiving half of the total percentage collateral return from smaller lot sizes. The remaining half should then be split between medium and larger lot sizes as a way of creating a baseline for observing auction performance vis-a-vis lot sizes.The report also suggested that auctions for larger lot sizes should include a higher minimum number of bidders to improve bid efficiency. According to the recommendations, only participants with the necessary capital requirement should have access to larger lot size auctions.Apart from providing recommendations for future MakerDAO governance protocol changes, the report also aimed to establish a baseline for compensation considerations. However, responses to the report on the MakerDAO forum show that community members have not yet reached a consensus on the preferred percentage collateral return to affected vault holders, as well as an appropriate ETH–Dai valuation."

Blockchain",https://cointelegraph.com/news/world-economic-forums-nadia-hewitt-talks-supply-chains-covid-19-and-blockchain,"Public blockchains such as Bitcoin are much more developed, and we see a 
number of solutions in the public chain space that are tackling ...",,"Last week, the World Economic Forum (WEF) published a major new blockchain deployment toolkit designed to help governments, enterprises and organizations worldwide to develop more resilient value chains going forward after the COVID-19 crisis. ","The toolkit’s authors believe that the case for blockchain implementation is stronger than ever in the wake of the pandemic and has major potential to help with the global economic recovery through an innovative digitization of trade.  Recognizing that “a fair share of puzzlement and anxiety” persists among supply chain actors when it comes to the blockchain, the toolkit tackles not only technology, but also key areas such as governance, interoperability, digital identity, cybersecurity, and regulatory compliance.Cointelegraph spoke to one of the toolkit’s authors, Nadia Hewett — project lead for blockchain and digital currency at the World Economic Forum — about the core ideas and vision behind the new project.Marie Huillet: The COVID-19 pandemic has provided the global community with a striking X-ray of the interconnectedness and, in many cases, fragility of global supply chains. There has been some discussion of — and pushback against — the notion that the crisis could eventuate in calls for some form of deglobalization, involving the ""onshoring"" of production for critical goods, especially when it comes to medical supplies and food. Many others say that it is implausible that states and enterprises can reverse decades of liberalization and retreat back into autarky. In all scenarios, a focus on improving resilience and diversification would seem to be on the agenda.MH: How does the World Economic Forum view the role of blockchain in developing the technological and infrastructural support for the evolution of supply chains going forward?NH: I would say that the WEF’s new toolkit takes both a technical and non-technical approach to the deployment of blockchain. The extent to which any of the benefits of the technology are maximized heavily depends on the quality of governance protocols — and beyond this, upon establishing policies, norms, standards and regulations. Governance protocols need to be stable and predictable enough to foster confidence — not just between states but also between enterprises, scientists, the general public and investors.So it’s not that we're promoting the technology per se. Blockchain does have qualities that can help build resilience and transparency into supply chains, but the mechanisms we deploy need to allow for policymakers to interact at the cutting edge of technological and scientific research. It's for that reason that the WEF Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution is designed to serve as a hub for public-private collaboration. More than ever, we need a global and trusted space where leading companies can forge partnerships to develop those agile policies and norms.So that’s the reason the toolkit is not just tech-focused. The project actually takes a very holistic approach to what it would take for blockchain to assist with resilience and agility, to bring trusted data to supply chain ecosystems and into value chains. For example, many of the modules in the toolkit cover topics such as legal and regulatory compliance, they touch on different laws in various jurisdictions. If we take the issue of data sharing — personal data sharing is not merely a technical matter, it’s also a question of regulations, as with the EU’s GDPR.MH: Can you talk us through how that holistic approach has played out in how you constructed the WEF’s blockchain toolkit? NH: Let’s focus on interoperability. In the context of supply chains, that raises questions of transparency, because trusting the data you see all across the value chain depends on achieving end-to-end interoperability. And if you look at our toolkit module, you’ll see it’s not only focused on the technical aspects, but that we’ve built three further layers into our approach: the top layer — the business model layer, involving governance — commercial models, and the legal framework. Interoperability is a good example of where the technology is not the problem, but rather governance. It’s the willingness of governments, companies, of all stakeholders to work together. We need interoperability at all those layers to intervene effectively in supply chains, to solve the issues we’ve seen exposed in recent weeks. MH: International cooperation has arguably been compromised by both commercial and geopolitical competing interests during this crisis, and technology — a critical area going forward — has at times been at the center of these conflicts, e.g. with disputes over intellectual property, data privacy and standards setting. What degree of inter-state collaboration do you think is needed for realizing the opportunities offered by blockchain and do you anticipate any particular challenges?NH: A lot of the problems we’re seeing are, of course, not new. One big challenge we face is fragmentation into data silos. That existed already before the COVID-19 pandemic. Many incumbents do not want to share data; they see it as a way to protect their own competitive advantage. Stakeholders artificially create data barriers and silos and there's a difficulty in getting parties to take a different approach. What does it look like when we share data with each other? How could you design it in a way that everyone is incentivized to do so, so that the different parties are awarded for sharing data? Here blockchain as a technology for supply chains has great potential. You can share data in a privacy-preserving way, which wasn't possible before. With many supply chain stakeholders, both in the public and private sector, you see that there's a perceived loss of control over data. That's a huge barrier and blockchain technology can help to mitigate exactly this perceived loss of control. A blockchain system never requires an organization to reveal more data than it is comfortable with. Onchain data can be encrypted so that it's only visible by authorized parties. When supply chain organizations deploy a blockchain solution they have real flexibility to ensure it addresses both data protection and privacy concerns.MH: Are there any other sticking points you have identified that may be affecting efficient cooperation, both in the public and private sectors?NH: Of course we have to be aware of the legal and regulatory barriers that continue to exist. To solve this we’ll need international cooperation. A node on the blockchain can be located anywhere in the world, it can cross jurisdictional boundaries. And of course, global value chains themselves cross these boundaries. Today, that poses a number of complex jurisdictional issues for participants in a blockchain network and also for the contractual relationships between them.In addition to legal frameworks like GDPR, which have cross-territorial effects, blockchain users and nodes all around the world each have local regimes to deal with. So for anyone who is designing an innovative blockchain solution for supply chains, the kinds of solutions they can devise and actually implement remain limited to an extent.Stakeholders are having to cope with many of these cross-jurisdictional issues while governments continue to work out both international and local rules. To solve it properly, you need to get all the players around the table from day one; that's not an easy thing. It’s very intentional that we’ve included topics like auditing and financial reporting, tax implications, and so on, in our modules. These are vast and diverse topics. We are really trying to encourage an approach whereby you have all the stakeholders involved in the process from the get-go, whether they be tech developers or lawyers. This goes for the public and the private sector, and for collaborations between them.MH: You’ve emphasized the need to have a plurality of stakeholders involved and as wide and inclusive a vision as possible —even just to solve one commercial hurdle or a single policy coordination.Do you think that this recent shock will spur greater willingness to tackle these complex challenges head on? Are private actors and states now more likely to recognize that developing resilience is necessarily tied to a framework of interdependence and coordination?Nadia Hewett: Firstly, I would emphasize that the issues we face with supply chains — for example, the persistent lack of willingness to share data — are not unique to international value chains. We face a lack of visibility and transparency, difficulties with data integrity, a lack of real-time data, difficulty integrating data from Internet of Things technologies — all these challenges exist both for domestic and international supply chains. I would also point out that we’ve seen major international disruptions to supply chains in the past, as for example with E. coli. The United States renegotiated contracts for ports with their labor unions in 2002, 2005 and 2012. There were weeks of disruptions to supply chains at that time. People forget that now. And at that time we saw various firms coming up with proofs-of-concept (PoCs), pandemic insurance PoCs, for example. But after a while, people went back to what they used to do, the momentum just wasn’t there. Many of those PoCs, including those involving blockchain, were shelved. Other things became more important. Yet now in the past few weeks we've seen those companies going back to those PoCs, dusting them off and taking a look again. The momentum is significantly greater than what we've seen before. Public and private sector actors are looking at what they already knew — and, in some cases, had already tested. Previously they didn’t have a sufficient push or willingness to tackle all the interoperability issues we've discussed, all the complex pieces that are involved. MH: Are you seeing any evidence that the pandemic is already encouraging actors to take the kinds of holistic and interlocking approaches you believe to be necessary?  NH: Now, as you can imagine the momentum is there, a recognition that we need to get this right, and this applies whether we source regionally or internationally. Following the pandemic there will definitely be regional sourcing to some extent, it’s inevitable.The difficulty is that when the media reports on issues with supply chains they tackle the impact at a macro level, but it's impossible to look with a broad brush at supply chains and conclude with any meaningful insights; you need to take a much more granular approach.  For example, we have commodity markets, or PPE, medical supplies, footwear, textiles, military equipment, and project cargo for infrastructure development. The impact of this crisis will play out very differently depending on which value chains we're talking about, there's a degree of nuance that we need to preserve. MH: You’ve spoken about interoperability being a much broader question than just one involving technology. Yet if we set aside for a moment questions of governance, legal and regulatory aspects, all those layers that are connected with blockchain’s implementation for global value chains, is there any particular aspect of blockchain that you would say needs particular development?NH: I would say that in the enterprise blockchain sector, there’s still a long way to go with standardization. There's no sign yet of a single platform. Public blockchains such as Bitcoin are much more developed, and we see a number of solutions in the public chain space that are tackling questions of interoperability. At the enterprise level, interoperability is still very much at its beginning stage, and the problem here again is one of incentives. How can we spur solution vendors to work more intensively together? One thing we’ve been seeing in recent years is a proliferation of blockchain consortiums. Specific industries are forming dedicated blockchain consortiums, working on problems specific to their industry. Say, for example, the Mobility Open Blockchain Initiative, or consortiums for the mining and metal industries. These tend to cooperate on very specific industry problems and I expect these kinds of consortiums will continue for the next couple of years and will help to set data standards and industry-wide solutions. But the challenge is to encourage work on interoperability, on infrastructure and platforms, that could cross over into other sectors. For now, any data standardization beyond an industry’s particular use case —which is what we really need — remains secondary. MH: Staying a bit longer with the technology, it would be interesting to hear more thoughts on what the WEF’s toolkit defines as the trade-offs between decentralized and centralized components of blockchain systems. Can you relate these trade-offs to the kinds of multi-layered public-private sector interactions we’ve been speaking about?NH: It’s important to recognize that many supply chain processes today use technologies that are designed for siloed centralized systems. So for supply chain companies to really take advantage of blockchain, they need to conduct a review both of the process and the technology. Governments and businesses must recognize that a business process that is inherently centralized, or designed based on centralized trust, might not actually be effective using a blockchain system. The way we see it is that decentralization is not an all-or-nothing objective. Unlike for the public blockchain space, when you talk about enterprise systems — about supply chains which have for decades been based on centralized trust controls — you need a balanced objective. This does require tradeoffs, for practical reasons, and a system might well require both centralized and decentralized components. That being said, of course, it's very important to remember that the decentralization benefits do degrade, that distributed ledger solutions can very quickly become diluted the more centralized components you have. So that brings you back again to looking at whether you really have a business problem for which blockchain really is the most appropriate technology.MH: Before you go, are there any particular areas within supply chains which you have identified as likely to benefit from a blockchain solution? NH: There are, of course, but I think that in general one could point to the concept of a “shared truth” — the fact that what I see is what you see.This is particularly important when you need to establish the provenance of a product; to establish traceability, transparency, where it comes from. Is your truth my truth? Wherever it's really important that what I see is what you see, that is where blockchain has so much to offer for supply chains.Looking at the pandemics we’ve faced in the past, a lot of the issues arose from livestock mishandling or food quality issues, again recalling e.coli. Can I trust where this product comes from? With blockchain, the fact that we have a shared truth here becomes really useful.This goes for any use case where having a trusted data piece is critically important. When you look at medical supply chains right now amid the COVID-19 pandemic, we’ve been seeing issues with counterfeit ventilators. Overnight, you need to be able to verify whether you are dealing with credible suppliers. So blockchain can enable that shared version of truth, which is so vital for securing data integrity and trust."
