It is in a bear market.That is bad news if you are a short-term holder and good news if you are a long-term acquirer.I reiterate, all you need to know is which way bitcoin (BTC) is going in the long term to develop a very profitable strategy. Get the direction wrong and you will lose. If you don’t “know” the direction, you are ill advised to play.I believe the direction is up and significantly up, but for now in the short term it is down.Now to get a view of how things can pan out it’s best to remove as much noise as possible. The easy way to do this is to use moving averages. The trouble is everyone is doing that, which tends to weaken the usefulness of that tool. Anyway, here is BTC with a 200 moving day average, which is the long-term indicator many watch.The Bitcoin chart with a 200 movign day averageClassically, the current breakdown would be considered bearish. I’m not a fan of moving averages because they change with the current price as it changes, so that leaves a misleading trail. They also tell you after the event that things are bearish. Now the moving average says the market is moving up on average and only gives a sell hugely below the high. In volatile markets this is a chronic problem.So what I sometimes do is “doctor” the chart manually to de-noise it. The recent sharp rise and fall is pure noise:The recent fall and rise on the Bitcoin chart is pure noiseSomething hit the price then an event (the president of China spoke on blockchain) poked it up. These events are outside of “the trend” so let’s imagine they didn’t happen. Like a soviet political artist, let’s airbrush these inconvenient events from history.You get this:The Bitcoin chart with the noise removedNow that’s a pretty clear picture. Bitcoin is tanking towards a capitulation. That bottom looks to be quite near in terms of time but the bottom is hard to call. Here are some ideas:Some suggestions about where the bottom might be for BitcoinI think the high and low bounds are unlikely but you can’t really guess or for that matter buy the low because a capitulation, even though it looks important on the chart later, is often an ephemeral moment that only exists for minutes and trades little volume.To reverse this trend will not take much but to do so will need a catalyst and there is none in sight at the moment.

Cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple and Litecoin showed unprecedented growth in 2017, growing more than 5000%, with market-leader Bitcoin topping out at nearly 20,000 USD per Bitcoin just before the new year. Since then however, the whole cryptocurrency sector has declined dramatically losing over 80% it's value. In recent days, Bitcoin has dropped sharply to new yearly-lows to around 4300 USD at the time of writing. The sector has divided opinions within financial circles with some leading figures claiming it's revolutionary effects on the monetary system, whilst others calling it nothing other than a speculative bubble. (Photo by Jordan Mansfield/Getty Images)","Things are stirring in the cryptocurrency world. There is a burgeoning debate about central bank issued digital currencies, and in the past month bitcoin has fallen by over thirty percent, with a sharp acceleration downwards in recent days. In its short life as a trading asset, bitcoin has appeared to move in sync with equities, so this recent move may spark some concern. A more intriguing, related question is whether bitcoin is an indicator of risk appetite or a beneficiary of risk aversion. Indeed, within the less ‘independent’ crypto currency community there is a view abroad that bitcoin and crypto currencies are a ‘safe haven’ in the same way people might for instance, regard gold. Bitcoin Down Over 30%My own sense is that crypto currencies in general and bitcoin specifically are not safe havens. They have failed the purpose they were intended to fulfill in that they are not actively used as a means of exchange. Few retailers accept them, fewer consumers actively use them and transaction costs are still very high. The technology associated with cryptocurrencies is also complex enough to dissuade most households from using them. For many people the process of setting up a crypto wallet, and mentally translating crypto prices into everyday currencies is too demanding to bother with. This ‘ease of use’ is a cognitive barrier to entry and something that will take time for many to overcome, even Millennials. In addition, the infrastructure around cryptocurrencies is fragile in at least two respects. Parts of that system, such as exchanges are prone to hacking and ransoming, and can also be shut down at the whim of governments. Bitcoin Not A Safe HavenFrom the point of view of cryptocurrencies as assets, very basic data analysis suggests that optically bitcoin has a low correlation with safe havens like gold. This does not mean that bitcoin is a good diversifier or a safe haven. It has been highly volatile over the past two years and is subject to trading and liquidity risks not normally associated with safe havens. A further clue as to the true nature of cryptocurrencies as investable assets comes from the community of people who hold and trade them. The micro-structure (or plumbing) of markets, as well as the anthropology and sociology of those who populate them (which will have to be the subject of a future missive) is crucial to the way they behave and subsequently to their risk characteristics. In this light the fact that the biggest holder of bitcoins is apparently the FBI says a lot. A good deal of trading in cryptocurrencies takes place in Asia, other emerging markets like Russia and in hubs like Zug. Though admittedly not scientific, nor thorough, I suspect that many bitcoin traders also trade equity futures and currencies and use the same equity trading rules (technical) to buy and sell bitcoin (cryptos now have their own rating system, FCAS). If this generalization holds, it suggests that risk budgeting may drive a positive correlation between cryptocurrencies and equities, especially at market highs and lows. Another observation is that for its size (the top ten cryptocurrencies barely add up to the market cap of Citigroup) the crypto market attracts an inordinately large amount of attention, which may draw money in at high points. To my mind this points to bitcoin having a pro-cyclical bias in terms of its riskiness as a trading asset. Authorities React With Digital CurrenciesOn a structural basis the fall in bitcoin may also signal trouble in the cryptocurrency world, which effectively exists to create means of exchange beyond the normal frameworks of governments and central banks. Note that bitcoin rallied to its year high in the immediate aftermath of Facebook’s announcement of the Libra project in mid June. The current disarray surrounding Facebook’s Libra project is a sign of the operating and regulatory complexities facing cryptocurrencies. More powerful still is the incentive that central banks and fiscal authorities around the world have for the bitcoin not to succeed. Witness as an example the vigour with which the Chinese – who tightly control money flows – have clamped down on cryptocurrency exchanges. The next steps in the crypto or digital currency (they are almost the same in that crypto currencies are digital currencies that use cryptography) industry for central banks to issue their own coins, and for the digital payments industry. More thorough regulation, cleaner cross-border payment processes and more reliable identification mechanisms will be part of the workload of central banks and governments. It all suggests that instead of being a safe haven, bitcoin may become extinct. "

[+] Pilot Area in southwest China's Guizhou Province, May 22, 2019. (Photo by Ou Dongqu/Xinhua via Getty) (Xinhua/Ou Dongqu via Getty Images)","Crypto markets are not reeling this week because China is “cracking down on Blockchain.” Tokens have been getting slammed since the summer because most of them are unnecessary, and because the need for coins that may offer some utility is not as imminent as buyers thought it would be. This is most obvious with King Crypto, bitcoin, whose purported use-case as a store of value is not looking very compelling.The risk-reward in bitcoin has always been an extreme one, which is why its biggest proponents/salespeople assigned astronomic price targets to it. Widespread adoption is an extremely low-probability event with an enormous payoff if the stars align. And let’s be clear: the things that need to happen for the world to turn to bitcoin – complete central bank impotence, widespread currency debasement, falling equity markets and the abandonment of traditional gold – means betting on bitcoin is essentially betting against the house. Hence the “short bankers, long bitcoin” meme. To say bitcoin will offer a 100x return yet also say it’s a highly probabilistic event is inherently contradictory and hugely dishonest.The market is now realizing this. As the global economic slowdown of the last nine months shows signs of stabilization and the Federal Reserve sees no need for more interest-rate cuts, the case for bitcoin is taking body blows. None of the stories about adoption are turning out, big tech giants from Facebook to Google are doing everything possible to dominate electronic pay and finance, and projects designed to make bitcoin a means of exchange are either slow, fruitless, or both.In short, the house does not look like it’s in a losing position just yet. And so bitcoin is getting killed. Sure, the U.S. and China could have a major fallout, get into a currency war, and Chinese citizens could rush to crypto as a way to get money out of the system. That’s why bitcoin will never be worthless, and why every investor should watch its price action, but that scenario is looking way, way further away from reality than the cryptoknights had so many believe.Bitcoin’s violent moves are a factor of the speculative nature described above. Because its probability of success is low, it is closer to a roulette wheel than any traditional asset class. Average people were lured into the bitcoin sales pitch in 2017 when the economy was tearing hot, cash flow was heavy, stocks were churning out huge gains, and people could afford to take a gamble. Why not roll the dice?Now those buyers are losing faith in their chances of winning, and are using this year’s rally to get out. As the fundamental reason for owning bitcoin as a store of value also loses luster amid a stabilizing economic situation, the true believers may start bailing out too. If it continues, it should be a warning sign to more traditional investors who made a similar bet in gold, and maybe even those who ran to Treasury bonds as a hedge against chaos, too."

Google does not currently share data from its Google Pay service, which boasted an estimated 11.1 million U.S. users last year, with advertisers. The move by Google follows the launch of Apple's Goldman Sachs-backed credit card this last summer, ride-hailing app Uber's offer of bank accounts and credit to its drivers, and Amazon's plans to introduce personal accounts for its customers.Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies have, meanwhile, struggled to attract new users and retail acceptance with price speculation still the biggest driver of bitcoin interest.The bitcoin price rallied earlier this year amid reports some of the world's biggest technology ...

Micro-blogging platform Twitter, led by the chief executive of payments company Square, Jack Dorsey, is a Silicon Valley outlier for its support of bitcoin.And public opinion is with the tech companies. Last month, Apple, Google, and Amazon were found to be the most valuable brands in the world, according to Interbrand's annual survey. Despite public concerns around data-privacy, digital security and the power of tech giants, users have failed to abandon their services–Google's superior digital money service could be a greater threat to bitcoin than its quantum supremacy."

""It’s because of Lightning Network and OpenNode and maybe others that are allowing us to spend bitcoin very freely and quickly, so that it’s not just a store of value but it can be used for micro-payments; it can be used for retail, it can be used all over.""Bitcoin's Lightning Network has long been touted by some as a potential game changer for bitcoin and crypto payments, though adoption has not come as quickly as some had hoped. Elsewhere, Changpeng Zhao, the chief executive of the world's largest bitcoin and crypto exchange by volume Binance, said he expects the bitcoin price to rise simply as the bitcoin industry grows. ""If you look at the fundamental technology and a longer term view, across a five year or ten year horizon, we're very confident the industry will get bigger and when the industry gets bigger the prices will go higher,"" Changpeng Zhao, who's often known simply as CZ, told Bloomberg, a financial newswire. ""If you look at the short term view, bitcoin and cryptocurrency is a smaller market cap instrument so there will be higher volatility,"" CZ added, attempting to explain away bitcoin's recent downward trend. The bitcoin price, after a strong start to the year, has fallen steadily over the last few months. Meanwhile, bitcoin and cryptocurrency analyst Tom Lee has said bitcoin will need to pass $150,000 per bitcoin, a rise of over 1,600% from current prices, before a long-awaited bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) could work.Lee, who founded strategy research boutique Fundstrat Global Advisors, thinks that though ""demand for an ETF is monstrous,"" the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) ""needs to punt the ETF until crypto becomes bigger.""According to Lee, a significant increase in the bitcoin price will increase investor confidence in bitcoin and crypto–but proper regulation and oversight will be needed.

[+] bitcoin has staged something of a recovery in 2019.Researchers John Griffin and Amin Shams, finance professors at the University of Texas and Ohio State University, respectively, found that around half of bitcoin's value between March 2017 and March 2018 was created by trades between bitcoin and tether, a so-called stablecoin with links to the British Virgin Islands-based Bitfinex bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchange. Bitfinex and Tether Ltd, which controls the stablecoin tether, are owned by the same people and the two companies share senior staff.Earlier this year, tether surpassed bitcoin in daily and monthly trading volume to become the most traded cryptocurrency on the market.According to the researchers, an unidentified Bitfinex account used tether to manipulate the bitcoin price by creating unprecedented demand for the digital token. Over the period, the total market value of bitcoin soared to $326 billion, from $16 billion at the beginning of the year. Bitcoin's market capitalization is now around $165 billion, making it the most valuable cryptocurrency by a considerable margin. ""Even a fairly small amount of capital can manipulate the price of bitcoin,"" Griffin told the Wall Street Journal newspaper, which first reported the study.""If it’s not Bitfinex, it’s somebody they do business with very frequently.""""We find that the identified patterns are not present on other flows, and almost the entire price impact can be attributed to this one large player,"" Griffin and Shams wrote. ""We map this data across both blockchains and find that the one player or entity (labeled as 1LSg throughout the paper) is behind the majority of the patterns we document.""The pair of researchers examined the entire transaction history of bitcoin and tether for the study–a data set of 200 gigabytes.The findings of the study will add fuel to speculation tether has been used to manipulate the bitcoin price. Last year, U.S. federal prosecutors began investigating whether tether trading had been used to move the bitcoin price. The bitcoin price has remained highly volatile since its 2017 bull run, though has failed to return ... [+] to its all-time high of almost $20,000 per bitcoin.The study could potentially worry bitcoin traders, many of whom believe bitcoin's incredible 2017 surge was due to banks and other institutional investors eying the bitcoin and cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin's subsequent fall to around $3,500 in 2018 has been explained through regulatory fears and some institutions thought to be interested in bitcoin parking their crypto plans. This year, bitcoin has rallied somewhat, climbing back above $10,000 per bitcoin, following reports social media giant Facebook, among other big technology companies, are interested in bitcoin and blockchain technology.Facebook has announced plans to release its own bitcoin competitor, dubbed libra, some time next year but has run into fierce governmental push back, with some companies who had signed up to Facebook's independent Libra Association dropping out.

The world’s most prominent digital currency fell to as little as $8,666.39 around 10 a.m. EDT, having lost nearly 6% of its value in less than 24 hours, CoinDesk data shows. At this point, the cryptocurrency was trading at its lowest since October 25, additional CoinDesk figures reveal.

Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.]After struggling in this manner, the digital currency could suffer additional losses, noted Joe DiPasquale, CEO of cryptocurrency hedge fund manager BitBull Capital. “Bitcoin was overbought after the late October surge,” he stated, which coincided with statements by China’s president that it was imperative to “seize the opportunity” presented by blockchain technology. Following this sharp rally, bitcoin “consolidated for a bit before breaking downward,” said DiPasquale. When explaining why the digital currency might face further downside, the hedge fund manager cited technical analysis. “Presently, the 50-day moving average is acting as support around the $8,600 level,” he emphasized. “While we expect the price to respect this level, a re-test of the $8,000 range cannot be ruled out” at this time.”DiPasquale described the sharp price gains that bitcoin enjoyed in late October as “unsustainable,” noting that they “resulted in major profit-taking.” John Todaro, director of digital currency research for TradeBlock, offered a similar point of view. “Bitcoin, and the digital currency market in general, posted a strong rally following the Chinese President's comments in October, and you are starting to see prices come back some as investors tease out the actual implications of his comments,” he stated. “It is still unclear to the extent, if any, China will actually embrace digital currencies and non-sovereign assets such as bitcoin or if the country is simply embracing private blockchains.”Going forward, he emphasized that bitcoin’s lackluster trading activity makes it vulnerable to notable price fluctuations. “Bitcoin has seen renewed volatility over the past 10 days and could easily push past support/resistance levels during times with thinly traded markets.”Disclosure: I own some bitcoin, bitcoin cash, litecoin, ether and EOS. "

Chainlink, an ethereum token that powers the Chainlink decentralized oracle network allowing smart contracts on ethereum to connect to external data sources, APIs, and payment systems, has managed to stage a strong recovery since the late summer sell-off, breaking away from the wider bitcoin and crypto market, which has been falling steadily.Some of chainlink's recent gains could be due to its efforts to expand into China just as China's president Xi Jinping has revealed the country will work to widely incorporate blockchain technology over coming years. In April, the Chainlink organization hired a Chinese community manager.Last month, Chainlink teamed up with Binance, the world's largest bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchange by volume, to develop blockchain and smart contract-based so-called decentralized finance products, including lending, derivatives, and decentralized exchanges.Back in June, the Chainlink organization began working with search giant Google and enterprise software company Oracle to help bridge their legacy payment systems and databases using blockchain technology.

At this point, the cryptocurrency was down almost 20% from its recent high of more than $10,300 reached in October, additional CoinDesk figures reveal. Going forward, bitcoin will probably suffer additional losses before it moves higher, predicted analysts. Jacob Canfield, founder of Signal Profits, summed the situation up nicely.“One thing is painfully clear,” he stated. “We are definitely in a downtrend.”Joe DiPasquale, CEO of cryptocurrency hedge fund manager BitBull Capital, offered a similar perspective, emphasizing technical analysis to make his case. Bitcoin “is trading below the 50-day moving average,” of $8,600, “which was acting as support throughout last week,” he noted. “We can expect the price to find temporary relief around $8,400 and $8,200,” stated DiPasquale. However, “a drop to $8,000 is a real possibility,” he emphasized. The analyst noted that $8,700 is providing “immediate resistance, but Bitcoin appears unlikely to attempt it going into the weekend.”“This continued downward trend is not surprising,” said Joshua Frank, cofounder of digital analytics platform TheTIE.io. He described the losses that bitcoin has been experiencing lately as inevitable, claiming that the 40% climb the cryptocurrency experienced last October was “an irrational move” that was “not driven by sentiment.”Bitcoin’s Lackluster SentimentFrank offered some sentiment data on the world’s most prominent digital currency, providing some figures that failed to paint a rosy picture. “Tweet volumes on Bitcoin have declined by over 50% since this summer and we have not seen any catalyst to suggest that this trend will change,” said Frank, citing figures provided by TheTIE.io. “We saw a slight bump in tweet volume driven by Bitcoin’s massive 40% movement, but that interest has since subsided,” he stated. “At the same time we have seen a pretty consistent decline in long-term sentiment on BTC.”The chart below helps depict bitcoin’s long-term sentiment compared to its 30-day average tweet volume: Bitcoin's long-term sentiment vs. its 30-day average tweet volume. Bitcoin’s Consolidation PhaseIn spite of the bearish input provided by some market observers, others noted that bitcoin has been in a consolidation phase. “There has been a longer term consolidating trend in digital currencies since the summer, as trading volumes have fallen close to the 2 year low that was seen in early 2019, despite the recent uptick in activity and price action that we saw in October,” said John Todaro, director of digital currency research for TradeBlock. Marius Rupsys, a digital currency investor , also weighed in, noting that “If you look at yearly performance, bitcoin moved from $3,500 up to $13,800.”“Now we are just consolidating given the move was so fast and strong. So all this price action is sideways with short term bulls and bears until we find longer term trend - either bull or bear,” stated Rupsys.

When it comes to these opportunities, it can be difficult to discern which is the wiser investment choice for you. Both have benefits and, like all investments, carry risk.","If you have been considering these assets and are looking to select the option that’s a good fit for you, let’s examine the pros and cons of each investment. Keep in mind before making any investment decisions to perform your due diligence and consult your financial advisor.Breaking It Down: Real Estate InvestmentReal estate investment is the purchasing of property with the intent of renting or selling it to make a profit. This is a multifaceted investment. You can flip homes, rent business space, be a residential landlord, rent out vacation property or open an Airbnb.Real estate investing can help diversify your portfolio. Property is also a tangible investment; you can pull money from it and put value back into it. With a proper purchase and research, you can bring in money while putting value into a sellable asset. Additionally, owning property comes with tax breaks.However, a great deal of effort is involved when it comes to real estate investment. Keeping up with property requires regular maintenance, upgrade and repairs. Owners need to collect rent and worry about utilities, not to mention that purchasing property can be pricey upfront.Also, property is not an entirely fluid asset. Although you can sell property, it can sometimes be difficult to unload. It takes time to sell, and there’s a chance you might pour a lot of money into something that does not equal out. On the other hand, people need somewhere to live, so real estate will always be a necessity.Pros:• Tangible asset.• Versatile investment opportunities.• Tax benefits.• High cash flow.• Long-term returns.Cons:• Not a fluid asset.• Costly investment.• High maintenance.Breaking It Down: Bitcoin InvestmentCryptocurrency, the most popular of which is bitcoin, is one of the newest investment options available. These digital currencies act as a medium of exchange globally as an alternative to money. They are technological currency backed by blockchain technology.One big benefit of bitcoin investment is the currency can never be inflated, since there will always be a limited number of bitcoins to go around. There’s also not much involved in purchasing the currency. You obtain your cryptocurrency wallet, purchase your bitcoin and mine. The currency is global and can be sold easily on a cryptocurrency exchange. Transactions are marked in the blockchain, which is publicly available, and bitcoin is currently in high demand.However, as great as all these perks may be, there are some risk factors. Since bitcoin is an intangible asset, there’s a fair bit of room for error in exchange. The currency is entirely digital, which makes it open to cyberattacks, and security isn’t ironclad. Also, although there are only a limited number of bitcoins, there are many other types of cryptocurrency available that could inflate the market.Additionally, since this asset is so new, there’s not enough data to really calculate its value. As recent price fluctuations show, the market is volatile. You could easily lose everything you invest, so the decision of whether or not to get involved with bitcoin really comes down to how much you are willing to risk.Pros:Peer-to-peer system.Governed by economic principles.No inflation.Easy to trade.Long-term potential.No maintenance.Lower cost.Cons:• Bubble — inflates and fizzles out.• Not a tangible asset.• Security issues.• Little/no government involvement.• High risk.Which investment comes out on top? As you build out your investment portfolio, your best investment really depends on your personal financial background, your familiarity with the asset and how much you are willing to risk. Purchasing bitcoin is low-maintenance and high-risk with the potential for high reward, while real estate is a long-term investment that could end in a big payout down the road or provide steady income. So it’s ultimately up to what you can afford and what you can afford to lose.The information provided here is not investment, tax or financial advice.

While most were not expecting to retire on these investments overnight, they also did not foresee the bitcoin price dropping 80% (from $20,000 to below $4,000) in the next twelve months.This year’s conversations might still turn acrimonious, but they will likely have more to do with President Trump’s impeachment hearings, the 2020 election, or the perilous state of the global economy. That said, there is still much to discuss regarding crypto. Here is what everyone should know before they sit down for that 2:30 pm dinner.The Price of Bitcoin, Ether, and other Crypto Assets Are Rebounding If your Uncle Charlie was unfortunate enough to buy into the market in late December 2017, he is probably still licking his wounds. However, most people probably do not realize that the prices of bitcoin and ether have at least doubled since their nadirs at the end of 2018. ·      The bitcoin price has risen from slightly above $3,000 to $8,300 today ·      Ethereum has moved from $84 to just above $175These gains may not make everyone whole, but they are encouraging. Additionally, there is a significant increase in institutional interest in the space, lending platforms continue to expand, and financial markets are diversifying into products such as derivatives. All of this will add transparency, reduce fraud and arbitrage opportunities, and make regulators happy.Crypto is in the Spotlight like Never BeforeIn what was probably beyond Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto’s wildest dreams, bitcoin entered the presidential twittersphere. On July 11th President Trump directed a series of tweets at bitcoin, libra (Facebook’s coin – i.e. Zuck buck), and cryptocurrencies writ large, dismissing them as unregulated assets with no innate value or use cases other than to support illicit activity.The president has almost 67 million followers on Twitter, and the reach of these quotes is far higher when one takes into account press reports and shares. To people who avoided the 2017 hype, this was bitcoin’s coming out party.It is almost irrelevant that the posts cast crypto in a negative light because:·      Crypto represents a threat to the U.S. dollar’s global dominance, which has been a driver of U.S. economic prosperity for decades. It is also useful when it comes to sanctions. If President Trump made a statement, it was likely going to be negative.·      Most observers recognize that governments are risk adverse, especially when it comes to money·      If President Trump felt it necessary to tweet about bitcoin, Libra, and crypto he must feel that there is more substance than smoke And now 67 million people are curious.Mark Zuckerberg Became the Hero Crypto Deserved, but not the One It WantedIf the presidential spotlight wasn’t bright enough, Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg brought it into solar-eclipse territory when the company announced its stablecoin initiative, Libra, in June. (For readers unfamiliar with stablecoins, they are a novel form of crypto asset that is designed to maintain a constant peg to an asset such as the U.S. dollar. Libra will actually be pegged to a basket of global reserve currencies).The announcement was widely criticized amongst regulators and populations around the world for a couple of reasons.The Facebook CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, testified before the House Financial Services Committee on ... [+] Wednesday, October 23, 2019 Washington, D.C. (Photo by Aurora Samperio/NurPhoto via Getty Images)·      There remain multiple legitimate questions about how Libra will operate as an open platform yet remain secure and compliant with global sanctions and relevant regulations·      Facebook’s reputation is at an all-time low, much of it stemming from incidents such as the Cambridge Analytica scandal and growing concerns about the company’s privacy policies. So why would anyone want to now give the company access to their financial data?Mark Zuckerberg actually acknowledged the irony of the Libra announcement when he testified in front of Congress this fall. In his opening statement he said, “I’m sure people wish it was anyone but Facebook putting this idea forward”.It remains to be seen when or if Libra ever gets off the ground, but regardless Facebook did crypto a favor. It again highlighted how the current financial system has failed to onboard the 1.7 billion people who are unbanked, underscoring one of crypto’s main value propositions.Now More than Ever, Crypto Represents a Port in the StormThough U.S. markets may seem a bit erratic, the global economy is teetering on the brink of another recession. Citizens in the European Union and other countries around the world such as Japan, with negative interest rates are actually paying banks to hold their money and lock-in their losses rather than watch their wealth wither away.Dovish monetary policy from banks around the world, such as quantitative easing programs and further interest rate reductions may prevent a global recession, but they are unlikely to lead to create a thriving global economy. At least in the near term.Although bitcoin, ether, and other forms of crypto have some correlation to global markets, they represent the building blocks of a new global economy and model of wealth creation that is decoupled from central banks and monolithic companies.This suggests that they will clear their own path, one which is more equitable and transparent than the world in which we live today.To 2020 and BeyondEven though crypto has been around for 10 years, it is fair to say that we are still in the second inning. Or as Winston Churchill once put it, “Now this is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning.”The industry is recovering from the 2018 bear market, and trends are looking up.Happy Thanksgiving!"

This year, members of the cryptocurrency community are participating in #BitcoinTuesday, a coordinated effort led by The Giving Block to promote crypto giving on Giving Tuesday. The lead sponsor is Brave, along with Gemini, Splunk, Inca Digital Securities, Bottlepay, Cointracker, and Node40. It is anticipated that this initiative will lead to a groundswell of crypto donations.Some of the largest nonprofit organizations in the world like United Way and The Red Cross accept bitcoin donations, and have been doing so for several years. Unicef recently announced its cryptocurrency fund, enabling the United Nations children’s agency to “receive, hold and disburse donations of ether and bitcoin,” according to the agency’s web site. In 2018, contributions to Fidelity Charitable in cryptocurrency totaled $30 million for 2018, and surpassed $100 million since the program’s inception in 2015. But what about other nonprofit organizations? According to the latest Global Trends in Giving Report (from 2018), only 2% of nonprofit organizations in the U.S., Canada and Europe accept crypto donations. That percentage is a little higher in Africa (5%) and Asia (4%).With a market cap for the top 10 cryptocurrencies that exceeds $180 billion, one might wonder why more nonprofit organizations don’t diversify their appeal to attract crypto donations (especially from younger donors!). Pat Duffy, co-founder of The Giving Block, an organization that equips nonprofit organizations to accept several cryptocurrencies explains that the reason for this is two-fold. “First, to many nonprofit professionals, accepting cryptocurrency is daunting. They don’t know how to get started, and they’re afraid of doing it the wrong way. Second, they don’t recognize the tremendous potential which is in the hundreds of millions each year.” The Giving Block offers peace of mind to nonprofits that want to take advantage of the nascent asset class that only arrived with the introduction of bitcoin. Duffy started the organization with co-founder Alex Wilson, based on their belief that cryptocurrency donations could transform the world of philanthropy. ""An entirely new donor demographic needs to be messaged effectively, and provided with ways to give that are the most tax incentivized, convenient, and exciting,"" said Wilson.Duffy and Wilson are currently working with nearly 50 nonprofit organizations to help them connect with the crypto community; the demand for this niche service continues to grow. Guiding such well known nonprofits as Save the Children, Heifer International and No Kid Hungry, they are off to a good start. The Giving Block utilizes the Gemini cryptocurrency exchange to enable nonprofits to accept Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, Litecoin, Zcash, and the Gemini Dollar. It offers participating nonprofits an “auto-sell” option through which cryptocurrency donations are converted to cash instantly upon receipt, eliminating the hassle of having to sell the crypto and concerns about volatility. This is a big deal because nonprofits are empowered to access a whole new community of donors with strong financial incentives to donate crypto. The Giving Block platform eliminates the risk associated with holding cryptocurrency which can deter nonprofits from seeking crypto donations in the first place. In addition to creating the infrastructure for crypto donations, the Giving Block offers nonprofits an online and in-person philanthropic community to connect with cryptocurrency donors and corporate partners. Suzanne Pelletier, Executive Director, Rainforest Foundation US started working with The Giving Block to raise awareness for her organization. Frustrated with the scale and pace of traditional fundraising strategies, she turned to The Giving Block for assistance. “They developed a campaign for us called #CryptoFirefighter,” she explained. “They pushed the campaign to the crypto community and broadened our reach.” Although Rainforest Foundation US had been accepting bitcoin for several years on their own, they are now turning to The Giving Block for crypto donations. Pelletier explains that the Giving Block platform makes it easy for donors receive tax receipts automatically. “The platform also has an option that allows us to automatically exchange donated crypto for US dollars, which is a big advantage. It’s much more efficient” she said. Aside from altruistic reasons, there are practical reasons for donating cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrencies are classified as property by the IRS, just like stocks. That means that cryptocurrency donors don't pay capital gains tax on the appreciated crypto, so long as they’ve held it for more than a year. The bigger the donations, the bigger the write offs for the donor. This is particularly relevant given the wild swings in the price of cryptocurrencies. Mahnaz Javid is president and CEO of the Mona Foundation, a nonprofit that supports educating children in need and empowering girls and women to transform their communities. She explains that because so many crypto currencies have appreciated, “there is a real opportunity for crypto owners to do good by donating their crypto to nonprofits.” The Mona Foundation was the recipient of a $1,000,000 Bitcoin grant from Pineapple Fund, and they now accept other cryptocurrencies through The Giving Block. According to Javid, the Giving Block is helping them to “galvanize the crypto community.” Rainn Wilson, best known for playing the character Dwight in the television show, The Office, is an important advocate for the Mona Foundation. He tweeted out a video imploring crypto owners to donate their crypto to the Mona Foundation. Currently, donors wishing to donate crypto other than bitcoin may be unable to take advantage of possible tax benefits. This is because if donors convert their crypto to bitcoin when they donate, they lose any tax benefit to which they might have been entitled. Duffy offers that although there are plenty of options for a nonprofit organization to accept bitcoin, very few of them enable organizations to accept other cryptocurrencies. This is what makes The Giving Block optimal, Duffy explains, “our platform provides the solution.”"

(Photo Illustration by Avishek Das/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images),"A sell-off, which took Bitcoin below the key support level of $8700, dragged down other major currencies last week.As of Saturday evening, Bitcoin had lost 3.14% of its value over the last seven days.That’s on top of 5.75% it lost in the previous seven days.XRP had lost 5.50% of its value over the same period, on top of the 5.77% it lost in the previous seven-day period.Meanwhile, ETH, LTC and XLM gave back some of the gains they made in the previous weeks.The sell-off in major cryptocurrencies extended to the broader market, with 46 out of the top 100 cryptocurrencies advancing and 54 declining.Still, that was an improvement from the previous week, when 39 out of the top 100 cryptocurrencies advanced and 61 declined.And that may be a sign that the sell-off is slowing down rather than accelerating.""Currently Bitcoin appears to be struggling to stay above its support, however it is showing some bullish divergences so I'd expect a rally in the short term,” Nick Pelecanos, Advisor to NEM Ventures, said on Friday morning. What does it mean for traders? “In terms of a trading plan, nothing has changed since last week,” he says.“Those taking short positions are expecting the break of support and a roughly 20% fall, while long positions are awaiting the break of Ichimoku resistance.”Why? Because, “BTC doesn't remain sideways for very long, so provided the supply doesn't break on Friday evening or over the weekend I'm expecting an increase in volatility heading into next week.”Wayne Chen, CEO of Interlapse Technologies, agrees. “Bitcoin will continue to have its swings as we move towards the end of 2019,” he says. “The entire market has been showing more activity, but I think the price will continue dancing up and down.” Pelecanos sees the prospect for strong moves in next week, as he keeps an eye on the Alt market.  “The sideways action of BTC has made room for some strong alt moves this week,” he says. “I'll be continuing to watch the Alt market closely for trading opportunities next week or until BTC makes a greater move.”He’s also following Ethereum closely. “I'm expecting Ethereum to begin outpacing BTC coming into January 2020 as investors look to secure their minimum 32 Eth for staking. However, I don't expect the proper ETH2.0 with sharding to be released until sometime in 2021 so I am viewing this as a possible 'buy the rumor sell the fact' play."" Chen has a positive roundup for Bitcoin for 2019. “Bitcoin has performed very well in 2019,” he says. “Even though price didn’t hit all-time highs, 2019 generated the highest volume, which is showing growth in Bitcoin adoption. There were many positive developments in 2019 that provided more avenues for new investors into Bitcoin.” And he is positive for 2020, with an eye on halvening, next May. “We can expect some big price fluctuations in early 2020 until the Bitcoin halvening event in May,” he says. “After the halvening, Bitcoin should be bullish and have significant price climbs when compared to historic halvening events. It will be a much more interesting year!” "

After that project, as he browsed the internet, he came across the Bitcoin white paper on slashdot, a social news website for nerds. “I was super excited,” said McCaleb. “I didn't think it was possible to solve [the double-spend] problem before I read the white paper. It was super interesting to me and, about two weeks later, I had made the Mt. Gox exchange, because at the time there wasn't really a good way to buy or sell bitcoin, and I wanted to experiment with the technology to learn the system.” In an effort to better understand the Bitcoin technology, McCaleb decided to make a Bitcoin application. Ultimately, running an exchange did not interest McCaleb, so he began searching for suitors to take the exchange over, deciding upon Mark Karpeles. McCaleb recalled that process, which took place at a time when Bitcoin wasn’t the cultural phenomenon it is today. He had made Mt. Gox as a hobby, and people were using it. Running an exchange long term was not what he was interested in. He started looking for someone to take it over.“The Bitcoin world back then was much, much different than it is today,” he said. “When I joined BitcoinTalk, which is where everyone that knew about Bitcoin had an account, there were about 2,000 people. By the time I gave Mt. Gox to Mark, there were like 5,000, 10,000 people––something like that.” He came across Karpeles through that community. Mark seemed like he could handle the responsibility. “Obviously, he was incompetent it turned out,” said McCaleb, noting he has never actually met Karpeles.He got to work on his next project. The Stellar founder always thought Bitcoin was an awesome idea, but has been bothered by the mining aspect.  “If you can solve the consensus algorithm without mining, obviously that's a better situation, because literally billions of dollars are spent on mining,” he said. “People don't really realize how it's a huge drain on the Bitcoin economy, essentially, because all that money has to flow out every year to pay for electricity, the people who work on these things, and this is a big drag on the system –– environmental concerns aside.” Jed McCaleb and Michael Terpin discuss the Jed McCaleb's journey through blockchain and Stellar. Before Bitcoin, McCaleb thought there was no solution to the consensus problem Bitcoin set out to solve. “Bitcoin inspired me like some other people to start thinking about other ways you can solve this consensus issue, which is really what mining is about,” McCaleb said. “I came up with the idea that led to Ripple, then along the way we realized there's a lot of other things you can do with a network, not just a digital token.” He realized you could do things such as represent other kinds of value, like in the form of digital fiat currencies as demonstrated by stablecoins and decentralized exchanges. McCaleb, however, didn’t set out to solve the consensus problem the same way as Bitcoin. “Bitcoin is obviously extremely decentralized, and there's no central company driving it forward,” said McCaleb, “and that's a really awesome model, but it's very hard to replicate. There is some middle ground between that and just like a fully centralized Uber-type thing where there's a company that is helping to get the network started and then you kind of step back and let the thing run once it reaches a certain level of maturity.”Instead of depending entirely on an open-source community, Stellar raised money to build a team, which led to them raising money from the likes of Stripe and PayPal executives. Mr. Terpin noted how Stellar was one of the most successful projects at building a community. The topic of airdrops, an often used strategy in the blockchain industry to distribute tokens to individuals, was breached more than once during the thirty minute discussion. Despite Stellar’s aggressive airdrop strategy, which they’ve recently backed down from, McCaleb admits that Stellar, and the industry as a whole, has yet to overcome the difficulty of creating network effect. This is one of the problems of crypto in general, he said. “I don’t think any [projects] have really done it yet, especially for payments, you need both sides of it,” he said. “And, this is why things aren't actually used yet. This is one reason why everyone was really into it, but it's not being used in the world, because we don't have a big enough network between like between people holding it and people that are accepting it. So, how do you get that flywheel started? It's a hard problem to solve.”Terpin asked if Stellar, which enjoyed a lot of early backers including Stripe, had any plans for a separate fund a la NEO’s New Economic Entrepreneur’s Fund, the EOS Blockchain Venture Capital Company, and Cardano’s EMURGO fund. “We don't have that today,” said McCaleb. “We've given out grants to various companies, but never for operations. We are debating internally now whether we should go that route and set something up like that. I don’t think we’d do it in the same ways that these other funds are setup, but we might.”"

It included stocks — led by low-volatility bond proxies and high-valuation growth companies — Treasuries, gold, and of course, bitcoin, up 275% at one point.Bitcoin picked up steam earlier than gold, after a massive buyer rallied the price back above $4,000 in early April. This was almost precisely when stock market volatility as measured by the VIX finally receded back to mid-2018 levels below 13. Just like how bitcoin's epic 2017 rally preceded the frothiest, most expensive S&P 500 market top we've seen in this recovery, bitcoin once again gained steam at the onset of a period of intense risk-on activity in markets.But then it started crashing in the summer, even as stocks and other risk-on assets continued their run. Why? Because the best way to consider bitcoin is as a highly speculative gamble on its future use as a store of value. For some, especially those who rode the bandwagon in 2017, bitcoin was little more than a roulette wheel. But for most others, it is best thought of as an incredibly far out-of-the-money call option on bitcoin's path to adoption, to borrow a phrase from my friends at Delphi Digital. Because of this, it has traded both as a speculative asset and a store of value.Viewed through the SOV lens, bitcoin’s 2019 run makes a ton of sense. It was a response to improvement in the underlying probability that the bullish bitcoin event-series would occur: negative-yielding assets were on the rise, the Fed reversed course, and trade wars were heading to currency wars. As this backdrop fell into place, bitcoin and gold traded closely in sync, with the 30-day correlation between bitcoin and gold futures reaching a record high of 0.91 in mid-July. It's not a coincidence.Close your eyes and listen to an interview with a gold bug. Then listen to one with a cryptoknight. You really can't tell the difference. Open your eyes, and if you see the person has a tie on, they're a gold bug. That's basically it.But here's the kicker: in 2019, swapping ""gold"" with ""bonds"" yields little difference in the justification for owning each asset, and the two have traded at a very tight correlation for much of the year. Bonds, gold, and bitcoin all rallied because they all offered a way to capitalize on central bank extravagance and increasingly low interest rates; they just appeal to three different types of investors. And with bitcoin offering the least likely path to success — but biggest reward if it is widely adopted — it became the highest beta version of the safe haven trades.When I bring this idea up to analysts or portfolio managers on my shows, they usually laugh it off. Traditional investors recoil at the notion that bitcoin has macroeconomic tie-ins, because the implication is that their precious Treasury market is probably in a bit of a bubble too. Characteristic of the current polarized environment, few seem capable of holding a nuanced view on the asset class.But for those who do, it is arguably the best leading indicator for where safe-haven trades go next. Right now, that means more downside in King Crypto suggests more downside for bonds and gold. And if it's a major plunge like last year, that's likely also to show up in risk assets like stocks."

This branch of the major Investment company has now been granted a license by New York's financial regulator.The license allows the company to offer its cryptocurrency trading and custody services to companies based in the State, something that has not been easy to do in the past. New York and its notorious BitLicense, the common term used for a business license of virtual currency activities, issued in the State, have caused many crypto-focused businesses to look elsewhere.However, this has left a rather large gap in a prime market for cryptocurrency businesses. The issue is that the regulations in New York surrounding cryptocurrency activities have set a high benchmark that many smaller companies struggle with. In fact, when the BitLicense decision came into play in 2015, there was an exodus of businesses that was labeled the 'Great Bitcoin Exodus' by the New York Business Journal. Chasing demandFor Fidelity Digital Assets, the aim of achieving this license in New York was to meet the high demand for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in the State.""We have experienced a high interest level from these firms and anticipate that their increased involvement in this industry would enable more activities and development across the spectrum,"" the company said in a blog post.The demand is growing and evolving in the cryptocurrency ecosystem; no longer is it speculating individual investors, but rather institutions and enterprises. ""The custody and trade execution services that we provide are essential building blocks for institutional investors' continued adoption of digital assets,"" said Michael O'Reilly, CEO of Fidelity Digital Assets. ""The designation as a New York Trust Company under the supervision and examination of the DFS builds on the credibility and trust we're establishing amongst institutions and other market participants.

During the crypto bubble they were popping up everywhere.Now they are dying away.Hardly a week goes by without another exchange pulling the plug. Recently it was CoinExchange.io.The reason is not too complicated; many of the flashy coin projects that spewed into the crypto space in 2016 are dead and have no reason to trade or for that matter to exist at all. The exchanges have little business to sustain the cost of staying open.The world doesn’t need another bitcoin. Well it probably does, but it doesn’t need another 2,000. There are lots of cryptocurrencies out there but when you strip the Ethereum tokens out of that universe, there are left perhaps 30 cryptocurrencies of a scale that would be considered listable were they a stock. At most, there are 150 relevant distributed cryptocurrencies.This does not make for an ecosystem with more exchanges than there are listed coins.The regulatory walls are also closing in on these upstart exchanges. It is obvious to anyone but a fool that it doesn’t take much to get a cryptocurrency exchange owner busted at a U.S. airport for breaking all sorts of nasty local U.S. laws. Local rules in many countries are also no cakewalk. Many of the closing exchanges are simply too afraid to continue trading under ever-increasing regulatory pressure, meaning there will be an ongoing shrinkage in the exchange space for a fairly long time to come.Happily, cryptocurrency exchanges are not going away. There are already enough big exchanges to deal with the needs of the “industry” for a long time to come.The same goes for altcoins.Coins that do the job of bitcoin must have a limited appeal. There is room for a few dozen doing the job of bitcoin, in the same way as there is room for the yen, dollar, yuan and euro but not so much for the like of the reis, ruble and rupee, and less so for any of the other hundred or more “fiat” that are mainly local currencies.What cryptocurrencies need is a “use case.” The world is full of para-currencies, stores are full of gift cards for a start. The trick is that those instruments have a use case. The points do something specific or rather enable something specific to be done. That something means those currencies can and will circulate.Many online games have para-currencies and that’s fine by all, as long as there is no easy way to swap then for money. That is when government gets nervous, because that is when private currency provides end runs around all sorts of laws.The modern world is full of systems that track points that equal money, but the breakthrough thing about the “crypto” element added to this established way of doing things is that the overhead of all that bookkeeping and the need to trust the central party with your “store of wealth” disappears.Tokens that suddenly become worthless is a tale that goes far back into time. IOUs get debased and shredded as far back as recorded history. Money, even physical money like gold and silver, are never stable in value. Gold and silver have, for example, gone from a ratio of value of 5 to 1 in the ancient world, to the current 60 to 1 in the modern period. Silver is now much easier to produce than gold and is a common byproduct. As such it has repriced.Up to now the use cases of money were powerful, a store of wealth, a unit of account and a means of exchange, but apart from a few niche applications, like jewelry, decoration and votive offerings, that’s all there is.Crypto can be more.If you go down to the river Thames in London at low tide you may find lead tokens from pubs doing business in the 17th-18th Century. This was “beer money” that pubs would issue to break up an official coin whose value was multiple flagons of ale, not the single pint the customer wanted to buy there and then.This money traveled up and down the river banks because other pubs would accept it as a valued currency because they could run it up the road to the issuing pub and cash it out in official coinage.It was purely a failure of government that meant the tokens were necessary. In general, people prefer to trust official sources for their money. It is only when there is not enough money around or the money in circulation is inferior or degraded in some way, that people will put their trust in alternative assets rather than sock away the official currency of their society.This might be a good argument for why cryptocurrency does not have a future, because governments can create their own cryptocurrencies and make the current private sector ones unnecessary.They could, but they won’t because when you look at what government does, they always eventually run off with all the society’s money one way or another and the crypto element in cryptocurrency makes that probability, impossible.It is not without reason that the countries that manipulate their money the most are the ones where crypto is most frowned upon and conversely it is to be expected that the countries with the best run economies are the most laid back about the private sector sneaking onto their financial turf.As such, bitcoin and the mineable decentralized altcoins will always have a place, if only, like gold coins, as a way of hedging the owner from disaster and privation. As coins with new use cases appear so will the benefits of blockchain technology grow.––Clem Chambers is the CEO of private investors website ADVFN.com and author of Be Rich, The Game in Wall Street and Trading Cryptocurrencies: A Beginner’s Guide.

[+] competition for more traditional cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. ","Over the last decade, thousands of digital currencies have come into existence. While this rapid proliferation has helped illustrate the enthusiasm and innovative nature of cryptocurrency advocates, one can’t help but wonder how many of these projects will survive in the long-term. Earlier this month, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse told Bloomberg that 99% of all digital assets will “probably” go “to zero.” He is not alone, as Jake Yocom-Piatt, project lead for Decred, has predicted that “many cryptocurrencies will perish.” [Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.]This struggle for survival has grown even more intense, as many central banks have jumped into the fold, moving to create their own digital currencies. Central Bank Race“At the moment the three biggest currencies in the world are racing to make their fiat digital,” noted Mati Greenspan, senior analyst for eToro. “So far, China is winning and set to announce the PBOC blockchain and digital Yuan early next year,” he emphasized. The central banks behind the other two largest currencies, the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank, have failed to generate as much progress, noted Greenspan. LibraAnother player in the game is libra, a digital currency proposed by The Libra Association. So far, the association, which aims to create a global digital currency and offer financial services to billions who are unbanked, has encountered significant challenges. Several would-be members of The Libra Association cut ties with the project, and regulators have responded with significant skepticism. The OutcomeAs for how this struggle for dominance will pan out, analysts offered varying points of view. While the vast majority of digital currency projects might fail, market observers provided a consensus that this won’t produce a winner-take-all scenario. “Between cryptocoins, corporate coins & state coins, we’re probably not going to end up with 100+ widely used digital currencies,” said Jacob Eliosoff, a cryptocurrency fund manager. “Network effects will matter & there will probably be only a few winners,” he emphasized. Marouane Garcon, managing director of crypto-to-crypto derivatives platform Amulet, offered a similar point of view. “There won’t be a single currency because of too many political differences in the world, but just like fiat currencies some will be stronger in value than others.” Yocom-Piatt predicted that many digital currencies people think of as being a store of value (SOV), for example bitcoin and decred, will survive. Benefits Of CompetitionAt the same time, while many cryptocurrencies may die out, this outcome will certainly have its benefits, he claimed. “Instead of a large amount of capital and attention spread across many currencies, we will increasingly see that same capital and attention spread across a smaller number of SOVs, leading to a corresponding increase in their value.”Further, Yocom-Piatt noted that more traditional cryptocurrencies like bitcoin have characteristics that may help them come out on top. Many prefer cryptocurrencies due to their ability to provide their users with privacy. Monero and Zcash, for example, have made substantial progress on this front. Central bank digital currencies, however, “are simply not incentivized to deliver substantive privacy,” noted Yocom-Piatt. Eliosoff also spoke to this, emphasizing that China is working on a digital currency that will enable “monitoring & state control.” Obviously enough, privacy is only one of the benefits provided by digital currencies, as these innovative creations offer many others. While some digital assets “value privacy,” others emphasize transparency, Greenspan emphasized. “Some are built to scale and some are built for security,” he added. “Each has it’s pros and cons according to the needs and values of the developers.”If the vast majority of cryptocurrency projects die out, it could help provide some clarity, by showing which benefits are of greatest value to the market. CBDC BenefitsWhile CBDCs may not be as popular as their more traditional counterparts within the crypto community, these government-issued digital assets certainly have potential. By issuing digital assets that are cryptographically secured, governments might be able to completely eliminate counterfeiting. Further, by issuing a CBDC, a government could potentially trace every single transaction made using the digital asset. Between these two benefits, digital currencies issued by central banks could eliminate a great deal “of illegal activity,” noted Garcon. Past that, CBDCs could potentially assist governments with both “Tax Collection and Money Laundering prevention,” noted Garlam Won, head of marketing for blockchain startup Harmony. By harnessing CBDCs, governments could “accurately assess the health of the economy and [obtain a] detailed view into which sectors might require more funding and support.”Armed with this information, governments might use tax dollars more efficiently, he noted.

Exciting way to spend a Friday evening, right? It sounds like an arcane debate but, as that exchange revealed, the finality promises made by different blockchain platforms are not obvious and they have profound implications for the unwary. Businesses really don’t like transactions that have a chance of being reversed. Transactions that can go from “confirmed” to “unconfirmed” can cause utter chaos. Imagine handing your car keys to a buyer after checking their payment had hit your account, only to discover later that what the bank meant to say was that the money had “probably” arrived and, upon closer examination, they subsequently determined that it hadn’t. You’d probably be quite annoyed. The myth of immutability You may think this set up to an article is an absurd strawman. “Why is Richard inventing a nonsense scenario and then inviting you to agree that it is indeed nonsense? Blockchain transactions are immutable!” Not quite… The strange reality is that transactions on public blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum always have a probability of being reversed, a probability that often decays with time but which is never zero. Their finality is probabilistic. Your transaction is not final straight away, and never will be. And because these blockchains are fully anonymous, you may never know the identity of the parties involved if a reversal happens to you. Now, this phenomenon is a consequence of the censorship-resistant, ‘permissionless’ nature of such platforms. Depending on the scenario, it’s a trade-off many of us are happy to accept. The public Bitcoin and Ethereum networks are modern wonders of the world and their probabilistic finality is just something you accept in return for the other advantages they offer. But you do need to understand that this is how they work if you are to use them safely. For example, some recommendations suggest you wait for as many as 25 confirmations on the Ethereum network to be sure the risk of a double-spend attack is low enough that you probably don’t need to worry about it. This clearly introduces inefficiency and risk – after all, how many businesses in today’s world can sit around and wait for an hour or more for a transaction to be confirmed without any adverse repercussions? The critical importance of finality was highlighted earlier this year when crypto exchange Coinbase halted all Ethereum Classic transactions, withdrawals and deposits, due to a series of blockchain history reorganisations on the network. During the attack, Ethereum Classic (a related but different network to Ethereum) saw more than 100 blocks “reorganised,” leading to 88,500 ETC being double-spent, totalling some $460,000. Ethereum platforms are largely used by individuals, but imagine if this happened to a network used by businesses transacting millions or even billions of dollars each day. The lack of confirmation finality in public blockchains renders their immutability and security guarantees highly problematic in a business context. Transaction history can be rewound, contracts you thought were agreed can become ‘unagreed’ and money double-spent. So the inappropriate application of this type of technology to problems for which it was not designed must be guarded against. Plan for all eventualities So what are we to do if we want the advantages of blockchain technology – determinism, consensus between transacting parties, elimination of discrepancies, cryptographic assurance of data lineage and all the rest – but without also subjecting businesses to risks they can’t evaluate and couldn’t mitigate even if they could? The answer is surprising in its simplicity. We need only remind ourselves why public systems like Bitcoin and Ethereum have probabilistic finality. It is a consequence of their censorship resistance. But businesses don’t need or want censorship resistance! So if we eliminate censorship resistance from our requirements, we can eliminate probabilistic finality from our solutions. We can eliminate the possibility that transactions could become ‘unconfirmed’ as a natural, inevitable, and blameless consequence of a system’s design. Which means we can design systems such that if a transaction ever were reversed it would unambiguously be a fault, for which we could unambiguously assign blame. The right approach to transaction finality for business blockchains is to acknowledge things can go wrong and to plan for them up-front. Accept that you need to know the identity of the consensus providers, and that you need a governance process and dispute resolution forum for problems that cannot be solved solely with clever maths or novel technology. In short, if you’re seeking to reap the benefits of blockchain technology in business, you need to be using a platform where the identity of the consensus providers is known. Where they need permission to provide such a service. To be clear, I’m not claiming that permissioned blockchains are naturally immune to bad things happening. Instead, I’m making the argument that bad things can happen on any platform and so you have to have an answer for what happens if they ever did. The answer in the probabilistic, permissionless world is, in effect, that it’s just a risk you have to take; if a transaction were to be reversed, there would be nobody you could point to blame (or sue!) In a permissioned system, bad things could still happen, but you would know precisely who was to blame. And just as businesses today have a variety of transaction methods at their disposal – cash, credit, financing – blockchain platforms should not try to force a square peg into a round hole by making all businesses use the same consensus mechanism. After all, the needs of a closely-knit trading network in London might be very different to those of a deeply untrusting network of trading partners in a complex supply chain. For example, Bitcoin has a need for censorship resistance and uses an algorithm called “Proof of Work” to achieve this by enabling an arbitrary number of anonymous parties to participate in the consensus process. In the event of a transaction reversal (as can happen during a “blockchain reorganisation”), you have no way of knowing if it happened as a natural consequence of the technology or because of an attack. Some other platforms are experimenting with a system called “Proof of Stake”. In these systems, you may be able to make more precise assumptions about the cost to pull off an attack. But should one happen, you still have no way of knowing who to blame. To mitigate this, Ethereum’s current planning for their second-generation blockchain includes the possibility that proof of stake finality will take two days. Other firms, including (full disclosure) mine, are pursuing an approach where the consensus providers are not anonymous and where they group together in pools and constantly cross-check each other, where there are clear expectations as to their behaviors, and the consequences should they deviate. This was ultimately the conclusion of the Twitter argument I found myself in: the general consent was that the finality promises of Ethereum as it exists today are indeed unsuitable for business – but maybe a future version will change this, albeit maybe only after two days. I’m grateful to the participants in the debate for the open and positive way in which they engaged in the discussion. It is great to be part of a broader community where we can discuss our differences from a position of mutual respect. In the short but colorful history of enterprise technology, there are very few examples of solutions achieving critical mass that have not been designed specifically for the purpose for which they end up being successfully deployed. Blockchain is no different. Technology providers must listen to the requirements of their user base and build accordingly, not vice versa."

Five years went by, and the next thing the IRS said was that hard forks were taxable. How about swaps of crypto for crypto guidance? Not so much. There is no official guidance, although we all know that by statute, 1031 now applies only to real property. How about for 2017 and prior years? It just isn’t clear if you could claim 1031 exchanges on your 2017 taxes. That is why the world sat up when someone from the IRS said–at a conference–that 1031 didn’t apply even to those old years. Is that official guidance? Not hardly. An IRS person said the IRS view was “no” on 1031 for crypto. Suzanne Sinno, an attorney in the IRS Office of the Associate Chief Counsel, made the remark at an American Institute of CPAs conference November 13, 2019. ","LONDON, ENGLAND - NOVEMBER 20: A visual representation of the cryptocurrencies Bitcoin and Ethereum ... [+] on November 20, 2018 in London, England. Cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple and Litecoin showed unprecedented growth in 2017, growing more than 5000%, with market-leader Bitcoin topping out at nearly 20,000 USD per Bitcoin just before the new year. Since then however, the whole cryptocurrency sector has declined dramatically losing over 80% itÕs value. In recent days, Bitcoin has dropped sharply to new yearly-lows to around 4300 USD at the time of writing. The sector has divided opinions within financial circles with some leading figures claiming itÕs revolutionary effects on the monetary system, whilst others calling it nothing other than a speculative bubble. (Photo by Jordan Mansfield/Getty Images)She worked on the recent cryptocurrency guidance the IRS issued, but this was not an official announcement, nor was it “authority” for federal income tax purposes. Besides, shortly thereafter, another IRS official walked back the earlier comments, saying it depends on the facts. There is no blanket policy to deny 1031 treatment. Do these “announcements” mean the IRS might push back in an audit? Sure, but didn’t we already know that? Yes, particularly given the wild differences in how taxpayers treated—and reported—their crypto trades. The recent IRS reveals are interesting, but to say one cannot claim 1031 treatment for 2017 is overblown. Section 1031 provides that neither gain nor loss is recognized on an exchange of like-kind property that is used in a trade or business or held for investment. However, Section 1031 does not apply to “stocks, bonds … notes, [or] other securities or evidences of indebtedness or interest.” According to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, “the distinction intended and made by the statute is the broad one between classes and characters of property, for instance, between real and personal property.” Commissioner v. Crichton, 122 F.2d 181, 182 (5th Cir. 1941), aff’g 42 B.T.A. 490 (1940). This language suggests that a liberal test should be used to determine if two types of property are “like kind.” The IRS at times has taken a narrower interpretation in analyzing exchanges of tangible property. For instance, in Revenue Ruling 79-143, the IRS ruled that numismatic coins and bullion-type coins were not “like kind” properties. The IRS noted that numismatic coins may be valued for their condition, age, or beauty in addition to their gold content, whereas bullion coins are valued based on the price of gold.Similarly, IRS General Counsel Memorandum 38899 explained that gold bullion held for investment was not “like kind” with silver bullion held for investment. The GCM states that gold and silver are different metals, and are used in different ways (gold for investment; silver as an industrial commodity). The GCM emphasizes that a taxpayer who exchanges gold bullion for silver bullion “is not in essentially the same economic situation after the exchange as he or she was in before the exchange.” The IRS could argue that, like gold and silver bullion, cryptocurrencies are subject to different market forces, and are different investments used in different ways. However, in announcing in 2014 that all digital currencies are property, the IRS seemed to indicate they were essentially similar. Other authorities suggest that when it comes to intangibles—such as cryptocurrency seems to be—investments do not need to be subject to identical market forces to qualify for like-kind treatment. For example, in Technical Advice Memorandum 200035005, the IRS surveyed its own Revenue Rulings on like-kind treatment, including the bullion exchange authorities. The IRS noted that “even the narrowest interpretation of the like kind standard does not require that one property be identical to another or that they be completely interchangeable.” The IRS concluded that a taxpayer’s exchange of FCC radio licenses for an FCC television license qualified as a like-kind exchange under Section 1031. The TAM said “the differences in the assigned frequencies are not differences in nature or character, but are merely differences in grade or quality.” This seems significant, because radio and television licenses are arguably not subject to identical market forces. One might even argue that the differences between an FCC radio license and an FCC television license are much more significant than the relatively subtle technical differences between a number of types of cryptocurrencies. The differences between many cryptocurrencies are arguably not differences in “nature and character.” There are arguably more similarities than differences, and some of the historical Section 1031 authorities seem pretty helpful. IRS rulings indicate that a broader application of the like-kind standard is appropriate for intangible property. For example, in Revenue Ruling 67-380, the IRS held that exchanges of baseball player contracts qualified for “like kind” exchange treatment.  The IRS also issued informal guidance that exchanges of fishing permits are allowed under Section 1031, “regardless of whether the permit is for a different fishery, a different species of fish, or a different type of fishing gear.” IRS, Fishing Audit Technique Guide (August 2011). IRS regulations even say that a copyright in a novel can be like-kind to a copyright in a different novel. The IRS might argue that cryptocurrencies are not eligible for like-kind exchange treatment because Section 1031 does not apply to exchanges of “securities.” Whether cryptocurrencies are securities for securities law purposes has been hotly debated. A topic that has not had as much attention is whether cryptocurrencies are securities for tax law purposes, including Section 1031. Skeptics might argue that Congress did not intend for Section 1031 to apply to liquid investments. Because cryptocurrencies can be traded on exchanges much like stocks and bonds, perhaps they should be treated as securities for Section 1031 purposes? However, the IRS’s analysis of Section 1031’s application to another novel investment product might help.In the 1960’s and 1970’s, the IRS considered whether whiskey warehouse receipts (“WWRs”) should be treated as securities for Section 1031 purposes. A whisky warehouse receipt represents a share in a quantity of whisky being aged for future sale. Beginning in the early 1900’s, whisky warehouse receipts were sometimes advertised as a risk-free get-rich-quick scheme to investors. They eventually became regulated by the SEC as securities. WWRs and cryptocurrencies seem similar in some ways. The IRS made a preliminary decision not to treat WWRs as securities for Section 1031, and proposed publicizing that decision in a ruling. The IRS said “none of the various Code sections containing definitions of the term ‘securities’ includes warehouse receipts.” Notably, the IRS said that treating WWRs as securities could be viewed as consistent with Congress’ purposes of excluding securities from Section 1031 treatment. The IRS indicated that such treatment might be consistent because of the potential classification by the SEC or state securities regulators of WWRs as securities for securities law purposes. The SEC even told the IRS that if the IRS said WWRs were not securities for purposes of Section 1031, it could jeopardize the SEC’s position in ongoing litigation that WWRs were subject to its enforcement jurisdiction. Despite the SEC’s plea, the IRS stuck to its conclusion that WWRs were not securities for purposes of Section 1031. Yes, that means 1031 swaps were OK. The IRS pointed out that the definition of “securities” for revenue purposes should be given a narrower meaning than the definition of that term for securities law purposes. The latter involves the exercise of police power to protect the public. Still, to avoid undercutting the SEC’s enforcement efforts, the IRS ultimately decided not to publish its proposed WWR ruling.Would the IRS agree with any of this? Perhaps not. But even if the IRS pushes back, they might listen. After all, it is not clear whether the IRS official who mentioned the unpublished “IRS position” on 1031 has communicated any of this to all the thousands of IRS troops out there. Besides, even if the IRS won’t listen in an audit, there is always IRS appeals. The IRS Appeals Office is where many tax disputes end up being compromised. The IRS isn’t even the last word. The courts are. And if your stakes are big enough, that might be worth the effort. "

Last week, ShapeShift, founded in 2014, launched an integration with the software wallet from Portis, enabling users to more easily hold their private keys with an internet browser sans the need for hardware. “The old ShapeShift was a tool for self-custody, so that people would hold their own assets in their own wallets and trade on ShapeShift as they pleased without having to hold funds at a centralized exchange,” Erik Voorhees, ShapeShift Founder and CEO, tells Forbes.com. “The new version of ShapeShift is a full self-custody platform for crypto management.”The company released the Portis integration last week, as the software wallet represented an important complement to zero commission trading, making it easily accessible to more people. The company will soon launch support for Ledger, a french start-up which creates cryptocurrency wallets for individuals and businesses.“[Users] don't need to worry about some third-party holding their funds anymore, and they can trade at great rates with a great user interface,” says Voorhees. “They can see their portfolio amounts, they can buy and sell with fiat. They can trade between different crypto assets, and they can do all that through a normal web browser quickly and easily.”He adds: “User experience is what we're focused on. This is the future of ShapeShift that we were building towards. We just think it’s a smarter way to handle crypto long-term.”Voorhees doesn’t believe there is a material difference between a cryptocurrency ecosystem in which everyone is trusting a counter-party to hold their money and the current banking model. “The entire essence of why crypto is cool is because it allows people to take full ownership and control of their own assets,” he said, admitting there is a little bit of a learning curve to make self-custody a reality as people learn this new behavior. “But the whole point of crypto is to give people that sovereignty over their assets. That's the future we're building toward. And, that doesn't mean that everyone will always self-custody everything, but we think that it's very important that there be very robust, highly usable systems for normal people who want self-custody and control over their own financial future.” A screenshot of the ShapeShift website.Voorhees believes it's crucial to move people away from custodial exchanges and into either decentralized or self-custody models. “Our whole mission for the last five years has been to get people away from centralized exchanges, which has been a total uphill battle because people don't like changing their behaviors,” he said. The FOX Token ShapeShift’s move into free trading is paired with the release of the FOX token, both launched today. Each FOX token is worth $10 of zero commission trading volume on a rolling 30-day basis (and it renews every month). If you have a hundred FOX tokens, you can trade up to a thousand dollars a month sans commissions. “You can think of the token as a key that unlocks the ability to do this,” said Voorhees. “We think that'll be a much more compelling and powerful model over the long term than trying to charge fees on each trade.” Voorhees is a “huge fan” of people experimenting with different digital assets and tokens. He says that during the bull market in 2017, when many entrepreneurs released doltish tokens for software that didn’t exist, many were left with a bad taste for tokens in their mouths.  “It caused many people to overlook how powerful some of these tokenized assets can actually be.”When arriving at a use-case for what would become the FOX token, which functions like a loyalty token, the company put themselves in the shoes of the customer. They asked: “If a customer had a token that we created, what would they want it to do?”ShapeShift pondered thereupon, and spoke with some of their customers, asking them what things they would like a token to do. “Pretty unanimously, the responses revolved around pricing,” said Voorhees, who said the team had been casually discussing commission-free trading for two years, and planning the execution thereof for the last two months. “That's what led us down this path of to zero commission, and allowing anyone to access that as long as they have the token.” Voorhees and the ShapeShift team saw an opportunity to incorporate a token on their platform that acted as a powerful new mechanism for customer engagement. Anyone who signs up for a ShapeShift account currently receives one hundred free FOX tokens. “There's no signup cost to them, there's no subscription agreement,” said Voorhees. “People who want to do higher amounts need to procure the tokens in other ways. We reward people for certain actions that they do on the site. Right now, if you do trades, you actually get some FOX tokens back on each trade you're doing.”Voorhees hopes people love this new model, that it saves people money, and it also demonstrates how tokens can be responsibly used in an already established business. He added: “If someone wants zero commissions and to maintain control of their keys, ShapeShift is really the only game in town, at this point.” Zero Commission Trading As A Means to Self-CustodyIn order to do their part to encourage self-custody, Voorhees felt ShapeShift needed a strong marketing campaign based around something people would immediately understand. “They might only understand the value of self-custody later or with their own advancement in understanding crypto,” Voorhees says. “So, the move to free trading is really one about marketing messaging and changing our model such that we can pull people away from custodial exchanges and into something that is much safer for them long-term.” In the long run, Voorhees sees people holding many of their assets themselves, and choosing how to put them to good use. “Through smart contracts, they can basically lend these things out to people who are borrowing them,” he said. “This is what banks do and banks like to make a lot of money doing this.” Instead of going to banks, that flow of revenue can go to the people who took the time to learn about self-custodying their digital assets. People will be able to loan out bitcoin, but even tokenized game assets, such as a special tokenized sword, for example, when someone needs to go on an in-game dungeon crawl, a type of video game popular because of its simplicity to make. “From serious financial instruments to things that are basically toys, people would earn a little bit of money from lending out that asset,” he said. “That whole emergence of those lending markets is going to become a massive phenomenon. We're not there yet, but the first bits of that are certainly happening.”When Voorhees entered the Bitcoin industry in 2011, self-custody was different than today. “You set up a full node of Bitcoin and you ran a full node on your computer,” he said. “And ever since then, the user experience of self-custody has gotten better and better.”ShapeShift, which heretofore charged an exchange rate of 0.5% (50 basis points) on trades, sees itself as part of the movement to make  the user experience smooth, easy, understandable, and safe. “So that self custody isn't a scary thing,” said Voorhees, who refers to third-party custodians as a liability the industry has yet to be solved. Traders on ShapeShift will enjoy rates as good or better than main order book exchange alternatives.  In the future, ShapeShift plans a referral program and further digital financial integrations into its self-custody platform. Beyond trading, the FOX token can also incentivize people to test out new or experimental features. Voorhees says part of why people aren’t storing their own digital assets is due to habit, as people have historically held their assets with a third-party. “But, part of why it hasn't been solved is that noncustodial options have been expensive compared to trading on a normal order book exchange, ShapeShift included. We want to change that with this new zero-commission model.” "

[+] waits to testify on bitcoin in front of the Senate in February 2018. ","In what could be a death rattle for the once-hegemonic London interbank offered rate (Libor), a competing index backed by two American companies today announced it would be using the ethereum blockchain.Libor is a benchmark interest rate controlled by global banks including Barclays, Deutsche Bank, Royal Bank of Scotland and UBS that determines the cost for banks to lend money to each other. Ameribor is an alternative backed by the American Financial Exchange (AFX) and Cboe Futures and will use a permissioned version of ethereum and two tokens to do the same thing.While the financial institutions behind Libor have been early leaders in exploring blockchain, they have been slow to implement the technology, which some believe could make some of their services unnecessary by directly connecting counterparties in trades. But the Ameribor use of ethereum shows one early instance of how a product previously provided by a group of banks is now being offered by upstarts and startups.“We learned a great deal about this new and exciting technology and believe the blockchain has the potential to transform electronic trading and financial markets,” said AFX CEO Richard Sandor in a statement. “AFX is committed to remain in the forefront of this new technology.”AFX was founded in 2015 and now has 150 members, and Cboe Futures is a part of the legacy Cboe Global Markets, founded in 1973 as the Chicago Board Options Exchange. The organizations’ Ameribor index was announced earlier this year, and quietly began trading using traditional technology in August. Previously, Sandor helped create some of the first derivatives on U.S. Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities, and in 2003 he founded the Chicago Climate Exchange for trading greenhouse gas emission credits, both of which represent industries that have been targeted for possible disruption using blockchain.In the case of Ameribor, AFX will mint two non-fungible tokens for each party in a transaction. Unlike bitcoin, which is fungible, meaning every token is the same, these non-fungible tokens, compliant with the ERC-721 token standard, contain information about the transaction and the counterparty. The tokens are automatically minted by the AFX Blockchain when a transaction begins, and using the parity smart contract language are automatically settled when the transaction ends. Unlike transactions on the public ethereum blockchain, which reach consensus through a process called proof-of-work that anyone can participate in, the AFX Blockchain uses proof-of-authority, meaning that while the tokens will be compatible with the public blockchain, AFX maintains a degree of control over the transactions.In September 2019, former CFTC chairman Chris Giancarlo—a.k.a. Crypto Dad—joined the AFX board of directors. Giancarlo tells Forbes that while he agrees that Libor needs to be phased out, he doesn’t think a single index should replace it. Between 2012 and 2015 billions of dollars in fines and settlements were levied against the Libor banks who manipulated the rate to their benefit. Now, in addition to AFX’s work with Ameribor, Giancarlo says a number of specialized alternatives are rushing to meet the demand for trust-worthy, transparent alternatives.According to Giancarlo, while the new secured overnight financing rate SOFR benchmark published by the New York Federal Reserve works well as a Libor alternative for big banks that have large holdings of treasuries and other securities to pledge in the repo market, Ameribor is better for small and regional banks that don't have those holdings.  The U.K. regulator that oversees Libor says it will end by 2021.“I really believe that Ameribor is actually very complementary to SOFR,” says Giancarlo, who is also an advisor to the Chamber of Digital Commerce. “So I believe Ameribor is the right thing for America’s medium and small banks, and I really believe in market diversity.”"

Housing stock that would be safe, affordable and accessible would prevent people from having to live in a nursing home when disability sets in (often paid by Medicaid) for lack of available housing.” Lynn told the House committee.Other solutions she has advocated for the long-term-care financial crisis include: incentivizing personal saving for retirement, long-term care services and support insurance, and long-term care; investing in the work-readiness of young people so that the economy is strong and can yield more tax revenue; and standardizing and improving the quality of geriatric medical care.She also advocated enabling communities to drive down the per capita cost of disability in old age and improve reliability and appropriateness of services through local innovation and collaboration.Aging Boomers face the gloom of a shortage in hospice care, National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization President & CEO Edo Banach said during the session. “The number of hospice and palliative care physicians and members of the interdisciplinary team will drop dramatically over the next two decades,” Banach warned. Alzheimer’s Impact Movement executive director Robert Egge noted a study of Medicaid beneficiaries with Alzheimer’s found black/African Americans had significantly higher costs of care than whites or Hispanics primarily due to more inpatient care and medical problems in tandem with dementia.Older black/African Americans are twice as likely to have Alzheimer’s and other dementia as whites, one and a half times that of Hispanics, he said.Right now, the lives of many nursing home and assisted living facility residents are bleak, the Long Term Care Community Coalition executive director Richard Mollot told the House panel.“Avoidable pain, degrading conditions and substandard care are a part of hundreds of thousands of nursing home residents’ lives every day,” Mollot said.Mollot attacked nursing home oversight as harmfully weak, charging violation fines are “relatively a minor expense.”He noted inspectors uncovered repeated violations of the same requirement three or more times over three years in more than 40% of nursing homes.“But less than half of all nursing homes have received any federal fine whatsoever in the last three years and, of those, the average amount is approximately $1,600,” Mallot said.He added while more than 50% of residents in assisted living and nursing homes have some form of dementia or cognitive impairment and 67% of dementia-related deaths occur in nursing homes, many facilities fail to equip their staff with the knowledge and skills necessary to provide comfort and care.The consumer advocate pointed to Illinois state inspectors claiming housekeeping and maintenance services at Alden Town Manor in the Chicago suburbs of Cicero had minimal harm despite finding maggot infestation on a resident’s genital area at the Alden Town Manor.In a June report, the Government Accountability Office said it is imperative that the government agency responsible for ensuring nursing homes protect residents from abuse beef up its oversight.The report said the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services falls short of that responsibility because information on abuse and perpetrator types is not readily available and incidents of abuse reported by nursing homes lack key information.GAO said state agencies that conduct nursing home inspections should immediately report reasonable suspicions of crimes against residents to law enforcement.However, the authors of the study complained those reports often can take weeks or months currently because CMS requires state agencies to tell police or other authorities about abuses only after they are substantiated. “Two (state) Medicaid Fraud Control Units d we interviewed told us the delay in receiving referrals limits their ability to collect evidence and prosecute cases—for example, bedding associated with potential sexual abuse may have been washed, and a victim’s wounds may have healed,” the GAO report said.Close to 1.4 million elderly or disabled individuals reside in more than 15,500 nursing homes nationwide."

fact that attackers typically demand ransoms in bitcoin only adds to ...","Nov 12, 2019,09:15am EST","Ransomware, the IT equivalent of kidnapping, is a huge and growing problem. And ransomware attacks, in which bad actors encrypt organizations’ data to bring IT infrastructure and the associated operations to a standstill, are only becoming more widespread.","Ransomware attacks more than doubled this year. The first quarter of 2019 alone saw a 118% increase in ransomware attacks, and this has created an urgency for organizations to be better prepared to respond to this increasing threat. Dark Reading says ransomware attacks are becoming more targeted, sophisticated, dangerous and disruptive. Europol just published a study saying that ransomware “overwhelmingly retains its position as the top cyber threat faced by European cybercrime investigators.”No Organization, No Matter What Size Or Type, Is ImmuneRansomware is affecting entities of every size and in every vertical. An estimated 140 local governments, hospitals and police stations were held hostage by ransomware attacks in the first 10 months of 2019.Baltimore was paralyzed by attackers who demanded $80,000 in ransom to free the city’s computer systems and files from their grip. The city did not pay the ransom, but it suffered an estimated $18 million in losses.A network of Alabama hospitals this year had to stop accepting new patients due to a ransomware attack. Berry Family Services of Texas was hit with a ransomware attack that barred providers from accessing computer systems and encrypted the data of 1,751 patients. Ransomware also affected police laptops at three Georgia agencies this year.And Ransomware Can Spread Very QuicklyBut Maersk may provide the best example of how fast ransomware can spread. The shipping company was the victim of NotPetya in 2017. The ransomware infected nearly 50,000 endpoints and thousands of applications and servers across 600 locations in 130 countries.An incident involving Norsk Hydro illustrates how ransomware can bring operations to a standstill and ring up significant financial losses. The aluminum company estimated its loss from a ransomware attack this year at $40 million.Bitcoin Payments, Other Costs And Regulatory Considerations Only Add To The ComplexityThe fact that attackers typically demand ransoms in bitcoin only adds to ransomware’s complexity. Such transactions are difficult, perhaps even impossible, to trace.Paying ransoms may put organizations at greater risk of being attacked again. Attackers may attempt additional extortion schemes once they know of an organization’s willingness to pay.Organizations hit by ransomware attacks also need to consider the legal ramifications of paying ransoms. The U.S. government bans financial transactions – including ransom payments – with governments, individuals and organizations on the U.S. sanctions lists.Even when organizations refuse to pay ransoms, ransomware attacks can be costly. The inability to access data or use computers can lead to significant losses due to downtime, and some organizations make big investments in post-attack IT recovery and rebuilding efforts.Organizations Need To Get Better — And Quicker — At RespondingOne of the things that makes ransomware especially problematic is its ability to spread very quickly. A person on one computer may click on an email or web link and get infected. Because that computer is connected with other computers in an organization, the problem proliferates.With ransomware, you typically have an hour before it spreads to your entire company. Yet most organizations are slow to respond.The Ponemon Institute says the mean time to detect a breach is 197 days. The research firm says responding to a breach typically takes another 69 days. Thus, an innovative solution is needed to both limit the damage and provide a fast response.Dynamic Isolation And Microsegmentation Provide Visibility, Faster ContainmentOne important step in limiting the impact of ransomware attacks is to get visibility into your digital assets and the flows between them. After all, you can’t protect what you don’t know.Monitoring networks and devices to look for anomalous behaviors is key. Network scanning is an important thing to watch for. It can signal that a bad actor is inside the network and assessing what’s around them.It’s also imperative that enterprises adopt a zero trust approach to cybersecurity. This assumes bad actors can and will get in — and are actually inside the enterprise network already. It employs solutions such as dynamic isolation and microsegmentation to limit the scope of damage.If a machine gets infected, microsegmentation makes sure it doesn’t spread that infection to the entire network. Dynamic isolation spots anomalous behaviors fast and installs agents on machines that are exhibiting strange behaviors. Dynamic isolation also ensures data on those machines stays safe, preventing bad actors from re-encrypting the data.Modern Technology Also Enhances Protection Of Critical Assets, Improved AuthenticationOrganizations also can improve their resilience to ransomware and other cybersecurity attacks by applying cryptographic network isolation to their backup systems.Cybercriminals know organizations are air gapping their “crown jewels” in backup systems and have started attacking those cyber recovery vaults. Adding cryptographic network isolation via microsegmentation can provide extra protection for those critical assets – securing all traffic into, out of and within the systems that work to lock down the crown jewels.There’s one more thing. Organizations can work to prevent ransomware from getting into their organizations in the first place by using two-factor authentication. That may involve employing technology such as biometrics to provide that second layer of defense.Cybersecurity attacks, including ransomware, are happening more frequently to more organizations of all types — and with more damaging results. It pays to have a Plan A, Plan B and Plan C to protect against these significant threats.Organizations that employ the suggestions outlined above can take extra steps to safeguard their most critical assets. They'll be able to quickly identify unusual behavior and move fast to contain it so they are far better positioned to avoid and recover from cyber events, including ransomware attacks. These tips and technologies can make organizations resilient to rapidly rising ransomware attacks."

24% of the bitcoin trading volumes. Big institutional investors that ...","Nov 19, 2019,07:30am EST","Cryptocurrency trading has emerged as the killer app of blockchain technology. Billions of dollars are exchanged daily on digital asset exchanges. Yet, it appears that most of the volumes are from retail investors. For example, earlier research showed institutions accounted for only 10% to 24% of the bitcoin trading volumes.","Big institutional investors that dominate traditional asset classes are just starting to dip their toes. Before they arrive en masse, trading technology has to catch up to what institutions are used to in equities and other established asset classes.In this article, I'm going to outline the missing technology elements that we noticed while developing our in-house trading platform for managing our own digital assets treasury.The ‘Traditional’ Setup""Institutional investors"" is a very broad term that includes a wide range of market participants, from passive fund managers overseeing index funds to niche hedge funds trading obscure securities.Most investors have more or less the same trading technology infrastructure provided by big investment banks that act as prime brokers. For example, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and JPMorgan serviced 80% of all hedge funds launched in 2018, according to Preqin data. They take care of almost everything: trade execution, securities lending, custody, clearing and settlements, and back-office work. These services were previously manual and are now done mostly with software. This work is largely commoditized, and institutional investors usually can pick whichever brokers they like most.Also, most institutional investors have access to the same financial market data, provided by, for example, Bloomberg and Thomson Reuters. Such services cost tens of thousands of dollars per user (for example, Bloomberg Terminal is $24,000 a year) but hardly provide an advantage, since everybody has the same information.Data Sources For Digital Assets Unlike in traditional asset classes, data for digital assets is disparate and not easy to use. Although, in crypto, data is mostly free. In particular, bitcoin and Ethereum’s public blockchains contain the full record of all transactions for anybody to read and analyze. Most cryptocurrency exchanges also publish their volumes.However, digital assets are a new phenomenon, and there are no dominant pricing models, for example, for fundamental analysis. Most digital assets do not have cash flows, and there are no obligations to disclose information in a structured way. In particular, U.S. federal disclosure requirements do not explicitly mention digital assets, and nontraditional assets require only ""brief"" descriptions.Since retail investors and traders make up most of the market, it is important to have a measure of the prevailing sentiment. Media coverage and social media chatter could be used to estimate the market mood.To get an edge in the market, you need to either find a new way to use the existing data or create new data sources. This may involve building your own analytical platform, just as my company has, but it’s also possible to uncover insights in public data by combining and integrating different sources.Automatic Strategy Testing And DeploymentBefore trading real money in the market, a trading strategy is first backtested on historical data and then forward tested using live data.For equities and other established assets, this can be done automatically using existing software, either developed in-house or provided by trading infrastructure specialists. Data is readily available for all instruments, although it could be very expensive.This is a lot less straightforward in digital assets. First, there are fewer years of market data observations. Bitfinex is one of the oldest bitcoin exchanges, was founded in 2012. Binance, one of the biggest altcoin exchanges, launched in 2017. There are dozens of other exchanges, and integrating all market data -- and adapting it for strategy testing -- is not an easy task.Because programmatic strategy testing in digital assets is difficult, a significant portion of portfolio managers in digital assets currently rely on passive holding and infrequent discretionary trading. During the bull run of 2017, this worked well, and crypto hedge funds on average generated 1,700%. But, in 2018 they made -71%, according to Eureka data.Quantitative algorithmic strategies are rare in digital assets, and there are few testing solutions for them. We had to develop our own trading platform to test strategies, optimize them and deploy them in production while managing risks. It’s important to be able to input and monitor strategies throughout the whole cycle: backtesting, forward testing and live trading. Be sure that your company's solution checks these same boxes.Order Execution For Cryptocurrencies In traditional asset classes, brokers guarantee the best execution. It is their legal responsibility to execute orders on behalf of their customers (for example, institutional investors) to get the best possible result in terms of price, costs, speed and other considerations. This is usually done programmatically, and it’s not something most investors need to think about.The whole idea of best execution in digital assets is still new. First, there is no regulation in crypto that would ensure that investors receive the best price execution. In fact, front-running is rampant on many exchanges, according to Bloomberg. Second, in our experience, many large trades are done via OTC desks, since even the biggest exchanges might not have the liquidity to execute orders quickly and without moving the price. This means the real costs of trades could be quite high.The solution is to develop basic order execution capabilities in-house. Your goal here should be to minimize slippage through executing orders programmatically. This should eventually become standard practice, but right now, even a simple programmatic execution can help to increase returns.ConclusionToday, the digital assets market is still too underdeveloped for most institutional investors. Technology infrastructure that they expect is not yet built -- possibly because there are too few paying clients who need that. This also means that there are plenty of opportunities for new players that are willing to invest in developing their own trading infrastructure capable of more than just passive holding."

A large branch broke off of a tree that had recently been checked by an arborist and declared healthy. Ignoring the arborist’s expert opinion, the branch broke off and fell anyway. My formerly sound, two-year-old car was towed to a repair shop, an estimate for repairs made, and my insurance company declared it not worth fixing. Totaled. But this shocking event had a couple good outcomes. The first was that I ended up leasing a nice new car. The second outcome was some education that is hard to come by, and has serious implications – I learned how valuable Blockchain technology would be in helping to coordinate the information and efforts of my car insurance company, the repair shop, and the car rental company that supplied me with a car until I could get a new one.Blockchain is the immutable distributed ledger technology, a kind of distributed database that powers Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, whose promise is actively being pursued in many industries. What Blockchain is all about is enabling countless independent parties with independent computer systems to interact with each other in a fast, secure way, sharing information to reach a mutually desired outcome. That’s exactly what we have here, with loads of insurance companies, a number of car rental chains, and untold thousands of car repair shops – all of whom need to share information and coordinate their efforts to help the consumer with the damaged car. Perfect for Blockchain!Think about the situation. Insurance companies are all about long documents with fine print, and long times on hold waiting to talk with someone who often can’t, in the end, do much but promise to send a form in the mail. You’ve probably driven by loads of auto repair shops. Which can handle the repair your car needs? How much will they charge? Will insurance pay for it? And then I’ll be without a car. Renting a car at the airport is one thing, but locally? How do I pick a company and get there. At the end I’ve got to deal with picking up my repaired car and returning the rental. Will insurance pay? It’s all yuck, yuck, yuck. Getting my car smashed is one thing, but this makes a bad situation worse. Imagine what a Blockchain-fueled application could do – it could eliminate the paperwork and calls, get the insurance company talking with the repair shops and car rental companies. Blockchain would enable electronic “paperwork” to be exchanged safely and securely. The insurance company could arrange for a local repair shop that can handle my car to do the repair – and pay them directly! They could dig up a local car rental company, and arrange for me to be picked up and dropped off at the end – and pay for the car directly! If things took longer than planned, all parties could communicate directly and just get it done. It would be a true distributed transaction application, minus the Bitcoin but with the transactions I care about now – getting my car fixed!I know I’ve expressed doubt about blockchain and cryptocurrencies in the past, while admiring their power. This could be the inflection point for me – a real, practical, everyday nightmare that would be transformed by Blockchain! Maybe I could even dive in and lead making it happen; wouldn’t that be ironic?Enough of living in fantasy-land – I’ve got a car that needs fixing. With dreams of a future Blockchain-fueled revolution in the back of my mind, imagine my shock as I went through the process, and found that everybody seemed to know everything! My insurance company knew a local repair shop to use, and contacted them for me. They also contacted a local branch of Enterprise Rent-A-Car, who sent someone out to pick me up. Then I found out that Enterprise knew where my car had been towed, and was ready to pick up their car from there when I went for it. Then I found out that my insurance company was paying the car repair shop directly, and paying Enterprise directly. Then when the estimate came in and my car was declared a total loss, things were taken care of until I could get a new car – which my insurance company also helped with. What’s going on here? Have they already implemented Blockchain?!I started asking some questions. It turns out that the nightmare of coordination and paperwork flying around was noticed decades ago. In 1994, Enterprise created the Automated Rental Management System (ARMS®) “to help insurance companies simplify the cumbersome process of managing replacement rental cars for policyholders.” By the early 2000’s, it was already widely used.Things progressed over the years. As of 2017, “hundreds of insurance companies and thousands of collision repair centers use Enterprise’s value-added system, which processes millions of transactions every year.”This sounds good, but there must be a catch. This could be some centralized, expensive enterprise system that locks everyone in. Well, maybe not:Central control? “ABS’ approach, on the other hand, enables collision repair centers, insurance companies and fleet owners to remain in control of their data for the long term – a high priority since vehicle technology and associated repair processes are changing rapidly.”What about data format standards, the tough thing for Blockchain? “The ABS system helps protect insurance companies, collision repair centers and fleet owners by converting their information from EMS (Estimate Management Standard) to a more secure protocol, BMS (Business Message Suite).”I’ve learned important things about Blockchain from this experience. I’ve learned that a huge problem in car repair, insurance and rental involving many disparate parties, has already been solved and is in production, used by industry giants and thousands of local businesses. This is just the kind of problem whose solution “everyone” says Blockchain “enables.” It’s in production today. It has evolved with technology,  No Blockchain needed. So why is it exactly that Blockchain is the key missing ingredient for solving distributed data, sharing and interaction problems of this kind?"

[+] power grids, manufacturing and oil refineries, says Microsoft","Iranian hackers are evolving their focus, targeting the so-called industrial control systems used by power grids, manufacturing and oil refineries. According to Wired, which spoke to Microsoft ahead of a presentation at the Cyberwarcon in Virginia on November 21, the active Iranian hacking group APT33 could be laying the groundwork for physical attacks. The Iranian group–also known as Holmium, Refined Kitten or Elfin–has been performing password spraying attacks over the last year, according to Microsoft’s research. Password spraying is a simple cyberattack that takes advantage of weak credentials by trying to access systems using common passwords. But the group’s focus is now apparently becoming more targeted: It has narrowed its focus to just 2,000 organizations, while increasing the number of accounts targeted by around 10 times. About half of the top 25 organizations targeted were manufacturers, suppliers or maintainers of industrial control system equipment–the systems that underpin critical infrastructure such as power grids, Microsoft’s report claims.Wired reported that the attackers’ motivations are not clear–nor is it possible to decipher which industrial control systems they have already breached. But Microsoft security researcher Ned Moran thinks that the group wants to lay the groundwork for physically disruptive cyberattacks. ""They're going after these producers and manufacturers of control systems, but I don’t think they’re the end targets,"" Moran told Wired. ""They’re trying to find the downstream customer, to find out how they work and who uses them. They’re looking to inflict some pain on someone’s critical infrastructure that makes use of these control systems.""Moran admitted there is no direct evidence to demonstrate a move from espionage and reconnaissance to a physical cyberattack, but the firm’s threat intelligence group has seen incidents that suggest APT33 is laying the groundwork. Indeed, Microsoft said the Iranian APT33 group’s fingerprints were present in multiple intrusions where the victims were later hit by Shamoon–malware used in attacks against oil companies. Governments are well aware of the threat posed by a cyberattack on critical infrastructure such as power grids. Discovered 10 years ago when it ravaged a nuclear facility, the Stuxnet worm is just one example. The result of this incident was a toolkit designed to specifically target the SCADA based systems that power critical infrastructure. These organizations are vulnerable because industrial control systems were not meant to be connected to the internet. In July, I reported that the U.S. government is planning to secure power grids from cyberattacks using “retro” technologies.This approach would mean adversaries have to actually physically touch the equipment, making cyberattacks much more difficult, according to a press release launched as the Securing Energy Infrastructure Act (SEIA), passed the Senate floor.And the threat is wide-ranging. Sam Curry, chief security officer at Cybereason warns that most countries are “highly vulnerable” to cyber-assaults on critical infrastructure. “Critical infrastructure is generally old, poorly patched and managed, and was designed before cyber threats were a significant concern. This means the ability to cause damage is significant if the attacker knows what they are doing.”Javvad Malik, security awareness advocate at KnowBe4 agrees, saying these kinds of attacks are “definitely things governments should be worried about.”“Once adversaries gain access to industrial control systems and similar utilities, there is a wide range of attacks they can conduct. The most worrying is the total disruption of the power grid, but there could be other scenarios such as using access to gain intel on energy users.”The Microsoft report also comes at a time of escalating tensions between the U.S. and Iran, and demonstrates the increasing threat posed by the nation. “Oh my, how APT33 has grown up,” comments CompTIA global faculty member Ian Thornton-Trump. “From early DDoS (distributed denial of service) attacks to website defacements with perhaps a side hustle of bitcoin stealing Iran is quickly–through the use of Russian and Chinese trainers–becoming a highly competent cyber adversary.”Thornton-Trump points out that “right now Iran has many powerful geopolitical rivals–Saudi Arabia, Israel–as well as many proxy groups they need to support.”“Iran has fully embraced cyber as part of its plan to move its political agenda, while at the same time isolating the county from the threat of an all-out shooting war,” Thornton-Trump says. Thornton-Trump says Iran was a “careful student of Estonia, Georgia and Ukraine Russian cyber operations” and has engaged the best Russian cyber operators to boost capabilities. “The results of the Iranian attacks have been significant and costly.”At a time when cyber warfare is a very real threat, attacks on critical infrastructure are certainly something be concerned about. It’s down to governments, critical infrastructure organizations and security providers to ensure the systems underlying power grids are as secure as possible."

As the maker of best-in-class graphics processing units, its hardware became a staple inside early Microsoft Xbox and Sony PlayStation gaming consoles.Engineers quickly discovered that CUDA, the underlying parallel computing software code, had wider applications for general computing.CEO Jenson Huang moved quickly to exploit the opportunity. He partnered with leading technology companies to push GPU-based computing into other sectors. In 2006, he reached out to the academic community with software development kits and application programming interfaces.This decision put Nvidia hardware at the center of a new computing movement.Siemens partnered with Nvidia in 2007 to build the world’s first 3D ultrasound machine. Tsubame 1.2, a supercomputer built by the Tokyo Institute of Technology, became the world’s first GPU-based supercomputer in 2008. Three years later, the Tianhe-1A, a Nvidia powered machine based at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, became the fastest.Sales soared as Nvidia GPUs moved into data centers, research facilities and universities, reaching $3.5 billion by the end of 2011.Today, GPUs play a vital role in artificial intelligence. They are used in the development of everything from to communication networks to industrial robotics and self-driving cars.This should be a good thing for Nvidia. Unfortunately, China and America are in the middle of a trade war.Citing national security concerns, hardliners in the U.S. Senate have been pushing to permanently blacklist major Chinese businesses. Huawei, the world’s largest maker of telecommunications equipment, is among the most well-known. Currently, American companies need to get special waivers to sell their semiconductors, peripherals and software to these companies.Currently, Nvidia logs 30% of its sales from China. And that’s why the Smart Everything Revolution is a big deal.The Smart Everything Revolution is Nvidia at its best. Huang sees an opportunity to build a new computing platform at the edge of the network, where most of the data is created. Small boxes attached to light posts, buildings and communications towers will process timely information on the fly and bounce the rest of the data to cloud-based data centers. In theory, everything will become connected, or smart.In essence, it’s the first step of the Internet of Things (IoT) revolution. It’s an adaptive, innovative solution, and it has the potential to do for the IoT what CUDA did for supercomputing.It also comes at a time when politics make diversification away from China desirable.The connective tissue would be the Nvidia EGX Supercomputing platform, a combination of cutting-edge hardware and software based virtual radio access networks.It’s not a coincidence that Fredrik Jedling, CEO of Ericsson, joined Huang onstage in Los Angeles. The telecom equipment company has struggled to match Huawei in the race to build out cost-competitive 5G wireless networks.The collaboration with Nvidia will help the Swedish company merge AI, the IoT and 5G networks. This combination should appeal to large telco companies looking to build new businesses models while remaining neutral in the trade war.Nvidia shares used to be easy to recommend. Managers put the company in the middle of all the most exciting computing applications. For a time, the firm could do no wrong.When cryptocurrency became a thing, and software developers rushed to building bitcoin mining rigs, naturally they turned to Nvidia GPUs. Almost overnight, a new $300 million business developed.Bitcoin mining eventually succumbed to falling cryptocurrency prices. And more recently Nvidia has become a victim of slowing sales to Chinese data centers and the trade war with China. The stock is recently down to $200 from its 2018 high of $288.70.It’s honestly too early to tell if the China data center woes have subsided. Nvidia will report financial results in November. However, what is certain is that Huang is moving the company to the edge of networks, while doggedly pursing the rest of the business.Shares trade at 28.7x forward earnings and 12.7 sales. These metrics might seem high relative to other technology companies, but they are significantly below the historic norms. Huang has done a masterful job creating value for shareholders.Even with the weakness from the highs, the average compound annual growth rate is 28.2% since that time. A stake of $10,000 would have grown to $654,353.This is definitely a stock to keep on your radar. Growth-oriented investors can add it on pullbacks."

The importance of determining policy on cryptocurrency in the House Financial Services Committee became high when Facebook’s Project Libra appeared to threaten the power of the U.S. dollar. In D.C., when an issue becomes “conflated”, it means that two ideas have been combined into one. When Chairwoman Maxine Waters (D-CA) stated, during the SEC Oversight hearing, about the Libra cryptocurrency, she then asked what the SEC was doing about the whole “blockchain phenomenon”. ","The theory goes that if cryptocurrency and blockchain are thought of as the same thing, then regulations on crypto might also apply to the technology. Additionally, were the U.S. to authorize any study or provide a grant for blockchain technology, should this concept be equated to using taxpayer dollars to launch an ICO, might mean that an investment in blockchain technology would be eliminated in the process. And so, in what might need to be called the “Pre-Libra Era”, Chairwoman Maxine Waters (D-CA) and Ranking Member Patrick McHenry (R-NC), had co-sponsored H.R. 3407, the Export Finance Agency Act of 2019, with a proposal for a survey of U.S. Exporters benefitting from the use of blockchain in their operations, including their management of supply chains, contracts, and payments. In the “Post-Libra Era”, and also as a direct result of the Democrats and Republicans failing to compromise on this bill, Chairwoman Waters introduced a brand new bill, H.R. 4863, also called the Export Finance Agency Act of 2019, with 22 of her fellow Democrats co-signing the bill. What had been removed from the bill? Besides the sponsorship of Ranking Member McHenry (R-NC), the survey on blockchain is no longer part of the bill. So, why is this important when other more pressing issues such as how the SEC will view tokens are on the minds of entrepreneurs working on the technology? While this appears nuanced, the bill would have required the Export Import Bank to conduct a survey on the impact of blockchain technology for five years in a row. Similarly, in the current debate on whether a ‘Central Bank Digital Currency’ that is issued by China would end up leaving the U.S. in the dust, if there is not advocacy for the research and development of blockchain technology in the U.S., we will get left behind. And, for the man whose company started all this, Mark Zuckerberg, is the oracle of this possible future as he testified to the Committee that, U.S. dominance in tech is not preordained. What is unfortunate is that, if this bill makes it way through the Rules Committee at 5pm today and then is addressed on the floor of Congress, the ‘deletion’ of these policy matters due to their inherent dangers - and because Members of Congress have conflated cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. Let’s hope that soon - and perhaps with one degree greater than hope - take action to ensure our policymakers can differentiate between a cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.

After skyrocketing to a leadership position in 2015 in the blockchain world, thanks to the founding of ConsenSys and his willingness to see potential in far-fetched ideas, Lubin and his amorphously-governed company suffered a setback at the end of 2018 when he had to lay off more than 10% of his staff thanks in part to longer than expected time to build the technology and slower than expected adoption. Now Lubin says ConsenSys has returned to a state of equilibrium and is slowly starting to hire again. In a rare in-depth interview with Forbes Crypto & Blockchain Advisor, Lubin waxed poetic about his willingness to work with the Chinese government to teach them the benefits of a public blockchain, shared his thoughts on Facebook’s Libra, chatted about blockchain consortium Hyperledger’s largest project to date and meticulously laid out his master plan for the next phase of Ethereum, which he and others working on the open-source project have dubbed Ethereum 2.0. Lubin’s work could end up laying the foundation for a new world order or prove to be a pipe dream.Excerpted from Forbes CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor. Forbes: How much of your work is focused on enterprises?Joe Lubin: ConsenSys or my personal work? Well, my personal work is ConsenSys, so ConsenSys itself is probably 65% focused on public mainnet. But almost everything we do is applicable in private permission context. We really see the distinction falling away increasingly over time. We’ve been saying that for a long time, so that’s been the vision.I spend a lot of time on the enterprise side in different nations, speaking to different businesses about business blockchain networks that we are standing up in ways that we can build on the public mainnet, or ways that we can link a business blockchain network into another business blockchain network. Such as Komgo—a group of companies using blockchain to streamline trade commodity finance and other applications—and some other network down into the base trust layer for collusion resistance or increased trust levels. I pay lots of attention to Ethereum 2.0. So we’ve got a lot of people at ConsenSys and are very close with many of the other groups around the world that are driving that effort.Forbes: What is Ethereum 2.0?Lubin: It is the natural extension of the Ethereum 1.0 platform. It will be realized as a separate network, but there will be a smooth evolution from Ethereum 1.0, both in terms of developer experience and in terms of how activity will flow from Ethereum 1.0 directly onto Ethereum 2.0 in the form of moving tokens and having smart contracts across the two systems that speak to one another. Pretty soon after phase zero of Ethereum 2.0 is stood up, the proof-of-stake mechanism for Ethereum 2.0—what we call the beacon chain—will be able to finalize blocks on Ethereum 1.0. So there will be this cross-linkage and a bunch of interdependency early on.Forbes: Can you give us specifications for Ethereum 2.0?Lubin: Ethereum 2.0 will be composed of three major phases: phase zero (the beacon chain), phase one where you hang 1,024 different shards off the beacon chain [this will allow transactions to settle in groups instead of on the entire Ethereum blockchain], and phase two where you turn those shards into not just storage but execution environments, just like the smart contract machine systems on Ethereum 1.0.Phase zero and phase one are not driven by user or developer experience. It’s a bunch of incredibly smart people solving very deep, distributed computing issues. Phase two is very much driven by developer experience. We have a team that’s building something called Quilt, which is focused first on what the users might want to see in a development environment.There’ll be different kinds of execution environments, so Ethereum 2.0 won’t be homogeneous in its execution environment—we’ll build some of the early execution environments essentially, and they will be very pleasant to use because we’re focusing on that early. It’ll enable us to build a much more scalable system in time and enable us to build different kinds of focused execution environments for different kinds of problems. Different architectures are more efficient for different problem domains.Forbes: Who are the users?Lubin: Software developers. But we also have many software developers that build products and services, and so their users are actual customers, whether they’re enterprise or government or bank or central bank customers, or whether they’re game players or people working on journalism platforms or music platforms.Forbes: How is enterprise demand changing things at the ones and zeros level?Lubin: Enterprise demand is just starting to change things at the ones and the zeros level. Ultimately this is all being built in the context of building out the decentralized World Wide Web—evolving web 2 to web 3. That involves public permissionless blockchains and it involves lots of other blockchains that link into those things.It also involves decentralized storage, bandwidth and heavy compute, among other things. We started with the toughest thing—the public permissionless blockchain, where anybody could attach byzantine environments. We solved that problem in effectively a not very scalable way, but it’s turning out to be remarkably scalable because we can build interesting solutions at layer two. This basic trust foundation so revolutionized trust on the planet, from subjective trust to automated trust, and guaranteed execution of agreements or objective trust upon that layer, that we’re now building what looks like the financial plumbing for the emerging decentralized economy. So all that stuff is going on while at the same time all these businesses figure, “Hey, we have this new trust tool so that we can collaborate much better.”Projects like PegaSys (formerly Pantheon)—it’s really the only project that spans that whole range where it’s implementing the enterprise specs. It’s an excellent client at the public mainnet level. And it has all the permissionless, or the permissioning systems, and the privacy confidentiality that businesses need. So we now have this component that’s situated in three really interesting places. It’s situated in the public Ethereum space, it’s situated in the enterprise Ethereum space, and now it’s situated in the Hyperledger space. Now enterprises are driving the evolution of the product.Forbes: Are you seeing enterprises getting comfortable with the idea of having to spend gas (pricing value required to conduct a transaction or execute a contract on the Ethereum blockchain platform) to take advantage of these decentralized systems?Lubin: Whenever you build out a revolutionary new technology you don’t focus on ease of use, you focus on demonstrating the principles and showing why it’s revolutionary. The Ethereum public machine has a whole bunch of gears and pulleys and sharp edges exposed, and you have to get in and turn cranks manually, etc.Paying gas as a user is not a good element if you care about onboarding a whole bunch of users. But if I’m a software developer and I’m releasing a game or any other application, I’d pay a huge amount for infrastructure. And so, somebody’s paying for that. There is the potential for certain use cases for users to pay miners or validators in the future for the infrastructure. Businesses already incur lots of those costs in the form of paying gas.Forbes: What is the Ethereum gas station network?Lubin: It’s a tool that’s getting a bunch of usage now, which basically flips things. It makes use of a technology called metatransactions, where you can just interact with a decentralized application (dapp). Anytime anything needs to be sent into the network and gas would have to be paid, the gas station network basically takes care of that. And that would usually be paid so there’d be a bunch of people who set up software to monitor those things and send them in and they would usually be paid by the developers. So it gets smoothed, and it avoids the scourge of the internet, which is relying on advertising to power all these applications.Forbes: Five years ago, did you think gas was going to be such a big obstacle to adoption?Lubin: I think we knew that user experience was problematic. We were looking at long strings of hexadecimal digits, so we knew we had to build the machine before painting it and covering it over with nicely shaped enclosures.Forbes: Has it been more difficult than you expected?Lubin: I’m kind of a stunned by how much progress has been made in such a short time. If you look at all the previous massive societal revolutions—mobile phones, the internet itself, the Web, cars, electricity—they all took a lot longer. We’re not really ten years into the decentralized Web revolution or evolution—we’re more like five years into it. Because bitcoin was a very narrow implementation and smart contracts were really invented about five years ago. And so it’s astonishing how many big companies, startups and just people care and think it’s going to be important.Forbes: Can you unpack the business component of reimagining the Web on a blockchain?Lubin: It’s not just on a blockchain; it’s on decentralized protocols. Blockchain is just one of them, but you need other ones like storage and bandwidth. What is the decentralized World Wide Web? It’s all the services we care about realized in collaborative networks that we can trust. Because they’re not owned by a single or subset of actors that are controlling the whole thing.Forbes: How important is the burgeoning network of 5G support going to be?Lubin: It’s really important. We’re looking into decentralized bandwidth. There’s Wi-Fi Aware, which is a technology that can enable us to link our phones to one another without anybody being able to shut down over pretty sizable distances now. Blockchain networks and tokenization will enable us to build those networks and enable us to share resources and pay each other with different tokens.Forbes: When you see what’s going on with the global race to 5G and China’s willingness to build a firewall to try to prevent its citizens from using competing cryptocurrencies, where does Ethereum fit into this sociopolitical turmoil?Lubin: It depends how good deep packet inspection gets. It depends how focused places like China are on controlling its digital borders because it can do it if it wants to. It may get more interesting as we have these satellite constellations—OneWeb, SpaceX and a couple others—and as we can do mesh networking, across borders, potentially. Ultimately, I feel like the ideas are so powerful. Essentially the internet woke up so much of the world by just enabling free access to information. I think it’s been complicated, but very largely positive for the planet.And if you see the potential of a new trust infrastructure and a new collaboration infrastructure and tokenization because you can have digital scarcity—and again, that’s dependent on trust—companies within nations like China are going to start to build on that, and it’s a powerful concept. Lots of people will say, “What if?” and “Why not?” and “Why isn’t this?”So I think in terms of getting the ideas out, the ideas are pretty powerful. Ultimately, unless everybody owns decent amounts of the infrastructure on which they live their lives, things will be unstable. So if we can build a society maybe in the Western world where it’s an ownership society, a stakeholdership society—and proof of stake is interesting, because we will be holding all these tokens that power the networks we live our lives on. You’re going to have to erect some pretty opaque, tall walls to keep that promise out. And unstable societies where a broad swath of the population isn’t benefitting probably won’t last.Forbes: Years ago, there was this mentality that there was almost no such thing as bad adoption. Like, anybody using anything blockchain or anything crypto was good. Companies that were committing horrendous crimes on the weekends were dropping press releases on the weekdays about how awesome blockchain is for transparency. Are you worried that China could subvert the benefits of blockchain?Lubin: I would love to help China get expert in Ethereum technology. One reason is if the Belt and Road Initiative [a program trying to connect Asia with Africa and Europe via land and maritime networks] uses one of the weaker technologies, and it sort of mandates that those networks be built in that technology, maybe it won’t be as interoperable. But the main idea is that Ethereum is the strongest of the blockchain technologies, and it’s a very positive virus to implant in people’s minds.Forbes: China has made it very clear that it wants to increase transparency and wants to prevent money laundering. It’s saying all the things we’ve been saying for years about what blockchain could do. But when it’s a notoriously oppressive regime talking about it, we start wondering, “How is it going to define money laundering, and what are they going to do with that transparency?”Lubin: China is a business that writes its own rules and has an enormous customer base—1.4 billion people. That’s a tough economic force to compete with. I do think there’s an instability. I think leaders are constantly terrified of revolution, so they have to keep the people relatively happy at some baseline level.Forbes: Do you assume that China’s cryptocurrency is going to be interoperable with other cryptocurrencies?Lubin: I assume it is going to be exactly what Chinese leadership thinks is most beneficial to Chinese leadership. Hopefully that’s also open and we can interoperate with it, but I don’t know. The country could do the calculation and decide there needs to be a firewall around it, or it could do the calculation and decide, “Hey, this is an incredible vector for destroying the American reserve currency status,” which is probably my guess.Forbes: Do you see a world where people might be spending crypto yuan on bread in Nebraska?Lubin: Have you seen Alipay in American airports?Forbes: Yes, I have. But isn’t it still U.S. dollars? I think that’s an important difference, isn’t it?Lubin: It is. But what’s it going to be next year and five years from now? China has the vector, and it will do what it can as quickly as it can.Forbes: Is there a technological development that is not blockchain that is capturing your attention right now?Lubin: Lots of decentralized stuff is really interesting. Many years ago, I had deep expertise in neural nets or deep learning. It should have been called shallow learning back then. So, I’m paying much more attention to that again. I’ve been in the financial world. I was pretty well-read on finance and economics 10, 15 years ago, and haven’t been paying too much attention there until recently.In the last year or so it’s become clear that what I’ve been saying for a long time, that our global financial and economic systems are essentially bankrupt, and the central bankers have been kicking the can down the road for a long time, and now that yield curves are flattening we may not have enough dry powder in the central banks to kick the can down the road and this recession could be really problematic. So I’ve been talking about potential cascading collapses if certain contagions happen.Forbes: What happened that brought your attention to your old career in finance again?Lubin: We’ve been building and hoping that central bankers could keep kicking the can down the road so that we could build alternative infrastructure—sounder foundations that enable more-sustainable growth on these systems. We’re not there yet; we need more time because the technology isn’t mature enough. Hopefully we get out of this one, and it isn’t a horrendous recession. No matter how deep it is, it’ll be called a recession, I think.What I’ve been paying attention to is the intersection of our ecosystem with the transition from the current economic regime on the planet, and the current monetary regime on the planet, because our monetary systems are end-of-life-ing right now. Facebook’s Libra is an interesting project—not based on who’s going to run it—if it does end up launching. But the idea that we could have cryptocurrency essentially with underlying baskets of currencies or nation-state bonds or commodities—that’s really, really interesting.Forbes: Going back to the concept of “there’s no such thing as bad adoption,” do you think this is progress or are you scared about Libra?Lubin: I don’t mind Libra at all. I don’t think Libra will be implemented because its biggest asset is its biggest liability. Lots of people should be able to sit up there on business blockchain networks with their own currencies. JPMorgan’s doing it, Signature Bank, etc. That’s all good. But linking its 1.3 billion global Facebook citizens through Calibra into all this is pretty scary.And essentially giving Mark Zuckerberg control over monetary politics of lots of small nations is concerning. So I do think that we should have lots of these systems. There should be choice and I think that lots of smaller countries would really benefit from the currency stability and being able to buy stuff frictionlessly across borders.I think those are great systems and as long as we have a bunch of them, providing choice, providing different underlying baskets, I think that’s going to be our new dominating monetary regime. And I think governments are going to like that because they’re going to be able to sell their debt into those systems.Forbes: You talked about the central banks kicking the can, is this an improvement—or is it just kicking the can down further?Lubin: I think it’s an improvement. I think it’s born of a really broken system that’s end-of-life-ing. But I think conceptually—if implemented well—it’s great. It’s optionality, it’s money. It is kind of dumb that a capitalist society controls the price of money. These systems will behave like businesses, and they will succeed or fail based on how they serve their customers.Forbes: In the time since Libra was announced, we’ve confirmed three interesting central bank concepts: the Libra concept, the People’s Bank of China concept and the idea that Mark Carney floated about a basket of currencies that the central banks willingly participate in. Do you have a favorite?Lubin: My favorite is optionality. I’d like to see lots of different experiments.Forbes: Is China’s cryptocurrency a threat to the U.S. dollar?Lubin: I don’t think so. Lots of things are threats to the U.S. dollar. China and Russia are making lots of effort to do business without using U.S. dollars, and other countries are following suit. There are lots of reasons why American influence is shrinking and will probably continue to shrink. That may not be a bad thing, but in some ways, it’ll be a bad thing. China’s particular cryptocurrency I don’t think is a major factor.Forbes: My colleague Jeff Kauflin wrote an article a while ago about ConsenSys and its job situation. How is the slightly more slender version of ConsenSys, progressing? Are you hiring again yet?Lubin: We’ve probably hired 100-150 people since December.Forbes: Since the culling is there a net growth?Lubin: Pretty steady state. We’re at 1,000.Forbes: Where is the growth coming from with respect to zero knowledge proof?Lubin: Our own Pegasus Group is doing some breakthrough work there. You’re aware of Ernst & Young’s activities on that front, so it’s doing some cool stuff. And we have a portfolio company that we work really closely with called Aztec, which is building out a whole bunch of zero-knowledge components that you’ll be able to stack together and compose in two different kinds of solutions, like Lego blocks.Forbes: What do you think about the work currently underway at Hyperledger where a number of giant companies are trying to work together to build the Trusted Compute Framework, which would move computational trust off-chain?Lubin: That’s an even bigger stew of different technologies. Trusted computing involves hardware and software, and trusted execution environments and secure enclaves. Even within narrow categories like zero-knowledge proofs, there are many different approaches, usually varying depending on the setup of the system—whether it’s trusted, or whether there’s one big setup where you have to do it a bunch of times. And how much computation is required to essentially do the encryption, and how much to verify it? It’s a very young technology, and lots of different groups are employing it.Forbes: How is this going to be done successfully? There’s a lot of different people trying to build the Trusted Compute Framework at the same time. It’s open source; it’s part of the foundation. It feels like a Frankenstein monster, but it might be beautiful.Lubin: It’s a Frankenstein monster, just like the internet and the Web are Frankenstein monsters. It’ll be built through merit, through lots of different really talented people exploring the solutions base, openly collaborating—not 100% openly—but collaborating a lot. And the best there won’t be one best technology because there will be different technologies that are suited to different use cases. It’s moving fast and if you read or are aware of the cathedral in the bazaar, it’s not being built in a top down, control-like fashion. That wouldn’t be as effective as a whole lot of brilliant ants scurrying around and getting collective work done.Forbes: Thank you."

The numbers have risen to 56 percent, up from 47 percent in 2017.At the same time, their collaboration with local Adult Protective Services operations to protect seniors from financial abuse has climbed to 81 percent from 62 percent.Roughly about 55 percent of the banks surveyed said to lure seniors they offer them accounts with low or no minimum balance requirements, reduced monthly maintenance fees, free checks, free money orders and/or discounted safe deposit boxes.Last year the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) mandated investment brokers ask customers for a trusted contact in large measure as a way to give seniors a “second set of eyes” to protect them from fraud.“Larger financial institutions, like Bank of America and Wells Fargo Advisors, began making this a practice on the banking side as well,” the report revealed.One of the less publicized problems about protecting seniors from fraud is the Power of Attorney papers they are showing their financial professionals can be faulty, so some banks are insisting on using their own formsJosh Brown at  director of security for Fauquier Bank in Northern Virginia told the authors his institution  has a careful process for reviewing Power of Attorney documents for their customers, looking for the customers’ best interest by identifying obvious problems and red flags to run up to the bank’s attorneys as needed.To see the full report, click on:"

(Photo by YURI CORTEZ / AFP) (Photo credit should read YURI CORTEZ/AFP via Getty Images)","Venezuela’s human-made economic calamity just took a turn for the worse.The country’s national debt is now almost double the level of the GDP. At the end of the second quarter, total borrowing hit 198.4% of GDP, up from 102.8% a year earlier, according to a recent report from the Washington D.C.-based think tank, the Institute of International Finance.It gets worse. Those figures don’t even include what households and businesses owe. When those get added, then the total is 221% of GDP.The data also means that Venezuela’s government is twice as indebted than is the debt-loving U.S.A. where government borrowing hit 106% of GDP at the end of last year.At one level, Venezuela’s problem is multi-faceted.In short, those four items are symptoms of Venezuela’s epic economic headache.Each of the problems mentioned might have specific causes, but in the end the blame really rests with just one person: Nicolas Maduro, the country's socialist leader. His disastrous economic policies have led to the current mess.The first piece of stupidly was to avoid linking the country’s currency the Bolivar to the U.S. dollar. That is what many oil-rich countries in the middle east, Such as Saudi Arabia, do because it helps stabilize their economies through the periodic boom-bust energy cycle. It’s doubtful whether Venezuela would be in this mess if the country adopted the dollar as its currency. Other policy errors would be humorous if it they weren’t inflicting massive pain on the country’s people.For instance, one notable piece of idiocy from Maduro arrived early last year when inflation was running at around 7,895%. Maduro's solution was to combat the declining value of money by eliminating some of the zeros from the paper Bolivar bills.In other words, a ten thousand Bolivar note would now be worth 10 Bolivars in the new money. Such as move has never successfully curbed inflation anywhere on the globe at any time. To think it could have worked is dumb.Another effort of Maduro’s, a little over a year ago, involved launching a new cryptocurrency, the Petro. While Bitcoin, the most famous crypto in the world, has some drawbacks, it looks like a rock-solid bet compared to the Petro.The Petro was supposed to be a better bet than other cryptos because it would get backed by Venezuela’s oil riches. However, given that even the local Venezuelan’s weren’t interested in the Petro, the digital currency seems to have disappeared into obscurity, just like Beanie Babies (the hot collectible toy of two decades ago.)Given Maduro’s past errors things likely won’t get better until someone with economic sense takes over."

And foot traffic to banks has fallen by 50%. Bank branches are shutting down left and right for a simple reason... They’re useless!These days, you can deposit a check by taking a photo with your phone. You can open a bank account or order a new credit card in five minutes over the internet. You can even take out a mortgage without ever seeing a human banker, thanks to disruptive services like Quicken Loans.And it’s not just banks. Digital disruption is eating away at every “old” business model in finance. Everyone from stockbrokers to financial planners is under assault.Money used to represent a claim on a “real” asset like gold, silver, or land. Then money became paper. Paper money has no ties to anything “real”... but at least you can see it and touch it.Now even paper cash is fading away. How often do you pay with cash? If you’re like most Americans, probably not very often.More and more, money is just digital entries in computers. There’s no physical trace... it’s going 100% digital.The “business” of money is going the same way. Banks are closing their doors… stockbrokers are dying off... even hedge fund managers are losing their jobs to computers.The digitization of everything money is an unstoppable, “carved-in-granite” trend. One that’s already minted a lot of millionaires... and is going to mint a whole lot more.In this article, I’ll tell you about a tiny company that makes the financial “plumbing” of the internet. It’s growing like crazy... you likely use its service without knowing it... and you’ve probably never heard of it.For example, Square (SQ) disrupted cash registers and gained 674% in under four years. RiskHedgeIf you don’t know Square, it’s a godsend for small business owners. It makes the little white boxes that plug into your phone to swipe a credit card. Square also owns the popular CashApp, which lets you send money instantly—similar to PayPal or Venmo. These are staggering returns. But they’re just a taste of what’s to come...Today, 414 private companies are worth more than $1 billion. And get this… 52 of them are fintech!Venture capitalist (VC) investors have poured capital into fintech startups for a simple reason: huge profits are a stake.The global financial services industry is one of the biggest on the planet. It’s poised to be worth nearly $27 trillion by 2020. That’s far more than the annual economic output of the United States!No serious investor can afford to ignore the exciting things happening in fintech.I’ve studied practically every private fintech company. Several are promising, but my research keeps leading me back to a company called Plaid.Plaid is far from a household name. You won’t find it in the “app store.” Unlike more famous fintech “unicorn” Robinhood, you won’t see commercials for Plaid on TV.…including giants like Bank of America, JP Morgan, and Wells Fargo.Plaid serves as a bridge between banks and thousands of apps that involve transferring, spending, or investing money. In short, it built out the digital “plumbing” of fintech.Plaid’s reach is incredible. According to the company, nearly one out four Americans use Plaid through one app or another.For example, Plaid allows you to buy bitcoin from your checking account through the app Coinbase. It allows you to trade stocks on Robinhood. It powers popular apps like Venmo and CashApp.Plaid’s business is booming. Its revenues quadrupled between 2016 and 2018. And it’s reportedly close to producing positive cash flow.Importantly, Plaid is building a lasting business model... unlike many “hot” private companies that seek “growth at all costs.”The titans of financial services are betting on Plaid too. Visa (V) and American Express (AXP) invested in Plaid recently. Goldman Sachs (GS) and Citi Group (C) have also backed the company through their venture arms.The company hasn’t yet filed its “S-1,” which companies must file before they go public.Because of its “boring” business, Plaid probably won’t get a ton of hype heading into its IPO.It will slide under most investors’ radar. As regular RiskHedge readers know, these are exactly the type of overlooked IPOs that often dish out the biggest gains.Take Stitch Fix (SFIX) – an online personal styling platform. Heading into its November 2017 IPO, Stitch Fix was valued at just $1.4 billion. There wasn’t much hype around it.SFIX surged 246% in its first 11 months as a publicly traded company.Cardlytics (CDLX), which helps banks run reward programs, has zoomed 280% since its February 2018 IPO.Carvana (CVNA)—an online platform for selling used cars—also had a monster IPO. Since going public at a modest $2 billion valuation in April 2017, CVNA has skyrocketed 703%!Keep in mind, any individual investor could have bagged these returns.

What will the next decade ... [+] bring?","This last decade in the world of technology was exciting, innovative and turbulent, all at the same time. I would argue that in the last forty years of computing, these last ten years had the most technological advances of any decade. We saw tremendous innovation, the spectacular good and bad influence of social media, the significance of smartphones in personal and business lives and a mad dash for all enterprises to begin a digital transformation. Businesses began to move completely from an analog and client-server past to an all-digital and cloud future. In the last decade, it became clear that companies like Google, Facebook, Twitter and others became gatekeepers of tons of personal data from their customers. Today those entities are under major governmental scrutiny over the true ownership of that data and the privacy and security issues surrounding that data. And they are now being pressured to breakup some of these companies to keep their total position of influence in check. The last decade also made it clear that technology would play a major part in powering a phase of economic growth that dwarfs any other period in history in terms of technology's role in global GDP.The first two decades of personal computing began in 1977 when Apple introduced the Apple II and followed shortly thereafter with IBM’s PC, laid the foundation for the PC industry’s growth. The PC had a major impact and redefined business productivity around the world. By 1999, the PC industry was selling close to 350 million PC’s a year worldwide and the computer and IT industry overall was bringing in about $900 billion in total revenue. Starting in 2000, that decade saw the birth of the iPod and the iPhone. The IT industry began a bigger shift to client/servers becoming the backbone of IT shops. It was also the decade where companies like Oracle, SAP and similar back-end software firms accelerated their role in providing the client/server software to run all phases of a company's business and shifted IT away from localized software. It also saw the rise of CRM-based software used to manage customer sales and customer services and accelerated the growth of companies like Salesforce. By 2008-2009, all of these back-end software behemoths began shifting their software away from client/server applications and launched the IT world towards cloud-based architectures and solutions.While the decade of 2000-2009 saw tremendous growth of tech and its far-reaching effect on the world, this last decade from 2010 to 2019 extended its reach even further. Although Facebook started in 2004, it was only in the last ten years that it grew to have over 3 billion users and became one of the most influential tech companies in the world. Likewise, Twitter started in 2006, but its real growth and influence were felt in this decade. If you were a fortune-teller in 2009, could you have imagined the following things that would happen in the next decade of tech?These are just a few of the major evolutions in tech that were developed and influenced our world over this last decade. Given my propensity to make my predictions for tech in a new year, I was tempted to do a piece on my forecasts for the next decade. But as I looked at this list shared above, I think it would be difficult for anyone to forecast the next decade, other than to suggest that we most likely will have self-driving cars by 2030. Or that AR, VR and Mixed Reality could play a major role in delivering the next major personal computing platform. Instead, I have decided to reach out to the CEOs and top leadership from some of the major companies in the tech world and ask them for the visions and goals for their companies over the next decade.I will soon begin a series called “Looking Back, Looking Forward” where I review specific companies' successes and even failures over the last ten years and ask these firm’s leadership what they hope to achieve in the next decade.I have two criteria for when I write these articles. The first is that I have covered them as part of my job over the last decade. Since I have been covering most tech companies as an industry analyst since 1981, most of the companies I will profile easily fit into that bucket. The other thing I want for these articles is to accurately portray the leadership of these companies' vision, goals and challenges for the next decade. To that end, I plan to interview these leaders personally to get their views and ask them directly about what they want their companies to accomplish over the coming decade.Being at the end of one decade gives us a chance to reflect on what happened in the world of tech over the last ten years. It also allows us to evaluate where the world of tech is today and what it might have in store for us over the next decade. During the next month or so I will be speaking with key leaders in tech and hearing what they think the next decade of computing will hold for them and what key trends will dominate the next ten years. "

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)","The performance of value has sucked for some time now. Since 2007, in fact. This has prompted a flurry of articles questioning whether value investing is, in fact, dead. However, sometimes we can achieve better outcomes by asking better questions. In this case the better question is should value investing still be part of a multi-factor portfolio? And the answer seems to be yes. The supporting evidence here appears substantial.If you’re placing a bet on value as a standalone factor, then maybe you’re doing it wrong. Research from Antti Ilmanen and colleagues at AQR has shown that combining factors can lead to improved outcomes and risk management over time.This may not fit how we like to make decisions. We like to know if something works or not. We like to get to yes or no answers. But we can make better decisions by moving away from binary yes or no choices. Historically combining factors has been a neat strategy and a less risky one. That strategy has worked historically continued to work in past years, even as value has lagged. A multi-factor strategy is likely to continue to work in future if history is any guide.For example, yes value has had a rough decade and counting. That’s enough to test anyone’s patience. But another factor, momentum, is doing very well over the same period. There’s some evidence that value and momentum can help balance each other over time as Meb Faber has documented. So the overall model still holds, factors can still help your portfolio. It’s just in recent history momentum has carried the load while momentum has lagged.Does that mean that we should load up on value and drop momentum now? Well, no. sadly, it’s tough to time factors. Yes, momentum may lag at some point in the future and value will more than likely have it’s day once again. But this is hard to forecast. In addition, doing so can increase the costs of trading and potentially taxes too. As such, let’s not make it hard for ourselves by picking factors in isolation and trying to time them. Consider owning them in combination. That way we’ll perhaps see some risk reduction from owning factors together. Yes, we’ll be frustrated when a particular factor (currently value) does not deliver and consider adding more of whatever’s working well (currently momentum). However, the data is persuasive that these factors a pretty hard to time effectively. So continuing to hold factors in balance may be the better plan.If you’re wondering if value is dead, you are asking the wrong question. The question is do factors continue to work in combination? Of course, value isn’t pulling its weight right now, but that’s historically pretty normal. For example, value underperformed between 1926 and 1941. If you end up throwing it out or going all in on it on alternate factors, based on your view, all you’ll likely do is hurt your returns going forward. Historically spreading your bets across factors has been smart, and there’s little reason to think that’s going to change. Don’t completely give up on value, but don’t necessarily double-down on it either. It has a place in many portfolios, just like many other things. Binary choices on value investing may cause worse outcomes. Let’s ask better questions and consider how factors work in combination."

Disclosure: I own some bitcoin ...","Editors' Pick|Nov 18, 2019,06:55am EST",Chime app,"A growing throng of startups are betting you’d like to do your banking on your smartphone. San Francisco-based Chime, which offers a debit card with no monthly or overdraft fees, has seen its revenue explode over the past year. In 2019, it will reach nearly $200 million, a fourfold increase over 2018, according to a person familiar with the matter. Now the company plans to expand into other products like credit cards and investment services in its quest to become a full-service digital bank. Chime has attracted five million accounts—or roughly 3.3 million customers, based on an estimated average of 1.5 accounts per customer—through a few key strategies. First, it has offered products for free that banks have traditionally charged money for, like basic checking accounts with no minimum balances, and it has packaged them into an app that customers rate highly. Second, it has spent heavily on marketing. The startup sank $32 million into TV ads during the first eight months of 2019 alone, according to research service Kantar, and that doesn’t include any online marketing expenses. Neither strategy would be possible without the $300 million that Chime has raised in venture capital. Third, it has convinced more than one million people to sign up for direct deposit, having their paychecks sent to their Chime debit account, a source says. Reaching a large customer base is critical for Chime, partly because it doesn’t target affluent users. Its average customer is between 25 and 35 years old and earns between $35,000 and $75,000 a year. And the startup makes almost all its money on interchange—the 1% to 2% fees that banks charge retailers each time a debit or credit card gets swiped—so Chime wants you to make all your purchases using your Chime card. If it can convince you to deposit your paycheck there, you’re better equipped to use the card for shopping. ▸RELATED: Chime Bank ReviewTo woo customers who use the card often, Chime requires that they sign up for direct deposit to access key features. If you’d like to access your wages two days earlier than you would with a traditional bank, you must sign up for direct deposit. The same goes if you want to overdraw your Chime account up to $100 without paying any interest or fees. In nearly all its marketing materials, it encourages people to sign up for direct deposit. Chime has processed more than $30 billion in transactions this year, up from $10 billion in 2018, despite an outage last month that prevented customers from making purchases and seeing their balances.Yet a large hurdle remains: Chime hasn’t proved that it can persuade customers to use multiple products, a “bundling” strategy that’s the cornerstone of traditional banks’ high profitability. Max Friedrich, an analyst at New York investment manager Ark, thinks it will be “challenging” for digital banks to expand into more profitable categories like lending. Chime plans to launch a new, free feature to help users boost their credit scores next year, says CEO Chris Britt, although he declined to provide details. He also plans to launch a credit card in the first half of 2020 and eventually move into personal loans. After that he’ll launch investment services, such as low-fee exchange-traded funds and retirement services, potentially in 2021. Britt is also considering installment loans, where people can finance purchases in periodic payments. Chime’s growth is strong, but can it build a profitable, sustainable business? Britt claims Chime could be profitable today if it reduced its marketing budget. He says its gross profit margin is “very high” and “resembles a software company’s.” Two other important indicators of profitability are how much it costs Chime to acquire a new customer and how much each customer is worth over his or her lifetime. Traditional banks pay $750 to acquire new customers whose lifetime value is about $4,500, according to Dan Rosenbaum, a partner at management consulting firm Oliver Wyman. It costs Chime less than $100 to acquire a customer that signs up for direct deposit, Britt says, and those customers are worth “thousands” if you assume they stick around for 10 years. That’s a good place to be if Britt’s forecast for how much his customers are worth turns out to be accurate. New York digital bank MoneyLion, which targets customers in the Midwest, pays between $40 and $50 to acquire engaged customers who use at least three of the startup's products. It says those users are worth between $1,200 and $1,500 if they stay with MoneyLion for two years. Some think digital bank valuations have gotten out of hand. In recent conversations with venture capitalists, Ark’s Max Friedrich says, “The sentiment was that the valuations for challenger banks were too high, and they expect them to come down.” Chime is reportedly trying to raise new funding at a $5 billion valuation, up from $1.5 billion just eight months ago. Britt won’t comment on the topic, other than to say the company is already “well capitalized” and that “given the strength of the business … there is definitely interest from a lot of prospective investors.”"

However, a study of S&P 500 stocks going back to 1871 by Robert Arnott and Clifford Asness (Surprise! Higher Dividends = Higher Earnings Growth, Financial Analysts Journal, 2003) observed the exact opposite.The authors suggested that managers of companies with high payout ratios may have confidence in the stability and growth of their earnings and tend to be much more selective in their capital investments. For low or no payout ratio firms, managers may retain too much of their firm’s earnings because of a desire to build up empires and subsequently use their cash hoard in a wasteful fashion.The 20 stocks that made the AAII Journal’s First Cut are among those with the current highest payout ratios in the S&P 500 index. The seven-year average payout ratio provides a historical company perspective.Data as of October 14, 2019.While more than 80% of S&P 500 member companies pay a dividend, just 187 pay out at least 40% of their earnings as dividends. Since a high payout ratio can signal an inability to grow or maintain the dividend, we required the passing stocks to meet two additional criteria. First, the indicated dividend must be above the dividend paid for the most recently completed fiscal year. Secondly, the I/B/E/S consensus earnings estimate must signal earnings growth for the current fiscal year. Real estate investment trusts (REITs) were also excluded since they pay distributions instead of qualified dividends.Finally, a price-earnings ratio below the average for the last five years was required to identify those stocks that may be undervalued on a relative basis.Excerpted from November issue of AAII Journal."

[+] as many prominent venture capital firms have offices along the road. (Photo via Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images).","I’ve been writing a lot recently on the unintended problems of platform economies; especially on the back of the recent launch of The Open Application Network, working to solve these very problems using a new type of App infrastructure fuelled by the blockchain.That said, I find myself fighting an uphill battle to convince people that their favorite Silicon Valley darlings potentially have a dark side. As much as I work to build a new narrative to shine a light on these growing issues, most people still need some convincing. If you want to learn more about the problems I’m talking about, check out my last article here.In the process of writing and researching these topics, I kept stumbling on the same question: why does every successful online platform look the same? Putting aside the good or service they provide (rides on Uber or room bookings on Oyo), it seems like the majority of these companies have built business model replicas in different verticals, and across different geographies. Some would argue that these companies are simply putting in practice a proven model that benefits consumers, but others are now starting to ask whether this is fuelled by outside interests.Last week I read a great piece in the New York Times that captures what I’ve been trying to put into words. The SoftBank Effect: How $100 Billion Left Workers in a HoleThe authors tell a great story that is too often ignored. The online platforms we use every day are built on unsustainable economic models that eventually pit these companies against their stakeholders, for the long term benefit of their shareholders.The piece in the New York Times highlights a few examples of how SoftBank has seemingly been complicit in tactics that have fuelled artificial growth in some of its portfolio companies to inflate valuations, ultimately leading to a massive misalignment between these platforms and their stakeholders who are trying to earn a living on their respective markets.Although not a symptom of the same problem of overcapitalization, even organically growing and profitable platforms are starting to fall into the same short-term thinking that will see them become the antagonists in the markets they’ve created, all for the sake of “growth”. Take the recent news of Shopify Email launching - a directly competing product to MailChimp - only 6 months after MailChimp was pushed out of the Shopify marketplace.Although the New York Times article singles out SoftBank, this is a deeper-rooted issue that is seen in many of the world’s leading tech investors.This was well summarized in Chamath Palihapitiya’s 2018 letter to investors at Social Capital.Over the past decade, a subtle and sophisticated game has emerged between VCs, LPs, founders, and employees. Someone has to pay for the outrageous costs of the growth described above. Will it be VCs? Likely not. They get paid to allocate other people’s (LPs) money, and they are smart enough to transfer the risk. For example, VCs habitually invest in one another’s companies during later rounds, bidding up rounds to valuations that allow for generous markups on their funds' performance. These markups, and the paper returns that they suggest, allow VCs to raise subsequent, larger funds, and to enjoy the management fees that those funds generate. Of course, over a short enough period, these tactics lead to exactly the types of growth metrics investors in both private and public markets are looking for. That said, throughout a company’s life, this house of cards eventually starts to wobble.Does this end in a foregone conclusion?As in any market, competition leads to better outcomes for consumers. The unique challenge in Silicon Valley is that companies are creating brand new markets all the time, and as such are effectively monopolizing their economics. It’s not difficult then to imagine the motivation of a company to protect and grow such a monopoly.Unfortunately, this behavior leads to the very real (although mostly hidden) risk that consumers and creators alike will eventually flee towards the markets that give them more choice - markets that are more open and encouraging of competition.Where do you think the future e-commerce merchant will house its business? Where will the future gig-economy worker make its living? Where will advertisers choose to connect with consumers? Where will app developers build their new features?As creators and consumers, we need to demand more from these companies building our future. We deserve markets that lead to better outcomes for everyone.VCs need a new model that aligns them to healthy outcomes for the markets they're investing in, rather than the short term metrics of the companies in their portfolios. Although not the way that most people think of blockchain protocols, this industry has created a mechanism for economic alignment to an open market, rather than to a closed platform. Investing in the right protocol’s asset - be it Ether, Aion, DOTS, or others - effectively aligns investors to successful outcomes for all stakeholders operating in the markets built on top of that protocol.Some investors have started shifting their behaviors with significant investments in blockchain protocols, but we still have a long way to go before the problems facing these platform economies are addressed by this new market. VCs hold an important responsibility in this transition, seeing as they often lead new markets in thought leadership and consumer behaviors. We should demand more from this highly influential group effectively deciding what our future will look like."

The experience, which initially launched on Google Daydream in early 2017, managed to become the industry’s most notable meta-property—all while form-fitting to the three degrees of freedom then afforded to mobile headsets. It explored issues of virtuality, automation, and the future of labor through expert writing, art direction, and interaction design to push the language of immersive storytelling.Now, after previews at Sundance Film Festival and IndieCade, the studio behind VVR is back with the official Oculus Quest launch of The Under Presents—a title that finds Tender Claws again pushing the envelope for the language of immersive storytelling.The first thing you need to know about The Under is that a lot is happening in The Under. The game is particularly notable, though, in its presentation of narrative and agency; its integration of immersive theatre and live interactivity; and its interaction design.The first exterior players encounter upon learning the ""scrunch"" locomotion mechanic.In The Under Presents, there is definitely a meta aspect at work, but not quite so obviously as in VVR. Worlds nest within and throughout each other—be they ships in bottles or time loops. The “main” area of the game is the eponymously named main stage. This is where players can experience shows, which, depending on the time, are performed by live actors in real time (more on that a bit later). This serves as the game’s main hub—but it’s not where you start.The onboarding experience to the game is a long “fade up” opening scene in a desert (of sorts). There are no words—things just happen, like when you a graphic indicates for you to “snap” your hands into existence from underneath the ripples of clay, and simple graphics indicate the game’s unique mechanics (more on that later too). Once you’ve gotten the hang of things, you make your way toward a bar. As you near it, you hear sounds emanating from within, only...you can’t get open the doors. This is when you meet the MC, an enigmatic character in the experience who serves as a sort of guide—though it’s clear that something is kind of off about him.The MC is a sort of guide throughout the experience—but not everything is as it seemsHe ushers you through the main space—helping players acclimate to the space and their abilities within it. But player be warned: he decidedly never gives you all the answers, and moreover the game never sacrifices its artistry to ease player confusion. In other words: there will be moments where you feel like you’re lost, doing it wrong, or the first person to encounter some weird bug. In fact, you’re being conditioned to the dream—or nightmare—logic of The Under.There’s a lot more to say about all these moments—the way users play with iterations of themselves across time loops, the first time they encounter a stage performance—but this is a meaty, dense game, with hours of playtime in store. It’s best experienced without knowing too much.A cutaway of The Aickman, a research ship that forms the site of the longform narrative in 'The ... [+] Under Presents'The final bit to note here, though, is that the main longform narrative takes place in The Aickman, a research ship that finds itself in disaster. Players can experience The Aickman from diorama scale to true-to-life—and manipulate time to uncover the secrets of what befell it over the course of three acts (and possibly change that through participation).A view inside The Aickman in 'The Under Presents'For anyone who has been to an immersive theatre experience, The Under Presents will feel familiar. It’s intrinsic in every aspect—the onboarding, the staging, the way narrative pockets can be experienced non-linearly and lucidly—but most obviously it’s in the fact that, unlike most at-home VR experiences (really most VR experiences in general), there are real actors giving live and scripted performances in The Under. These live performances will continue for an initial run of the next four months. And, as an extension: the game is “multiplayer,” meaning other real people might experience these performances with you.After realizing they wanted to creatively incorporate live actors, Tender Claws aligned with New York City-based experimental theatre collective Piehole to figure out how to create an experience that managed to bridge IRL and digital immersion.“We wanted to explore the relationship between theater, games, and immersive worlds; particularly, ideas of “performance” and player/audience agency: especially in relation to narrative,” Tender Claws Co-Founder Samantha Gorman said in an interview with the author. “What about a game was theatrical and what about ‘performing’ and audience behavior spoke to player agency and intention. We ourselves also have a background in performance. Importantly, we had admired Piehole’s work in devised and experimental theater for some time. Because of their smart approach to constraints and form, we knew that they could tackle this challenge and wanted to work together.”The ""Wet Food"" performance in The UnderIn case the description of the narrative above didn’t already communicate this: The Under Presents is idiosyncratic. It blurs formal boundaries as an expression of its obsession with time, the motif of looping, and the binary that exists between agency and predetermination. This notion of the experience’s “liveness” doesn’t just apply to the fact that it’s possible that users will interact with other real people (whether as users or actors). In fact, it’s part of the rhetorical conceit of the project.“The project's narrative revolves around the idea of agency in changing fate and free will; what is recorded and what is changeable and ‘alive,’” Gorman said. “It was inspired by the novel The Invention of Morel where the protagonist engages with a looping recording he considers alive. How does his projection of who is alive change his behavior? We are interested in playing with the feeling of interacting with both pre-recorded and live characters, as well as other players and past recorded versions of themselves.”And the literary influences don’t end there. Gorman also references the notion of a “ractor”—an actor in interactive movies in Neal Stephenson’s Diamond Age—as a subject of exploration in creating The Under Presents. A vital aspect of creating an experience that’s this far outside the expected realm of its contemporaries is how it can contribute to the creative lexicon.“What is a new vocabulary of crowd work, improv, and performance in a world where players are operating under the paradigms of games and can interact at any given time?” Gorman said.Still of the Deepali performance in The UnderThough, Gorman acknowledges that part of this evolution of the creative language involves excavating the gems of existing ones. In this case, the Tender Claws team took a deep dive into immersive theatre—how these plays are conceived, written, structured, directed, and performed. This even goes so far as to incorporate “one-on-one” experiences—virtual versions of the type offered in productions like Sleep No More.“We are borrowing structures and vocabulary from contemporary immersive theater,” Gorman said. “The Aickman features multiple characters and multiple threads happening ‘around’ the player simultaneously. The barrier of the stage is removed and the audience is placed within the narrative. In The Under itself, players may encounter live actors and occasionally pulled aside for a “one-on-one” experience. The idea of intimacy, feeling chosen and being ‘seen’ is important.”In my experience, this aspect of reality-crossing extended beyond the moments of encountering live human performances—being handed a rose, having objects tugged from my grasp, playing catch-up with an avatar darting out of the Under. The simple knowledge that at any time it could be a live counterpart granted a life force and magic to the space that I’ve only otherwise felt in immersive theatre experiences.Two players cheersing each other in 'The Under Presents'That feeling, whether as a shared or private experience, is intimacy. This subject was a major point of focus for Tender Claws in developing The Under—and shares ties with an entertainment format that took root a century ago.“Into the 20th century, Vaudeville was also marketed as ‘variety,’ a series of eclectic acts that were on the same bill,” Gorman said. “The Under presents a mix of acts ranging from tap-dancing fish to crooning ballards. Vaudeville also had associations with being a little rowdy, comedic, or weird. Later, as cinema came into the picture, the line between live and filmed performances began to blur—this is a technique we are using on The Under stage. In addition to the recorded shows we’ve collaborated on creating with real-life New York artists, players may be lucky and catch a live show as well. Vaudeville was sometimes performed in clubs for small or intimate audiences and could be responsive.”But all of that multiplayer goodness wouldn’t amount to much of the experience of the interactions didn’t facilitate it; Tender Claws has again produced an incredible achievement in interaction design—most notably in how players can move throughout the experience.“Overall the player design is really minimal, and narratively one of the bigger meta arcs through the experience is learning more and more about what you are how you were created,” Gorman said.Like everything the Tender Claws team creates, it approached the subject of locomotion with a commitment to motivate choices from within the game’s narrative and ludological structure.“We knew pretty early on that one of the things we wanted to explore with The Under was a locomotion method that felt tied into the story and didn’t artificially remove you or create a layer of UI on top of the world,” Gorman said. “The narrative was mainly about timeloops and tears in space so it seemed like a good opportunity for the locomotion to try and play into that.”The result was the “scrunch” mechanic—something I suspect will have long-tail impacts on immersive gameplay in the 2020s (and that frankly is just a joy).“We landed on a system where the player could reach out and pull the middle portion of the world towards them: as if reality was a spandex cloth you were tugging on,” Gorman said. “Then when the player lets go, the tugged part stays fixed and the rest of the world snaps toward you. On a technical level, this means that there is always a fixed anchor point in the player’s field of vision. Only half of the world moves at once, first the inner field-of-view, and then the outer, so the player remains grounded.”For those players, the mechanic makes sense—but what happens when you introduce a social, multiplayer aspect to the experience; how will players appear to others in the space?“Once we did this it opened up another question, which is how should this instantaneous ‘blip’ look from the third person perspective?” Gorman said. “We landed on something resembling a blown up balloon that is let go.”But the locomotion was just one aspect of the interaction design among many. Another important development was how players could grab objects—and for that matter, each other.“Another thing we actually put a lot of time into was multiplayer grabbing,” Gorman said. “We wanted to let all objects in the world be held simultaneously by any number of players in a way that felt natural and like you still had a fair amount of control over the object. This led to the players having these weird gooey stretchy arms and good amount of emergent tug-of-war gameplay where you can kind of tear objects away from one another. It also became a way to hold hands with other players as long as there’s an object between the two of you.”Gorman realized this feature could actually allow players to bond with each other in a safe way, when welcome.“To encourage this we also added the ability to send haptic vibration pulses down your arms,” Gorman said, “Pull the index trigger whenever you’re holding an object and all other remote players holding the same object will see and feel a pulse snake its way to them. This plus the snapping above start to develop a vocabulary players can use to communicate creatively.”Still-frame of the snap mechanic in The Under PresentsThe snapping mechanic is exactly what it sounds like—players, at any time, can snap their fingers. This serves a playful, theatrical purpose as much as a narrative one—and is especially handy as a substitute for clapping after performances.But ultimately, the defining features of player interaction are the gold mask on their faces and the bracelets they receive in the first scene. In particular, the mask is the player’s primary “controller” in The Under. “It allows you to control time, become giant, and it’s your ticket into the “Timeboat” experience,” Gorman said. “The mask is also essential to The Under itself; it serves as a base plate for various ritual magic spells. These spells, only hinted at in the single player portion of the game, are something we’re excited for players to experiment with on their own, discover in live actor encounters and teach one-another.”Again, the mask carries interactive, narrative, and metaphorical weight in the construction of The Under Presents—hearkening here to its Vaudeville trappings, thematic focus, and darker narrative undercurrents.“We knew early on was that the character of the MC is trapping these lost voyages and kind of presenting them to the player as if they were a show,” Gorman said. “He is not fully human and takes a very anthropological observation perspective in how he treats the characters stuck in his loops.”The mask becomes an echo of the MC’s agency, allowing players to generate magic, play with time, or see cross-sections of the ship to their exact choosing.“We wanted to present the world with a ship-in-a-bottle or dollhouse perspective, something that the player could peer into and follow characters from room to room,” Gorman said. “We decided that the player should be able to, at any moment, take off their mask to enter this more god-like perspective where they can create a cross-section of the ship and skip around in time to follow the various character storylines.”With all of this in mind, one thing is clear: The Under Presents is one of the most ambitious VR experiences ever made. It not only asks but demands a lot of its players because it wants to offer something uncompromising and distinct.The game is available for $19.99 on the Oculus store today."

(Photo by Sean Gallup/Getty Images)It’s a glimpse of the future. Investors should pay attention.Self-driving vehicles reached peak hype a year ago. Every major technology company, even Apple, seemed to be working on a project.The auto shows were full of extravagant concepts with flat screens and lounge seating. Many prototypes didn’t even have steering wheels. The sleek glass and ultralightweight designs made the idea seem so far off in the future, like some Sci-Fi film.This year, autonomous vehicles are taking the wheel.Waymo has been on the self-driving trek for a decade …As a unit inside Alphabet, the research began when Sergey Brin, Google’s co-founder, splintered off a handful of gifted engineers to work out the math for vehicle automation. By 2012, Brin was promising an operational vehicle by 2017.It turned out Brin was right, sort of.In 2015, Steve Mahan, who is legally blind, became the first rider in a fully self-driving car on public roads. He was grinning ear-to-ear as the test car zipped along the streets of Austin, Texas, using sensors to navigate through intersections and around pedestrians.Technology put Mahan alone in a moving car for the first time in 12 years. But it did not come cheap.The extent of these costs first showed up in 2016 when Alphabet began breaking out the line item expenses for its peripheral investments. The company spent a whopping $3.5 billion on so-called moonshots during 2015 … an 83% increase over 2014.Ruth Porat, Alphabet’s chief operating officer, was sanguine when questioned about the investment in self-driving cars. As a veteran of investment banking, she understood the potential payoff.Automation is not only about watching Netflix or sipping cocktails during the evening commute. The big opportunity is changing the business models centered around transportation.Most passenger vehicles are parked 95% of the time, according to a research paper from Donald Shoup, a professor of urban planning at UCLA. This means most of the time vehicles are in your driveway, or parked at shopping centers or outside at work. Increasing use, even marginally, is a big business opportunity.Taxis and ride-sharing increase utilization rates. However, the golden goose is autonomy.If cars and light trucks were functionally autonomous, there would be no need for individual ownership.The evolution of this model should be extremely negative for automakers and their suppliers, energy and insurance companies.On the other hand, McKinsey & Co., a global business management company, expects the shift to autonomous robo-taxis could be a $1.5 trillion-$2 trillion opportunity.This is a business segment that does not currently exist.The Wall Street Journal reported in March 2018 that Waymo ordered up to 20,000 Jaguar electric SUVs for its driverless fleet. Two months later, the company announced plans to add an additional 62,000 Fiat Chrysler minivans.One of those vans was at the center of the TechCrunch story last week.Ed Niedermeyer, a writer at the online news site, explained that an empty Pacifica minivan navigated to his location near a park in Chandler, Ariz.FRANKFURT AM MAIN, GERMANY - SEPTEMBER 12: John Krafcik, CEO of Waymo, speaks at the opening event ...

And Waymo is still clearly a work in progress. Panigrahi admits to working out the bugs for protocols for emergency vehicles, like pulling over or relinquishing control.However, investors need to be aware these small issues can be resolved, and that fleets of autonomous robo-taxis will happen sooner than later.It’s a big shift that often does not make it to the top of newscasts.

A year later, with holographic runway debuts with The New York Times and Sundance debuts with Poppy under its belt, the studio is taking its first consumer-facing step with the launch of its augmented reality app, letting Android and iOS users bring holograms wherever they are.“The Metastage app is an easily accessible, widely available tool to share volumetric technology with the masses,” Metastage CEO Christina Heller said in an interview with the author. “What really matters, and why we’re most excited about it, is the content that it showcases and the experiences it makes possible.”Volumetric capture—so called because it records video that has volume—is a means of recording fully three-dimensional holograms. At Metastage, this is conducted on a light stage with more than 100 cameras mounted all around the capture area, ultimately producing video content that is stitched together to form holograms. This has made it a natural format for virtual reality because it lets creators capture real-life subjects in full 3D.But where the VR consumer market is still relatively small, there are billions of smartphones that can run AR. Metastage’s app, developed in partnership with Magnopus (the company behind immersive experiences for Pixar’s Coco and Blade Runner: 2049) allows anyone to incorporate these holograms into their daily lives.Heller acknowledges that Metastage is certainly not the first company to launch an AR app—but it is the first with its launch titles: two holographic performances from Laura Rizzotto, an internationally renowned Brazilian/Latvian singer and songwriter. Rizzotto has worked with Demi Lovato, Rosanne Cash, Eumir Deodato and Jennifer Lopez, and garnered international attention for representing Latvia in the 2018 Eurovision Song Contest, the longest-running annual music competition in the world. The song she performed, “Funny Girl,” is one of the two performances to debut on the Metastage app.“An augmented reality app in and of itself is not groundbreaking, but the holographic performance we are premiering with Laura Rizzotto absolutely is,” Heller said. “This is a new way to experience music and your favorite performers.”For Heller, part of launching this app is as a scout mission—a vehicle to experiment and test hypotheses. When she set out to launch the AR companion to the studio, she wanted to go big—something that showcased the strengths of the medium and simultaneously caught people’s attention to drive conversation.And with her background in film and VR—she formerly ran VR Playhouse—Heller was keenly aware that storytelling and creativity are key for sparking ideas around new technologies. So when she found Rizzotto, she knew she’d found an artist who hit all the marks.Cover art for Laura Rizzotto's ""One More Night""“Her voice is incredible, she’s a great dancer, and her songs are incredibly catchy—she is Pop at its best,” Heller said. “When we approached her to do this with us, we wanted to launch with a full unreleased song, and we wanted to go big with it. Because she is independent, she can call her own shots, and we were lucky enough to get the ‘One More Night’ premiere as a hologram on the Metastage app. As a brand new single, “One More Night,” is the world’s first commercial single to launch with a corresponding holographic debut.“I believe the evolution of the entertainment industry relies on finding new interactive mediums to showcase your content and engage with your audience,” Rizzotto said in an interview with the author. “As as songwriter and performing artist, I’m a storyteller. I was inspired by how the volumetric capture technology allowed me to tell my story in an even more personal, intimate manner: by performing right in front of my audience.”Volumetric capture has been making headlines in 2019, notably with the recent scaling of 1RIC studio, whose recent and forthcoming projects were produced at Metastage. But as a form that has only just recently become accessible to creators, even all this innovation we’ve begun to see is just the beginning.Laura Rizzotto created two holographic performances, now available on the Metastage app.Heller explains that artists like Rizzotto are pioneers, taking creative risks by inviting audiences to participate with them in novel ways. These performances, paired with a mainstream delivery vehicle like a mobile AR app, not only showcase how far volumetric capture has progressed, but help those outside the community learn how they might incorporate into their respective industry.“Pretty much anything that is compelling in real life is compelling in volumetric—a song, a dance, a speech, or a sentimental moment,” Heller said. “What’s fun about taking these captures and publishing them through AR is that is allows the viewer to place them in their personal reality. It’s close and it’s intimate.”AR inherently puts the final decisions in the hands of the individual user—there’s a collaborative aspect here that can’t be matched in traditional delivery formats.“For the first time ever, users can tailor the artist’s performance to their own taste and comfort,” said Carolina Rizzotto, who co-produced Laura Rizzotto’s Metastage Experience. “You can take Laura and choose where she’ll perform and even change her capture size. You can make her twice her normal size...or you can even make her the size of an ant and have her perform in your own hand.”Screen captures from the Metastage appWhat’s more, the logistics of capturing a holographic performance is also a new language that performers have to learn—one that they have few examples to learn from. New considerations for what will work in this context are discovered on the fly by artists like Rizzotto.“Usually, whether it is performing for a camera or on stage, there is a specific direction I am performing to, a focus,” Rizzotto said. “For the hologram experience, I was on a green screen stage surrounded by 106 cameras, which were capturing me from every possible angle. I had to keep in mind a specific radius boundary for my movements, in order to make sure my body was fully captured, as well as how my performance would look from various angles.”Unlike with traditional video, performers can’t rely on a final edit or cutaways to massage flubs they might make; Rizzotto had to get the entire choreography right in full, uninterrupted takes.“The volumetric performance of ‘One More Night’ includes an original choreography made for the song,” Rizzotto said. “There is no editing to the performance, as it has to be in one take only, which makes it even more raw.”Rizzotto at Metastage in Los Angeles, CAFortunately, she viewed this as an opportunity to lean into the medium as a means of amplifying the song’s theme and emotional register.“‘One More Night’ is a playful narrative about someone who realized their relationship is bound to fall apart, but keeps postponing the breakup. It’s bittersweet in some ways, but definitely lighthearted,” Rizzotto said. “The unique thing about this experience is how up-close and personal you can get to the artist during their live performance. You [can] either join me on stage and record yourself singing and dancing right by my side, or just watch the show from any angle you’d like.”And Rizzotto confirmed that seeing yourself as a hologram is about as wild as you might initially expect it would be.“It was surreal; I couldn’t believe how accurate it looked,” Rizzotto said. “The technology is incredible.”Rizzotto getting ready for her holographic performance backstage.From an audience standpoint, Rizzotto is excited that this type of capture allows her audience to learn choreographies in a more complete way than they can with 2D video.“I [am] also excited about how the AR medium gives people an opportunity to visualize the choreography of the song in the most complete way possible, due to the variety of angles,” Rizzottto said. “That facilitates the process of learning the song’s choreography immensely, for those who want to dance along.”To ensure that the final product would live up to creative team’s ambitions, they conducted rehearsals to test different options.“Before the actual shoot, we had a separate test day when I rehearsed on the stage and experimented with different wardrobe and hairstyle options,” Rizzotto said. “It was important to see how various colors and textures were captured with this new technology beforehand, to make the best choice for the final project. We did a ‘behind the scenes’ video, which shows all of the steps and details of the making of my Metastage experience.”The video, as well as its corresponding tutorial, was directed, produced, and edited by Carolina Rizzotto:For her part, Heller enjoys that these hard-won early insights allow the young industry to remain exploratory in nature, though she definitely has more ideas in mind for the type of work she’s like to see produced at Metastage.“We’re still in the early stages of this medium so every idea, no matter how strange, is fair game.” Heller said. “So far we’ve done a lot in the areas of music, sports, and healthcare, but even there, just the tip of the iceberg. I personally am excited to do more projects for volumetric preservation of important public figures. We captured a holocaust survivor being interviewed by her son and that will always stand out as a Metastage highlight for me.”She adds that there’s more on the way for the Metastage app.“We’re about to launch a volumetric performance library of stock assets for game engine that we’re calling, simply, ‘Metastage Captures,’” Heller said. “The assets are regular people in regular clothes doing everyday actions like talking, listening, looking around, etc., on short loops.”Whether somebody wants to use these for fun or functionality, Heller is excited that they will be in the world for herself and other creatives to progress the language around holograms and augmented reality.“These assets can be integrated into architectural VR experiences for life and scale, or added to the background of scenes,” Heller said. “There isn’t really anything out there like them, so we are excited to launch this first batch of 50 unique captures, and get feedback on what else creators would benefit to have in the catalogue.”Laura Rizzotto has officially released her holographic ""One More Night"" debut via the Metastage appFor Rizzotto, the opportunity to capture these volumetric recordings was a chance to connect with her audience in a novel way—but she believes that it won’t be long before more artists start working in the medium.“I love finding new ways to expand my creativity and connect with people through my craft,” Rizzotto said. “I’m looking forward to seeing artists get creative with these tools and find new ways to connect with their audience and also to present their content. This technology will reshape the entertainment industry, and this is just the beginning.”The Metastage AR app is available for Android and iOS."

AdChoices · Privacy Statement · Terms ...","Nov 20, 2019,10:31am EST",Still from HoloVista's Autohaus Foyer.,"A brand new trailer from stealthy supergroup teases a gorgeous and truly mixed reality experience.As a journalist, I field pitches about a lot of XR products—often really solid ones—but every once in a while, something comes my way that I can immediately and intuitively can sense will be a big deal for the industry.Encountering Aconite and its debut game, HoloVista, was one of those times. The teaser dropped today:The game is a mixed reality game for smartphones, set to launch next year. Gameplay occurs over the course of a week in a near-future world through the lens—literally—of Carmen, the game’s protagonist. She’s been sent to photograph the inside of an ornate new building at the behest of a mysterious architecture firm called Mesmer & Braid. “As she continues exploring the house, she discovers that the job is not what it seems, and that the firm is up to more than just making buildings,” Aconite Co-Founder Nadya Lev said in an interview with the author.We learn about this world through objects Carmen photographs, the characters she interacts with, and what she posts to social media. Through the mechanic of a fictional social media app, we access lush 3D environments, search for clues, and solve puzzles using gyroscopic 360° views.It’s a novel use of the 360 format, allowing players to access immersive environments (what Lev calls “that magic window into another world”) while simultaneously offering them the same high degree of agency found in mobile games.“In our game, you don’t just look around the 360 environments,” Lev said. “You photograph objects in them, and post the photos to the game’s fictitious social media app. There’s a wish-fulfillment element to that: we’ve all had that moment when we see a gorgeous photo of some exotic location in our feed and think to ourselves, ‘Ugh I wish I could be there, taking that photo.’ Our playtesters sometimes tell us that they feel like they’ve traveled to another place after using the 360 camera. I knew we were on the right track when I playtested the game with a stranger I’d just met in a crowded bar. After she finished the ten-minute demo, she put down her phone, looked around the bar studiously, and said to me, ‘Give me a few moments: I need to adjust back to our reality.’”Doorway at the Autohaus Pool in 'HoloVista'Beyond tapping the zeitgeist, the choice to produce a game this way was motivated by Aconite’s commitment to accessibility in emerging storytelling formats.“It’s important to us that our stories are accessible to all, not just people with the latest or most expensive phones,” Lev said.” The most interesting AR effects require phones with depth cameras, and a lot of people don’t have those yet—especially not teens or those in the developing world. AR’s close cousin, 360°, on the other hand, works on any phone with a gyroscope: that is, most smartphones built since 2011.” As I’ve written elsewhere, I’m a firm believer that, in immersive media, space is a key driver of narrative. As is obvious in early concept art and screenshots, the Aconite team put an incredible amount of work and detail into the environments because they are the core means through which narrative unfolds.“The house is one of the most important characters in our story,” Lev said. “Our amazing narrative designer, Strix Beltrán, initially described it as a ‘a strange ode to post-modernism and Western capitalism, bathed in vaporwave-y aesthetics.’ When we put together the mood board for the house, we were inspired by the opulent gaudiness of MTV Cribs, the eternal elegance of Art Deco, the calculated polish of a well-funded selfie museum, the multiplicative interiors of photographer Sandy Skoglund, and ’90s graphic adventure puzzle games such as Myst.”The Autohaus Foyer in HoloVistaThe final product is testament to an open creative process.“There are three of us working on 360° scenes; [Aconite Co-Founder] Star St.Germain, Blake Kathryn, and Andrew Morgan,” Lev said. “Blake is known for building hyperreal, iridescent pleasure-domes in 3D. When Blake came on board, suddenly our environments began crawling with ferns and vines. A certain hazy, dreamlike glow appeared. Andrew’s personal portfolio has a lot of retro-future neon ’80s vibes. His rooms tend to look sharp, mysterious, beckoning. The artists often do a cohesion pass on each other’s scenes to make it all look like they’re all from the same world, but everyone has their own recognizable signatures as well.”'HoloVista' is slated to launch in 2020The platform behind this game, Aconite—and in particular, its two founders—began the creative process for what would become HoloVista years before it took shape.“My co-founder Star and I are always asking each other: ‘what if...?’” Lev said. “That question is at the core of our collaborations and our friendship. Most often, the subject matter at hand when that question comes up has to do with media, storytelling, and technology. Our questions started out small (the first time was: ‘what if we make a cute parallax website using these hand-drawn illustrations?’), and the questions got bigger over the years.”Aconite Co-Founders Star St.Germain and Nadya LevAs their creative collaboration deepened, this “what if” process took on a more vectored approach. The early success of projects like Lev's Coilhouse and St.Germain's design/development agency, ThisIsStar, led them toward the founding of Aconite, a mixed reality storytelling platform.“By the time we started Aconite, the question was something like: ‘What if we build a place where people can discover and play multimedia stories that are all part of the same giant recursive universe? Stories that weave in and out of people’s everyday life, the places they go, the various platforms they’re on, the media they consume? And what if those stories really blur the line between what’s real and what’s fiction: experiences in which you’re not sure where the story ends and life begins?’For that, the duo turned to emerging technologies.“We found that technology—XR, geolocation, haptics, photorealistic 3D creation tools, etc.—provided us with some roadmaps for achieving our aims, as did certain storytelling traditions: ARGs, role-playing. and immersive theater, to name a few,” Lev said. With these ambitions in mind, it was time for the collective to expand—and they managed to assemble an oddball dream team, with many members offering not only stellar pedigree, but rich, idiosyncratic backgrounds—and Lev is openly excited about each of them.“I love this team because everyone is a polymath,” Lev said. Co-Founder St.Germain’s background in theatre tech, for instance, gave her a unique vantage point in art directing and generally managing HoloVista’s 3D workflow.“Set design and lighting design are all about making a facsimile of a physical space,” Lev said. “You have to be selective about what you represent on stage; you have to pick really potent things to build that facsimile. Scenes need to be legible from afar to the audience, and sometimes abstraction achieves that better than verisimilitude. In other words, a scene needs to be iconic more than it needs to be realistic. Games are like that, too. Star’s background helps her to block out the scenes in our game, and to make sure that the scenes not only look good, but move you through a story.”And it extends deeper into the team’s ranks.The Autohaus Foyer in 'HoloVista'“Our Lead Engineer, Jay Treat, is a prolific game designer in the tabletop world of card, board and role-playing games,” Lev said. “At every phase of the dev process, Jay is asking thoughtful questions that a person from a more traditional coding background wouldn’t think of. Jay is really good at asking the question, “What experience do we want the player to have?” and working backwards from there. Another example: our lead game designer, Scott Jon Siegel, is a veteran of digital games. Scott has designed record-breaking casual games played by millions of people...Scott studied literature in college: they are deeply attuned to the importance of narrative, to making sure that gameplay delivers the story.”While there is no specific release date yet, HoloVista is slated to launch in 2020. As for Aconite, this is intended to be the first of many, from an organization that is somewhat different in structure than typical game studios.“The goal is to eventually have an interconnected universe of games across different media and using various different kinds of tech,” Lev said. “We want to build our own games, and we also want to curate interesting games that other people make. We may not look like a platform today because we currently have only one game title, but that will change. We’re always on the lookout for interesting artists, storytellers, and game-makers who are using XR or other tech.”For more information, visit the official Aconite and HoloVista websites, or contact them via email."
