",It took less than a month for bitcoin (BTC) to erase almost all its gains the market saw in the end of October. ,"At pixel time (15:36 UTC), BTC trades at c. USD 7,684 and is down by 6% in the past 24 hours, by 12% in the past week, increasing its monthly loss to almost 6%. However, the price is still up by 72% in the past 12 months. As a reminder, on October 26, the price even touched USD 10,000 after one of the biggest rally in the Bitcoin's history, when BTC jumped from USD 7,500 in less than 24 hours. However, the price has been gradually dropping since then. BTC price chart:Meanwhile, all other coins from the top 10 by market capitalization are also in red, dropping by 3%-10%. The total market capitalization decreased by almost 10%, to USD 211.6 billion. Bitcoin dominance, or the percentage of the total market capitalization, dropped by c. 2 percentage points, to 65.5% in less than a month.While the market observers can't agree what prompted this drop today, analysts were speculating on Bitcoin miner capitulation earlier this week, while crypto analyst Tone Vays said that he thinks ""we’re going to go lower than USD 7,000 before the halving.""""The crypto market has returned to complete apathy. The Xi boom of October 25th has by now completely dissipated volumes have returned to levels last seen on October 24th,"" Mati Greenspan, Founder of QuantumEconomics.io, said in his newsletter yesterday. ""The important thing to note here is the possible effect of low volume and low liquidity, to which this market is innately susceptible.

","To hit USD 25,000 per bitcoin (BTC), we need to find a way to double the current number of active BTC users, according to co-founder and the Head of Research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, Tom Lee.","In an interview  with CNBC today, Lee argued that BTC will hit USD 25,000 by 2022, which is the number Fundstrat established two years ago as a five-year view for the coin. “It’s quite easy to achieve,” says the analyst. According to the company’s estimates, today less than half a million people ""own and use bitcoin widely today,"" and if that number turns into a million, the price will get to USD 25,000.""Cryptocurrencies are network value assets, meaning, the more people that hold it, the greater the value. In fact, it’s a log function, right? So if you double the users, you get a quadrupling of value. And to go to USD 25,000, you essentially need a 4x rise – a little bit less than that – which means you need to double the number of people who hold bitcoin,” Lee explained.Meanwhile, European digital asset management company, CoinShares Group, in their recent report estimated that, a year ago, at least 139 million user accounts have been created at crypto service providers, representing an estimated minimum of 35 million ID-verified users.In either case, Lee said that the long-term future of Bitcoin is “very bullish.” It’s the early days for digital assets, he explains, and over time it will become institutional and an asset class. “Once we hit that,” says Lee, “it’s actually another hockey stick [-like price rise].”He explained that what we’re seeing here is a log / utility function, and as an example for comparison he took the price return of the FAANG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google) stocks since their IPOs (initial public offerings). “70% of the return is explained by the growth of the global internet in that period of time,” he says, concluding that “it was a log function of the internet’s growth, and that’s how cryptocurrencies are going to work.”Meanwhile, anonymous investor and Twitter user Plan₿, known for his insights into the stock-to-flow ratio, said recently that that the exponential growth in bitcoin's price will continue, and that it will be fueled by BTC’s scarcity dynamics. ""Before Christmas 2021, Bitcoin should be, or should have been, above USD 100 K; if not, then all bets are off and it [the stock-to-flow model] probably breaks down.""Furthermore, Lee said back in June that BTC is just at the beginning of its bull run, that it will easily surpass its all-time-high, and that it can reach as high as USD 40,000 in an unspecified future. In another interview, he also stated that if equities rise, bitcoin will follow – and all-time-highs may be coming soon.In a separate interview with Block TV, published today, Lee said that ""There is a lot of tailwind building in 2020...Incrementally the ball is moving forward and that's bullish.""""There is a lot of tailwind building in 2020...Incrementally the ball is moving forward and that's bullish."" - Tom… https://t.co/uJrA3C9dY2"

November 18, 2019
","There will be a bull run, but not next year, says crypto analyst Tone Vays. And before we get on that road, Bitcoin (BTC) may drop below USD 7,000 before the mining reward halving, he adds. ","“At the moment, I still see lower prices,” said Vays in a recent interview with Block TV.  “I still think we’re going to go lower than USD 7,000 before the halving. But after that, that would be the final secondary low. Hopefully it’ll be higher than the USD 3,000 low back in December. And then we can finally start a bull market after the halving.” If he's right, this means that BTC may drop pretty soon as Bitcoin halving is expected to happen in May 2020. While the halving price has always been factored in, there are still spikes, Vays says. If the price falls lower, there will be another hype cycle going into the halving, he finds. “It’s all about the proximinty of the halving and where the price is,” so if the price were to drop to USD 4,000 - USD 5,000 next month for example, there will be another halving pump, but the price may also stagnate at USD 8,000.However, Vays doesn’t think that BTC will hit its all-time high in 2020. In a year from now, he sees it a bit over USD 10,000. Nonetheless, once that barrier of USD 20,000 is broken, USD 50,000 and USD 100,000 can follow “pretty quickly,” but it’ll not be next year, he says. Instead, Vays adds, “I’m really looking for the bull market to really take off around 2022-2023.”Vays said that he was skeptical about BTC’s recent rally when it hit USD 14,000, when many presumed that it’d continue to climb higher. But in hindsight, he explains, that that big run-up “was caused by the exodus out of the old coin space, Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), Ripple (XRP) – and eventually that stopped,” with not many new people coming in.The big run up for him “was 80% exit out of altcoins, 20% institutional investing,” he explained. “Now that the price is starting to go down, they’re probably not as eager” and will wait for a bottom “because that’s why they’re a little bit smarter.”When it comes to external factors, Facebook's “Libra is not a competitor to BTC” and China doesn’t drive this market that much, the analyst finds – it’s the USD price that still controls everything, as well as the U.S. regulatory environment. “Maybe an ETF (exchange-traded fund) is actually coming. Things like that are very, very bullish for the space – the more comfortable traditional financial markets are with Bitcoin [and] the more regulated products that appear, the better it actually is for the price of Bitcoin,” concludes Vays.However, this past September, Vays admitted that his biggest mistake was being too pessimistic early in 2019:  ""I felt that Bitcoin wasn’t going to rise until there was the death of shitcoins. So I certainly miscalculated that dynamic, I felt that shitcoins would die at the very bottom, so Bitcoin would go closer to USD 2,000 area, and that would kill off the altcoins and Bitcoin would rise from the ashes on its own.”Meanwhile, with the halving approaching, people are discussing if it’s indeed priced in and what effect it may have on the price. According to an analysis by an algorithmic crypto trading platform, Strix Leviathan:Economist and trader Alex Krüger, who shared the analysis, finds that it's possible that BTC experienced greater performance after the previous halving “due to widespread belief in the narrative. But lack of evidence supporting the narrative when examining a broader group of assets indicates bull runs were equally likely the result of other factors,” he says, adding that “the Bitcoin halving will likely be a bullish catalyst. But it may well be not.”However, anonymous investor and Twitter user Plan₿, known for his insights into the stock-to-flow ratio, said recently that that the exponential growth in Bitcoin's price will continue, and that it will be fueled by BTC’s scarcity dynamics. ""Before Christmas 2021, Bitcoin should be, or should have been, above USD 100 K; if not, then all bets are off and it [the stock-to-flow model] probably breaks down.""Meanwhile, as reported, co-founder and the Head of Research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, Tom Lee, believes that if Bitcoin doubles the current number of active users, it will hit USD 25,000 by 2022. In the meantime, Jameson Lopp, Chief Technology Officer of crypto security specialist Casa, started a poll, where 31% of the respondents so far voted that the halving is priced in, and 69% believing it’s “rocket fuel for moon.” People have offered various opinions in the comments, supporting both and neither option, and some thinking that after halving, people will turn to other coins.You'd probably be surprised by how many bitcoin owners don't know about the halvings... https://t.co/N7jvCUmhbpNeither, it affects the price gradually over a prolonged time period both before and after the event.If this halvening doesn't pump $BTC past $20K then we'll see the capitulation of all capitulations.

November 19, 2019
","As the price of Bitcoin (BTC) continues to drop, there’s been talk that many Bitcoin miners will have to start shutting down their machines.","The world’s most expensive cryptocurrency has been getting cheaper lately, dropping below USD 9,000 on November 8, and some analysts estimate it could go below USD 7,000 before its mining reward halving in May 2020. At pixel time (17:27 UTC), bitcoin trades at c. USD 8.152 and is down by 3.7% in the past 24 hours, by 7% in the past week, trimming its monthly gains to 1.7%. The price is up by 59% in the past 12 months.""Because of their large turnover and capacity to hold or sell coins, Bitcoin miners have an outsized influence on the boom-bust cycles of the industry,"" Adamant Capital, a Bitcoin alpha hedge fund, warned earlier this year.  That said, cryptocurrency analyst Charles Edwards thinks that there may be a 60% chance of a miner capitulation, saying that “the extent of this HR [hash rate] growth plateau has never occurred before in Bitcoin's history.” He explained further in his analysis that “The Hash Ribbons 1 month and 2 month moving averages have never been this close - for so long - except during a capitulation event.” It seems that miners are being cautious as they could be deciding between mining more in an attempt to accumulate more, or cutting back hashing power and risk missing a BTC bull run, Edwards explained.Using an indicator he developed, the Bitcoin Difficulty Ribbon, the popular analyst Willy Woo reached a conclusion that we’re witnessing a unique, bearish setup leading up to the halving. “I expect way more volatility,” he says. “Short term bearish is all I'm saying. And don't expect price will repeat past halvenings.”NEVER gone into a halvening in BEARISH price action, miners already capitulating adding sell volume. Historically we front run with a BULLISH setup, miner capitulating only after halvening when revenues are slashed. This is a unique setup. Quite bearish leading up to the event. pic.twitter.com/20748Zv8aQWoo explained that weak miners go out of business when the price goes down, leading to the market bottoming.  This time, it went from USD 14,000 to USD 7,500 “and that's killing off weak miners who are dumping and dying. This adds to the already bearish action, so no happy front running 6-months out due to sell pressure. You can't draw repeat fractals, the fundamentals are different,” says Woo.Another analyst, Cole Garner, also sounded the alarm that there are signals indicating miner capitulation. He explained that capitulations happens when “small miners get backed into a corner when BTC price is low & the generation of mining hardware they use becomes obsolete,"" and added that ""Inversion's likeliest outcome: cash-desperate miners sell BTC gradually...then all at once.” Though we’ve been standing at the edge of an inversion for a historically longest time, inversion is rare, happening only twice in the last four years, he said.MINERS ARE CAPITULATING1/  Hash ribbons is on the brink of inversion. That’s news you never want to hear.Inversion signals a downturn in hashrate. It's a leading indicator of miner capitulation. $BTC is dangling on the edge of a cliff. pic.twitter.com/i1ULrPIKJfGarner mentions five implications:In the meantime, week ago, when we reported that the mining difficulty more than doubled this year, major Bitcoin mining pool BTC.com estimated that the Bitcoin mining difficulty will decrease by another 5% in 10 days leading to the next adjustment, following a 7.1% drop on November 8. Similar scenario was seen last year, when the difficulty dropped 7% in November, then 15% and 9.6% in December. With two days left until the next adjustment is set to occur, the mining pool now estimates that the difficulty will actually increase by 1.21%.

","Changes in China's Bitcoin (BTC) mining policy are not accidental, and competition in the global mining sector might become more intense, says an analyst at Beijing-based token data and rating agency TokenInsight. Moreover, the recent major crypto move by Hong Kong might also increase competition in the local cryptocurrency trading market, he added.","It’s a well-known thing in the Cryptoworld by now that China – though interested in blockchain, with even President Xi Jinping advocating for a faster development of blockchain technology – has taken and is maintaining a tough stance on cryptocurrency industry, particularly exchanges and mining. We’ve written about the country’s discussions on mining ban for a while now, but just two days ago, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) reportedly removed  Bitcoin mining from the list of industries that might be eliminated. Besides that, we know that China is thinking about their own digital fiat, and it was recently revealed that people in the country use WeChat and AliPay  apps to buy crypto with cash.Jack Yang, chief analyst at TokenInsight, finds that it’s not a coincidence that the new catalog for Guiding Industry Restructuring, which excluded Bitcoin mining, was finalized by the NDRC after the President's speech on blockchain. Yang told Cryptonews.com:""It is not accidental, there is a causal relationship. After Xi’s statement on supporting the development of the blockchain, all levels of government have drafted laws and regulations related to blockchains and digital fire coins before the inventory. This revision is also the result of responding to national policies.""Commenting on the meaning behind the NDRC’s recent move, Yang summarized it into three relevant points:“Mining competition is expected to become more intense,” says Yang, while more investments will be coming to China. He explains that this country has always been the center of mining: 70% of Bitcoin's computing power is in China, while major companies in the design and manufacturing of mining machines, such as Bitmain and Canaan, are situated there. “This change in policy will promote the compliance of China's digital currency mining industry,” he said, adding how more compliant, technically stronger companies that have greater capital advantages will wait for an opportunity to enter the industry and promote its further development towards transparency and compliance.Also, as reported, cryptocurrency exchanges can already apply to be regulated by Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), as it published a framework for crypto exchanges this past Wednesday.The chief analyst finds that this “further demonstrates the Hong Kong government's encouragement, support, and at the same time, the decision to simultaneously supervise and promote industry development,” adding that it’s expected for Hong Kong to become “the regional digital currency financial port.” Competition in the industry will be seen here too, according to the analyst, but it will enter a new pattern, with more capital attempting to make its way to the Hong Kong cryptocurrency market. “The addition of giants may accelerate the concentration of this industry,” he says. ""The dividend of financial innovation will ultimately belong to companies that dare to actively embrace supervision, and belong to enterprises that can give up short-term benefits and continue to self-compliance.""Additionally, Yang finds that Hong Kong's securities regulatory system has always been ahead of that of the mainland, and that, for the development of the industry to be guided on the mainland, it’s expected that the internal regulatory agencies will move faster with the introduction of the supervision plans for virtual asset exchanges. “There is currently no trading platform licensed by the SFC, and the impact on the world is not obvious,” he concludes.Nonetheless, Yang finds that the recent development indicates greater acceptance of digital assets as new financial instruments, but also a new course for the supervision of the cryptocurrency sector: from restricted to guided. STO (security token offering) “is the trend of the times,” says Yang, but the regulatory authorities of both Hong Kong and mainland China “should also cater to the development of society and supervise at an appropriate time so as to safeguard the interests of investors.” As to how the industry will progress from here on in both places, Yang said that in the short-term, the regulators are expected to limit the high-leverage transactions such as futures. They will also focus on the regulation of the cryptocurrency trading platforms, regulating the secondary market transactions first, then establishing “risk prevention and control mechanisms through various means, and gradually expand[ing] the scope of supervision,” concludes Yang.As reported, the SFC has also published a warning this week, as they're ""extremely concerned"" about platforms which offer virtual asset futures contracts to the public, especially contracts which are highly leveraged."

the adoption of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. 1. Investment loyalty.","
November 14, 2019
","There are five points that speak to us about the world’s most popular cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) and crypto in general in a global survey by the World Gold Council (WGC), the market development organization for the gold industry.","The new consumer research report encompasses opinions of 18,000 people, across the world, including China, India, North America, Germany and Russia. The researchers have discovered that “gold is a mainstream choice – the third most consistently bought investment, with 46% of global retail investors choosing gold products.”While the report focuses on how to promote gold and bring new audience to its world, all these can be theoretically applied to the Cryptoworld as well, as many Bitcoiners are trying to establish the ""Bitcoin is a digital gold"" narrative. Moreover, the fact that this nascent technology found a place in a major gold-focused survey speaks for itself. Possibly, an ad campaign ‘Drop Gold,’ launched by cryptocurrency asset management firm Grayscale in May, has also made its part.Here are the five things in the survey that tell something important about the adoption of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.The report finds that consumers and retail investors are confident in gold across the world, more so than in their local currencies, with: Also, people that have had an interaction with a product are more likely to buy it, the report finds. 40% of cryptocurrency investors said that they will definitely buy it again, which is the same share as in the case of investment funds, while stocks & shares are slightly less attractive.Moreover, the report showed that more people invested in cryptocurrencies than commodity funds and corporate bonds. It seems that traditional fiat currencies are facing a serious problem of trust, which can help to an alternative form of money - cryptocurrency. Moreover, as recently reported, 29% of surveyed Americans believe that the U.S. dollar is still backed by gold.Also, turning now to those who’ve never purchased a product offered as an option in the survey, we know that people have fears when approaching a new product that would require them separating from their money. The level of this fear and the luck of trust subsequently produced varies across generations, but finding a way to ease people’s concerns would bring more of them to the industry. “People need to trust in how the industry operates. They need to trust the process of buying and selling in a way that fills them with confidence,” the report says. 48% of potential investment consumer and 28% of all potential jewelry consumers cite lack of trust as an obstacle, while more than 25% of those who never invested in gold but are thinking about it, expressed concerns about buying fake or counterfeit products. Though scam concerns are shared in the Cryptosphere, Bitcoin is impossible to counterfeit. Related to the previous entry, those who’ve just joined the game are likely to lack knowledge and experience, which can produce the above-mentioned fear and concerns and prevent them from buying the product – in our case, Bitcoin. Spreading awareness and focusing on successful education will contribute to the growth on trust, and this is something that crypto community has been hard at work on since BTC’s inception. “Awareness of specific investment products, their relative affordability and what drives their prices could be better communicated,” says the report, discussing gold. “Correcting misconceptions and filling these gaps would generate market growth.” 66% of potential gold buyers globally say they lack the necessary knowledge to actually buy it. “Greater awareness of gold needs to be created through TV, print and social media; quality education is required on the benefits of owning gold; and, while it is not a mainstream issue now, the next generation of potential gold buyers need to know more about the industry's ethical credentials.” As Generation Z (born between 1996-2010) is becoming older, it is likely that ethics and environmental impact will become far more important in their purchase decision-making than it has been the case with prior generations, including millennials, which is again a lance in which BTC beats gold, despite heated debates about the environmental impact of the Bitcoin mining. “Awareness of gold does not translate into future buying,” says the report. It turns out that millennials share similar view of gold with the older generations, which is not necessarily surprising given that this generation was born in-between two massively technologically different generations. Younger Gen Zs are showing far less interest in purchasing gold than their predecessors.Younger generations are getting increasingly savvy with everything digital / virtual related, cryptocurrencies included. For example, a significant gateway to the Cryptosphere is gaming. We can say that the generations born after or a few years before the creation of blockchain are growing up with a larger familiarity of digital assets – a first-time phenomenon in the world’s history. The emotional connection of Gen Z to gold is lessening, but their “live-for-today, risk-taking attitude is most evident in their exposure to other investments, rather than in the exclusion of gold,” explains the report, “and one asset stands out as featuring more highly in their portfolios than those of older investors: cryptocurrencies.” The researchers found that, while gold is skewed towards long-term needs, cryptocurrencies are “significantly skewed towards short-term and speculative needs.” 22% of Gen Zs see the role of cryptocurrencies as short-term returns, while 26% see it as speculative and high risk, says the report. Nonetheless, the report shows Gen Z investing even more in crypto than millennials.  “Digital engagement is key to gaining a competitive advantage; potential gold investors want ease of purchase and gold jewellery consumers report that security, trustworthiness and convenience can be major hurdles to purchasing online,” says the World Gold Council, adding that 40% of retail investors name ease of purchase as a crucial requirement when buying gold.There aren’t many “pioneering, tech-savvy players in the gold market,” but if the Cryptoworld has anything, it’s continual innovation. And this is particularly important for millennials, but even more so for Gen Z. “China’s young consumers are growing up in a more technologically advanced society and have an attitude towards gold jewellery that is less traditional than that of older generations,” says the report, and we can safely say that it’s unlikely that future generations will be less digital. If anything, they’re likely to be more so. “Though Gen Zs are more likely to be digital natives, it is not simply that they view gold as old-fashioned in comparison to cryptocurrencies. For them, it is not an either/or, it is something of a different value, both in financial and emotional terms,” the Council concludes.
Meanwhile, as reported, recent developments in global traditional markets and bitcoin's moves complicate the narrative that the price of the most popular cryptocurrency benefits from safe haven capital flows. Learn more:

November 10, 2019
","Depending on who you ask, the Lightning Network will either be the long-awaited solution to Bitcoin’s (BTC) scalability woes or a technological experiment that is bound to fail. Regardless of where your opinion lies, you can currently use the Lightning Network - despite still being in beta - to earn a small amount of bitcoin."," The Lightning Network is a second-layer protocol that operates on top of the Bitcoin blockchain to enable off-chain, low-cost, high-speed bitcoin transactions through a network of bidirectional payment channels called Lightning channels. The primary idea behind the Lightning Network is to take the pressure off the Bitcoin blockchain (or any other compatible blockchain) by processing transactions off-chain and only recording the starting and ending balance on the blockchain. According to the Lightning Network analytics platform 1ML, there are currently over 10,000 Lightning nodes with almost 35,000 payment channels. The network capacity of the LN stands at over 820 BTC (USD 7.3 million). The median base fee for a bitcoin LN transaction is one satoshi (USD 0.00008902).At the moment, the Lightning Network is used for micropayments, such as social media tipping and small online purchases. Large transactions cannot (yet) be processed over the LN. Individuals who run Lightning nodes are able to earn a small about of bitcoin by charging a fee to process bitcoin transactions through their Lightning channels. Alex Bosworth, Infrastructure Lead at Lightning Labs, a developer of the Lightning Network, tweeted in February: “I'm pleasantly surprised that there is now so much activity on Lightning that my own little node is now routing more than USD 10,000/month. [...] I'm getting paid 0.25% for routing.” That means he earned around USD 25 a month for running a Lightning node at the time. As Bosworth’s experience shows, the earning on LN nodes are minimal but as activity on the LN picks up, fee income for node operates may increase. Moreover, LN fees incentivize more users to join and operate nodes to grow the network. Setting up a Lightning node requires technical experience that the average bitcoin user does not possess. Fortunately, for the less tech-savvy, multiple companies, such as ​Lightning in a Box​, Nodl.it and Casa​ are offering solutions that would help start running a node much easier and faster. Coinmine, an ""all-in-one"" crypto device, also aims to start supporting the Lightning Network soon.To earn BTC with your node you need to forward transactions from other Lightning nodes via your node. Sending nodes will look for the optimal path the process the transaction, which means your node’s fee must be set at a level that is low enough so that transactions are routed through it while still generating a profit. Alternatively, you can go with your node’s default setting and see how much you earn. Ensure that your node is funded, by sending BTC to your node wallet address and set up channels with other nodes so that you can start earning BTC by playing your part in the Bitcoin Lightning Network. While you can earn a few satoshis running a Lightning node, it will definitely not make you a bitcoin millionaire. However, that is not the point. As Reddit user, dooglus, who runs a Lightning node, said:“It's best not to think of running a Lightning node as a way of making money, or even of breaking even. It's a way of helping the network and having access to very low fee payments.”"

November 18, 2019
","Disclaimer: The text below is a sponsored article.","It is easy to get carried away by the excitement of the crypto space thinking that your transactions are anonymous. In reality, they’re not despite the fact that Bitcoin was originally made to be used anonymously. These days with mandatory KYC at most cryptocurrency exchanges, it is not too difficult to link Bitcoin wallets to the identity of the owners. This has created privacy concerns among users and necessitated the need to enhance the privacy and security of users. This is why Bitcoin tumblers such as Bitcoinmix come handy in helping keep the transactions on the blockchain anonymous.  A bitcoin tumbler is a service with which transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain are made anonymous. This is especially important because anyone with a copy of the blockchain can follow the movement of all the coins in a wallet. In fact, all the transactions made by a wallet could be viewed to determine its origin and destination wallets. A tumbling service obfuscates these transactions, making it impossible to trace them. The tumbler accomplishes this by sending unique coins different from the ones sent to you to another address. This breaks the connection linking the incoming and the outgoing coins from the mixer, making it impossible to follow. The owner of the coin is untraceable and anonymous.  There are many reasons to use a bitcoin blender such as Bitcoinmix.org. A blender serves as a bridge to anonymity if you’re a user of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Even though blending services may not be available for all coin, Bitcoinmix has the service for Bitcoin and Ethereum which are the two most capitalized coins. Enhanced privacy is the primary reason why you should use a tumbler for your transactions. If you’re making a payment with your Bitcoin wallet for instance, it exposes all your activities (transactions) on the blockchain. This makes it possible for unwanted scrutiny of your financial transactions by bad actors such as hackers. We are aware that sometimes, even exchanges get hacked. This is incentivized by the fact that the Bitcoin blockchain is an open ledger which can be viewed by anyone with a copy of the blockchain or through block explorer. Hackers are able to ascertain that such exchange wallets bear large volume of coins when they breach its security. Exposing your primary wallet to prying eyes could expose you to such risks, especially if you have large volume of crypto in it. When you make transactions, your wallet id is exposed to the merchant, partner or freelancer you’re making payment to but using a tumbler conceals it and keeps your identity hidden. To use a Bitcoin blender such as Bitcoinmix, first choose the coin you want to mix then paste the address of the wallet where you want your funds sent. Next set your custom time (min. 30 minutes), click on the ‘next’ button. This would lead you to the next page where you input the amount of Bitcoin you want to mix, the next field would show the amount you would receive after the mixing service has deducted its service fee. That’s it. Just send the amount you want to be mixed to the mixer’s address displayed, you’d receive mixed coins just like new in your specified wallet."

","Both institutional and retail investments are indispensable if crypto is to grow, but it's likely that in 2020 we'll see different kinds of investment from different demographics. As experts tell Cryptonews.com, institutional investors might become more important next year and are likely to focus mostly on bitcoin, while retail investors will be more open to other digital assets but won't be as active in driving market activity.","Looking back at 2019, it seems that Cryptonews.com was generally accurate in its predictions of institutional investment for the outgoing year, with at least one minor exception.Most notably, experts we talked a year ago predicted that banks, investment funds and other 'institutions' would concentrate most of their investment activities on 'blockchain over bitcoin,' focusing on crypto-related platforms and services, rather than cryptocurrencies themselves. In particular, they suggested that institutions would be especially interested in crypto-powered platforms that enable cross-border transactions and payments.This is mostly true: if you type """"bank invests"" AND ""cryptocurrency"" OR ""blockchain"""" into Google (or perhaps a less privacy-invasive search engine), the vast majority of stories you'll find will relate to banks investing in crypto-exchanges, bitcoin wallets, enterprise or industrial blockchains, crypto-payment service providers, and other crypto-related or blockchain-focused enterprises.Still, while most banks and institutional investors were focused specifically on actual businesses, 2019 did witness a slight increase in pension funds and other funds investing directly in cryptocurrencies themselves.What about next year? Firstly, it's likely that institutional investors – banks, hedge funds, pension funds, endowments, etc. – will show more interest in cryptocurrencies themselves, or at least in bitcoin.""I do see more family offices looking to buy bitcoin for the longer term,"" says crypto analyst and former Wall Street trader Tone Vays.
Crypto trader and author Nik Patel largely agrees. However, he tells Cryptonews.com that, aside from the usual equity investments, much of the focus from institutions will be on bitcoin-related derivatives, such as futures and options. “I expect we will see greater allocation of capital towards cash-flowing cryptocurrency projects by private equity firms, as well as growing volume in bitcoin derivatives markets, as more traditional brokers and exchanges begin to offer an array of regulated products.” While there’s an expectation that institutions will become more interested in bitcoin, Tone Vays, who expects the bull market to take off around 2022-2023, tells Cryptonews.com that he doesn't expect institutions to invest in altcoins, while he also thinks that even buying of bitcoin will be limited, given the under-regulated nature of the space.""Institutional investors should and mostly will only be attracted to bitcoin, I do not see too many institutional investors or traders dealing with penny stocks as they are smart enough to avoid them,"" he adds. ""The same will apply to bitcoin vs shitcoins (aka anything not bitcoin).""That institutions will be investing more in bitcoin is suggested by current trading activity. While Bakkt got off to a slow start when it launched its bitcoin futures exchange in September, it has since witnessed steady increases in more recent months, trading a record 2,469 futures contracts on November 22.Leaving institutional investors, Tone Vays predicts that retail investors will be open to altcoins as well as bitcoin. ""As for the retail investor, there will always be those trading altcoins the way many still trade penny stocks, while complaining about whales. Over time this will be less and less relevant.""Vays expects retail investors to be less prevalent and less important than their institutional counterparts next year. ""I think there will be a bigger interest from institutional investors, but only by default as I do not see any retail entering the space in 2019, to me it felt like the year lost more traders than it gained and I just don't see that turning in 2020,"" he says.While not repeating Vays's claim that retail investors will remain mostly insignificant in 2020, Nik Patel agrees that they'll be more open to altcoins that institutional investors, who will be focusing mostly on established cryptocurrencies.""I think institutional investors will primarily be invested in cryptocurrencies that have a proven track record,” he says, “and if they can find them, cryptocurrencies that generate revenues. I think retail investors, as is their wont, will flock to whatever is making headlines and whatever is experiencing the 'euphoric' stage of its market cycle.""And what will happen in the coming decade? Well, as with long-term weather predictions, forecasts of investment in cryptocurrencies vary widely according to the person making the prognostication and how much skin they have in the game.At the most optimistic end of the spectrum, the likes of Snapchat investor Jeremy Liew and Blockchain founder Peter Smith believe that BTC will reach USD 500,000 by the end of the next decade. According to a report the pair wrote in collaboration, this growth will be driven by a combination of retail and institutional investment, as consumers turn to bitcoin-based remittances, and as funds (and consumers) might turn to bitcoin during times of global political and economic uncertainty._____Tone Vays suspects that we might not see much of this growth until ETFs (exchange-traded funds) are licensed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and other national regulators. “I think an ETF is needed before institutions really get involved in trading,"" he predicts, with certain other cautious commentators suspecting that an ETF won't be accepted until SEC Chairman Jay Clayton leaves office in 2021.Nonetheless, even if we still have some time to wait until institutional investors get really stuck into bitcoin and crypto, Tone Vays doesn't think their reluctance will hinder adoption more generally.""I do not think trading is important at all,"" he says. ""What's important is more people recognizing that they can now start a business without a bank.”“You can hire people from anywhere in the world and pay them in bitcoin, you can sell your product or service anywhere in the world by accepting bitcoin. Creating a well sustained economy by ignoring the banking system will create human freedom the likes of which the world has never seen,"" he concludes.

","The second largest producer of Bitcoin mining equipment, China-based Canaan, has finally completed its initial public offering (IPO) after the third attempt, raising less than estimated. (Updates at 16:30 UTC: updates in bold).","While many have estimated that the company will raise USD 100 million at  a USD 1.6 billion market capitalization, Canaan raised USD 90 million after pricing its U.S. IPO at the bottom of its marketed range (USD 9-11), Reuters data shows. 14 investors indicated an interest in 5% of the shares. The shares started trading today on the Nasdaq exchange under the symbol CAN, making it the first pure-play public equity in the mining industry. In the first hours of trading, the price dropped from USD 12.6, to USD 8.6 per share.CAN price chart:The very first stock on blockchain field over the world, #Canaan will list on #Nasdaq couple hours later, and this… https://t.co/0QfFWGT51oThe company originally filed for a USD 400 million offering in October, and had planned to raise as much as USD 1.5 billion in 2018.""The #2 player in the space, Canaan has shown that it's capable of being highly profitable, with a 61% net margin in the 1Q18. However, its performance is heavily influenced by Bitcoin prices; a price slump earlier in the year caused Canaan's sales to fall 96% in the 1Q19,"" according to Renaissance Capital. Canaan posted USD 177 million in sales for the year September 2018-September 2019.The company, which was founded in 2013, has listed a number of big-name underwriters on its IPO application, including Galaxy Digital and Citigroup, as well as Chinese investors, such as Huatai Securities and China Renaissance.Meanwhile, the world's largest player in this industry, Bitmain reportedly filed confidentially for a U.S. IPO last month, it added."

","The financial world, where cryptocurrencies are trying to change the rules, is becoming even more interesting and dynamic. After social media giant Facebook  launched its unified payment service on Tuesday, personal finance and banking world will allegedly welcome yet another tech giant – Google. While the concerns are raised yet again over centralization, data privacy and surveillance, the Cryptoverse reminds that this can be solved by decentralized cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin.","The world’s most popular search engine plans to partner with banks and credit unions for its new project, named ‘Cache,’ to offer checking accounts to the customers, writes the Wall Street Journal. The new service is allegedly expected to take off sometimes next year. It will include benefits like loyalty programs, but whether or not it’ll charge fees is still being discussed.Caesar Sengupta, general manager and vice-president of payments at Google, is quoted by the news outlet as saying that the company’s approach “is going to be to partner deeply with banks and the financial system,” which “may be the slightly longer path, but it’s more sustainable.”It’s becoming clearer that tech companies are entering the personal finance space at an increasing rate. Some do so to use blockchain and crypto, and others to be their competition, perhaps wanting to become banks themselves. However, another reason may be to gain insight into personal and valuable data. In Google’s case, the accounts will be run by the New York-based multinational investment bank and financial services corporation Citigroup Inc and the Stanford Federal Credit Union. Traditional banks will be the ones in charge of financial and compliance aspects of the accounts, not Google. Nonetheless, skeptics might still complain that the company will likely have the ability to observe customers’ checking accounts, and hence their overall finances and behavior.“If we can help more people do more stuff in a digital way online, it’s good for the internet and good for us,” Sengupta said, stating that Google has no intentions of selling their customers’ data.However, a recent article by the Guardian doesn't help Google's case. The news outlet reports that a whistleblower came out saying that Google has a secret cache of medical data, including names and full details of millions of its users. This person says they work in so-called Project Nightingale – the secret transfer of the personal medical data of up to 50 million Americans from one of the largest U.S. healthcare providers to Google, the article states.In either case, the news of tech giants making moves into/within finance industry doesn’t escape the watchful eye of the Cryptoworld. While commenting on traditional and crypto markets, Mati Greenspan, Senior Market Analyst at eToro, said in his daily newsletter that “now that Apple Pay seems to be in a bit of hot water over allegations on its algos, seemingly on cue two of their long-time rivals have jumped into the payment space today,” these being Facebook and Google. Their announcements, Greenspan finds, “signify they're ready to take the war for payments to the next level.”In Facebook’s case, what remains unclear is whether Facebook Pay “is supposed to be a pilot for Libra or a complete replacement.” In Google’s case, Greenspan comments, “of course they plan to leave the nitty-gritty details to the traditional finance folks."" ""All Google is really interested in is your financial data and for that I'm sure they'll be willing to slap a kickass GUI and possibly a bit of value add as far as fees and rates are concerned,"" the analyst said.Meanwhile, European digital asset management company, CoinShares Group, published a crypto trends report , which includes some  conclusions related to Google and Facebook news. They found that:""When big banks, big tech and big governments join forces on controlling money, then only one realizes the true need for sound money. Bitcoin and gold have never been more important in monetary history,"" Gabor Gurbacs, Director of Digital Asset Strategy at an investment management firm VanEck, said.Meanwhile, Ami Ben-David, Co-founder of Ownera, institutional digital securities blockchain, opined that retail banks will have a hard time competing with Google and fintech startups on overall end-to-end web and mobile user experience: ""Banks must morph into digital institutions to survive.""Similar to CoinShares conclusion, Greenspan also states that Facebook, Google, Apple, Amazon, “all just want to be like Tencent who's been dominating Chinese payments for nearly a decade,” adding: “In fact, the earnings report from Tencent today seemed to contain just as much valuable insight into the Chinese consumer than it did the actual company.”This could be just a middle step before bitcoin.Or it could be the beginning of the endAlso, as reported by Cryptonews.com, a new report by the Bank for International Settlements once again showed that cryptocurrencies are moving in the right direction, as people are increasingly looking for faster and more convenient payments options.On Tuesday, Facebook said it was launching Facebook Pay – a unified payment service that enables users across its platforms, including Messenger, WhatsApp and Instagram, to make payments without having to exit the app. However, Facebook is still fighting regulators over their digital asset Libra, even after stating that the currency will not be launched anywhere in the world without the U.S. regulatory approval.Apple ran into obstacles as well. Unlike Google, they placed their name first when creating their card, seemingly disregarding the role of their partner Goldman Sachs. They’ve also been accused of gender bias, which the company denied. Apple is no stranger to crypto and blockchain world though as they’ve planned their CryptoKit, a framework for cryptographic functions, back in June – when another giant, Microsoft, was developing a smart contract auditing tool – but the company stood against Libra in October, saying that a Libra-like crypto-project was not in the company’s plans. “I really think that a currency should stay in the hands of countries,” Apple’s CEO Tim Cook stated. “I’m not comfortable with the idea of a private group setting up a competing currency.”In the meantime, Google launched a range of new search tools as part of its BigQuery Public Datasets program back in February this year, enabling any developer, entrepreneur, journalist and member of the general public to search and analyze the blockchains of major cryptocurrencies. But already in July 2018, Google added new cryptos to its currency converter."

","Gavin Brown, Senior Lecturer, Finance, Manchester Metropolitan University, and Richard Whittle, Research Fellow in Economics, Manchester Metropolitan University","Many cryptocurrencies have been launched in the past few years, often to great fanfare and celebration, only to fade and fail as the public and investors shun them. According to Coinopsy, which tracks such failures, there are some 1,085 dead coins at the time of writing. That’s a substantial number, even next to the approximately 3,000 still in existence, and senior industry figures expect many of those to fail, too. Why do so many of these projects unravel? You expect many initiatives to come and go in a fledgling market, of course – the 1990s dotcom bubble is the perfect example. But at the same time, cryptocurrency developers have traditionally spent too little time designing the business-use case for their coins and tokens, then only realising after the launch that their idea is yesterday’s news. Time and again, we see launches that copy a previously successful coin – “coin x is the new Bitcoin”, for example. Yet the market already has Bitcoin, and it continues to be in demand – as evidenced by the 18 millionth Bitcoin being mined only last month. We tend to overlook this problem with developers, even while we rightly criticize regulators for not being able to keep up with the fast evolution of the crypto market – despite efforts such as Howey Coin by US regulator the SEC, which was a fake new coin offering designed to teach investors about the risks of putting money into crypto.No doubt these kinds of developer errors will continue. Here are several other themes that we think will have a bearing on future crypto failures:Eleven years ago, the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto quietly revolutionized money with the release of his or her now famous white paper that outlined Bitcoin. In the early years after this vision took off, many of those who launched altcoins and tokens were small teams of developers and leftfield entrepreneurs. They had a clear mission to bring the world of traditional finance and central banks to its knees with decentralized units of exchange that were beyond anyone’s control. A few years on, these bank killers have largely been assimilated by the big financial institutions they once sought to challenge. Wall Street is steadily taking charge of the crypto action, professionalizing trading with the likes of derivatives and futures products. We may now be entering a phase where only large institutions will be able to generate profit from cryptocurrency design. It seems increasingly likely that the next revolutionary white paper will be generated by a global multi-billion-dollar firm – an ironic full turn of events, to say the least. Many other cryptocurrencies from more humble beginnings will fail in future, simply because they don’t have the resources to compete with these huge institutions. They will be driven by sunk costs and the crypto dream to dominate the future of money, but in many cases it won’t be enough. For a cryptocurrency to be successful, two things need to happen: there has to be a reason why people want to use it, and they have to trust it. People will generally trust a coin or token thanks to the underpinning blockchain technology, the decentralized cryptographic ledger systems on which this industry is built. This means that the basis upon which the market judges if a new launch will stand or fall is mainly its use case. There are now altcoins in existence offering everything from new ways to fund web advertising to units of exchange in the gaming world. But more generally, in a world in which it is no longer enough to simply claim to have launched a better Bitcoin, the market’s attention has pivoted towards stablecoins. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that are designed to avoid the wild volatility of cousins like Bitcoin by being pegged or backed by assets like traditional currencies or precious metals. They are designed to encourage people to use cryptocurrency for everyday buying and selling, while also offering a stable store of value for traders on the many crypto exchanges that don’t deal in traditional currencies. Examples include USD Coin and Tether, both of which are equivalent to US$1. The fact that it takes considerable financial resources and infrastructure to make such coins operational is again likely to favour large institutions – witness Facebook’s attempt to launch the Libra stablecoin, for instance. Many investors have lost money through scams in the crypto world. One recent notorious example is the alleged OneCoin ponzi scam, in which investors were promised guaranteed 300% returns for investing Bitcoin or US dollars with a Nevada-based outfit. The money was supposed to be ploughed into foreign exchange options and altcoins, but was allegedly instead used to pay off other investors in the scheme. Fortune magazine recently speculated that OneCoin may have generated losses in excess of the US$19.4 billion (£15 billion) racked up by Bernie Maddoff’s ponzi victims in 2008. Somewhat different was Bitconnect, an exchange in which investors could swap Bitcoin for Bitconnect coins, which would be lent out with claimed returns of up to 120% per year. After longstanding ponzi accusations, the US authorities stepped in last year and the exchange abruptly closed. Bitconnect coins plunged 96% in value, creating huge losses, though they still exist and trade today. An alternative problem is hackers raiding exchanges. The most infamous example is the Mt. Gox attack of 2014, in which over 850,000 bitcoins were stolen and never recovered. More recently the Binance exchange, one of the world’s largest, has been hacked. One other alarming case was that of Gerald Cotten, the 30-year-old founder of Canadian cryptocurrency exchange Quadriga, who died a year ago. Because nobody had access to his passwords, the investments of 115,000 customers worth US$137m were unrecoverable. When a court-appointed auditor was eventually able to access his account, it turned out the assets had all been sold months before Cotten died. We fully expect these sorts of problems to continue – and this shouldn’t be surprising. We are talking about a toxic combination of anonymous technology that is largely unregulated, poorly understood, and cheap and easy to move around the world – and many people willing to kiss frogs in their search for a lucrative prince.This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

","In a few years, perhaps Bitcoin (BTC) fans will think better of the proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, finds Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum (ETH). ","In an interview at the ETHWaterloo 2, an Ethereum Blockchain Hackathon organized by the core ETHGlobal team and volunteers last week, Buterin shared, entering “a joyful heretic mode,” that in five years from now “who knows […] maybe even Bitcoin will be looking at proof-of-stake a little more favorably.” Currently, Ethereum is in the process of switching from the proof-of-work (PoW) system, used by Bitcoin, to a PoS system. However, it's unknown when this change might happen exactly.A lot of cryptos are committed to a capped issuance schedule, Buterin says. They are “really committed to this idea that issuance is evil, and we must have a hard cap, and because a hard cap is the Austrian way, and we must take a strong stance that we are not like those hyperinflations fiat goldbugs.” As reminder, only BTC 3 million left unmined, as well as 120 years to get them all.However, miners must be paid for security, and it is generally presumed that the transaction fees will be used for this purpose, but ""looking at the reality,"" Buterin said, the last time he checked BTC numbers, the daily block reward was about USD 7 million and the daily transaction fees about USD 140,000, which is about a factor of 50 difference, he explains. (Seven-day average of the total value of block rewards paid to Bitcoin miners stood at more than USD 15.6 million on November 10, while they received USD 350,000 from fees, or 45 times less, according to blockchain.info data.) Total value of coinbase block rewards and transaction fees paid to miners, seven-day average, in USD.__Seven-day average, in USD.Buterin then compares Bitcoin to Ethereum, saying that the block reward is about ETH 2 and the transaction fees are usually ETH 0.03-0.28. “Basically, it’s not at all clear that blockchains are gonna continue to be secure […] once the amount going to the security providers, or miners, or stakers, is 50 times lower than it is now,” he says.On the other hand, when he asked the ETH community at a conference if they wanted ETH to have a hard cap, their answer was “universally no,” he claims, as people seem to appreciate a pragmatic approach more, finding it a better idea that “instead of optimizing for predictability of issuance, we're gonna optimize for predictability of security, because the platform's surviving is the most important thing, and if the platform doesn't survive we're all screwed anyway.”The problem is that “we don’t know the ratio of security-to-issuance ahead of time,” which is “a variable a real world has” and something that may take a decade or two to learn about, but Ethereum chose to focus on stabilizing security over stabilizing issuance, which Bitcoin supporters dislike, Buterin finds, but Ethereum supporters are fine with.Buterin believes that PoS does better than PoW with lower-security budgets. “But even with PoS, I'm not confident that Ethereum would prove a stake with zero issuance […] Even past PoS, we are decreasing issuance heavily, but there is still some issuance.” Nonetheless, he finds that even a hybrid PoS is a good way to get more security with lower reward and issuance.While the common opinion seems to be that cryptos will be much more popular in a decade, which will solve these issues, the co-founder of the second largest network by market capitalization believes that:“I think the relative actually matters more than the absolute, and that's an area where kind of the people that focus on the absolute being canceled out by growth of the ecosystem are just wrong.”For the end of this part of the discussion, Buterin clarified that: “It’s not just about Bitcoin, […] I hope Litecoin adopts proof-of-stake as well,” he says. “I hope Bitcoin Cash adopts PoS, I hope Bitcoin Satoshi's Vision adopts PoS. I think the thing is a scam, but I think scams running PoS is still less environmentally harmful than scams running PoW.”Meanwhile, a recent report by Binance Research found that once Ethereum introduces its staking, it will be a game changer as the volume of staking activity “will more than double.” The report stated that currently the increasingly-popular staking accounts for USD 8 billion in crypto activity, while USD 15.4 billion of all crypto tokens can be staked.At the time of writing (15:00 UTC), ETH is trading at USD 188. It's almost unchanged in the past 24 hours and is up 0.7% in the past seven days. Meanwhile, BTC is changing hands at USD 8,766, being down 1% in the past day and 6% in the past week.

",Two men walk into a grocery shop and commit a Bitcoin (BTC) ATM robbery. ,"No, not a joke, but actual news, and – in a twist of irony – an unfavorable example of crypto / blockchain adoption. Apparently, BTC ATM’s have become commonplace enough for your regular, ol’, not-particularly-sophisticated thieves to decide to rob them.The partners-in-crime broke into Simply Delicious Food Market in Vernon, Canada, shortly after 4 AM on Tuesday, local time, and stole CAD 4,000 (USD 3,010) from the ATM, Castanet reports. They broke the glass doors, ran past the register, didn’t bother with the food, drinks, or other available items around them, but instead went straight towards the Bitcoin ATM machine – without any hesitation, as if they knew what they were doing, said the store owner Troy Roland. As the thieves were prying it open, the machine has been heavily damaged, the owner said for the news program.That’s not all, as the duo took two canisters, one each, totaling USD 4,000, but didn’t bother to check the third, the article says, leaving behind CAD 50,000 (USD 37,600) it contained.Though the police arrived 15 minutes after the alarm had been triggered, they just missed the thieves, says the article, though the duo did leave some evidence by which the police is attempting to identify them during this ongoing investigation – namely, the men’s general appearance, the color and type of the escape car (grey Nissan Sentra) and the license plate, all caught on the shop’s many indoor and outdoor security cameras.Because of this robbery, Roland, the owner, says that Simply Delicious Food Market will not be keeping the Bitcoin ATM in the store any longer. This is not the first time somebody went after crypto ATMs. In August, two men in Lynnwood, U.S., caught by the camera entering a mall before its closing time, exiting shortly after, then coming back once the mall closed. Few minutes later, they came out with the entire Bitcoin ATM covered with a moving blanket.Check out the robbery caught on Simply Delicious Food Market's cameras:__Learn more: Number of Bitcoin ATMs Passes 6K Mark…But the Taxman Is Taking Note"

","Always hungry for more proofs that Bitcoin (BTC) is better than traditional, centralized banking, the Cryptoverse just found more examples in the U.S. and Lebanon. ","First, the U.S.-headquartered banking giant Bank of America (BoA) froze the accounts of ex PayPal  Chief Financial Officer (CFO), prompting the Cryptosphere to share similar stories, but also a solution to the issue – Bitcoin. Roelof Botha, a partner at major American venture capital firm Sequoia Capital and former PayPal CFO, tweeted  that after being a customer of Bank of America for two decades, the bank suddenly decided to “fire” him, that is, close his accounts without providing any explanation as to why. In the notice dating November 4th which Botha included in his post, the bank states: “After a careful view of your banking relationship, we’ve made the decision to close your account above,” adding that the decision is final and won’t be reconsidered. After being a customer of @BankofAmerica for 20 years, I received this notice today that they decided to fire me as… https://t.co/XhF8HYbJFS""(The Biggest US commercial Bank) Unbanked the banked (Sequoia partner),"" reacted Dovey Wan, a founding partner of California-based investment company Primitive Ventures. BoA was not available for immediate comment.“Bye Bank - Hello Bitcoin!,” replied one Twitter user to the news. CEO of Civic Vinny Lingham joined as well, asking “Did you buy any Bitcoin?” With people thinking that this is “Legacy finance digging its own grave” and that traditional banks are a joke, many indeed are suggesting using Bitcoin as a solution for these issues caused by the centralized banking authorities. The CEO of Bitcoin will never send you letters...Other major characters in the industry joined the conversation, such as Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, and Tron CEO Justin Sun.""Bitcoin never fires you,"" said the CEO of Binance and was immediately reminded that the company ""fired"" all their customers in the U.S. in September for more than 10 days. ""Me too. I have been a customer of Bank of America for 8 years and get fired as well,"" Sun chimed in.Meanwhile, lawyer, blockchain enthusiast Preston Byrne warned that ""If BofA will do this to a partner at Sequoia and former CFO of PayPal, they'll do it to anyone.""""Banking and payments are a civil right. There should be a law,"" he stressed.It’s not the first time something like this happened, as many people shared their stories too, such as that of K9Venutures. Bank of America allegedly closed its account in January after a decade of business with them, based on a ""determination that this is a business type we have chosen not to serve.”Other people, however, have been evoking a sort of a karma here, saying that after a number of years with PayPal, this online payments giant simply cut them off, no explanation provided. Some claim that the company even withheld personal funds for a while: “Paypal closed my business account, and kept USD 5000 for 6 months. No explanation, no one to discuss with,” said Sarfaraz Rydhan. As previously reported, PayPal stopped payouts to Pornhub performers, also prompting the Cryptoworld to call people to solve their banking issues by using crypto.Meanwhile, as Reuters reported, after being closed for most of the last month amid a political and economic crisis that led to nationwide protests, the Association of Banks in Lebanon came up with a set of temporary directives for commercial banks, which includes a USD 1,000 cap on weekly withdrawals from U.S. dollar accounts. People have been pointing out that this too is a perfect example of why banks are not to be trusted with one’s funds, but also that ""Bitcoin solves this.""Banks in Lebanon will finally allow you to access your own money after being shut down for a month!Bitcoin never shuts down! 🚀Not sure how some people still cannot see any use or value behind it? 🧐 https://t.co/fyG5cPBE82"

",A New York City-based real estate owner and developer sold a retail condo in Manhattan’s Upper East Side for bitcoin (BTC).,"Ben Shaoul, the president of Magnum Real Estate Group, a residential real estate development and management company, has sold a retail condo for USD 15.3 million in bitcoin, The Real Deal reports, citing ""a person familiar with the deal.” The 11,400-square foot (1,050 sqm) apartment was allegedly bought by a Taiwanese entity, Affluent Silver International LLC, using crypto payments processor Bitpay and Starr. Eric Hedvat, a broker who represented Magnum, is quoted as describing the transactions as a “seamless process.”The classy Upper East Side is known as the home of many of the wealthiest New Yorkers and a number of world-famous sites and institutions. It’s no wonder then that an apartment here would cost you an arm and a leg, regardless of the currency you own. However, New York-based real estate professionals are joining the world of increasing adoption of cryptocurrencies, in particular of the most famous crypto, giving the customers one more payment option.Though the wider adoption of crypto is stunted by its volatility, the article finds its use to be increasing in the real estate industry. This example is far from being the only real estate-for-BTC sale by Magnum, Shaoul, or others in Manhattan or other parts of America for that matter. Magnum’s president is quoted as saying two years ago that BTC will be a game changer and that people, already back then, were calling to ask about purchasing an apartment with BTC. Last year, Shaoul went into contract with two buyers of two rental-to-condo units:  a 624-square-foot studio with an asking price of USD 875,000, and a 989-square-foot one-bedroom with an asking price of USD 1.48 million – to be paid in BTC via BitPay.Meanwhile, back in 2014, the Wall Street Journal reported that a “Silicon Valley entrepreneur” bought a 1.4-acre (0.57 ha) Lake Tahoe property for USD 1.6 million. He paid for it with BTC 2,739 via Bitpay. At the time, in early August 2014, BTC traded at c. USD 580. This amount of BTC would today be worth USD 23.8 million. Furthermore, in 2017, the Los Angeles Times reported, somebody bought a mansion in Manhattan Beach for USD 3.225 million with c. BTC 3,300. “Had he waited a year,” the article says, “that same number of bitcoins could’ve bought multiple beach houses, a few penthouse condos and a private island in the Caribbean.”At the time of writing (10:46 UTC), BTC trades at USD 8,725, having dropped 1.61% in the past 24 hours and by 5.7% in the past seven days. It's up by 37% in a year.

","Jesse Powell, CEO of major U.S. cryptocurrency exchange Kraken, believes that the hype surrounding altcoins in the Cryptoverse is at its dying breath. ","“Altcoin hype has largely died off,” said Powell in a recent interview with Ivan on Tech, a popular YouTuber. He explained his view by saying that a vast majority of the altcoins, “probably 99%” of them, are down by some 95% of their value from their all-time highs. Instead, people have refocused on the top few high-potential, high-quality projects, he says.“I think that people have kind of realized that most of these altcoins are really seed-stage startups and, you know, most startups fail,” Powell says. As for the issues that people get burned by, or reasons that will lead to this failure of the majority of projects, the CEO mentions “tons of terrible stocks in the public stock markets,” and says that “a lot of the incentives are screwed up” with ICOs (initial coin offerings), where “founders got paid millions of dollars before they even delivered a working product and, you know, maybe now they're not really incentivized to continue building.”Kraken now offers 30 digital assets to its clients. In regards to Bitcoin (BTC), he says he never recommends shorting BTC. He added that Kraken has “way more demand to go long Bitcoin, but we’ve only got so many dollars in the system. The margin pool for borrowing dollars to buy Bitcoin is constantly being exhausted, which I think is good. People are bullish.”Powell also said that a lot of people coming into crypto, do so through video games – especially young people nowadays, who don’t even have a bank account, are familiar with digital / virtual value and currency.Meanwhile, popular crypto researcher and analyst Willy Woo took to Twitter to post about the top 50 coins by trading volume. ”Below the top 40 doesn't even register i.e. 4938 coins are illiquid,” says the analyst. He added that “very few coins"" have credible liquidity to make good investments, and what investors want is exactly liquidity “at entry [and] on exit.” This is the chart Woo provided to back up his claims.Some, however, believe that these projects are still too young. Erik Voorhees, founder and CEO of the crypto exchange ShapeShift, replied to Woo, saying: “Put Bitcoin from 2012 in there. Most of these projects are only 1-3 years old.”So is Tether, EOS, Bitcoin Cash, Neo and Ethereum is also very young. My point being all coins ride on Bitcoin’s Halo Effect, so being young is no excuse. It’s a different time in the industry than 2012.Learn more: This is Why Dogecoin is Better than 'Altcoins-Degenerators'Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple, also said recently that ""there are too many"" crypto assets and ""99% of crypto probably goes to zero.""Meanwhile, in September, Kraken admitted it was cutting 57 jobs. Powell allegedly said at the time that the job cuts were a cost-saving measure that will have no impact on the quality of Kraken's service. Later that month, Dan Held, Director of Business Development of the company, told Cryptonews.com that the exchange is planning a “major change” soon, as improving user experience is one of the main focus areas in the company this year."

","Change in global and local regulations was again chosen as the largest driver for the cryptoasset industry, a survey by Binance Research showed.","The research arm of the major crypto exchange Binance conducted their second survey, distributed to their large institutional and VIP clients. The survey included 76 participants, English and Mandarin speakers, most of which are firms, funds, and institutions with allocations to cryptoassets ranging from USD 100,000 to more than USD 25 million, while 54% of respondents keep their cryptoasset investment/trading portfolio between 1 and 10 coins.Out of that sampling of client respondents, 60 have each selected three from the list of twenty growth drivers, after which the researchers finalized the list of six growth drivers for the future of the cryptocurrency and digital asset industry:The report states that, in both surveys (in June and October) the respondents ranked regulations as the top potential growth driver, as well as the most considerable risk driver. However, among the features that the respondents didn’t find particularly relevant as growth drivers, receiving fewest votes, the report lists privacy features, staking solutions, private blockchains, security tokens and decentralized exchanges, respectively. On the other hand, when it comes to the largest risks, 48.3% of the 60 respondents have chosen platform-specific failure, such as hacks, followed by Tether’s legal issues (43.3%). Libra and CBDC found themselves on the list of the lowest risks, contrary to what one might deduce given the ongoing regulatory scrutiny and debates.The report also made a few forward-looking comments. The price predictions by the respondents for the three largest coins by market capitalization (given in October, for the period until December 31) were bullish, says the report, but adds that “these predictions remained quite conservative in their magnitude for an industry as volatile as the digital asset one.” On the other hand, Bitcoin market dominance median prediction was some 69% (compared with 65.5% today), which means that they had higher expectation for it by the end of the year in October than in June. “This echoes the fourth largest risk to clients, who quoted the lack of retail interest in the altcoin market as one of the critical risks for the development of the cryptoasset industry,” Binance Research concludes. Other findings in the report include:"

","The Royal Bank of Canada (RBC), the Canada-headquartered major global bank, is set to open a cryptocurrency exchange, according to a report from The Logic.","Updated: RBC Says It Has No 'Near-term Plans' to Launch Crypto ExchangeThe media outlet claims it has learned that the RBC wants to allow customers to trade in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum for investment purposes, as well as providing a platform for in-store and online crypto purchases.The bank also reportedly plans to include offering customers cryptocurrency bank accounts, although the media outlet says RBC has not responded directly to request for comments about the proposed exchange launch.RBC has registered four cryptocurrency banking-related patents in the United States, and has been exploring possible blockchain technology banking applications since 2017.One of the accompanying texts filed with the patent paperwork read as follows, again per The Logic,“To individual users, managing cryptographic keys and transacting with different cryptographic assets can be a challenge. In some situations, cryptographic asset transactions may take time to be confirmed, and/or may not be compatible or supported by merchant systems or point-of-sale devices.”""I can’t think of one of the big banks anywhere in the world that has a patent that directly relates to a crypto exchange,"" Marc Kaufman, a Washington, D.C.-based partner at Rimon Law, was quoted as saying.Meanwhile, earlier this year, David McKay, CEO of RBC, said that the bank is experimenting with blockchain for tokenization, perhaps even private equity: ""Blockchain is an opportunity in the future to take assets that are less liquid and make them more liquid. I think that’s exciting."" Should the RBC go ahead with the crypto exchange launch, it might immediately become the most prominent domestic exchange in the sector – and a very major international player. Per the bank’s most recent quarterly report, its net income for Q3 was USD 2.5 billion, while its quarterly revenue was USD 8.7 billion. It had more than USD 1 trillion in assets at the end of Q3.The RBC also claims it is one of the top 15 banks globally based on market capitalization. As well as its Canadian operations, RBC says 23% of its revenues come from its activities in the United States, and 15% from elsewhere in the world.And the bank says it employs more than 86,000 staff members, with a client base of over 16 million."

","Alameda Research, a quantitative trading firm and parent company of cryptocurrency derivatives exchange FTX, finds that anonymity can be sacrificed for a marketing opportunity. ","The firm decided to have its trading performance posted on BitMEX exchange's leader board under their real name back in early 2019. They wanted clients and other exchanges to better know the firm and its products, particularly the newly launched over-the-counter (OTC) trading desk, as well as FTX which was about to be launched, writes Bloomberg. “Exchanges all knew who we were, they saw our volumes; but other people didn’t,” explained Sam Bankman-Fried, Alameda’s co-founder and CEO. He also pointed out that getting listed on the leader board helped the company’s OTC gain “more clients than expected” and reach trading “in low eight figures a day” and “a few hundred millions of dollars of derivatives a day.” The CEO added that Alameda, founded in 2017, handles c. USD 1 billion in trades daily, which accounts for about 5% of volume worldwide, and they are on the fourth spot on the leader board, behind anonymous traders Heavy-Autumn-Wolf, Mercury-Wood-Sprite, and Quick-Grove-Mind. However, when combining their both accounts - Alameda Research and alamedaresearchltd[at]gmail.com - the company jumps to the second spot, with the total profit of BTC 6,941 (USD 60 million).The following shows some of the most profitable traders on BitMEX.__Speaking of safety, Bankman-Fried said that the firm had internal discussions whether there are countries he shouldn’t visit, due to concerns about kidnapping and extortion. Meanwhile, Lex Sokolin, global financial technology co-head at blockchain company ConsenSys is quoted as saying that “For those companies that manage money, the leader boards can act as a type of track record that could be used to market their own services,” adding: “While not as rigorous as an audited track record, it is still better than nothing.”When Alameda just begun, one of its earliest trades, says the article, was taking advantage of the over 30% premium for which Litecoin (LTC) was selling on the major cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, whereby the company would sell LTC bought elsewhere at the premium. There are two rules that the company still follows despite their fast development: Meanwhile, as reported previously, FTX has been sued for market manipulation and selling unlicensed securities in the United States, with the parent company calling the lawsuit a “nuisance” and claiming that there was no wrongdoing on the exchange's part. The plaintiff is seeking USD 150 million in damages, claiming FTX launched an attack on Binance in September and used accounts to manipulate Binance’s Bitcoin futures. “When we get targeted for things, it’s a function of our increased brand size in crypto,” Bankman-Fried is quoted as saying."

And could South Korean blockchain firms provide a catalyst for change?,"In the past few days, Ho Chi Minh (HCM) City authorities have stated that they will “develop a blockchain infrastructure” to power smart city construction initiatives, claiming they would use blockchain to “mitigate risk and streamline processes,” per Vietnam News.HCM’s High-tech Park tech incubator has also sealed a deal with South Korean firm CBA Ventures, who will provide tech support and blockchain training.Another South Korean company looking to do business in Vietnam is cryptocurrency exchange Bitsonic, per News1. Leading South Korean exchanges such as Upbit and Coinone have previously launched trading platforms in Indonesia and other South East Asian nations.Bitsonic says it will partner with Innovantech, a Vietnamese blockchain firm, and says it plans to launch the exchange, which will be named M2Bit, in the first quarter of next year.The companies say they will work with Vietnamese bank Techcombank, and plan to offer crypto to dong (Vietnamese fiat) pairings.Van Nguyen, a Hai Phong-based accountant, told Cryptonews.com,“People have noticeably started talking about blockchain and cryptocurrencies in a more positive light in recent weeks. The mood is upbeat during these discussions. I don’t know if that’s because of developments related to the Chinese government and South Korean companies or not. But we do pay a lot of attention to tech developments in both countries.”While regulation continues to hinder the progress of blockchain and crypto companies in South Korea, a number of firms are looking elsewhere in Asia, developing expansion plans in Vietnam.HCM’s blockchain move comes as the central government steps up its own blockchain game. The country’s Ministry of Science and Technology says that a new SME accelerator project will “give priority to blockchain startups.”HCM officials also spoke of “working with agencies to build a roadmap for the application of blockchain in the country.”In September, the Korea Times reported that South Korea’s NEEO Apps had joined forces with a Vietnamese firm to launch the Exvina crypto exchange, while blockchain firm Sigma Chain is also active in Vietnam. The newspaper added, “Korean blockchain companies are rushing to Vietnam to find business opportunities and new revenue sources in the Southeast Asian market.”"

","A court in South Korea has jailed the head of cryptocurrency exchange Coinup for 16 years, after convicting him of fraud. Eight other executives from the exchange were also given jail time, with the company’s vice president given an 11-year prison term.","The Seoul court ruled that Coinup’s CEO, “Cash Kang” (real name Kang Seok-jung), was guilty of cheating hundreds of investors out of a total of over USD 386 million in one of the most audacious cryptocurrency-related fraud schemes in South Korean history.As part of a campaign that began in 2018 and was shut down by police in February this year, Kang and his associates created fake images featuring massive overseas data centers, a fake video and English-language news platform – and even photoshopped and distributed a picture of Kang standing next to a smiling South Korean President Moon Jae-in onto the cover of bogus magazine, per Ilyo Seoul.The company made bold promises about the lucrative rewards its investors could expect, and even received mainstream media coverage when Coinup organized a meeting for potential investors at South Korea’s leading convention center, the COEX in Seoul, at an event with an estimated 5,000 attendees.However, the court also hit out at the investors, stating, per Yonhap, “The victims are also responsible for the scale of the damage. They investing excessively in the hope of obtaining high returns over a very short period of time.""The police investigation saw some 60 Coinup employees arrested. Of the six subsequently charged and found guilty aside from the CEO and vice president, the court handed out jail terms of six to nine years.The court heard that Kang and his associates used investor funds to make a series of investments in seemingly worthless tokens, and awarded themselves a healthy share of the money they received.Despite amassing some USD 386 million, MBC reports that the police were only able to seize some USD 258,000 worth of assets from Coinup.The presiding judge told the court that Coinup’s scam was “highly organized and paid great attention to detail."""

",Cardano (ADA) chief Charles Hoskinson has hit out at the Stellar Development Foundation (SDF)’s recent decision to burn 55 billion XLM tokens – worth some USD 4 billion at the time. ,"Hoskinson stated that the move has created little in the way of value for Stellar – and claimed that the funds should have been invested in development.In an ask-me-anything video live-streamed on his YouTube channel earlier this week, Hoskinson was asked whether he considered that the SDF’s decision had been a mistake. He answered,“What value did [the token burn] create for Stellar? There was a short-term price appreciation that the markets took back. And they've permanently lost all that value that could protocol development, or for community development.”Hoskinson claimed that the SDF had prioritized short-term gains, at the expense of the protocol’s integrity. He also opined that token burns were intrinsically a bad idea.He stated,“It’s like basically saying, ‘I can’t figure out what to do with this big pile of money, so I’m just going to set it on fire to make money scarcer, to give a small gift to everybody. It’s insanity. Burns never work – they’re market manipulation in the short-term for speculators at the expense of the future of the protocol.”""Stellar isn’t mined, so the lumens now in public hands are there because we’ve worked hard to get them there over the last four years. As for the other two allocations, in time and after a lot of thought, we’ve come to realize they’re too large. SDF can be leaner and do the work it was created to do using fewer lumens,"" the Foundation said at the time. XLM prices rocked up to just short of 19% after the burn, but the token has gone on to suffer along with Bitcoin and other leading altcoins during the most recent price tumble.At pixel time (08:30 UTC), XLM, ranked 10th by market capitalization, trades at c. USD 0.059 and is down by 6.5% in the past 24 hours, by 19% in a week and by 5% in the past month. The price is also down by 70% in the past 12 months.XLM price chart:Meanwhile, in July, major crypto exchange Binance, said that its team “will not spend a penny” of its allocation of BNB tokens. Instead, all tokens allocated to the team (worth USD 2.4 billions a the time) from the initial coin offering (ICO) back in 2017 “will be burned.” Various commentators suspect that Binance might have more than one ulterior motive in pursuing its token burns."

","Tron (TRX) prices are up on the news that the company’s CEO Justin Sun is indeed an investor in the Poloniex exchange, which started accepting limit orders for TRX/BTC, TRX/USDT and TRX/USDC yesterday.","Hour-by-hour Tron rates were still in the green at 6:10 UTC, with 24-hour prices above the +1.5% mark, while almost all the  top 10 coins are in red. Tron still sits just outside the top 10 coins per market capitalization, however, behind tenth-placed token Stellar – despite a monthly price growth rate of over 17%.TRX price chart:In a live-streamed video hosted by Poloniex, Tron’s Justin Sun stated, “I don’t own Poloniex […] but I am one of the investors who are helping Poloniex to grow.”Sun added that Tron was planning a wide range of Poloniex-related collaborations, including a token giveaway for Poloniex users. He noted that further details would follow in the coming weeks.Poloniex announced it would be listing Tron earlier this week, amid reports that its new owners want to boost the platform’s presence in Asian markets. After the exchange started accepting limit orders for TRX/BTC, TRX/USDT and TRX/USDC yesterday, full trading of TRX should be enabled soon.Sun also described his first encounter with Poloniex, stating that a friend advised him to buy Ethereum (ETH). At first, Sun says he was concerned Ethereum was a “scam coin,” but eventually decided that it was above-board. But when he decided to buy tokens, he found that the only exchange that listed ETH was Poloniex – a fact that led him to open an account on the platform.Sun described Poloniex as “one of the biggest exchanges in our industry.” (Ranked 76th by trading volume - USD 27 million in the past 24 hours, according to Coinpaprika). Poloniex’s star has waned somewhat since its inception and meteoric growth in 2014. The platform was sold to Circle last year. The American company has since spun Poloniex out, with an unnamed group of investors taking control.The Tron chief had seemingly distanced himself from the Poloniex sale, stating “I am not buying anything” at the time, although he added that he had “invested some” and was “helping out” his “friends.”Sun also explained that there would be a way for Chinese traders to use the Poloniex exchange, adding that they would have to access the site via a different web address."

November 17, 2019
",Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) achieved mainstream attention in 2017 following the popularity of the crypto collectibles game CryptoKitties. The NFT market has evolved since then. ,"In this article, we will delve into non-fungible tokens to understand what they are and what they can do. We will also explore what has been happening in the NFT market throughout 2019.Fungibility is defined as the quality of a good or commodity that makes its individual units interchangeable with another unit of the same commodity with the same value. It is considered an essential feature of any viable currency or item utilized as a store and transfer of value.Fiat currency presents an excellent example of fungibility. The currency in your wallet is acceptable everywhere. Fiat currency, say 100 dollars, in a large denomination is exchangeable for five 20 dollar notes. Likewise you can choose to pay for a good or service with your 100 dollar bill or in smaller denominations. This is fungibility.Fungibility is considered one of the most important characteristics of a currency. Digital currencies are a mixed bag with regard to this feature. Some cryptocurrency networks, like Bitcoin, started as fungible but the open nature of its ledger combined with leaps in blockchain analytics technology have made fungibility a distant memory. However, some digital currencies, those with significant privacy considerations such as Monero, leverage technology that imparts their tokens with fungibility. Fungibility is important for currencies because it allows it to meet the society's needs effectively. While fungible items serve a purpose in society, the same is true of their opposites too. Non-fungible items are those which cannot be interchanged with any other good. Non-fungible assets are typically items of high value that are rare. Examples of such items are paintings or other valued art, precious stones, and other collectables, like baseball cards.Non-fungible items operate on the scarcity principle. In social psychology, this principle explores and explains how the availability of an item affects its valuation by members of the public. The rarer an item is, the more money people are willing to part with to acquire it. Human beings have been attaching meaning to items that do not possess any inherent worth since time immemorial. Other reasons, such as religion and sentimentality, can also have an effect on the valuation of an item. A good example is the Gutenberg Bible, which is worth upwards of USD 4 million because of its historical and artistic value. In the context of digital assets, non-fungible tokens are made possible by blockchain networks that support the creation of decentralized apps (dapps) through the deployment of smart contracts. NFTs are unique one-of-a-kind tokens, sometimes representing another real-world item, which are deployed on a blockchain network. It is important to note that most NFTs do not have to represent items in the real world. In fact, the majority of the NFTs in existence represent assets that only exist in their crypto-ecosystem. NFTs possess characteristics that distinguish them from the rest of the cryptocurrency sector. These tokens are unique as a function of their rarity. Additionally, they are a scarce asset class. The maximum supply of any type of NFTs is usually predetermined and capped at a certain quantity. Additionally, because they are typically deployed on blockchains, NFTs are readily accessible to anyone with an internet connection. The use of blockchain technology ensures that the tokens will exist after the life of their creators. Moreover, it is possible to design and launch entire ecosystems around NFTs, which can interact with each other in many novel ways, thanks to the blockchain. The Ethereum-based dapp, CryptoKitties, which brought NFTs to the forefront of the crypto community in 2017, capitalized on digital scarcity. In the cryptocurrency world, just as it is in the real world, people want to own things that only they or very few others have. The virtual kittens deployed on the Ethereum blockchain gained popularity in a short time leading to much slower speeds for the network, significantly affecting the Ethereum network negatively.Following the CryptoKitties craze of 2017, NFT projects mushroomed in number. Most projects employ the ERC-721 standard designed by Dieter Shirley to deploy their NFTs, making Ethereum home to most NFT projects. However, other smart contract platforms such as EOS are also increasingly being leveraged to launch NFTs.""We believe there is strong growth potential in NFT, and that the NFT space in 2019 is like the crypto space in 2014,"" Bobby Ong, Co-founder of major crypto market data provider CoinGecko, told Cryptonews.com earlier this year.While Ethereum has dominated the NFT standard for the last couple of years, developers at EOS recently released two new standards for non-fungible assets on their blockchain. The standards were published by two different projects namely, Simple Assets by CryptoLions and dGoods by Mythical Games. The deployment of these standards is an attempt by EOS to dethrone Ethereum as the king of the NFT market.According to StateoftheDapps, there are 26 NFTs in existence in the market. While DappRadar lists 68 crypto collectibles. Also, while many NFTs are deployed in the context of gaming, there are some NFT projects which are marketplaces or for use on social networks. On the other hand, Ethereum continued to expand its NFT dominance. The Ethereum Name Service is a recently launched innovative project. It is designed to provide users with human-readable domain names deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. To make this possible, developers are leveraging using NFTs to represent the unique domain names generated by users.Moreover, a number of NFT marketplaces have sprung up over the past two years. The largest of these is OpenSea. It was launched early 2018 and typically trades about 50-150 ETH in NFTs daily. Auctionity and Rare Bits are other NFT marketplaces.Lastly, NonFungible.com published a report analyzing some of the biggest names in the market. The report found that while extensibility, the ability to interact with other ecosystems in a gaming environment and one of NFTs biggest unique characteristics, is not being utilized as much as was previously thought.  Through analyzing on-chain gaming transactions over the course of the year, Nonfungible.com found that 91% of wallets have only interacted with one game since January 2019. This may represent a bit of a challenge to the billion-dollar gaming industry, which is quite enamoured with NFTs due to the possibility of extensibility."

","Virtual asset service providers (VASPs) just launched the OpenVASP initiative that aims to solve one of the biggest regulatory challenges, known as the ""travel rule.""","As a reminder, the rule necessitates that VASPs share customer info with each other, so that one exchange can confirm, for example, that a customer on another platform it’s sending 10 bitcoins to has a verified identity.Today, at the Blockshow Asia conference in Singapore,  Swiss-based Crypto Valley Association (CVA), International Digital Asset Exchange Association (IDAXA), ACCESS Singapore Cryptocurrency and Blockchain Industry Association along with key industry partners announced OpenVASP.""The initiative will enable VASPs to transmit blockchain transaction information privately, immediately and securely, in compliance with the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Recommendation 16, also known as the travel rule,"" according to a press release.A whitepaper that proposes an OpenVASP protocol ""based on key design principles of decentralization, privacy, broad applicability, while remaining agnostic to the virtual asset being transferred,"" has already been prepared.The protocol would allow VASPs from across multiple jurisdictions to transact between themselves without necessarily knowing each other and without the need to register with a central authority or database, the announcement added.“OpenVASP is a roadmap to FATF compliance that enables VASPs to protect private and business-sensitive data. We hope the community will consider it as a blueprint. Building partners are welcomed,” Chris Gschwend, Head of the CVA’s VASP / AML Taskforce, was quoted as saying. The travel rule is ""almost like applying U.S. postal mail rules to email for U.S. communication roles. Like pushing a square peg into a round hole for us, the blockchain ecosystem,” Tim Byun, a former regulator, now CEO of crypto exchange OKCoin, told Cryptonews.com earlier this year.Meanwhile, Carlos Domingo, founder and CEO of security token platform Securitize, recently told Cryptonews.com that the digital securities industry is already ahead of the rest crypto industry in terms of KYC (know your customer) processes, so the impact of the travel rule should be minimal.

","According to Kaspersky's Cryptocurrency Report 2019, 19% of surveyed people (in 22 developed economies) have bought at least one kind of cryptoc urrency or another, and while this is an encouraging percentage for such an immature sector, it's clear that crypto still has a long way to go if it wants to become ubiquitous.","However, help is at hand, for 2020 looks set to bring a range of developments that will help drive further adoption of cryptocurrencies as well as blockchain-based platforms and services. From decentralized finance to central bank digital currencies and even economic recessions, these will combine to make crypto seem more attractive to organizations and individuals alike.First things first: just how accurate were Crypotnews.com's predictions regarding adoption trends in 2019? Well, this varies from sector to sector.One prediction was that banks and financial institutions would become increasingly interested in blockchain-based solutions, particularly for cross-border payments. This was borne out by the adoption or trialling of blockchain-based cross-border payments systems by, among others, HSBC, Wells Fargo, Standard Chartered, Mastercard, 60 banks in Latin America, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, the Bank of Thailand, the National Bank of Cambodia, and by Deutsche Bank and other banks joining JPMorgan's Interbank Information Network.Another prediction was that security tokens would rise in prominence. This has been proven true to some extent, insofar as there have been more security token offerings (STOs) in 2019 than there were in 2018, with the total for the first half of the year (55) outnumbering the total for all of its predecessor (35).Lastly, one other big prediction was that many of the big initial coin offerings (ICOs) of 2018 (and 2017) would actually begin launching their products in 2019, something which would usher in greater adoption. Once again, this has only been partly true: the mainnets of Filecoin and Hdac (two of the five biggest ICOs of 2017) are still waiting to be launched next year, while Sirin Labs (another of the 2017 big five) ended up axing 25% of its staff after disappointing sales of its Finney smartphone.So what is likely to be big, or at least get bigger, in 2020? Well, perhaps the biggest milestone on the horizon is the Bitcoin mining reward halving due to take place in May, something which experts believe will increase demand for the cryptocurrency.Bitcoin analyst Simon Dingle tells Cryptonews.com, ""This will further restrict supply, and I expect demand for Bitcoin to continue increasing throughout the year.""One other potential winner is decentralized finance (DeFi). This sub-sector has already witnessed some gains in 2019, but crypto analyst Lou Kerner thinks one particular event taking place towards the end of November will set it up for a very good 2020.""I think Multi-Collateral Dai, coming out November 18th, will be a major milestone in DeFi,"" he tells Cryptonews.com. ""New features include the Dai Savings Rate (DSR), which establishes an entirely new dimension for innovative Maker protocol integrations on the backend of DeFi dapps (decentralized apps).""Blockchain-based payment networks and platforms are also likely to see more use, with other companies likely to follow Facebook's lead in announcing their own versions of Libra, which itself is scheduled to be launched next year (conditions permitting).""We believe that there will be substantial growth in payment related blockchain projects and payment-oriented cryptocurrencies in 2020,"" says Filipe Castro, the CIO at crypto payments service Utrust. ""This expected growth is due to multiple factors including the expansion and diversification of stablecoin models, new private and government-led central bank digital currency initiatives (Libra, e-Yuan) and sheer market size.""(Learn more: Payments is the Main Battleground for Banks Amid Bitcoin Rise)Charles Phan of crypto exchange Interdax believes that two slightly less hyped up areas will grow in 2020. 
""Gaming is another area of crypto that is gaining traction,"" he tells Cryptonews.com. ""Gaming is another area of crypto that is gaining traction,"" he tells Cryptonews.com. ""With the roll-out of the Lightning Network we have seen Lightnite, a Fortnite-inspired game where players can earn a small amount of bitcoins. Recently, the venture arm of Blockchain (one of the biggest cryptocurrency companies in the world) invested in the blockchain game technology firm Enjin which shows that they think the crypto-gaming play is likely to be profitable.""Phan also thinks that cryptocurrencies belonging to exchanges, such as Binance Coin and Huobi Token, will grow. ""Exchange tokens are likely to continue to display strength in 2020 as more traders enter the crypto ecosystem and exchanges continue to innovate,"" he adds. ""These tokens incentivise traders to provide liquidity to the platform and reward them with lower trading fees.""Looking further into the future, one more element of the crypto ecosystem is likely to enjoy wider adoption over the next decade.""Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) will gain traction as an idea and we may even see one launch, with China and Switzerland the most likely to take the lead in this regard,"" predicts Vaibhav Kadikar, the founder and CEO of decentralized prediction market platform CloseCross.But as Charles Phan explains, this will take more than one year, due to the cumbersome and cautious nature of central banks and governments.""We are looking at a timescale of five years according to IBM and the Official Monetary Institutions Forum, while ING’s chief economist predicted that we’ll see a CBDC from a G20 country in the next 2-3 years,"" he says.And more generally, coming years could speed up cryptocurrency ownership, particularly if regional and/or global recessions occur.""I don't know when, but eventually we will have to pay the price for central banks printing money on overdrive, while debt has escalated to unimaginable levels,"" says Simon Dingle. ""A massive global recession is on the cards, and when it arrives we should see a whole new appreciation for deflationary and decentralized cryptocurrency.""__Learn more:

November 15, 2019
","Dan Conway, an author and a self-described “expert on crypto culture, decentralization and corporate America,” shared with the world how he bet his life savings on crypto and earned millions.  ","Conway says he was an executive in a vast corporation, struggling with depression and an addiction he thought defeated. Then “Dan stumbles upon cryptocurrency, tumbling down the rabbit hole to discover a strange, anarchic, but captivating world. He decides to wager everything—his savings, his marriage, his family, his future—on the fledgling crypto, Ether (ETH),” says the synopsis of Conway’s book, ‘Confessions of a Crypto Millionaire: My Unlikely Escape from Corporate America’ published in September. One of the three Forbs’ business books “you can’t afford to ignore” tells how, in May 2016, Conway went from his office to Wells Fargo to send USD 100,000 to New York-based cryptocurrency exchange Gemini. The writer says in the condensed version of the book published in the Hustle:This represented my family’s entire life savings. It was money my wife and I planned to use to pay for our 3 kids’ college tuition, our eventual retirement, and emergency expenses. I was a middle-aged guy with a family who had never been on the cutting edge of anything. But I was about to bet everything I had on an unproven virtual currency called Ethereum. This could only end two ways: I’d lose everything I owned, or make a fortune.Conway had a PR firm, Zealot Communications, focused on crypto projects, and he’s also the founder of one of the first Ethereum meetups in the San Francisco Bay Area, his website says. But before that, as he writes for the article, he was a 45-year-old middle manager at a major San Francisco multi-media company, leading a life many do – that of dissatisfaction and search for a way to escape. Though earning USD 150,000 a year, he disliked the corporate culture and its hierarchy, he says.He wanted to tell the story of his journey as he found it interesting, not to present himself as a master of the universe who figured it all out, unlike other timid people, he said in an interview. At the time when he and his wife were raising three kids and had a mortgage on their home, and he struggled with addiction to alcohol and drugs, Conway was sitting in his office before work, reading about the volatility of Bitcoin (BTC). It was mid-2015, and BTC fell from USD 1,200 to USD 300. And though he previously thought of putting ‘real’ money into a digital token as “bullshit,” now he suddenly wondered: “What if it goes up again? What if I put everything I had into this? I could get rich and never work another day in corporate America,” the author describes his thoughts. As is so often the case, the more he learned about crypto, the more interested in it he became.Just around the time of Conway’s growing crypto interest, Ethereum launched in July 2015. He was excited about blockchain’s promise of a decentralized future without hierarchy, he says. “In short order, I developed an Ethereum obsession.” He consumed anything on Ethereum he could get his hands on, spending hours daily listening and reading about it. And while his tech friends were dismissive of blockchain, his “biggest source of conviction” were Ethereum’s developers, Conway says, adding that the smartest developers were going to Ethereum. Another thing, as he said in an interview with Morgan Creek Digital co-founder Anthony Pompliano, is that he knew that ETH hadn’t popped yet, since it was “a new, emerging coin.”Occasionally, my Ethereum fever broke and I wondered if I’d gone off the deep end. Was my growing desire to invest in Ethereum a desperate attempt by a desperate man to find some kind of midlife salvation? Was this whole thing some kind of elaborate ruse to scam people like me out of their nest eggs?Less than a year later, the Wells Fargo scene happened, and Conway owned his first 6,993 ETH, at an average price of USD 14 (it trades at c. USD 182 today).Yes. Crypto is volatile. And here’s a timeline of how Conway experienced it on his own skin:“In a span of 4 months, my USD 300k investment ballooned to USD 6 million.” Worried about the constant rallies and drops, about the money he could lose, and about the safety of his coins, he became anxious, prone to mood swings, and even had panic attacks. “The coins consumed me and changed my entire persona.”ETH saw even a price of USD 400 that year, and 2,000% growth since the beginning of the year till October. When many HODLers started selling, Conway decided to keep on hodling. In December 2017, ETH shot up from USD 430 to USD 830, then it surpassed USD 1,000 in January.If I didn’t sell and ETH tanked, I’d lose it all. I’d have to tell Eileen and the kids that dad had dropped the golden goose egg, that I’d squandered my lottery ticket.As the price reached USD 915, over the course of two hours, Conway sold the majority of the coins he owned, 11,000 ETH, for USD 10 million.“Nearly 2 years later, it’s still surreal looking at our bank account and seeing high 7-figures, post-tax,” he says, adding that he still believes “crypto will open up new possibilities for organizing the world in the decades ahead, and I’m confident it will pop again as a result,” but that he doesn’t recommend that anyone try to replicate what he did, as many more fail than succeed. “I’ve since turned my efforts toward making the concept of crypto-based decentralization more accessible to the general public. My recent book, which chronicles my wild journey, encourages people to think about their own risk parameters,” Conway concludes. “Crypto no longer consumes me.”"

","SatoshiLabs, the manufacturer of the Trezor hardware wallet, has moved to distance itself from a somewhat unexpected endorsement from Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro.","Around 18 minutes into an hour-long state TV segment on cryptocurrencies that was also shared on the president's Facebook page, Maduro met representatives of a company named Trezorvenezuela, who gifted the president with a Trezor hardware wallet. Maduro responded by holding the device up to the camera and expressing his approval.But Satoshilabs has responded by issuing a statement claiming they have no official representatives in Venezuela. Trezor distanced itself from Trezorvenezuela – claiming the latter could even be guilty of copyright violations.Trezor wrote,""We’re in no way associated with those people claiming to be official representatives of Trezor, and do not endorse or permit their use of our brand. We are carefully investigating this copyright infringement. These individuals were authorized resellers of Trezor based on a mutual agreement made in Q3 2018.

","The BRICS Business Council has discussed the possibility of creating a single 'cryptocurrency' to facilitate settlements between member countries, after Russia’s sovereign wealth fund put forward a proposal.","The BRICS nations – Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa – met in Brazilia this week. The Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) says it tabled the motion at the summit. Its Director-General and BRICS Business Council member, Kirill Dmitriev, told reporters that the move was part of the BRICS members’ ongoing goal of reducing their dependence on United States dollars in foreign trade deals.Per RBC, Nikita Kulikov, PravoRobotov founder and the head of the parliamentary advisory committee on the digital economy, opined that the proposed BRICS cryptocurrency would be quite unlike most digital tokens.He stated that although “creating a cryptocurrency is not difficult, as the technology is understandable enough,” the BRICS token would not be a “fully formed settlement instrument.” Instead, it would provide parties with the ability to transfer payment obligations and create legally binding payment agreements.Kulikov opined,“It will not be moneyper se. Instead, one could call it a paperless document flow system that facilitates transactions.”Readers may recall that Russia and other CIS nations have previously discussed the idea of launching a digital token or cryptocurrency to facilitate cross-border payments.However, Moscow seems to favor a system that would let it restrict access to the token. Kulikov has previously stated that the so-called crypto-ruble, should it ever emerge, may only be used at the inter-state or inter-bank level. Politicians have stressed that such a token would not be for public or individual use – and would likely only be used by official government channels or in international B2B trade deals.The crypto proposal is part of a wider BRICS discussion on creating a shared payment system. Dmitriev has indicated that board members are united in their support of such a system.BRICS nations are also keen to create a currency-agnostic mobile-based e-pay system for the general public in all five nations called BRICS Pay. The platform would make use of a mobile app linked to personal bank accounts that would let customers in any of the nations pay for purchases in any BRICS country-based store."

",Privacy focused cryptocurrency Grin (GRIN) plummeted in the last 24 hours after a report started making rounds online of an attack on the privacy protocol Mimblewimble.,"As a reminder, while Beam (BEAM) is the first implementation of Mimblewimble, it was followed by the long-expected, community funded privacy coin Grin, released at the beginning of the year. In the past 24 hours, Grin (ranked 127th by market capitalization) dropped 16.8%, though it appreciated 6.8% in the past week. It started dropping on November 18th, and at the moment of writing (UTC 9:15) it trades at USD 1.26. Beam (ranked 145th) too has fell 11.6% in 24 hours and 4.31% in a week, now trading at USD 0.61.Yesterday, Ivan Bogatyy, a venture capitalist at Dragonfly Capital, published a report titled “Breaking Mimblewimble’s Privacy Model,” making a key claim that: “Mimblewimble’s privacy is fundamentally flawed. Using only USD 60/week of AWS spend, I was able to uncover the exact addresses of senders and recipients for 96% Grin transactions in real time.” He added that this is a problem inherent to Mimblewimble, which is likely unfixable, and that it shouldn’t be considered “a viable alternative to Zcash (ZEC) or Monero (XMR) when it comes to privacy” any longer.My attack catches 96% transactions before they can be aggregated with others for anonymity. So in reality, there is no one in their anonymity set! pic.twitter.com/mkMhSxYh5BHowever, Monero has also issued a security warning:#Monero Security Warning:Meanwhile, the reactions to the Mimblewimble news were swift. Emin Gün Sirer, CEO of Ava Labs, which created the decentralized services platform Ava, called the report an “excellent attack on the MimbleWimble protocol.”With Ivan's discovery, Grin and Beam are no longer privacy coins. They also have other drawbacks (e g. need to be online to receive payments, high inflation) compared to nonprivacy coins like Bitcoin.Bitcoiner and developer Udi Wertheimer also commented on people’s defense of Mimblewimble according to which this is a known attack. “Sure. People who know mimblewimble intimately knew about it and mentioned it a lot,” he says. “But still, no one executed it to empirically show how effective it is, which means most people still didn’t know about it. […] The fact is that most people still thought it offers unique privacy properties.”If at all, there’s a lesson here to mimblewimble proponents. Why is it that this is a very well known flaw (and a very serious one too), and yet many people interested in MW don’t know about it at all?There’s an opportunity to improve there.What Wertheimer is talking about, for example, is a blog post published by Grin developer Daniel Lehnberg, according to which Bogatyy’s report is inaccurate. “The described “attack” on Mimblewimble/Grin is a misunderstanding of a known limitation,” and “the results presented do not actually constitute an attack, nor do they back up the sensationalized claims made,” Lehnberg writes. Instead, it’s “the well-documented and discussed transaction graph input-output-linkability problem,” familiar to the Grin team and anyone who has studied the Mimblewimble protocol, the developer claims.Another Grin developer, David Burkett, tweeted that it’s a “Really awesome write-up, but none of this is ""news."" I'm actually surprised only 96% was traceable. There are a number of ways to help break linkability in Grin, but none are implemented and released yet. As I always say, don't use Grin if you require privacy - it's not there yet.”Another person to have allegedly known about this is Litecoin (LTC)  creator Charlie Lee, who announced a collaboration with Mimblewimble back in February, as Litecoin has become privacy-focused, and who’s been defending their partner on Twitter. This limitation of MimbleWimble protocol is well known. MW is basically Confidential Transactions with scaling benefits and slight unlinkability. To get much better privacy, you can still use CoinJoin before broadcasting and CJ works really well with MW due to CT and aggregation. https://t.co/M5sx92nzlZ__Learn more:

","Japanese cryptocurrency enthusiasts are watching business developments with interest after Softbank, the financial group that owns over 48% of Yahoo Japan, admitted that it was in talks with the operator of the Line chat app over a potential merger.","Line has recently launched its Bitmax cryptocurrency exchange in Japan, and operates exchanges and blockchain business operations in a number of other Asian countries. The company claims it has 81 million monthly active users on its chat app, which features a Bitmax interface.Yahoo Japan, meanwhile, is one of the biggest backers of rival exchange TaoTao, which launched in May this year.Takumi Yuzawa, a Tokyo-based cryptocurrency investor and business owner, told Cryptonews.com, “Undoubtedly the merger is going to have a very big impact on the cryptocurrency scene here in Japan.”And Yuzawa remarked,“Let’s imagine that these companies end merging their cryptocurrency operations. In that case, we are either going to end up with one very big and powerful crypto player – or one of those companies might end up exiting the market, meaning we lose a player.”Neither company has yet spoken about possibly cryptocurrency plans after the merger. However, talks are almost certainly ongoing regarding crypto business plans, after Nikkei claimed the parties had “entered the final stages” of negotiations.Yahoo Japan is officially owned by Z Holdings, but Softbank holds a controlling stake in the company. The Yahoo Japan search engine and related apps have some 48 million monthly active users.Line, meanwhile, is the brainchild of South Korean internet giant Naver, the country’s equivalent to Google.Per Jiji, one merger option currently on the table is creating a 50-50 joint-owned company, which would result in the company operating two Financial Services Agency-licensed crypto exchanges.In a scathing critique, Bloomberg writer Tim Culpan opined that Line has been “marching toward irrelevance since its dual Tokyo and New York initial public offerings three years ago,” and said the company’s move into the world of cryptocurrency was a sign of “desperation.”Both companies have also developed extensive e-pay business operations, with Line’s Line Pay and Yahoo Japan’s PayPay already rolled out across the country. The latter has also been integrated with Ripple’s MoneyTap app, while Line Pay has been working with Visa on blockchain-powered cross-border payments and “alternative currency” transaction solutions."

However, altcoins followed it down, leaving the absolute majority of top 100 coins in red. Meanwhile, XTZ was the only coin in green among the top 30 earlier today. Though its price has shown large fluctuations, XTZ, ranked 16th by market capitalization, is maintaining the price above USD 1 and reached USD 1.28 earlier today, when it still was up in the past 24 hours. However, later it turned red and is now (13:04 UTC) trading at c.

A week later, Tezos price rallied, making XTZ the best performer in the top 100, which coincided with the news from two major cryptocurrency exchanges: 1) Coinbase has begun offering staking rewards to its Tezos customers in most American states; 2) OKEx announced the XTZ staking service and started XTZ spot trading. Besides that, the Tezos Foundation has been organizing Tezos meetups across the world this month, Tezos Ukraine launched last week, and Tezos Southeast Asia partnered with RF International Holdings in order to promote cooperation in exploring Tezos applications to encourage adoption, they said. Additionally, Swiss primary stock exchange SIX listed a crypto exchange-traded product (ETP) tied to XTZ, issued by fintech company Amun AG. Furthermore, a press release dated November 19 states that the French Armies and Gendarmerie’s Information & Public Relations Center (SIRPA) announced that the Gendarmerie’s cybercrime division (C3N) “has been validating judicial expenses incurred during investigations and recording them on the Tezos blockchain” since September. Also, in a recent interview, Bruno Le Maire, France’s Minister of the Economy and Finance, said that “the development of the blockchain ecosystem is a priority for the government,” while one of the startups that has caught his eyes is Tezos."

","America’s top tax authority, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), has somewhat provided clarification about its recent cryptocurrency tax guidelines. However, their final decision regarding taxing promotional airdrops is yet to be made.","Critics pointed out a range of potential problems with the latest guidelines, issued in October.Perhaps most glaring among these issues was a section about “airdrops” – which, in the world of cryptocurrencies, is usually used to refer to promotional giveaways or customer rewards.However, as previously reported, the IRS seems to have used this term to refer to hard forks – situations where a blockchain splits, sometimes meaning that token holders receive holdings in a new cryptocurrency.Per Bloomberg Tax, Christopher Wrobel, an attorney in the IRS Office of the Associate Chief Counsel (Income Tax and Accounting) confirmed that while hard fork-generated revenues are taxable under the latest rulings, the revenue ruling doesn’t apply to promotional airdrop giveaways. But Wrobel did state that the IRS “hasn’t yet decided” whether such promotional airdrops should be treated as taxable.And Suzanne Sinno, an attorney in the IRS Office of the Associate Chief Counsel (Income Tax and Accounting), told the same media outlet that like-kind exchange principles have never been applicable to cryptocurrency, in the IRS’ view.This dashes hopes expressed by a number of tax experts. Some had claimed that people making profits on token sales that they reinvested in other cryptocurrencies would be able to postpone paying taxes, as rules governing like-kind exchanges were not formulated in the United States until 2017.But the IRS’ latest statement would appear to mean that even pre-2018 crypto-to-crypto exchanges cannot be deferred."

","Two good news have reached the most popular smart contract platform and second biggest crypto network by market capitalization, Ethereum (ETH), in the past few days. "," The network has managed to remain unclogged despite the growing numbers of ERC-721 token transfers. In fact, the network has handled more than 3.7 million Ethereum ERC-721 transfers on November 17th alone, which is four times more than the previous all-time high, states cryptoasset analytics firm Coin Metrics.The company explained that the massive spike in ERC-721 transactions originates from an Ethereum-based digital collectibles game Gods Unchained. The transfers didn’t clog the Ethereum blockchain either, as its blocks haven’t surpassed 85% of their capacity since mid-October. The company also clarified that this is due to “batching hundreds of transfers in single transactions.” In contrast, another widely popular Ethereum-based game, CryptoKitties, has had only approximately 4.7 million transfers through its entire existence. The network congestion has been a major issue for Ethereum in the past, and one of the issues motivating the transition to the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm based Ethereum 2.0.Other Ethereum news comes from DappRadar, a dapp data aggregator and analysis company, which announced the implementation of the ERC-20 token tracking for all Ethereum dapps.  The new measure helped to discover more than USD 73 million of unaccounted 7-day (November 10-17) rolling average transaction volume. Previously, only the volume of ETH cryptocurrency was being tracked, and it resulted in approx. USD 27 million weekly transaction volume in the same period. Including the ERC-20 token transactions, the total 7-day volume has increased to just over USD 100 million worth of value exchanged weekly, or more than USD 5.6 billion annual transaction volume (in theory). Ethereum-based dapps make up over 60% of all dapps listed on DappRadar.""This will greatly increase the transparency of value creation on the Ethereum blockchain, especially for decentralized exchanges that support the trading of ETH-based tokens and the fast-growing DeFi (decentralized finance) category,"" said Skirmantas Januskas, CEO and Co-founder of DappRadar.  The company says that this feature is also live on EOS and that it plans to roll it out on all other protocols in the unspecified future."

",Binance has become another major crypto exchange that is investing in India despite the local government said it's considering a total cryptocurrency ban in the country. ,"After South Korea’s major crypto exchange Bithumb said in October that is hoping to launch an exchange in India, Binance moved faster and for undisclosed sum acquired a local exchange, WazirX, ranked 159th by trading volume (USD 344,564 in the past 24 hours, according to Coinpaprika).  According to Binance, the acquisition will allow to launch ""multiple fiat-to-crypto gateways"" and their users will be able to use Indian rupee (INR) to buy/sell crypto starting November 25th. The company plans that the first quarter of 2020 will see WazirX’s auto-matching engine integrated into the Binance Fiat Gateway platform. This will enable Binance.com users to directly place orders on that exchange, as well as the Binance iOS or Android app, in order to purchase tether (USDT) against INR. With the purchase of USDT from the WazirX digital asset marketplace, users will be able to trade any digital asset available on Binance.com.According to Nischal Shetty, WazirX CEO, “fiat on-ramps play a critical role in deciding the size and adoption of cryptomarket.” With more than a billion people, India “is primed for massive crypto adoption and this acquisition by Binance gives us the opportunity to not only cater to India but every developing nation where fiat on-ramps have to be built.”On the other hand, the community can get the native WazirX token (WRX) – currently held by some 64,000 users – through trade mining and signups, but the exchange also announced that a token sale is “under consideration.” As India is home to over a billion people, and it’s expected to have 34.33% share of youth in total population by 2020, according to a government report, with more than 141 million of 18-to-23-year-olds in 2016 according to Statista, blockchain and crypto industry might see a lot of new users in this country. However, as reported, the Indian government has considered stern measures as part of any potential crackdown, with ministers even considering a proposal to punish cryptocurrency holders with jail sentences of up to 10 years. There are no official statements that would indicate any changes in this policy since the news was confirmed in July 2019. In either case, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao says that ""the young demographic in India give an edge to adopt and build on new financial technologies"": ""I believe this will play a vital role in making India a global blockchain innovation center to also spur cryptocurrency adoption throughout the larger public in the country.” Meanwhile, another local player, Kunal Barchha, the CEO of India-based crypto-exchange CoinRecoil, recently told Cryptonews.com that he expects ""an overall positive wave in terms of regulations all around the globe,"" despite he previously estimated that the Indian government will ban cryptocurrencies. “The first phase was of rejection, second was of criticism, and finally, governments all around the world have understood that they will lose a lot more if they keep the same attitude,” Barchha said.Binance also said they’re supporting the development of blockchain in India in general, with, for example, inviting Indian blockchain community to apply for Binance X fellowship.At the moment of writing (10:21 UTC), Binance coin (BNB), the native token of Binance, trades at c. USD 17.50. It dropped 7% in 24 hours and 17% in a week. And while many have congratulated both exchanges on this move, some thought that WazirX and Indian exchanges in general could do better.Congratulations @NischalShetty Its superb news in this morningI strongly believe @WazirXIndia could have become world no.1 exchange by own brand but you rather chose the other path of getting acquired and exit strategy.Learn more: What Effect Could an Indian Ban Have on the Global Crypto Industry?"

Kuroda said that global stablecoins could have a significant impact on monetary policy and the stability of the financial system.But elsewhere in Asia, Japanese media outlets are also reporting that the National Bank of Cambodia (NBC) believes it will be ready to launch a digital currency and blockchain-powered payments system in 2020 – with the aid of a Japanese technology provider.The NBC has been working with Japanese blockchain firm Soramitsu since 2017 on a wide range of blockchain projects, and the two parties could be ready to release the Bakong token at some point next year.Earlier this month, the NBC’s director-general Serey Chea told Asahi Shimbum that although only some 20%-30% of Cambodians have bank accounts, the vast majority have smartphones and other mobile devices – a fact that the NBC simply must do something about.Chea said,“Cambodia is a latecomer [when it comes to technology], but that is why it is possible for this country to adopt a platform that uses the latest technology. Using blockchain technology, with NBC as the main administrator, it will be possible to connect the whole country with a nationwide electronic payment system. When citizens create a bank-issued e-wallet using the platform, they will also automatically be issued with a bank account.”Chea stated that “most Cambodian banks” have agreed to collaborate on the Bakong project. However, she also urged caution, dismissing reports that circulated several months ago about a government-issued cryptocurrency named Enterpay."

","NEO blockchain, regularly titled as “Chinese Ethereum,” appears to be underperforming in the realm of dapps (decentralized apps) - even smaller networks have more dapps and their users. However, it seems that NEO is currently not focusing on dapps.","After pumping along with other “Chinese” coins recently, NEO got back into the top 20 coins by market capitalization list and currently trades at c. USD 10.7 and is up by 42% in a month (13:35 UTC). Nevertheless, the smart economy blockchain is seemingly losing the dapp race to other platforms.Ethereum remains the leading dapp platform by the number of applications, followed by EOS and Tron. Less popular options remain Ontology, IOST, VeChain, and Loom Network. The list below also excludes other popular dapp platforms such as STEEM, which, according to Dapp.com and StateOfTheDapps.com indexes, has over 90 dapps, as well as less popular Klaytn, TomoChain, POA, and other platforms.(DappRadar claims it filters out bot activity and identifies actual numbers of dapp users.)NEO did not respond to our requests for comment, but their recent interviews show that dapps aren’t the main focus of the platform right now. For instance, in a recent interview with u.Today, NEO’s Head of Development, John deVadoss said NEO's vision is to develop a comprehensive full-stack for developers first, and that what’s the upcoming NEO 3.0 is all about. “What I see is they’re looking for this ideal dapp, the sort of mythical, elusive, “unicorn” dapp. They say: “Oh yeah, once we get the dapp we will get adoption.” But that’s not how it works. There’s no mythical dapp. They are completely wrong. The way adoption works is you enable millions of developers, and when you do so, a thousand flowers will bloom, and among those flowers, there will be many dapps that will drive adoption and more importantly usage.”Meanwhile, during the recent Reddit AMA (Ask Me Anything) session, NEO co-founders Da Hongfei and Erik Zhang stated that there are dozen of games and DeFi (decentralized finance) applications in the pipeline, adding that their first priority is stablecoin and non-custodial exchange. Answering a question about attracting more attention with more developers and useful dapps, Da Hongfei stated that the ""number of active dapps does matter,"" but its more important what are they and how are they being used: ""NEO doesn't encourage gambling applications which counts the majority of the numbers on other blockchains. As the digital asset protocol, NEO has a high priority on enabling applications such as collateral-based stablecoin and non-custodial exchange. There are two working non-custodial exchange now but we lack of a well-received stablecoin comparable to DAI on Ethereum.""According to an analysis by Electric Capital, NEO had less than 100 developers in June 2019. Whereas, Ethereum reportedly had more than 1,200 active developers. A recent press release by The State Of Dapps claims that NEO now has more than 2 million wallet addresses, over half a million community members and more than 300 contributors worldwide.On a related note, last week NEO has announced a “Scaling and Interoperability” partnership with nahmii, the layer-2 blockchain scaling solution developed by hubii. The layer will act as a bridge between NEO and Ethereum.""Developers across multiple platforms, NEO, Ethereum, and Bitcoin, will soon be able to use a single interface to build products on many blockchains,"" said Jacobo Toll-Messia, CEO of hubii.Earlier this year, NEO opened a development hub in Seattle, U.S., and onboarded several Microsoft veterans to its team, including John deVadoss, who worked at Microsoft for more than 16 years. In May 2019, it also announced EcoBoost, a USD 100 million fund for projects that are building on NEO. Initially launched in 2015 as ""Antshares"" and rebranded to NEO in 2017, the project’s primary focus is digitized assets and building the ""next-generation internet."""

","Basic Attention Token (BAT), ranked 29th by market capitalization, is green throughout following the news of Brave launching version 1.0 of its privacy-focused browser. ","BAT, the native token of Brave, the first decentralized browser based on blockchain technology that lets users earn tokens as they browse, is seeing a lot of green today. At the time of writing (11:33 UTC), the price is up 7% in the past 24 hours, and 3.6% in the past week. It’s also green in the past-month and past-year time frames, going up 17% and 10% respectively. BAT price chart:This comes a day after Brave announced the official launch of Brave 1.0 for Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS in 52 languages. A difference from the previous version is that “the Brave browser was previously in beta release,” the announcement states, adding that it “already has 8.7 million monthly active users across the globe.” The version 1.0 of the open source creation of Brendan Eich, who is co-founder and CEO of Brave Software, Javascript creator and Mozilla project co-founder, includes:BAT has a history of reacting positively to good news. In July, it went up 5% after Brave introduced a button for Reddit users to tip each other. Also, it jumped 10% in October after Brave surpassed 8 million monthly active users. In April, the browser celebrated a number of successes, and in May it started testing a new feature for tipping tweets."

","A multi-collateral stablecoin Dai is officially live and is assigned the name Dai. The single-collateral stablecoin Dai (DAI), now has been renamed to Sai.","Following Friday’s executive vote by Maker (MKR) stakeholders, the MakerDAO system has seen the activation of Multi-Collateral Dai (MCD), and “beginning immediately, anyone, anywhere can upgrade” the old to new Dai through MakerDAO’s Migration Portal, the announcement says. MCD will allow users to create Dai stablecoins backed by multiple collateral types. While collateral for loans could previously only have been committed in Ethereum (ETH), now Brave’s Basic Attention Token (BAT) can be used as a collateral as well. MakerDAO also offers a DAI savings option meant for rewarding Dai holders with a variable interest rate paid out in Dai.Furthermore, the Maker community is also evaluating Augur (REP), meaning that “with MKR voter approval, almost any tokenized asset that has appropriate risk parameters could be made available as collateral in the future.”According to an earlier announcement, the Maker Protocol is upgraded to a new version, MCD, on Monday but the old version is still alive and will be kept that way “for some indeterminate amount of time.” This old version, renamed to Single-Collateral Dai (SCD), will be running in parallel to MCD during that time, meaning that the MKR community will be managing two Dai currencies, two stability fees, and two ecosystems, as the post says. “Please note,” MakerDAO writes, “the current SCD version of Dai will be called ‘Sai,’ and the new MCD version will be referred to as ‘Dai’,” MakerDAO writes, “and remember that the opportunity to migrate is not open-ended. The Maker community may, at some point, determine that it is no longer possible or desirable to effectively manage the Sai ecosystem, and could trigger an Emergency Shutdown of SCD.” This also brings into question the ‘decentralized’ part in ‘decentralized finance,’ as Dai is not entirely decentralized at the moment.People online have been calling MCD a milestone in DeFi (decentralized finance) history and are already wondering what’s next to come, with a number of options/wishes placed on the table, such as: Bitcoin (BTC) being accepted as a collateral for borrowing Dai, Dai becoming number two stablecoin, bringing decentralized cross-chain interoperability to DeFi, etc.Other people, however, believe that Dai (as well as the new-old Sai) needs to be explained better and brought to more people. Developer Udi Wertheimer commented that “MakerDAO is launching its reeducation plan: exchanges who previously listed the “decentralized” DAI token are expected to delist it or give it another name.” He further added that people “not going through life constantly reading crypto twitter and smart contracts” believe “DAI is a stablecoin backed by ETH (fairly liquid and a bit less volatile than other shitcoins),” but when they go to an exchange to buy some – “Oops! Here’s a Brave-backed shitcoin instead,” says the developer. They did create a different one, but switched the names. Why? To leverage the DAI brand name, a name they controlFrom the regulation side of the equation, it’s still quite unclear as to what regulators’ response to Dai is exactly. “How regulators treat Dai could help shape how, and if, cryptocurrencies can evolve from speculative use to a de facto money of the internet,” writes Reuters. The U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority said that each coin needs to be analyzed individually, and that it did not use the term ‘stablecoin’ given that “stability was purely an aspiration.” On the other hand, Phil Angeloff, a lawyer at Clifford Chance in Washington who has worked on stablecoins, is quoted as saying that “the regulators are trying to fit the existing framework onto these new technologies.” However, CEO at Stealthy new venture and Founding Board Member of Israeli Blockchain Industry Forum, Maya Zehavi, put the legal liability of using DAI for derivatives into question. Furthermore, commenting MakerDao’s termination and suspension policy, she says that it “seems that as part of the TOS MKR can change or terminate any of the DAI at anytime with no prior notice,” asking: “so own your own coins is a marketing mirage?”DeFi is not for financing the unbanked if the base asset issuer of the most popular stablecoin reverts back to the same old OFAC sanction list. That marketing slogan for DeFi is as fake news as Trumps next tweet. What's unlcear is the legal liability of using DAI for derviatives https://t.co/DnATGANeuyAt pixel time (12:02 PM UTC), DAI is ranked 56th by market capitalization (USD 100 million). "

","The Cryptoverse, including CEOs of Binance and Tron, is advising PornHub, a major porn website, and their performers on how to deal with their payment conundrum after PayPal stopped model payouts: use more crypto. (Updated on November 15, 09:44 UTC: updates in bold).","“We are all devastated by PayPal's decision to stop payouts to over a hundred thousand performers who rely on them for their livelihoods,” the adult website stated in their urgent announcement.A PayPal spokesperson told Cryptpnews.com, that ""following a review, we have discovered that PornHub has made certain business payments through PayPal without seeking our permission. We have taken action to stop these transactions from occurring.""""Decisions like that of PayPal and other major companies do nothing but harm efforts to end discrimination and stigma towards sex workers. While we still have several payment methods for our models available, we will continue to add more sex worker friendly ones. We currently pay out in Verge and are evaluating adding other cryptocurrency payout options,"" PornHub said in an emailed statement to Cryptonews.com.In either case, the Cryptoverse has been lending a hand, suggesting to the performers to abandon the “puritanical” payment processors, as one Twitter user described them, and to try crypto. SetProtocol product marketing manager Anthony Sassano commented that “stablecoins are a much better choice than Bitcoin (BTC)” if one want to hold those coins for even the smallest amount of time. Some commentators agree that the most liquid crypto is the best choice if a person wants to receive crypto, covert it to fiat and send it to their bank account right away. On the other hand, Jeff Garzik, the CEO of blockchain startup Bloq, asked: “What cryptocurrency technology is realistically up to the challenge of handling all of the payment flows from BigSite to Paypal right now, today?”BTC? Small payments discouragedBCH? Pro-payment + b/w constrained vs Pornhub traffic.Lightning? Not ready + b/w constrainedEOS/3rd gen fast-tx chain? Maybe. Still a ton of on-chain traffic.Tax events, if not a stablecoin.So, then: A stablecoin + helper network. Candidates?Even CEO of major cryptocurrency exchange Binance, Changpeng Zhao, joined the conversation:Sounds like an opportunity for #crypto? https://t.co/vHG8XrtHU5Another CEO, this time Justin Sun of Tron (TRX), said that PornHub accepts TRX payment. “We need to add USDT-TRC20 supports too,” he tweeted. Many other provided their opinions too:Crypto, personal portal... LOL. I don’t understand what that even is. I’m cool with just direct deposit into my bank account.when you get paid with $ you have to go through a centralized third party (paypal, etc.) and can be ""blacklisted"" but when you get paid through crypto it is just peer to peer so you get paid directly from the customer.you can then exchange the crypto for $ which is quite easy!Under their current method of payments, the site lists Paxum wallet, check, direct deposit and Verge (XVG) cryptocurrency that needs to be accompanied with a Verge wallet for the recipient to accept a payment. “We’ll use the Verge > USD conversion rate from 12:00PM EST on the 6th of each month,” the site explains. PornHub claims it averages over 100 billion video views a year, with 20 million registered users, as well as over 100 million daily and over 36 billion yearly visits. It started accepting Verge in April 2018 in order to follow community's privacy and payment preferences. And though XVG dropped at the time of the announcement of the partnership with PornHub, it’s now seeing a rise.At the moment of writing (9:14 UTC), the price of XVG is USD 0.0038. It appreciated 2.91% in the last 24 hours, though it saw a drop of 4.64% in a week.Meanwhile, as Beijing found it more difficult to spread the anti-Hong Kong-protests narrative after thousands of such accounts have been removed from major sites YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, it turned to PornHub as a new platform for propaganda videos, writes Quartz. The article mentions three separate accounts with eighteen videos in total at the time."
