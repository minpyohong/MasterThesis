But the price also retraced towards the golden ratio (0.618-0.65 Fibonacci level) of the whole upwards push from $7,300 to $10,500. This means that bulls must now step in to reverse the downward trend seen so far this month.BTC USD weekly chart. Source: TradingViewThis current market cycle is still showing many similarities with the previous one, i.e. a breakout from the bear market, causing the price to move from $3,100 to $13,900.¬†This parabolic move has led to a range-bound period and accumulation at higher levels suggesting that a breakout before the next halving is possible.¬†During the last few months, the same movements occurred as the $7,300 level was marked with similar bullish divergences. This also marked the ?úlow range??of the range-bound period, marked green in the chart.But does this mean further bullishness is warranted? No, because in the short-term, the price is retracing.

Additionally, previous support levels are now becoming resistance.For example, $9,050 was broken as support, which caused the price to drop to the next support level at $8,700. This leads to a retest of the previous support at $9,050, only to confirm that it flipped to become resistance.In downtrends, this is a continuous movement and, unfortunately for the bulls, this is still occurring on the smaller timeframes.BTC USD bullish scenario. Source: TradingViewTherefore, bulls must break out of this downtrend, preferably with a double bottom confirmation or bullish divergences. After that, a breakout above $8,700 is needed in order to flip that resistance level into new support.The yellow zone is crucial here and needs to hold (as this is also the golden ratio), followed by a clearcut break of the $8,800 area, preferably with high volume.BTC USD bearish scenario. Source: TradingViewNevertheless, as short-term momentum is still favoring bears, a continuation of the downtrend is more likely to occur. In this regard, a few scenarios are possible for a bearish outlook, which both lead to the same lower level.In the first scenario, the price is unable to break out of this short downtrend and falls below the yellow zone and golden ratio. A potential bounce upwards could then provide a short opportunity. However, testing the green area around $7,400 is most likely to occur in such a move.BTC USD second bearish scenario. Source: TradingViewThe second scenario has the same conclusion as the first one, but a different approach. Here, the price is able to break out of the downtrend but lacks volume and is not able to go beyond $8,700. Such a fakeout often leads to a sharp dump during which bounces will also provide some good opportunities for shorting.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

Bounces from this trendline have been strong and previous analysis and the VPVR suggests the $8,300 to $7,800 range as a possible support area where buyers are expected to show interest.Taking a macro view of Bitcoin?ôs price action on the daily timeframe (chart above), further downside moves in the falling wedge could see the price drop to the support levels (pink bars) at $8,591 and $8,305.

After all, Bitcoin (BTC) price was $9,300 last week, which is $200 higher than it is now. So let?ôs take a look at some of the factors causing, and fuelling these swings.Daily crypto market performance. Source: Coin360.comBitcoin price (BTC) took a dive from $9,265 and closed at $8,804.88 on Friday, November 8th, in what is becoming quite the predictable event, the CME Gap.Last week many traders were screaming for $8,885 to be filled, and even though this is becoming quite a regular thing, world-renowned Bitcoin hater, Peter Schiff took to Twitter to call for a dump in Bitcoin price. Schiff tweeted,¬†?úIt looks like the #Bitcoin pump is finally over. Get ready for the dump!?ùOf course, one only has to look at the engagement Mr. Schiff receives on his anti-Bitcoin crusade to see that he gets 14 times more interaction on his crypto tweets than he does on his dreary tweets about gold.Outside of Schiff?ôs ever dreary tweets, the situation seems to be improving for Bitcoin. The CME gap has been filled so what can traders expect from Bitcoin over the coming week?¬†BTC USD daily chart. Source: TradingViewThe Bollinger Bands indicator on Bitcoin?ôs daily chart shows that the price has been hovering around the moving average (MA) which is now near $8,900 since the CME gap was filled.When the price is set so close to the middle of the indicator traders could be fooled into thinking the odds of falling to the support at $7,800 are equal to the odds of the price rising to the resistance of $10,130. Fortunately for the bulls, there are quite a few factors that suggest the price is more likely to rise over the next week rather than fall.The first thing to consider is that the CME gap is something of an anomaly unique to the Bitcoin price action. As such, the Bitcoin price usually recovers almost immediately after it?ôs filled. So why hasn?ôt it bounced back after shedding $500 off the Bitcoin price nearly 3 days on?Bitcoin Historical Price Data. Source: CoinMarketCapThis question can be answered quite easily as one only needs to look at the trading volume of Bitcoin on weekends compared to weekdays to see that the volume is much thinner on Saturdays and Sundays compared to the working week.As such, it would be entirely plausible to consider that as the markets open across the world on Monday, trading volume for Bitcoin will increase, and this would be a key factor in driving the price. But forecasting volume alone, cannot guarantee an increase in price, so to find more reason for this, one must also take a look at a couple of proven indicators to better gauge the next move.¬†Bitcoin Weekly Trading Volume. Source: Bitcoinity.orgBTC USD weekly MACD. Source: TradingViewOut of all the technical indicators available, the Moving Average Divergence Convergence (MACD) is the one to watch on the weekly timeframe. The price dump on Nov. 8 caused the oscillator to alter its trajectory ever so slightly, however, thanks to Sunday?ôs price rally, it seems increasingly probable that a bull cross could occur in the next 2 to 3 weeks if not sooner.When the MACD crosses bullish on this time frame, Bitcoin never fails to impress, as such this is a huge buying signal to traders. As mentioned earlier, it?ôs still not quite there yet, however it is on another popular crypto asset.ETH USD weekly MACD. Source: TradingViewLast week?ôs analysis covered a similar scenario for Litecoin (LTC) and since then the altcoin increased by 13%, rallying from $57.64 to $64.27 within just 4 days. Right now, Ether (ETH) is looking almost identical from a technical perspective, with the only difference being the fact that the digital asset could catalyze a number of altcoins to rally due to their pairings across many exchanges.Therefore, it?ôs safe to ask, Is this the start of the next altcoin season? Let?ôs take a look at where Ether price could goETH USD weekly. Source: TradingViewIf Ether were to rally, this would be a welcome pump. Assuming that Ether tallied the same percentage of gains that Litecoin experienced last week, the price would sit $5 above the moving average on the Bollinger Bands indicator.¬†This could set Ethereum up for a run-up to around $285 which wouldn?ôt just bring the Ethereum market capitalization up by 30%, it would also potentially have a huge knock-on effect with ETH-paired altcoins which could trigger a retail FOMO phenomena similar to the one seen in 2017.Bitcoin needs to fend off a few areas of support. Should the current support of $8,900 fail to hold, it opens up a new level around $7,800 that needs to be defended. One would hope that the days of seeing the Bitcoin price at this level are over for 2019, however, it was only a few weeks ago that the majority of Bitcoin bears on Twitter were calling for $6,000 Bitcoin this year. Should $7,800 fail to hold, this could then become a reality.As the weekly candle closes, it is likely to send a strong buy signal to traders. Bitcoin has to first break $9,900 before investors and traders alike can expect a 5 digit Bitcoin. Should Bitcoin price exceed expectations and march past $10,000 to find support above $10,130, then the digital asset will be set for a bullish MACD cross in the immediate future. This could be the push Bitcoin requires to achieve a new all-time high.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the @officiallykeith and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

to open a long position at $6,900. 14285 Total views. 127 Total ...",23-Nov-19,"This has been a mixed week, with some small gains and losses on Bitcoin (BTC) longs and small earnings on alt trades which I will discuss in the coming weeks. I would like to take this opportunity to explain a few things about my trading style and approach in general, as it can be confusing for many.","First, I do not short Bitcoin. This is not because I have no desire to look for short positions, but because I am American and cannot legally trade on leverage exchanges that offer Bitcoin shorts. The only exchange where I can legally short is Kraken, which is notorious for huge wicks on candles that don?ôt exist on other exchanges. I will not trade anywhere that my risk management strategy cannot be properly executed - so long wicks that stop out traders who would otherwise be fine elsewhere are not acceptable for me.That said, I only look for long entries, which is not an ideal situation, as it forces me to trade against the trend when I want to enter a position. I am comfortable with this because I have a proven and well-defined trading system. It allows me to take many small losses, compensated for by a couple of large gains a year.This works for me but is unlikely to work for another trader who does not fully understand my situation and system. To that end, nobody should copy my trades, or anyone else?ôs. The responsibility to develop and enact a system is yours, and your system will be a result of your own financial situation, timeline, and expectations.It is also important to note that I only trade with a small percentage of my overall portfolio. I only trade 15% of the funds allocated to my crypto portfolio and my total crypto allocation represents only 10% of my entire investment portfolio. As I often say, I plan my losses, expecting some of the trades I make to go against me. As such, I am comfortable losing my entire trading portfolio, and it would not have any effect on my life. That is my system.I would also like to drop a quick note about longing and shorting cryptocurrencies. In my opinion, longing is potentially far more profitable and less risky than going short on Bitcoin, or any other asset. I recently tweeted about this and was a bit shocked at the lack of understanding of this concept amongst traders that are actively shorting with leverage.At the core, a zero leverage short?ôs maximum earning potential is 100% if the asset goes to 0. You cannot do better than doubling your money. The theoretical upside of a long position is infinite. That is why a short from the Bitcoin top at $20,000 all of the way to the low of $3,200 was less profitable than a simple long from $3,200 back to $6,400. Beginners should not short, they should buy dips in an upward trending market.As discussed in the last journal entry, I opened a Bitcoin position at $8,375. The price rose immediately, so as I usually do, I moved my stop loss up. I ended up stopping out at my entry price and broke even.I also took another position as price continued down, at $8,010. Price retraced to the 78.6% Fibonacci level, a very deep retracement relative to previous corrections. This seemed like a reasonable place for a bounce. There were also clear bullish divergences on all time frames from 6 hours down, which ultimately failed.BTC USD 4 hour chart. Source: TradingViewThe most compelling reason for a long position in this area was the potential ?úbullish breaker??shown in pink. This was an area of supply that was blown through in a single candle. These zones are often retested as support - known as a bullish breaker when they are successful. I stopped out when the price failed to hold this level, at $7,900 for a position loss of roughly 1.4%.BTC USD 6 hour chart. Source: TradingViewI took another Bitcoin position at $7,420 when the price arrived at the next zone that I had outlined.

Therefore, these metrics must rise to produce an upward surge in Bitcoin?ôs price.Bitcoin: Adjusted Volume (Total).

Notice that this phenomenon is absent throughout 2019.Bitcoin: Spend Output Age Bands. Source: glassnode.comFurther proof that ??despite Bitcoin?ôs currently bearish price action ??interest in purchasing and holding grows comes from the adjusted spent output profit ratio (ASOPR) and the Spend Output Profit Ratio (SOPR).The ASOPR ignores all transaction outputs with a lifespan of less than one hour, whereas the SOPR calculates profit ratio by dividing the realized value of Bitcoin by its value at creation. As explained by SOPR creator Renato Shirakashi:?úSOPR appears to oscillate around the number 1. Secondly, during a bull market values of SOPR below 1 are rejected, while during a bear market values of SOPR above 1 are rejected.?ùBitcoin Adjusted Spent Output Profit Ratio.

As they realize their gains or prices increase, SOPR slowly recovers to 1.?ùGlassnode?ôs assessment makes perfect sense. Less than two weeks ago Bitcoin price skyrocketed from $7,400 to $10,540 and whether or not this was driven by President Xi Jinping?ôs blockchain announcement remains a topic of deliberation. But the profit-taking by short term investors and a drop in trading volume as sentiment and momentum wanes is to be expected.Bitcoin Spent Output Profit Ratio. Source: glassnode.comWhen set on the one-year time frame, using the 7-day moving average, traders can see that the significant dips below 1 on SOPR were all fantastic purchasing opportunities when the price peaked and began to curve above 1.01.This typically signaled that Bitcoin price rallies have become overextended and matching these dates against the traditional Heiken Ashi charts and oscillators like the relative strength index, stochastic RSI and the moving average confluence divergence showed overbought readings.According to the SOPR, even the most recent dip to $8,600 could have been a good time to ?úbuy the dip??and currently the SOPR line is beginning to curve up form 0.99561092 to reapproach 1.0 where it last was on Nov. 3 when the price was near $9,400.Ultimately, traders should pay more attention to the data produced by blockchains and consider incorporating some of the valuable data produced from on-chain activity to their trading routine.At the moment, the traditional Heiken Ashi charts suggest that Bitcoin is bearish over the short term but on-chain data tells a different story.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author (@HorusHughes) and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

While around fifty times lower at present, Lee thinks a reversal could come as soon as 2028.?úI predict the #flippening will happen within 9 years and $BTC will shoot up past USD $500,000,??he wrote.¬†Like many, Lee based his argument for Bitcoin?ôs success on its decreasing supply via block reward halvings.

Explaining his reasoning, Zhao explained how Beijing wants to push the influence of the renminbi globally in order to make it competitive with the U.S. dollar. He welcomed competition in the crypto world, saying: ?úHaving is better than not having. Having stablecoins is better than not having them.

The draft bill was expected to be introduced in parliament in the winter session that takes place between Nov. 18 and Dec. 13, but it has not been included in the agenda. Crypto businesses and consumers in the country have expressed concern because the law proposes jail terms of up to 10 years for those found dealing in digital currencies. Indian exchanges have welcomed the delay ??urging campaigners to forget competition and ego, and to present their case to regulators in a united fashion. Others have said the delay proves that the government is listening and potentially reevaluating its position.Konstantin Ignatov, the co-founder of the crypto scam OneCoin, has pleaded guilty to participating in the multibillion-dollar fraud.

Back when he first encountered the cryptocurrency in 2016, he writes:?úBitcoin had less than $20 billion in total value. I, a relatively small player in the bond market, was turning over $20 billion in Treasuries in just a few months.?ùCrucial to closing this gap ??to bring Bitcoin?ôs adoption to a level that can rival the Federal Reserve?ôs processing of $767 trillion via its wire system in one year ??Bhatia focuses on the functionality that Lightning Network brings to the cryptocurrency.As previously reported, the Lightning Network is a second-layer solution to Bitcoin?ôs scalability limitations, opening payment channels between users that keep the majority of transactions off-chain, turning to the underlying blockchain only to record the net results.Recognizing the potential of Bitcoin?ôs digital scarcity (and its resulting store-of-value properties) when combined with the functionality of Lightning-enabled fast transaction settlement prompted Bhatia to resolutely turn his back on his erstwhile Wall Street career.

a new niche for the investment possibilities. 6514 Total views.",18-Nov-19,"There is a lot of chatter going on about the uncertainties of cryptocurrency and how an attempt to tame the raging seas of the crypto market could spell doom for investors. As expected, in the middle of this conversation is Bitcoin (BTC), whose popularity continues to grow in the investment world.¬†","Although Bitcoin?ôs volatility is well-documented, this has not stopped investors from adopting cryptocurrencies as a way of effecting a diversified investment strategy. Interestingly, the volatility narrative is somewhat losing its potency as Bitcoin slowly establishes stability.Hence, I will use this piece to analyze the growing affinity for digital assets and how Bitcoin is fast becoming a viable investment asset class for institutional investors and family offices.The origin of Bitcoin might have caused many to doubt its efficacy. In a world grounded in a centralized culture, it is understandable that people would initially fight off an anomaly that could uproot the foundations of their belief system. At one point, people did not dare to imagine a world without a stratified institution made up of banks and governments that govern the dissemination of money and information. Now that decentralization is finding its way to even the most traditional industries, it is clear that crypto is here to stay.Nonetheless, there remains an ounce of doubt surrounding the viability of Bitcoin as an asset class. Some believe that Bitcoin emerged out of nothing. Therefore, it is impossible that the digital asset would retain its value. However, from my recent analysis of the history of money and the various theorems that established the origin of money, it is evident that Bitcoin fulfills the core requirements that other forms of money have passed.Interestingly, one could argue that the United States dollar, gold and other precious metals have no intrinsic worth ??market sentiments brought about their valuation.Institutional investors are aware of the risks that come with allocating a large percentage of their funds to a particular asset or market indices. For one, the downturn of such a market or asset would have a crippling effect on their returns. The same is true for investors that allocate the majority of their portfolio to asset classes that have strong correlations to one another. Hence, adopting a strategy that allows the allocation of funds to different asset classes, with little or no correlation, is the appropriate solution. This is where Bitcoin excels.VanEck¬†published a study that highlighted some of the factors that aided Bitcoin?ôs ascendancy as a viable investment product. One of these factors is the digital asset?ôs correlation to major market indices. In the study, VanEck noted that Bitcoin?ôs apparent disparity from established and emerging markets makes it a suitable portfolio diversification option.This argument holds after considering the correlation of Bitcoin to other markets from January 2012 to July 2019. While other markets had moderate correlations to one or two traditional asset classes, Bitcoin maintained a very weak correlation to all of the asset classes examined. In other words, Bitcoin could fit nicely into an investment portfolio and boost returns.VanEck?ôs study went further to prove Bitcoin?ôs eligibility as an investment option. This investigation entailed the assessment of the asymmetric return of portfolios allocated to varying percentages of equities, bonds and Bitcoin from January 2012 to July 2019. A portfolio with 58.5% of the fund distributed to equities, 38.5% to bonds and 0.5% to Bitcoin generated returns that surpassed that of a portfolio allocated solely to the S&P 500 by over 150% as of July 2019.From the basic principle of supply and demand, a commodity tends to retain or increase its value when its supply does not match its demand. In other words, maintaining or increasing the demand for an asset while reducing its supply would eventually cause the price of such an asset to skyrocket. This phenomenon has played out throughout the history of Bitcoin. Bitcoin?ôs protocol automatically¬†halves its supply roughly every four years. It is also important to note that it is only possible to create new coins, or mine, a maximum of 21 million BTC, and a total of 18 million BTC has already been mined.What all these facts and figures mean is that there is a possibility that the price of Bitcoin will continue to soar. And this might have spurred enthusiasts to predict ridiculous price possibilities. One popular crypto supporter in particular¬†asserted that the next halving, scheduled for May 2020, could cause one Bitcoin to sell for $1 million.Though this prediction sounds over the top, price history shows that the price of Bitcoin has always experienced a surge whenever the reward for finding new blocks undergoes a 50% cut. The last time this happened was in 2016, which led to the unprecedented bull run of 2017. Before this, a Bitcoin was selling for $657. Just over a year later, the price climbed to around $20,000 per coin. Without any doubt, the halving slated for the coming year will affect the price of Bitcoin. Although it is still unclear how much of an impact to expect, I bet that a majority of institutional investors will be closely watching the unfolding drama.Developers are beginning to understand that sustained adoption will never come to fruition until they resolve the issues battling the efficacy of blockchain?ôs scalability and security. Hence, the development recorded in this space is nothing short of remarkable. For one, the¬†Lightning Network, designed as a sidechain to the Bitcoin?ôs blockchain, could improve scalability and reduce the cost and time for transacting. This, and more, are some of the reasons why the prospect of Bitcoin?ôs adoption is looking good.For what it?ôs worth, the advantages of allocating a fraction of one?ôs investment portfolio to Bitcoin trump the disadvantages.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author?ôs alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.Constantin Kogan is a venture partner at BitBull Capital, a board member of ABOTMI and has been a cryptocurrency investor since 2012.

Meanwhile, Galaxy Institutional Bitcoin Fund has weekly liquidity and a higher initial threshold, the report notes.Both funds will reportedly charge lower fees than major Bitcoin funds such as the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust.Novogratz?ôs plans will ostensibly bring a significant amount of investment from older demographics as Bitcoin investment is specifically led by the tech-savvy younger generation in the 18??4 age range. Meanwhile, the share of American Bitcoin investors over 50 years old reportedly accounts for 3%.According to a recent study from wealth management firm United Income, Americans under 50 only hold 16% of all investable assets, compared with 31% in 1989. This leaves a massive amount of untapped wealth among older investors that, according to United Income, will comprise $36 trillion in inheritances in the next 30 years.Novogratz, a 54-year-old billionaire and known Bitcoin bull, claimed that there are probably 20 billionaires he could name that made their money outside of crypto and are in crypto now. He added that the new Bitcoin funds could attract investors who are now buying gold.Additionally, Novogratz said he expects that traditional financial services companies will let users invest in Bitcoin in the next 12 months.Earlier today, major Bitcoin fund Grayscale Bitcoin Trust filed Form 10 with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission to become the first crypto fund to report to the regulator. If the filing is approved. Grayscale could see its investor base widen, as more institutional investors will be able to dabble in Bitcoin.¬†",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Protestant Reformation and the present day ??do they have merit?",17-Nov-19,"A bit of historical research was making the rounds on social media recently, a monograph that compares the 21st century emergence of Bitcoin, encryption, the internet and millennials with the Protestant Reformation that shook Europe in the 16th and 17th centuries.¬†","The two events have similar dynamics, argues Tuur Demeester, whose white paper, ?úThe Bitcoin Reformation,??is packed with bold predictions about the crypto and blockchain future, such as, ?úBitcoin savers could accelerate a revolution in the history of thought.?ùThe report had 7,000 visits and was downloaded 2,800 times in the first 24 hours of its publishing, announced the author on Twitter on Nov. 8, adding, ?útranslations in French and Finnish on the way.??Demeester, a founding partner of Adamant Capital LP, also said:?úThe main thesis of ?òThe Bitcoin Reformation??is that there are four fundamental parallels between the Protestant Reformation and the present day, which could signal profound societal and economic changes ahead.?ùIt is worth enumerating these four conditions that ?úenabled??the reformation and may be present again today:In 16th century Europe, the Catholic Church was a monopolistic provider of spiritual services. The Church also commanded the legal system, ?úand controlled the keys to heaven via forgiveness of sin.?ù¬†Demeester compares the Church with the International Monetary and Financial System, which traces its origins back to the 1944 Bretton Woods agreement that replaced the gold standard with the United States dollar as the global currency. Central banks today, most prominently the U.S. Federal Reserve, control key parts of the legal system as well as ?úthe keys to the wealth and pensions of the world?ôs citizenry,??argues Demeester.¬†Sixteenth century Europe gave birth to a number of transformative technological inventions: The printing press, for instance, lowered the cost of a book from a year?ôs labor to the price of a chicken, notes Demeester, while other innovations like double-entry bookkeeping, the compass and the hourglass accelerated international commerce and exploration.The parallel is today?ôs digital revolution, including email, open-source software, cryptography, social media and the commoditization of computation and data storage.?úBoth times involved a new economic class with something to fight for,??writes the author. In the 16th and 17th centuries, it was a new merchant class trying to break the economic stranglehold of feudal landlords and the church. Today, it is a younger generation, the so-called millennials, who exhibit:¬†?úDistinct skepticism towards traditional finance, and enthusiastically embraces digital innovation. A 2016 survey by Facebook found that only 8% of millennials ?òtrust financial institutions for guidance,??and that 45% are ?òready to switch if a better option comes along.?ô‚ÄùA citizenry will be reluctant to challenge a domineering authority if they don?ôt have a means for defense and escape, argues Demeester, and during their revolt against their authoritarian, Catholic Spanish overlords at Alkmaar in 1573, the (Protestant) Dutch breached their dikes and flooded the countryside to raise the siege. They used this tactic repeatedly during their 80-year revolt. In the 21st century:?úThe defensive technological suite available for people who question the economic status quo is cryptography ??which can enable privacy and protection from asset seizure.?ùDemeeter?ôs monopolist comparison between the Catholic Church of 16th century Europe and the likes of the International Monetary Fund of today resonated with Richard Sylla, Professor Emeritus of Economics at NYU.¬†?úWe all know that banks charge you a lot for transferring money,??told Sylla to Cointelegraph. Bitcoin and other cryptos hold the promise of making overseas payments less expensive and more secure. Breaking the banks??so-called monopoly here would have benefits. But the Federal Reserve and its peer central banks aren?ôt likely to vanish anytime soon, Sylla said:¬†?úIt?ôs more likely the ?òmonopolists??will participate, with central banks establishing their own digital currency, either separately or collaboration with other countries. Most countries are still jealous of their sovereignty, including the right to print money, and central banks are carefully studying cryptocurrencies ??not just Bitcoin, whose price volatility makes it suspect as a currency.?ùNot all agree that the Protestant Reformation is the proper historical comparison for today?ôs financial services upheaval, or ?úthe most fundamental transformation in history,??as Nigel Green, founder and CEO of deVere Group, told Cointelegraph:?úI believe these contemporary changes are similar to other financial sector milestones, such as the Rothschild family establishing their banks in the late 18th century, the deregulation of the [financial services] sector in the 1980s, and the 2008 global financial crash. And it is fintech, in all its many forms including cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, that is fueling this.?ùDemeester is associated with the Austrian School of Economics, which some dismiss as ?úsimply a religion serving to justify libertarian policy conclusions.??One social media response to the The Bitcoin Reformation suggested:?úIf #crypto spent as much time turning decentralized immutable databases into useful products or services that we all want/need as they do trying to convert people to a religion of ?òsound money??that?ôs anything but, and wishing for the world to end so $BTC can be more valuable, that would be nice.?ùStill, Demeester?ôs 23-part Twitter summary of The Bitcoin Reformation prompted 435 retweets and over 1000 likes. Demeester ranks 5th on Hive?ôs list of top crypto ?úinfluencers,??and his tweetstorm may have fallen upon mostly sympathetic ears.¬†Although, in response to the author?ôs statement that ?úwe see broad parts of society, millennials especially, acting increasingly critical of central bank interventionism,??one dissenter replied, ?úI wish this were true, but don't see any evidence of it. I would guess 99% of millennials don't even know what a central bank is.??Another commented:¬†?úI?ôm struggling to see how you put millennials and Bitcoin into the same basket. Millennials tend to care the most of any generation about the environment. Bitcoin doesn't align with this.?ùCoinmetrics.io co-founder and Castle Island Ventures partner Nic Carter applauded Demeester for ?úrecognizing the higher role of private, non-state money ??as a significant social and political phenomenon,??he told Cointelegraph. The comparison with the Protestant revolution was useful in raising the Bitcoin conversation to its proper level, according to him. Carter went on to add that he found the white paper ?úquite compelling, refreshing???úToo often detractors dismiss it as a minor technological innovation, like an advance in database software, or just a more efficient way to do payment processing ??as opposed to an institutional revolution.?ùThere are no shortage of provocative comparisons of past and present in ?úThe Bitcoin Reformation.??Demeester describes how the Dutch Republic accessed capital through proto-annuities, and compares with today?ôs initial exchange offering tokens, which also tap the market for liquidity.¬†Each era has had its memes and slogans that drive the idea of cutting out the middleman. The Reformation?ôs ?úSola Fide??(faith alone is enough, no need for a priest) is paralleled by the Bitcoin era?ôs ?úVires in Numeris??(strength in numbers) and Tyler Winklevoss??quote, ?úWe have elected to put our money and faith in a mathematical framework that is free of politics and human error.?ù¬†The author offers seven ?úsuggested??conclusions ??predictions, really ??ranging from the momentous ?úBitcoin tolerance versus intolerance to become a major political faultline??to the circumscribed ?úInitial exchange offerings (IEOs) expected to stay and grow larger.??Unfortunately, these predictions aren?ôt really elaborated upon or supported in the report?ôs text. They rather seem to be food for future thought.The Protestant Reformation was a religious revolution. It essentially drove the Catholic Church out of most of Northern Europe. Bitcoin and its underlying blockchain technology may not rise to this level of social and economic upheaval.¬†Yes, the new technologies may supplant the ?úbanking monopoly??in some areas where it is arguably overcharging for its services, such as cross-border payments, but these are essentially tweaks, incremental improvements to the financial system.¬†By comparison, Bitcoin won?ôt stop the Federal Reserve from printing more U.S. dollars ??not anytime soon, anyway. The more likely scenario, as Sylla suggests, is the Fed co-opts digital currency, as Facebook is trying to do with Libra. This possibility isn?ôt considered in the report.Overall, though, as much as one might delight in historical analogies, the real problem, as the author of The Bitcoin Reformation himself acknowledges, is that secular trends are often only visible in hindsight.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

What followed was the very opposite of what the Argentine government had anticipated ??over the past two weeks, the country has traded the highest amount of Bitcoins on the peer-to-peer platform LocalBitcoins, according to data by CoinDance.","One of the biggest factors in the high adoption of crypto in the country is the high volatility of the Argentine peso. In just the past five years, the value of the peso against the United States dollar has fallen by over 85%.

The peso?ìdollar exchange rate is quoted daily by the media, alongside weather and traffic reports.Looking at the economic situation of Argentina, crypto bull Tim Draper advised the president of Argentina in March 2019 to legalize Bitcoin in order to improve the country?ôs economic situation. He counseled the president on crypto?ôs potential to improve the devaluation of the Argentine peso and relieve the associated brain drain.¬†Daniel Popa, CEO of the Anchor stablecoin, told Cointelegraph that despite the volatility of crypto, Argentinians trust it more as a store of value than the peso because Bitcoin cannot be manipulated by the government, adding that:?úUnfortunately, bitcoin does not offer predictability, underlining the ongoing need for a universally-accepted stablecoin and financial standard that could be adopted by anyone in the world, including those suffering from the negative economic impacts that stem from war, natural disasters, health crises, and disruptive monetary policies.?ùTo give some historical context, in the 1990s, the peso was pegged to the dollar by the government of President Carlos Menem in an attempt to stifle inflation. The dollar peg damaged exports, pushing the state to take on more debt to remain afloat amid a worsening economic crisis. The peg was lifted in 2002. However, the dollar had already been ingrained in Argentine culture.On Sept. 1, the Central Bank of Argentina had imposed restrictions on U.S. dollar purchases to revive the plunging peso. Citizens??purchases made in dollars were limited to $10,000 a month, requiring special permissions beyond that limit. The bank also said it would restrict dollar purchases to $200 per month via bank account and just $100 per month in cash, until December.Talking to Cointelegraph about the government?ôs crackdown on forex, Salomon Ptit Haddad, the head of institutional sales at Enigma Securities, said, ?úGiven the current degree of uncertainty, the BCRA board of directors decided to take a series of measures that seek to preserve the reserves of the Central Bank.??Haddad went on to add:?úThe Argentine Central Bank can easily impose restrictive measures on the use of bank cards, with local banks having to comply with the guidelines imposed by the country?ôs central bank. Argentina, which has a $50 billion debt to the IMF and is trying to get out of the economic problems it is facing.?ùKeeping up with the trend to increase the adoption of peso, the Central Bank of Argentina announced on Oct. 31 that citizens are prohibited from using credit cards to buy cryptocurrencies. Haddad believes that this regulatory policy is aimed at protecting the national currency at the cost of crypto, since Argentine citizens tend to exchange crypto back into the dollar either offshore or in the country.¬†He also added that since November this year, the BCA has mandated all card issuers to be registered prior to distributing new cards, ?úThis has generated great uncertainty within the South American country, where it is customary to have cash and dispense with banking systems.??Haddad went on to add:?úNow, after this measure, the cryptocurrencies can be a way to preserve assets for those who want to save, bearing in mind that the origin of people looking for a stronger asset is the devaluation of the local currency, which has been devalued by 50% so far this year.?ùWe have seen it time and again in countries like India and China, where crypto trading volumes surge upward following a ban. Talking about how this move led to an increased interest in crypto, the co-founder and chief operations officer at ShapeShift exchange, who simply goes by ?úJon,??said:?úCapital controls seem to have a direct correlation with getting people more interested in Bitcoin because it?ôs something the government can?ôt control. The population of the country sees these capital controls are put in place and then they?ôre going to look for a way around it. That?ôs where Bitcoin and crypto come in, as they give a good way to store and transfer values when they?ôre dealing with this type of uncertainty.?ùArgentina?ôs deputy minister of finance, Felix Martin Soto, claimed in March this year that the government should approach crypto and blockchain tech as a way to improve Argentina?ôs financial inclusion and reduce state costs.He had also asserted that promoting the crypto industry in the nation will serve to reduce its demand for dollars, which will ultimately commit to preserving the local market and attracting global investment.¬†Soto is not the only one who is pro-crypto. Upon being elected in 2015, President Mauricio Macri was perceived to be good news for the legal status of Bitcoin in the country. He was the one to sponsor the First Bitcoin Forum in Buenos Aires in July 2015. Although, his enthusiasm for cryptos didn?ôt seem to last for too long. Jon gave two reasons as to why the president slowed his fondness toward crypto:??) It?ôs hard to focus on Bitcoin regulation while trying to keep the government stable and national currency inflation down so people can afford to live; and 2) he?ôs probably running into bureaucratic pushback for various reasons.?ùApart from the forum, there have been other initiatives by organizations to spread crypto awareness. For example, nonprofit organizations Bitcoin Argentina and Bitcoin Americana launched an informational campaign called ?úBitcoineta.??It consisted of a Bitcoin-branded van, jointly purchased by the two organizations, that went around Argentina to spread basic knowledge about cryptocurrencies among local communities.2018?ôs edition of G-20, which was coincidently held in Argentina, mentioned crypto regulation. The officials stated their concerns regarding the crypto industry as well as their overall agenda for both the future and infrastructure development of the participating nations.The conclusion of the summit saw a declaration titled, ?úBuilding Consensus for Fair and Sustainable Development,??which regards cryptocurrencies as an important part of an ?úopen and resilient financial system??that ?úis crucial to support sustainable growth.?ù¬†The document also highlights the necessities of Anti-Money Laundering and anti-terrorist measures as per the standards of the Financial Action Task Force, providing clear instructions to participating nations on crypto regulation.Related: FATF AML Regulation: Can the Crypto Industry Adapt to the Travel Rule?However, Argentina itself didn?ôt make much of an effort to regulate digital assets. The Argentine government has not implemented specific regulations on exchange, issuance or ??in general ??the use of digital assets. Regarding the Argentine government?ôs failure to take swift action on the regulatory front, Shapeshift?ôs Jon said:?úIt?ôs hard to fully know why that didn?ôt happen, but my best guess is that the crypto regulation discussion got caught up in bureaucratic priorities. Unless the government, any government, really makes something a priority, other things just take precedence. I doubt there?ôs specific intent around not regulating crypto, rather it?ôs something they?ôve just not gotten to yet.?ùArgentina is the textbook example of how Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies can find a use as a store of value, especially in economically vulnerable nations. If the government is serious about reducing their dependence on the U.S. dollar, it is becoming more apparent that they should embrace and understand crypto. Early adoption of digital currencies could help the country come out of its financial downturn.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Coincidentally, regulators start looking to apply more scrutiny.",21-Nov-19,"Earlier this week, the number of Bitcoin (BTC) ATMs installed worldwide reached a new milestone, surpassing 6,000. Coincidentally, another major development just a day before occurred within the same area: The United States Internal Revenue Service said it was looking into potential tax issues caused by such ATMs and kiosks.","This development might allow the IRS to succeed in mitigating the use cryptocurrency for large-scale federal tax non-compliance, experts suggest. However, Bitcoin ATMs remain a low-transaction-size business which is already regulated enough to detect high-scale fraud.¬†The world?ôs first-ever Bitcoin ATM opened in October 2013 at Waves Coffee House in Vancouver?ôs downtown area, while the first machine in the United States went online in February 2014 in Albuquerque, New Mexico (although, it was removed 30 days later).¬†Since then, Bitcoin ATMs have grown into a multi-million-dollar industry, as the companies who operate the machines collect sizeable fees (reportedly around 8.93%). For instance, Cottonwood, a firm that controlled 91 machines in New York as of December 2018, had a gross annual revenue ostensibly exceeding $35 million ?î¬?about $385,000 in cash per machine ??and just 13 employees, as per a Bloomberg investigation.According to data from online resource CoinATMRadar, the U.S. currently has the most Bitcoin ATMs in the world. More specifically, there are 3924 machines installed across the country, accounting for over 65% of the world?ôs total Bitcoin ATMs. Moreover, the industry continues to develop at a rapid pace: Over 130 machines have been deployed this month alone, while the average daily number of Bitcoin ATMs installed is fluctuating at around seven.As it tends to happen within most booming industries, sooner or later, regulators start to apply more scrutiny. On Nov. 15, the IRS Criminal Investigation Chief, John Fort, said that his agency is collaborating with law enforcement to investigate illicit uses of cryptocurrency through kiosks, stating:?úIf you can walk in, put cash in and get bitcoin out, obviously we?ôre interested potentially in the person using the kiosk and what the source of the funds is, but also in the operators of the kiosks.?ùFort explained that such services are required to conform to Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering rules: ?úThey?ôre required to abide by the same know-your-customer, anti-money laundering regulations, and we believe some have varying levels of adherence to those regulations.??The IRS executive added that although the regulators haven?ôt had any public cases filed, they ?údo have open cases in inventory??related to cryptocurrency tax issues.So how exactly is the industry regulated in the U.S.? It seems to fall into a grey area of the law. Cal Evans, founder of compliance and strategy firm Gresham International, told Cointelegraph:?úMost Bitcoin ATM owners that are trying to follow the rules, as much as possible, are relying on Money Transmitter laws. We see this strategy deployed with the bigger firms such as Coinbase. These laws differ from state to state with the USA, with the most notable exception being the state of New York where parties are required to own one of the notorious ?òBitcoin??Licenses to conduct this business.?ù¬†Thus, there are two levels of regulation: federal and state. As CEO of CoinATMRadar Matthew Hayes told Cointelegraph, the former is ?úsimilar in all the states and quite straightforward,??and aims to prevent illicit activities such as money laundering and tax evasion. State-level regulation, however, differs:¬†?úSome states have relaxed rules and allow quite easy access to start such a business. In other states, there might be high requirements to operate incl. large size surety bonds and costly licenses.?ùThus, unlike traditional ATM operators, Bitcoin ATM operators are typically treated as Money Services Businesses that have to operate under Money Transmitter Licenses, the requirements for which vary by state, as Zachary Kelman, managing partner at Kelman.law, summed up in a conversation with Cointelegraph. However, there are some exceptions among more crypto-friendly states that differ from New York and Florida regulations:?úOn the other end of the spectrum are states that are far more Bitcoin ATM-friendly ??for example, the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities has determined that cryptocurrency transactions are exempt from money transmitter rules, and the Wyoming legislature enacted a law exempting cryptocurrency businesses from MSB licensing requirements.?ùAndrew Barnard, co-founder of Bitcoin ATM firm Bitstop, added that many states, including California, have still not made up their minds in regard to Bitcoin ATMs or do not require a Money Transmitter License as long as the crypto sold through the ATMs is a two-party transaction. He elaborated to Cointelegraph:¬†?úStates like Texas and others do not require a money transmitter license if you are selling your own Bitcoin to the person in front of the machine as opposed to just sending the Bitcoin directly from an exchange to the customer which would make it a three party transaction.?ùSome other hindrances come with the lack of more clear-cut regulations, albeit less major. For instance, companies have difficulties with obtaining local city permits for Bitcoin ATMs, which is why they are usually installed in private establishments, Evans observed.Indeed, as the Bloomberg investigation argued, most crypto kiosks in the U.S. tend to be located in corner shops, cigar bars and casinos. Nevertheless, there are some noticeable exceptions: Earlier this month, Bitstop installed one of its machines at the Miami International Airport, one of the largest airline hubs in the country.Related: US Crypto Review: Top-5 States With Welcoming RegulationsAs for the regulations, it seems that industry players do have concrete guidance to follow despite the juridical uncertainty that experts highlight. ?úFinCEN has been clear since 2013 about the KYC/BSA/AML requirements for cryptocurrency exchangers,??said Max Lopez, marketing director at Coin Cloud ??a company that operates as a licensed Money Service Business and hosts over 350 cryptocurrency kiosks across the U.S.¬†?úWe only know the regulations we are following and can not speak for others in the cryptocurrency kiosk industry,??Lopez added, drawing a line between large businesses and smaller players. ?úIt?ôs important to separate individual companies and not place them all under one umbrella as you have regional, hobbyist and ?òmom and pop??operators with one machine.?ùBarnard of Bitstop confirms that larger companies follow the same rules within the Bitcoin ATM industry. ?úThe top legitimate operators in the space are registered with FinCEN on a federal level and maintain a AML/BSA compliance program which should be tested and updated regularly (once a year),??he told Cointelegraph, adding:?úIt?ôs not that difficult to be registered on a federal level.?ùThe IRS should have a ?úprobable cause??or ?úreasonable belief??to delve into the Bitcoin ATM industry, according to Evans. As of now, ?úsimply using the Bitcoin ATMs itself is in no way a crime,??the expert stressed, especially if the vendor is following MTLs and users are declaring their transactions to the IRS:?úLet?ôs paint a scenario, if you are a Bitcoin ATM user in the US (which is totally legal), and you declare those transactions on your tax return (as now required), the IRS could be in breach of constitutional rights by investigating the individual. Essentially, the IRS should not be able to tax activity it then deems as ?òillegal??activity after the fact. Otherwise, where do we draw the line? Do we begin taxing drug dealers??ùNevertheless, the IRS has been historically slow to act, which also suggests that the industry is far from being radically changed by the tax regulator, Evans adds. Kelman, however, envisions certain changes that might come with the IRS statement. He told Cointelegraph that some of their Bitcoin ATM operator clients had already engaged with the IRS:¬†¬†?úThe IRS has been amenable to these clients and their businesses, asking for and accepting without issue the Bitcoin ATM users??Know Your Customer (KYC) information, which is collected to the extent possible by Bitcoin ATM operators per compliance with MSB rules.?ùKelman explained that while his firm does not expect Bitcoin kiosk owners to close down in light of this development, they do expect changes to which the kiosk operators must respond, such as collecting KYC data from any user whose transactions require Currency Transaction Reports or Suspicious Activity Reports filings:?úThe Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) already requires MSBs to file Currency Transaction Reports (CTRs) on all transactions in excess of $10,000 and Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) for any and all suspicious transactions ??or sequences of transactions ??over $2,000.?ùKelman believes that the statement from the IRS will prompt users to conduct smaller transactions beneath the KYC limit. In his opinion, the IRS ?úwill be able to greatly mitigate efforts to use cryptocurrency for large-scale federal tax non-compliance,??while small-scale tax cheats will likely stay under the radar.¬†Indeed, larger operators seem unfazed by the news. Both Coin Cloud and Bitstop representatives told Cointelegraph that business remains as usual for smaller Bitcoin ATM owners while they aren?ôt being forced to either become fully compliant or shut down.Even if smaller players choose to play by the rules, they might still have to shut shop over time due to the costs associated with maintaining a thorough compliance program, Bitstop?ôs Barnard added. He also told Cointelegraph:?úMr Fort is reasonable when he says there is most likely a high variance of compliance and adherence to regulations from operator to operator. This is true because there are different Bitcoin ATM hardware models that have different software stacks and perform compliance differently. Not all operators are created equal. There?ôs a lot of good guys, but our industry does have its own share of bad apples.?ùAs Evans of Gresham International told Cointelegraph, physical ATM machines harness a large amount of data about their users, such as card used, PIN number attempts, speed of PIN entry, date, time, transaction sizes, and pictures of their face. ?úThe main concern the IRS has with the Bitcoin ATMs, is that some of these machines do not collect ANY data,??he said:¬†?úIf we compare this, for example, to online exchanges (those which allow US citizens and residents to use them), they are required to keep accurate data on the users, which the IRS and other law enforcement bodies can then use to track the movement of funds.?ùNevertheless, Bitcoin ATMs controlled by large operators claim that they collect a considerable amount of data about their clients as per current regulations concerning Anti-Money Laundering and the Bank Secrecy Act. ?úAs a registered MSB with FinCEN, Coin Cloud is required to keep customer KYC and transactional data for at least 5 years,??Lopez told Cointelegraph. ?úAll cryptocurrency kiosk companies can be subpoenaed at any time for the records they keep.?ùBarnard said that although KYC collection can vary depending on how much the customer wants to buy or sell. ?úFor lower amounts under $150, a phone number, name and address may be reasonable,??the Bitstop representative told Cointelegraph, adding that they limit all of their customers to purchase no more than $3,000 per person per day.¬†?úEven then, less than 5% of our customer base will use that limit,??he continued. ?úThe average purchase from our Bitstop Bitcoin ATMs is $180 per person.

Speaking with Cointelegraph in August, Timothy Paolini, a board member at NYU Blockchain, stated:?úBlockchains are built around the principles of decentralization, removing the single point of failure risk (think Equifax servers) and cutting out unnecessary third parties by establishing a more direct, peer-to-peer network. This also maintains your privacy and control of your data from third-party apps as data rests at the protocol instead of the application layer.?ùDeirdre K. Mulligan, an assistant professor at the University of California, Berkeley School of Information, argued that blockchains do not inherently protect your identity, as they can be manipulated by their architects to be centralized and non-anonymous. Mulligan stated:?úCompanies can exert a lot of control over how they design an application, through its architecture, default settings, what it communicates in its privacy policies, and what it does in practice. The value for a consumer concerned about her privacy would depend on the blockchain application and the kind of data collected and processed by it.??

In reality, however, it is almost mathematically impossible that the same miner would unlock the block reward for so many blocks in a row.Nodes can be left behind during hard forks for various reasons, often due to accidentally forgetting to upgrade before the block set to trigger the hard fork.¬†The inefficiency nonetheless piled publicity on Bitcoin Cash and major proponent Roger Ver. Ver, in particular, has become a highly controversial figure in cryptocurrency due to his arguably unsuccessful campaign to plant BCH as a superior alternative to BTC.¬†Pro-Bitcoin figures took Ver?ôs allies to task on social media. These included Olivier Janssens, who previously argued that a node ?údoesn?ôt matter??in a decentralized peer-to-peer network and that removing Bitcoin?ôs block size cap was, therefore, essential to avoid hostile takeovers.The hard fork meanwhile failed to lift the poor performance of BCH/USD, which has shed around 3.2% in the 24 hours since the hard fork.

This is because the markets lack a catalyst that can either pull prices higher or plunge them lower.¬†,"However, a developing catalyst could be the launch of the China-backed central bank digital currency (CBDC). Jack Lee, a founding partner at HCM Capital, believes that China?ôs central bank is ready and the digital currency could be launched within the next two to three months. If this experiment is successful, it would likely force the other developed nations to follow suit.Daily cryptocurrency market performance. Source: Coin360Another catalyst that could prove bullish for the crypto market is the continuous inflow of institutional money. However, this has not yet materialized due to a variety of reasons. Bakkt has announced that it has received approval from the New York Department of Financial Services to offer crypto custody services to any institution. Bakkt expects this move to increase institutional adoption.However, not everyone is bullish on the crypto space. The European Central Bank?ôs former president Jean-Claude Trichet is ?ústrongly against Bitcoin??and does not consider it as a currency.¬†¬†¬†Therefore the question must be asked. Should traders view the current dip in Bitcoin price as a buying opportunity, or can the leading cryptocurrency surprise investors with additional moves to the downside? Let?ôs study the charts to see what signals the market is providing.Bitcoin (BTC) attempted to rebound off the critical support at $8,777.89 on Nov. 10 but the bounce fizzled out just above the $9,080 mark. This shows that higher levels are attracting profit booking.¬†¬†¬†Currently, the price has again dipped to the support at $8,777.89. If this level fails to hold, the BTC/USD pair could dip to $8,467.54, which is 61.8% retracement of the most recent up move. This is an important level to watch out for because if it cracks, a drop to $7,297.21 is possible.Conversely, if the pair bounces off the 50-day SMA, the bulls will again attempt to clear the downtrend line and retest the recent highs of $10,360.89. We will wait for the pair to breakout and close (UTC time) above the downtrend line before recommending a trade.For the past few days, Ether (ETH) has been trading within the intraday high and intraday low made on Oct. 26. A breakout of $197.75 will be a positive move that can carry the price to the overhead resistance zone of $223.999 to $235.70.¬†Conversely, if the bears sink the price below the support at $173.841, it can decline to $161.056-$151.829 support zone. If this zone holds, the ETH/USD pair might remain range-bound for a few more days.¬†Our view will be invalidated if the pair breaks below $151.829. In such a case, the downtrend will resume. Therefore, traders can protect the long positions with stops at $150.XRP is looking weak as it hardly bounced after the steep fall on Nov. 7 and 8. This shows that the bulls are not using the dips to buy as they expect the price to slide further. The next support to watch on the downside is $0.24508. If this support also cracks, a retest of $0.22 will be on the cards. Therefore, traders can protect their long positions with stops at $0.24.Contrary to our assumption, if the XRP/USD pair reverses direction from the current levels and breaks out of $0.31491, it can rally to $0.34229. However, with the moving averages starting to turn down and the RSI in the negative territory, advantage is with the bears and a rally looks unlikely.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has again hit a wall close to the neckline of the head and shoulders pattern. This suggests that the bears are aggressively defending this resistance level. If the price slips below the 20-day EMA, it can decline to $241.85. Therefore, traders can trail the stop loss on the long positions to $267.¬†However, if the BCH/USD pair turns up from the current level and sustains above the neckline, it can rise to $360. This is a significant resistance, hence, traders can book partial profits closer to $360 and keep a close stop loss on the rest of the position.¬†Litecoin (LTC) is struggling to find buyers above $62.0764. It has again dipped to the 20-day EMA. If the bears sink the price below the moving averages, the altcoin can drop to the critical support at $50. A breakdown of $47.1851 will be a huge negative and will resume the downtrend.However, if the support at $50 holds, a few days of consolidation is possible. The flattening moving averages and the RSI just above 50 level also suggests a range formation.Alternatively, if the LTC/USD pair bounces off the moving averages and rises above $66.1486, it can move up to $80.2731. The traders can protect their long positions with stops at $47. We shall trail the stops higher at the first available opportunity.EOS is sandwiched between 20-day EMA and $3.69 for the past few days. The bears are aggressively defending the downtrend line. If the altcoin breaks below $3.3137, a drop to $2.9980 is likely. A break below this level will be a huge negative as it can drag the price to $2.4001.¬†Conversely, if the EOS/USD pair bounces off the 20-day EMA and breaks out of the downtrend line, it is likely to pick up momentum and rally to $4.24 and above it to $4.8719. Traders can continue to hold their long positions with a stop loss of $2.95.Binance Coin (BNB) has been trading between the 20-day EMA and $21.2378 for the past few days. A breakout of $21.2378 can push the price to $23.5213 and above it to $30. However, if the bears sink the price below the 20-day EMA, a drop to the 50-day SMA is likely.The 50-day SMA, the horizontal support and the uptrend line are all situated close to each other. Hence, we expect the bulls to defend it aggressively. If the BNB/USD pair bounces off this support, it will consolidate between $18.30 and $21.2378 for a few days.¬†The pair will turn negative if it breaks down of the critical support and re-enters the channel. For now, traders can keep the stop loss on the long positions at $16. We will recommend trailing the stops higher within the next few days.Bitcoin SV (BSV) is trading inside a channel that is descending down marginally. The next decisive move will start after the price escapes the channel. If the bulls manage to push the price above the channel, a move to $188.69 is likely. Though there is a resistance at $155.38, we expect it to be crossed.Conversely, if the price breaks down of the channel, a drop to $107 is possible. The short-term traders can buy on a bounce off the support line of the channel and book profits closer to the resistance line of the channel. However, we suggest positional traders wait until the BSV/USD pair breaks out and closes (UTC time) above the channel for establishing any positions.¬†Stellar (XLM) bounced sharply from the 20-day EMA in the past two days. However, it is facing profit booking just above the $0.080 mark. This shows that bulls are keen to buy on dips to strong support levels and the bears are attempting to defend the overhead resistance levels. This could result in a consolidation for a few days until one party emerges victorious.The critical level to watch on the upside is $0.088708. If this level is scaled, the XLM/USD pair can move up to $0.145. On the other hand, if the pair breaks below the 20-day EMA, it can drop to the 50-day SMA. We do not find any buy setup that offers an attractive risk to reward ratio, hence, we suggest traders remain on the sidelines.Tron (TRX) has been clinging to the support for the past three days. However, the failure to bounce off it indicates a lack of urgency among buyers. If the bears sink the price below $0.0183603, a drop to the 50-day SMA is likely.Both moving averages are flattening out and the RSI has dipped close to the midpoint. This suggests a consolidation for a few days.However, if the TRX/USD pair bounces off the current levels and breaks above $0.0204880, it can move up to $0.02340. We will turn positive above $0.0204880. Until then, we remain neutral on the pair.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

Bitcoin has been gradually declining, which has also pulled altcoins also lower.¬†However, an interesting development is that a few altcoins are attempting to form a bottom. Let?ôs have a look at the charts to determine which are moving higher and what are the critical levels to watch out for?Bitcoin (BTC) has been trading below the 50-day SMA for the past two days. This is a negative sign and it shows that there is no urgency among the bulls to buy even at these levels. The 20-day EMA has started to turn down and the relative strength index (RSI) has dipped into negative territory, which suggests that bears have the upper hand.A decisive breakdown below the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of $8,467.54 is likely to attract further selling that can drag the price to $7,952.84.Conversely, if the BTC/USD pair bounces off the current levels and breaks out of the downtrend line, it will signal that the current fall was a bear trap. We anticipate the pair to start a new uptrend above the downtrend line. Therefore, we will wait for the price to breakout and close (UTC time) above the downtrend line before turning positive.¬†While several cryptocurrencies are breaking below their support levels, Ether (ETH) remains stable. This is a positive sign as it shows that the bulls are not hurrying to close their positions. Both moving averages are flat and the RSI is close to the center, which indicates that the range-bound action might continue for a few more days.Longer the consolidation, stronger will be the eventual breakout or breakdown from it. We anticipate the next move to be a strong one.If the price breaks out of the overhead resistance at $197.75, a rally to $235.70 will be on the cards. On the other hand, if the bears sink the price below $173.841, a retest of $161.056 to $151.829 support zone is likely. The downtrend will resume on a break below this zone. Therefore, traders can continue to hold their long positions with stops at $150.The attempt to pullback on Nov. 15 did not find buyers at higher levels. As a result, XRP has resumed its journey towards the next support at $0.24508. The moving averages have completed a bearish crossover and the RSI continues to trade in the negative zone, which shows that bears are firmly in command.A break below $0.24508 will be a huge negative that can drag the price to the next support at $0.22. Hence, traders can retain a stop loss on the long positions at $0.24.Conversely, if the XRP/USD pair bounces off the support at $0.24508, the bulls will try to push it above the moving averages. If successful, it will remain range-bound between $0.24508 and $0.31491 for the next few days.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has been trading below the 20-day EMA and the previous support turned resistance of $269.10 for the past two days. The attempt by the bulls to scale above this resistance failed on Nov. 17. This shows a lack of demand at higher levels.The next support on the downside is at the 50-day SMA and below it $241.85. We anticipate the bulls to defend this level aggressively. If this support holds, the bulls will again attempt to carry the BCH/USD pair above the overhead resistance at $269.10.Conversely, if the support at $241.85 breaks down, the pair might slip to the next support at $203.36. We will wait for the price to signal a turn around before recommending a long position once again.Litecoin (LTC) has been stuck between its moving averages for the past three days. This tight range trading shows that both bulls and bears are playing it safe and are not taking any directional bets.Above the 20-day EMA, the LTC/USD pair will again hit a wall in the $62.0764 to $66.1486 resistance zone. The pair will pick up momentum on a breakout of $66.1486Conversely, if the bears sink the price below the 50-day SMA, a drop to the $50 - $47.1851 support zone is possible. If this zone breaks down, the downtrend will resume. Therefore, traders can retain the stop loss on the long positions at $47.EOS has been trading close to the critical support at $3.37 for the past few days. Though the price dipped below the support on Nov. 15, the bears could not capitalize on it. This shows buying at lower levels.Both the moving averages are flat and the RSI is just above the midpoint, which suggests a balance between both bulls and bears.¬†The balance will tilt in favor of the bulls if the EOS/USD pair climbs above $3.69 and the downtrend line. Alternatively, the bears will have the upper hand if the price sustains below $3.37. For now, the traders can keep the stop loss on the long positions at $2.95.The failure of the bulls to defend the 20-day EMA is a bearish sign. Binance Coin (BNB) can now dip to the 50-day SMA, which is just above the uptrend line and the horizontal support at $18.30.We expect the bulls to defend this support aggressively. If the altcoin bounces off this support, the bulls will again try to propel the price above the overhead resistance of $21.2378.¬†Conversely, if the bears sink the BNB/USD pair below the uptrend line, a drop to the next support at $16.50 is possible. If this support also breaks down, a decline to $14.2555 is likely. For now, traders can protect their long positions with stops at $16. We could suggest closing the position if the pair dips below $18.30.Bitcoin SV (BSV) has been trading below the 20-day EMA for the past three days but the bears have not been able to break below the descending channel. The bulls are attempting to provide some support close to $120 levels. The 20-day EMA is flat and the RSI is just below the 50 level, which suggests a range-bound action for a few more days.If the bulls can push the price above the 20-day EMA, a retest of the resistance line of the descending channel is likely. A breakout of the channel will be the first indication that bulls are back in command.Conversely, if the BSV/USD pair slides below the minor support at $120, a dip to $107 is possible. We will wait for a new buy setup to form before proposing a trade in it.Stellar (XLM) has broken below a slew of support levels, which is a bearish sign. It shows that sellers are dominating the proceedings. The next stop is likely to be the 50-day SMA, which is located just below the horizontal support of $0.067457. If this support also fails to hold, a drop to $0.062122 and below it to $0.056 is possible.However, if the XLM/USD pair finds support close to the 50-day SMA, the bulls will again attempt to climb above the support turned resistance of $0.072545. The flattish 20-day EMA and the RSI just below the 50 suggests further range-bound action for a few days. We will wait for the pair to signal a reversal before recommending a trade in it.After trading close to the critical support at $0.018660 for the past two days, Tron (TRX) has resumed its decline. Its next stop is likely to be the 50-day SMA. If the 50-day SMA holds, we might see another attempt by the bulls to make a recovery above $0.018660.However, if the 50-day SMA breaks, the TRX/USD pair can plummet to the next support at $0.0136655. Such a move will be a huge negative and will weaken sentiment further. Therefore, we will wait for the price to signal a turn around before suggesting a trade in it.¬†The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

At that time Bitcoin was still moving towards an all-time-high.¬†Longhash?ôs data seems to indicate that Tether has a chance to manipulate the markets when BTC is in a downward price trend, as it shot up significantly during the bear market, reaching its peak at the end of 2018. The researchers said:?úThis suggests that even if Tether were indeed manipulating the market, its ability to do so actually is strongest when the Bitcoin price falls. This contradicts the claim that Tether issuance drove the 2017 bull market. The supply of Tether actually failed to keep up during the height of the bull market.?ùThe recently updated academic paper titled ?úIs Bitcoin Really Un-Tethered???suggested that one single player or entity was allegedly responsible for Bitcoin?ôs historic price surge at the end of 2017. According to the paper, the Tether stablecoin and its issuer Bitfinex played a key role in the alleged hoax.Bitfinex denied all allegations, calling the publication ?úa transparent attempt to use the semblance of academia for a mercenary money grab.??Many analysts agree and laugh off the single whale theory, saying that while the crypto market is not immune to manipulation, to assume that someone could single-handedly drive the prices up to such an extent is quite a stretch.Juan Villaverde and Martin Weiss of Weiss Ratings agency called it ?úpreposterous??when speaking with Cointelegraph, adding:?úThere is abundant anecdotal evidence that throws great doubt on the one-large-player theory. For example, exchanges were swamped and not able to onboard new customers. Google searches for ?úBitcoin??and ?úcryptocurrency??were off the charts. New crypto businesses and ICOs were popping up every day. All of this ??and more ??suggests that the crypto surge of 2017 was very much a mass phenomenon, with heavy public participation.??

transfer system built on blockchain as well as the fact that Chinese ...",14-Nov-19,"Earlier this week, a story published by Chinese state-run media outlet Xinhua featured some pro-Bitcoin comments that referred to the flagship digital currency as being the world?ôs ?úfirst successful application of blockchain technology.??,This latest endorsement comes against the backdrop of China?ôs stringent anti-crypto stance", wherein the country?ôs lawmakers implemented a blanket ban on its local cryptocurrency exchanges as well as initial coin offerings back in 2017.The aforementioned Xinhua article takes a balanced approach toward crypto tech, outlining the history of Bitcoin?ôs development and its overall evolution. It starts off by asking readers the question ?úDoes BTC present the global finance industry with an inevitable trend as far as future currency development goes or is the digital asset just another ?òtulip??hype??ù¬†The piece then proceeds to describe the core tenets of blockchain and how such a decentralized, immutable and trustless technology can be used to facilitate value transfers in a completely peer-to-peer manner. Additionally, it also covers other relevant aspects related to crypto such as mining, digital scarcity and pseudonymity.However, similar to most Western media coverage of cryptocurrencies, the piece then starts to devolve into a sweeping tirade of how Bitcoin is mostly being used by criminals and other nefarious individuals to facilitate black market and darknet transactions ??a notion that has been debunked several times over in the past. Not only that, but Xinhua?ôs writing staff also goes on to highlight the volatility of Bitcoin, citing its lack of central backing as being one of its core weaknesses.To better assess the implications of China?ôs apparent change of heart toward blockchain tech and Bitcoin, Cointelegraph reached out to Matvey Voytov, the chief marketing officer of Waves Enterprise, a private blockchain solution designed to compete with existing DLT platforms. He believes that China is likely to become the most active blockchain market in the world, as it looks to spend $2 billion on projects by 2023. Voytov further added:?úYou can?ôt ignore Bitcoin as being the most successful case of a value transfer system built on blockchain as well as the fact that Chinese investors control a significant part of today?ôs global bitcoin operations. Still, it doesn?ôt mean that in the near future China will change its stance on the trading of cryptocurrencies that are not under their control.?ùSimilarly, Peter Somerville, head of node and developer relations for blockchain platform Elixxir, told Cointelegraph that he too is quite optimistic about the future of crypto and blockchain in China. He pointed out that owing to the country?ôs massive 1.4 billion strong population, there will always be a huge appetite for real-world crypto and blockchain use cases in the region.¬†Additionally, he believes that since the Chinese tech community has played a meaningful role in the development of the industry from its very inception, the local market will soon change its mode of operation from a phase of hype and speculation to laying greater emphasis on projects that seek to innovate and build platforms in order to promote general adoption of these technologies.Lastly, Andre Szykier, the chief technology officer Bitcoin ATM operator Blockchain BTM, told Cointelegraph that with China is seemingly committed to creating a gold-backed security token offering with a stated reserve of 13,000 tons ??similar to what Russia has proposed for the ruble.¬†On the topic of Chinese-owned media outlets appearing to tone down their erstwhile stringent opposition to things like Bitcoin mining and speculative cryptocurrency trading, Szykier made an observation that gambling is a fundamental characteristic of social behavior in China, adding that, ?úSince the government has gone forward in creating a ?òsocial score??to reward or punish behavior in the country, cryptocurrency speculation falls into this area.??Szykier concluded:?úBy controlling the buy/sell activity they can identify and control participants. How this affects the top tier individuals with very large wealth is TBD. The future of retail commerce in China is heavily mobile with ease of interchange between various payment systems highly advanced. By making paper/coin payments a smaller part of retailing, the government can monitor their citizens more closely and perhaps impact their social score.?ùIn order to gauge whether local sentiment toward crypto and blockchain technology in China has actually changed since the 2017 blanket ban came into effect, Cointelegraph reached out to Alex Lam, CEO and co-founder of digital asset services platform RockX.¬†In his view, the Chinese government?ôs ban ??which, at the time, was in response to an increasing amount of unregulated crypto market activity taking place within the country ??ended up bringing digital currencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum to the attention of many who had not heard of them before:?úIn my opinion, the 2017 ban led to no big change in people?ôs perception of cryptocurrency technologies.?ùIt is no surprise that China, as well as a host of smaller countries, were initially fearful of BTC and blockchain technology for their disruptive potential. However, since China was recently threatened with sanctions and tariffs, the local regime moved to realize that the U.S. dollar and the SWIFT monetary system were being used against it as weapons of war and attrition.¬†The crypto-friendly media reports are now showing that China is truly working toward its goal of widespread blockchain adoption at a rapid pace, and that the country is gearing up for some big changes in the coming few years following President Xi Jinping?ôs call for adoption.¬†To gain further insights on the matter, Cointelegraph asked Max Pertsovskiy, head of growth at Waves, to comment on whether or not he believes blockchain adoption will continue to increase throughout China in the coming few years.¬†On the subject, he noted that China?ôs plans have instigated a fire under all potential stakeholders around the globe, as the race for blockchain supremacy is now on:?úI believe that over the next decade, nothing will shape the texture of the global economy as the jostling for leverage between China and the United States will. While there are many benefits to central bank digital currencies, the obvious impetus for CBDC was the Libra. China wants to both increase the international reach of the RMB and prevent the spread of the Libra.?ùSimilarly, Ben Golub, CEO of cloud storage platform Storj Labs, is also of the belief that China?ôs apparent change of heart toward crypto-related technologies could be a sign for bigger things to come for the industry as a whole. Golub told Cointelegraph that China is likely to broaden the lead in blockchain relative to the U.S.:?úUntil the SEC rolls out more clear guidelines related to cryptocurrencies and blockchain," the US market will continue to stagnate."""""""

Draper believes that Bitcoin could reach $250,000 by 2022 or 2023, in part due to ?úBitcoin payment processors?? which ?úare really going to open the floodgates.??He said:?úIt?ôs because of Lightning Network and OpenNode and maybe others that are allowing us to spend Bitcoin very freely and quickly, so that it?ôs not just a store of value but it can be used for micropayments; it can be used for retail, it can be used all over.??,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, Statistica's Global Consumer Survey for 2019 shows that a fifth Turkish residents are acquainted with crypto and have been exposed to it in some form or another. If the figures are true, 20% is the highest proportion of all the countries in the world.¬†","Flying under the radar, Turkey has undoubtedly become a crypto giant, and with President Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan recently announcing that testing of the digital lira is to be finalized in 2020, crypto is destined to become even more popular.In fact, observing the rapid rise of crypto and blockchain in the country, Cointelgraph has unveiled the Turkish edition of the outlet this year. This article was written in association with their team ??and in particular, the editor, Erhan Kahraman.While the country?ôs government was initially reluctant to embrace cryptocurrencies, the people had always found utility in it. A survey from ING conducted in April 2015 found that 45% of Turkish people believed that digital currencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) were the future of online spending. This constituted the highest percentage for all the European countries surveyed, surpassing the European average of 28% by a wide margin.¬†This higher acceptance of crypto signals that Turkish people more readily use mobile devices for financial activities. The same survey showed that 56% of Turks had used mobile payment apps in contrast with the Eurpoean consumers??average of 33%.¬†The online payment sector in Turkey had been ready to adopt crypto, but the first opportunity only came when PayPal was banned in the country following the rejection of its license by the Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency. The use of crypto in the country spiked to unprecedented levels to fill the online payment space.¬†Barƒ±≈ü √ñzistek, the chairman of both venture capital fund Boƒüazi√ßi Ventures and games publication company Netmarble EMEA, attributed the high adoption of crypto to the advanced gaming market of the country, telling Cointelegraph, ?úThere are more than 30 million active gamers in Turkey. Gaming is a sphere in which virtual equipment and digital currency is used for the first time, and used most commonly.??He went on to add:¬†?úTurkish users already knew that virtual materials increase in value when supply and demand are created in the markets, or depending on their popularity, they may decrease in value. That's why Turkish users adopted to cryptocurrencies very fast and easily. Of course, a high percentage of digitally literate people among Turkish users and being informed about trade in our historical past were contributing factors to the situation.?ùBack in August 2014, Cointelegraph interviewed the founder of QuazarCoin, who goes by the name Orhan, about the state of crypto in Turkey. At the time, the regulatory environment in the country was not ideal, as the nation had banned Twitter amid rising political uncertainty.¬†In that interview, Orhan said Turkey was not the best place to develop crypto, not even Bitcoin itself, as the country did not have any frameworks nor the political stability set up to deal with the technology. He added that: ?úI think this is the reason why people connected to Bitcoin or alternative cryptocurrencies do not want to show their face or their true name to the general public.??These are some harsh criticisms for a country that would become a global leader in crypto adoption just five years after these words were said.¬†In 2017, the Turkish government made news with another major push back against crypto. The government claimed that Bitcoin was ?únot compatible??with Islam due to the speculative nature of buying and selling it. However, Ozistek recently told Cointelegraph that he thinks that blockchain and cryptos are pro-Islam, saying, ?úInstead of being haram, blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies are more in accord with Islamic Finance rules.??He went on to explain:?úWhen it comes to cryptocurrencies, if the project gains value, so does the cryptocurrency. You don't earn money from money. If the project you invested in gains value, the cryptocurrency you hold also gains value; if the project fails, your cryptocurrency loses value. It doesn't include a guaranteed income, such as interest.?ùTurkey?ôs political situation for the past decade has been rocky. The relationships with its highly distrurbed neighbors, Iraq and Syria, put the country at the heart of one of the most violent international conflicts in recent memory. Additionally, the country's relationship with global superpowers Russia and the United States hasn?ôt always been great either.All of these factors came together to make the Turkish lira one of the most volatile national currencies. Volatility wasn?ôt the only factor that led to the country?ôs migration toward cryptos. It was the uncertainty associated with the currency, too. ≈ûant Manukyan, the director of international markets at ƒ∞≈ü Yatƒ±rƒ±m, told Cointelegraph regarding the issue:?úWhen compared to other countries which include Argentina or countries with collapsed infrastructure such as Venezuela, the situation of Turkey is much more different, and better. Bitcoin is highlighted in these countries as a protection from devaluation and as a way to carry the money abroad. In Turkey, it provides an alternative to investors who use dollar but look for profit; but it's not as common as other countries for sure.?ùJuly 2016?ôs failed coup d?ô√©tat led to a sharp decline in the lira?ôs price. The lira sinking in August 2018 marked two years of economic uncertainty. Coupled with poor political relations with the U.S. and an impending debt crisis, high inflation and low interest rates, it was a perfect storm for an already tech-ready country to adopt crypto.The correlation of economically affected countries and high crypto adoption can be seen elsewhere across the global ??such as Venezuela, Iran and Zimbabwe ??giving credence to the theory of Hyperbitcoinization. Yasin Oral, the CEO and founder of Bitcoin exchange Paribu, told Cointelegraph:?úWhen a country go through an economic crisis it causes the investors to seek new channels and untroubled markets. In addition to this the fluctuating exchange rate gives way to new investment tools. In Turkey, the crypto money and the other digital assets were accepted as a new means of investment thanks to the population that can easily adapt to new technologies. If you pay attention to the local surveys, crypto money owners plan the digital assets as long term investments as well as actively making transactions.?ùTurkey?ôs Ministry of Industry and Technology announced plans to establish a national blockchain infrastructure during its Strategy 2023 presentation on Sept. 18 in Ankara. The plan necessitates working with Turkish regulators to assist in creating a regulatory sandbox for blockchain applications. This accompanied several blockchain technology implementations, like the Istanbul Blockchain and Innovation Center, known as BlockchainIST Center.¬†Talking about the country?ôs policymakers jumping on the crypto bandwagon early, Ozgur Guneri, the CEO of the BTCTurk exchange, told Cointelegraph that he believes Turkish policymakers are keen to see what blockchain and crypto can bring to the table, adding that:?úThe latest major policy decisions were Turkish Central Bank?ôs aim to launch a crypto currency and Financial Crimes Investigation Board?ôs decision to loosen its strict stand towards cryptocurrencies. I believe that major motivation behind Turkey?ôs interest in cryptocurrencies and blockchain is its revolutionary technology and all the potential disruption they may bring to the economy.?ùTurkey has a vision of making Istanbul a financial center, and all institutions are working toward that end. Talking about the hard path to make Turkey a global financial hub, √ñzistek said it will not be an easy task to take that status away from the United Kingdom and Switzerland:?úBy making necessary investments in cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, and creating infrastructure and legal regulations, Turkey may surpass its strong rivals just as a technology entrepreneur.

This indicates that the sentiment among the crypto companies remains bullish.Daily cryptocurrency market performance. Source: Coin360While the long-term outlook looks good, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has warned that only 1% of the cryptocurrencies in existence now will survive. However, the ones that survive are likely to grow significantly. Should traders buy the current dip in major cryptocurrencies or does today?ôs Bitcoin price pullback signal the start of a deeper correction? Let?ôs analyze the charts.¬†Bitcoin (BTC) has broken down of the 20-day EMA and can now slide to the 50-day SMA. The failure of the bulls to break out of the downtrend line is a negative sign. It shows a lack of demand at higher levels.If the bears sink the price below $8,467.54, which is a 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the most recent rally, a drop to the $7,702.87 to $7,297.21 support zone is likely. A break below this zone will be a huge negative.Conversely, if the BTC/USD pair bounces off the current levels, the bulls will again attempt to scale above the downtrend line. If successful, the pair is likely to pick up momentum. We will wait for a new buy setup to form before proposing a trade.Ether (ETH) turned down from the overhead resistance of $196.483 on Nov. 6 for the third time. This shows that bulls are defending $196.483 aggressively. If the price slips below $173.841, it can slide to $161.056.Both moving averages are flat and the RSI is close to 50, which suggests a balance between demand and supply.If the ETH/USD pair bounces off the $161.056-$151.829 support zone, it will remain range-bound for a few more days. The pair will pick up momentum above $196.483 while it will turn negative below $151.829. For now, traders can keep the stop loss on the long positions at $150.XRP turned down sharply from the overhead resistance of $0.31491 on Nov. 7. Though the bulls defended the support at the 50-day SMA, they could not sustain the rebound. This shows selling at higher levels.The 20-day EMA has started to turn down and the RSI has dipped into the negative zone. This suggests that bears have the upper hand.If the XRP/USD pair sustains below the 50-day SMA, it could drop to the critical support at $0.24508. A break below this support will be a huge negative. Hence, traders can keep the stop loss on the long position at $0.24.Contrary to our assumption, if the price rebounds off the 50-day EMA, the bulls will again attempt to break out of $0.31491. If successful, a rally to $0.34229 is likely.The bulls are struggling to sustain Bitcoin Cash (BCH) price above the neckline of the head and shoulders pattern. This shows that bears are defending the neckline. The pullback can reach the 20-day EMA, which is likely to offer support.If the price bounces off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will again attempt to push the price to $360. Nonetheless, if the bears sink the price below the 20-day EMA, the BCH/USD pair will turn negative. Hence, traders can trail the stop loss on long positions to breakeven.Litecoin (LTC) broke above $63.3876 on Nov. 5 but the bulls could not build upon the gains. This shows a lack of demand at higher levels. The price has pulled back to the 20-day EMA,¬† which is gradually sloping up. This suggests that the buyers have the upper hand in the short-term.If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will attempt to extend the recovery and carry the LTC/USD pair to $80.2731. Contrary to our assumption, if the pair dips below the moving averages, it will remain range-bound for a few days. For now, the stop loss on the long positions can be kept at $47. We might suggest closing the position if the price sustains below the moving averages.EOS broke out of the overhead resistance at $3.58 on Nov. 5, which triggered our buy recommendation given in the earlier analysis. However, contrary to our assumption, the bulls could not sustain the momentum and carry the price higher. Profit booking has dragged the price back towards the critical support a $3.37. The 20-day EMA is sloping up and is placed just below $3.37. This indicates that the bulls have the upper hand.If the price bounces off the 20-day EMA, the buyers will attempt to push the price to $4.8719. Our bullish view will be invalidated if the bears sink the price below the 50-day SMA. Therefore, traders can keep the stop loss on the long positions at $2.95.The bulls have not been able to propel Binance Coin (BNB) above $21.2378 for the past few days. This shows that buying dries up at higher levels. If the bulls fail to defend the 20-day EMA, a drop to $18.3 is possible.If the price rebounds off $18.30, the BNB/USD pair could remain range-bound for a few days. The pair will pick up momentum on a breakout and close above $21.2378.However, if the bulls fail to defend $18.30, a drop to $16.50 will be on the cards. If the price re-enters the channel, it will be a huge negative. Hence, traders can continue to retain the stop loss on long positions at $16.Bitcoin SV (BSV) broke out and closed (UTC time) above the downtrend line on Nov. 5, which triggered our buy recommended in the previous analysis. However, contrary to our assumption, the price could not reach $155.38.The altcoin turned down from $143.04. This is a bearish sign as it suggests a lack of buyers at higher levels. The BSV/USD pair has slipped below the most recent low of $124.50, which triggered our stop loss proposed in the previous analysis.If the price bounces off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will again attempt to reach $155.38. However, if bears sustain the price below the 20-day EMA, a deeper correction is likely.¬†Stellar (XLM) rallied close to our first target objective of $0.088708 on Nov. 5 where traders could have booked partial profits on the long positions as suggested in our previous analysis. Profit booking at the resistance has dragged the price to the 20-day EMA, which should have triggered the trailing stop loss.Both moving averages are flattening out and the RSI has dipped to the midpoint. This suggests a range formation in the near term.Our neutral view will be invalidated if the XLM/USD pair rebounds sharply and rises above the overhead resistance of $0.088708. However, we give it a low probability of occurring. Alternatively, if the price slips below the 20-day EMA, a dip to the 50-day SMA is likely. We will wait for a new buy setup to form before recommending a trade in it.Tron (TRX) has been range-bound between $0.01866 and $0.020488 for the past few days. Attempts to breakout or breakdown of this range have failed. This shows a balance between both buyers and sellers. The flat moving averages and the RSI just above the midpoint also suggests a few days of consolidation.¬†The balance will shift in favor of bulls if the TRX/USD pair breaks out and closes above $0.020488. Above this, a move to $0.0234 and above it to $0.030 is likely. On the other hand, if the pair breaks below $0.01866, bears will be at an advantage. The next support on the downside is at the 50-day SMA and below it $0.0136655.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

been challenging investors and their holding powers. Despite BTC ...",23-Nov-19,"What?ôs an effective way to diversify a crypto portfolio? Are crypto assets able to be diversified at all? These are the questions that many ?úHodlers??have been asking. The slow bleed of Bitcoin (BTC) and other major cryptocurrencies prices has been challenging investors and their holding powers. Despite BTC still able to maintain its 112% year-to-date gains so far ??thanks to the massive bull run in the second quarter and the recent China-inspired rally ??the recent price correction could pressure some of the latecomers. In this article, we will study some possible diversification options for crypto portfolios from a Hodler?ôs perspective ??i.e., diversifying investment by allocating capital into various crypto assets using long-only strategies. We will also explore how altcoins and stablecoins could balance a portfolio.","In the traditional world of finance, the performance of different assets could vary under different market conditions. For example, real estate investment trusts could outperform general equities in a turbulence market, and defensive stocks could disappoint investors when the appetite for risk is heightened. That?ôs when diversification comes in. The main purpose of exposure to different asset classes is to balance risk and return in a portfolio.In the cryptocurrency space, diversification could also be one of the ways to manage risk exposure. However, some would argue that it is impossible to diversify a crypto portfolio due to the fact that major altcoins are highly correlated with Bitcoin. However, with a carefully selected basket of altcoins ??in conjunction with stablecoins ??investors could able to navigate the market more effectively with manageable risk.There has always been a debate about putting all your eggs in one basket. While in some cases concentrating on only one asset could maximize profitability, this also maximizes the risk exposure. On top of that, a heavy-concentration strategy gives investors no room for any errors in analysis, and it overexposes the investor to unnecessary risks.However, over-diversification could also hurt investment returns. Some investors believe that the more assets they own, the better return they can have ??and that?ôs not the right concept. It could increase investment cost, add unnecessary due-diligence efforts and lead to below-average risk-adjusted returns.Before getting into portfolio diversification, let?ôs have a quick recap on the performance of major cryptocurrencies. The figure below shows that OKB and BTC were among some of the YTD gainers, while XMR and XRP have been underperforming compared to their peers. Once again, this shows various crypto assets could perform very differently, highlighting the importance of balancing risk and return.A portfolio with a balanced selection of coins and tokens could help Hodlers balance risk and returns. Here are some sample portfolios using BTC alongside other leading altcoins as well as the Fundstrat Crypto 40 Index ??a weighted index tracks the top 11 to 50 cryptocurrencies by market value and liquidity. The results could make Hodlers think again about putting all their eggs in one basket.Many BTC-based portfolios have remained solidly in the green, due in part to Bitcoin holding on to its 112% gain so far this year. As shown above, however, the portfolio containing only BTC and Ether (ETH) has been underperformed compared to portfolios that have both BTC and exposure to mid-cap altcoins. To see this, compare the 50/50 portfolio (with a yearly gain of 67%) to the one consisting of Bitcoin and the top-40 index (gaining 77% on the year).Meanwhile, the hedging nature of stablecoins like Tether (USDT) has been reflected in the sample portfolio based on BTC and the index with a hedge (76%). In this diversification example, the exposure to altcoins is reduced, the BTC holdings are slightly increased and USDT was added. Still, the gain of this portfolio was very close to the one without USDT. In general, a portfolio that includes stablecoins can reduce the risk ratio more than one that is unhedged, but as the examples above show, it is still possible to achieve similar results.Stablecoins are especially important in portfolios that include highly volatile coins and tokens, as can be seen in the example of the hedged basket. The group comprises XLM and OKB, which have plummeted over 46% and surged over 290% respectively. Still, this combination was able to achieve almost 80% YTD gains, and the USDT holdings were part of the reason behind that performance. In contrast, the mixture of BTC and certain altcoins without a stablecoin in the basket could underperform the other sample portfolios provided.Additionally, experienced traders and Hodlers are able to fine-tune their portfolios by adding derivatives on top of a long-only portfolio. For example, if a Hodler is being short-term bullish on an individual coin, he can increase his leverage on that specific coin by adding futures or perpetual swap positions on top of the holdings. Structured products can also be used as a hedge in a downturning market.Related: How to Trade Big Crypto Volumes, ExplainedCrypto asset diversification has been one of the most debated topics in the industry. Some would argue that a 100% Bitcoin allocation setup could probably still able to generate a decent return this year. However, a BTC-only portfolio will never able to capture the distinctive opportunities in the altcoin world, which could potentially generate higher returns ??and, of course, putting all your eggs in one basket comes with higher risk. A carefully designed portfolio with balanced asset allocation could maximize the risk-adjusted return. As the year-end approaches, investors and Hodlers can review their risk profiles and adjust their strategies for next year.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author?ôs alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

In his interview with CNBC, Sonnenshein noted the robust institutional interest in cryptocurrency access products. Even just in Q3 2019, he said:??4% of inflows were from non-crypto hedge funds that want digital asset exposure.?ùGBTC has been trading since May 2015 and Sonnenshein noted that ?úif we just look at the last 3-month trading volume, it?ôs tripled year-over-year,??regardless of Bitcoin?ôs performance on the spot markets.Regarding the significance of the SEC potentially giving the green light to Grayscale?ôs Form 10 filing, Sonnenshein said:?úYou have a lot of companies that want to have exposure to the space, but then you start to ask, who at the company is going to have the keys? Who at the company is going to do the due diligence and the ongoing compliance??ùAside from compliance benefits, he emphasized the importance of creating a family of products that ?úlook and feel like many of the other instruments these institutions use.?ùThe takeaway, he suggested, is that if Form 10 is deemed to be effective, we?ôll see for the first time ?úgreater access for institutions who need an SEC reporting company to be able to invest??and ?úquicker liquidity options, so that investors can divulge their holdings after six, as opposed to twelve, months.?ùRegarding any potential impact on Bitcoin?ôs price, Sonnenshein discarded the institutional investor adoption narrative and emphasized instead Bitcoin?ôs forthcoming halving ??and consequent diminishment of supply ??as a factor that has historically shown itself to have a positive impact on the asset?ôs price.As reported, Grayscale?ôs regulatory foray follows a record year for the trust, which saw inflows of $254 million in total investment into its products in the third quarter of 2019.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

86,https://cointelegraph.com,18-Nov-19,How Crypto and Blockchain Are Influencing Geopolitics,https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-crypto-and-blockchain-are-influencing-geopolitics,"With the U.S. and China at ends, India clamping down on Bitcoin, and the 
U.K. pursuing Brexit, how will the crypto market influence geopolitics?",18-Nov-19,,"The world is a constantly changing place ??and from an economic standpoint, things are dramatically shifting, too. Two major superpowers, the United States and China, are embroiled in a dramatic trade war where tit-for-tat tariffs have been placed on goods ??breeding uncertainty for consumers and businesses alike and making everyday products more expensive. The United Kingdom is still embroiled in a messy divorce from the European Union, and Russia is ratcheting up tensions with its neighbors in the West.All of this geopolitical drama has two effects. Firstly, it can wreak havoc on the markets, wiping billions of dollars off the value of major companies and affecting employment rates in the world?ôs economies. Secondly, it is prompting some enthusiasts to passionately advocate for crypto and blockchain taking a bigger role in the economy. They say it could help bring down borders, making international payments faster and less expensive, while encouraging trade between nations.That said, crypto and blockchain are also creating new geopolitical challenges. North Korea has faced allegations that a sophisticated group of hackers are launching cyberattacks on major exchanges in neighboring South Korea and other parts of Asia. Millions of dollars have been lost, with each incident shaking consumer confidence to its core. India has also been resolute in its decision to push ahead with a crypto ban. This could have ramifications for the likes of Facebook, which is hoping to launch a stablecoin that would benefit the unbanked. The Libra project is also creating tensions around the world, with many countries ??the U.S. and the EU among them ??concerned that the cryptocurrency could undermine traditional payment infrastructure and overtake the dollar and the euro.A major thing that?ôs holding cryptocurrency back is the disjointed, fragmented approach to regulation around the world. While some countries like India are taking a hardline approach by proposing jail terms for anyone found handling these coins and tokens, the likes of Japan and Canada have been far more laidback ??encouraging innovation, enabling taxes to be paid using Bitcoin, and creating so-called ?úregulatory sandboxes??where new crypto products can be tested on a small portion of the population before being rolled out.There is a real and pressing divide when it comes to the attitudes surrounding crypto and blockchain. In some countries, there is incredible caution surrounding this technology amid fears it could have a detrimental impact on vulnerable consumers. That said, there are politicians out there who are appalled by the negative attitude that?ôs being espoused towards the industry ??people who believe in its potential and believe their country should be at the forefront of innovation.In part, this desire for a pro-crypto stance lies in fears that certain countries may be getting a headstart on developing their own central bank digital currency, establishing early dominance. One such country is China ??which is already set to embark on a rapid acceleration of blockchain usage at the behest of President Xi Jinping.Reading the tea leaves to figure out what the future holds for crypto and blockchain is a challenge. Will China achieve dominance and launch a central bank digital currency? Will India be successful in its quest to ban cryptocurrency? Will Russia succeed in its quest to enable law enforcement to confiscate Bitcoin, and is this even possible?With so many unknowns, conferences have gained popularity as a way of hearing valuable insights from some of the best-known practitioners in the crypto and blockchain industries. One of them is the¬†Crypto Finance Conference, which is taking place from Jan. 15 to 17 in St. Moritz, Switzerland.Organizers of the conference say that they are determined to cater each session to the individual needs of attendees. To that end, some of the event?ôs main speakers are going to be taking time to answer questions both onstage and offstage. Extensive networking opportunities are also on offer, giving delegates the chance to delve into areas of particular interest and establish meaningful contacts.The program is still under development ??but already, there are a series of sessions that will interest those who are keeping a close eye on geopolitical developments in the industry. The first day will explore the global impact of crypto and blockchain, and offer predictions for the future. There?ôs little doubt that the talk on the evolution of central banking will explore the attitudes that countries worldwide are adopting when it comes to everything from Bitcoin to Libra. Tales from the global regulatory frontline are also going to be shared.With crypto and blockchain constantly hitting the headlines and battles being fought on many fronts, there?ôs going to be plenty to discuss as business visionaries descend on one of Switzerland?ôs finest resort towns.Disclaimer.

But as the United Kingdom delves further into an uncertain period of political instability that could radically alter the very identity of the country, its attractiveness for business is starting to be questioned.","Despite the need to appear as business-friendly and open to innovation as possible due to the ramifications of the ongoing Brexit crisis, the U.K. still lacks a concrete framework for the regulation of cryptocurrency.¬†However, in mid-November, the United Kingdom Jurisdiction Taskforce of the LawTech Delivery Panel published a statement exploring the legal status of cryptocurrencies, blockchain and smart contracts under English and Welsh private law.¬†The Brexit crisis has tarnished the reputation of the U.K. ??a country that was once famed for its strong economy and pro-business approach has come to be known for division and stagnation. For three years, the country has remained in stasis as other, more forward-thinking nations fill the void left behind.¬†Despite many prominent crypto-related companies basing themselves in the U.K., the country yet lacks any concrete crypto regulation compared to some of its Asian and European counterparts.Taking a step out of the still waters, the Tech Nation and LawTech Delivery panel report seeks to lay the foundation for a robust regulatory framework for blockchain, cryptocurrency and smart contracts. Most notably, the legal statement outlines crypto assets as tradeable property and smart contracts as enforceable agreements under local law.¬†Although the publication of the report is an indicator that progress is being made behind the scenes in the U.K. regarding crypto regulation, it does not represent direct action or explicit support from the government itself. Nevertheless, the LawTech Delivery Panel members include industry experts and U.K. government figures, as well as members from the judiciary space ??all seeking to develop the burgeoning crypto sector within the country.The report begins with a bold statement from the chancellor to the High Court and chair of the U.K. Jurisdiction Taskforce, Geoffrey Vos, about the potential of cryptocurrencies and smart contracts:¬†?úIn legal terms, cryptoassets and smart contracts undoubtedly represent the future. I hope that the Legal Statement will go a long way towards providing much needed market confidence, legal certainty and predictability in areas that are of great importance to the technological and legal communities and to the global financial services industry.?ùVos speculated that the report, while not setting out the specific details for crypto regulation itself, would play an important role in future attempts to do so, and ?úprovide a foundation for the responsible future utilisation of cryptoassets and smart contracts.?ùA spokesperson for CryptoUK, the U.K.?ôs self-regulatory trade association representing the crypto asset sector, gave a statement to Cointelegraph regarding the LawTech Delivery Panel?ôs publication:¬†?úThe LawTech Delivery Panel?ôs legal statement on cryptoassets is welcome because it brings a degree of greater clarity to the legal standing of cryptoassets in English law.?ùThe report also celebrates the potential for blockchain and smart contracts. As observed by LawTech Delivery Panel director Jennifer Swallow, the global smart contract market is expected to reach $300 million by 2023.¬†The same publication states that the World Economic Forum predicts one-tenth of global GDP will be stored on blockchains by 2027. Consequently, Swallow outlined her belief that regulating these technologies is vitally important, ?úIt is great to see the adaptability of our common law system to fast-changing technology, demonstrated in this landmark legal statement from the UKJT.?ùWhile any statements on the regulation of cryptocurrency are welcome, readers of the report will note that the taskforce has been clear that it is not recommending a comprehensive account of all legal details regarding the technology: ?úIts purpose is to answer the questions we were asked and to state briefly our reasons in a form accessible to non-lawyers as well as lawyers.?ùInvestors seeking a definitive step toward cryptocurrency?ôs ultimate goal of replacing mainstream finance will be disappointed by the absence of discussion about cryptocurrency as money:¬†?úThe Taskforce considers that matters of taxation, criminal law, partnership law, data protection, intellectual property, consumer protection, settlement finality, regulatory capital, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing are best dealt with by other bodies or organisations. We have not trespassed into issues relating to monetary policy or the nature of cryptoassets as money?ùAs might be expected in the cut-throat business environment of the U.K., information that could give businesses the edge they need to succeed are awaited with bated breath. While the report is unlikely to create waves in the U.K. crypto world on its own, several figures from the industry spoke to Cointelegraph about what prospects it could have for further development.¬†Related: UK Crypto Regulation Is Changing, Recognition Looming at Long LastPiers Ridyard, CEO of the Radix decentralized ledger, told Cointelegraph that U.K. authorities are actually relatively open to crypto innovation and that their cooperation with the writers of this report should be noted:¬†?úThe FCA has been progressive on its views on crypto for years; including monitoring and permitting trials of the technology in sandbox environments before regulatory licenses are needed. The UK generally sees itself as a Fintech leader, and the FCA sees part of its job as not getting in the way of innovation. This report was written with direct input from members of the FCA, and is overall a good indication of the direction the UK wants to head.?ùHowever, the regulatory compliance team of London-based cryptocurrency exchange CEX.IO explained in a private correspondence with Cointelegraph that as the report is published by an independent, non-governmental body, the impact is not likely to be immediate, but it could play an important role in regulatory decisions made further down the line:?úWe can speak only about indirect influence, since the Lawtech Delivery Panel is a consultative rather than a regulatory or legislative body. However, it has significant influence deriving from industry and government support. Given this influence, the considerations and conclusions of the panel may be used by lawmakers, regulators, and courts as the baseline and grounded rationale for further decisions.?ùSukhi Jutla, co-founder of blockchain-based gold and jewelry platform Market Orders, told Cointelegraph that what the report lacks in immediate ability to bring about legal change, it makes up for in demonstrating the interest that relevant authorities are paying to cryptocurrency, adding:¬†?úThis should hopefully encourage more conversations to be had around how these assets should be governed and regulated in a way that fosters innovation and development in the blockchain and crypto community.?ùThe U.K.?ôs legal system is one of the most reputable in the world. Combined with the country?ôs long and well-established financial history, this makes it a strong candidate when choosing a country in which to set up a business.¬†For some crypto entrepreneurs, U.K. law is also better suited for the regulation of crypto than the legal systems of other countries, as stated in the LawTech Delivery Panel report. The compliance team of CEX.IO told Cointelegraph that the U.K. common law system is more adaptable than its European counterparts, ?úCompared to continental law, sometimes you do not need to go through the time-consuming and complicated legislative process, but rather can rely on the determination of the court.?ùRadix CEO Piers Ridyard told Cointelegraph that the U.K.?ôs legal system has a competitive edge when it comes to fintech, citing its flexibility for innovation in the market:?úIts case law based approach to rule enforcement in court is also very flexible for quickly adapting to new changes in market when the letter of the law can be sometimes unclear.?ùHaving founded a blockchain-based business in the UK, Market Orders??Sukhi Jutla explained to Cointelegraph that while the U.K. is a good place for fintech companies to launch, more work needs to be done in order to iron out the legal gray areas:¬†?úFor the UK to emerge as the best place to create a crypto-related company, business owners need greater clarity and support from the government and financial bodies to feel assured that their innovations won?ôt get them penalised or fined.?ùAlthough some more radical crypto enthusiasts are itching to see the mainstream financial superstructure crumble and fall, many involved in crypto-related business in the U.K. want to see it develop into a system capable of more forward-looking practices.¬†Despite the sluggish government action on cryptocurrency, several crypto businesses told Cointelegraph that along with the legal statement?ôs publishing, they see positive developments occurring in the U.K. According to the CEX.IO team, London still wears the financial crown, and cryptocurrency adoption will pave the way for the city to keep its prestigious status:¬†?úFirst of all, the UK was, is, and will be the leading financial center of the world. We believe that crypto assets and underlying technology bring dramatic changes to the architecture of the financial world, and the UK, whether we are talking about the City of London, Canary Wharf, or elsewhere, is in the best position to keep their high status, providing an attractive environment and creating a fertile ecosystem for future development.?ùRadix?ôs Ridyard told Cointelegraph that while the U.K. enjoys a strong reputation based on its history of being pro-business, it is slipping down the rankings and Brexit brings with it further uncertainty:?úThe UK ranks number 8 on the world?ôs ranking of ease of doing business, and has one of the most mature financial regulatory frameworks in the world. With the advent of Brexit, it is likely to continue to fight hard for making itself as attractive as possible as a jurisdiction crypto related companies as this is the future of finance.?ùWhile the statement might not be the groundbreaking legal framework many are eagerly anticipating, it is nonetheless a demonstration that progress is being made in terms of cryptocurrency regulation.¬†The U.K. legal framework is thorough and change can, and often does, take time. A CryptoUK spokesperson told Cointelegraph that while the legal statement is a positive development, it is not a substitute for comprehensive legal action:¬†?úThat?ôs why we?ôre calling for the regulation of cryptoassets in the UK, to provide greater certainty and adequately protect consumers. We are actively working alongside regulators and the Government to help deliver a proportionate and well-designed UK regulatory regime which matches the best of other jurisdictions across the world.?ùSimilarly, CEX.IO?ôs compliance team believes that there is great appetite for crypto regulation in the U.K., despite there having been a number of rules already put in place: ?úThe specific crypto-focused legislation should also clarify relations with financial institutions, that will stimulate the markets growth.??However, the exchange believes that there is still a long way to go before the regulatory environment in the U.K. can be considered up to scratch:¬†?úThe Cryptoassets Taskforce ??consisting of the HM Treasury, the Bank of England, and the FCA ??did a great job back in 2018, and it was later incremented by the FCA when they issued their Policy Statement on Cryptoassets in July this year. But there is much more work to be done, and this statement is a significant contribution.??

Venezuela-based cryptocurrency consultant and Cointelegraph en Espa√±ol ...",13-Nov-19,"Last week, the president of Venezuela, Nicol√°s Maduro, appeared on national television approaching a Trezor-branded stall at a local technological fair. He seemed perplexed as to what exactly a hardware cryptocurrency wallet is supposed to do.","Still, Maduro, device in hand, turned to the camera and proclaimed that cryptocurrencies ??his country?ôs own digital currency, Petro, in particular ??are important for Venezuela?ôs economic future. Trezor officials soon clarified that they had nothing to do with the stunt, and that the company had no official resellers in the country.The event seemed to accurately portray the precarious situation of cryptocurrencies in Venezuela. They are widely popular, given the hyperinflation and overall failing state of the local economy, but are mostly traded underground via peer-to-peer services.¬†Meanwhile, Maduro?ôs government is mostly focused on Petro ??the controversial, state-controlled cryptocurrency tasked with saving the Venezuelan economy. So, what has Maduro?ôs apparent obsession with cryptocurrencies resulted in so far besides an underdeveloped pet project?¬†Maduro was elected president in April 2013, following Hugo Ch√°vez?ôs death, in a narrow win over opposition candidate Henrique Capriles. Maduro?ôs administration instantly faced a number of major economic problems left over from Ch√°vez?ôs policies, namely high inflation rates and large shortages of basic necessities.¬†The new president continued the policial course of his predecessor, who largely relied on oil-fueled welfare policies to maintain economic stability. However, the price of oil ??which reportedly account for 99% of Venezuela?ôs export earnings ??started to tumble under Maduro?ôs administration, bringing the country to the verge of a major humanitarian catastrophe.¬†Thus, the inflation rate has been on the rise ever since Maduro was elected president. In 2018, it was at 1,698,488%. According to the International Monetary Fund, Venezuela?ôs hyperinflation rate increased to as much as 10,000,000% at some point this year.Needless to say, these numbers have real implications: In 2017, 87% of people in Venezuela were living in poverty, rising from 82% in 2016 and 48% in 2014, according to an academic study. Hunger is also a major problem, with Venezuelans losing about 24 lbs on average in 2017 due to nationwide food shortages.The president has blamed capitalism for the ongoing problems. For instance, Maduro argued that an imperialist ?úelectromagnetic attack??caused the largest power outage in the country?ôs history, which occurred in March 2019. According to opposition leader Juan Guaid√≥, it was actually ?úthe product of the inefficiency, the incapability, the corruption of a regime that doesn?ôt care about the lives of Venezuelans.?ùRelated: Venezuelan Petro Against US Sanctions: History and Use of the CryptoIn December 2017, Maduro took to national TV to present a potential fix for the many economic difficulties ??a state-run digital currency called Petro. The cryptocurrency would be backed by the country?ôs oil, gold and mineral reserves, the president said.¬†Ironically, Maduro?ôs administration had been anti-crypto up until that point. Earlier in 2017, reports emerged that the government had begun cracking down on mining operations. Indeed, cryptocurrency mining was and still remains a popular activity in Venezuela, as it allows locals to capitalize on cheap electricity prices.?úIn Venezuela, the most popular currency is Bitcoin,??according to Venezuela-based cryptocurrency consultant and Cointelegraph en Espa√±ol contributor Jhonnatan Morales, who added that, ?úMany people are mining and trading Bitcoin not to acquire products, but to protect themselves from hyperinflation.?ùMaduro?ôs Petro was designed to dodge United States sanctions that supposedly hinder the local economy. As the Venezuelian leader himself put it, the cryptocurrency aims to fight the financial ?úblockade??erected by the U.S. President Donald Trump?ôs administration. In response, Trump restricted American investors from participating in the initial coin offering for Petro, which launched on Feb. 20, 2018. Morales told Cointelegraph:?úAlthough the government has the help of Russia for many of its international operations, the use of cryptocurrency to liquidate or transfer capital is important for the government since cash is usually impractical for international contracts.?ùIn March 2018, a month into the ICO, Maduro claimed that a total of $5 billion was raised during Petro?ôs presale ??which would make it one of the largest ICOs to date, eclipsing the $2 billion TON token private offering led by Telegram and the $4.2 billion token sale of EOS.¬†However, as Steve Hanke, an applied economist at Johns Hopkins University, has pointed out, those claims ?úaren?ôt believable??because they have yet to be verified by an independent audit.Petro was officially launched in November 2018, following a series of delays. The release was not problem-free, either. Soon after the white paper was published, crypto enthusiasts found out that Petro largely plagiarized its documentation from Dash (DASH), one of the most popular cryptocurrencies in the country.¬†As Jorge Farias, CEO of Cryptobuyer ??a Panama-headquartered exchange platform run by a team of Venezuleans ??told Cointelegraph, Petro is technically a Dash fork, albeit a permissioned one:¬†?úPetro has gone through different stages, from a totally failed one, to one where there is a blockchain that although it is private and not auditable at least it has a block explorer. It is an X11 fork that is the same one used by DASH.?ùMaduro seems determined to integrate Petro into the local economy, even though its utility seems questionable. For instance, he has announced the launch of a Petro-funded crypto bank to support youth and student initiatives, and Venezuelan Minister of Habitat and Housing Ildemaro Villarroel declared that Petro will be used to fund the construction of houses for the homeless. Maduro has also publicly called on workers to save in gold and Petro during a salary shake-up.In December 2018, the government went as far as to automatically convert pensioners??monthly bonus into Petro, despite the fact that the cryptocurrency was not widely accepted in the country, according to reports. Around the same time, Maduro claimed that his government will use Petro to sell oil and hence minimize U.S. dominance on the global market.¬†Country-wide adoption could be nearing for Petro at last, although under compulsion. In August this year, Maduro ordered the country?ôs leading bank, Banco de Venezuela, to accept the nation?ôs cryptocurrency at all of its branches. In September, when the bank provided its clients with online wallets catering to Petro, the people of Venezuela set a new record for trading cryptocurrencies ??only they weren?ôt trading Petro.¬†From Sept. 1 to Sept. 7, Venezuelans traded more than 120 billion bolivars (roughly around $4 million) for Bitcoin on P2P exchange LocalBitcoins, showing that demand for decentralized cryptocurrencies has not diminished with the state-run asset?ôs arrival. A representative for the charity-focused organization Bitcoin Venezuela told Cointelegraph that indeed, most cryptocurrency trading is done via P2P services:?úBitcoin is popular as it used to be used as a way to send remittances from outside the country through LocalBitcoins, Hodl Hodl, Paxful, because it is very liquid and there are thousands of people willing to buy your BTC right away for Bolivars (VES) in a bank account, the local currency, or Dollars in a US bank or USD cash.?ùThe spokesperson also confirmed that there are no large exchanges based in the country, only a ?úBTC/VES brokerage service??and seven exchanges that have been approved by officials to operate in the country.¬†These platforms seem to be mostly focused on Petro, as they have BTC/PTR and PTR/VES trading pairs listed on their websites. Cointelegraph reached out to most of the approved exchanges ??Cryptolago, Coincave, Bancar, Ambers Coin and Cryptia ??but none have replied.¬†Nevertheless, Petro might still become widely accepted in Venezuela at some point in the future. According to Farias of Cryptobuyer, ?úThey talk about more than 900 businesses already accepting it as a form of payment and the obligation to keep double accounting for private and public companies.??This may suggest that the bolivar may soon be eliminated and thus set a precedent for the rest of the world. Farias added:¬†?úMany businessmen and companies have shown some interest as long as it can be converted into some other crypto or FIAT, but it is necessary to wait for the mechanisms and regulations that will govern these processes to draw some conclusion.?ùIt seems that Maduro has appropriated cryptocurrencies for his own means ??and Petro allows the Venezuelian leader to weed decentralized cryptocurrencies out from that agenda. Indeed, the state needs a currency that it can control. Morales told Cointelegraph:?úAlmost 30% of all retail operations in Venezuela are made through the dollar. This does not allow the Venezuelan government to collect taxes since they have no way to access the account in dollars where Venezuelans deposit their taxes.?ùAccording to Javier Bastardo, a local cryptocurrency enthusiast and Cointelegraph en Espa√±ol journalist, Maduro?ôs knowledge of the technology behind cryptocurrencies seems limited, although that doesn?ôt stop him from aggressively promoting Petro:?úHe talks about the ?òtechnological revolution,???ònew relations,??but this is just rhetoric. Obviously he only shills his own project and tends to not mention Bitcoin.?ùIn August, Trump?ôs administration froze all Venezuelan government assets, further escalating the tense U.S.?ìVenezuelan relations and prompting Maduro to work on alternative financial options like Petro. Perhaps that ??along with other developments like the study suggesting that Venezuela is now more than 50% dollarized ??was what caused Maduro to attend the technological fair last week.¬†As Farias explained to Cointelegraph, the fair was a private event launched by Banco de Venezuela, where various companies showcased solutions ?úbased in one way or another on cryptocurrencies.?ùOne of the attending firms was Trezorvenezuela, a local company that is not directly affiliated with Trezor but sells its products locally. Maduro approached the company?ôs stall on live television, which resulted in the president of Venezuela de facto endorsing a cryptocurrency wallet developed by a nonlocal company without its consent.¬†?úTrezor and Satoshilabs do not have any official representatives in Venezuela, nor do we have any active authorized resellers in this region,??the official statement that soon followed from the hardware wallet firm read. It continued:?úWe?ôre in no way associated with those people claiming to be official representatives of Trezor, and do not endorse or permit their use of our brand. We are carefully investigating this copyright infringement.?ùThe statement then added that the individuals were at one time Trezor resellers from the third quarter of 2018 but were removed from the list in June 2019 due to inactivity. In an additional comment to Cointelegraph, the Trezor representative added that they are ?úin contact with Trezorvenezuela and are continuing our investigations to decide what steps to take next.?ùA spokesperson for Trezorvenezuela, in turn, explained to Cointelegraph that they ?úsaw nothing wrong with participating,??elaborating:?úOur company was at the event, as in the others, as it supports the cryptocurrency ecosystem in general, without politicizing them, our vision and commitment is with the ecosystem and demonstrate that cryptocurrencies are real solutions to multiple problems. Even for the people of Venezuela, which gives them freedom to manage their funds and protect themselves from the hyperinflation that our country is home to.?ù¬†The Trezorvenezuela representative added that Maduro?ôs team did not contact them after the fair.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

According to the New York-based blockchain analytics firm, there are still some crypto exchanges including Bitforex that likely report fake trading volumes to simulate greater market activity and liquidity. Chainalysis posted the study on its blog on Nov. 15.","In the study, Chainalysis analyzed the top 10 cryptocurrency exchanges, known as the ?úBitwise 10,??which were reportedly considered the only large exchanges that reported their actual volumes. Those exchanges include Binance, Bitfinex, Kraken, Bitstamp, Coinbase, BitFlyer, Gemini, itBit, Bittrex, and Poloniex.The firm used the Bitwise 10 as a representative sample of large exchanges who report accurate trade volumes, and compared their data with volumes of other exchanges in order to discover potential suspicious activity. Specifically, Chainalysis found out that in a period between January 2018 and November 2019, the average ratio between trade volume and on-chain volume received for the Bitwise 10 accounted for 6:1. The data means that the Bitwise 10 see roughly six Bitcoin in trade volume for every one Bitcoin received on-chain.Chainalysis further analyzed 25 other exchanges with large on-chain volumes out of the Bitwise 10 list. The firm eventually identified 12 more exchanges whose trade volume to on-chain volume ratios significantly differed from the Bitwise 10 in 2018, but have since declined more in line with the exemplary data. The 12 exchanges list included Huobi, OKCoin, UPbit, Bithumb, Bit2c, Bitbank, Bitso, CoinCheck, Coinfloor, CoinOne, Korbit, and Zaif.Based on the data, Chainalysis concluded that it?ôs likely that those 12 exchanges were faking trade volume in 2018, specifically during the period between July and January 2019. Since 2019, the exchanges' trade volume ratios have tracked more closely with those of the Bitwise 10, suggesting that they have stopped misreporting volumes.Ratio of Bitcoin traded per Bitcoin reviewed on-chain.

According to Chainalysis, reported a trade volume ratio of 40,000:1 in a period from January 2019 to November 2019. That means that Bitforex reported 40,000 bitcoin worth of trade volume for every 1 bitcoin that enters the exchange, compared to just 6 for the Bitwise 10.Bitforex is ranked the 34th-largest exchange by trade volumes at the time of writing, according to Coin360.Chainalysis??new study follows a report by crypto index fund provider Bitwise Asset Management claiming that as much as 95% of volume on unregulated exchanges appears to be fake or non-economic in nature.On Nov. 12, major crypto data supplier CoinMarketCap launched its new metric to compare exchanges and token pairs based on liquidity as a measure to prevent manipulation by exchanges.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

96,https://cointelegraph.com,Nov 23"," 2019""",Grayscale Puts Trust to the Test by Pursuing SEC Registration,https://cointelegraph.com/news/grayscale-puts-trust-to-the-test-by-pursuing-sec-registration,"Grayscale Bitcoin Trust may become the first SEC-reporting crypto-based 
security, potentially signifying a trend for more transparency.",23-Nov-19,"On Nov. 19, Grayscale Investments, a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group and the world's largest digital asset manager, filed a voluntary registration statement on Form 10 with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on behalf of its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust.","If successful, the move would result in the trust acquiring the status of an SEC reporting company, the first cryptocurrency investment instrument to do so. The trust?ôs shares would therefore be registered according to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.Grayscale Investments expects the development to broaden the product?ôs investor base and provide those already holding the trust?ôs shares better transparency and liquidity. However, the digital asset management company also emphasized that it is seeking neither an exchange-traded fund status nor listing on a national securities exchange.So, what would the regulator?ôs approval of the form mean for Grayscale Bitcoin Trust and the wider crypto industry?An investment trust is a company that owns a fixed amount of a certain asset and issues contracts representing shares of its ownership. Investors who own the shares also pay fees to the company that manages the trust. Each share of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust currently represents a little less than 0.001 BTC, with an annual fee of 2%. The share of ownership by a contract slowly decreases over time. Overall, the trust holds some 175,000 Bitcoins.Launched in September 2013 and trading since May 2015, Grayscale markets GBTC as a ?útraditional investment vehicle??whose structure is familiar to financial and tax advisors. Although the firm consistently emphasizes that the product is not an exchange-traded fund, GBTC is modelled similarly to many popular commodity-based ETFs. The shares are eligible to be traded through brokerages and can be held in tax-advantaged accounts, such as individual retirement accounts or 401(k)s.Related: The SEC Does Not Want Crypto ETFs ??What Will It Take to Get Approval?Grayscale Bitcoin Trust shares are publicly traded on the over-the counter market OTCQX. In contrast with exchanges, such decentralized marketplaces normally host stocks of smaller companies and enforce less stringent reporting requirements.GBTC is currently listed under the Alternative Reporting Standard, which does not require registration with the SEC. An investment in OTC securities is generally considered riskier than in those traded on exchanges.While this solution facilitates Bitcoin exposure for accredited investors, the present reporting standard might be insufficient for many funds that are potentially interested in digital assets but wary of the lack of transparency. Others may simply have formal limitations on dealing with securities that do not have an SEC registration. Among other GBTC downsides that could be inhibiting investors??enthusiasm are annual fee and a high premium.Despite these limitations, the trust?ôs performance has been very solid this year. For one, in less than six months ??between February and June ??it recorded a spike of more than 300%, outperforming even Bitcoin itself, which had a 223% growth over the same period, due to increased premiums. In a recent interview with CNBC, Michael Sonnenshein, Grayscale?ôs managing director, touted the year-over-year tripling of last three-month GBTC trading volume.Sonnenshein also noted that the Grayscale Investment?ôs Bitcoin product is seeing impressive demand from institutional investors seeking digital asset exposure, with 84% of inflows in the third quarter of 2019 coming from noncrypto hedge funds.Also known as the General Form for Registration of Securities, SEC?ôs Form 10 is a filing designed to provide investors with all the relevant information they may need to make an investment decision.The Exchange Act requires companies with more than $10 million in assets and 750 or more shareholders to file a registration statement on Form 10, while those below these thresholds can do it voluntarily. A Form 10 registration is one of the requirements for registering securities to be traded on U.S. exchanges. Another is the approval by Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.A registration statement is deemed effective 60 days after filing, although the SEC might have additional questions or comments. Once it is in effect, the registration triggers a set of reporting requirements, including annual, quarterly and current reports; annual proxy statements; and beneficial ownership reporting for management and shareholders.Grayscale Investments??initiative is obviously directed at elevating its reporting standards, thus making GBTS appealing to a wider array of institutional investors. Apart from the potential distinction of becoming the first-ever SEC reporting digital asset-based security, it would also bring a tangible improvement improvement in liquidity.While investors are currently required to hold their private placement shares for at least one year, this period would be reduced to six months if the trust?ôs SEC registration is approved. Michelle Gitlitz, Crowell & Moring?ôs global head for its Blockchain and Digital Assets practice, told Cointelegraph:?úIf Grayscale reached reporting company status, it would increase transparency for investors and may encourage more people to invest in the fund. More investors means more liquidity for shareholders, which is a significant benefit. For certain, those investors who are currently restricted from investing in non-SEC regulated reporting companies, would be able to invest.?ùThe big question is: How much will Grayscale gain from a registration with the SEC? Alexander Blum, the chief operating officer of the fintech company Two Prime, thinks that it will facilitate gradual change rather than an instant explosion:?úIf its Form 10 filing is approved and it becomes an SEC registered reporting company, Grayscale's Bitcoin Trust will continue its incremental maturation into a mainstream investment vehicle with the oversight and heightened reporting requirements that come with that. However, I wouldn't expect a massive influx of new funds or listing on new exchanges, but continued, steady growth.?ùDmitriy Berenzon, a research partner at blockchain capital firm Zenith Ventures, is hopeful that GBTC?ôs registration will spark an industry-wide trend toward increased transparency:?úMy hope is that Grayscale's move will push more crypto companies to voluntarily disclose more comprehensive information on a more consistent basis. For example, while the Tezos Foundation publishes detailed biannual updates and the Ethereum Foundation publishes high-level quarterly updates, I'm looking forward to a time when we see detailed quarterly reports from all cryptoasset-related foundations.?ùBlum from Two Prime thinks that even though many other players in the digital asset space could be interested in following Grayscale?ôs example, it is a bar that only a few are able to clear:?úIt's not a massive gamechanger. Other players might be interested in replicating it, but from a logistical standpoint ??including quarterly reports to the SEC, auditing, accounting, and heavy legal and financial oversight ??it's expensive and labor-intensive. It's a very high barrier for new entrants to achieve what Grayscale is doing.?ùSpeaking of the odds of GBTC obtaining its desired status, Blum said that the trust is an excellent candidate for approval, given its current regulatory status and assets under management.¬†Unlike Bitcoin ETF applications, Grayscale is not seeking approval of a new, prospective product but is simply carrying on with an already operational and very successful product that has a track record.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Co-branded with Mastercard and UnionPay, card owners can top up using a plethora of digital currencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin. Crypto is automatically converted into cash, giving the user freedom to make withdrawals at cash machines and make purchases at any point of sale terminal. The company adds it is focused on supplying business-to-business solutions to customers worldwide.The team says extensive tests have been performed to ensure that its infrastructure is working correctly. One recent experiment saw 1 BTC (worth about $8,500 at the time of writing) loaded onto the card. Footage posted on YouTube appeared to show that the funds had successfully arrived and were available to spend in Singapore dollars. Other videos have shown the card working successfully in fast-food restaurants, and being used to purchase mobile phone data online.Embily?ôs founder, Alexander Bychkov, has said that one of his main motivations is ensuring that digital currencies such as Bitcoin can be used easily in everyday life. Some payment processing providers do allow merchants to accept crypto at the checkout, but this can be inconvenient for consumers who have to do plenty of research to track down these places. By offering instantaneous conversions and integrating into existing payment infrastructure, Bychkov hopes to remove this friction.The company also argues that far fewer people are using Bitcoin to buy goods and services than most crypto enthusiasts believe. Despite the fact that there are more than 7.7 billion people living on Earth according to the most current estimates, a recent study by the analytics firm Chainalysis found that just 1.3% of transactions came from merchants between January and April 2019.Embily hopes to help build these circulation figures higher ??emboldening crypto enthusiasts to buy dinner, pay for their parking and purchase in-game extras with ease. Its infrastructure is being offered on a white-label basis, meaning that the underlying technology can be used by crypto businesses that want to expand their reach and make life more convenient for their user base. Wallets and exchanges are listed among the types of platforms who could benefit.Over time, this could help cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin make the transition from being regarded as a store of value to a means of exchange. It could also help demystify coins and tokens in the eyes of the public, who often regard digital currencies as complicated and high-risk. If the process of topping up and spending crypto is as simple as making a deposit in a bank, it could remove a barrier to entry that has been holding millions of people back ??and even help regulators, including those who believe that BTC and ETH aren?ôt real currencies, begin to appreciate their value and place in society.Embily began life in Dubai back in June 2017, and another office in Bangkok was opened three months later. From late 2018 the company open its headquarters in Singapore and now operates there. The team includes finance professionals, experienced digital marketers and veteran developers. With staff from around the world and a diverse range of backgrounds, the company says it is international in outlook and determined to give clients the best service possible.Bychkov has recently shared his insights into Embily at a number of conferences, including Crypto Expo Singapore back in October and BlockShow Asia in November.Disclaimer.

One of them is VeChain (VET), a blockchain-based platform focused on enhancing supply chain management processes. The project is primarily focused on providing solutions that allow consumers and retailers to check the authenticity and quality of products they have purchased.¬†","Now with that said, there are heaps of altcoins out there that all aspire to solve a problem through the use of distributed ledger technology so what?ôs all the fuss about VeChain? Well, the altcoin has surged more than 100% in a matter of weeks and for crypto traders, this is very notable.For the first time since listing, VeChain managed to break the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA), as can be seen in the following chart.VET BTC 1-day chart. Source: TradingViewSome other notably entertaining keynotes can be found on VeChain?ôs daily chart. It?ôs not only moving above the 200-DMA and EMA, but it also broke a 14-month long downtrend. Similar to the breakout of the downtrend, a falling wedge pattern with bullish divergences marked the bottom during August and September of 2019.Remarkably, bullish divergences and falling wedge patterns are one of the most reliable bottom indicators when trading, and once again, they managed to be strict in the call. Given that this occurred in the daily timeframe, it often takes a while before the divergences become ?òactive.?ôAfter confirmation, a slightly higher low was constructed before the breakout of the longterm downtrend. Notably, one can be seen that there was a massive increase in volume after the break of the downtrend, which is a strong signal.VET BTC 6-hour chart. Source: TradingViewThe smaller timeframes give a clear view of VeChain?ôs price action. A regular breakout of the downtrend, including a retest at 0.00000041 Satoshis (sats) before the break upwards to 0.00000062 (sats), the next target. Only a slight retest and consolidation was needed to push the price further upwards. This breakout of 0.00000060 (sats) leads to a new increase in price, which is currently aiming for the range high at 0.00000080 to 0.00000082 (sats).Meanwhile, the relative strength index (RSI) is showing its highest level since listing on several timeframes. This could indicate that some period of cool-off is ready to occur for the altcoin.Other altcoins across the field show similarities in the strengths of their price action. For example, is ZRX (0x), was one of the first altcoins to break out of a longterm downtrend.ZRX BTC 1-day chart. Source: TradingViewAs can be seen in the chart, a breakout occurred with high volume after a similar falling wedge with bullish divergence was constructed. Alongside the breakout, ZRX moved towards June 2019 levels, which led to a 170% increase since the bottom.Furthermore, other altcoins are also beginning to take steps towards their longterm downtrend lines and some are currently trying to break out of it. Another good example is Ontology (ONT), which is now moving out of an 18-month long downtrend.ONT BTC 1-day chart. Source: TradingviewOntology broke out of a 5-month downtrend earlier in November. This push shifted the price towards the primary downtrend (18-months old) which has currently broken upward. If it is going to show price action similar to ZRX and move back towards the June 2019 price levels, a continued move towards 0.0001500 - 0.0001900 (sats) is not off of the books.VET USDT 1-day chart. Source: TradingViewThe USDT chart is showing some of the same signals as the Bitcoin chart. A heavy move upwards from the local bottom at $0.003 (which was also a falling wedge structure), slight consolidation, and eventual retracement of the range high of $0.006. This retracement leads to a strong bounce of the $0.0051 level which was previously a resistance that flipped support a few days ago.The price of VET in USDT is currently hovering around resistance with the RSI in overbought areas. The price needs to continue to produce green candles to prevent it from creating bearish divergences, a usual top signal.Given the movements of VeChain, a bullish scenario is more likely to occur than a bearish scenario, and there are several scenarios in place for the asset.The first scenario would be a straight copy of the movements before the break of 0.00000060 to 0.00000062 (sats) a few days ago. In that scenario, the price will continue moving towards the range high, consolidate a little bit and continue its way towards the next level at 0.00000100 (sats).VET BTC daily chart, bullish scenario. Source: TradingViewThe second scenario first requires a drop first, which is a short term bearish outlook.In that regard, we still have to take note of the height of the RSI on several timeframes. That could indicate a retracement and retest of the range lows at 0.00000060 - 0.00000062 (sats) before the price is ready to move to the range high at 0.000080 - 0.00000082 (sats). Traders might prefer to look for a long entry in that zone or play the breakout if VeChain flips the 0.00000080 (sats) zone as support.VET BTC daily chart, 2nd bullish scenario. Source: TradingViewA bearish view could occur if the VET/USDT pair is unable to continue showing strength, which would confirm the bearish divergences on higher timeframes. In that regard, traders might look for a retest of the 0.00000060 (sats) zone and a possible drop below that area.VET BTC daily chart, bearish scenario. Source: TradingViewGiven the strength of the altcoin and the volume behind the move, it?ôs less likely to occur. However, if VeChain retraces back to the range low and doesn?ôt find enough strength to bounce with volume, a possible retracement towards 0.00000050 (sats) is a real possibility.There are several reasons for a possible retracement, one could be Bitcoin making volatile movements which would cause the market to become chaotic all over again.At this point, powerful movements and more likely to continue to the range highs.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

However, the positive thing is that they have not allowed the price to fall below the moving averages. This shows that buyers are in no hurry to book profits and are initiating long positions on minor dips.The NEO/USD pair will pick up momentum above $13.88772. Above this level, a rally to $20.96333 will be on the cards. Therefore, traders can initiate long positions on a close (UTC time) above $13.88772 and keep a stop loss of $10. Contrary to our assumption, if the price turns down and breaks below the moving averages, it could dip to $6.65906.¬†¬†Chainlink (LINK) has again found a place amongst the top performers. It moved up by about 4% in the past seven days. Does the chart indicate an uptrend that is likely to carry it towards its lifetime highs? Let?ôs find out.The LINK/USD pair has been gradually moving higher in the past few weeks. The 20-week EMA is sloping up and the relative strength index (RSI) is in positive territory, which suggests that bulls are in command. While the buyers have managed to push the price above the overhead resistance at $2.8498, they have not been able to sustain at higher levels. This shows profit booking by the bulls closer to $3.However, we like the way the price has been making a higher low consistently for the past six weeks. This indicates that the sentiment is bullish.Currently, the bulls are again attempting to scale above the overhead resistance at $2.8498. If successful, a rally to $4.5826 will be on the cards. Conversely, if the bulls fail to sustain the price above $2.8498, a dip to the 20-week EMA is possible. This can be viewed as a buying opportunity. Our bullish view will be invalidated on a break below $1.46.¬†Cardano (ADA) was the third-best performer of the past seven days with a marginal rise of about 2%. During the week, Weiss Crypto Ratings tweeted that Cardano was superior to EOS, which divided the community, with some agreeing and others questioning the credibility of Weiss Ratings. This week Cardano completed the snapshot and balance check for its incentivized testnet on Nov.12. This will allow investors to earn rewards by delegating their stake. While there is development on the fundamental side, traders will be observing to see how this impacts the altcoin?ôs technical setup.Even though the ADA/USD pair has been rising gradually for the past few weeks, it lacks momentum. The up move will face resistance at the 20-week EMA and above it at the 50-week SMA. The 20-week EMA is sloping down and the RSI is in the negative zone, which suggests that the bears are at an advantage.A breakout of $0.0560221 to $0.0652290 resistance zone will be the first indication that the bulls are back in the game. Above $0.0652290, a move to $0.10 is possible. Contrary to our assumption, if the price turns down from the 20-week EMA, a retest of $0.0357780 is likely. We do not find any reliable buy setups at the current levels, hence, we remain neutral on it.Smartphone maker HTC will launch a limited edition of Exodus 1 that will support various Binance services. This is supposedly the first Binance Chain-ready smartphone. Binance will also be the first cryptocurrency exchange to integrate the Fiat Gateway solution announced by regulated blockchain company Paxos. This new service will allow users to swap between dollars and stablecoins on a one-to-one basis.¬†Binance added support for buying BTC, Ether (ETH) and XRP directly with Turkish lira through its local digital wallet partner Papara. Fundamentally the exchange has been making the right moves but does the price action indicate that Binance Coin (BNB) bottomed out?The breakout of the descending channel was the first indication that the bears were losing their grip. For the past two weeks, the bulls are facing stiff resistance at the 20-week EMA, which is flattening out.¬†However, we like that the BNB/USD pair has not given up ground. This increases the possibility of a breakout of the overhead resistance. If the price breaks out and closes (UTC time) above the 20-week EMA, a rally to $32 will be on the cards.Alternatively, if the bulls fail to push the price above the 20-week EMA, the pair might remain¬† range-bound between $21.2378 and $18.30 for a few weeks. Our bullish view will be invalidated if the price turns down and breaks below the support at $18.30.UNUS SED LEO (LEO) fell about 1% in the past seven days but still turned out to the fifth-best performer. This shows that the crypto markets are under pressure. Does the outperformance by LEO indicate demand at lower levels?The LEO/USD pair has been consolidating in a tight range of $1.05440 and $0.941 for the past few weeks. This shows a balance between demand and supply at the current levels. While the bulls are buying the dips to $0.941, the bears have been defending the resistance at $1.05440.A breakout of $1.0544 is likely to attract buying as it will indicate accumulation at lower levels by strong hands. Therefore, traders can buy on a close (UTC time) above $1.0544 and keep a stop loss of $0.94. The first target is a move to $1.35. Conversely, if the bears sink the pair below the support at $0.941, a drop to $0.866 and below it to $0.8278 is possible.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

Therefore, it is fitting that Bitcoin (BTC) broke into the limelight in 2009 and raised a lot of controversies right form the start.¬†","By design, all blockchain transactions are recorded on an immutable ledger. Therefore, even though it would take immense work, skilled auditors like Ernst & Young are able to find irregularities ??as opposed to fiat, which it is claimed that 99.9% of money laundering is not prosecuted by regulators.¬†Early on, criminals quickly realized the benefit of anonymous and decentralized trading, and thus started using cryptocurrencies to fund their illicit activities and to launder money. However, EY?ôs work shows that funds can be found on the public ledger. So, is money laundering by large criminal enterprises through cryptocurrency a major factor or will fiat remain preferred?The recent upsurge in cryptocurrency payments and related activities highlights the key fears surrounding cryptocurrencies being involved in money laundering. Despite strict regulations and increased vigilance by authorities, money laundering makes up a very small subsection of the overall cryptocurrency ecosystem.¬†Detailed research in 2018 by Elliptic and the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies??Center of Sanctions and Illicit Finance indicated that money laundering accounted for 1% of all Bitcoin transactions, which is the most widely used cryptocurrency. By comparison, a United Nations report titled ?úMoney-Laundering and Globalization??estimates that laundering with fiat currencies accounts for 2??% of all transactions.¬†Speaking to Cointelegraph, Anthony Pompliano, managing partner of Morgan Creek Digital, aptly noted, ?úThe choice currency of drug dealers, money launderers, and terrorists is still the US dollar.?ùWhile some local regulators have opted for or considered outright bans on cryptocurrency, the majority shows a desire to learn more about them in an attempt to positively regulate cryptocurrency.Cryptocurrencies have continually faced allegations of facilitating money laundering, while data continues to disprove this theory. For a while now, both local and intergovernmental regulators have warned about the potential for unhindered criminal activity that cryptocurrencies could help to facilitate ??so much so that the term ?úcryptocurrencies??has become synonymous with controversy for the general public rather than highlight the benefits blockchain provides.Commenting to Cointelegraph, Aviya Arika, the head of blockchain at global crypto regulations and payment solution legal firm Aviya Innovative Law, said:?úOn one hand, blockchain allows from anonymous (or pseudonymous) transactions which raises, as we?ôve seen and heard from many regulators and banks, substantial money laundering concerns. On the other hand, blockchain can be used a bit differently to enhance the fight against money laundering.?ùCurrent Anti-Money Laundering regulations are adopting strict standards to perceived threats, regardless that fiat is still the leader in money laundering. Many of the prominent cryptocurrency exchanges are adopting further centralized methods to prepare for a more regulated future.¬†Those in favor of resistance from cryptocurrency exchanges say that bowing down to regulatory authorities will turn cryptocurrencies into centralized institutions like banks. To blockchain purists, this goes against the very core of what digital assets stand for: decentralization, transparency, and public accountability.According to the report by Elliptic, ?úBitcoin has unique properties that can easily serve the interest of criminals.??The research further highlighted that Bitcoin?ôs alleged illicit use is mainly based on anecdotal evidence from two darknet outliers in blockchain, the Silk Road and Alpha Bay. While it is impossible to quantify how much Bitcoin is illicitly used, the same can be said about fiat currencies. However, with crypto, there is most likely going to be a record for regulators to monitor.¬†A 2019 law enforcement report from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission stated that $4.3 billion fines and disgorgements were levied against companies, both large and small, that committed fraudulent actions. This number has grown for the same period last year was $3.9 billion. Another uptick this report highlights is that the number of fines this year increased to 862 enforcement actions, from 821 in 2018. The SEC has returned $1.2 billion to harmed investors, as well as suspended 600 people and 271 companies from the securities markets.Further, the main highlights of the report focused on rooting out misconduct that harmed investors and markets related to a Ponzi scheme, affecting 8,400 investors. The Woodbridge Group of Companies LLC paid over $1 billion in penalties resulting from a real estate scheme, which was completely devoid of crypto. So, is crypto introducing new dangers or are these simply the same issues magnified by FUD?Related: Privacy Vs. Security, Do Authorities Monitor Every Crypto Transaction?Cryptocurrencies could potentially be a better channel for money laundering only when transactions are completely anonymous and private. However, many cryptocurrencies are traceable thanks to advancements in the technology. Criminals now cannot easily use this channel as they initially could thanks to leaders like EY and other auditors, even with private chains.From the perspective of tax evasion, blockchain makes it easier to keep a record of all transactions carried out on the network. Therefore, with clear regulation, calculating the tax due would be straightforward. These records can be instantly viewed and accounted for when the need arises.Blockchain technology makes it easier for governments and financial investigators to follow the money trail. The complete record of transactions is stored permanently in a shared ledger that ultimately ties back to a bank account and an identity.¬†For instance, Bitcoin?ôs public ledger presents all transactions right from the point fiat was converted into BTC. This makes it possible to identify criminals and their transactions. Such functionality is known as attribution and is something purists, like John McAfee, are attempting to circumvent.Despite this, many governments have not yet provided clear guidance on cryptocurrencies and have left regulations ambiguous, which is arguably harming the growth of the industry. For example, U.S. legislators are calling on the SEC to clarify regulatory guidelines on cryptocurrency. Governments leading on the path of cryptocurrency guidance are working on developing legal frameworks to regulate cryptocurrency use cases and manage taxation issues.¬†The key to developing an innovative crypto ecosystem that gains mass adoption lies in effective and efficient regulatory frameworks. Appropriate legislation must be in place to ensure cryptocurrencies are more legitimized across the globe. From the perspective of the global AML perspective, the following measures can help to curb any incidents of money laundering:Know Your Customer compliance has prompted many large financial institutions to consider developing their own blockchains. Banks are using the technology for several operations, including customer identification (as detailed above), which is the main action used to hamper money laundering.¬†Further regulation will bring about cryptographic protection by sharing updated records on a continuous basis with banks, exchanges and other regulatory parties. The risk now becomes how the data is stored and who performs the checks. This presents major centralization and security risks.If the only gateway to cryptocurrency is restricted to banks and government institutions, that may create further centralization issues for crypto. While blockchain technology can provide the compliance link between crypto exchanges and banks, it places a centralized power in between users??access to the decentralized world.¬†Speaking with Cointelegraph, Harish Gupta, CEO of Polybird ??a global marketplace for securities that is regulated in the U.S. under the SEC and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ??outlined how this currently works:?úIn the advanced smart contracts of security tokens, AML is rather quite simple. The tokens just won't transfer to a wallet address that is not KYC'ed and approved. Though many such smart contracts today are not very advanced so a lot of such works need to be done manually.?ùTherefore, it might be possible that employees of some banks or governments could abuse the KYC onboarding ecosystem for personal or political gain. For example, they might have access to useful information and possibly carry out insider trading or reverse transactions of rivals.¬†Another problem is that regulators disagree on the nature of cryptocurrencies, like whether to consider them as commodities, currencies or securities, making the interoperability of assets heavily restricted.¬†It is clear that cryptocurrencies themselves do not provide the best avenue for money laundering. Yet, cryptocurrencies have been involved in some of the largest public scams over the last decade.¬†Related: Scale of OneCoin Scam Unravels Amid Ongoing Court Hearings¬†Ponzi schemes, investment fraud and other forms of theft have further muddied the reputation of cryptocurrencies in the eyes of the public. Furthermore, the impact of these scams has pushed a negative light on cryptocurrencies, forcing regulatory action.¬†Speaking with Cointelegraph, Jude Regev, CEO of blockchain-based venture capital firm Jointer.io, stressed that ?údue diligence when investing is important yet increases the barrier of entry to only sophisticated investors while scaring mainstreet.?ù¬†¬†Fraud is not the only worry, North Korea has used hacking attacks to obtain $670 million in cryptocurrency and fiat, according the United Nations. The country allegedly targets financial institutions as well as cryptocurrency exchanges. As Cointelegraph previously reported, a 2018 study revealed that the hacker group ?úLazarus,??reportedly funded by North Korea, has stolen $571 million from cryptocurrency exchanges since early 2017.As with most new industry, there are some questions that remain, including: Where does the equilibrium between regulation and decentralization lie, and how can it be achieved?¬†The choke point for the risk of money laundering is where crypto is cashed out from exchanges and transferred into banks, and this is where regulators are focusing. If exchanges establish a stringent compliance standard that meets or exceeds regulatory expectations, the risks can be significantly mitigated ??although centralization then becomes a worry. The perception of governments and traditional financial institutions concerning cryptocurrencies could ease and open the doors for widespread adoption.¬†Regulatory institutions will continue to stress the need to improve AML practices because of the absence of clear legislation related to cryptocurrency exchanges ??and because of perceived danger rather than actual risk. Due to this reason, many centralized exchanges and businesses will continue to adopt robust AML policies out of choice rather than obligation for fear of reprisal.¬†The crypto ecosystem is surrounded by myths and FUD. Being a nascent technology, it is quite normal for the general public to act skeptical toward something new and unknown, and for the industry itself to sway toward conformation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They enable ecosystem connectivity by sharing information in trustless, decentralized fashion.Ming highlighted several use cases where blockchain connects different ecosystems to create new value for the internet, citing IBM's Food Trust network as used by Carrefour, and several other partners connecting supply chains to provide more product transparency.Vinay pointed out that there is much debate about whether blockchains operated by governments and industries are truly decentralized or not. According to him, it?ôs not so important ??there are several ways to understand centralization versus decentralization.?úWe are talking here about an intermediate technology that connects different ecosystems providing a new form of governance,??said Mohan.On the other hand, Tan stressed that in addition to cryptocurrencies, blockchain enables the creation of a new ecosystem in which industries can work together to share information, creating new use cases, and create new forms of social interaction:?úBeyond cryptocurrency, blockchain technology is about collaboration. It's a collaborative technology that allows different actors to work together sharing and consuming data. That's amazing for governments, private institutions, and how society can create new things,??she said.In the same vein, Yeo pointed out that blockchain connects different parts of ecosystems and creates a completely different framework for governments and industries. ?úThis is a new value industry.

But we no longer believe them. How can we? [...] The noise destroys the environment, destroys people?ôs health because of the stress. [...] We had peace and quiet, and we want peace and quiet to return.?ùBitfarms reportedly manages five mining operations spread across the province to take advantage of cheap local hydropower. The firm struck a deal with Sherbrooke to pay the city about 3 million Canadian dollars (about $2.25 million) per year for its electricity use.City councilor Marc Denault admitted that, if the city had known about the noise generated by the facility?ôs cooling fans, it would not have allowed it to use the location. The councilor also said he believes that if the company foresaw such issues, it would not have chosen its present location.Denault also said that the company intended to address the noise issue and will renovate the building and build a wall outside it to muffle the sound. He claimed that an increase in the capacity of the farm will not increase the noise, stating:?úWe expect significant improvement versus what the residents are allegedly complaining about today.?ùDenault?ôs claims that the company is cooperative in solving noise problems are backed up by Patrick Melchior, mayor of Farnham, another place where Bitfarm operates. He said that residents had similar complaints in 2017, but the company has since improved the situation:?úThey were very cooperative. Their goal was really not to be a bad corporate citizen. [...] They reduced the noise considerably .. and the citizens were very satisfied. The case is closed.?ùCointelegraph reached out to councilmembers from the aforementioned cities but has not received any responses as of press time.According to Google Finance, BitFarms??stocks are trading at 0.53 Canadian dollars ($0.40). This means that the shares are down over 75% from when they were listed in July.Despite uncertain market conditions, cryptocurrency mining firms are seemingly optimistic when it comes to the future of their industry. As Cointelegraph reported yesterday, German Bitcoin (BTC) mining firm Northern Bitcoin has entered a merger agreement with United States-based competitor Whinstone to jointly build what will supposedly be the world?ôs largest mining farm.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After the recent rally, is it a good time to book profits or can the move up extend further?XTZ/USDT weekly chart. Source: TradingviewThe bulls have held the support at $0.829651 for the past few months. This indicates that buyers have been eyeing dips down to this support level to accumulate. The XTZ/USD pair has surged this week and has risen above both moving averages. It can now move up to $1.85. The pair has been pushed back down from this resistance on two previous occasions, hence, a breakout would be a significant event.On a close above $1.85, a rally to $2.87 and above it to $3.37 is likely. Therefore, traders can buy on dips close to $1.1 levels.

Source: TradingviewThe ATOM/USD pair has found support close to $2 levels thrice in the past few months. This shows that bulls have been buying on dips to the support levels. With the rally this week, the price has scaled above the overhead resistance at $3.6043, thus completing a triple bottom formation.¬†It now has a minimum target objective of $5.2985. If the bulls push the price above this level, a rise to $7 is possible. Therefore, traders can buy on a close (UTC time) above $3.6043 and keep a stop loss of $2.90. Contrary to our assumption, if the price turns around from the current levels and plummets below $3.6043, it will suggest a lack of demand at higher levels.¬†Stellar (XLM) surged on the news that the Stellar Development Foundation (SDF) had burned over 55 billion of the 85 billion tokens that were set aside for SDF operations, giveaway programs and partnership programs.¬†The foundation said that the burning was done because it wanted to be leaner and more efficient.

This shows that the markets have rejected the lower levels. Both moving averages are flattening out and the RSI has risen to just below 50 levels, which shows that the sellers are losing their grip.If the bulls can defend the support at $0.072545 during the next dip, it will be a positive sign. On the upside, the pair will pick up momentum on a breakout of $0.088708 and the 50-week SMA. Above the 50-day SMA, a rally to $0.145 will be on the cards.Therefore, traders can initiate long positions on a close (UTC time) above the 50-week SMA and keep a stop loss of $0.067. Our bullish view will be negated if the price turns down from $0.088708 and sustains below $0.072545.Litecoin (LTC) has been attempting to form a bottom in the past few days.

Source: TradingviewThe LTC/USD pair has broken out of the downtrend line and is attempting a recovery. If it sustains above $62.0764, it will suggest that the lower levels are attracting buyers. There is a minor resistance at the moving averages above which a move to $80.2731 will be on the cards. The flattening moving averages and the RSI moving up slowly suggests that the bulls are making a comeback.Though positive, we do not find a reliable buy setup at the current levels, hence, we are not recommending to trade it. Our bullish view will be invalidated if the pair turns down and plunges below the recent lows of $47.1851.EOS rounded up the top five crypto performers of the past seven days with a rally of about 8%. There have been complaints of congestion in the network but it has not affected its price. Has it bottomed out? Let?ôs find out.EOS/USD weekly chart. Source: TradingviewThe EOS/USD pair has risen close to the moving averages, which are likely to act as minor resistance. If the bulls can push the price above this resistance, a move to $4.8719 is likely. The flattening moving averages and RSI just below the center indicate that the selling pressure has reduced.Contrary to our assumption, if the pair turns down from the moving averages and plummets below the recent lows of $2.4001, it can retest the yearly low. However, we give it a low probability of occurring. We do not find a trade setup that offers a good risk to reward ratio at the current levels, hence, we are not recommending taking a long position in it.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

Blockchain News ¬∑ Business News ¬∑ Technology News ¬∑ Policy & ...",21-Nov-19,"Society is now witnessing the implementation of digital currencies, AI and blockchain technology worldwide. These new digital technologies require a high consumption of electricity, currently produced predominantly using coal and fossil fuels that adversely impact the environment. A global shift toward green energy will require the removal of the existing regulatory barriers on technology, infrastructure, finance and tax policy. In this series, my articles evaluate the tax, digital technology and solar policies (including space power satellites) of the countries that emit the highest volumes of carbon dioxide.","Proving the heliocentric model of our solar system put forward by European scientists Aristarchus of Samos (310??30 BC, Greece), Nicolaus Copernicus (1473??543, Poland), Galileo Galilei (1564??642, Italy) and Johannes Kepler (1571??630, Germany) took 2,200 years, when the German?ìAmerican spaceflight, the Helios 2 solar probe, cruised within 26.55 million miles¬†(42.73 million kilometers) of the sun in April of 1976. Now, the European Union is solarizing its digital economy at a much faster pace.¬†With renewable energy projected to comprise 90% of the electricity mix in Europe by 2040, three major factors are contributing to this paradigm shift in energy.Technological: Blockchain-based digital technologies are decentralizing and democratizing the electricity supply by enabling the interoperability of solar cell photovoltaic, or PV, energy produced from diversified PV assets with micro and macro/utility electric grids. This is keeping EU-based companies that perform efficiently, even in cloudy conditions, at the forefront of space-grade and liquid PV innovation.Economic: Solar energy is an increasingly attractive alternative from an economic standpoint due to the declining cost of solar energy, demand for solar PV panel installations in the EU?ôs smart cities, an¬†increase in CO2¬†costs attributable to carbon taxes and environmental lawsuit fines, net metering subsidies, as well as funding ??including from the European Investment Bank ??in the renewable energy sector, as¬†reported by the United Nations Environment Program.Environmental: Solar energy does not produce CO2 emissions, thereby improving air pollution and pollinator habitats to avoid a climate change apocalypse. A potential meltdown is relevant to the EU, as it ranks third in the world for CO2 emissions.¬†Related: Japan to Solarize Its Burgeoning Digital Economy, Expert TakeThe EU?ôs commitment to solarizing its digital economy in order to lower its CO2 levels in accordance with UNFCCC?ôs 2015 Paris Agreement is backed by various initiatives undertaken both in space and on Earth.The European Space Agency is a space, weather and CO2-emission watchdog. With the Copernicus Climate Change Service¬†satellite, it keeps tabs on the CO2 levels of all countries around the world. But since satellites are expensive to build and launch, and are difficult to update once in orbit, the ESA also utilizes a fleet of PV-energized, high-altitude pseudo-satellite, or HAPS. A zeppelin-like HAPS called the ?úStratobus??is currently being manufactured by Thales Alenia Space in Cannes to track CO2 emissions.The ESA has also been actively evaluating the possibilities of utilizing Solar Power Satellites by formulating a European strategy to solarize earthbound electric grids. France?ôs Airbus Defence and Space is building an SPS that intends to beam earthbound solar energy via high-powered infrared lasers by 2030. Airbus is also making a HAPS called ?úZephyr,??as well as a larger version of it that can be used for communications, reconnaissance, deliveries and even laser solar energy transmission. The world?ôs first HAPS base is already in operation at Wyndham Airfield in Australia.The ESA also continues to develop the different areas of solar electric propulsion required for deep space exploration missions. With the first picture of a black hole published in the spring of this year, the future may involve ?úusing solar electric propulsion to explore black holes for alternate energy sources,??according to film producer Andrew Lauren of the French science fiction film Highlife, which centers on the same topic.Over half of the world?ôs population live in cities that contribute 70% of the global energy-related greenhouse gas emissions. ?úCities around the world are the main cause of climate change but can also offer a part of the solution to reducing the harmful greenhouse gases that are causing global temperatures to rise,??explained U.N.-Habitat Executive Director Maimunah Mohd Sharif.Germany became the EU?ôs climate change pioneer with its¬†Energiewende¬†(energy transition) policy when it began installing PV rooftop solar panel systems in 1999 that now represent about 23% of all solar power generation capacity installed worldwide. More than a million German buildings now have solar panels on their roofs, with 1 out of every 2 new orders accompanied with a battery storage system.¬†A decade later, the Danish island of Sams√∏ emerged as the poster child of action against climate change, as it has been carbon neutral for over 10 years. This inspired Spain?ôs Balearic Islands, followed by another 26 European islands ??including the world?ôs cryptocurrency hub, Malta ??to commit earlier this year to transition to 100% renewable energy and ditch coal power.¬†So far, most EU countries have committed to phasing out coal plants by 2038, since they are the most significant source of air pollution, indifferent to political agendas, and not contained by the national or city borders of the 28 EU member states. Austria ??which is fully phasing out coal by 2020 ahead of other EU countries ??is home to a solar company called Smartflower, which manufactures intelligent solar panels shaped like flowers that move along with the position of the sun. As coal-fired power generation can be replaced by installing solar PV panels everywhere ??on coal mining sites, building rooftops and agricultural land ??to.reduce CO2 pollution. Already, a former coal plant in Germany ??where solar energy tops the list of sources for public electricity supply ??is reinventing itself as a Cultural Center for experimental/electrical art that is fueled by green energy.¬†Under the¬†Horizon 2020 project, 70 EU cities are switching to clean energy sources that are digitally distributed using artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things and blockchain-enabled networks. Germany leads the way in EU?ôs digitalization of the energy sector, as outlined in its Blockchain Strategy. ?úGenerating cheap green energy is no longer a challenge. The price of PV installations has tumbled over the last 10??0 years, so we?ôre now seeing huge investments in this particular energy source. The challenge is to link energy production from myriads of small installations across the landscape with a country?ôs total energy demand and energy production from other sources, some of which is also linked across national borders,??explained Marta Victoria, a professor who investigated and mapped the capacities of solar PV generation in the European countries that vary considerably from one state to another.Providing the solar digital link by creating smart-city energy districts are: Hivepower, ABB, Space10, Sonnen-TenneT, EDF Energy and UK Power Reserve, Insolar, SMA Solar Technology and Iota. On the latter, ?úThe IOTA Tangle brings the promise of Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT) to the Internet-of-Things. A growing energy community of private and public enterprises and academia are now coming together to explore its potential in real world testbed environment, paving the way for a more open, transparent and decentralized energy system,??Wilfried Pimenta de Miranda ??the business development director at the Iota Foundation, which is part of the CityxChange H2020 consortium ??said in an email.?úPollution often is a silent killer and is one of the greatest health hazards in Amsterdam,??explained the city?ôs traffic councilor, Sharon Dijksma, about Amsterdam?ôs ban on gasoline and diesel-fueled cars and motorcycles by 2030. Similarly, other zero-carbon smart cities of the EU will need to address the role of solarized electric transportation and the blockchain-based energy network that will enable the interoperability between PV-energized transportation ??such as cars, bikes, flying water taxis and roads ??and the electric grid, particularly in light of Volkswagen?ôs ?údieselgate??emissions-cheating scandal.¬†The German Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems has developed a solar car roof with highly efficient solar cells to extend the driving range of electric cars as well as a new solar cell textile that is woven into truck tarps to power onboard equipment. Audi?ôs A8 already features a solar sunroof, and another two PV electric car companies ??German Sono Motors and Dutch Lightyear ??are working toward putting their cars on the road by 2021. U.S. electric car manufacturer Tesla plans to invest $4.4 billion in a Berlin factory to manufacture the company?ôs SUV Model Y, which could be produced as early as 2021. The Mobility Open Blockchain Initiative is developing a blockchain-based Electric Vehicle Grid Integrator that will connect electric cars to the grid, while other solar energy blockchain projects include an electric car charger and a car wallet with a wide variety of use cases, including ride-sharing technology that allows the deployment of underutilized personal vehicles to provide rides.Related: Is US Environmental Tax Policy Hindering Solar Power to Fuel Digital Technologies?The world?ôs first dockless ride-sharing program was designed by Luud Schimmelpennink in Amsterdam in 1965 to counter the rise of pollution from cars. Called the ?úwhite bike??program, bicycles could be borrowed and left anywhere in the city to be borrowed again by the next individual. However, the dockless bike-sharing system was unsuccessful due to vandalism and theft.¬†Ever since, there have been at least five generations of evolution in bike-sharing programs put forward, driven mostly by advances in digital and PV technology. The second-generation bike-sharing program was born in Denmark in 1991, which allowed bikes to be picked up and returned to several central locations with a coin deposit. Theft was also a problem in this case, largely due to user anonymity. The third generation of bike-sharing systems was born in Portsmouth University in England and involved several technological improvements, such as bike docks that locked electronically, onboard electronics tracking user identity, swipe cards and telecommunication capabilities. The French cities of Lyon and Paris launched highly successful third-generation bike-sharing programs during the early 2000s and were followed by many cities around the world. The fourth-generation bike-sharing program, which won the Genomineerd voor de Computable Award in 2017, utilizing blockchain technology to track the identities of electric bike users and accepting payment in cryptocurrencies, was jointly developed by the Netherland Vehicle Licensing Agency and IBM, called ?úBikeBlockchain.??Today, an electric bike company based in the United Kingdom called ??0 Cycles??manufactures cryptocurrency-mining e-bikes, enabling electric bike-share riders to mine cryptocurrency while peddling to earn their crypto fees, with a German company called ?úMobility House??producing the chargers for these electric bikes. The Swiss city of Zug ??or ?úCrypto Valley????was the first city to implement this fourth-generation bike-sharing program, which utilizes uPort?ôs eID program to track user identity¬†and AirBie for payments in Ether (ETH).¬†The fifth-generation, solarized, docked electric bike-sharing program was designed by Christopher Cherry, Stacy Worley and David Jordan of the University of Tennessee, Knoxville in 2010. A U.S. bike company called ?úElectric Bike Company??recently began manufacturing solarized electric bikes. However, Cherry said in an email, ?úI haven?ôt seen anything more than a pilot test like ours,??regarding the implementation of the fifth-generation bike-sharing program so far. Nevertheless, PV panels are already energizing bike paths and roads of European cities.The world?ôs first solar bike path, SolaRoad ??a 70-meter stretch of bike path between two suburbs of Amsterdam that generates solar power from rugged, textured, glass-covered photovoltaic cells ??has been in operation since 2014. The world?ôs first solar PV road ??a patented French innovation that combines road construction and photovoltaic techniques ??was installed in 2016 in France by Wattway. Similarly, the world?ôs first electrified road that recharges the batteries of electric cars and trucks from two rails opened in Stockholm in 2018.¬†Related: Is US Environmental Tax Policy Hindering Solar Power to Fuel Digital Technologies?The EU has the authority to develop a unified energy policy under the 2009 Lisbon Treaty. The European Commission?ôs Directorate-General for Energy is responsible for implementing the EU?ôs Renewable Energy Directive to transition to a low-carbon economy with the aim of becoming the global leader in renewable energy. The Renewable Energy Directive foresees that EU member states reaching a certain percentage of renewable energy by 2020. However, member states are free regarding the choice of support instruments for reaching these targets. The EU launched the Blockchain Observatory and has developed various blockchain related legislative and policy under the European Data Protection Supervisor.High-level industry standards for data protection, interoperability and sharing of key blockchain technologies used in peer-to-peer energy trading, smart grids, metering and aggregators was established by the Digitalization & Solar Task Force of Solar Power Europe. Danish blockchain company DataHub is developing a system to ensure meeting these standards in the electricity market.Environmental tax policy: The power to levy taxes is central to the sovereignty of EU member states, which have assigned only limited competences to the EU in this area. Therefore, the EU lacks a coherent renewable energy or digital tax policy.Carbon taxes provided the 28 EU nations and Norway more than 400 billion euros ($450 billion) in gas and oil taxation revenues in 2015.The EU ranks number four in subsidies to the hydrocarbon industry, at $289 billion, which is failing to decrease despite the bloc?ôs commitment to the Paris Agreement on climate change targeting net-zero emission levels.¬†State aid issues: Since the EU lacks a uniform tax regulator, energy tax and renewable energy subsidies are monitored by the EU Anti-Trust Commission, which is in charge of policing state aid that skews competition within the EU.The guidelines on state aid for 2014 through 2020 allow aid to renewable electricity generation granted as a premium in addition to the market price (feed-in premium) in an open, competitive bidding process on a nondiscriminatory basis.¬†For example, EU state aid law does not allow Germany?ôs tax rebates on solar power modules and other renewable energy installations of up to 2 megawatts, while Germany?ôs parliamentary finance committee (Finanzausschuss) has voted to align national taxation with EU laws.¬†The collective commitment to renewable energy made by the International Renewable Energy Agency and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change did not stop the record-hitting heat waves that extended across Europe this summer and shut down power plants. ?úTime is running out ??we are already seeing worsening climate change impacts around the world ??including unprecedented heatwaves ??and we need to grasp all opportunities to rapidly deploy clean, renewable energy at scale to prevent the worst climate scenarios from becoming a reality,??Patricia Espinosa, executive secretary of the UNFCCC pointed out. The World Meteorological Organization published new data showing 2014??9 to be the warmest five-year period on record.Further digitization in the EU is inevitable, with the financial sector set on establishing a blockchain payment system by 2020 to compete with blockchain-based payment systems developed by China and the U.S., a cryptocurrency-based trade finance mechanism called Instrument in Support of Trade Exchanges and the digital currency ?úEurocoin.?ù¬†Blockchain in the energy market is set to grow fivefold from its current market value to over $25 billion by 2024, as reported in a study by Global Market Insights, Inc. But on the bright side, the EU?ôs digitization will be solarized, with PV installations doubling in the next three years according to a Wood Mackenzie report, and self-consumption accounting for almost 40% of all new capacity installed according to the Europe Solar PV Market Outlook 2019. France has opened Europe's largest floating solar farm. ?úThe EU and China are the parties that can take this forward,??said Frank Rijsberman, director general of the Global Green Growth Institute.Selva Ozelli, Esq., CPA is an international tax attorney and CPA who frequently writes about tax, legal and accounting issues for Tax Notes, Bloomberg BNA, other publications and the OECD.

Muzinich, who assumed office as Deputy Secretary of the Treasury in ...",22-Nov-19,The United States Deputy Treasury Secretary argued that decentralized privately-issued digital currencies can shift some functions from the state to the private sector.,"Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Justin Muzinich presented his view on the emerging ecosystem of financial intermediation and digital currencies at an annual banking and payments conference in New York on Nov. 21. The keynote by Muzinich was published on the official website of the United States Department of the Treasury.The recent conference was co-hosted by the U.S. Clearing House and Bank Policy Institute.Speaking at the conference, Muzinich addressed issues associated with digital currencies alongside regulatory and tax reform and the intersection of economic policy and national security. In his statement, Muzinich continued a common Treasury narrative on concerns that cryptocurrencies can be used for illicit practices such as money laundering.The Deputy Secretary emphasized that these concerns remain one of the top issues concerning the authority:?úOne of the issues at the top of Treasury?ôs mind is that digital currencies can potentially be used to evade existing legal frameworks ??like those governing taxation, anti-money laundering, and countering the financing of terrorism.?ùMuzinich stated that the Treasury values innovation and welcomes efficiency improvements, but stressed that innovation powered by digital currencies needs a ?úvery hard look.??He added that decentralized, privately-issued digital currencies are not simply a means of payment, but also tools that can shift functions traditionally performed by the government to the private sector. He said:?úDigital currencies at scale raise not only concrete questions about money laundering, monetary policy, and other topics, but also very abstract questions about self-government. Those engaged in digital currency markets should therefore expect that policymakers, in pursuing the public interest, will take a very hard look at these issues.""The fresh remarks from Muzinich, who assumed office as Deputy Secretary of the Treasury in late 2018, are a logical extension from some previous statements delivered by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.In July 2019, Mnuchin criticized the major cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC), saying that it can be used for money laundering, and the authority will be preventing it from becoming an ?úequivalent of Swiss-numbered bank accounts.??Notably, Mnuchin declared that cash is not laundered like Bitcoin.In mid-October, the Treasury agreed to the need for an investigation into Facebook?ôs forthcoming Libra stablecoin following a letter from Representative Emanuel Cleaver.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since November 2017, the dominance of BTC had fallen from 56.5% to 52.6%, with altcoins gaining an overall 47.4% market share of crypto capitalization.However, the number of tokens with a known capitalization had risen 75.8% to 1,732, increasing competition among altcoins for a shrinking pool of liquidity ??with the combined capitalization of altcoins having dropped from $107.2 billion to $86.8 billion just 12 months later.Despite the number of crypto assets having increased by a further 16.7% since November 2018, the combined altcoin capitalization reduced by roughly 8% to $80 billion during the past year. As such, altcoins have seen increased proliferation in the face of a declining pool of liquidity for two consecutive years.Between November 2017 and November 2018, the relative market share of alternative cryptocurrencies became more pluralized, with the share of capitalization represented by altcoins sitting outside of the top 10 by market cap, increasing from 23.3% to 28.4% despite the dramatic rise in the number of markets.The greater pluralism in the distribution of altcoin capitalization in 2018 can be largely attributed to a decline in the relative market share of Ether (ETH) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) throughout the 12 months prior. Together, ETH and BCH had shed 23% of altcoins??relative market share in one year.Of the 10 largest altcoins by market cap on Nov. 18, 2017, only XRP?ôs market share increased throughout the next year, becoming the largest altcoin by capitalization and representing 22.8% of the combined altcoin market cap on Nov. 17, 2018.While Litecoin (LTC) and Monero (XMR) both remained in the top 10 ranking of altcoins by market cap between November 2017 and November 2018, both tokens suffered losses in relative market share.LTC fell by one rank, from fifth to fourth, shedding nearly a third of its relative market share in the process ??from 3.7% during November 2017 to 2.8% one year later. XMR also fell one rank, from eighth to ninth, with its market share dropping from 1.9% to 1.7%.Dash, NEO, Iota, Nem (XEM) and Ethereum Classic (ETC) all fell from the top 10 altcoins by capitalization as their relative market share declined in 2018. They did, however, retain their rank among the top 20.Related: A Different Look at Crypto Market and Top Assets, How Dominated Is It?Dash fell from fifth, with an altcoin market share of 3.3%, to rank 12th with 1.3%; NEO fell from sixth with 2.5% to 15th with 0.9%; Iota fell from seventh with 2.3% to 11th with 1.3%; NEM moved from ninth with 1.8% to 14th with 0.9%; and ETC fell from 10th with 1.7% all the way to 16th place with 0.9%.As of Nov. 17, 2018, the relative market share represented by the alternative cryptocurrencies ranked third to 10th by capitalization had increased from 17.2% to 19.9%, with XLM, EOS, Tether (USDT), Cardano (ADA) and Tron (TRX) having emerged among the top 10 altcoins by market cap.In just 12 months, XLM rose from the 20th-ranked altcoin, representing a relative market share of 0.6%, to the fourth-largest alternative cryptocurrency, with 5.5% of total altcoin capitalization.EOS also climbed, from 14th with 0.88% in 2017 to rank fifth with 4.7% in 2018, while Tether grew from 19th with 0.7% to place sixth with 2%, and ADA grew from 18th with 0.7% to seventh with 1.8%, while TRX produced the most dramatic growth, climbing from the position of 53rd-largest altcoin with a relative market share of 0.1% to rank tenth with 1.4%.During 2019, altcoin capitalization has significantly centralized among the top alternative currencies by market cap. Currently, the 2,011 alternative cryptocurrencies that do not rank among the top 10 by market cap are competing for just 20.61% of the total combined capitalization.In 12 months, ETH has restored its ranking as the largest altcoin by market cap and increased its market share by a quarter, currently representing 25.1% of the total altcoin market capitalization.XRP now ranks as the second-largest alternative cryptocurrency by market cap following a 39% drop in relative market share, which currently sits at 14.2%. Despite BCH seeing another 12-month decline in altcoin market share, the token retained its distinctive position as the third-largest alternative cryptocurrency by market cap, with BCH now representing 6% of altcoin capitalization.As such, the relative dominance of the three largest altcoins has increased 7% year-on-year from 51.7% to 55.4%.The market share of altcoins represented by the tokens ranking from third to 10th by capitalization also increased for the second consecutive year, currently representing 24% of the combined altcoin market cap.The relative market share of Tether increased by 160% between November 2018 and November 2019, with USDT ranking as the fourth-largest alternative cryptocurrency and comprising 5.2% of all altcoin value.LTC also saw a significant gain in market share, with LTC currently ranking as the fifth-largest alternative cryptocurrency by market cap after its relative market share increased by 66% to 4.7%.The sixth-largest altcoin by capitalization, Binance Coin (BNB), has risen from the 13th-ranked altcoin due to a 230% gain in market share and currently represents 3.9% of altcoin value. The seventh-ranked altcoin, Bitcoin SV (BSV), also constitutes a new entrant among the top 10 altcoins, representing 2.79%.TRX saw an 11.4% gain in relative altcoin dominance, currently ranking as the 10th-largest alternative crypto asset, with a market share of 1.6%.Despite the increasing centralization of altcoin capitalization among the top markets over recent years, many alternative cryptocurrencies have seen a significant increase in trade activity.On Nov. 18, 2017, the 10 most-traded cryptocurrencies reportedly generated $7.1 billion worth of trade during 24 hours. BTC, BCH and ETH amassed a combined 24-hour volume exceeding $1 billion, while eight tokens including USDT, NEO, LTC, XRP and ETC also produced a daily volume greater than $100 million. Overall, 23 crypto assets posted eight-figure volumes or higher.Despite the brutal bear trend of 2018, the combined daily volume reported by the 10-most traded tokens had increased 66.8% by Nov. 17, 2018. Only three of 2017?ôs 10-most traded tokens saw a decline in volume, with BCH, Dash and Iota seeing a dip in trade activity. During the period, 14 cryptocurrencies each garnered a 24-hour trade volume exceeding $100 million, and 36 other assets boasted a volume of more than $10 million.This time around, the 10-most traded cryptocurrencies produce $56.8 billion in daily volume ??an increase totaling 381% year-on-year and 700% over the last 24 months.None of 2018?ôs most popular tokens have posted a reduction in trade volume, despite BSV and TRX replacing ZEC and NEO among the top ten. USDT, BTC, ETH, LTC, BCH, EOS and XRP posted 24-hour volumes exceeding $1 billion, while 33 other tokens reported more than $100 million in daily trade and nearly 150 tokens continuously producing more than $10 billion worth of trades.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
117,https://cointelegraph.com,09-Nov-19,Her Majesty the Queen Rules Out Crypto as Currency,https://cointelegraph.com/news/her-majesty-the-queen-rules-out-crypto-as-currency,"After 11 years of Bitcoin's existence, countries around the world are 
creating clarity for taxpayers regarding crypto activity. Will 2020 be the 
year ...",09-Nov-19,"Only a few weeks after the United States Internal Revenue Service published new guidance for crypto taxation, the United Kingdom?ôs tax, payments and customs authority, Her Majesty?ôs Revenue and Customs, has updated its cryptocurrency taxation policy paper for businesses and individuals.","The HMRC's approach in this policy paper is, as expected, conservative, and it stands in line with other countries??tax treatment for cryptocurrencies. The HMRC explicitly states that it does not consider crypto as a currency, and the policy paper uses the term ""cryptoassets"" and not cryptocurrency.The policy paper on individuals considers crypto activity as a personal investment subject to capital gains tax that should be paid when crypto is sold for fiat, using crypto to pay for goods or services, gifting crypto or ??unlike the position of the French tax authority ??exchanging crypto for crypto.Capital gains tax is commonly used to tax crypto activity in many countries, such as the U.S. and Israel. However, while other countries are struggling to draw the line between personal activity and professional trading, the HMRC states that crypto would fall into the definition of business activity ""only in exceptional circumstances,??continuing:?úHMRC expects individuals to buy and sell cryptoassests with such frequency, level of organization and sophistication that the activity amounts to a financial trade in itself.?ùThe policy paper states that an employee?ôs salary and mining activity are subject to income tax.Mining activity by individuals can also be classified as a business activity. The HMRC will review several factors to decide on the classification, such as degree of activity, organization, risk and commerciality.If the mining activity does not amount to a trade, any crypto awarded for successful mining ??or any other mining fee ??will be taxable as income. If it falls under the classification of business activity, then corporate tax and a value-added tax may be due. In cases where the individual did not sell immediately and was awarded crypto, they will be subject to capital gains tax when that crypto is sold or exchanged.Airdrops can be treated as capital gains or as income tax, depending on the circumstances. If the airdrops are being given in the event of a chain split or in any other case that does not constitute a payment for providing a service or business activity, it will be treated as capital gains tax. If it is related to any service or other conditions, it will be taxed as income.If you are paying income tax on crypto activities, you may also offset your losses from trades against future profits or other income.It seems as if someone in the HMRC understands the tax ramifications of the volatile crypto market. The policy paper attempts to prevent crypto trades that use the volatile market to manipulate the taxes due. The paper has a specific rule for crypto acquired within 30 days of selling. This rule will apply if an individual acquires tokens and sells or exchanges them within 30 days of the disposal of the same token type. Those who will buy and sell the same tokens will not be subjected to capital loss up to the amount of the new tokens purchase on those dates.The HMRC?ôs conservative approach also applies to business activity. Crypto companies will not find crypto-friendly tax benefits under Her Majesty?ôs policy.U.K.-based crypto companies are subject to corporation tax on their profits and gains. Any goods or services sold in exchange for crypto tokens are subject to VAT.With that being said, the HMRC decided that under the Value Added Tax Act 1994, financial services supplied by crypto exchanges or any services required to exchange tokens are exempt from VAT.Companies paying salaries in crypto are subject to income tax and national insurance contributions on the value of the asset.The U.K.?ôs ?ústamp duty reserve tax??is charged on stocks and securities. The HMRC does not consider crypto as a stock or security, and therefore, there will be no stamp duty reserve tax on crypto business activity in the U.K.Without a doubt, 2019 will be marked as the year of crypto tax guidance. After 11 years of Bitcoin?ôs existence, countries around the world are creating clarity for taxpayers regarding crypto activity. Will 2020 be the year that finally shows a significant increase in tax filings?

non-privacy coins, since amounts are safely encrypted. But Mimblewimble ...",23-Nov-19,"On Nov. 18, crypto researcher Ivan Bogatyy published an article on Medium claiming that he had found an extremely easy way of bypassing Grin?ôs Mimblewimble privacy protocol. As part of his efforts, Bogatyy stated that he was able to trace over 96% of all Grin-related transactions in real time, including the addresses of the senders as well as recipients associated with these sets of transactions.","What?ôs more striking is the fact that Bogatyy claims he was able to achieve all this by spending just $60 a week on Amazon Web Services computational power, which helped connect him to Grin?ôs native blockchain nodes.¬†Not only that, but the Google AI research alum also claims that he could have quite easily exposed the addresses of ?úalmost all??Grin users if he had decided to connect to all 3,000 of the system?ôs nodes. In this regard, Bogatyy wrote the following:?úGrin still affords a stronger privacy model than Bitcoin or other non-privacy coins, since amounts are safely encrypted. But Mimblewimble provides a strictly weaker privacy model than Zcash or Monero. This makes it insufficient for many real-world privacy use cases.?ùAs expected, as soon as these developments came to light, the future of Mimblewimble was immediately called into question by people around the globe, who began saying that the privacy protocol could no longer be trusted, since it was clearly not secure enough.¬†However, a few days after the initial report, Daniel Lehnberg, a member of Grin?ôs core developers team, published a blog arguing that the ?úalleged??break-in was confined largely to the protocol?ôs already-acknowledged privacy limitations. He also added that the attack was facilitated through the use of a passive vector that did not have the capacity to acquire any actionable data.Lastly, Grin makes use of a technology called ?úPatient Dandelion,??which is basically a modified version of Bitcoin?ôs Dandelion++ proposal that was outlined in BIP0156. The protocol is commonly used to mask the IP addresses linked with any given transaction because it adds additional stem hops as well as other delays at each node junction. However, since Grin?ôs latest privacy scandal came to light, many experts are now calling into question the overall operational efficacy of Dandelion as well.In its most basic sense, Grin can be thought of as an implementation of the Mimblewimble, or MW, protocol, whose privacy is derived from two key aspects:Additionally, the MW transaction format is substantially different from Bitcoin-like cryptocurrencies, as it allows multiple transactions to be aggregated into a single larger transaction.¬†This aggregation process is ?úlossy,??which essentially means that the protocol hides the size of asset transfers taking place between the involved parties, thus improving the overall scalability of the network. The process of mining blocks with Mimblewimble aggregates all of the associated transactions into a single block, thereby making it difficult for bad actors or any third-party entities to link inputs and outputs when viewing the chain on a historical basis.With so many conflicting details currently floating around on the internet regarding the recent Mimblewimble security lapse, Cointelegraph reached out to Jake Yocom-Piatt, co-founder and project lead for Decred, a community-driven digital currency that uses a hybrid proof-of-work and proof-of-stake consensus model. When asked to comment on Bogatyy?ôs claims and whether he was right or not with his assertions, Yocom-Piatt pointed out:?úDespite an aggressive response from Daniel Lehnberg from Grin, I am of the opinion that Ivan?ôs attack is valid. The attack links inputs and outputs to most MW transactions, and it achieves this by monitoring the Grin network, where it can log transactions prior to their being aggregated either over Dandelion or in a block.?ùHe then added that a few months back, he had published an article in which he too had highlighted the exact same weakness that Bogatyy was able to exploit ??that is, once Grin?ôs native blocks have been mined, participating miners and affiliated nodes have the ability to monitor individual transactions that have been published before they are aggregated.¬†This basically allows a third-party entity (who may be closely monitoring the transactions being published on the network) to potentially make use of the data in order to link transactions that would otherwise not be possible by looking at the information related to other mined blocks. Yocom-Piatt then added:?úIvan executes exactly the attack I described. While Daniel takes exception to Ivan?ôs post for various technical reasons related to terminology, the linking of inputs and outputs is hard to argue against.?ùMany crypto enthusiasts firmly believe that Lehnberg?ôs recent post is a defense tactic. With enough technical know-how, hackers or other third-party entities could easily retrieve a huge volume of the input/output data about the majority of the involved entities, as long as MW-based native transactions can be reliably surveyed before they are aggregated.With that being said, Ethan Fast ??a co-founder of security-oriented crypto exchange Nash ??is of the opinion that Bogatyy?ôs findings are incorrect because of his flawed understanding of how the Mimblewimble protocol works. On the subject, Fast told Cointelegraph:?úHe [Bogatyy] is able to demonstrate that an adversary can construct a transaction graph on the network, in the sense that input A became output B. But because of how the protocol works, this is not like identifying an output address on Bitcoin. Just knowing A=>B does not imply you know who received the funds in any useful sense. So my interpretation is that what Ivan found was already publicly known and he mischaracterized its implications in the article he published.?ùFast then pointed out that a big part of the misunderstanding seems to have stemmed from the confusion surrounding what an ?úaddress??within the Grin ecosystem actually represents. To further solidify his stance, Fast highlighted to Cointelegraph a number of other instances where similar issues over Grin?ôs native operational framework came to light. He further added:?úGrin does not have anything like Bitcoin addresses. In fact, every time you want to send someone an asset, you need to interact with them in a live computation, working together to create a transaction. Given this fact, my understanding is that being able to construct a transaction graph on Grin is not a major security issue, as transactions don?ôt have anything like public addresses that tie them together.?ù¬†Despite Grin?ôs reputation being called into question after the allegations put forth by Bogatyy started to gain widespread attention on the internet over the last week, the platform?ôs core backers (as well as community members) have continued to claim that the assertions put forth by Bogatyy are inherently wrong and that there are many factual inaccuracies ??six, to be exact ??in his findings.¬†Also, it is quite obvious that due to this entire episode, Grin?ôs financial value has taken quite a beating. The currency has dropped from $1.52 to just under $1 over the space of the past seven days.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

""It would be more accurate to describe the Evercoin wallet as a mobile software wallet that is protected by a hardware-based second factor,"" he told Cointelegraph.Matsumura pointed out that Jefferies??definition is a correct stricter use of the term, but asserts that the current implementation goes beyond just an additional authentication factor because the key is being encrypted using on-key APIs rather than just the One-Time-Password features of the YubiKey.Nonetheless, Evercoin 2 contains unique features that are intended to provide enhanced security through easy-to-understand procedures.¬†For instance, if a user loses their private key, they can go into the Evercoin app and show their driver's license to get it back or to receive a new one. This is unlike many exchanges and wallet apps, where losing a private key can mean that crypto is lost forever. However, if a third party is able to retrieve a user?ôs private key, there is the concern that the key may not be fully private anymore.According to blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis, misplacing private keys has resulted in the permanent loss of 2-3 million Bitcoin (BTC). While crypto users are often told to write down their 24-word private key phrase on a piece of paper, it?ôs almost impossible to ensure that this paper will remain safely stored and free from damage.¬†?úThe thing to understand is what happens if you lose the physical hardware device,??noted Matsamura. ?úWe then will need to recover your account using standard account recovery procedures from an Evercoin backup. The standard procedure involves a password to recover, but if you forget that, you can show your ID and recover with that.?ù¬†Matsumura also claims that because the YubiKey 5ci functions intuitively, users can access their crypto in a safe and familiar way. He said:?úThe Evercoin solution works like a hotel key ??¬†you push the key in to your phone to unlock it, and when you pull it out it automatically relocks. It?ôs a simple, known concept to grasp. When you buy a house or a car, you always have ownership of key. You should have the same thing to protect your account of bitcoin, which is what comes out of YubiKey.??¬†In addition, Evercoin 2 users will be able to make use of all of their YukiKey's other functionality, such as securing email and social media accounts. Similarly, existing owners of a YubiKey 5ci can add hardware wallet storage to their existing device by downloading the Evercoin wallet app.While these features make Evercoin unique, hardware wallets are still prone to vulnerabilities that can occur when loading boot code, updating firmware, intercepting chip-to-chip communications and physical attacks.According to Jefferies from CipherTrace, a best practice would be to have any type of hardware wallet certified by an independent lab like UL Labs to ensure that regulatory standards are met. While certification can be expensive, ranging anywhere between $100-200k per device, The Federal Information Protection Standards provides standards for encryption that is required by the U.S. Government.¬†?úI encourage hardware wallet vendors to pursue FIPS 140-3 or FIPS 140-4 to demonstrate that they have properly implemented the encryption in software and designed tamper-proof hardware,"" Jefferies told Cointelegraph. Unfortunately, none have done so just yet.?ùJefferies also noted that the two leading hardware wallets, Ledger and Trezor, have both been hacked and have since been hardened.¬†?úIn lieu of FIPS certification, I would select a hardware wallet that has a bug bounty program and has been available for sale long enough for penetration testers to have time to try to hack it,??said Jefferies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The token allows transactions within Bithumb Chain which enables a plethora of different use-cases. Bithumb Chain is built by first rate esteemed professionals within the IT, security, cryptography and financial verticals.Bithumb Chain is the decentralized open-source protocol that powers the products, services, and infrastructure within the Bithumb Family ecosystem which helps capture value from both upstream and downstream of the trading business. To further bolster the infrastructure of the Bithumb Chain ecosystem, Bithumb Family has a variety of new technologies adding to the value network of the blockchain, including a creative EaaS (Exchange-as-a-Service), which is a unique protocol PSP (Profit Sharing Protocol). The EaaS allows users to access the service through one-click, and adding to this structure to incentivise users is Bithumb Coin (BT).Bithumb Coin (BT) enables transactions within Bithumb Chain and provides the necessary mechanism for facilitating true incentives and value within the protocol. The first principle of the Bithumb Coin (BT) mechanism design is to facilitate the flow of value of the Bithumb Family ecosystem, thereby promoting sustainable development.Token distribution has been described as follows: 30% of the token distribution is based on the user incentive pool, while another 30% is allocated for trading incentives with a point system which will be disclosed at a later time. The other functionality of the coin are as follows: Utility within Bithumb Chain for handling fees, usage rights of the Bithumb chain system and paying the transaction fees of the Bithumb Global platform as well as payment procedures for new products in the future. Through the system lease contract, users can also lease their BT to obtain leasing rewards. Moreover, BT holders can vote and participate in the governance of Bithumb Chain which includes project listing nomination. In effect, Bithumb Chain eco-participants not only participate in the formulation and direction of network development, but also the investment decisions of Bithumb Chain. Examples include BT allowing holders privileges in the platform?ôs marketing activities, including additional raffle tickets to BG Staging and additional rate of return when participating in token staking. Other perks of holding BT includes participating in Bithumb Chain events such as fair token distributions. Bithumb Coin has many perks designed for the holder.25% of the BT?ôs token distribution is based on the chain development and sustainability. The interrelationship of Bithumb Chain to BT can be analogous to how a smart blockchain city would function. Bithumb Chain would represent the city block while various members of the Bithumb Family would represent individual structures within the city and Bithumb Coin (BT) serves as the interconnecting roadway between the different structures within the city block. An example of this in action is as follows: BT holders can stake a choice number of tokens to become a community node of the Bithumb Global platform and regularly participate in Bithumb Family listing nominations. 50% of the platform revenue will also be used for BT buyback until 150 million tokens remain. Bithumb Coin (BT) would facilitate the exchange of value and information across the Bithumb Chain, thereby promoting the sustainable development of all on-chain products, platforms, and services.Bithumb Korea is one of the largest bitcoin exchanges in the world. Its daily trading volume accounts for 75.7% of the bitcoin market in South Korea, accounting for 15% of the global bitcoin market. With Bithumb quickly being the most user-friendly digital asset ecosystem with a rock solid cyber security system and massive liquidity, BT has a bright future ahead for their 8 million Bithumb Family users already participating within the ecosystem.Bithumb Coin?ôs token supply will be scarce with only 300 million tokens minted indefinitely.For further details, please check the Bithumb Global website for the announcement.Bithumb Global is the global arm of Bithumb Korea, which is one of the top exchanges in the world, with a collective transaction volume exceeding 1 trillion US dollars. Bithumb Global is designed to facilitate every global user to trade, participate, or contribute to the digital assets ecosystem with ease.Bithumb Global aims to become a user-friendly digital asset ecosystem with tighter security measures of international standards and increased liquidity.

At the end of September the FSA announced a draft guideline, in which it stated that the composition and sale of investment trusts that invest in cryptocurrencies are ?únot appropriate?? Although the supervisory guideline is not a law, the FSA reportedly intends to restrict excessive funds from flowing into cryptocurrencies, aiming to ?úregulate before commercialization.''Meanwhile, Kenji Fujimaki, a former member of the House of Councilors and economic critic, said that the cryptocurrency industry?ôs call for a change from comprehensive taxation of 55% to separate taxation of 20% is not necessarily delayed.

Using the DCA method means that a customer purchases a fixed dollar amount of a cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin (BTC), no matter what the price happens to be, at a certain date each month. Some claim that the dollar cost averaging method is the best strategy for Bitcoin investment.More than 20 companies including Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, NTT, KDDI and the Mitsubishi Corporation have launched a consortium that aims to raise funds with security tokens.The Mitsubishi UFJ will take the lead in building the platform for trading real estate, corporate bonds and intellectual property as digital securities, while blockchain development company LayerX will provide technical support.The new blockchain-based platform, called Progmat, will handle various financial products. By using smart contracts, it will reportedly be possible to exchange tokens without going through a third party, aiming to automate the transfer of securities rights and settlement of funds.The move is further aimed at developing rules for security tokens following the enforcement of the revised Financial Instruments and Exchange Act next spring.

Ledger, Ethereum, EOS, Tezos, Cardono and others, each with their own ...",08-Nov-19,"A central bank?ôs role is to manage a nation?ôs currency, money supply and interest rates. The United States did not have a central bank until 1913, when Woodrow Wilson signed the Federal Reserve Act into law. Since then, the Federal Reserve has been accountable for the elasticity of the U.S. economy through the expansion and contraction of liquidity in the form of credit and new fiat money supply. Retail and institutional banks abide by the Fed?ôs stringent economic rules, which in turn trickle down to affect the daily lives of entrepreneurs, corporations, investors, markets and the consumer.¬†","Today, the U.S. and most first-world economies are in the precarious position of tightening liquidity as a direct result of overstimulation. It has become commonplace to read about instability in the overnight ?úrepo markets??and leading to the new form of quantitative easing. These are signs that the current financial system is starting to break down again, but unlike 2007, there is an entirely new industry built around the security, liquidity and stability of our money.Market repurchase agreement operations, also known as ?úrepo markets,??have made national major media headlines over the last few months, including from Bloomberg, Financial Times, Business Insider ??just to name a few among the dozens. But what exactly are ?úrepo markets??¬†In short, repo lending is a way for the Fed to expand credit within the banking system. Repo interest rates are the interest rates that banks charge each other for borrowing cash. Typically, they follow the Fed?ôs overnight lending rates. However, we have started to see repo rates spike upward, pointing to an indication of supply issues from banks issuing short-term cash to other banks and an increasing demand from banks and corporations that need short-term cash.¬†In 2007, we saw first-hand that when liquidity dries up, banks fail, markets fall, unemployment grows and economic output contracts. Since then, the Fed has been filling the banking liquidity gap by printing dollars under the name of ?úquantitative easing.??After ten years of providing the markets with easy money, the Fed reversed course in 2018, raising interest rates and selling bonds to clean up their balance sheet. Cutting off the supply of free money combined with raising rates has sent banks scrambling for liquidity, thus jolting the markets several times over the last twelve months.In June, the Fed changed course yet again, ending balance sheet cuts and decreasing interest rates. In September, we got our first glimpse into the consequences of overstimulating the money supply for 10 years then trying to get back to normalization. Although we couldn?ôt see which banks were the culprits, several banks showed their cards as the interbank lending rates rose well above the Fed?ôs set interest rates.¬†In an economy that was backed by free money and debt, a shortage of credit and dollars can quickly escalate into a serious problem. With interest rates already near zero, it is difficult to see what tools the Fed will use when things become dire.For many early crypto enthusiasts, Bitcoin (BTC) offered a new type of money detached from the existing dysfunctional system. Bitcoin arrived 10 years ago in 2009 and presented itself as a new, asymmetric, uncorrelated asset class that was an alternative to mainstream finance. Its value was derived from a global network of distributed contributors collaborating through the mining of new coins while simultaneously securing the network.¬†Throughout the 2010s, the ecosystem evolved beyond just the individual sovereign ownership of money and into the introduction of programmatic intermediaries like smart contracts, which further removed unnecessary human intervention. Bitcoin and Ethereum ??and the new technologies they brought to life ??have demonstrated the beginnings of what international cooperation can look like if we remove superfluous centralized layers in our economic systems that add friction and are quickly proving to be functionally obsolete.¬†¬†There is a necessary balance to strike as we transfer from the flawed financial system of today to the more technological, decentralized system underpinned by blockchain. We?ôve experienced the flaws of pure centralization via ?úquantitative easing,??but to make the assumption that pure decentralization would provide a utopian solution for global finance is a fallacy.¬†Decentralized technologies provide tools to reduce costs and add efficiencies where existing technologies cannot, but there are elements of the existing system including people, corporations and governments that are essential to making the new system work.Bitcoin has led to an entire group of blockchains, including the XRP Ledger, Ethereum, EOS, Tezos, Cardono and others, each with their own specific use cases and governance. One thing that is common between them is an infrastructure for new financial tools to be built around payments, lending, stabilized currencies, tokenization and decentralized exchanges. Two blockchains in particular, Ethereum and the XRP Ledger, have applications being built on top of them that provide tools to lessen the impacts of another global financial crisis.¬†Ethereum could be best defined as a world-wide computer that is formed by an infinite number of computers talking to each other. It offers the advantage of global applications, running exactly how they were programmed and without the risk of tampering by individuals, governments or financial institutions. In an era of endless fiat printing, establishing a reliable, stable currency that people can use in everyday commerce will become pivotal as we begin to witness the effects created by central banks.¬†One project being built on top of Ethereum that is focusing on currency stabilization is the creator of the Dai stablecoin (DAI), MakerDAO ??a type of decentralized autonomous organization managed solely by smart contracts and code rather than human managers. The concept of DAI is fairly straightforward: It?ôs a token like Bitcoin and Ether; however, it?ôs designed to have little to no volatility. To start, DAI is trying to be stable relative to the U.S. dollar ??a big step in the digital world, as most cryptocurrencies are volatile. This paves the way for consumers around the world to transact without concerns of fluctuating value in their currency. Over time, DAI and other stablecoins can diversify in order to hedge against falling fiat currencies and start to peg themselves to fixed assets like gold or other commodities.¬†Creating a stable currency today is already important in places like Argentina, where the national currency depreciated 51% against the U.S. dollar in 2018 alone. When these same effects hit currencies like the U.S. dollar, having a stable consumer currency will become instrumental.In order for digital consumer currencies to work, banks need to transition their infrastructure in order to accommodate this new ecosystem. This will not happen overnight and there will have to be a transition period between the current system and the new one being developed.¬†An example of a company upgrading an entire industry for the benefit of businesses and consumers and positioning themselves perfectly to fill the coming liquidity crisis is Ripple. True to its slogan ???úInstantly move money to all corners of the world????Ripple is a real-time gross settlement system, currency exchange and remittance network.¬†There are many inefficiencies in cross-border transactions between banks today. Slow transactions and high fees are a direct result of the fragmentation that exists between disparate entities. Try to wire a friend or family member money abroad, and you will quickly witness firsthand the frustrations with this outdated technology.It?ôs important to note that the company Ripple is different from the crypto currency XRP ??the digital asset on the XRP ledger. The digital asset and the ledger were formed before the company but do share common founders. Although the company uses XRP for liquidity purposes, they do not control the currency or ledger.¬†Ripple sells RippleNet, an enterprise solution for banks and institutions around the world. RippleNet consolidates the existing community of banks into a single network that provides real-time, liquid and low cost transactions. RippleNet is a payments network based on blockchain technology, with over 200 banks and payment providers worldwide and consisting of three main products: xCurrent, On-Demand Liquidity (formerly xRapid), and xVia; each serving a specific role.xVia provides one method for banks and corporations to send out global payments instantly, while xCurrent provides an instantaneous settlement layer between these banks. On-Demand Liquidity provides the liquid layer between institutions so they can reduce the paper currency they are required to keep on hand. More on this shortly.The repo markets showed the first signs of a liquidity shortage in 2007. As we once again see these signs resurfacing, On-Demand Liquidity could be the solution we didn?ôt have in the late 2000s.¬†Basel III changed the regulatory landscape of how tier 1 capital ratio is calculated. Before the 2007 crisis, regulators could trust that banks had enough liquidity to remain solvent; however, following the financial crisis and failure of several banks like Lehman, that ceased to be the case. The new regulations mandated banks to hold pre-funded accounts, or existing pools of liquidity, to move paper currencies between banks in disparate countries.¬†For example, Bank X in the U.S. and Bank Y in Mexico must now hold a percentage of their deposits in either U.S. dollars or Mexican pesos in order to move currencies between one another. This requirement ties up billions of dollars in working capital and is an inefficient solution to ensure liquidity.¬†xCurrent puts a temporary blockchain between Bank X and Bank Y. When Bank Y wants to receive U.S. dollars from Bank X, rather than Bank X having to hold those dollars on reserve at Bank Y to ensure proper liquidity, they can sell dollars for XRP. The XRP can be sent to Bank Y, who can then sell it in exchange for U.S. dollars. Both banks can maintain full control of their reserves, bringing that working capital back to their individual institution.¬†As we watch for more signs of a global liquidity shortfall, companies like Ripple will be worth keeping a close eye on. The current system is showing its age, but this time, we have new tools to help us avoid the pitfalls of the last crisis while providing the infrastructure for a productive and healthy financial future.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author?ôs alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.Stephen King, a commercial real estate veteran and next generation innovator, is the founder and president of Imbrex, the first property marketplace to syndicate on the Ethereum blockchain.

This follows the company?ôs initial launch of an in-browser Ether (ETH) wallet in 2018. The latest announcement is part of the company?ôs grander plan to make the ?úWeb 3.0??easier to access for the average consumer.","Opera, based in Norway, is the first major browser to develop and integrate a native crypto wallet, which also supports direct transactions. The company started testing the in-browser payment feature in July through a beta version of the Opera for Android browser.Opera?ôs move fits into a larger narrative of companies integrating cryptocurrency into existing systems and networks that people already use. Brave Software Inc., another web browser developer, had first incorporated wallet technology into its browser to allow web users to earn cryptocurrency for performing or permitting certain actions that they already do with traditional browsers without earning anything. Other platforms looking to implement similar Web 3.0 features are also active.Cryptocurrencies are still more popular in the developed world than in developing markets, where most of the world?ôs financially excluded people live. Opera?ôs moves to enable Web 3.0 can potentially bring cryptocurrency to several financially excluded people.¬†That?ôs thanks to the browser?ôs popularity in the developing world, especially Africa. Opera browsers are popular for their data-saving features. The company claimed that data savings in its products helped users in Africa save nearly $100 million in 2018.Therefore, making crypto wallets easily accessible to this group of consumers could be a big step toward using cryptocurrencies to offer financial services to the unbanked and underbanked. In addition to Bitcoin, Ether and Tron, the Opera crypto wallet also supports ERC-20 and TRC-10 tokens. Multiple decentralized financial, or DeFi, products are already being built using certain ERC tokens.Opera?ôs push to expand access to Web 3.0 could also impact the burgeoning betting industry in Africa. The combined size of the gambling market in Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa was worth an estimated $37 billion in 2018.When asked on how Opera?ôs latest developments could potentially help onboard new crypto users through gambling, Tron founder and CEO Justin Sun told Cointelegraph that Wink, a decentralized application built on the Tron blockchain is working now with seamless integration.¬†?úUsers can simply use the Opera browser to play Wink by logging onto Wink.org without using any 3rd party wallets. We expect to see more TRON DApps integrated within Opera in the future, in similar fashion.?ùAccording to Opera, 350 million people use its browsers globally ??nearly 120 million of those are in Africa. It?ôs worth noting, however, that Opera?ôs crypto wallet is only available on the ?úOpera browser with free VPN??application on Android and the ?úOpera Touch??browser on iOS.¬†There isn?ôt any data to tell what portion of the 350 million users use Opera Mini. Still, this means that the crypto wallet is available to fewer than 350 million users. If Opera Mini has the largest user base, then the number of people who can use the Opera crypto wallet could be significantly lower. Opera didn?ôt respond to a request for comment regarding this.Opera isn?ôt the first company to have integrated functionalities for cryptocurrencies into an existing network to foster quicker adoption, as the Brave browser is another web-surfing tool spearheading the crypto charge.¬†Brave was the first to reimagine using browsers as a tool to foster crypto adoption through its privacy-focused Brave browser. The browser gives internet users power over their data by blocking tracking services and ads.¬†Instead, Brave allows users to earn native Basic Attention Token (BAT) when they view advertisements. Users can also use the BAT to reward platforms and content creators of their liking. The browser recently reached 9 million active monthly users.As Opera appears to be targeting the user base that cares about cost-saving for crypto adoption, Brave?ôs target is the privacy-loving customers.In August, Brave went beyond its native wallet that only supports its rewards programs to integrate an Ether wallet that supports ETH as well as most Ethereum tokens and collectibles. Unlike its Brave Rewards system, the Ether wallet doesn?ôt require users to take part in Know Your Customer procedure and can interact with DApps.¬†The browser also allows users to connect a hardware wallet in addition to other layers of protection, according to Brian Bondy, Brave?ôs chief technology officer and co-founder, who told Cointelegraph:¬†?úOur Crypto Wallets feature can be used with hardware wallets (Ledger, Trezor) for users who would like the added security. Additionally, our Crypto Wallet is based on an extension and the background page for that extension has its own process and address space.?ùBrave has made it clear, however, that its wallet is targeted at ?úpeople who already have a working understanding of cryptocurrency generally.??Still, Brave appears interested in using the existing browser network to further the adoption of blockchain and cryptocurrency.?úWe?ôre excited to continue pushing the envelope when it comes to support for cryptocurrency and other blockchain applications on the web platform,??Brave said in its announcement of its crypto wallet.Beyond browsers, different companies are tapping into existing networks and systems to promote the use of cryptocurrencies. In September, Gibraltar-based IOV Labs acquired Spanish-oriented social media platform Taringa, which has 30 million users.¬†IOV Labs, which powers the RSK Bitcoin smart contact platform, sees an opportunity in tapping into data from the social network to build, test and distribute decentralized products based on its smart contract platform and its native RIF token. In the end, it hopes to bring wider adoption to Bitcoin. IOV Labs CEO Diego Guti√©rrez Zald√≠var told Cointelegraph that:?úLatin America, a market already in need of financial services as half of the population is unbanked. The values inherent in the development of Bitcoin, blockchain and Taringa are one and the same, empowering individuals by giving them a voice and the economic tools they need to thrive.?ùIOV Labs plans to incentivize Taringa users to participate meaningfully in the communities hosted on the social network by rewarding them with RIF tokens. Zald√≠var added that:?úWe know blockchain technology can meet the existing needs of these users far more effectively than existing systems, by protecting user privacy, and sharing the economic value and reputation users create with their interactions.?ùIn 2017, Aptoide started developing AppCoins, an open-source and distributed protocol for app stores based on the Ethereum blockchain. It raised over $16.8 million in an initial coin offering for AppCoins??development. For Aptoide, which claimed to have more than 200 million users, integrating a blockchain-based system was a natural step, owing to its community-oriented approach to app distribution.Aptoide?ôs chief operating officer and creator, √Ålvaro Pinto, told Cointelegraph that Aptoide has been a community-driven app store since inception. With Aptoide, users can create their own list of apps, which can be shared with family, friends and colleagues to foster deeper app engagement.Part of Aptoide?ôs aim is to make in-app payment simpler in emerging markets, where it has the majority of its users. In these countries, it can be difficult for users to make in-app purchases because one can only buy them using a credit card, PayPal and gift cards as Pinto explained:?úWe have this huge amount of people using smartphones, but if you look into the number, the number of users doing in-app purchases and buying digital goods in the app stores is very limited.?ù¬†However, Pinto is adamant that the problem isn?ôt affordability. He believes that many people can afford to make 50-cent purchases, but the process for making such purchases is difficult. Pinto added:?úWe?ôre starting to see the common user having their first experience with blockchain, and that was part of the idea ??to take blockchain to the average user and to all this gigantic user base of Android.??

alternative full-node Bitcoin implementation written in go, whose source ...",19-Nov-19,"The topic of decentralized autonomous organizations is echoing loud and clear from the halls of this year?ôs DevCon to CryptoTwitter. Multiple projects at DevCon, including Aragon and MolochDAO, presented their commitments to decentralize power across a DAO, or, a group organized by rules encoded as a computer program. DAOs are transparent and controlled by the community rather than a centralized authority, such as a government, bank or corporation.¬†","Related: What is DAOKey to the formation of a DAO is the organization around a particular purpose or mission. For example, Aragon is organized to enable new types of sovereign organizations. MolochDAO exists to fund Ethereum infrastructure. The mission of the Decred DAO is to enable direct sovereignty over the protocol, which is built to be a sustainable and long-term store of value.¬†Based on my experience, I?ôd like to share four lessons in DAO de-leadership, which correspond with the four aspects required to realize the purpose of a successful DAO: 1) humble leadership that writes itself out as the project grows; 2) funding free from special interests; 3) active development; and 4) strong community participation in decision-making.¬†Leaders need to drop their egos and edge themselves out.¬†Egos are dangerous when you?ôre trying to decentralize, as they tend to cling to their own importance and power. However, a leader must be able to let go, and over time, relinquish all control to the DAO. For example, we?ôre currently decentralizing control of the treasury, and the community already votes to determine the budget allocation process. Too many founders overstay their authority or create a small group of decision-makers that maintain centralized control ??yet another central planning committee. Even respected projects like MakerDAO struggle to put power directly in the hands of the community. It?ôs an ongoing exercise in trusting the collective intelligence of the community rather than looking to a founder, expert or oracle. Without the relinquishment of power, the DAO remains centralized and there is no certainty it persists beyond the life of the founder.You need developer and project funding.Right now, project funding typically comes from corporate entities, i.e., venture capital, foundations, ICOs or similar, and even individuals who deposit funds in exchange for voting power. With funding typically coming from legacy financial systems, new methods are required to ensure sustainable funding in these uncharted waters. No infrastructure exists, we have no models to emulate, so DAOs must forge the path, overcome roadblocks and find creative solutions. The establishment is not going down without a fight, as we?ôre seeing with Facebook?ôs Libra, but resistance is futile. Decentralization is already happening.¬†MolochDAO is an example of a benefactor model for funding Ethereum developers. Whether or not this will stand the test of time is still to be determined. Community funding initiatives are a way to avoid venture capitals who need a return on their investment. DAOs are becoming a new way for community members to back a project, although VCs can participate as well. With Decred, we have a continuously self-funding treasury derived from 10% of each block reward, which is used for project-level expenses.¬†In the long-term, broader solutions make more sense because they are sustainable. Decentralizing a treasury, adding privacy, or creating a decentralized exchange all contribute toward the long-term health of the project. None of these initiatives yield immediate payouts, and none of them would likely be funded if the source of funding needed to realize short term gains. These projects define the long-term direction of both the DAO and the broader ecosystem they wish to build. The return on these infrastructure investments is on a decades-long horizon, and for those who are patient, it will yield immeasurable value.A successful DAO is like a smooth-running machine, but will still hit some bumps.The technical commitment required to build a successful DAO is monumental. Too many projects talk about developing new features or upgrades, but in reality they lack a holistic game plan to recruit and retain the right development talent. Ethereum, for example, is a massive base layer to decentralized finance and decentralized apps, but its long development delays mean other projects built on top of it are also in a holding pattern waiting for results. On its blog last year, Aragon said, ?úMaking organizations upgradeable is key, so they can last as long as the Ethereum blockchain is up (or even beyond Ethereum).??To do so, agile and adaptable development are needed. If a project?ôs base layer has issues, it can create serious problems, like Ethereum?ôs base layer changes that caused problems for Aragon smart contracts.¬†Rather than trying to steer a slow-moving ship, DAOs need to give individual contributors the autonomy to move fast. Decred employs independent contractors to develop features so they are often able to move faster on the projects that most interest them. For example, one team of agile developers created our first mobile wallet app, while another group passionate about security developed our initial privacy release a few months back.Actions speak louder than words.A DAO?ôs participants will become disenfranchised without sovereignty distributed amongst them. We see this all the time in politics as apathy sets in when voters don?ôt believe their voice matters. Members of a DAO must have real efficacy, not just the ability to comment on decisions, or worse ??having no platform to engage at all. The more participation in decision-making or voting, the fairer the outcome and the healthier the DAO will be.When it comes to voting in a DAO, there are two ways: votes can be direct or delegated. Delegated voting is no different than representative democracy, where a select group could easily act in their short-term or personal interests over the long-term benefits of the entire community. Take EOS for example: This year alone, millions of dollars in profit are heading to a select group of block producers who also control much of the delegated voting, self-electing without any actual regard to their behavior or merit. This isn?ôt the way a DAO should function, and it?ôs antithetical to the health of the network.Direct participation ensures that all parties are designing a future that works long-term. Direct voting means individuals have hard sovereignty and must live with the consequences of their decisions, while delegated systems mean DAO members aren?ôt truly vested. Instead, they're simply staking in hopes of making money. In Decred?ôs Politeia, a blockchain-anchored project management proposal system, individuals have a real voice. Not only do they publicly debate proposals, but their votes determine whether or not the proposals are implemented. In its first year, Politeia?ôs mean voter participation was 31.2%, with its highest voter turnout representing a majority of the community at 51.7% voted. Thus far, no proposal has failed to hit 20% quorum. This is direct sovereignty in action. It works to engage voters, it?ôs the most fair, and the most decentralized.In the end, creating a DAO means pioneering uncharted territory. But we?ôre all in this together, and the best way forward is to align the motivations and incentives of the different parties that participate in the DAO.

He maintains that he believed the scheme was legal.Neil Bush, a businessman, had been interviewed by the FBI due to his role as a board member of Hoifu Energy, which is owned by wealthy Chinese businessman Dr. Hui Chi Ming.¬†One of Dr. Ming?ôs companies is alleged to have pursued a $60 million loan to buy an African oil field and Scott?ôs counsel has subsequently argued that Bush?ôs indirect involvement with the deal contributed to Scott?ôs feeling confident enough to transact with those behind it.The oil field deal was to be financed in cash and ""a very large portion of the purchase price"" in OneCoin. Details of the FBI?ôs interview with Bush were heard at the trial, with Garvin stating:?úBush recalled that the head of Hoifu Energy, Dr. Hui Chi Ming, received a bunch of cryptocurrency for an oil deal in Madagascar. Bush had a residual interest in the cryptocurrency from the oil deal.

The judge further concurred that Bush?ôs testimony would not add anything further to what was already included in the FBI?ôs report.¬†As reported, Ignatov testified on Nov. 6 that after his sister fled, the security personnel who accompanied her told him that she had met with Russian speakers.

Crypto Market Trading ??Inside Look ...",22-Nov-19,A company providing cloud-based crypto trading software that enables transactions to be completed automatically has unveiled support for another crypto exchange.,"TradeSanta says its users can now connect to their Huobi accounts. The exchange is one of the world?ôs biggest in terms of trading volume ??and reportedly serves 5 million clients in 130 countries, including the United States.Other leading exchanges including Binance, HitBTC, Bittrex, Upbit and Bitfinex are also supported by TradeSanta ??with the likes of BitMEX and OKEx set to be added in the not-too-distant future.According to¬†TradeSanta, there has been growing interest in its automation tools since the service launched back in November 2018. The software specializes in helping traders execute their strategies immediately and without the need for constant supervision.The company claims there are several advantages for traders who rely on automation. Firstly, orders can be placed up to 100 times faster than what would be possible if they were doing so manually. These tools can also remove emotion from trading decisions, enabling users to think about their strategies ahead of time and refrain from making impulsive orders that could cause them to lose more money. Last but not least, TradeSanta says its aim is to ensure that its community no longer needs to be constantly tethered to their PC or mobile at all times. With cryptocurrency markets remaining active 24 hours a day, seven days a week, automation provides an opportunity for traders to take a step back and tend to their other business interests, enjoy leisure time with loved ones or catch up on some much-needed sleep.TradeSanta says one of its main priorities has been ensuring that its software is easy for traders of all experience levels to use. Multiple tutorials are available so crypto enthusiasts can develop new skills and make the most of the program?ôs features, and an intuitive dashboard means that monitoring the performance of a bot is simple. These transparent analytics are also accompanied by handy Telegram notifications that alert traders whenever there have been significant market movements.¬†In order to make the most of the vast array of cryptocurrencies on offer, traders these days normally have to go through the arduous process of registering with multiple exchanges. Although remembering all of these usernames and passwords can be difficult enough, mastering each and every interface can be nothing short of a nightmare. Using a TradeSanta trading bot helps to alleviate this problem by delivering a uniform interface and connecting to each of these exchanges through the use of API keys.TradeSanta claims that a new bot can be created in under five minutes by using one of its preset templates ??and, as an alternative, seasoned traders can lovingly develop a customized strategy from scratch if they prefer. At the time of writing, the software boasted more than 17,800 active users and in excess of 5,000 trading bots, with 933,000 deals completed in total. Bots are effortlessly divided into active and inactive subsections, and the TradeSanta app provides an at-a-glance look as to whether bots are working successfully or need attention owing to an error.Four subscription tiers are available ??including a free account that gives users up to two bots, an unlimited number of pairs, access to all trading strategies, Telegram notifications and on-demand support from customer services. Paid plans increase the number of bots that a trader can use simultaneously. The most expensive subscription, at $100 a month, provides an unlimited number of bots ??with the added benefit of zero trading fees on the HitBTC exchange.Disclaimer.

Bitcoin developer, had been hired to work for OneCoin at one point.",10-Nov-19,"With each passing day, the financial nitty-gritty associated with the cryptocurrency-related OneCoin Ponzi scheme continues to become of increasing interest to members of the global crypto community.¬†","The U.S. government?ôs previous estimate of the scam that raked in a total of $4 billion seems to be well off the mark, as the figure could be more than three to four times the official estimate ??this is according to Jamie Bartlett, the person responsible for the BBC's podcast series The Missing Cryptoqueen.¬†As part of the show, Bartlett and his team followed a trail of clues to track down Ruja Ignatova, who is widely credited as being the mastermind behind the entire OneCoin scam. Bartlett also uncovered a host of shocking documents during his research that revealed that OneCoin may have gathered more than $4 billion from just a single continent alone.To put things into context, it appears as though over the course of the fourth quarter of 2014 and the third quarter of 2016, OneCoin was able to generate a total of 3.4 billion euros (approximately $3.8 billion). However, since the coins had no intrinsic value attached to them, they could not be used to facilitate any real-world deals or purchases.¬†Instead, the scheme relied solely on heavy marketing tactics and other nefarious ploys ??such as Ignatov claiming that OneCoin Ltd. had successfully attracted more than three million members across the globe. However, at its core, the project was no different from any other multilevel marketing scheme, simply because, much like other MLM schemes, OneCoin too doled out handsome commissions to its members for on-boarding new recruits.¬†Fast forward to 2019 and the aforementioned scam is currently being tried in front of a court of law. The prosecutors allege that Mark Scott, a U.S.-based attorney who had previously worked for reputed law firm Locke Lord LLP, helped Ignatov launder the bulk of the proceeds acquired through the OneCoin scam.¬†Scott, who has pleaded not guilty, is being accused of employing a wide network of fake companies, offshore bank accounts and fraudulent investment schemes to siphon off more than $400 million in illegal proceeds. As compensation for his shady activities, prosecutor Julieta Lozano pointed out that Scott was paid handsomely in the form of a 57-foot yacht, three multimillion-dollar homes in Cape Cod, Massachusetts and luxury cars, including three Porsches and a Ferrari.¬†To better understand the ongoing situation and how its potential outcome will pan out, Cointelegraph reached out to Matthew Russell Lee, founder of Inner City Press, which is known for its investigative journalism related to the global finance industry. Lee has been following the situation closely and has attended all of the recent hearings concerning OneCoin and the U.S. vs. Scott trial.¬†When asked about Scott and his claim that he duly informed the FBI about his efforts to determine whether OneCoin might be a pyramid scheme before he got involved with the project, Lee replied:?úMark Scott's defense is that he didn't know that OneCoin, for example, had no blockchain. But his claims of not knowing that something was wrong are undercut by evidence he would only speak with Ruja Ignatova on a ?òcrypto-phone??and in some cases, only in person. Scott traveled to Sophia and, according to cooperating witness Konstantin Ignatov (Ruja's brother and, until her abrupt disappearance, personal assistant), met with Ruja with nearly all other OneCoin staff told to go home for the day not witness or overhead anything.?ùOn the subject of Ruja Ignatov?ôs current whereabouts and how she has been able to evade various law enforcement agencies for so long, Lee told Cointelegraph an intriguing detail: Konstantin Ignatov testified on Nov. 6 that after his sister fled, security personnel who accompanied her told him that she had met with people who spoke Russian. Konstantin Ignatov also added that his sister informed him that she had the support and protection of a ""rich and powerful"" Russian individual.Despite all this information now being out in the public domain, the OneCoin project continues to remain fully operational. Even the project?ôs parent company, OneLife, continues to reiterate the mantra that ""OneCoin verifiably fulfills all criteria of the definition of a crypto-currency.""¬†To make sense of this, Cointelegraph reached out to a Singapore-based crypto executive who claims to have inside knowledge on the matter but wishes to remain anonymous due to privacy concerns. According to the executive:?úOneCoin has at various times, attempted to involve legitimate community players in creating a functioning blockchain for optics.?ùThe executive also claimed that a lot of the market hype that OneCoin generated upon its release had crossed over to the Singapore scene and that Marcelo Carsil of Macenas, as well as an early Bitcoin developer, had been hired to work for OneCoin at one point.Lastly, Lee believes that the company?ôs ongoing operations are just a smokescreen to make it seem as though the project is still going ahead, as laid out in the original roadmap. He further highlighted that the mother of Ruja and Konstantin Ignatov still works at the OneCoin office in Sophia, Bulgaria. However, Lee expressed his doubts about OneCoin, saying, ?úI cannot imagine, given the evidence, how much longer this can continue.?ùEven though Scott is currently being tried in court in relation to a sizeable sum of $400 million, the larger question still remains: What happened to the rest of the money? It seems as though there has been little to no accountability as far as the entire score goes, but Lee believes that Ruja Ignatov ??and perhaps her sponsors ??took a lot of it.¬†Additionally, he pointed out that as per a recent testimony, a man in the United Arab Emirates named Amer Abdulaziz, who is still free and makes routine public appearances, took around $100 million from the total stash. Lee concluded by saying:?úI am particularly interested in the alleged money launderer(s) who were named in testimony on November 6, and other professional enablers some of whom have gone on to work on other crypto-currency projects.??

Since Bitcoin?ôs rise to mainstream prominence in 2015, there has been increasing recognition of digital assets from government agencies around the world. In turn, new regulations are being imposed to control the way cryptocurrency companies operate and do business globally.¬†","Most recently, the Financial Action Task Force issued new guidelines on how digital assets should be regulated. In order to raise awareness around these requirements, the blockchain security company CipherTrace hosted a conference and hackathon this week in San Francisco dedicated entirely to discussions on the FATF guidelines, also known as the ?útravel rule.?ùThe travel rule requires regulators and Virtual Asset Service Providers, such as exchanges from various countries worldwide, to collect and share personal data during transactions. Much like the guidelines followed by traditional banks under the United States Bank Secrecy Act, the travel rule being enforced for crypto firms follow the same requirements as money transmitters do to record identifying information on all parties in fund transfers made between financial institutions.Yet, unlike traditional financial firms, many cryptocurrency exchanges do not capture personally identifiable information by default. Complying with the travel rule will therefore require significant shifts for businesses operating in the crypto space.?úThe new regulations coming from FATF will ultimately change the way crypto companies operate, requiring them to track not only their own customers??transactions, but also where their customers are sending money to,??Dave Jevans, CEO of CipherTrace, told Cointelegraph.One of the main goals of the CipherTrace conference was to gather regulators, banks, crypto companies and programmers together to make sense of the new guidelines, and then build a solution that would allow organizations to easily comply with the FATF rules.?úThere are broad implications around privacy, identification of customers, how data works across various blockchains and privacy coins,??said Jevans. ?úWe need to come up with solutions to ensure that companies can easily comply with these regulations, which is what we aim to achieve here.?ùPrior to working on a compliance solution at the hackathon, a number of panels highlighted the themes and main challenges surrounding the FATF regulations. While these rules are not yet legally binding ??as the FATF said in a public statement in June that countries have until June 2020 to adopt the guidelines ??a broad theme at the CipherTrace conference was that action must be taken immediately. The¬†G-20¬†stated that it already uses the recommendations for anti-money laundering regulation of cryptocurrencies, so crypto companies that fail to comply with the new regulations are likely to face penalties.?úThe consequences for non-compliance could range from a slap on the wrist, to going to jail if a company violates the Bank Secrecy Act,??Carol Van Cleef, CEO of blockchain consulting firm Luminous Group, warned on stage during the legal requirements panel. ?úNo matter how big or small a company is, each has obligations to fulfil under the law.?ùAlthough this may be the case, John Jefferies, CipherTrace?ôs chief financial analyst, pointed out that many companies operating in the cryptocurrency sphere have yet to comply with the new regulations.?úMany U.S. exchanges may not yet be compliant, but they should be at this time,??Jefferies said. ?úMoving forward, when Binance or Coinbase completes a transaction for example, they need to send the sender recipient data at the same time with that transaction. Otherwise, they are not in compliance.?ùWhile most crypto companies are not yet compliant with the FATF regulations, Jevans, the CEO of CipherTrace, stressed the importance of getting everyone on the same page.?úEducation is the main challenge we have to tackle first,??he said. ?úWe need to know what the FATF laws are, why we should care and what can happen if companies don?ôt comply.?ùThe U.S. Treasury Department?ôs¬†Financial Crimes Enforcement Network emerging technology policy specialist, Carole House, explained the FATF guidelines during her keynote. She highlighted that the guidelines are designed to curb the use of cryptocurrencies for financial crimes by making crypto transactions more traceable, giving regulators increased visibility into both cross-border and domestic currency transfers.?úCrypto companies need to comply with the virtual currency recommendations by the end of June 2020. We?ôve already been involved with a number of people from the Digital Commerce Association to provide commentary around accomplishing this,??House stated.As the FATF regulations were brought to light, a number of challenges around ensuring compliance followed.For instance, the question of how the FATF guidelines would relate to privacy coins was a pressing issue. One of the stated goals of privacy coins such as Monero and Zcash is to ensure that users have anonymized transactions, so it is questionable how these could be compliant with the new regulations.During the privacy coin panel, Jack Gavigan, head of product and regulatory affairs at Zcash, asked, ?úIs compliance possible in relation to privacy coins??ùAnswering his own question, Gavigan stated his belief that compliance is indeed possible, as a number of privacy coins are already listed in U.S. exchanges regulated by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network.Even though this may be the case, understanding how to abide by the FATF regulations in a way that focuses on privacy while maintaining the decentralized ethos of cryptocurrency and blockchain remains a challenge.Jake Tarnow, a security software developer at CipherTrace, aimed to solve this problem during the hackathon. His team came up with an impressive solution that aims to keep data anonymous when information is being exchanged between Virtual Asset Service Providers.?úIf VASP A is trying to send data to VASP B, we need to know how this can be done in a way that none of the information is in the clear,??Tarnow told Cointelegraph.His solution entailed using a zk-SNARK ??short for a ?úzero-knowledge succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge????a form of cryptography that allows one party to securely reveal that it possesses a piece of information, without actually exposing the information itself.?úBy using zk-SNARKs, VASPs can send this information in a bulletproof way, where no one else can pick that up and pull out their proprietary information,??explained Tarnow.During the hackathon, developers also worked closely with security software gurus to integrate the Travel Rule Information Sharing Architecture into their systems. CipherTrace announced the release of TRISA in September as an open-source, peer-to-peer design for cryptocurrency companies and blockchain projects to comply with the FATF regulations.TRISA is meant to provide secure, reliable delivery of personally identifiable information, or PII, to the correct VASP, eliminating a huge risk for exchanges. However, sharing PII is prone to spamming, a problem that developers at the CipherTrace hackathon aimed to solve.?úVarious backend systems managing PII are vulnerable to spamming, as spammers can get into these systems and start asking people to send PII,??explained Jefferies.Independent consultant Kenneth Kron and his team won first place in the hackathon for coming up with a solution that introduces PII tokens to prevent spamming in TRISA.?úWe want to solve the problem of PII spamming in TRISA by introducing PII tokens and KYC providers who can generate enhanced KYC tokens. If spammers are trying to capture personal information and get a hit, all they get back is a token in this case,??Kron told Cointelegraph.Overall, the CipherTrace conference and hackathon gathered a unique mix of individuals to discuss the future of cryptocurrency regulations. The discussions throughout the event demonstrated that action must be taken now to ensure that crypto companies are compliant with the FATF regulations by June 2020.?úWe gathered many tribes that do not typically interact, enabling experts from government, exchanges and privacy groups to understand each other?ôs diverse perspectives,??Jefferies told Cointelegraph after the conference. ?úThe conversations instilled a sense of urgency in the community and TRISA, while creating an open-source path to meet these tight regulatory deadlines and defend privacy at the same time.??

that supported Bitcoin. As the first mover among blockchain ...",12-Nov-19,Blockchain development communities cultivate the healthy growth of an open-source software platform.,"?úIt takes a village to raise a child,??is a popular saying that emphasizes the role of a larger group to properly nurture and develop the youngest members of society.The same holds true for young businesses. Without the endorsement of its 16 million-plus backers, Kickstarter projects would not come to fruition. Twitter would surely not have evolved into one of the world?ôs most well-known social networking platforms without adoption from 330 million monthly active users.Community supporters are the lifeblood of emerging companies. So, it?ôs critical for companies to know how to respond to, and interact with, their communities. Whether made up of consumers, users or developers, brand advocates should be prioritized, engaged with, and listened to. For young businesses juggling many priorities, this can be a challenge.A defining quality of any endeavor?ôs success can often be measured in terms of support. Whether it is the capital of pioneers who first forged into an industry or the consumer adoption of a new good or service in the marketplace, without support, it would often not be possible for the ecosystem to grow beyond early adopters. As this applies to open-source blockchain products, the support of developers often represents the difference between success and mass adoption, and failure and obscurity.For the major role they play, blockchain developers are a sought-after commodity. Hired?ôs State of Software Engineers Report for 2019 shows a year-over-year 517% rise in global demand for blockchain engineers. The blockchain industry?ôs growth stems from this community?ôs diligence to test new releases and provide feedback. For up-and-coming enterprises, collaboration with developers has led to rapid growth for software and quick newcomer adoption.¬†The blockchain industry owes its beginnings to a community of developers that supported¬† Bitcoin. As the first mover among blockchain technology platforms, Bitcoin?ôs proof-of-work and encryption mechanism laid the underpinnings from which many other open-source blockchain platforms would follow. A community of minds working together made this momentum possible, and the growing support of a diverse number of developers has resulted in a more thoroughly tested ??and thereby robust ??code base.As it expanded from a handful of developers running nodes scattered across the internet, blockchain technology blossomed into a more decentralized network of validators. Although it stemmed from relatively humble beginnings, there are now at least 9,493 reachable nodes in the Bitcoin network. The growing diversity of the teams working on the network?ôs infrastructure enriched the community. Open-source code made it possible for anyone to branch off and develop their own solutions. From this creative sandbox, other networks emerged, giving rise to an ecosystem of blockchain applications. Some examples of this can be seen with the launch of Ethereum in 2015 as well as that of EOSIO in 2018.Like any other constituent, the developer community needs to be nurtured and engaged with for long-lasting benefits. These might include the establishment of a dedicated ?údeveloper relations??team that engages with the developer community through events, developer resources and training materials.Developers thrive when they have access to the latest tools, educational frameworks and reference examples that improve the learning experience to continue building on blockchain software. In turn, developer feedback is taken into consideration by the core teams who engineer many of the open-source protocols that make blockchain applications work. This feedback becomes an outlet for community input on how platforms evolve to meet the needs of a rapidly growing user base. The results of this back-and-forth are often reflected in the open-source Github repositories behind various projects.The Bitcoin Core Github repository offers a solid example of how community support ultimately stimulates growth. As the code base grew, a lack of formality in the coding style led to inconsistencies. To better manage input from a growing number of engineers, development guidelines were published that allowed for a more efficiently coordinated effort. This move simultaneously strengthened the community and Bitcoin Core?ôs code repository during a phase of growth.When open-source development communities have access to vast libraries of tools that simplify the building process, it makes it possible to more rapidly deploy projects. For Ethereum developers, a long list of open-source tools has been published to help developers get started. With numerous resources at their disposal, engineers have an easier time making their creative visions a reality.¬†One example from my company, Block.one, is the release of a Contract Development Toolkit complete with a set of utilities designed to aid EOSIO developers as they build smart contracts. The toolkit lets developers process and compile C++ code to WASM binary code to be executed on the blockchain. It also contains a more advanced set of tools to customize smart contracts to meet maximum performance and efficiency criteria.Today?ôs blockchain development community spans multiple platforms. By tapping the collective community wisdom, software companies could solve some of the thorniest tech issues. When software architects offer their support, it becomes possible to harness the potential of a robust developer ecosystem. Building connections with communities at the start may yield global inputs to bring creative answers.Serg Metelin is the head of developer relations at Block.one. Originally from Ukraine, he was one of the early pioneers of social media applications for Eastern European social network VK.com. After moving to Australia in 2009, Serg worked with digital and marketing agencies and consultancies, delivering solutions for large Australian and international brands such as Disney, Electronic Arts, Woolworths and others.

The report indicated that police had restrained an additional $472,000 in cryptocurrency and $377,000 in banked funds from an associate in November.The CPRA is a civil-based process where a high court judge must decide whether someone has accumulated wealth and benefits through significant criminal activity. If this is found to be the case, the judge can grant the order to freeze and confiscate any assets in relation to the alleged criminal activities.In this case, New Zealand police suspect that the Hamilton-based McIvor is involved in money laundering, as he received millions of dollars from an illegal movie-streaming website he helped to create.Detective Senior Sergeant Keith Kay, the head of the Asset Recovery Unit in the Waikato, said his team became involved after a tip from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS), which had received suspicious activity reports from PayPal, which led tax officials to McIvor in New Zealand.The police reported told the New Zealand Herald that McIvor obtained roughly $2 million from the streaming site, which was allegedly deposited into his bank accounts from international wire transfers, PayPal, and Stripe. Kay further commented:""Introducing illicitly-obtained funds into New Zealand constitutes money laundering and police will thoroughly investigate and restrain the assets of those who undertake such activity [...] regardless of where in the world the crime is committed.""McIvor?ôs lawyer, Hamilton barrister Truc Tran, said that his client is denying the allegations of money laundering.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He added that the IRS wanted to obtain records that could compromise his financial and personal security if lost by the government.However, the IRS was not impressed and said in a filing that the Washington resident was unable to show any reason why the summons should not be enforced. The IRS also laughed off Zietzke?ôs vague allegations, where he insinuated that the tax agency is developing a database, so they can track anyone who owns virtual currency accounts. In the filing, the agency wrote:?úRather than allow the IRS to summon the information it needs from Coinbase, Mr. Zietzke invents an IRS surveillance conspiracy and argues that the IRS has all the relevant information it needs to determine whether he is entitled to the refund he claims ??that is the limited, sometimes redacted, and ever changing information he has provided.?ùThe IRS added:?úBy the summons at issue, the IRS seeks information to do exactly what Congress charged it to do: make an accurate determination of Mr. Zietzke's tax liability.?ùThe IRS further explained that records beyond 2016 were necessary to determine his tax liability because Zietzke claimed a refund based on transactions involving Bitcoin (BTC) he obtained in 2011.In November, the Democratic 2020 presidential candidate Andrew Yang promised to promote legislation on the crypto asset market space by defining what a token is, when a token is a security, and equally important, clarify the tax implications of owning, selling, and trading digital assets, among others.Back in June, the U.S. Congressman (R-N.C.)

We also believe its role in restoring fungibility to bitcoin will be vital.?ùIn a presentation to investors published on Nov. 20, Cypherpunk pointed out a number of its other recent investments, which included a $100,000 contribution to privacy-centric Bitcoin (BTC) wallet Samourai Wallet, a $300,000 investment into decentralized open source blockchain project Chia, and Swedish Hydro66 datacenter, providing services to cloud providers and cryptocurrency miners.As blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis reported in late August, Wasabi Wallet had mixed a total of $250 million in Bitcoin in 2019, seeing a significant rise in volume since January. The firm indicated that the majority of funds sent to cryptocurrency mixing services or tumblers were primarily used for privacy purposes rather than for illicit activities.In July, the official Samourai Wallet Telegram account raised concerns over an alleged lack of privacy ensured by the CoinJoin implementation of competing wallet Wasabi. According to Samourai Wallet, Wasabi wallet CoinJoin transactions are often not as private as they are purported to be. The company pointed out:?úWith Wasabi if you are mixing 10 BTC, I can trivially track that 10 BTC as it is peeled down into smaller UTXOS (unspent funds). [...] Additionally Wasabi outputs are in the order in which they are registered, allowing you to make educated guesses that cluster outputs that you can later cross reference when inputs are inevitably merged to make a spend.??

its General Fund, sparking a bizarre rumor that the generous soul ...",19-Nov-19,The developers of privacy-centric cryptocurrency Grin (GRIN) have hit back at the fundamental claims of an article purporting to have ?úbroken??the coin?ôs privacy model.,"In a Medium blog post published on Nov. 19, Grin core dev Daniel Lehnberg argued that the so-called breakage did not go beyond the already-acknowledged privacy limitations of the coin?ôs protocol and relied on a passive attack vector that would be insufficient to glean actionable data.Lehnberg?ôs post does not consist of a point-by-point takedown of the original article, which was published yesterday by Ivan Bogatyy, a researcher at United States-based Dragonfly Capital Partners.¬†Instead, it targets what it deems to be the purportedly unsubstantiated logical leaps and factual inaccuracies used by Bogatyy to corroborate his claim.¬†As previously reported, Grin?ôs protocol ?úMimblewimble??is a variant of the cryptographic protocol known as Confidential Transactions, which uses cryptographic primitives known as ?úPedersen commitments.?ù¬†These obfuscate sensitive transaction data rather than showing plaintext transaction values and can, therefore, prevent double-spending while improving privacy. They allow for the use of basic arithmetic using public parameters to validate transactions, while the correspondent transaction input and output values remain unknown variables.The protocol notably does not use wallet addresses or public keys, only inputs and outputs. Because of this, each sender must contact a receiver via a private channel in order to construct a transaction.As outlined in Cointelegraph?ôs coverage yesterday, Bogatyy had focused on the use of a default, supplemental feature to MimbleWimble called CoinJoin, which creates small ?úanonymity sets??by combining encrypted inputs into a single large transaction in such a way as to make it is difficult to distinguish which inputs are paying which outputs.¬†Bogatyy also claimed to have conducted a successful ?úattack??on a supplemental feature called ?úDandelion??that is used by Grin to reduce the chance of so-called ?úspy nodes??recording transactions before cut-through, while they are still in an unconfirmed transaction pool (or ?úmempool??.¬†While the limitations of Grin?ôs overall privacy model ??which is significantly more complex than space permits to outline here ??are known, Lehnberg?ôs critique of Bogatyy?ôs research rests on what he judges to be key ?úinconsistencies.?ùThese include the implication that it would be possible for law enforcement to link intercepted data to a user address ??when, as Lehnberg states, addresses do not exist within Grin?ôs privacy model at all. He adds:¬†?úWe have to assume that the author conveniently confused transaction outputs (TXOs) with addresses, but these are not the same. And, as we?ôve already detailed, the fact that TXOs can be linked is hardly news.?ùLehnberg?ôs critique of Bogatyy?ôs claims continues to address several further points, with his central line of argument ??details aside ??resting on the statement that:?úThe Grin team has consistently acknowledged that Grin?ôs privacy is far from perfect. While transaction linkability is a limitation that we?ôre looking to mitigate as part of our goal of ever-improving privacy, it does not ?òbreak??Mimblewimble nor is it anywhere close to being so fundamental as to render it or Grin?ôs privacy features useless.?ùAs reported, Grin underwent its first network hard-fork this summer to introduce tweaks to its consensus algorithm in order to achieve greater resistance to ASIC miners.In October, the Litecoin Foundation published two new draft proposals that pave the way toward integrating MimbleWimble in order to establish privacy features for the Litecoin (LTC) network.Earlier this month, Grin received an anonymous 50 Bitcoin (BTC) donation to its General Fund, sparking a bizarre rumor that the generous soul behind it was Satoshi.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on this data, the contract then makes mutual payments to the parties to settle the deal automatically.Sberbank notes that its solution covers the repo lifecycle end-to-end, which it claims eliminates counterparty risk and, in doing so, could translate into more affordable financing.Sberbank has actively pursued blockchain development in various aspects of its business but has stopped short of offering cryptocurrency-related services.In May 2019, Cointelegraph reported that the bank had halted its potential cryptocurrency trading plans because the Central Bank of Russia is still largely opposed to the adoption of the crypto space.

According to an expert at blockchain research firm Dragonfly Research, Mimblewimble's privacy is fundamentally flawed, which he reportedly proved by discovering the exact addresses of senders and recipients for 96% transactions of Mimblewimble?ôs privacy-centric coin Grin (GRIN).","Ivan Bogatyy, a researcher at United States-based Dragonfly Capital Partners, published a Medium post on Nov. 18 in which he claimed that he was able to break Grin?ôs purported privacy while spending just $60 per week on Amazon Web Services (AWS).According to the researcher, the problem is inherent to Mimblewimble, and there is no way to fix it. Based on new findings, Mimblewimble should no longer be considered as a ?úviable alternative to Zcash or Monero when it comes to privacy,??Bogatyy declared.The expert added that Mimblewimble developers have been aware of the technical feasibility of such an attack since he posted a Reddit thread on the issue a year ago.In the analysis, Bogatyy referred to anonymity sets, which are patterns that aggregate multiple transactions into a set, such that they can no longer be distinguished. Based on anonymity sets, Bogatyy pointed out three major approaches to privacy in cryptocurrencies such as Zcash, Monero and Mimblewimble.According to the researcher, Zcash purportedly provides the maximum possible anonymity as its anonymity set includes all the shielded transactions. In Monero, users should pick their own anonymity set of size 10-25 for any existing on-chain unspent output from Bitcoin transactions (UTXO). In Mimblewimble, all transactions in a block are aggregated into one big CoinJoin, purportedly ensuring that an anonymity set is all the transactions that ended up in the same block.However, Bogatyy says he has managed to catch 96% transactions before they could be aggregated with others for anonymity. ?úSo in reality, there is no one in their anonymity set,??the expert claimed, adding that he was not able to hack all 100% transactions because there was a small minority of transactions that merged before most nodes could see them.Following Bogatyy?ôs tweet, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin replied to emphasize that Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge (zk-SNARK) is an example of the only global anonymity sets that are secure. He tweeted:?úIf your privacy model has a medium anonymity set, it really has a small anonymity set. If your privacy model has a small anonymity set, it has an anonymity set of 1.

Blockchain News ¬∑ Business News ¬∑ Technology News ¬∑ Policy & ...",23-Nov-19,"On Nov. 21, the United States Congressional Task Force on Financial Technologies held a hearing on the role of big data in financial services.¬†","The last major legislation focused on the subject was the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, which formalized a financial service firm?ôs obligations to clients ??specifically, how they share client information. Given the field?ôs expansion over the past 20 years, the Fintech Task Force?ôs posture on Thursday was that of an early exploration of options and opportunities for new and major legislation.¬†Obviously, the scene has changed remarkably since 1999. Financial services are more accessible than ever. Smartphones and powerful free apps have put financial capabilities previously reserved for industry professionals literally into the hands of everyday consumers. The flip side, as the task force seemed to acknowledge, is that many of those financial opportunities approach consumer data predatorily. The old axiom ?úif you are not paying for the product, the product is you??seemed to frame the conversation.While the public eye was largely directed at the ongoing Trump impeachment hearings the same day, the members of the Fintech Task Force ??led by chairman Stephen Lynch (D-MA) and ranking member Tom Emmer (R-MN) ??questioned five expert witnesses who testified as to the state of the industry and appropriate measures to rein in big tech.The witnesses espoused a range of views reflective of highly distinct professional backgrounds. Lauren Saunders, an associate director at the National Consumer Law Center, focused on minimizing firms??legal right to use consumer data in ways beyond those that users would reasonably expect. She also expressed concern about the ways that machine learning was amplifying discriminatory financial practices in ways that would be harder to correct than in traditional systems.¬†An associate professor of computer science at Brown University and chief scientist at Aroki Systems, Dr. Seny Kamara also believed that firms were running rampant over consumer rights. A cryptographer, Kamara showed a unique insight into ways that technology itself could limit financial service providers??access to consumer data. He cautioned, however, against excess hope in the field, saying ?úIt is easy to get carried away on a wave of technological optimism.?ùLike Saunders, Dr. Christopher Gillard, an English professor at Macomb Community College and an advisor to the Digital Pedagogy Lab, was extremely concerned about the role of new technologies in reinforcing old discrimination. He referred to ?úopaque systems that offer consumers little power of redress??in the form of practices hidden from consumers under the auspices of proprietary code. Gillard further affirmed that ?úWe must reject the notion that regulations stifle innovation.?ùMore optimistic in tone, Don Cardinal, managing director of the Financial Data Exchange (FDX), pointed to industry moves away from data practices like screen-scraping, in which customer login information is accessible to aggregators. He saw the industry as addressing the problems preemptively.Similarly, Duane Pozza, a partner at law firm Wiley Rein, sought to define the concept of big data and emphasize its role in expanding financial services. He was particularly interested in cash-flow data, which Saunders had called out as a potential major overstep when it allows loan providers to access data on merchants and specific purchases rather than vaguer information on overall balances and transfers. Saunders said that such data enabled profiling and discrimination on a major and distopian scale. Pozza saw cash-flow data as a means of freeing credit seekers from the traditional gatekeepers of credit scores.¬†Though traditional party lines did come into play, with Republicans making slightly more mention of consumer choice and Democrats more frequently bringing up consumer protection, the assembled congresspeople all seemed to be in alignment that consumers had little choice and were unprotected.¬†Chairman Lynch described the contracts users must agree to in order to access services: ?úFramed as privacy agreements, they?ôre actually lack-of-privacy agreements.??Lynch specifically called out the agreements of Mint, Venmo and Qapital, which according to him were, respectively 30, 40 and 10 pages long and filled with language that Lynch, an attorney, described as dense legalese. The consensus was that such problems are inescapable, with Rep. Ben McAdams (D-UT) opining that, as a consumer, he has no idea how many firms are using his data right now.The shared atmosphere in the room was that consumers were being failed. It was a rare moment of consensus, with the major exception of witness Don Cardinal, who was frequently quick to point out how much progress the field has seen in recent years, as well as how much financial access has expanded to new demographics thanks to innovative companies.¬†As always, solutions are trickier. Many members leaned into the prospect of more comprehensive legislation, along the lines of the European Union?ôs General Data Protection Regulation, or laws passed in recent years in California and New York ??traditionally, the tech and finance capitals of the U.S., respectively. Instances of massive financial data breaches including Equifax and Capital One loomed large over the proceedings. The bulk of the hearing presumed the need to enact legislation in response to the clear failure of financial institutions to meet due diligence in protecting these treasure troves of customer information of the most sensitive natureNew York?ôs regulation 23 NYCRR 500 placed new burdens on cybersecurity for companies handling client financial data. It took effect on March 1, 2017, but has less to do with limiting the amount of customer data that a firm can access than with establishing requirements for the cybersecurity surrounding that data. On March 1, 2019, what is perhaps the most ambitious element of the regulation was the last to come into play. This final requirement obliges financial services companies to examine and issue reports on the cybersecurity effectiveness of third-party services that also have access to the data collected by the primary firms.Passed in September 2018, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) will come into effect at the beginning of 2020. Given the portion of U.S. tech firms that are registered in the state, California?ôs status as the most-populous of the United States, as well as the law?ôs broad prescriptions for any action in any jurisdiction taken by firms operating in California, the CCPA will likely serve as either Congress?ôs template or cautionary tale for legislation on data privacy for years to come. Expect all eyes to be on its impacts on firms and its effectiveness at protecting consumers once the new year comes.¬†It was, however, clear throughout the proceedings that many of the legislators involved lacked technical expertise. Ranking Member Emmer commented on this after the hearing, telling Cointelegraph that there was clearly a ?ústeep learning curve that a lot of people in Congress have when it comes to this type of technology.??He continued:¬†?úThis body tends to look like the people that you saw up here today as opposed to young people who are writing code, on the edge and always pushing into this new universe.?ùAs Dr. Kamara pointed out during questioning, ?úServices can be provided without having to give up data.??He continued: ?úWe can minimize the amount of data collected down to 0 if we invest in the right technology.?ù¬†Cointelegraph got the chance to follow up with Kamara on the subject after the hearing, during which time he highlighted the availability of technology ?úthat allows us to process data without ever seeing it. So you can hold your data, you don?ôt ever have to release it to anybody, but I can still compute on your data and get some kind of signal from it.??When Cointelegraph asked him about zero-knowledge proofs as an example, Kamara responded that ?úyou can do similar things for computation as well. So not just proving identity, or proving knowledge of something, but computing as well.?ù¬†It was, however, clear throughout the hearing that Dr. Kamara was not suggesting that financial services providers be left to enact such technological practices out of the goodness of their hearts. In response to a question from Chairman Lynch as to why consumers were still vulnerable, Kamara answered: ?úBecause companies never had any incentive to improve their privacy practices, they have never been invested in.?ùAmong other promising technological advances that received mention during the hearing were new application programming interfaces, or APIs. Don Cardinal, in particular, saw these mechanisms as providing built-in filtration, restricting the information available to companies to what is relevant to their particular line of work.¬†Cardinal, whose work at Financial Data Exchange involves implementing FDX?ôs API, showed a particularly rosey outlook on the industry?ôs willingness to change its own practices internally. FDX?ôs press release on the event of the hearing featured the tagline ?úIndustry Proves Quick to Adopt Secure Data Sharing Standard ??Over Five Million U.S. Consumers on FDX API.?ùThursday?ôs hearing left little doubt that major federal legislation governing data usage is coming in the United States. Democrat outrage over new financial data practices targeting vulnerable groups through predatory lending and discriminatory algorithms met with Republican frustration with the obvious inability of even the most savvy of consumers to cope with the ways that their data are being manipulated beyond their control. Unless some improbably ambitious initiatives from both the private sector and existing regulators ??especially the Federal Trade Commission ??come into play to prune the overgrowth of customer data in the possession of fintech firms in advance, that legislation will be sweeping.However, do not expect legislation yet. Congress is going to wait until they can assess the new California law as a case study, and then larger committees are going to need to get up to speed with the work of Fintech Task Force, which is still a young and small wing of the Financial Services Committee. Meanwhile, stay tuned.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The company also says that this is about 1,000 times faster than the Optimistic Rollups (ORs) developed by Ethereum scalability development organization Plasma Group ??which achieves block finality in two weeks.Rollup solutions scale by moving computation off-chain and pushing result to the network later. Both O2Rs and ORs ensure data legitimacy by having validators analyze the data published on-chain.This technology offers a spectrum of use cases. The difference between the two protocols is that O2Rs only publish the data off-chain unless a validator triggers a data availability check. Thanks to this change, the new system reportedly has limitless scalability potential, and can handle much more complex applications.IDEX CEO Alex Wearn suggested in a tweet published on Nov. 6 that point of sale payment systems could use O2Rs in a scalable non-custodial payments service ?úthat can match the throughput of Visa.??He also suggested that the solution would allow for free, instantaneous transfers of video game assets digitized as non-fungible tokens.Scalability is one of the main obstacles to blockchain adoption, as blockchains currently tend to increase transaction prices or stop processing them altogether when under heavy use.

Cointelegraph YouTube Subscribe ...,20-Nov-19,"Tel Aviv-based media outlet BLOCKTV announced details of a tokenized rewards system to incentivize sources to share exclusive news tips. This comes after BLOCKTV revealed that its native token, BLTV, would be listed on the Bittrex Global exchange on Nov. 21.","BLOCKTV CEO Aviram Elad told Cointelegraph:?úWe see the BLTV token as a solution to fix a broken business model in the media industry. The token aims to empower an upcoming token economy that combines content creators, advertisers, and consumers.?ùBLTV is an ERC20 token that will be offered to publishers, journalists, advertisers, sources and viewers. It forms the backbone of a media ecosystem in which all participants get compensation for their time and effort in helping tell a story, or for consuming the ads that fund them. Building this kind of economy around a media company will drive that company?ôs growth ??or at least that is the thinking.When viewers watch advertisements on BLOCKTV, they can earn BLTV tokens in exchange for their time. The model is similar to the Basic Attention Token (BAT) offered on the Brave Browser.BLOCKTV has also said that BLTV tokens will incentivize sources to come forward with exclusive news tips and interesting content deserving a wider audience. With over 15 years of experience in journalism, Elad suggests that providing sources with digital money in exchange for news tips will help ensure consistently high-quality and original reporting within the cryptocurrency and blockchain spaces.¬†¬†?úIn my experience, when someone wants to give you a story to cover, they either want to promote themselves or someone else who they know,??Elad explained. ?úThese are the two main reasons why people want to share information today. We want to change this through a token-based economy.?ù¬†The BLTV token will begin its life on Bittrex. News sources, which could include journalists, whistleblowers, or other publication staff, can then submit tips to BLOCKTV?ôs editorial team. These stories will then be verified to ensure that they meet the company?ôs journalistic standards.?úThe token system we are building allows sources to submit a story, which we would then run by our professional editorial team to make sure that the information is true and interesting,??said Ron Friedman, BLOCKTV?ôs editor-in-chief.Upon publication of their story, sources will receive a cut of the revenue generated by that story?ôs views and engagement. The story?ôs continued performance will be monitored using smart contracts to record the number of impressions and calculate the appropriate tokenized reward.According to Friedman, BLOCKTV?ôs token model has also been optimized to align incentives between news providers and broadcasters. As a result, this creates a token model that encourages the mass distribution of quality news, while sharing the proceeds with sources.?úFor the first time ever, sources will be compensated for sharing the news with a media outlet. We also plan to add a tipping mechanism and bonus program for stories considered to be extremely important,??Friedman said.BLOCKTV CEO Elad also noted that while BLOCKTV is providing a proof-of-concept for this model, he thinks that other major media outlets will eventually adopt something similar.¬†?úBLOCKTV is just a proof of concept for this model, but eventually this will expand and be replicated not only for others in the crypto media sphere but for all news organizations,??he said.While both Elad and Friedman are optimistic that a token-based economy will ensure the production of high-quality, original content, the model also raises questions around concerns of journalistic ethics.According to Joshua Benton, director of Harvard University?ôs Nieman Journalism Lab, mainstream journalistic norms specifically call for not paying sources. Benton noted that while this may be the standard today, some have pushed back against it in a number of ways.?úTraditionally, the journalistic norm has been to not pay sources. However, some arguments have been made that go against this. For example, stories that involve multiple sources might include some that have been paid to disclose information. Also, people may not get paid directly for being a source, but could get compensated in other ways, like being offered payment for licensing photographs.?ùIn the case of BLOCKTV providing sources with BLTV tokens, Benton noted that this sounds similar to a typical publication?ôs freelance model, in which case it makes sense to provide compensation.?úThere is nothing wrong with being a journalist that pitches a good news story to a media outlet, and hopefully, there is some money exchanged there,??Benton told Cointelegraph. However, it?ôs different if payment is being exchanged to a source that is not a journalist, he warned.?úFor example, if a company has news that it wants to announce and it contacts a media organization and receives payment for publication, rather than putting the news on its own website, that would be looked down upon,??Benton explained.According to Elad, BLOCKTV will primarily accept tips and stories from freelance journalists who do not already contribute to a publication and would like to see an important story get out. Moreover, these sources could remain anonymous or choose to reveal their identity, a concept made possible through a BLTV token function called ?úBLTV newsroom.?ù‚ÄúThe BLTV token allows the source to decide if they want to remain anonymous or not. This function is called ?òBLTV newsroom??and will include a reputation score. Every journalist or publication submitting a story to the BLTV newsroom will have a ranking based on the source?ôs credibility, the history of the publication, and more,??Elad explained.Even with rigid verification of news tips and reputation scores, Benton remains skeptical of a model that uses tokens to reward its sources. This is mainly due to the financial aspect of it all ??at the end of the day, it?ôs still a source taking money for a story.?úNews organizations and journalists are supposed to be serving their readers. This means that a journalist is asked to figure out the truth as best determined on a given topic. This information is then shared with an audience,??Benton explained, adding, ?úThe more financial considerations injected into that equation, the more the audience has reason to think that maybe they are not getting the full story.?ùBenton also points out that a model such as this raises the concern that a news outlet may be producing biased news by only taking one source?ôs view into consideration.?úIf one source is getting paid to contribute to a story, it raises questions if the news organization pursued others with different perspectives on that story,??he said.Yet Benton does make an important distinction that sets BLOCKTV?ôs rewards-based model apart from questionable journalistic behaviors.?úMost journalistic corruption in the crypto world involves sources bribing journalists to run stories. This model is the opposite of that approach. However, I still think that most journalists would say that they wouldn?ôt want to have money being exchanged for certain interactions.?ù¬†¬†Benton, who reported on Civil?ôs failed initial coin offering, also noted that there is an uncertainty that comes with paying sources via cryptocurrency. As in the case of Civil, the blockchain-enabled media platform that gathered a number of journalists together last year by offering payment with its own token. The Civil ICO ultimately flamed out and the token became worthless.Based on this example, Benton notes that while a cryptocurrency can be an appealing form of exchange, some people may not be too excited about receiving compensation from a token of uncertain value.Friedman begs to differ:?úWe want to get important stories broadcasted, and that extra incentive might encourage people to come to BLOCKTV first. A token-based model allows all parts of the ecosystem to have an interest in the process of telling and sharing news, which goes hand-in-hand with core journalist values.??

and 73.12 TWh of electricity a year ??an amount on par with the ...",09-Nov-19,"The world is slowly, but¬†very surely, turning its attention to climate change, and to the human activities that are having the largest impact. The recent¬†U.N. General Assembly on Climate Change broached these topics in detail, looking at how politics, economy and human activity need to change in order to limit the damage being done to the environment.¬†","While industries such as oil and fashion leave a prominent carbon footprint that is difficult to reduce, that should not deter others, such as the tech industry, from finding solutions that limit their impact. It is pointless for industries to claim that they are veering away from older, flawed paradigms if they continue to make the same mistakes, such as failing to incorporate sustainability and fair access from the very beginning of a project. This is where emerging technologies have the opportunity to change the game.¬†Technology has the potential to address many of the issues plaguing humanity, including climate change and environmental degradation. As technologies continue to evolve, however, sustainability is not always a top priority when it comes to their ongoing development. This must change, and quickly, if the sustainable future we dream of is to be achieved.As with most technologies, blockchain in its current iteration has a number of major weaknesses when it comes to functioning in a sustainable manner. This is perhaps most evident in the mining of cryptocurrencies, and particularly in the case of Bitcoin (BTC) and the¬†vast amounts of energy required to mine it.Studies show that, across the network, mining Bitcoin requires between 52.9 and 73.12 TWh of electricity a year ??an amount on par with the annual energy consumption of Austria. This has massive implications for climate change, of course. But for the sake of argument, let?ôs imagine that all this energy is coming from low or zero-emission sources like hydro or nuclear; and yet, the need for so much power still creates other systemic issues that cannot be ignored.¬†It presents an enormous barrier to entry, for one thing. Small miners are often unable to afford the high costs associated with this amount of energy use, not to mention the exorbitant prices of high-end mining rigs capable of running the Bitcoin network, meaning they are priced out of the activity from the get-go. This has led to the need for economies of scale and the emergence of mining pools. That is, a wave of centralization that is contrary to the ethos that underpins blockchain technology as envisioned by Satoshi Nakamoto.Tech, and especially emerging tech such as blockchain, has the opportunity to take an alternate approach to its own development. The innovators of yore were starting from the ground floor, unable to visualize the potential long-term impact of their inventions. But today?ôs innovators have the advantage of centuries of hindsight. We have all seen the cost ?ì‚Ä?in both capital and lost productivity ?ì‚Ä?required to upgrade outdated, wasteful technological infrastructure. Though there will surely be future advances that we can?ôt even begin to imagine, incorporating sustainable methods from the beginning will make this process less painful in the long run.¬†When speaking about power in the context of technology, literal power in the form of energy is of course paramount. But there are also more nebulous kinds of power, such as those that arise from accessibility. As discussed in my previous article, blockchain has the potential to give power back to the people. But that can only be the case if it?ôs accessible to as many people as possible.With this in mind, those developing new blockchain projects need to do some soul searching and decide, from the outset, exactly what sort of project they want theirs to be. If they find that they want it to be truly decentralized, available to everyone regardless of economic background, then they need to choose consensus mechanisms and platform architectures that enable this ??as opposed to energy-intensive operations like proof-of-work that favor the already wealthy and promote centralization.¬†Proof-of-stake, the preeminent alternative to proof-of-work, solves the energy problem, but creates a new barrier to entry and new sources of centralization. One still has to buy into the system in order to participate, and ??by design ??those who have invested more have a higher probability of reaping rewards. The mechanisms driving centralization and inaccessibility in this case may be different, but the outcome is similar.This is why I believe that proof-of-space-time, a protocol which utilizes unused disk space on ordinary desktop PCs to run the network, holds so much promise. It?ôs permissionless like PoW but uses only a fraction of the energy needed for such. It achieves this by having network participants commit free disk space on their hard-drives and creates a blockmesh as opposed to a blockchain.¬†Ultimately, by developing technologies in a more sustainable and egalitarian manner, movers in the industry can actively take part in shaping a society where the environment is respected and there is no restriction in the power of access to newer technologies or better models. By shaping blockchain technology differently, we have the chance to not only build a tech that does not have such a burdensome effect on the environment, but which also gives everyone the power to access it and impact its future, bringing it back to its democratic roots.¬†The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author?ôs alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.Tomer Afek is the CEO and co-founder of Spacemesh, a fair and distributed blockmesh operating system powered by a unique proof-of-space-time consensus protocol.

The recommendation imposes the same standards on the cryptocurrency sector as are normally shouldered by the banking industry.Blanco further pointed out that FinCEN has been conducting investigations that include compliance with the travel rule since 2014, adding that it is the most commonly cited violation among money service businesses engaged in digital currencies.In October, Blanco spoke at the University of Georgetown where he said that AML laws apply to everyone. Blanco pointed to the key objective of AML policy, which is obtaining information about who is involved in a given payment, saying:""There is a reason you want to know ... the person on the other side of that transaction ??they might be dealing in some kind of illicit activity. Whether it?ôs opioids ... or human smuggling on the other side ... you want to know who that person is.?ùBlanco told the audience at the time that it is not that hard to obtain that information. ?úAll we?ôre asking for is name, address, account number, transaction, recipient, and amount,??he said, adding:?úSo when you tell me you don?ôt know who?ôs on the other side, you?ôve got a big problem. Because you are required to know, and that is what our expectation is going to be.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

looking to issue a Bitcoin bond surfaced. Marouane el-Abassi, the ...",22-Nov-19,"Earlier this month, many blockchain media outlets, including Cointelegraph itself as well as Decrypt, Beincrypto and LedgerInsight, reported that Tunisia had become the first country to digitize its national currency on a blockchain platform. But that news was incorrect. The story was originally was broken on Nov. 7 by two Russian state-owned news agencies, Tass and Iz.ru, which also highlighted that the Russian blockchain platform Universa was assisting the Central Bank of Tunisia, or BCT, in the task.¬†","By Nov. 11, the BCT denied all claims regarding the development of a central bank digital currency. Specifically, the bank declared that although it is ?úworking on finance digitalisation,??it does not have any kind of relationship with any domestic or foreign firm.Alexander Borodich, the CEO of Universa, who was quoted in both original reports, claimed on Nov. 11 that the media misinterpreted the situation. However, Borodich had posted a link on Nov. 8 to one of the news stories on his Facebook page, and even said in an interview released on Nov. 10, saying that:¬†?úSo, we were able to launch ??Tunisia launched, using our technology, the national digital currency.?ù¬†Overall, the startup actively participated in the news cycle, distributing the information through interviews and social media up to a day before the BCT's statement.On Nov. 7, Tass and Iz.ru ran news articles with headlines that translate as ?úRussian developers will ensure the turnover of the electronic currency of Tunisia??and ?úDigital dinar: Tunisia launches electronic currency,??respectively.The Tass report reads, ?úTunisia has become the first country to announce the transfer of part of the country's money supply to electronic form,??while Iz.ru alleges that Borodich said, ?úTunisia?ôs digital money is not cryptocurrency, but a CBDC.??Both of them highlighted that Universa was handling the technical side of the project.The CBDC ??dubbed the ?úuDinar??by Universa Hub Africa, though similar projects have used the term ""eDinar"" ??was set to be state-owned and backed by paper money, the reports claimed. Blockchain, in turn, would protect it against counterfeiting and make issuance cheaper and more transparent. The Tass article quoted Borodich as saying:?úElectronic banknotes cannot be faked ??each such banknote, like the paper version, is protected by cryptography, it, like the paper counterpart, has its own digital watermarks. And the production of such a banknote is 100 times cheaper than spending ink, paper, electricity for the printing press.?ùAdditionally, the news pieces noted that Universa was set to receive a percentage of all transactions carried out with the uDinar, and the ledger would be visible to the country?ôs central bank.¬†On Nov. 12, Tunisia?ôs central bank issued its official announcement that refuted all claims regarding the development of the uDinar. The central bank clarified that it is currently exploring various methods of digital payment alternatives, including a possible CBDC, but has yet to proceed with its implementation. The bank further stated:""The BCT is presently working on finance digitalisation, in its digital currency dimension and not the one involving crypto-currency. Its departments are considering the opportunities and risks inherent to these new technologies, notably as regards cyber security and financial stability.""Notably, the BCT pointed to a possible cause of the misleading reports. The bank noted that the Forex Club of Tunisia featured talks regarding CBDCs. On Nov. 7, the club held an event that was hosted by an ?úan independent association from the BCT????most likely the event?ôs tech partner, Universa Hub Africa. Cointelegraph did not receive a response from the Forex Club regarding the event.According to the BTC?ôs statement, participants at this event attended a ?útechnical feasibility demonstration of a digital currency theoretical solution,??initiated by an unnamed private startup that has ?úno moral or contractual relationship whatsover with the BCT,??the announcement elaborated, concluding:¬†?úThis Proof of concept was taken out of context, becoming thereby a marketing operation where the BCT?ôs name has been unduly used.?ùThe BCT didn't respond to a request for comment for this story to confirm, among other topics, which startup participated in the said proof of concept.Once the news cycle started, when media reports alleging that Tunisia had become the first country to issue a CBDC surfaced, Universa itself began to circulate since-debunked reports, sharing links on its social media channels, including Twitter and Telegram.¬†Further, on Nov. 7, Cointelegraph received an email sent from a private Gmail address and signed by Mikhail Dremidov. Titled ?úURGENT: Tunisia issues state e-currency CBDC on Universa,??the letter contained a link to the above mentioned Iz.ru news piece.¬†As per LinkedIn, someone with the same name, Mikhail Dremidov, is listed as a PR manager at Universa. When Cointelegraph asked what company Dremidov was speaking for and why he would promote a news story that was later refuted by an official source, the email sender replied that ?úI represent myself.??He also referred to the press release written by Universa CEO Borodich that described the recent events in detail.Borodich argued in the press release that on Nov. 7, Universa Hub Africa launched uDinar, backed by the Tunisian dinar, as a proof of concept and that ?úno question of CBDC √©mission related to uDinar was discussed at the Forex Club Tunisie Congress.?ù¬†He also confirmed that the BCT ?úhas no contractual aspect on CBDC with Universa Hub Africa.??Finally, he claimed that ?úthe misinterpretation in the articles that followed was not based on claims of Universa?ôs or BCT official representatives.?ùWhen pressed about why he would refer Cointelegraph to a story that was proven false, Dremidov ??who also admitted that he provides ?úpart-time consulting services in PR??and referred to Borodich as ?úour CEO??as the discussion continued ??said that he ?úwas not in Tunisia and thought that the information in TASS was true.?ù¬†The articles were written wholly by Russian journalists who were present at the Forex Club Tunisie Congress, he added, while Universa?ôs official position could only be represented by their CEO ??i.e., Borodich, who was speaking at the event. When asked to confirm the authenticity of Borodich?ôs quotes featured in both the Tass and Iz.ru stories, Dremidov replied:?úI can?ôt confirm the quotes because I was not in Tunisia and don?ôt understand French for my pity. I provide a part-time consulting services in PR, but I can confirm that the titles of articles (TASS and IZ.ru) are incorrect and that's what made readers confused.?ùNotably, while the conference was held mostly in French, Borodich delivered his presentation in English, as seen in the video recorded at the Forex Club Tunisie Congress.Dremidov also said that Universa was trying to reach out to Tass and Iz.ru to update the pieces. ?úThat?ôs hard because they are huge media giants,??he explained. Cointelegraph has also contacted Tass and Iz.ru to confirm the authenticity of their reports but has not received any responses.¬†Borodich provided similar answers upon a request from Cointelegraph. When asked how exactly he was contacted by Tass and Iz.ru's reporters, and whether they explained to him that they were going to break news on Tunisia launching a CBDC based on Universa?ôs blockchain, the CEO replied:?úThere was a press-conference, just after uDinar demo on stage. All articles have been written by reporters on their own and based on their editorial policy. They did not explain anything to me.?ùHe added: ?úWe asked TASS and Iz.ru to update their articles via e-mail. As you know, TASS is the major state-owned media agency with lots of departments. It took time.?ùBorodich evaded answering why Universa posted links to the original reports on its social media channels, contacted Cointelegraph via email implying that it was newsworthy material, posted one of those links on his private Facebook feed, and told an interviewer that ?úTunisia launched, using our technology, the national digital currency.""¬†He did answer the following question, however: If you knew that IZ.ru and Tass had exaggerated the scope of Universa's partnership with Tunisian officials, why would you continue to channel those statements? To that, the Universa CEO stated:¬†?úIt took time to clarify our points of view about definitions ?òu-dinar, e-dinar??etc because of the weekend. It took time to translate everything either. The Congress was in french language. We have 10 years partnership with Tunisia and the last thing we wanted is something which my harm our previous achievements with digitalisation there. We do respect all our partners and behave accordingly.?ùFurther, according to a press release issued by the Forex Club Tunisie Congress, the event featured ?úa simple theoretical demonstration of a digital currency developed by a Tunisian fintech labelled Start-up Act.??It continued:¬†?úTherefore, what has been reported by some press regarding the issuance by the Central Bank of Tunisia of a digital currency at this congress is unfounded.?ùThe press release then went on to outline that there was indeed a debate held regarding the possible issuance of CBDCs, where an expert from the International Monetary Fund outlined the possible risks of issuing such an asset.Interestingly, the statement mentioned neither Universa Hub Africa nor the uDinar project, although they were indeed part of the conference, as seen on the video broadcast. The aforementioned IMF expert is Herve Tourpe clarified that the BCT has not yet launched a digital currency and later called the reports of a CBDC ?úfake news.?ùAn IMF representative speaking on behalf of Tourpe told Cointelegraph that he had no comment. The Tunisian Forex Club has not responded to Cointelegraph?ôs requests for comment, while Start-up Act told Cointelegraph that it is ?únot involved in this topic with BCT.?ù¬†Universa?ôs token, UTNP, experienced a pump that lasted throughout the first news cycle and traded at almost $0.007 during its peak, according to data from Coin360. Once the BCT refuted the story, however, Universa?ôs price shed more than 50%. According to Dremidov, however, ?úthere was no dump??but ?útwo sales of $12k approximately.?ùIn Universa?ôs official Telegram group, some investors felt misinformed. ?úIt wasn?ôt only the media that reported the news wrong, it was also Universa?ôs team that reported the news wrong,??a user nicknamed Uly55 wrote at the time. ?úIt was posted here and on twitter that it?ôs a CBDC. But nothing, no explanation, no apology.??Another user nicknamed @BitJox argued: ?úThe worst thing in this story is the reactions of the admins yesterday when people were congratulating them of the ?òLaunch of the CBDC.??Admins were not denying anything.?ùUpon being contacted by Cointelegraph, Uly55 explained that he no longer felt like he was misled. ?úThat post was done in the heat of the moment, before everything was cleared up,??the user said of his initial concern. ?úFrom my understanding it was the news who grabbed the wrong news and then it spread fast, too fast for Universa to handle it.?ùBitJox, on the other hand, told Cointelegraph that this story made him stop buying more Universa tokens. When asked whether he felt like Universa mislead him, he replied: ?úThey obviously did.??He then clarified that he didn?ôt know if it was intentional, although he?ôs inclined to say that it was:?úOn the [Universa] telegram group, all users who haven't been banned by the admins are talking about ?òdeep state practices??from the IMF.?ùBiJox believes that this could be true, but thinks the head of Universa HUB Africa, Omar Bouattay, was speaking at the conference about Universa issuing the uDinar, not the government, which he believes would make it an ordinary coin and not a CBDC. He went on to add:¬†?úSo yeah, I think they totally lied by playing with words. They made us think CBDC is backed and managed by a central bank. But it's actually issued by a private company.?ù‚ÄúThe worst thing in this story,??according to Bitjox, is that while a private company unveiled its plans to issue the uDinar, there is no information about which company is going to audit that process:?úWe don't know if U-Dinar is really backed by actual paper money or by thin air.?ùThe first reports on Tunisia experimenting with digital currencies date back to 2015, when Swiss software startup Monetas (whose CEO has since gained notoriety due to the Tezos scandal) announced the pilot launch of eDinar, a digital currency developed in partnership with Tunisia?ôs post office (La Poste Tunisienne) and local startup DigitUs. There have been no updates on the project since, and its website is currently offline.Further, in April, media reports suggesting that Tunisia?ôs central bank was looking to issue a Bitcoin bond surfaced. Marouane el-Abassi, the governor of the country?ôs central bank, had reportedly announced in April this year that Tunisia had created a working group for this purpose.¬†He also added that Tunisia had launched the eDinar and had already been processing transactions through a native Poste Tunisienne system developed by DigitUs.Meanwhile, the latest announcement from the BCT suggests that the central bank is open to ideas involving blockchain but prefers to go slow with the technology?ôs implementation and even more so with a digital currency.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pay-to-Play Gaming Is Flawed, Blockchain-Based Platform ...",22-Nov-19,"Harvard University?ôs Kennedy School carried out a live simulation of a White House National Security Council meeting on Nov. 19, featuring former senior administration officials and thought leaders. The ?úDigital Currency Wars??event examined a potential future scenario, following a North Korean missile test, potentially enabled by China?ôs proposed digital yuan.","The simulation was set two years in the future, with China?ôs digital yuan having theoretically been launched 20 months previously. The digital yuan has risen to not only dominate the Chinese domestic payments space, but its ease of use and the Belt and Road Initiative is seeing adoption spread across South East Asia.The game includes a newsflash of a North Korean missile test, more advanced than Washington had believed, and thought to have been funded through U.S. sanction avoidance via the use of the digital yuan.With sanctions failing, the Security Council meeting discussed options to put to the president.One of the key points put forward was that the U.S. would at this point be reliant on the Chinese. The simulated Treasury Secretary pointed out:?úWe will not successfully starve North Korea economically without the cooperation of China, and certainly not if it is their objective to see us fail.?ùHe also pointed out the 30 years of history in which the U.S. had not been successful in persuading China to use its leverage.The meeting was interrupted mid-way through with another newsflash, this time revealing that the SWIFT system had been cyber-attacked and $3 billion stolen from commercial banks in Germany, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates.The eventual recommendations which the group decided to put forward to the president hinged on measures attempting to prevent a bifurcation of the global economy.The weaponization of SWIFT was proving less effective, although some at the meeting still seemed intent on hardening the system and relying on existing strategies. The more forward-thinking attendees felt that more should be done to ensure the U.S. had a similar digital currency capacity, to resuscitate its financial power.This included the option of putting diplomatic pressure on China to cooperate, use electronic intelligence to highlight North Korea?ôs sanction breaking, or develop its own digital dollar competitor. The threat of military pressure was also considered as a less desirable option.As American policymakers increasingly engage with the blockchain and cryptocurrency space, several lawmakers have called for rapid regulation and legal certainty for the nascent technology and digital assets, so as not to fall too far behind more lenient jurisdictions.As Cointelegraph recently reported, the number of Chinese blockchain patents now numbers in the upper 7,000s, outstripping the U.S. over three times.A Chinese blockchain investor recently stated that a digital yuan is in the advanced stages of development, and is likely to launch with the next six to 12 months.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Crypto Platform Sees Its User Base Grow Amid the Global Pandemic.",14-Nov-19,Australian blockchain energy firm Power Ledger and Indian electricity distribution company BSES Rajdhani Power Limited (BRPL) have completed a peer-to-peer (P2P) solar power trading trial in the country.,"Power Ledger announced the news in a press release shared with Cointelegraph on Nov. 14, detailing that it carried out a large-scale P2P energy trading trial in the Dwarka region, South West Delhi, which initially comprised 5-6 megawatts (MW) of already existing solar infrastructure serving an array of gated communities.The project enabled residents with rooftop solar infrastructure to sell excess solar energy to neighboring households. The trial aimed to give participants access to cheaper, renewable energy and let solar infrastructure owners monetize their surplus energy.¬†?úBRPL was able to access a cost-effective energy alternative during the times of peak demand pricing leading to increased efficiency and reliability of the power supply,??Power Ledger stated. BRPL CEO Amal Sinha commented on the trial results:?úWith the exponential growth in our economy and production, the ability to generate clean energy and utilize it across India without the need for a fully centralized grid is critical. Realizing the importance of distributed generation, we have already built an extensive renewables infrastructure, and this trial with Power Ledger will help us fully utilize that energy.?ùSolar power is a fast-growing source of energy in India, as the country has the lowest capital cost per MW to install solar power plants globally. As of September, the country?ôs solar capacity exceeded 31 gigawatts.¬†In recent months, Power Ledger has conducted other blockchain-based energy trading trials in different countries. Earlier in November, the company partnered with a local energy retailer to roll out its technology in South Australia, allowing Australians to pool their excess solar and battery storage to a Virtual Power Plant for greater control and management of their energy.In early October, Power Ledger revealed its plans to run another blockchain-enabled energy trading trial in Japan?ôs Kanto region by December 2019. The trial will track surplus solar energy levels and electricity trading, integrating a blockchain-enabled P2P platform with household smart meter systems in the Kanto region.Recent research from Navigant Research, a Colorado-based market research and consulting firm, showed that energy blockchain applications are expected to see a 67% compound annual growth rate over the next 10 years.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) rather than regulated security tokens.",15-Nov-19,"On Nov. 7, Ashley Alder, the CEO of the Securities and Futures Commission of Hong Kong, said at a conference that a new framework for crypto exchanges will be implemented. Almost immediately after the announcement, Reuters reported that a crypto exchange based in Hong Kong called OSL became the first to apply for a license with the SFC.","While the introduction of a license for crypto exchanges by the government of Hong Kong is widely viewed as positive reinforcement for the growth of the crypto sector in Asia, some view it as a redundant solution that fails to facilitate the needs of local exchanges.In a conversation with Cointelegraph, George Harrap, the co-founder and CEO of Bitspark, a company based in Hong Kong that allows crypto-to-cash trades, said that the framework is not applicable to the majority of exchanges that operate within the region.Simply put, because the framework restricts the scope of the license to companies that facilitate security token trades and serve institutional investors, it does not provide additional regulatory clarity to local companies. Harrap noted that this will not apply to any existing Hong Kong-based exchanges:?úThe restrictions are many: security tokens only (of which literally none of traded on exchanges, even after 3 years of talking about it), institutional clients only (of which HK doenst really have any, its all retail and HNW) and requirement of insurance which doesn't really exist for this business. It's also part of the sandbox so there are restrictions on how many clients you can onboard anyway, not good for growth.?ùMost exchanges based in Hong Kong that provide support to local users and investors in mainland China through over-the-counter trading are focused on offering liquidity for major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) rather than regulated security tokens.As such, the framework released by the SFC, in its current form, is not necessarily relevant to major exchanges that operate in Hong Kong. ?úSo as I can see, this is not useful and nobody except perhaps lawyers and consultants were asking for this,??Harrap added.Although the SFC?ôs criteria for crypto exchanges has seen mixed reactions from the local community, several exchange executives consider it to be an overall positive factor for growth over the long term.Jason Lau, the chief operating officer at OKCoin and head of business development at OKGroup, said that having an option to be regulated ??regardless of the scope of the regulation ??is a big step for the industry.Dovey Wan, a founding partner at Primitive Crypto, said that the framework could positively affect local exchanges serving mainland Chinese investors like Huobi, adding that it is ?úbig??for the sector.Despite being an important crypto exchange market in the aftermath of the imposition of a ban by the People?ôs Bank of China on trading of cryptocurrencies, Hong Kong has lacked clear guidelines for exchanges for years. It can be argued that based on the structure of the license criteria, guidelines in Hong Kong still remain ambiguous for local companies.However, firms anticipate that it could become a stepping stone toward the introduction of a more practical and comprehensive regulatory framework for trading platforms in the future.In Hong Kong, many mainland investors are said to be trading cryptocurrencies in Hong Kong through Tether (USDT), a stablecoin whose value is pegged one-to-one with the U.S. dollar. Often, traders purchase Tether to invest in major cryptocurrencies and convert Tether to the Hong Kong dollar to sell their cryptocurrency holdings for fiat, as reported by SCMP.Previously, Terence Tsang, the CEO of Hong Kong- and Taiwan-based cryptocurrency exchange TideBit, said that the scrutiny from the Chinese government was targeted at local exchanges in China claiming to be based outside of the country, not at companies that are already based outside of the nation.Since exchanges in Hong Kong that have been facilitating trades for mainland investors have operated without significant roadblocks throughout the past two years, and given that the scope of the SFC?ôs framework is not inclusive of major cryptocurrencies, Harrap told Cointelegraph that the license criteria is unlikely to have any impact, adding that:?úA license also does not improve the banking situation in HK, even if licensed, banks won't open accounts for business areas they don't want to service of which crypto is one.?ùRegardless of the direction the SFC may be heading with its newly released criteria for exchanges, Hong Kong is moving toward tightening its oversight over the local cryptocurrency market.In December 2018, the SFC directly contacted cryptocurrency exchanges rumored to have had troubles with processing deposits and withdrawals for users, and requested several initial coin offerings to shut down.The SFC?ôs warning against cryptocurrencies late last year was primarily targeted at ICOs, but it emphasized that it will look over exchanges operating in the local market. Even at the time, Timothy Loh, a Hong Kong-based lawyer, said that the requirements set forth by the SFC could be burdensome for local companies.Hence, even though the general sentiment around the approach of the SFC remains positive among local executives and companies, it is possible that the additional requirements could create a tougher environment for companies to operate in. This could be especially true for Japan, South Korea and other Asian markets creating clear regulatory frameworks to support local companies.In recent months, major markets with top fiat-to-crypto trading pairs ??such as the United States dollar, Japanese yen, South Korean won and British pound ??have started to increase compliance with the guidelines created by the G-7?ôs Financial Action Task Force.As the global cryptocurrency exchange market adapts clearer policies for trading platforms that are described by the FATF as ?úVirtual Asset Service Providers,??Hong Kong and others that have struggled to clearly define rules for exchanges in the past are expected to embrace more efficient policies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During his tenure, China soared to become one of the world?ôs leading economies.Zhou made his comments during a speech delivered in Beijing as part of the 10th Caixin Summit on Nov. 8, according to a tweet from Dovey Wan, founding partner of blockchain investment firm Primitive Ventures.A rough translation of Zhou Xiaochuan?ôs remarks reveals that his take on Libra is guided by concerns surrounding the implications of the asset being governed by a consortium of private-sector firms.The former governor stressed that the general public will inevitably question the motivations of the Libra Association and argued that more trust would be afforded to the initiative if it was in the hands of an international organization such as the IMF.¬†The Libra Association will undoubtedly make a profit from the project, he noted, and could then use the money for other things ??such as potentially channeling it into the provision of other financial services.Notwithstanding these arguments, he suggested that broadly speaking, an initiative such as Libra was a positive development.As reported, the People?ôs Bank of China ??an institution is expected to become the first in the world to launch a central bank digital currency (CBDC).¬†The project ??which has been framed by some as having been accelerated by the direct competition posed by Libra ??has generated considerable interest in the cryptocurrency industry.¬†PBoC Deputy Director Mu Changchun revealed this August that the CBDC will be structured as a centralized, two-tier system, with the PBoC at the top tier and the second tier managed by domestic commercial banks.Recently, Ethereum (ETH)?ôs co-founder and ConsenSys CEO Joe Lubin expressed his belief that the People?ôs Bank of China is unlikely to implement the decentralized design of blockchain for its forthcoming CBDC.¬†Lubin argued that the asset is likely to be used to maintain Chinese authorities??existing oversight of capital flows and that, if anything, the PBoC will make use of ?úsome of the cryptographic primitives of blockchain.??

Maker said it will be monitoring developments closely and will update users when action is required.Maker plans to gradually phase-out Sai. While Maker does not have an exact date for the full shift to MCD and expects it to come in several months from the launch, the startup says it will help users convert their SAI to MCD in advance, according to the post.Specifically, Dai users will be able to convert their SCD to MCD via the Argent wallet soon after Nov. 18, Maker noted. According to an Argent tweet today, the SAI-DAI conversion feature will be released in the coming weeks.Additionally, the new Dai will be available on the Compound protocol, which will allow users to earn interest from holding Dai tokens. In order to start earning interest from Dai, users will have to remove their old Dai from Compound and move the converted MCD back into Compound, Maker explained. While Compound confirmed their plans for Dai integration in mid-October, there is no specific date set for the change, according to Maker.MCD system?ôs launch plans were first revealed by the Maker Foundation?ôs CEO Rune Christensen in mid-October. The launch of MCD is expected to unlock two key features ??the Dai Savings Rate as well as new collateral types for collateralized debt positions (CDPs), which is another important aspect of the Dai?ôs smart contract ecosystem.As reported, Dai is different from typical currency-backed stablecoins as it is not supported with bank accounts of reserve currencies but is generated by putting Ether (ETH) into a CDP smart contract.
