That would confirm a bearish crossover – the first of these MAs since April 17, 2018.Seasoned traders would argue that MA crossovers are based on past data and are lagging indicators. While that’s true, BTC is already on the defensive, having repeatedly failed to break above a 3.5-month bearish trendline in the last three weeks.The cryptocurrency has also found acceptance below the 200-day MA – a barometer of long-term trend. As such, the impending bear cross will likely bolster the bearish sentiment and give prices another nudge down.The cryptocurrency has pulled back from $9,300 to $8,600 in the last few days, validating the bearish view put forward by the multiple rejections at the trendline connecting June and August highs.The relative strength index is hovering below 50, indicating a bearish bias, while the MACD histogram is producing deeper bars below the zero line – also a sign of strengthening downside momentum.So, the 50-day MA support at $8,543 could be breached ahead of the bear cross. Below that level, the next major support is seen at $8,000.The bearish case would weaken if there is a strong bounce from the 50-day MA, but that seems a tall order right now. A high-volume UTC close above the descending trendline hurdle at $9,200 is needed for bullish reversal.Note that confirmation of the bear cross, however, could mark an interim bottom in BTC, as has been seen historically.BTC sell-off ran out of steam near $275 two days ahead of a bear cross confirmation on Oct. 7, 2014, following which prices jumped to levels above $400 by mid-October, according to Bitstamp data. Another bear cross on April 29 the same year was followed by consolidation in the range of $420-$450 and a rally to $680 by early June.And in 2018, prices rallied from $7,900 to levels near $10,000 in the 2.5 weeks following the bear cross in mid-April.Back then, BTC was better bid in the days leading up to the crossover with prices rising from $6,500 to $8,500. In such situations, looming bearish crossovers barely receive any market attention.Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.Bitcoin image via Shutterstock; charts by Trading View"

So, it seems safe to say the market sentiment is extremely bearish. The RSI is holding well below 50 and pointing south (above left), confirming the bearish trend in the market.  The MACD histogram is also printing deeper bars below the zero line, indicating a strengthening of bearish momentum.   The cryptocurrency is trapped in a falling channel (above right), represented by the trendlines connecting June and August highs and July and September lows. As a result, a further drop to the channel support at $6,800 cannot be ruled out. That said, a minor bounce to $7,700–$7,800 may be seen first, according to the intraday charts. The RSI on the hourly chart is producing higher lows as opposed to lower lows on the price chart – bullish divergence suggesting sellers may be running out of steam. The RSI on the 4-hour chart is hovering well below 30, indicating oversold conditions. The series of lower highs and lower lows seen above indicates the bears are in control. The immediate outlook would turn bullish only if and when prices invalidate the lower highs setup with a move above $8,231. Overall, the outlook as per the weekly chart will remain bearish as long as the RSI is held below 53.00 and the price is trapped in a falling channel.Note that as per textbook rules, RSI’s move above 50 implies a bullish reversal. In this case, however, 53.00 is the demarcation line between the bulls and the bears. This is due to the fact that the indicator consistently bounced up from 53.00 levels throughout the 2016-17 bull market. That level was breached in early January 2018 following which BTC fell to $6,000 on Feb. 6.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The  drop marked a downside break of a 48-hour narrowing price range seen above $8,000.Notably, with a slide to levels below $7,900, bitcoin has erased 80 percent of the rally from $7,293 to $10,350 seen in the second half of October.On a month-to-date basis, he cryptocurrency is now reporting a loss of over 13 percent. Further, the cryptocurrency is trading in the red for the fourth straight week.The dismal performance contradicts the positive seasonality factor: bitcoin has put on a good show in November in six out of the last eight years. Notably, prices gained for six straight years in November, starting from 2012 to 2017, before falling hard in November 2018.The hefty month-to-date losses also contradict historical data which show bitcoin picks up a strong bid six months ahead of the miners' reward halving, a supply cut next scheduled for May 2020.That said, the repeated failure to hold above a descending (bearish) 5-month MA in the first eight days of the month had raised the possibility of a drop to $8,000.The technical charts are now calling further decline to support at $7,714 – the 100-candle moving average on the three day chart. That would be the first test of the crucial average support since the end of April.As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $7,920 on Bitstamp, representing a 1.30 percent drop on a 24-hour basis.The contracting triangle breakdown seen on the hourly chart is backed by a solid rise in trading volumes and indicates a resumption of the downtrend.The MACD histogram on the three-day chart, an indicator used to identify trend changes and strength, has dropped below zero, confirming a bearish bias. Meanwhile, the 14-day relative strength index is reporting bearish conditions with a below-50 reading.BTC, therefore, looks set to test the three-day 100-candle MA at $7,714. Note that the ascending (bullish) 10-month MA is also located at $7,751.As a result, $7,751–$7,714 is the key support range for BTC. A strong bounce from there to levels above $8,000 would neutralize the immediate bearish view.The series of lower highs and lower lows seen on the 8-hour chart indicate the path of least resistance is to the downside.A short-term bullish reversal would be confirmed if and when prices rise above the Nov. 17 high of $8,631, invalidating the bearish lower-highs setup.

If the MA’s continue to converge as currently, the cross looks likely in late December or early 2020, but it’s still too early for a precise call.There is inherent risk involved with making such comparisons from previous years, as market conditions have changed significantly. Yet there is merit for seeking additional confirmation in the long-term trend, since BTC’s miner reward halving in May 2020 is likely to stir up a bunch of market activity as the supply-cutting event approaches.Total weekly volume has shrunk from two weeks ago, an indication of market indecision on a fairly stagnant price, while the RSI is barely trending bullish above 52.7 (neutral being 50).However, should the two lines converge and then cross bullish,  that would be a strong indication that the 2019 reversal rally has legs. With a strong fundamental event for BTC occurring right around the corner, it’s important to take note of the bullish signals on larger time frames.More immediately, the daily chart suggests market equilibrium, as prices have been largely stuck within a $650 range for nearly two weeks.BTC’s price action has been caught between the 100-day and 200-day MAs for 12 days.Generally speaking, when prices are above the 200-day MA, the long-term trend can be considered bullish. Conversely, if prices are beneath the 100-day MA then that is an indication of mid-term (30-60 day) bearish conditions.The current scenario highlights the indecisive sentiment felt across the market. A repeated failure to close above the 100-day MA could open up doors to $8,800 in the immediate short-term, as previously discussed.Indecision will continue until a firm close above $9,573 (100-day MA) or below $9,180 (200-day MA) occurs with conviction, until then, continued sideways ranging can be expected.Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.Bitcoin image via Shutterstock; charts by TradingView"

Back in early 2018, a long-term bear cross saw prices fall by as much as 60 percent.While past events are not indicative of future results, it does raise the question: how far can bitcoin's value fall?Further losses will expose prices to the 100-period moving average on the weekly chart, now located at $7,520.With a lack of bullish fundamentals, bitcoin is deflating under seller pressure, as reflected in the daily and weekly RSI's (not shown) which are in bearish territory beneath the neutral 50.00 line.Selling volume has also risen to its highest in three days, adding to the credence of the downside move.The bulls need to enter back into the fray in force if they hope to stem the bleeding, and need a firm close above $9,000 to reverse the current trend.

Acceptance above that hurdle would have meant a revival of the bull market set in motion by a solid break above $5,000 in early April.The inability to pass that level (currently around $9,335) has weakened the bullish case put forward by the high-volume rise from $7,300 to $10,300 on Oct. 25–26.Markets usually test dip demand after multiple rejections at key resistance and bitcoin is already feeling the pull of gravity. At press time, the cryptocurrency is trading at $8,680 on Bitstamp, representing a 1 percent drop on a 24-hour basis.Losses could be extended further with the 200-day moving average support now breached. The barometer of long-term market trend is currently located at $9,236. Other technical indicators have also turned bearish over the weekend.BTC is losing altitude, having faced rejection at the descending trendline for three straight weeks.The 14-week relative strength index (RSI) remains in bearish territory below resistance at 53.00. It’s worth noting that the 53.00–55.00 range acted as a strong support throughout the 2016–2017 bull run.Hence, a move above 55.00, if and when it occurs, could be taken as a confirmation of bull market.Bitcoin’s failure to hold above the descending, bearish 5-candle MA (above left), as represented by the November candle’s upper wick, is translating into a price drop, as expected.The MACD histogram on the daily chart (right) has crossed below zero over the weekend and is currently signaling at its most bearish since Oct. 3 with a -59.00 reading.  The RSI is currently bearish below 50.BTC has also found acceptance below the 200-day MA – a level that acted as strong support in the nine days to Nov. 7.All-in-all, BTC appears on track to test and possibly breach the 50-day MA at $8,552. A violation there would expose the psychological support of $8,000.On the higher side, a convincing move above the 3.5-month descending trendline hurdle, currently at $9,335, is needed to confirm a bullish breakout.Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.Bitcoin image via Shutterstock; charts by Trading View"

Towns pointed to Chaincode developer John Newbery's weekly bitcoin review group as a model for roping developers into the review process.BIPs are always public for anyone to review and there are plenty of avenues for offering feedback, like, worst case, if there's a security vulnerability with the code. But not everyone knows how this process works.The project description admits that ""not many people are familiar with reviewing BIPs in the first place, and there are a lot of concepts involved in the three BIPs for people to get their heads around.""But Square Crypto project manager Steve Lee is encouraged this is a way to get more developers involved. “People from all over the world have registered, and many names I have not heard of before,"" he said. Square is a sizable investor and innovator in bitcoin tech. In the midst of a sprawling code change, consensus is hard to achieve. Towns says there is a three-step process: identifying the need for a change, writing the code that implements the change, and “having everyone using bitcoin adopt the new code so that the change actually happens,"" Towns said. This study group is part of stage one, he said, with participants scrutinizing a handful of ""BIPs,"" or technical proposals for improving bitcoin.""It’s where we get the details nailed down so that we can work out if things actually make sense or it’s all pie-in-the-sky dream,"" Towns told CoinDesk.Though it's a long process, several BIPs have made their way into the bitcoin code over the last decade. Perhaps the best-known is Segregated Witness (SegWit), a change that paved the way for lightning network, early-stage technology that might be bitcoin's best chance at reaching a higher volume of users.Developers have been discussing adding Schnorr to bitcoin for years. With no major problems found so far, it and Taproot look like a shoe-in.That said, this effort will bring more eyes to the BIPs. And experts will be closely guiding developers who have never been through the BIP process before.Participants are spending four-plus hours a week over the next two months sifting proposals and talking them over in small groups.The BIP group is holding a series of Q&As with experts long-time immersed in bitcoin's underlying technology.As Towns described it, the group formed almost by accident, just as a decentralized bitcoin development process often does.Developers chat about changes to bitcoin over Internet Relay Chat (IRC). The chat group is completely open – any bitcoiner is invited to join these chat groups, whether to read the transcripts to learn about bitcoin, or to contribute new ideas.One such discussion centered on how to get the change Taproot to the next level.""A few of us were chatting on IRC about the Taproot proposal and how to move on from the current draft BIPs to the next steps, and how we would even know when people were comfortable enough with the BIPs that it was time to do that,"" Towns said. ""A couple of hours later we had a shared doc with a rough draft of what that might look like, and it ballooned from there.""The spontaneity of the two-month program highlights how flexible the bitcoin development process can be. Anyone who understands the current processes well enough can try to take initiative. The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The firm said it’s offering qualifying wholesale and professional investors such as family offices and high-net-worth individuals exposure to the cryptocurrency via a “standard unlisted fund structure” without the effort and risk of holding it directly.DigitalX executive director Leigh Travers said in the announcement:“DigitalX has held its bitcoin position through the 2017 bull market and 2018 drawdown because of our fundamental long-term belief in the value of the asset. What has become more and more apparent to us as we speak to investors and market participants generally, is that there is a growing interest in accessing bitcoin from people who have traditionally not considered investment in digital assets.”To get the fund off the ground, DigitalX will provide 215 of its total 431 bitcoin, valuing its investment at around US$1.89 million at current prices. The firm said it aims to quickly grow the investment vehicle and hence its funds under management, and will see income via the fees receivable from the fund. Management fees are disclosed as being set at 1.65 percent annually, while no performance fees will be charged.The fund’s holdings will be secured via custody services provided by insurance-backed BitGo. DigitalX further plans to use “blockchain-based security” for the registration and transfer of units in the fund.The Bitcoin Fund is licensed and administered by Boutique Capital, which is also the licensee of DigitalX’s existing indexed crypto fund. Launched last April, that fund was said to give exposure to “leading” crypto assets and potentially ICO tokens.DigitalX, following a move into bitcoin mining that was later abandoned, has morphed into a company offering blockchain consulting and development services and asset management. It’s not been without its controversies, having been taken to court by investors over an ICO for which it acted as adviser.

exchange-traded fund (ETF), and the SEC has delayed or rejected each one ...","Nov 23, 2019 at 08:30 UTC",David Weisberger is co-founder and CEO of CoinRoutes and a veteran of building trading desks and financial technology businesses. The opinions expressed in this article are strictly his own.,"The following article originally appeared in Institutional Crypto by CoinDesk, a free newsletter for the institutional market, with news and views on crypto infrastructure delivered every Tuesday. Sign up here.Issuers have submitted proposal after proposal for a bitcoin-based exchange-traded fund (ETF), and the SEC has delayed or rejected each one. It’s time, however, to ask why and if the SEC’s frustration over not having jurisdiction over cryptocurrencies is clouding their judgment. In my opinion, the answer might well be yes.To start, it is important to recognize that there is a lot of investor interest in bitcoin as well as other digital assets. Nothing the SEC can do will diminish that, so the only relevant question is if a bitcoin ETF meets the standards for such a product and is consistent with other approved ETFs. That said, the SEC argues that bitcoin, despite having multiple markets that meet a reasonable standard for displayed price discovery, does not meet that standard.From the disapproval ruling:“Because, among other things, the Sponsor has asserted that 95% of the bitcoin spot market consists of fake and non-economic activity, but has not established that it has in fact identified the “real” bitcoin market, or that the “real” bitcoin market is isolated from the fraudulent and manipulative activity, we find, in each case, that NYSE Arca has not met its burden to demonstrate that its proposal is consistent with the requirements of Exchange Act Section 6(b)(5), and therefore the Commission disapproves this proposed rule change.”This analysis has three main flaws: First, there are a number of bitcoin “exchanges” (1) that are subject to money center or trust bank regulation with transparent order books and matching methodologies. There is no proof of “fake” trades at those exchanges and they comprise enough liquidity to be meaningful for the purpose of price discovery, as will be discussed later.Second, ETFs have been approved for gold, silver and other precious metals where the underlying spot markets are demonstrably inferior to bitcoin. The precious metals spot market is almost completely negotiated. As a result, in the case of approved precious metals ETFs, the futures markets are the sole basis for price discovery of the ETF itself. Since there are now multiple regulated futures markets for bitcoin in the U.S., however, it is hard to understand the SEC’s logic in stating that there is insufficient price discovery from those futures markets.Delving into the comparison deeper, it is important to recognize that the SEC has approved ETFs for gold, silver, platinum, oil and other commodities whose spot market is much more opaque than the market for bitcoin and whose markets are also susceptible to manipulation.  Unlike gold, where spot prices are loosely provided on disconnected websites and transactions happen on a negotiated (almost completely manual) basis, bitcoin pricing is provided by many markets running electronically available order books that are subject to various regulators. As a result, the spot crypto markets are far more transparent than those of spot commodities, with far more liquidity available at tighter spreads.To put this into context, I checked several leading websites for buying or selling gold coins or rounds and the average spread between buying and selling was over 4%. It is certainly possible that for larger-sized orders that the spreads might have been smaller, but it seems unlikely to have been much tighter. That contrasts with a bid-offer spread, inclusive of retail exchange fees for bitcoin that average well under 1%, even for order sizes as large as 500-1000 bitcoin (larger than an ETF creation or redemption unit). For example, as I write this, the per-coin cost to buy 500 bitcoin across regulated exchanges, net of (retail level) fees, is $8,491 (calculated using CoinRoutes software), while the per-coin cost to sell 500, net of the same fees, is $8,438 (2). Using our patent-pending RealPrice mechanism, we could stream the price to redeem or create a full bitcoin ETF in real time, which is a level of transparency well beyond many underlying assets who have approved ETFs.The third flaw in the analysis is that there have been many allegations of manipulation related to other commodities that already have ETFs, so it seems like the SEC is holding bitcoin to a much higher standard. It is particularly ironic that the SEC cited the possibility of manipulation in the commodity, considering the recent RICO case against precious metals traders. We must recognize that there is always the potential for manipulation, but the question the SEC should ask is if bitcoin is more subject to such behavior and if its markets are harder to surveil than other approved underlying assets. Once again, the answer is no.  Bitcoin has multiple regulated futures markets in the U.S., giving the CFTC similar jurisdiction as they have in precious metals, and, unlike precious metals, the spot markets have significant electronic (and therefore auditable) data on buyers and sellers. These markets represent a critical mass of transparent, displayed liquidity, which should be the defining characteristic for this decision. It ensures that there would be available data for the CFTC to utilize when there are allegations of manipulation. Before concluding, I would like to make two other points. First, it should not matter if the SEC is skeptical about bitcoin, or if they are worried that it will go to zero. The agency should not be determining what investments are good or bad, but rather if the information made available to investors, including market data, is accurate and fairly provided.Second, despite the SEC’s insistence that it is protecting investors by rejecting these applications, the result is harmful. Retail investors that want to invest in bitcoin are driven towards fund products that have significant premiums to their net asset value. Such premiums could, of course, evaporate and hand investors larger losses than had they purchased an ETF. In addition, unsophisticated investors are using a variety of retail platforms to buy bitcoin that charge significantly higher fees or spreads that would likely be offered via an ETF, and feature weaker investor protection regulation by a wide margin.Finally, it is important to address the SEC’s contention that “fake” or manipulated markets outside of the U.S. represent a problem for a bitcoin ETF. This is simply wrong. The markets they reference can be excluded from calculations of available liquidity and price. In fact, many commodities trade at different prices in other parts of the world, but those prices are ignored by U.S.-issued ETFs.In conclusion, I believe that the SEC, perhaps due to its bias against the asset itself, is improperly delaying an ETF approval. Considering the availability of real-time, fully priced liquidity, using only markets that are regulated in the U.S., as well as the existence of multiple CFTC-regulated futures markets – the time is now.

The opinions expressed in this article are the author’s own.,"The following article originally appeared in Institutional Crypto by CoinDesk, a weekly newsletter focused on institutional investment in crypto assets. Sign up for free here. To find out more about crypto valuation metrics, download our free report here.Whether you call it the “halving” or the “halvening,” one of the few things we can be sure of in crypto is that the conversation around bitcoin’s upcoming reduction in mining reward will intensify over the next six months.Why? Because previous halvings have triggered bull runs. And who doesn’t like a bull run?Many are convinced that the next halving will have the same market effect, and it’s not just a belief that history repeats itself – models have emerged to support this theory.But if the bull run is expected, why hasn’t it already happened? Why isn’t the halving already priced in?Because the halving is much more than an event – it is also a narrative, and an uncertain one at that.First, a review of what the halving is and why it happens.To keep inflation under control, the bitcoin protocol was programmed with a hard limit of 21 million, with new bitcoins entering the system as an incentive for network processors (“miners”) in a gradual and controlled rhythm. The rate at which they are created is reduced by half every four years, ostensibly to mimic the increased difficulty of gold mining. On Nov. 28, 2012, the initial reward of 50 new bitcoins was halved to 25, and since July 9, 2016, miners have been receiving 12.5 bitcoins for each block successfully processed.The next reduction, after which the network incentives will be 6.25 bitcoins per block, is expected in May 2020.
(source: Digital Asset Research – statistical model, not price predictions)The above chart shows that the price (represented by the light blue line) started moving up before each of the previous halvings, and continued for some time after. Yet the data set is limited – the market has only experienced two of these events, and it could be a stretch to assume that the pattern will repeat itself.That’s where some fundamental supply/demand analysis comes in.Bitcoin investor and analyst Tuur Demeester recently pointed out that, for the cryptocurrency to maintain a price of over $8,000 until the next halving, the market would need to see $2.9 billion of investment inflow to offset the deflationary effect of new bitcoins entering the system. Even assuming investment growth remains constant, the reduction in selling pressure after the halving (with fewer new coins hitting the market) would lead to a price boost.Pseudonymous trader Plan B has gone a step further and used the stock-to-flow (S2F) ratio – which divides current inventory by annual production – to create a model that retroactively predicts past price movements for bitcoin with a high degree of accuracy, using gold and silver as benchmarks. This model predicts a bitcoin price of almost $60,000 after the next halving (the black line in the chart above).While this model has its critics, it has undergone rigorous cross-examination, and it seems that the regression holds up. It also makes intuitive sense: a reduction in supply should enhance value, all else being equal. So why isn’t the price already heading up to that lofty level?This is where narrative comes in.Technically, the halving isn’t a “fundamental” event, in that it does not represent a value driver in traditional investment terms. “Fundamental” in asset analysis refers to variable yet quantifiable features that can drive a valuation, such as profit, market size and balance sheet. In this sense, pre-programmed scarcity is not fundamental, it’s factual.We can hope that facts themselves are not open to interpretation, but their impact almost always is. No one doubts the halving will happen – yet the narrative around its influence is not clear.Let’s look at why.First, some argue that the halving is already priced in. The move from $3,300 to $12,000 earlier this year? That was it. The market is relatively efficient in terms of information distribution, the argument goes, so smart investors would obviously have incorporated the supply adjustment into their models and taken positions accordingly.Second, models tend to fit until they don’t. The bitcoin ecosystem today is arguably very different from previous halvings: four years ago, crypto derivatives markets were in their infancy, institutional involvement was slim and valuation frameworks were practically non-existent. It’s not unreasonable for investors to believe that “this time it’s different.”Some industry insiders have hinted that the halving could be negative if it reduces miners’ profitability and forces many of the smaller ones out of the market. True, this could be offset by a price increase, but if that turns out to not be proportional, increased network centralization could trigger concerns about security.Also, in traditional markets, price is rarely a function of supply. It’s more influenced by demand, which the S2F model does not take into account. In the absence of an established and widespread fundamental use case (for now), demand in crypto markets is narrative-driven.Yet in recursive logic, demand could be affected by the halving narrative. The widely held expectation that it will influence the price could stimulate demand for bitcoin as an investment asset, which will influence its price, especially as new investors – attracted by the supply models and historical correlation – enter the sector.And asymmetric risk comes into the picture: the chance that the models are wrong and I lose everything will have less of an impact on my portfolio than the possibility the models are right and I make a 500% return.So, even if the supply-driven models are trying to re-write traditional investing principles, it doesn’t mean that we won’t see a price rally.If that happens, the narrative will coalesce around the confirmation that the supply-based models were right, even if they weren’t the cause. We could end up with the head-spinning cycle of narrative influencing price, and price influencing narrative.Even so, this would not be the only head-spinning feature of the crypto markets over the coming months. The buzz around bitcoin’s supply schedule will highlight its unique economics, which in turn should awaken even more investor interest.If this leads to more inflows at a time when new supply falls, the charts that predict a post-halving rally will turn out to have been right all along.Then again, narratives can be fickle, and brave is the investor who assumes they’ll hold. They also rarely thrive in isolation – and, let’s face it, there are a lot of things going on out there that can have as great an influence on bitcoin’s price.Either way, it’s hard to deny that the emergence of forecasting models is a positive step that will help us understand market dynamics and bitcoin’s role in a broader financial market. Sophisticated investors will no doubt both welcome these and treat the underlying assumptions with a healthy dose of skepticism.Disclosure: the author holds small amounts of bitcoin and ether, with no short positions.Halved persimmon fruit image by Rodrigo Argenton via Wikimedia Commons"

U.S. stock market has put on a sterling show, as seen in the chart below.","Nov 20, 2019 at 11:24 UTC",Bitcoin is looking south after erasing three-quarters of the price rally seen in October. The bearish mood comes as the U.S. equities market is soaring in the opposite direction. ,"The top cryptocurrency by market cap is currently trading at $8,070 on Bitstamp, down 22 percent from the October high of $10,350. With the pullback, BTC has erased nearly 75 percent of the sudden surge from $7,293 to $10,350 witnessed in the two days to Oct. 26. Bitcoin's inability to capitalize on the breakout into five figures and the subsequent drop to $8,000 has been associated with the lack of positive catalysts. Moreover, prices had jumped above $10,000 reportedly on hopes that BTC, being a leading cryptocurrency, would benefit from China's push toward wide blockchain adoption. While bitcoin has dropped by more than $2,000 in the last 3.5-weeks, the U.S. stock market has put on a sterling show, as seen in the chart below. The S&P 500 index rose to a record high of 3127.6 on Tuesday, having found acceptance above the psychological resistance of $3,000 last week. Notably, the index has rallied for six straight weeks, possibly in response to the Federal Reserve's  expansion of its balance sheet, as suggested by popular analyst Sven Henrich/Northman Trader. The Fed has added more than $270 billion to its balance sheet since Sept. 11 and currently has around $4.04 trillion worth of assets, according to Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Fed Reserve Chairman Jeremy Powell has repeatedly said that the ongoing bond purchases are aimed at normalizing the money markets, which went ballistic in September and pushed the overnight rate as high as 10 percent. Analysts and investors, however, are of the opinion that the Fed has embarked on round four of the quantitative easing (QE) program, as discussed last month. Under a QE program, the central bank buys government bonds to infuse liquidity into the economy and lower interest rates to boost growth. Looking forward, the S&P 500 may trim recent gains in the short term, courtesy of renewed China-U.S. political tensions. China's foreign ministry on Wednesday threatened retaliation to the U.S. Senate's decision to pass legislation aimed at safeguarding human rights in Hong Kong amid a crackdown on the pro-democracy protest movement.The crypto market community believes BTC is a risk-off asset. The cryptocurrency, however, does not have a credible story as a haven asset, as recently pointed out by CoinDesk's Galen Moore, and may find little love amid the U.S.-China political tiff. That said, If China retaliates by devaluing the yuan (CNY) significantly, BTC may pick up a bid on hopes of increased demand from the world's second-largest economy. Such rallies, however, seldom last. For instance, BTC jumped 7 percent on Aug. 5 as CNY slipped beyond 7 per USD. The cryptocurrency, however, topped out above $12,300 on the following day and fell back to $9,400 by the end of August, even though CNY continued to slide and hit a multi-year low of 7.1842 on Sept. 3.Further, the technical charts indicate BTC could extend the recent decline to key support near $7,700.The series of lower highs and lower lows seen on the daily
chart indicate the path of least resistance is to the downside.The MACD histogram is printing deeper bars below the zero line, signaling a strengthening of bearish momentum. The 14-day relative strength index (RSI) is also reporting bearish conditions with a below-50 reading. The RSI on the three-day chart is also hovering below 50 and
the MACD histogram is teasing a bearish crossover below zero. BTC, therefore, looks set to test $7,850 – the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from $3,122 to $13,880.BTC has dropped to $8,000, as expected, having failed to hold on to gains above the descending (bearish) 10-month moving average (MA) earlier this month. Major support is now seen near $7,700 (ascending 10-day MA). The RSI on the 4-hour chart (not shown) is reporting oversold conditions. Hence, a minor bounce to $8,400 may be seen before a slide to $7,700.The short-term outlook would turn bullish if prices print a high-volume UTC close above the descending trendline hurdle on the daily chart , currently at $8,460.Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

and privately store. Sources in Lebanon and Iran said there is scant ...","Nov 21, 2019 at 17:50 UTC","In the face of censorship and isolation from their countries’ financial and communication systems, protesters across the globe are testing out bitcoin and other decentralized technologies – then promptly discovering their limitations. ","Take Hong Hong, for example, where protests began six months ago against China’s infringements on civil liberties and ramped up on Monday at Hong Kong Polytechnic University as police detained 1,000 protesters. The former British colony would seem the perfect test case for an open-access financial system resistant to government interference. But that may not yet bet the case.Take for example, HSBC Holdings reportedly shutting down the bank account of Spark Alliance HK, a local nonprofit focused on civic engagement, because it was associated with protests and the bank was allegedly pressured by Beijing. The move reminded protesters and donors of the need to transact privately, one protestor, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told CoinDesk. Nonprofits like HKMap Live and Hong Kong Free Press already accept bitcoin donations. However, the Hong Kong protester added, “there is no [internet] connection in the protest area, no matter which service provider you used,” and protesters are generally not clear on how bitcoin would be used by individuals during a time of civil unrest. It is mostly useful for receiving donations from abroad that don’t require prompt liquidity. Plus, he said protesters who tried mesh-network devices, which basically bounce a message or transaction across a web of devices until it finds a device with internet access, found they were “not useful for a confrontational situation.” Although many protesters use Telegram because it allows chatting without revealing the users’ phone numbers, he said tools that rely on mobile data providers offer limited functionality in times of turmoil.As with protests in the Middle East, sources in Hong Kong said bitcoin and related technologies are not ready for usage in chaotic environments because the movement is still nascent and money generally relies on network effects. At this point, censorship-resistant technology can still be censored as long as it remains too niche. “People are moving their money abroad more,” said one Chinese bitcoiner with family in Hong Kong, who asked that her name be withheld for safety. “But it’s from bank to bank, like Hong Kong accounts to Singapore.”She added it’s harder to get goods and services, including food imported from mainland China and physical cash, in part because 19 percent of Hong Kong bank branches were closed this week due to the chaos. Further complicating matters, online discourse in general has been further restricted as the protests rage on. Hong Kong’s High Court issued an interim injunction in October forbidding people from publishing or circulating information that promotes “the use or threat of violence … on any internet-based platform or medium.” Then on Monday, China’s mainland firewall banned the web browser Kuniao, which was often used to access global social media platforms.Meanwhile in Iran, Revolutionary Guard crackdowns on nationwide protests against rising gas prices and political corruption reportedly left 200 civilians dead and thousands injured. The Iranian government shut down global internet access for nearly five days (locally hosted websites and services are still operational), and only started to establish limited connectivity again on Thursday. One Tehran-based bitcoiner, who requested anonymity for safety, was arrested at a protest for taking photos then promptly released. Police searched his phone, including social chats, apps and photos, he said. So he now routinely deletes Twitter direct messages from other bitcoiners.This bitcoiner has a personal server abroad, and was able to jerry-rig limited internet access through it. According to Bitnodes, there are just six bitcoin nodes operating in Iran.“I made a secure encryption protocol between data centers and a mobile network,” he said. “I bypassed several servers and networks to reach the edge servers. … Now I have a 100Mbps connection.”Despite regaining some level of connectivity, he said his bitcoin wallet apps and mobile apps like Telegram are still blocked. It’s especially difficult for Iranians to access foreign servers and infrastructure because many companies ban Iranians for fear of U.S. sanctions. “We're locked up in a prison that the U.S. and Iranian governments have built for us,” he said, adding the Blockstream bitcoin satellite and mesh network technologies aren’t useful when you’re in a massive internet desert. “In situations where we don't have physical connection none of these fucking technologies help us,” he said.After all, even if he got a transaction through, there are too few tech-savvy recipients to make digital transactions a worthwhile use of his time.“We need a simple way to connect our devices together,” the anonymous protester said. “We need secure and accessible communication for people.” This point highlights yet another lesson learned by protestors in Lebanon: Black markets are vulnerable to infiltration from within. On Tuesday, Lebanese protesters took over Beirut's Nejmeh Square and stopped parliament from meeting, spurred by a local banking crisis and government corruption. Lebanese bitcoin trades, predominantly facilitated through WhatsApp, Telegram and Facebook, continue normally with a slight premium. Trading is hampered, according to such group chats, by limited cash access from local banks and financial institutions. After a week of shuttering branches, the banks reopened this week with a $1,000 withdrawal limit. On Thursday, protesters reportedly entered the central bank to demonstrate that these measures are perceived as the government doing too little, too late to quell the currency crisis. As one anonymous bitcoin trader said: “There’s no access to liquidity.”Two weeks ago, a few bitcoin traders found hackers had accessed their mobile phones and stolen cryptocurrency. Local social groups brimmed with concerns about which anonymous trader accounts could be trusted. As reported by the local outlet VDL News, the alleged hacker may have knowledge of the victims’ location and access to a network run by the telecommunications company Touch, because the hack involved intercepting messages at the service level. (Two exchanges associated with the alleged victims denied any hack to their systems on this date.)“They can hijack WhatsApp, Telegram [accounts],” one alleged hacking victim said. “That means you can’t trust your mobile identity. … They [hackers] can create trouble between parties, fake accounts and impersonation.”So this hack served as a wake-up call to the local community. In short, there is no substitute for in-person networking and long-standing relationships. Without them, the privacy created by avatars is also a liability.  In all three contexts, current bitcoin infrastructure was found to be insufficient. While this may be expected of a nascent technology, across user groups the common need was for accessibility.Both the Chinese and Iranian bitcoiners who spoke to CoinDesk pointed out that most people don’t have the skills, nor the desire, to go “the anarchist route,” as the Chinese bitcoiner put it. The Hong Kong protester added that “most protesters don’t know how to make use of bitcoin in this [activist] context.”When it’s available, Hong Kong civilians still rely on traditional financial institutions, the Chinese bitcoiner said. LocalBitcoins data on peer-to-peer bitcoin trades in Hong Kong and Iran don’t show any relative spikes, reflecting the same narrative from over-the-counter Lebansese traders. Many bitcoiners prefer to stay deep underground these days, another Tehran-based bitcoiner said, fearful of attracting the attention of authorities on the hunt for people to suspect and arrest. Scattered and fragmented communities offer scant liquidity on the ground. Broader adoption leads to better usability and privacy, even if only by helping bitcoiners get lost in the crowd. After all, if bitcoin were more popular in Tehran then users might not fear that usage would attract attention. A third anonymous Iranian source, currently abroad yet deeply involved with the Tehran bitcoin community, said there is a significant legal threat to locals helping neighbors bypass internet censorship. “People who have servers (hosting websites, etc) in Iran have received SMS mentioning that hosting, selling or distributing any VPN service or proxy in order to access filtered websites (such as Telegram) is illegal … encouraging them to tell on those that are doing so,” he said. “BTS tower SMS-CB technology has been used to send SMS to people in certain areas to leave.”In these cases, bitcoin has proven most useful to store wealth or receive funds from abroad. Transacting locally is risky. One Lebanses bitcoiner who thwarted a hacker said that luckily he stores half of his savings in a bitcoin hardware wallet, which kept it safe. “I find it ironic that the first world talks about how bitcoin is freedom to the unbanked, but the unbanked have no way to get bitcoin,” he said. “Bitcoin feels like a novelty at times, or a privilege.” In fact, Lebanese entrepreneur Dany Moussa told CoinDesk his homeland is predominantly a cash society, so even credit and debit cards might have a learning curve for some. It should also be noted that chatter in Lebanese groups shows hardware wallets don’t always work as designed, so users often need to help each other fix them.“I think we are still far from serious adoption of crypto in Lebanon for many reasons,” Moussa said. “Lebanese [people] do not have access to exchanges due to restrictions adopted by [Lebanon’s central bank] and lack of coverage from [outside] exchanges.”When global crypto exchanges and service providers ban a population due to sanctions or compliance concerns, as they have with Iranians and Lebanese people to some extent, ties to global communities can provide a lifeline. Across the board, sources said that connectivity and accessibility on the ground were the two fundamental challenges. Money is, after all, primarily a social construct. The dream of a lone anarchist striking out only works if his goal is to flee, not stay. “Consider two or three people who can communicate with the Blockstream satellites, what would be the benefit [of using bitcoin]?” the Tehran-based bitcoiner said. “Not all people are hackers and network experts. … When we talk about a payment network it must have a significant number of members.”Hong Kong protest image via ShutterstockThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The price is still more than double where it started 2018, making bitcoin one of the world's best-performing assets. Bitcoin's price surged in late October after Chinese President Xi Jinping said the country planned to embrace the blockchain – the type of decentralized computer-programming network that underpins cryptocurrencies – as a core technology. Many traders and investors speculated at the time that bitcoin, as the oldest cryptocurrency and the largest by market value, stood to benefit from the new push by the world's second-largest economy. But according to Joe DiPasquale, CEO of the cryptocurrency hedge-fund firm BitBull Capital, there haven't been enough developments since then to create additional enthusiasm among traders and investors. Bitcoin had traded for several weeks in a range between $9,100 and $9,600, so a recent move below that level may have spurred some traders to sell, exacerbating the price drop. Trading volumes also have been unusually low recently, he said. ""We expect for there to be some investors taking profit after these big newsworthy spikes,"" DiPasquale said in a phone interview. Market signals suggest the price is likely to find support at $8,100, DiPasquale said, and if it fell below that level, the cryptocurrency would probably drop further, toward $7,400. In the longer term, DiPasquale said, there is a bullish case for bitcoin due to the so-called ""halving"" expected in May 2020 – when rewards for mining new blocks of transactions will be cut in half, essentially reducing the supply of new units of the cryptocurrency.If the price jumps back above $9,000, he said, bitcoin would then probably head back toward $10,000, DiPasquale said.  Prices for the cryptocurrency are still well off their year-to-date high around $13,000 reached in late June. The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The Nov. 18 notice actually references a letter from the SEC’s commissioners dated Oct. 15. It is not clear what triggered the SEC’s review. Under current federal law, the commissioners can grant a review at their discretion, or following the filing of a petition.The order rejecting the proposal will remain in effect until the review has concluded, the notice said, with the commissioners either upholding the staff rejection or overturning it. As part of the review, the general public can comment on the rejection through Dec. 18, 2019.Unlike the SEC’s formal approval or disapproval process, there are no set deadlines for the review of a decision. The Commission has previously reviewed the rejection of a bitcoin ETF proposal filed by the family office of Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, ultimately upholding the decision after more than a year.It is possible that an SEC commissioner may have called for the Bitwise review. Famously, Commissioner Hester Peirce – dubbed “Crypto Mom” by the community – announced the review of nine rejected bitcoin ETF applications in 2018. Peirce also dissented from the SEC’s second rejection of the Winklevoss ETF.The ETF applications, filed in late 2017 and early 2018 by GraniteShares, ProShares and Direxion, were rejected in August 2018, with Peirce announcing their review the next day. However, it remains unclear what the status of this review is, or whether any of these decisions will be overturned.Neither Peirce nor an SEC spokesperson immediately responded to emailed requests for comment. ProShares declined to comment, and a request for comment to Direxion was not returned by press time. GraniteShares CEO Will Rhind told CoinDesk in a phone call that nothing had come of the SEC’s review so far, and he did not expect this to change in the near future.“I think [SEC Chairman Jay Clayton] has spoken publicly about the ETF applications and … he’s made it clear at least from the top that the market has to mature a little bit before there’ll be an approval,” he said.Matthew Hougan image by Joe Jenkins for CoinDeskThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Pantera Capital, Galaxy Digital and Tagomi have already signed on as initial customers for “Bakkt Warehouse,” with other “marquee firms” expected to join over the next few weeks.When it first launched, Bakkt was only able to provide custody services to clients trading its bitcoin futures contracts. Monday’s news comes amid an additional approval by the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), which previously granted the company a trust charter.In a blog post, Bakkt COO Adam White wrote that “a critical link … in the institutional adoption of bitcoin is custody.”“When investors have ready access to regulated custodians whose security and processes they trust, the full potential of this emerging asset class and technology can flourish,” he wrote, adding:“While technology provides the foundation by which we securely store customer funds, the Bakkt Warehouse employs extensive physical, operational and cybersecurity safeguards too. Our relationship with Intercontinental Exchange (NYSE: ICE), a Fortune 500 company that owns and operates the market infrastructure upon which the world’s largest financial institutions already rely, enables us to uniquely address client needs in the digital asset custody space.”Bakkt employs a number of safeguards and security features, including “dedicated network connectivity between operational sites,” redundant secondary facilities, geographically-distributed signing operations, independent reporting structures and a number of other features, White claimed.There’s also “24×7 video monitoring, armed guards and security operations and incident response teams,” the post stated.Bakkt has mentioned a number of these features before. The company is working with BNY Mellon to support its geographically separated key storage feature, according to a late August blog post.While Bakkt had already secured insurance for up to $100 million in assets prior to its futures launch in September, the company announced Monday that “a leading global syndicate of insurers” is now providing it with a $125 million policy.Bakkt’s announcement Monday comes just weeks after the company said it would begin offering options on top of its existing bitcoin futures contracts, which in turn came less than a month after the company went live with its long-anticipated physically delivered offerings. The company has since announced it is developing a consumer app for users to purchase goods with bitcoin, starting with Starbucks, with a release date in the first half of 2020.While a number of other companies are developing their own platforms for physically-settled bitcoin futures in the U.S., Bakkt has been the only one to launch so far.CME Group, which has offered cash-settled bitcoin futures since December 2017 – meaning customers receive the fiat equivalent to the contract’s value at expiration, rather than the actual bitcoin – also announced its intention to add options contracts on top of its futures recently.The new products speak to a growing interest in bitcoin as an asset class from custodians, the companies have said.“At Bakkt, we’re committed to expanding access to the global economy by building trust in and unlocking the value of digital assets,” White wrote Monday.“The secure custody of digital assets is foundational to that mission and our solutions for customers. Whether it’s creating the first regulated market for the price discovery of bitcoin, or developing platforms that allow merchants and consumers to seamlessly interact using digital assets, custody is at the core of everything we do.”CoinDesk’s Michael Casey, Bakkt CEO Kelly Loeffler and ICE chairman Jeffrey Sprecher image via CoinDesk archives"

The contracts are sized at one bitcoin and settled in U.S. dollars. “Our new cash settled futures contract will offer investors in Asia and around the world a convenient, capital efficient way to gain or hedge exposure in bitcoin markets,” said Lucas Schmeddes, president and COO of ICE Futures and Clear Singapore.Bakkt said as recently as CoinDesk's Invest: NY event earlier this month that it planned to offer cash-settled futures in Singapore. The ICE subsidiary also revealed on Oct. 24 that it would “launch the first regulated options contract for bitcoin futures,” also on Dec. 9, and expanded its bitcoin custody offering beyond futures clients to wider institutional clients on Nov. 11. Galaxy Digital became one of the first clients this week, tapping Bakkt and Fidelity Digital Assets to store the bitcoin for two new funds.This week, MAS said it was seeking to green-light cryptocurrency derivatives on regulated platforms and was seeking feedback via a consultation paper.

Once the dust starts to settle on that, it’s going to be clear who’s been swimming naked.”Some altcoin could also make it into Arcane’s portfolio, Wall hinted, but only those strictly selected:“We are seeing a maturing trend in the altcoin market. It’s already very different now than it was a few years ago. It’s becoming harder and harder for technically inept projects to fake-it-til-you-make-it. There’s only in a very few, select areas in the cryptocurrency design space that has merit to compete against bitcoin.”Rather than measuring performance against fiat, the goal is to trade digital currencies to increase the size of the portfolio, in bitcoin.Arcane Crypto was founded by Norwegian investors Ketil Skorstad and Kristian G. Lundqvist, and also funded by Morten Klein, a poker player and chairman of the Swedish casinos company Cherry, in an undisclosed round this April.All three investors are from Norway, hence the Scandinavian slant of the fund.Wall had spent more than three years at Cinnober, a company selling tech solutions for stock and crypto exchanges, and was used to explaining crypto to people in traditional finance, but in English, not in Norwegian“We will have a special focus on the Nordics, but it’s not exclusive,” Wall added.Photo of Eric Wall by Enid Valu for the Lightning Conference"

I’m your host Nolan Bauerle. Both the podcast and the event explore the intersection of bitcoin and the global macroeconomy with perspectives from some of the leaders thinkers in finance, crypto, and beyond.Nolan Bauerle: (00:29)I’m delighted to be joined today by Meltem Demirors, one of the most famous people in crypto, that’s for sure. Meltem has been around for a long time, but really sprung to international prominence with her amazing testimony in a Congress Committee this past summer on the whole Libra offering. The people who have been working in cryptocurrencies for a long time have always been aware of Meltem’s brilliance, and she’s been kind enough to join us for today’s podcast.Nolan Bauerle: (01:05)This podcast is really trying to look at bitcoin’s place in the world today, and is a taste of the type of content that we’re going to be focusing on in New York City on November the 12th at Invest. So Meltem, thank you for joining me.Meltem Demirors: (01:21)Thank you so much for having me, Nolan. That was such a beautiful intro. I feel like I’d love to have you intro me all the time.Nolan Bauerle: (01:32)[inaudible 00:01:32]. I have had the good fortune of knowing you for quite a while now.Meltem Demirors: (01:35)I know. We met a long time ago.Nolan Bauerle: (01:37)And watching you gather up all this ability to sort of let your ideas shine on the global stage has been a real treat, and I’m happy to have even met you on the train back from Washington that day.Meltem Demirors: (01:49)That’s right. I think I was enjoying a Bud Light.Nolan Bauerle: (01:57)You definitely earned it. You definitely earned it. So let’s jump right in. We’re talking about bitcoin in the world today, and the first question I have really is around whether or not you see bitcoin as a true macro asset? Is it there? Is it in the main stage? Is it in the side stage somewhere? Is it in the wings? Or is this really something that can be thought of as the macro today?Meltem Demirors: (02:19)I think for most people in the world right now, particularly in the world of investing and finance, bitcoin and crypto assets are not yet an asset they think about. It’s a very small asset class. It’s around 200 to 250 billion right now. That’s very small, and so for most investors looking to allocate capital moving even 5 to 10 million dollars into the coin creates a lot of price movement, and there are not really efficient ways to do that today. So that’s one concern I think certainly.Meltem Demirors: (02:55)I think the other piece to think about just on a macro level that’s really relevant is macro investors sort of define the world in the context of specific assets in markets, and so I think as an investor you look at sovereign debt, and you look at debt generally as an asset class, corporate debt funds, you look at equities, and then a lot of people like to lump crypto under the alternatives category. Alternatives is sort of a growing part of the investment world, and I think it’s challenging for a lot of investors, even in the alternative space, to really try to figure out where bitcoin fits in.Meltem Demirors: (03:38)And so, I think the big challenge is to people in our industry, we like to talk about bitcoin as an asset class, because we live, breath, eat, sleep crypto all day every day, and certainly in our little part of the world bitcoin feels like the big asset, but I think frankly to most investors bitcoin’s not really on their consciousness, and if it is it’s far too early, and if anything the place are getting exposure if through their PA or personal account, certainly not through their firm, or their fund, and I don’t think that’s going to change in the near future, and we can talk about that more as well.Nolan Bauerle: (04:20)So in practice what you’re saying is it’s not quite there yet. If it was in this sort of macro level the features that would define it, the aspect of it that would sort of propel it forward, I think we can even trace to some of your testimony back in Washington in July. In that testimony, I think what we saw was you had Facebook, which was almost threatening, not a nation-state, but it was taking on certain powers. It was taking on certain responsibilities that we would normally prescribe to a nation-state, and it was saying we’re going to issue this private money, that, of course, got everyone’s back up.Nolan Bauerle: (04:58)I think one of the things that was remarkable about your testimony is you showed that bitcoin didn’t propose these same challenges, yet it is coherently creating what amounts to a digital jurisdiction at the same time, and is perhaps is at the foundation for this type of macro asset going forward, the foundation for what could amount to an important money supply, a hard money supply.Meltem Demirors: (05:25)Let’s untangle that a bit. So I think what’s challenging when we talk about bitcoin is unlike debt or equities bitcoin represents three different things. Bitcoin is technology in the context of the bitcoin protocol, which is open-source code, and open-source software has been a part of our world for a long time, and open source is I think starting to gain acceptance as an investible category in the venture world and beyond. And so, bitcoin at its core is the bitcoin protocol.Meltem Demirors: (05:56)Bitcoin is a network and what’s interesting here is bitcoin is kind of a supranational global communication network, and so there are tens of thousands of devices around the world, whether people are running minors, or people are just running full nodes there’s this network of computational devices that are maintaining the bitcoin ledger, and engaging the invalidating transactions, and maintaining the integrity of the ledger, and so the bitcoin network is physical in nature.Meltem Demirors: (06:26)And then, lastly, you have bitcoin the asset. And so, what I think is interesting here is for traditional investors it’s sort of a challenging paradigm when these three things are wrapped together, so when you see people look at bitcoin they’ll talk about bitcoins in the context of software infrastructure. You’ll hear people talking about bitcoin in the context of a commodity because it’s produced in its mind digitally in the way that we sort of think about producing and mining things like gold, and oil, that are limited in supply theoretically.Meltem Demirors: (06:57)And then, you have people talking about it in the context of currency, of hard money. What I think is interesting about Libra is Libra styles itself as a cryptocurrency, but really the point I was trying to make in Congress is anyone can call anything a cryptocurrency but that does not make it so. What’s interesting about bitcoin is unlike a commodity, unlike a bond, unlike an equity bitcoin is packed by nothing but the demand for it.Meltem Demirors: (07:25)And so, it’s a little bit unique in that regard. It has no physicality, which I think is part of the larger conversation about the evolution from highly physical to where we increasingly engage digitally. So that’s difficult for people to grasp. It doesn’t necessarily fit into the constructs we have for assets in our world, even assets that have been dematerialized part in like stocks that trade, you know, they still have a physical share certificate that’s somewhere.Meltem Demirors: (07:53)And then, I think the other component that’s interesting is when we look at what Libra is comprised of, and what it proposes to do, it’s really just a pooled investment vehicle where the interest in the fees accrue to the association. And so, I think it’s an interesting series of choices made by Facebook. I’m not really clear as to why they felt this was the best approach, but I think if you look at the intent of Libra it’s a pool of capital. You’re taking money from people who purchase the tokens, you’re putting it into currencies, and interest-bearing instruments, and we’re holding it, and then we’re distributing that plus transaction fees to people who participate in this private closed sort of group called the Libra Association.Meltem Demirors: (08:37)And so, to me, that’s sort of the antithesis of bitcoin. So my only goal really in the testimony was to help clarify that bitcoin is not Libra, bitcoin is separate and distinct from every other cryptocurrency and it has features that make it incredibly unique. And Libra, and many things, are in fact not cryptocurrencies. There’s a lot of ambiguity in language but certainly having specificity in how we use these terms is starting to become more and more important, particularly for regulators, policy makers, who are trying to understand what’s happening, but sometimes the translation they’re getting isn’t particularly helpful, and in fact can be more confusing than not.Nolan Bauerle: (09:19)So I want to pick up on two things that you said, and you said that Libra’s, of course, this pool investment, so the incentives of all these parties are definitely for protection fees, but you also mentioned that because bitcoin is only backed by the demand of the user that it really can exist as an uncorrelated asset, because Libra would theoretically be involved in all the ups and downs of a typical economy because the value of bitcoin is only really based on the demand that users and people have for it. Can it behave as a safe-haven asset?Meltem Demirors: (09:59)I think the idea of a safe haven is an interesting conversation. I think the way people typically frame this is this risk-on or risk-off asset. And I think the challenge with safe haven is again everything’s relative, so if I live in the United States, and I have US dollars, and I have a driver’s license, and I have a bank account, and a debit card I probably don’t view bitcoin as a safe haven asset, because the dollar’s pretty safe for me, and I’m able to do everything I want, and I don’t necessarily in times of crisis feel that the dollar depreciates rapidly, and so my purchasing power parody, my PP, stays intact.Meltem Demirors: (10:42)Now, conversely if I live in a part of the world where there is a lot of instability, and volatility, now I’m from Turkey personally, I was just there, and speaking to people about bitcoin, I think within the bitcoin community there’s this idea that people who live in regimes or parts of the world where their purchasing power parody, or their ability to buy the same basket of goods fluctuates a lot, because of the fluctuations and the value of their local currency. I think in our community we like to believe that they’re just going to rush to adopt bitcoin, and go out, and hold bitcoin.Meltem Demirors: (11:17)What’s really funny is if you actually go out and talk to people they don’t want to hold bitcoin they want US dollars. And so, this is where I think some of the challenge emerges in explaining a new asset class, and also really understanding some of the macroeconomic shifts happening in our world. We live in a dollar-denominated world today, and at the end of the day you can’t yet pay your rent, or your taxes, or your employees, or for your groceries in bitcoin, and I think someday you’ll be able to, and there’s certainly a number of companies I’ve invested in, and worked with, and support that are enabling people to do that, but I think again for your average person who’s living in a part of the world where they don’t have stability in their currency I think they’re not necessarily thinking of bitcoin as the solution, it’s maybe one part of the solution.Meltem Demirors: (12:12)I think right now they’re looking more at things like the dollar, and unfortunately, I think it’s going to take some time for the world to get to a point where bitcoin achieves that status in a larger sort of way. I think to us in the bitcoin community we certainly like to pontificate about what hyper bitcoinization will look like, and what a world will look like if people start holding bitcoin as a safe haven asset, but I just don’t think that narrative on a global scale has gotten there yet, and I think again part of the challenge there is how you communicate something that is so new, and a lot of people ask who’s the CEO of bitcoin, what’s stopping bitcoin, and so explaining this it’s really a fundamental shift in mental model and how people think. It’s a shift in trust instead of trusting an institution, or company, or a brand, you’re trusting an idea, and a set of principles.Meltem Demirors: (13:11)And so, that in my view is going to take some time, and it’s going to take the technology being developed, it’s going to take the on and off-ramps being developed, it’s going to take the user experience putting it a little easier, but most importantly it’s going to take some hard work from our community to translate a lot of the topics we talk about into things that people are actually thinking about on a day-to-day basis.Nolan Bauerle: (13:36)And so, your recent experience in Turkey did it strengthen your idea what it wasn’t quite there yet, but there was this work to do, or did it actually bring you out of a state of let’s say being disconnected, and sitting in one of these bitcoin ivory towers saying this is what bitcoinization is going to look like, and all that stuff, or was this just you’ve been enough times, you’ve seen it in this context, and you know that people just aren’t ready, and even if we are seeing some increased trade flows out of Turkey on local bitcoins it really is still isolated individuals and it’s not enough of a wave to really push the needle?Meltem Demirors: (14:13)So let’s talk about that. I think first and foremost I feel like I’ve tried to constantly force myself to step outside the bitcoin world, and interact with people who come from a totally different perspective, totally different viewpoint. I think the context is really important, especially when one of your functions is serving as a translator. I sometimes feel like my role is I’m a translator between two very different worlds, and so we have these crazy bitcoiners over here, and I’m certainly a part of that community, but at the same time I’m also communicating with a very different audience who has the potential to really shape and influence the trajectory of bitcoin as a technology, as an infrastructure, and as an asset in very material ways, and so I think it’s very important for me to be aware of all of the different perspectives and viewpoints in order to be an effective translator, and I do wish we did that more.Meltem Demirors: (15:12)I think hopefully that’s starting, but we’ll see. When it comes to Turkey, so Turkey’s interesting because ING the bank releases this study every year, this is the second year they’re done it. They just released it in October of this year, and what they look at is rates of digital currency adoption in different parts of the world, and Turkey ranks number one. And so, a lot of people are like oh yeah people in Turkey want to hold bitcoin because the lira is unstable, and that’s an attractive narrative, but the reality actually is that Turkey is a place where people are already accustomed to trading FOREX.Meltem Demirors: (15:50)People like speculative trading. I’m a Turk myself so we have that cultural acceptance for speculation. And so, FOREX trading, currency trading, is something a lot of people engage in. You have a population that’s already accustomed to digital banking because when banking services came to Turkey they kind of leapfrogged the ’80s and ’90s and it sort of went direct to digital. And then, you have a high population of young people who are really interested in the technology, and what they’re doing is they’re speculating on bitcoin.Meltem Demirors: (16:26)And I think that’s certainly exciting, but I think the narrative that people have isn’t, oh, I want to protect myself from price fluctuation in the lira, and certainly if you look at their experience over the last year even though the lira depreciated dramatically had they bought bitcoin when that happened, or before that happened, they would’ve lost more holding bitcoin. And so, I think again it’s important to be careful with these narratives because it’s very easy to overgeneralize, and I don’t think we’re quite at that point yet.Nolan Bauerle: (16:56)So you’re saying the simple argument holds, they just want to make money like anybody else.Meltem Demirors: (17:01)And look, I think through that process I actually think speculation is one of the great drivers of bitcoin adoption, because as people start to speculate, and as people start to interact with bitcoin they start to appreciate some of the principles and social values, what it represents, and I think that leads to people holding bitcoin longer, and viewing it more and more in the context of a form of sound digital money, but I do think we get a little bit overly excited about narratives that aren’t really quite supported by the evidence yet.Meltem Demirors: (17:38)Now, the good thing is I do think the bitcoin community’s doing more diligent research. Cambridge in the UK releases their annual study on bitcoin and blockchain adoption. ING, which is a global bank, is now doing their report. The coverage and the research methodology keeps getting better and better. And within the crypto space there’s also a number of new research firms that are starting to parse data in different ways to try to analyze, and provide more context, and insight as to what the actual growth metrics might look like, but I think as I travel around the world and interact with people all over the world that story just isn’t there yet.Nolan Bauerle: (18:16)And so, going back to what you had mentioned about bitcoin presenting these opportunities for people to learn, and let’s say inform their worldview, one sort of test that I’ve had for a long time about someone’s world view is how accurately it can predict the future. A lot of bitcoin people have been saying we anticipate a global recession because of sovereign debt, and all these other factors. When we look around the world today we certainly see some of the things that people who have been in bitcoin as long as yourself have been predicting for some time. What we’re not seeing, for example, recently in the United States not a recession, but we have seen let’s say liquidity crunch with the repo news.Nolan Bauerle: (19:00)But bitcoin hasn’t behaved in the way that most people had predicted according to these narratives, these narratives that sort of said if we have another round of quantitative easing in America you’re going to see a lot of demand for bitcoin in America. The wider question being the following, what happens to bitcoin in a recession? Is it going to be this asset that you can use to get out of these little ups and downs around the world as many people have predicted for years now, or is it going to become more and more correlated and the demand will go down just because there isn’t as much liquidity in general?Meltem Demirors: (19:35)I think this topic is an interesting one, and certainly, it’s very tempting for people to buy into the recession narrative. After all, we are in the longest bull run in market history. We’re not at 10 years and three months, and counting. And look, I think the fact of the matter is the financial system is changing. There’re certain beliefs we’re had for a long time about how markets should work, and how investing should work, and we’re not seeing a lot of those beliefs we had being proven false.Meltem Demirors: (20:11)You look at just the sheer volume of negative-yielding debt. I mean, that’s a bit mind-boggling. The numbers just don’t make sense. You look at what’s happening in the passive investing space. When you look at the challenges that many hedge funds are facing, and generating meaningful alpha, through active management. They’re just a lot of challenges that the financial markets are facing, that investors are facing, but I don’t think that points naturally to we are in for a recession, because at the end of the day capital continues to flow, we are continuing to see people continuing to move out on the risk curve investing in high-risk venture investing, more and more capital being deployed there.Meltem Demirors: (20:57)Alternatives continue to grow as an asset class. So I think this narrative of a recession is coming is a tempting one, but I think it’s one that’s sort of difficult to predict. I’m not really in the business of reading teal leaves if you will. What I think is more interesting to think about, and one thing we’ve never seen in how bitcoin behaves in a recession, right? Because bitcoin was introduced to the world in 2009 after the 2008 financial crisis, the bitcoin network launch, and so we’ve never seen it in an environment like a recession.Meltem Demirors: (21:32)And so, I think there are a lot of what I like to call unknown unknowns about what will happen when we enter that new time. And I think again the forces shaping our world and the forces shaping the financial system there are some known unknowns, but then I feel like a lot of investors I talk to feel like they’re facing a lot of unknown unknowns, and so there are a lot of open questions about what the world will look like in this new era. It does feel like we’re in a new stage of financial markets. Some people call this late-stage capitalism. Some people look to Japan as an example of what might happen.Meltem Demirors: (22:11)But again, I think my job really is trying to focus on what this means for bitcoin, and really trying to manage the ups and downs of what’s happening with bitcoin and crypto assets, and put it in context for investors who are looking at the world feeling very confused, looking at bitcoin saying no way, this is too much, there’s so much other stuff going on in my world that I don’t need to add more risk, and add so much uncertainty by adding a highly volatile, poorly understood asset, that I just fundamentally don’t get yet.Nolan Bauerle: (22:45)Yeah, so it’s basically that perhaps we’re living in an era of unlimited leverage for now, which makes basically everything funded including bitcoin, and all the ICOs, and all the crazy projects. What happens if that funding just isn’t there anymore? Does bitcoin still stand up on its own, or is it a product all this free money all around the world that’s just looking for risk? As you mentioned, appetites for risk are growing just because there is so much leverage out there that you can take in going.Meltem Demirors: (23:16)The hunt for yield, right? There is a hunt for yield because ultimately what we’re relying on here in the US, and in many other Western developed economies, we have a population that is retiring, and pensions are underfunded. There are all of these social liabilities that need to get paid for, and historically the way we’re paid for them is through the compounding of interest, and through yield, and when that stops working the only other alternatives is to extract it sort of from society through taxation, or through inflation, right?Meltem Demirors: (23:51)And we’re seeing that effect around the world. You look at what’s happening in Chile, you look at what’s happening in Argentina, you look at what’s happening in Hong Kong, you look at what’s happening in the UK. There’s only so much you can squeeze that out of a system, so I think there’re a lot of fundamental existential questions about the relevance of nation-states, the relevance of currencies generally, and what I think is so interesting about bitcoin if we leave aside sort of the price of bitcoin, and these arguments around bitcoin as sound money, and these things that are very exciting, I think what’s even more interesting is the questions that bitcoin introduces to the conversation.Meltem Demirors: (24:33)So when people first learn about bitcoin I think it opens their mind to the idea that there is a different choice, because we’ve never really contemplated a world where I could hold something other than government-issued currency, and so that to me is the more interesting, and more profound question, and now of course with China announcing the digital renminbi with a lot of US corporations including Facebook looking at getting involved in the currency game in different ways, or in the cryptocurrency game, or other versions of digitized dollar, or digitized store value, I think it starts to get really interesting.Nolan Bauerle: (25:12)Meltem, you’ve always enjoyed a real tremendous bird’s eye view of the industry in your time with DCG and now with CoinShares. You’re really someone who’s able to not just be in touch with the sort of grassroots of the industry but also the more sophisticated investors, buyers, all of those folks. Have you seen a change from their perspective in the last six months around bitcoin in what they’re looking for, the questions they’re asking, and what they’re interested in?Meltem Demirors: (25:43)Yeah. Absolutely. I think people are certainly getting smarter faster. I think a part of what’s so amazing about the bitcoin community is just the extremely high level of quality content that’s out there, that’s produced by members of the community, for free, is easily available online, on Twitter, on people’s websites, on blogs, and podcasts. There’s just a real wealth of content information, knowledge being created to share, disseminated, expanded on, which I think is really exciting, and people are responding to that, and people are certainly reading that, and reacting to it.Meltem Demirors: (26:23)And so, I think people are starting to gain more of an appreciation for, an understanding, of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, but at the same time I think there’s also more confusion than ever, and unfortunately there’re a lot of people who look to bitcoin’s success and attempt to use it as a way to substantiate whatever their project is, and we saw a lot of this with the ICOs of 2017 and 2018. Everyone wanted to build a better, greener, faster, more scalable bitcoin, name your favorite feature here. I like to call this the era of future fetish in blockchains.Meltem Demirors: (27:01)But I think there are so many things about bitcoin that can’t be replicated, but what you get is you get a bunch of people in the market who are spreading their own narratives around what bitcoin is and why their asset or their project is different, or better, and I think that market confusion is now being reflected at the government level where we see a lot of conversation around central bank-issued digital currency, a lot of fundamental misunderstandings about how bitcoin works, even in US Congress. I think there was this perception from some of our congressman and congresswoman that bitcoin was unregulated, and I think again the confusion there is yes as a protocol there is no regulation around bitcoin, but if you operate a bitcoin company, and you’re domiciled in the US, or you touch a US customers your subject to the rules and regulations of this nation, and there are a lot of rules and regulations from every agency out there going from the CFTC, to the IRS, to FinCEN.Meltem Demirors: (27:59)So this sort of notion that bitcoin’s unregulated I think is just a misunderstanding, and I think the media’s also played a big part in that, in perpetuating some of the sensationalism of what’s happening here, and so, unfortunately, there are these series of narratives that have defined bitcoin for the last 10 years of its existence. I think they’re starting to die down and fade a bit, but I think that’s just a really strong inertia that we as the bitcoin community need to overcome.Meltem Demirors: (28:32)And unfortunately, we have not done a very good job with storytelling, and with grasping the why. It still feels like it’s stuck in a bit of an echo chamber, and so I’m really hopeful that as more, and more people start to understand bitcoin, start to get interested in bitcoin, and in digital currencies, and they go out there, and they educate themselves whether it’s going through events, like Consensus: Invest, or whether it’s listening to podcasts, or reading blogs that they’ll start to piece together their own view of the world, but I guess that’s one of the challenges of having no leader, and essential coordinator, and no marketing body for bitcoin.Nolan Bauerle: (29:12)I like the comment you made about that future fetish, because some of it comes up. People will say well what if there’s a better bitcoin? Well, this isn’t Nintendo. It’s not consumer electronics. This is something different. This is cryptography and it develops at a different pace than Nintendo or video games. Just because something is newer doesn’t mean it’s more useful, and will sell at a fixed sum feature.Meltem Demirors: (29:34)Right.Nolan Bauerle: (29:34)The very idea that people have accepted demand for this secure network that in many ways is already the most secure network in the world, depending on your basis, or your metrics, you know, here it is. It’s about the buy-in, you know? Not the same as consumer technology.Meltem Demirors: (29:54)Yeah, and I think when people talk about features a lot of the common complaints you hear about bitcoin are either around technical features, or certain aspects of bitcoin, and I think it sort of misses the point. Yes, bitcoin is technology. Yes, bitcoin is infrastructure, it’s communication infrastructure, but we communicate about value, and we can also communicate other types of information. And yes, bitcoin is about money. But at the end of the day I think bitcoin more than anything else represents a social movement and a set of ideas, and I know that sounds very esoteric, and a bit philosophical, but I think what a lot of people are starting to grasp as they go down the proverbial bitcoin rabbit hole, and I love that we call it a rabbit hole, because it’s such a strong reference to the movie The Matrix.Meltem Demirors: (30:47)I think as people start to learn more and more about bitcoin they understand that it’s less and less about technical features, but it’s more about some of the unique aspects of bitcoin’s design that are impossible to replicate. And at the end of the day, we’ve seen this time and time again if you have a company that has paid employees, you have a known founder, you have entities that are set up that hold funds that were raised, that creates points of failure that governments can go after.Meltem Demirors: (31:17)And bitcoin’s sort of birth and creation, and the myth of Satoshi Nakamoto, and how bitcoin was launched and released into the world I think has some of those characteristics of other social movements that sort of emerged that are leaderless that become really powerful. And by the way throughout history, a lot of revolutions have been started by pseudonymous or anonymous creators, writers who have hidden or obfuscated their names. And so, I think there’s this interesting sort of tension there where a lot of people try to reduce or simplify bitcoin to just technology, or to just money, or to just one thing.Meltem Demirors: (31:57)And it is complex and multidisciplinary and multifaceted, so in order to have that conversation, I think it just takes time for people to understand these multiple components that are working together to imbue bitcoin with some of the really unique characteristics that it has.Nolan Bauerle: (32:12)And I did notice your reference to The Matrix on Twitter recently where you did that great Twitter thread sort of linking what it really meant for the pills, and I think that speaks to what you’re mentioning right now, this sort of a choice of the foundation that you’re going to create some of these super and national institutions out of, or even just ideas that link us together. Maybe they’re not institutions at all, or maybe they’re just the type of tissue that goes between us all, so that we can transact, and have these types of relationships without the sort of pieces in the wall that were necessary to make it happen before.Nolan Bauerle: (32:50)So once again mentioning the reference to your Twitter thread and graph, or chart, or particular visual insight you have to offer the audience that can really sort of capture what you’re thinking right now with bitcoin in the world?Meltem Demirors: (33:07)Yeah, absolutely. I think just going back to that thread one of the points I was trying to make was the point around systemic risk, and SIFIs, or systemically important financial institutions, and what that means for systems. So I think one chart that’s really important, one graph that’s really important, I thought to keep in mind is the percent of the total bitcoin supply that’s held in third-party custody, and there is this ongoing sort of meme in the bitcoin community around not your keys, not your coin.Meltem Demirors: (33:40)But there is a fundamental question I have that if we institutionalize and financialize bitcoin, and we take 50% of the world’s bitcoin supply, lock it up somewhere with the GTCC, and we start trading paper certificates that represent an underlying bitcoin, and sort of dematerialize bitcoin markets, and detach them from the underlying, what does that really do for us other than to create a new tool for speculation? I’m not really sure.Meltem Demirors: (34:06)And so, one metric I’m tracking closely is the number of bitcoin in third-party custody according to our latest research, which is linked in the thread, and also on our CoinShares website. It’s close to 20%, and so that’s just an interesting thing to keep in mind. And then, the next thing I’m looking at … So that’s sort of relates to systemic risk we’re creating, and in my view if we’re just recreating the same financial system, if we’re recreating banks, and institutions, and governments because they’re the people who hold the coins ultimately, and control who can access them then that doesn’t really accomplish much of the end state of bitcoin, which I think is interesting, and sort of intellectually challenging to think about. It’s important to stay intellectually honest as we look at these things.Meltem Demirors: (34:55)And then, the second thing I think about that’s really more relevant on the macro scale is the balance of accounts and trade flows between countries. I think one of the big questions that’s emerging now US economic, political, military hegemony has been a reality for the last 100 years almost, and as we start to see geopolitics shift and get reshaped, and as we start seeing increasing anger, and social frustration in the world about wealth inequality, and income inequality, and the unequal consumption of our planet’s resources, and what the implications are I do think we are starting to see nation-states, and people kind of waking up, and saying, well, wait a minute. Why are we living in a dollar-defined world?Meltem Demirors: (35:49)And it’s interesting to see just over the weekend Rosneft, which is Russia’s largest energy exporter, said that they were going to start taking steps to minimize their use of the US dollar with the plan to eliminate it completely. And so, they could use euros, maybe they use digital renminbi, maybe they create their own digital currencies as means for payment and settlement, but that I think is really material because the petro dollar, the dollar defines 90% of the trade flows in the energy industry, and the energy industry’s a huge part of the global economy.Meltem Demirors: (36:24)And I think the other thing that’s really interesting here is the narrative around China’s adoption of blockchain technology, and the recent statements made by the government there that they fully intend to create a digitized currency that is going to be used by commercial banks to start, and what do commercial banks do? They finance trade flows.Meltem Demirors: (36:44)And so, I do think there’s an increasing awareness on the importance of the base currency that’s used to sort of shape economic activity around the world, and that’s an area I think is really fascinating, because again some of the aspects of bitcoin that make it unique, the fact that it’s leaderless, and not controlled by any one entity, and some of these things could potentially also position bitcoin well to be a neutral sort of means of a value transfer.Meltem Demirors: (37:14)And so, I think it’ll just be very interesting to see how different nation-states attempt to capture that narrative, an attempt to use certain aspects of what we’ve learned from the growth and rise of bitcoin, and other digital currencies to shape their own place in the world’s financial system.Nolan Bauerle: (37:32)Fascinating stuff, Meltem. We’re coming up at the end of our time here. So you’re going to be leading off Consensus: Invest. You’re our first keynote speaker out of the block’s that morning.Meltem Demirors: (37:44)Right.Nolan Bauerle: (37:44)So excited to have you there, excited to hear what you have in store, the research that you guys have been working on at CoinShares. I still use your Mining Profitability document that you guys created a year ago to really test, or to quantify mining profitability, through that whole big one, so keep up the good work. CoinShares’ research continues to be a reliable resource for myself. Thank you a ton for your time.Meltem Demirors: (38:08)Thank you.

While that may sound like a lot, it represents just 0.2 percent of XRP transactions. By comparison, $829 million of bitcoin, or 0.5 percent of that network’s transactions, have been spent on the dark web, the analytics vendor said.“Regardless of the amount, it just demonstrates that there is illicit activity going on in this coin,” said Tom Robinson, chief scientist and co-founder of Elliptic. “Therefore, if you are a business handling some of these transactions then you need to be checking for it because you don't want to be the organization that's being used to launder those proceeds.”Such concerns are especially acute for XRP’s target market, regulated financial institutions. Ripple, the distributed ledger technology (DLT) startup that owns an estimated 60 percent of the XRP supply and periodically sells the tokens to fund operations, has been pitching banks software that utilizes XRP for the last few years.A Ripple spokesperson said: “Like other cryptocurrencies, XRP is open source and decentralized – it’s available to anyone to use. Ripple enabled XRP transactions are secure and through regulated institutions.”  Blockchain forensic firms like Elliptic tackle crypto involvement in things like drugs, weapons, child sexual abuse material and ransomware-as-a-service. In the case of XRP, much of the transactions related to scams and Ponzi schemes, said Robinson. For instance, a large chunk was accounted for by the Plus Token “investment” scheme. Earlier this year, Chinese authorities arrested six Chinese nationals on the Pacific island of Vanuatu suspected of orchestrating the scam, which collected billions in crypto from people in China and South Korea.There has been an increase in the use of crypto to purchase things like stolen credit card numbers on the dark web and Elliptic had detected a number of those sites accepting XRP alongside other cryptos. But Robinson said the relatively small amount of illicit use of XRP might be down its association with traditional finance, compared to other cryptocurrencies. “The fact that the Ripple network itself has been targeted at large traditional banks maybe doesn't resonate with criminals trying to use it,” he said.Ripple set out to provide a cheap and efficient cryptocurrency bridge to connect correspondent banks and so provide near-instant cross-border payments. Back in 2015, it was among the first crypto companies to receive a fine from the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) for AML failings. But this was viewed as a positive among a fledgling crypto industry because it meant Ripple was closer to being regulated than other crypto firms at that time.The same could be said for XRP in the context of having its tires kicked by Elliptic, said Robinson, since highlighting illicit XRP activity will only improve the network’s credibility. “Wherever you have any kind of value transfer mechanism there is going to be potentially some illicit use,” said Robinson. “I think having clarity of that and being able to know where it’s happening should give banks comfort rather than a cause for concern.”To be clear, Elliptic was dealing with XRP, the crypto asset only. “We haven’t had any interaction with the Ripple company,” said Robinson. Another large investor in XRP is Japan’s SBI Holdings (previously known as Softbank Investment), which also led a $23 million investment round in Elliptic earlier this year. Tomoyuki Nii, executive officer for overseas investment at SBI Investment, said in an interview at the time that the bank was attracted to Elliptic because it was the best blockchain sleuthing firm when it comes to XRP.

Both inhabit real estate owned by Aluminum giant Alcoa which purchased the 33,000+ acre plot of land in the 1950s and turned the area locally known as Sandow Lakes Ranch into an industrial hub. Northern Bitcoin said two listed companies have signed on as its first clients and they “will use a significant portion of the capacity for Bitcoin mining,"" but the company declined to name them.In a joint statement announcing their merger, Aroosh Thillainathan, co-founder of Whinstone US, said the deal could “shape the future course of the global mining industry” and Mathis Schultz, CEO of Northern Bitcoin AG, said the merger “catapults” his firm launched in 2018 to the top of the pack faster than planned. In July, Whinstone’s previous proposed merger fell through after Hydro66 Holdings Corp., a Swedish data center builder, completed its own capital raise and backed out of the deal.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

It appears Wasabi Wallet processed at least 5,373 mixed CoinJoins in July, August and early September. If that trend continued for 12 months, it would put revenues at over $1 million. This newest addition rounds out Cypherpunk’s holdings, which include roughly 2,000 monero and 180 bitcoin, Frisby said, in addition to equity in the rival privacy project Samourai Wallet (valued at $6.6 million, based on Cypherpunk’s $100,000 investment for 1.5 percent equity) and the blockchain startup Chia, founded by cypherpunk legend Bram Cohen. “Both wallets, and privacy-enabling services, have very impressive network effects in that the more participants there are, the more private each participant is,” Cypherpunk’s CIO Moe Adham said. “Wasabi is well-positioned to capture much of that market … not only for personal use but also for enterprises.""Frisby said the fund was initially focused on providing exposure to privacy coins, but found scant traction among assets like zcash and quickly pivoted to projects that boost privacy for the bitcoin network. “We want to make two or three more privacy-tech investments, looking at things like VPNs, messaging systems, that type of thing,” he said, adding the firm is looking to deploy a large chunk of its $1.4 million in fiat holdings by mid-2020. In a press release, zkSNACKs CEO Bálint Harmat said these new shareholders as strategic partners helping “make Bitcoin fungible.” All things considered, this round proves an open-source product can go from a bootstrapped volunteer project that paid contributors with donated and earned bitcoin, all the way to VC-backed startup in roughly two years, pioneering a bitcoin-centric business model. “You just can’t underestimate the network effect of bitcoin,” Frisby said.Dominic Frisby image via Cypherpunk Holdings The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

According to a press release, Haney was accused of laundering close to $20 million using bitcoin in early 2018.Silk Road was among the dark web’s earliest drug marketplaces and a haven for its bitcoin-accepting vendors until its operator, Ross Ulbricht, was arrested in October 2013 and the site was shut down. Ulbricht is currently serving a life sentence on charges of narcotics distribution, computer hacking and conspiracy. Haney was one of the sellers who used the marketplace. According to the prosecutors, Haney was a “high-ranking member” of a narcotics outfit known as Pharmville, and is said to have received nearly 4,000 bitcoin from Silk Road-linked accounts through February 2012. According to the complaint, he trafficked in fentanyl, oxycontin and other narcotic sales.“Hugh Haney used Silk Road as a means to sell drugs to people all over the world,” U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman said in a statement. “Then he laundered more than $19 million in profits through cryptocurrency.”He was caught after liquidating his remaining bitcoins on an exchange for $19,147,053 in January and February 2018. The unnamed company froze his account and launched an internal investigation that ultimately led to a search warrant. Haney was arrested in July 2019.Initially, Haney claimed his bitcoin came from a mining operation. But investigators used “blockchain analysis software” to show the funds came from Silk Road, according to the July complaint.According to his plea deal, Haney pled guilty to one count of concealing money laundering and one count of engaging in a financial transaction in criminally derived property.

scalable payments. Last week Lightning Labs developer Joost Jager ...","Nov 9, 2019 at 09:50 UTC",Bitcoin’s lightning network might have a use case beyond faster and more scalable payments.,"Last week Lightning Labs developer Joost Jager revealed an experimental, new proof of concept: Whatsat, a version of lightning that can be used to send private messages.Like bitcoin, it’s censorship-resistant. But, unlike encrypted apps that morph messages into unreadable, garbled text to keep messages from prying eyes, there’s no central entity to stop users from employing the network.Jager told CoinDesk:“Lightning is a peer to peer network in which anyone can participate. There is no central entity that has the ultimate power to decide on [what] users are allowed to communicate.”Private messaging is a hot topic in the digital age, as it’s easy for bad actors to intercept messages that aren’t encrypted. Apps such as Signal and Wire give users more privacy, but private messaging is still far from everywhere.“I like to compare private messaging with talking to someone in person privately. We can do this without asking for permission,” Jager argued. “It is a freedom that is so natural, that we hardly even realize how important it is. As we humans continue to digitize ourselves further every day, I think it makes sense to extend this freedom into the digital domain.”Whatsat is a passion project for Jager, not something he’s working on for Lightning Labs. The app is at an early stage, not to be used with real bitcoin yet.Jager said it’s always been possible to add extra data to lightning payments. But a recent change to lightning’s specifications has standardized how this built-in messaging system works, so lightning network software remains compatible.There are other technologies that can be used to decentralize messaging, Jager said, but he argues there are some advantages built into lightning that other apps don’t have.“Lightning is not the only way to decentralize this, but it does have the advantage that it is also a payment network,” he said. “Running any sort of centralized or decentralized service costs money and with lightning it is easy to pay for that on a per-message basis.”It’s hard for chat platforms and social networks to achieve “network effects,” whereby they become exponentially more useful as more people use them. But twinning payments and messaging might help lightning.“It is a question of how many [peer-to-peer] networks you want to participate in. It simplifies things if you get the two major uses, payment and chatting, from a single network,” Jager said.Getting so many people to join such a project could be a challenge, Bitcoin Core contributor Sjors Provoost argued on Twitter. He suggested someone build “bridges” to popular existing apps, like WhatsApp or Signal, so users don’t have to download a whole new program to participate in the lightning chat.Messages sent on lightning are free for now. Whatsat “relies on the fact that there is no charge for a failed payment. The payment reaches the recipient, the recipient extracts the message and they fail the payment,” Jager said. But, should he or others develop the idea further, it’s unclear how lightning fees will evolve over time.“The network isn’t mature yet and realistic fees still need to be discovered. It is hard to give an estimate now on what the actual costs will be of running a routing node in the future,” Jager said.According to public data about the network, lightning payments currently cost a median of .0001 satoshis, a single satoshi (or 100 millionth of a bitcoin) currently being worth a fraction of a penny.“There surely are people willing to pay for it, but for what price would make it a no-brainer for almost anyone?” Jager asked. “Suppose the average user sends 30 messages per day. That comes down to about 1 satoshi per message with the current bitcoin exchange rate.”That’s about a dollar per year.“If the lightning network matures to a system that can sustainably handle 1 [satoshi] payments, I think a future of permissionless private messaging is unlocked,” Jager said.“The Dispatch of the Messenger” by François Boucher image via the Metropolitan Museum of Art"

average, 10x more volume than the underlying bitcoin spot market ...","Nov 16, 2019 at 10:00 UTC",Emmanuel Goh is co-founder & CEO of skew. – a financial technology startup headquartered in London since 2018. These opinions are his and do not necessarily reflect the view of CoinDesk.,"The following article originally appeared in Institutional Crypto by CoinDesk, a weekly newsletter focused on institutional investment in crypto assets. Sign up for free here.The race is on.One business day before the much-awaited ICE/Bakkt launch, the CME announced it would be listing bitcoin options in Q1 2020. ICE returned the favor by announcing it would also be launching options contracts but in December this year.Why are two of the largest exchanges in the world competing so openly for a space that was considered, until recently, as secondary by most industry insiders?Almost every week, a new player is announcing its intention to enter the increasingly crowded crypto futures market. Most recently crypto behemoths Binance and Bitfinex launched their own futures products, with varying degrees of success.This optimism wasn’t always there. The rise of Hong-Kong based BitMEX – home to the most liquid bitcoin contract globally – was for a long time met with skepticism by industry leaders, who dismissed the product as only serving gambling addicts with the use of high leverage.The crypto futures market really took off in 2018. Volumes increased by a factor of ten compared to 2017 levels – a year widely seen as the peak of the crypto market. Bitcoin futures and other perpetual swap instruments are now trading, on average, 10x more volume than the underlying bitcoin spot market according to data compiled by skew and Bitwise.(Source: skew.com)In hindsight, it is relatively simple to explain why. As the market entered a prolonged downturn starting in 2018, market participants looked for ways to profit from, or at least hedge against, the falling prices. The growth in futures markets came from that need to short the market.The market evolved rapidly from very little two years ago. In Q4 2017, the Financial Times published, in a well-researched article, how shorting the stock of chipmaker Nvidia – the products of which were very popular with cryptocurrency miners – could be one of the most convenient ways to get short exposure to cryptocurrencies.Traditional markets also experienced a “derivatives moment” in response to increased volatility in the market. The seventies were a period of incredible financial turbulence as Richard Nixon abolished the Bretton Woods system in 1971, moving to a fiat monetary system, and allowing all currencies to float. The world subsequently went through the first oil shock in October 1973, sending the price of black gold skyrocketing in what was previously a quiet market.A few months prior, in 1973, in a (not so) curious twist of events, Fischer Black and Myron Scholes found a simple analytical formula to price options, which won the 1997 Nobel Prize two decades later. The conjunction of those two events is widely seen as having started a glory period in derivatives products across all asset classes.It wasn’t just a fad. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in Washington estimates banks currently have exposure to more than $200 trillion notional of derivatives. Derivatives have gradually become the place where the majority of interested parties are coming to trade – across all markets.“We will tame Bitcoin” – Emeritus CME chairman Leo MelamedShould we believe the prediction from the legendary futures trader?There has been a consensus view that bitcoin is too volatile to be a medium of exchange – triggering a wave of “stable coin” projects in 2017 and 2018. The inelastic supply function of bitcoin is, by construction, indifferent to demand or supply shocks – making all the adjustment occurring through price and creating volatility as a result. Good logic, but not necessarily true in practice. For instance, this argument is also valid for gold, which is one of the lowest volatility assets around, with an average daily move of 0.6% in 2019 according to data obtained from the Federal Reserve of Saint Louis.There are a number of factors that contribute to an asset’s volatility. One of them is its market structure. Academics have extensively researched the impact of developing derivatives markets on the volatility of underlying assets and have overwhelmingly concluded that derivatives help to stabilize prices.This is particularly true for options, as flows are usually dominated by call overwriting (selling calls to overlay an underlying position) as investors are looking to generate extra yield. The income fund launched by LA-based Wave Financial is a first step in that direction within the crypto markets.Bitcoin’s volatility will decrease structurally as those markets keep growing.Derivatives rhyme with leverage, which essentially allows you to do more with less. That’s great, but only to a certain extent. As Warren Buffet famously said, derivatives are financial weapons of mass destruction and require careful risk management.Regulators have as a result been working on curbing the use of leverage globally. In May 2019, Japan’s FSA asked bitFlyer to reduce leverage for its perpetual swap product. The UK FCA is taking even more drastic action by planning to ban the offering of crypto derivatives to retail investors. The regulator also asks retail brokers to warn their customers of the risks of investing using derivatives products, across all asset classes.“CFDs are complex instruments and come with a high risk of losing money rapidly due to leverage. 72% of retail investor accounts lose money when trading CFDs with this provider.” – Welcome message on a popular retail brokerage platformIf 72% of investors lose money trading CFDs on low volatility underlyings, what could go wrong trading 100x levered products on the infamously volatile bitcoin?It is likely that, over time, regulators or simply Darwinism will increasingly put the derivatives market in the hands of professionals.Most participants – including us at skew. – spend probably too much time worrying about volumes. Derivatives volumes are mostly a function of leverage. When Japan’s FSA asked bitFlyer to reduce the maximum available leverage from 15x to 4x on the 28th of May, its volumes declined overnight by at least 50%.(Source: skew.com)Derivatives are zero-sum contracts between two counterparties. Traders and investors have to maintain collateral against those open positions. Leading venue BitMEX asks for a minimum maintenance margin of 0.5% and a minimum initial margin of 1%. The CME on the other hand asks for 37% of initial margin. That means if you would like to open a $1 million long position on BitMEX, you can post as little as $10,000 in collateral versus at least $370,000 at CME.The total $ amount of bitcoin futures contracts opened – called open interest – at CME currently stands at $150 million contract in comparison with $1.1 billion at BitMEX. Because of margin requirements it is likely there is a similar amount of money “working” to trade Bitcoin derivatives at CME and BitMEX despite the later trading 10x more volumes. The “herd” might be closer than people think.This is a great setup for the offshore exchanges which are able to make significantly more money from the same amount of capital as they collect their fees from the volumes traded.Victims of their own success, derivatives venues were hit in 2019 with a first-world problem.As trading occurs on margin, derivatives exchanges have been careful to design a spot price index derived from the price of what were, initially, much larger physical exchanges. The index is used to settle the contracts at expiry, and decide when to initiate margin calls. It was a smart way of preventing manipulation of the then not-so-liquid crypto derivatives contracts.However, as the derivatives market has grown exponentially, we have now entered a period where the underlying physical exchanges are much smaller than the derivatives exchanges – only 10% of total volumes in aggregate. It has become tempting to try to manipulate the less liquid underlying exchanges to yield some profits trading the derivatives.This was most visible earlier this year in May when a relatively small-size order on physical exchange Bitstamp triggered a wave of liquidations at BitMEX and took the entire market down.Exchanges seem to have been increasingly aware of the problem and have been attempting to strengthen their indices – sometimes with unfortunate consequences, as with a recent miscalculation at Deribit costing the exchange $1.3 million.“There’s a whole ocean of oil under our feet! No one can get at it except for me!” – There Will be Blood’s Daniel PlainviewWith the CBOE officially out, expect the competition between CME and ICE to be heating up in 2020 as the two exchanges roll out their options offering.It would be particularly encouraging to see corporate hedging flows taking off, led by mining companies and supported by physically delivered and options contracts. The Mexican government is said to have spent $1 billion on put options this year to hedge its 2020 oi production. Still some way to go for crypto derivatives.Men working the floor at the Chicago Board of Trade, 1949. Image by Stanley Kubrick via Wikimedia Commons."

This summer, law enforcement agencies led by Europol and Spain’s Civil Guard broke up a criminal organization using BTMs to launder profits and said it exposed a gap in European rules.Fort said that, generally, U.S. operators provide know-your-customer and anti-money laundering verification of users as required in law. However, ""we believe some have varying levels of adherence to those regulations,"" he said. As such, the IRS is focusing on the ""compliance issues"" with the operators. The official also explained that the IRS has not filed any public cases to date but it does have open cases involving cryptocurrency.The IRS may also start to look further afield in its investigations.

This September, Russian law ...","Nov 15, 2019 at 21:22 UTC","The formerly anonymous administrator of the cryptocurrency exchange WEX, which shut down last summer, has made some shocking claims about the fate of “hundreds of millions” of dollars of clients’ cryptocurrency in talks with Russian police.","Russian citizen Alexei Bilyuchenko, who confessed to being the tech administrator of the infamous BTC-e exchange and later co-founder of WEX, had been questioned as part of a criminal investigation underway in Russia since late 2018, BBC News Russian reported Friday. The report was based on materials of the probe, obtained by the BBC and reportedly confirmed as genuine by two sources “close to the investigation.”In his statements, Bilyuchenko said he was forced to send all the cryptocurrency in WEX’s wallets to unnamed staffers of the Federal Security Service (FSB), the successor of the Soviet KGB, shortly before the exchange ceased operations.The admin further said he had been close to Alexander Vinnik, the alleged operator of BTC-e, which has been linked to the massive Mt. Gox hack and was shuttered by the FBI in July 2017. When Vinnik was arrested in Greece to face deportation to the U.S., Bilyuchenko, who was with Vinnik at the time, immediately fled for Russia, he told investigators.Back in Russia, Bilyuchenko used the database of BTC-e users to launch the WEX platform, together with OTC trader Dmitri Vasilev, the official owner of WEX at that time.However, after business quickly slumped, Vasilev reportedly told a local media source that he’d negotiated the sale of the exchange to Dmitri Khavchenko, who’d been a militia fighter in the war in Eastern Ukraine. Khavchenko is also said to have links to Konstantin Malofeev, a Russian oligarch who is believed to be a sponsor of the pro-Russian separatist forces in the war in Ukraine, as per the BBC report.According to Bilyuchenko’s police statements, in the summer of 2018, right before WEX collapsed, he was in talks with Malofeev, who wanted to obtain the database of the WEX users, presumed to be for a new crypto exchange named Vladex, the BBC says. Malofeev has previously denied links to WEX to the BBC, and would not comment for the latest report saying it was “based on fabricated materials,” the broadcaster says.According to an audio tape from the investigation, also obtained by the BBC and reportedly verified by audiovisual forensics experts, Malofeev, who is known to be close to the Kremlin, wanted to open a government-friendly exchange and was pressing Bilyuchenko to hand the users data over to Vladex via a former FSB officer the report says is “probably” Anton Nemkin.Via a representative, Nemkin denied any links to Bilyuchenko or his business activities, the BBC said, though he is linked publicly to Vladex.Bilyuchenko also told police that two current FSB officers, named Igor and Grigori, made him give away the flash drives holding all the cryptocurrency of WEX users and transfer it to their wallets — assets worth about $450 million, he said. Bilyuchenko said he met the officers several times in 2018 in the FSB building and Lotte hotel in the center of Moscow.Neither the Russian police nor the FSB would comment on the matter when asked by the BBC.BTC-e, one of the first and largest crypto exchanges, had been operating since 2011 and closed by the FBI in 2017, as its alleged operator Alexander Vinnik was arrested in Greece following indictment by a U.S. court on multiple money laundering charges.Soon after Vinnik was arrested, WEX opened, promising to return users’ funds. The individuals running both BTC-e and WEX have always maintained anonymity, talking to the users under pseudonyms in the exchange’s trollboxes and on the Bitcointalk forum.After a year, WEX ceased operations and froze all withdrawals. CEO Dmitri Vasilev sold the entity to Dmitri Khavchenko (now his daughter is the nominal owner of the exchange) and left Russia.Millions of dollars worth of crypto left WEX’s wallets for other exchanges between July and October 2018, CoinDesk reported at the time. Users started filing police reports in October and several separate investigations have reportedly been launched in several cities in Russia and Kazakhstan. WEX’s former CEO Vaselev was arrested this summer in Italy on request of the Russian police but released soon after.BTC-e employees were also alleged to be involved in the hack of Mt. Gox, and are claimed to have funneled about 530,000 bitcoin to BTC-e’s wallets, according to the U.S. indictment. This September, Russian law firm ZP Legal offered Mt. Gox creditors a deal in which it would recover the stolen funds, citing the Russian roots of the theft.Last month, it became known that MT. Gox trustee Nobuyaki Kobayashi had contacted the U.S. Department of Justice requesting information on Alexander Vinnik’s alleged involvement in the Mt. Gox collapse.FSB building in Moscow image via Shutterstock"

The shares are already publicly traded on an over-the-counter market, but reporting company status would improve transparency and liquidity for shareholders. For example, the trust would have to make public filings of its quarterly and annual reports, as well as updates on unscheduled material events and corporate changes, just like Apple, ExxonMobil and AT&T do. As a reporting company, the trust could potentially attract investors who are currently restricted from participating in any investment vehicles that aren’t SEC-regulated reporting companies, Grayscale said. “The fact that it would be an SEC reporting company would perhaps give some of those institutions greater oversight or greater comfort,” said Grayscale managing director Michael Sonnenshein in a phone interview.Participants in the bitcoin trust could also more quickly liquidate their holdings if needed. Currently, investors must hold their shares for at least 12 months. If the registration statement is deemed effective, this could drop to six months, Sonnenshein said. Grayscale manages some $2.5 billion in assets across 10 different trusts, he said.The SEC usually takes 60 days to respond to filings like the one Grayscale submitted Tuesday, though “that is by no means guaranteed,” Sonnenshein said, since the U.S. securities regulator may request edits or ask questions. Should Grayscale successfully register the bitcoin trust, it would have to file 10-Q, 10-K and 8-K reports with the SEC, similarly to other publicly traded companies. Shareholders with more than 5 percent of the trust’s shares would be required to file beneficial owner reports. While the trust has no directors or officers, if it did, any with more than 10 percent of outstanding shares would have to report their transactions.Sonnenshein said he could not disclose how many investors or institutions this might include. Still, he said, the move should serve the growing demand for the bitcoin trust. The trust was the second-most actively traded security on the OTCQX market last month, he said, following Roche, a research-focused healthcare firm.“We’re seeing an ever-growing demand for exposure to bitcoin through a security or an access product like we offer,” Sonnenshein said.

futures contracts on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) since ...","Nov 22, 2019 at 11:40 UTC",,"Update (Nov. 26, 01:30 UTC): Schwab has officially announced a deal to buy TD Ameritrade for $26 billion in stock, confirming last week's press reports. An acquisition of TD Ameritrade by Charles Schwab would change the landscape of the traditional brokerage industry – and it may have implications for the ongoing mainstreaming of cryptocurrency trading.The companies are reportedly in talks, and while a deal is by no means confirmed, it would marry one of the few mainstream financial companies to embrace the crypto market with one whose stance is less clear. Nebraska-based TD Ameritrade has been allowing clients to trade bitcoin futures contracts on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) since 2018. Moreover, it owns a stake in ErisX, a bitcoin spot and futures exchange that may allow ethereum and litecoin futures trading as well. Speaking at CoinDesk’s Consensus in May 2019, the brokerage’s executive vice president Steven Quirk said there is high demand for digital assets among retail investors across different ages and registered investment advisors. “We get calls, emails, 60,000 clients have traded something in this complex,” Quirk said.Schwab, on the other hand, has not leaned in to crypto quite as much. The San Francisco-based firm did enable clients with futures accounts to trade Cboe Bitcoin Futures (XBT) on the StreetSmart Central or StreetSmart Mobile trading platforms as far back as April 2018, according to a statement from the firm. Cboe later phased out the product, however.Also, one of Schwab’s directors, Chris Dodds, also sits on the board of crypto exchange powerhouse Coinbase.However, as recently as September, Schwab pointedly said it had no plans to offer direct trading of cryptocurrencies, with a spokesman telling brokerage industry publication RIABiz: “Investors should view these currencies as a purely speculative instrument.” CEO Walt Bettinger – who would remain at the top of the potential merged company, according to news reports – is known for being cautious, which also suggests the firm would remain standoffish about crypto. “Schwab, similar to Vanguard, tends to be more conservative in their general approach,” said Kostya Etus, a portfolio manager at money management firm CLS Investments. “They are more methodical in launching new products and evaluating new initiatives, having a longer term view and outlook, because they don’t want to abandon something that doesn’t work,” he said. “Another way to put it is that they are very cost-conscious.” Neither TD Ameritrade nor Schwab has gone as far as Fidelity Investments, a close second to Schwab in traditional brokerage services, which earlier this year launched a crypto brokerage and custodian for institutional clients, Fidelity Digital Assets.“Fidelity can be more experimental with crypto services than Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade since it is privately held and more free of shareholders’ opinion over new investments than the other two public companies,” said Samuel Lee, a financial advisor at SVRN Asset Management. If Schwab were to take over TD Ameritrade, the combined company could hold more than $5 trillion in assets with 20 million clients, compared to Fidelity’s nearly $8 trillion  with some 30 million clients.Merging them could increase the scale of their businesses and further reduce transaction fees to boost their position as two of the most cost-effective brokerage services providers in the industry, said Jeff Tjornehoj, director of Fund Insights at Broadridge, a U.S.-based financial services company.“But it is still too early to tell how exactly the two firms would benefit from the deal,” Tjornehoj said. And the same goes for how it would affect their limited involvement in crypto, though part of the allure for Schwab may be TD Ameritrade’s tech savvy. “TD Ameritrade is a technologically advanced investment firm,” Lee said. The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

the introduction of bitcoin futures in late-2017 brought BTC ...","Nov 15, 2019 at 08:15 UTC",U.S. regulators are not yet sure about what to make of ethereum’s impending transition to a staking-based protocol.,"Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Chairman Heath Tarbert, who recently declared his view that the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is a commodity that could support a futures market, said this week his agency is still evaluating whether this will remain true after ethereum upgrades its network sometime in the coming year.Speaking at CoinDesk’s Invest: NYC conference on Tuesday, Tarbert said the CFTC and its sister agency, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), were both “thinking carefully” about the forthcoming Ethereum 2.0 upgrade which is designed to replace the coin’s current proof-of-work (PoW) model for transaction validation.In PoW, computer servers called nodes solve computationally-intensive mathematical equations in order to validate transactions and process new blocks. However, in Ethereum 2.0, these same nodes will stake wealth (in the form of ETH) and vote on new blocks rather than solve for them.“Staking is obviously different than mining in the sense that mining is by its very nature sort of more decentralized, whereas with the stake obviously it reduces energy costs because you’re just giving it to one validator or line of validators,” Tarbert said Tuesday.The CFTC, which has been looking into ethereum and its potential shift to proof-of-stake (PoS) since at least December 2018, is now looking into how decentralized the ethereum network will be after the 2.0 upgrade. In addition, Tarbert said regulators are also examining the requirements expected of users to run nodes on the Ethereum 2.0 network.“That’s exactly the kind of analysis that that we’re undertaking and the SEC is undertaking right now,” Tarbert said.This analysis will be key for any evaluation and eventual approval by U.S. regulators for a regulated ether futures market – which according to Tarbert’s earlier statements is “likely” in the next six to 12 months.According to Jehan Chu, managing director of Hong Kong-based crypto investment firm Kenetic Capital, a regulated ether futures market would be game changing in the U.S.“What regulated futures will do is allow institutional investors to trade this commodity,” Chu said. “They’re not going to be logging on to Bitmex and trading in size. They will potentially on Bakkt, the NASDAQ, etc. This is why you need to have regulated financial instruments and why CFTC’s commodity designation is so important.”Adding to this, Aaron Wright, founder of ethereum startup OpenLaw, said another core benefit of a regulated futures market would be better “price discovery” for ether.“Without futures, it’s more difficult for those that think the price of ether is overvalued to signal that to the market,” said Wright. (According to recent remarks by former CFTC Chairman Christopher Giancarlo, the introduction of bitcoin futures in late-2017 brought BTC prices back down to earth.)Some industry experts say both the demand and maturity of ethereum as a technology is still far too nascent for a futures market to be supported in the U.S. This is because ethereum futures contracts do trade on exchanges based outside of the U.S. – such as on U.K.-based Kraken Futures – but trade volumes for these contracts are relatively thin.Still, the most ardent supporters of ethereum are optimistic about the successful delivery of Ethereum 2.0. In fact, most believe the case for a regulated ether futures market is only strengthened in light of the upcoming transition to PoS.There are two reasons why.In June 2018, the SEC’s director of corporation finance, William Hinman, argued ether was not a security based on the understanding of the ethereum network as a “decentralized structure.”Danny Ryan, an Ethereum 2.0 researcher at the Ethereum Foundation, explained one of the key aims of ethereum’s PoS network is “better decentralization.”“With [PoW], there is some intrinsic centralization due to the hardware component tied to the real-world supply chain in which some people are more entrenched and can get more specialized hardware than average consumers,” said Ryan, adding:“In ethereum’s PoS, the capital that you need to acquire to participate is much more readily available. … Converting capital into an asset that allows you to stake in the protocol is much cleaner.”Eric Conner, founder of information site ETHHub and product researcher at blockchain startup Gnosis, said the minimum cost for an Ethereum 2.0 validator to process blocks and earn rewards like a miner would on ethereum today is 32 ETH or roughly $5,800.According to Connor, this is a comparatively lower barrier to entry than in PoW where “you would have to buy thousands of [machines] because the hash power on the network is so high.”“What’s interesting about proof-of-stake is that it takes away miner centralization,” Conner said.To this, Collin Myers, head of global product strategy at ConsenSys, the Brooklyn-based ethereum venture studio, estimates Ethereum 2.0 is targeting roughly 15,600 validators to secure the network at launch. Currently, there are only about 7,000 computer servers running ethereum software around the world.Currently, miners on ethereum are randomly selected to process new blocks on the network. By devoting higher amounts of computational energy to the network, miners have a greater chance of being selected to create a new block and earn rewards.In Ethereum 2.0, validators, who are the equivalent to miners in a PoW network, earn rewards on a more regular and predictable basis. Rather than using up computational energy, validators lock up 32 ETH as collateral to the network and earn rewards in the form of interest on their staked wealth.“Although the chance for reward is much more regular and frequent on PoS, the amount which you are rewarded as a validator is still related to your ability to participate well in the protocol,” said Ryan. “There is not an expectation of profit by doing nothing and through the work of others. It’s all related to your ability to provide services to the network.”Indeed, outside of staking, validating transactions and appending new blocks in the PoS network, validators are also expected to actively attest to the validity of a block in a shard or the primary PoS blockchain, called the beacon chain. This happens every six minutes in the new network, according to the Ethereum Foundation.“I don’t think it changes anything to be honest. Ether is a commodity as far as the … CFTC is concerned. I don’t see a reason why proof-of-stake would change that,” said Gnosis researcher Conner, adding:“It’s actually very similar to how proof-of-work works today when it comes to reward issuance.”Given that both efforts for regulated ether futures in the U.S. and Ethereum 2.0 are still largely theoretical, it’s difficult to draw a correlation between how one might impact the other, according to Chu of Kenetic Capital.“In my mind, the [ETH 2.0] roadmap isn’t impacting the markets yet. I don’t think it’s going to impact a [possible] futures market until … some major milestones come into place,” said Chu.What’s more, the actual criteria influencing how U.S. regulators make their decisions on what is or is not a security when it comes to cryptocurrencies is still highly uncertain, according to Felix Shipkevich, a New York attorney with a specialization in litigating on cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology.“We still don’t have clarity from the SEC on what type of tokens are securities and what are not,” Shipkevich said, adding:“Please explain to me, what does [the SEC] mean by decentralized? What is truly decentralized? … We do not have a legal definition of what decentralized versus centralized ledgers are and why bitcoin and ethereum in the eyes of the SEC [and CFTC] are not securities.”To put things in perspective, the only other cryptocurrency in the world that has been granted commodity status within the United States is bitcoin. As recently as September, the first physically-settled bitcoin futures contracts were launched and made available for trading on the regulated digital assets platform Bakkt.However, Shipkevich said bitcoin does not behave in a similar way to other traditional commodities. The majority of people buying bitcoin (and similarly ethereum) do so with the intention to speculate on the asset and earn high returns, Shipkevich said, adding:“These two cryptocurrencies are treated more like [equity] assets than truly cryptocurrencies. People buy bitcoin today because they want to hold and speculate on bitcoin.”Whatever the reason, Chu said he is confident U.S. regulators know more about these two cryptocurrencies than they are currently letting on.“I’m not concerned about the relationship between ether futures and ETH 2.0,” said Chu. “You don’t issue all of these enforcement actions without understanding what you’re enforcing.”Watch Heath Tarbert’s full remarks at Invest: NYC 2019Nikhilesh De contributed reporting.CFTC Chairman Heath Tarbert speaks at Invest: NYC 2019; image by Joe Jenkins for CoinDesk"

However, sources of the Economic Times estimated the firm was bought out for $5 million–10 million.The company's entry into India might at first glance seem surprising, with the local crypto industry having been greatly disrupted by a ban on banking services for crypto firms instigated by the nation's central bank in April 2018. Since then a number of local exchanges, including Koinex and Zebpay, have been forced to close, with the remainder moving to survive on crypto-to-crypto trading, and avoiding the fiat system.That's a strategy employed by WazirX , which launched earlier this year offering crypto-to-crypto and peer-to-peer trades, says the Economic Times. Binance, however, has a way round the banking issue, having launched Indian rupees on its Binance Fiat Gateway in recent weeks.

Synthetic, crypto-powered central bank money tokens, and the introduction of smart contracts that can represent and tokenize other real-world financial assets and contracts are on the rise around the world.These rapid changes are leading regulators everywhere to grapple with an economic system that is beginning to mirror the open, global and connected internet of information and communications.At the foundation of these shifts is the rapid development of public blockchain infrastructures, such as ethereum, which allow market participants to issue cryptocurrency tokens representing fiat currencies and other financial assets. This “base layer” of trusted computing, record-keeping and transaction processing can be compared to the base layer of TCP/IP and HTTP, protocols that allowed the vast global internet to come into everyday use.There are now several competing approaches to building a new financial system on this infrastructure.1. Open financeThe first is represented by crypto-native ecosystem players, including Circle and Coinbase, who are building fiat-backed stablecoins such as USD Coin (USDC) on top of public blockchains. These developments are enabling a broad base of developers and companies to build higher-level financial constructs such as decentralized lending and credit markets, payments services and tools for trade finance.Regulated by existing payments banking rules in the US and EU, these private market-based approaches are growing rapidly and help to form a pillar of the open finance movement.2. Government-runThe second approach is best represented by China’s forthcoming Digital Currency Electronic Payment (DCEP) infrastructure, which aims to build an entirely controlled, centralized and permissioned infrastructure for a digital currency version of the Chinese RMB.While likely appropriate for the Chinese economic and political model, this approach flies in the face of the open internet ethos and is not likely to receive much of an enthusiastic response from the broader internet development community.3. Private consortiaThe third approach, anchored in the proposed Libra Association and Libra Reserve Currency, attempts to build an “over the top” synthetic global digital currency.Like China’s effort, the Facebook proposal creates a centralized, permissioned infrastructure for this payment system, which will radically limit how open and accessible the infrastructure becomes for developers and companies wanting to build on top of it.In each of these approaches, we can extrapolate a fundamental worldview.With the first, do we want an open financial system built on the public internet that allows value to move freely and easily anywhere in the world with strong privacy protection, one that enables people and companies to build financial arrangements in code, enforced by public blockchain infrastructure and enabling commerce and transaction arrangements between people everywhere? In short, do we want a global financial system built in the image of the internet?Or, if the world embraces the Chinese approach, do we want a world with tightly controlled access to innovation in the financial system, with extremely tight controls on where capital moves and who can access the system? Such a system may enhance efficiency and global reach for the Chinese RMB. But will it mirror the tightly controlled internet that exists in China today? Will it be offered on equal terms to people and companies globally who seek to transact with China?The worldview put forward by Facebook and Libra suggests a new global financial system that is controlled and run by the largest private companies in the world. And rather than building on existing sovereign money, the Facebook construct seeks to create a new global currency that stands above the state. Do we want a new global financial system controlled by a few private companies, where permission to participate and innovate is mediated on a closed infrastructure?The largest governments in the world, especially those responsible for major global trade currencies, must now grapple with the innovation of public cryptocurrencies that have the reach of the global internet.The choices they face, and the decisions that are ultimately made by relevant policymakers, will have a dramatic impact on what our future global economic system looks like.Meanwhile, while governments study and debate these topics, bit by bit and block by block, technical innovators all around the world are using crypto to rebuild the global economic system in front of our eyes in a marvel of human ingenuity.“Risk” map image via Shutterstock"

The bill defines such assets as a “special type of valuable property in the digital form, created, accounted for and disposed of electronically,” such as cryptocurrencies, tokens and other kinds not specified in the draft.“We are confident that the adoption of this [draft] law will create conditions for the launch of the virtual assets market in line with the legislation of Ukraine, taking into account the balance of interests of entities engaged in transactions with virtual assets and the state, which will get additional tax revenue from such transactions,” said the ministry.If the bill passes parliament, the income from trading virtual assets will be calculated as the difference between the purchase price and the amount received at sale. Gains should be declared as “other” type of income, while losses may not be balanced out to reduce the total financial result before taxes, the document says.Crypto income would generally be taxed at the standard rate, which is 18 percent in Ukraine. But in better news for traders, there’s an initial 5 percent rate on personal income from the sale of crypto assets for a five-year period following approval of the bill (assuming it passes).Sales of crypto assets would not be liable for value added tax (VAT).Tokenized assets would see a different tax application, being defined as digital assets certifying ownership or non-property rights. In these cases, tokens would be taxed in the same way as the goods or services backing them.Michael Chobanian, founder of the Ukraine-based crypto exchange Kuna and president of the Blockchain Association of Ukraine, said he believes the law would work, but there are other hurdles facing the industry that need to be addressed.“If the National Bank of Ukraine doesn’t allow banks to open accounts for crypto businesses in Ukraine nothing for the industry will really change,” Chobanian said.The ministry recently announced a partnership with the Binance cryptocurrency exchange for assistance developing regulations for crypto in the country. It’s unclear, however, if the exchange was involved with the development of the taxation bill. Binance didn’t comment when asked."

The decision to move forward with that part of the plan is not yet been taken.Nikita Kulikov, member of the State Duma’s expert council and founder of PravoRobotov Autonomous Non-Profit Organization, told RBC that, rather than being a digital form of money, the BRICS digital currency would likely be used to facilitate trade transactions.“Most likely, it will be like certain obligations that can be transferred from one legal entity to another to confirm that the recipient will have claim rights, and the contractor will have obligations for a specific amount. It will not be money, we can say that it will be a paperless document flow to facilitate transactions,” he said.If that turns out to be the case, the project appears more like trade finance blockchain platforms such as Marco Polo, which has recently started working with Russian firms. Indeed the use case for blockchain, or distributed ledger technology, is seen as being bright in the world of trade finance, with a number of efforts underway, including We.Trade, TradeWindow and Voltron.Such platforms reduce the traditional reams of manually prepared and distributed paperwork, allowing a realtime view into the agreement and status of a trade for all participants to see. They can also have automated settlement, powered by smart contracts, built in to fulfill trade obligations when certain conditions (such as a delivery) are met.The new payments system, which would use members’ national currencies, appears in part to be aimed at reducing BRICS nations’ reliance on the U.S. dollar, and perhaps boosting the Russian ruble’s role in trade. Dmitriev said BRICS has already reduced its use of USD in settlements over the last five years from 92 to 50 percent, while ruble-based transactions climbed from 3 to 14 percent.Such blockchain-based threats to the role of the dollar internationally are soon potentially to rise in scope and severity, with the apparent imminent launch of China’s digital yuan and hints that the EU may develop its own e-euro. The Facebook-led Libra project has also raised U.S. regulators hackles, presenting as it does an alternative to USD for Facebook’s billions of global users.BRICS sculpture image via Shutterstock"

So far, those have all been over-the-counter (OTC) trading desks. “Between launching our trading platform five months ago to year-end, we will have more than doubled the number of liquidity providers,” Jessop told CoinDesk, declining to say exactly how many that would be. “We are primarily focused on OTC liquidity providers. It's likely we will connect to our first exchange perhaps before year-end.”The move would likely give FDAS access to a broader market and liquidity for smaller trades. OTC desks primarily trade with larger institutions and high-roller “whale” investors, whereas exchanges serve retail traders and smaller institutions. ""An exchange has more small order activity and is more comprehensive than an OTC desk which may rely more on relationship driven activity and is mostly used for larger block trades,"" said John Todaro, director of research at Tradeblock, a provider of institutional trading tools.FDAS, a unit of Fidelity Investments, is one of several firms attempting to bridge Wall Street with the wild world of crypto, along with Bakkt, the bitcoin futures market launched this year by Intercontinental Exchange.It's a bold challenge. For example, OTC desks have been easier to bring on board than exchanges, FDAS has found. “We apply a very high standard of counterparty evaluation, involving a rigorous risk management and onboarding process,” said a spokeswoman. “This approach is something we’ve been able to apply to OTC desks with post-trade settlement more readily than working with an exchange”Earlier this week, FDAS won a trust charter from New York’s Department of Financial Services. The charter allows FDAS to onboard New York clients and gives the firm more credibility with clients that are fiduciaries looking for a custodian with a trust license. While Jessop wouldn’t name the New York clients that FDAS is onboarding, Galaxy Digital recently announced that it was using FDAS and Bakkt to custody its two new bitcoin funds. Other New York clients will be onboarded in the next five to six weeks, Jessop said. FDAS has a diverse client base, including hedge funds, family offices, an investment advisor and a small, U.S.-based pension fund, Jessop said.  “The interest in that [pension fund] segment is there.”“We’ve been surprised over the course of the year about the level of interest and amount of work people have done to understand the asset class,” he said.After FDAS has onboarded New York clients, it plans in the new year to begin onboarding new assets, developing its trading capabilities, scaling its business and pursuing licenses in other states where it is not currently doing business. As a privately held company, Fidelity has been able to experiment with innovative technology without worrying about short-term payoffs. An R&D division, the Fidelity Center for Applied Technology (FCAT), has studied the crypto space closely, even mining bitcoin. FCAT recently completed a proof-of-concept with security token facilitator Tokensoft, according to a Medium post by Tokensoft Head of Operations Lawson BakerBits and Blocks Club, an FCAT internal learning group focused on digital assets and blockchain, launched a restricted ERC-1404 token on ethereum which “Fidelity employees used … in a closed-loop rewards system designed to encourage employees to attend internal events and other activities.”""From [European] banks to innovation labs at financial institutions like Fidelity's, TokenSoft is seeing traction up-market for institutional customers for security tokens and other financial assets,"" Baker wrote in an email. ""We think this trend will really show up in Q1 2020 when customers with potential registered offerings plan to come to the market.""The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

While the volatility of bitcoin, the most widely-owned cryptocurrency, is a favorite talking point of its detractors, stablecoins are digital currencies backed 1:1 with a fiat asset or basket of currencies, and designed to maintain a steady value.The report’s concern is that something could go wrong with the way the stablecoin works – be it, with operations, liquidity, or credit. “This loss of confidence could lead to a run,” it said.“In an extreme scenario, holders may be unable to [liquidate], with potentially severe consequences for domestic or international economic activity, asset prices, or financial stability.”Since the fraught launch of the Libra stablecoin concept in June, the Fed Governors, along with U.S. regulators and counterparts abroad, have been sounding alarm bells. Beyond the digital currency question, the integration with mass consumer social network could be disastrous, the report warns.“Stablecoin initiatives that are built on existing large and cross-border customer networks, such as Facebook’s Libra, have the potential to rapidly achieve widespread adoption,” the report said, echoing comments made by Fed Governor Lael Brainard last month. But now condensed into a single document, the report consolidates and formalize regulators’ concerns and notes the steps required to prevent a stablecoin catastrophe. The Fed’s report said:“As the Group of Seven has noted, ‘no global stablecoin project should begin operation until the legal, regulatory and oversight challenges and risks outlined [in this report] are adequately addressed, through appropriate designs and by adhering to regulation that is clear and proportionate to the risks.’”Federal Reserve image via Shutterstock"

The new options come in addition to the currently offered bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), bitcoin cash (BCH) and litecoin (LTC).Coinbase customers in Bulgaria, Croatia, Denmark, Hungary, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Poland, Romania and Sweden have now also been provided access to the card product.Zeeshan Feroz, CEO at Coinbase UK, said in a statement:“By more than doubling the number of assets our customers can spend on Coinbase Card, as well as introducing the card to 10 new countries, Coinbase continues to help drive crypto’s role as a utility, and not just an investment.”The Coinbase Card was launched back in April to serve the U.K. and EU nations. Coinbase says it “instantly” converts cryptocurrency to fiat currency when customers make a transaction using the debit card.According to the firm, the card can be used anywhere that accepts Visa, including internationally. There are fees for ATM transactions above the value of €200 – 1 percent domestically and 2 percent internationally – as well as charges for some purchase transactions, its website says.Coinbase also provides an iOS and Android app that lets users make Visa payments on their mobile devices. The Coinbase Card is issued by Paysafe Financial Services Limited, a firm authorized by U.K. regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.Product image courtesy of Coinbase"

But for firms touching cryptocurrency, the math is still fuzzy. The assumption of added regulatory hurdles and money-laundering fears have led to a widespread problem: Your average bank would rather just not deal with it.","Addressing those concerns with clear-eyed data is how compliance startup TRM Labs wants to accelerate the institutional embrace of crypto. And that’s why a group of investors are backing the blockchain analytics firm to the tune of $4.2 million in new funding.“Many might consider this the unsexy plumbing of the financial system but it’s what allows [crypto adoption] to thrive,” TRM Labs co-founder and CEO Esteban Castaño said in an interview. “We’re helping financial institutions to think through crypto’s potential as well as to mitigate any of the associated risks.”The slate of investors includes Reddit founder Alexis Ohanian’s Initialized Capital, SF stalwart Blockchain Capital and a new strategic partner, PayPal Ventures. The influx of capital brings TRM’s total funding to $5.9 million after the startup emerged out of Y Combinator earlier this year.It’s only the second blockchain-related investment disclosed by PayPal Ventures (the first was in April 2019) and comes just a month after PayPal itself withdrew from the Facebook-led Libra Association.While competing firms like Chainalysis and Elliptic are known for aiding law enforcement, TRM Labs is focused solely on finance.“Financial institutions use TRM to risk-score their cryptocurrency-related transactions, customers, or partnerships, helping them to simplify customer due diligence and meet regulatory requirements,” the company said in a statement.That means the startup scours over a dozen blockchains, analyzing billions of transactions for signs of fraud and money-laundering.The heightened interest from major players in traditional finance comes from a dawning realization that exposure to crypto is now “inevitable,” Castaño said.“This new world is coming,” he said. “We’re going to help the existing financial system adapt to this new world so they can effectively engage with it.”That doesn’t mean TRM is alone. Chainalysis, for one, already serves the finance sector, apparently to mixed reviews.“The existing providers are trying to tailor products to financial institutions, and we’re just finding they’re not doing a good job of that,” Blockchain Capital’s Spencer Bogart told CoinDesk.Regardless, he said, getting those institutions comfortable with crypto requires conforming to existing rules and regulations around tracking the provenance of customer funds.“Every time we’re talking to a financial institution, number one or two on their list of concerns is compliance and risk management,” Bogart said.TRM Labs is a team of 20, according to Castaño. The San Francisco-based company says it will use the new funding for product development, hiring and expanding to new geographies.Image: TRM Labs co-founders Esteban Castaño and Rahul Raina, courtesy of TRM LabsThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Oleg Nazaruk, director of the railway’s Department of Economic and Information Security had apparently reported the finding.“During the inspection of the premises where the so-called farm was located, more than 100 pieces of computer equipment were identified that were generating bitcoins. The aforementioned equipment was connected to the Ukrzaliznytsia power grid. The estimated amount of losses since the beginning of the year is UAH 1 million [$41,332],” Nazaruk said.Creating and and circulating cryptocurrency is prohibited in Ukraine under central bank rules, Ukrzaliznytsia said.The nation has been working on bringing in comprehensive cryptocurrency regulation for several years, a legislative effort that seems to be at last moving more rapidly. Most recently, crypto exchange Binance was said to be assisting Ukraine with developing rules for the industry.A criminal case has now been launched over the illicit Lviv mining effort and evidence from the branch has been sent to police, Ukrzaliznytsia said.The temptation to use company power or equipment to make easy money mining cryptocurrency is one that state employees seem to struggle to fight.Last year, several scientists working at a Russian nuclear weapons research facility were arrested for mining cryptocurrencies onsite.  Ukraine’s top law-enforcement and counterintelligence agency also found mining equipment at a nuclear power plant this August. Elsewhere, Florida state employees, Chinese teachers and Australian government contractors have all got into hot water over their secret mining efforts.Lviv station image via Shutterstock"

manipulating the bitcoin market in late 2017, sparking the bull market.","Nov 8, 2019 at 10:00 UTC","USDT tokens are now fully backed by Tether’s reserves, the stablecoin issuer said Thursday.","Tether published a response to what it described as “a flawed paper” written by John Griffin, a professor of finance at the University of Texas at Austin, and Amin Shams, an instructor the Ohio State University which claimed a single address on the Bitfinex exchange was responsible for manipulating the bitcoin market in late 2017, sparking the bull market. The paper was an update to a version first published in the summer of 2018.Tether pushed back on this claim, saying in Thursday’s statement that “the revised paper is a watered-down and embarrassing walk-back” of the first version.Perhaps more intriguing, however, was the claim that “All Tether tokens are fully backed by reserves.”Whether or not USDT is fully-backed has long been a point of contention. The company has promised an audit of its stablecoin reserves (though it has not delivered one, and has since dissolved its relationship with its auditor), produced a third-party report saying it likely had more funds than outstanding tokens, and had a bank write a letter vouching for its holdings. (The latter two reports both acted as snapshots, only assuring the crypto community that on specific days, Tether’s obligations did not exceed its assets.)Tether’s backing is even the subject of an inquiry by the New York State Attorney General’s office.Nevertheless, Tether maintained that its tokens were fully backed until April 2019, when general counsel Stuart Hoegner wrote in an affidavit that USDT was backed by “cash and cash equivalents … representing approximately 74 percent of the current outstanding tethers.”At the time, Tether held $2.1 billion in assets, with 2.8 billion USDT tokens issued on the Omni blockchain. According to a block explorer, this number has fallen since then to 1.775 billion. However, a further 2 billion USDT is in circulation as an ERC-20 token.Tether’s “Transparency” page says the company currently holds more than $4.6 billion in total assets, including $4.56 billion in U.S. dollars, $44 million in euros and $3.3 million in Chinese renminbi (amounts are converted).In an email to CoinDesk, Hoegner said the outstanding tokens are currently backed by reserves, adding:“According to the website and our terms of service, our reserves include traditional currency and cash equivalents and, from time to time, may include other assets and receivables from loans made by Tether to third parties. The 74% figure refers to particular assets at that point in time, not the aggregate reserves.”He declined to detail the breakdown between Tether’s actual cash holdings and the cash equivalents, saying “we generally do not share the asset mix.”As for the actual paper that Griffin and Shams hope to see published in the Journal of Finance, Tether’s statement Thursday said “the authors demonstrate a fundamental lack of understanding of the cryptocurrency marketplace and the demand that drives Tether token purchases.”The paper itself said its analysis “for the single largest player on Bitfinex” found that “the 1 percent, 5 percent and 10 percent of hours with the highest lagged flow of Tether by this one player are associated with 55 percent, 67.2 percent and 79.2 percent of bitcoin’s price increase over our March 1, 2017 to March 31, 2018 sample period.”The paper went on to say:“This pattern is not present for the flows to any other Tether exchanges, and simulations show that these patterns are highly unlikely to be due to chance; this one large player or entity either exhibited clairvoyant market timing or exerted an extremely large price impact on Bitcoin that is not observed in the aggregate flows from other smaller traders.”However, the paper suffers from having incomplete data, including insufficient data on capital flow or transaction timing, Tether said Thursday. As a result, the paper cannot “establish a valid sequence of events” for the claimed manipulation.“Furthermore, the authors now admit that the patterns of trading they observed could be consistent with the market purchase of Tethers, as opposed to the issuance of unbacked Tethers. Importantly, the authors do not possess or reference any data disputing that Tether has sufficient reserves to back up Tether token issuances in circulation,” the statement said.While the paper notes that “some in the blogosphere and press” have expressed doubts on whether Tether is fully backed, it adds that “the cryptocurrency exchanges largely reject such concerns.” However, it later says its model and results “are generally consistent with Tether being printed unbacked and pushed out onto the market.”The paper has received skepticism and pushback from the crypto industry, with Tether skeptic Bennett Tomlin calling it “inconclusive.”Tether logo image via Shutterstock"

The fissure revealed a common misconception in the blockchain industry.“One of Alibaba.com’s contractors hired a subcontractor who brokered an affiliate marketing program with Lolli. This was done without the knowledge of Alibaba.com,” an Alibaba spokesperson told CoinDesk. “Alibaba.com’s contractor is terminating the relationship with the subcontractor who was working with Lolli. As a result, Lolli should no longer promote or bring traffic to Alibaba.com.”He added that Lolli “never had the right to claim a partnership with Alibaba.com or imply one with Alibaba Group.”In response, Adelman said, “There has to be an integration for us to send sales to someone’s site.”However inflated the promotion of this Singles Day campaign may have been, Adelman’s team wasn’t completely off-base. Contractual agreements seen by CoinDesk appeared to permit the usage of “Alibaba related keywords” in online materials. The startup had already been processing bitcoin rewards for AliExpress shoppers since May 2019.According to Lolli’s head of communications, Aubrey Strobel, Alibaba.com itself trialed Lolli’s services for 24 hours during the Singles Day campaign, then deactivated “the partnership” after publicity drew attention to the trial.Subsequent coverage of the announcement misrepresented the deal as Alibaba accepting bitcoin directly. As CoinDesk reported on Friday, Chinese regulators appear to be gearing up for a renewed crackdown on cryptocurrency exchange-related services.“It seems as though there was a miscommunication on Alibaba’s end and while that’s unfortunate, we look forward to the possibility of working with Alibaba.com again in the future,” Strobel said in a statement. “In the interim, Alibaba Group’s AliExpress is still live on Lolli.”As it stands, the root cause of the mixed messaging is unclear.Blockchain companies often claim to have “partnerships” with brands when they really have an indirect affiliate contract or are merely working on a proof-of-concept. On the other hand, some paperwork with representatives from both parties had already been finalized and payments to shoppers were processed before the now-controversial announcement.This also underscores the challenge of defining what a “partnership” really means at the intersection of e-commerce and crypto.What the Lolli team saw as expanding on an existing client relationship during a mainstream holiday campaign by the flagship brand, Alibaba Group viewed as a private and “transactional” deal mediated by third parties, according to the Alibaba spokesperson. From Alibaba’s perspective, this was not an official partnership.The spokesperson claimed there was no direct contact between Lolli and the Alibaba Group, despite the AliExpress rewards processed. The spokesperson added that Alibaba Group does not work with any bitcoin-related companies.Alibaba building image via Shutterstock"

The new members are: custodians BitGo and Anchorage, trading firm and VC investor CMT Digital, lender BlockFi, and prime brokerage Tagomi.Released Tuesday, the draft is part of an ongoing effort by institutionally-focused companies to bring legitimacy to an industry regarded by traditional investors and regulators as a digital Wild West.“The digital asset industry has had a rocky first decade. Crypto investors have learned all the hard lessons of a century’s worth of financial crime and scandal in the course of ten years,” said Dan Burstein, the general counsel and chief compliance officer at the Paxos exchange, one of the group’s 10 founding members.“There hasn’t been a lot of transparency,” he added. “Investors don’t always know what’s a reliable place to conduct their trading.”To rectify that situation, the code sets standards for governance, ethics, transparency, fairness, compliance, risk management, information security and business continuity, as well as preventing conflicts of interest, market manipulation, money laundering and terrorism financing.For example, the draft says ADAM members should “be truthful in their statements, use clear and unambiguous language, make clear whether the prices they are providing are firm or indicative, and provide to clients and counterparties all material information” about business relationships.Next, ADAM will circulate the draft to its members for feedback. The group expects them to sign a final version of the code in early 2020.“As digital asset markets … become ever-more enmeshed in capital markets, it is important … to level the playing field and establish the high standards and operating protocols deserving of this promising and innovative asset class,” said Philippe Bekhazi, CEO of XBTO Group, another ADAM founding member, in a press release.Although it is not a regulatory document, companies that are found to have violated the code run the risk of being kicked out of the association and losing what ADAM hopes will become a powerful imprimatur in the market.“Being associated with ADAM is a signal to investors, business partners and regulators that you are making an effort in good faith to live by certain standards,” Burstein told CoinDesk.ADAM’s is not the first code of conduct for the nascent crypto industry – Global Digital Finance (GDF), a London-based trade group with more than 70 members, released one last year.That code totals more than 15,000 words, divided into eight separate PDF files. ADAM’s code is comparatively tidy: less than 4,000 words in a single, 12-page document.Because ADAM’s membership (all US) includes different types of companies with different business models, “we can’t be too prescriptive,” Burstein said. Instead, it took a “higher-level, principles-based approach,” setting general guidance rather than narrow rules.“The idea is not to tell people what they should be doing at all times,” he said. “We are, after all, in an innovation industry.”Philippe Bekhazi image via CoinDesk archives"

Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Nov 20, 2019 at 13:00 UTC","ShapeShift is launching its own token, FOX, doubling down on the exchange’s attempts to further decentralized cryptocurrency trading.","ShapeShift released the token, akin to Binance’s BNB, on Wednesday, enabling commission-free trading with zero fees between cryptocurrencies. All platform users who sign up get 100 FOX tokens automatically, which, if held, never expire and provide $10 worth of free trading volume per token on a rolling 30-day basis. “We've obviously been thinking about doing a token ever since 2017 and we wanted to wade into it very slowly and carefully,” said founder and CEO Erik Voorhees in an in-person interview Tuesday. “We've been kind of evolving our concept of what our coin is going to be over the last two and a half years.” ShapeShift’s FOX joins other exchange tokens such as Binance Coin and Bithumb Coin (BN). While still falling under the “utility token” classification, the ERC-20 token has a limited purpose, at least for now. “This has nothing to do with establishing a new chain,” Voorhees said of FOX. “Basically, we're trying to get people away from custodial exchanges. This is an endemic problem in the crypto world that was a problem in 2011 when I first got involved and it’s still a problem. So, we realized that to solve that we had to provide all that stuff in one place.”While similar tokens facilitate value transfers between exchange products, FOX furthers ShapeShift’s permissionless ideology by attracting users to a self-custodial exchange with more liquidity than similarly styled platforms, Voorhees said.For now, FOX is basically a digital coupon. In the future, Voorhees said, it could be used for more functions on the exchange. The exchange minted a finite 1 billion FOX tokens, he said.“We're hoping that this will help marginally move some people away from custodians and be more comfortable with the non-custodial model,” Voorhees said about the project’s aim.The token launch follows the July debut of ShapeShift’s new platform, which Voorhees said was an answer to the crypto market’s overreliance on custodial exchanges such as Coinbase.As such, Voorhees sees FOX as the third pillar of the company’s strategy to boost financial self-sovereignty“ShapeShift’s goal,” Voorhees wrote in a blog post published Wednesday, “is to make self-custody a seamless and enjoyable experience, because this will help the world move toward self-sovereign finance, and away from fiat.”Voorhees says the exchange has more liquidity than any other self-custody option, like decentralized exchanges (DEXs) or swap services. While total trade volume decreased on the platform since the implementation of KYC, liquidity has increased over the same period by 10x on the exchange’s main pair, BTC/ETH, Voorhees said.""ShapeShift is always the counterparty to each trade,” Voorhees explained. (Typically, order book exchanges match a buyer and seller for each trade.)“This means we provide liquidity in whatever increments we feel comfortable offering,” he said. “We enable up to $50,000 single trades, and a user can trade over and over so long as each trade is under that size.""The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The liquid part of the fund has done ...","Nov 8, 2019 at 14:00 UTC",Morgan Creek Digital now takes up around 1 percent of the assets of two Fairfax Retirement System pension funds – an investment which has more than doubled since taking their first position in the fund that closed in February.,"Two of the three pension funds under the system from Fairfax County, Virginia, the Police Officer’s Retirement System and Employees’ Retirement System,  invested $55 million in Morgan Creek’s second fund in October.The new allocation came after seeing good preliminary results from the first fund, in part because of the performance of crypto, which makes up 15 percent of the Morgan Creek’s investments; the majority of the fund’s positions are in blockchain-related infrastructure companies.“The final close for fund one was only in February of this year, and it is a short time frame admittedly,” Katherine Molnar, chief investment officer of the police officer’s fund, told CoinDesk.“It’s gone well and part of that is because of Morgan Creek’s decision for how they’ve timed buying bitcoin. The liquid part of the fund has done quite well based on how they have timed ramping that up in the portfolio.”The police officer’s pension fund contributed $22 million of the investment while the county employees’ fund put up $33 million. Molnar said $50 million of the investment went to the second fund raise while $5 million was a separate co-investment in a specific undisclosed project under Morgan Creek.Those figures represent around 1.5 percent of the police officer’s fund’s 2018 total assets and around 0.8 percent of the county employee’s fund‘s total assets from the same year. For context, both pensions normally put up around 2 percent of their assets in a new investment.This time around, convincing the board to re-up the investment was easier than taking the initial stake.Molnar said:“We didn’t have to do a lot of extra explanation or discussion, and people are generally pleased with the way the performance is off to a good start. It was a much easier legal process because the lawyers did a good job on the first contract.”The Morgan Creek fund was characterized as a private equity venture capital fund, and a replacement for a small capitalization US equities fund in their portfolio – one of the higher return and higher risk parts of pension fund investing.While the crypto part of the Morgan Creek Digital fund is performing well, the pension fund’s CIOs expressed the most interest in the blockchain side of Morgan Creek, which makes up 85 percent of the fund.Andy Spellar, chief investment officer of the employee’s fund, told CoinDesk:“Think about every time you go to buy a property and refinance – you have to pay title insurance for someone to figure out if there’s a lien against your property. If the ownership of your property is digitized and transferred instantly, in the way that this is done in a day, title insurance goes away.”As pension funds suffer from low interest rates, technology venture capital funds become more attractive to funds trying to meet their return targets, Spellar added.“It’s a problem across the board for everybody,” Spellar said. “The level of interest rates is a major component of your total return over time.”Since all assets are priced off of cash, low cash rate affects the price of every other asset class, Molnar added. This hasn’t yet convinced the two funds to invest in purely crypto-focused funds, however.“We’re not doing this for crypto exposure, but we do get some of that, and it does so far exhibit some uncorrelated behavior relative to other asset classes,” Spellar said. “To be honest it’s so early in its lifecycle that I don’t have a good idea of whether that will hold up or not.”Spellar, in general, sees any kind of disruptive technology as a hedge against traditional investment.“We’re looking for disruptive innovation – anything that can be negatively correlated to other things we own,” Spellar said. “So if we own a bunch of banks, this is a way to hedge against their monolithic and slow moving processes.”Image via Fairfax County Virginia Police Department Facebook page"

It’s based on an allegation made by the New York Attorney General’s office in April that USDT was not backed 1:1 by U.S. dollars and a study published by professors at the University of Texas at Austin alleging that a single account used USDT to drive up half the price of bitcoin’s 2017 surge.The letter, sent to the U.S. District Court in the Southern District of New York, claims that the plaintiffs’ lawsuit ignores a subsequent version of that academic paper where the authors withdrew one of its central allegations – that trading patterns reveal the issuance of unbacked Tethers.Last week, in a statement, Tether described the revised paper as “a watered-down and embarrassing walk-back” of the first version. As for its reserves, the company also points to the Transparency section of their website that shows $4.5 billion in assets, with a $100 million cushion above its liabilities.In the letter, Tether also claims that the plaintiffs could not prove Tether and Bitfinex, the exchange that issues Tethers, were responsible for the transactions that occurred or that the traders actually suffered injury from the market crash.The letter also refuted claims that Tether had monopoly power over the stablecoin market, had participated in racketeering, and committed common law fraud among other allegations.The original lawsuit, filed by David Leibowitz, Benjamin Leibowitz, Jason Leibowitz, Aaron Leibowitz and Pinchas Goldshtein, was filed by Vel Freedman and Kyle Roche – the lawyers who won a federal case against Craig Wright. Bitfinex, Tether, Digfinex and current executives; former chief strategy officer Philip Potter; and payment processor Crypto Capital are named as defendants in the case.Tether image via Shutterstock "

The product’s underlying asset will be held by Coinbase Custody, Amun said.As a PoS chain product, Amun’s newest ETP will also issue staking rewards – termed “baking” in the Tezos system – by Coinbase, which will be automatically reinvested into the holder’s ETP shares. In other words, the longer you hold the product, the larger your underlying share becomes.“Some staking services initially began as being secluded to a specific blockchain,” Amun CEO Hany Rashwan said in the statement. “Via our ETP, [investors can] participate in the associated rewards for contributing to the security and stability of the Tezos blockchain – without the need to ever have to set up a crypto wallet or taking care of a private key.”Amun and others choosing of tezos speaks to the underlying asset’s stability, according to data provider Messari research analyst Wilson Withiam.“Tezos is quietly becoming a viable option for the issuance of tokenized securities. There’s a growing confidence among security token issuers that tezos can provide the tools and security necessary to facilitate similar efforts,” Withiam said.Tezos’ edge comes down to its consensus mechanism, Withiam said. While other cryptos are transitioning to PoS, Tezos’ protocol is up and running. For example, Alliance Investments recently employed Tezos for tokenizing real estate contracts amounting to nearly $650 million this October.Ethereum is slated to transition to PoS in its next iteration, Ethereum 2.0, in Q1 2020, as is blockchain platform Cardano. How capital will flow onto the newly transitioned PoS platforms is a story yet to be told, however.“Tezos’ on-chain governance also gives it an interesting dynamic. Security token issuers can participate first hand in the future direction of the protocol,” said Withiam.Amun CEO Hany Rashwan image via Amun"

bitcoin and other assets. One factor that makes Bitspark unique among ...","Nov 18, 2019 at 08:50 UTC",This is the latest in a series of ICO Followups examining the aftermath of the 2017 token boom.,"Out of dozens of token projects that supposedly aimed to offer financial services like remittances to the unbanked, Bitspark is one of the few still fully operational today.If Facebook’s Libra project truly aims to serve the globe’s 1.7 billion unbanked, the Hong Kong-based Bitspark might offer some insights.Bitspark was founded in 2014 and raised $1.3 million worth of cryptocurrency in a 2017 initial coin offering (ICO), according to co-founder Maxine Ryan. To date, the remaining crypto has appreciated to $2.8 million worth of bitcoin and other assets.One factor that makes Bitspark unique among surviving token projects is that it was originally a bitcoin-centric project that switched to the open-source BitShares blockchain for quick scaling (Most of Bitspark’s $2.8 million in reserves is in BitShares’ BTS token, for instance). Unlike ethereum, BitShares co-founder Dan Larimer is no longer actively focused on this blockchain and it is primarily maintained by volunteers.As such, BitShares had some of the benefits of being a public ecosystem, like bitcoin, yet also wasn’t too big to work on scaling solutions with Bitspark when the startup migrated to that technology on the back-end.So far, Ryan said most of Bitspark’s expenditure has been on staff (a team of 20) and operations, not marketing or community grants like many other token projects. Bitspark currently operates in Hong Kong, the Philippines, Indonesia and Vietnam. Ryan said the startup plans to expand in 2020 beyond its two current cash-for-crypto centers in Hong Kong and 35 in the Philippines, thanks to a deal with the fast-food chain Calimex (Bitspark refers to these locations as “cash points”).“While it's still in the early stages of the launch phase, we have seen a meaningful uptick of 3–5 percent in transactions,” Calimex owner Jordan Moss told CoinDesk. “Becoming a Bitspark cash point has opened up the opportunity for a new revenue stream as well as facilitating cross-selling with Bitspark’s members and the crypto community in general. While coming in to use the cash point, we encourage customers to stay and enjoy a burrito or a margarita.”Moss, who says he doesn’t own any crypto and wasn’t involved with the industry prior, added an important point about Bitspark’s focus on cash.“Bitspark makes the complex easy for non-crypto businesses and people who are seeking to get into the space,” he said.Indeed, Bitspark uses the token for a traditional points-based rewards program, which allows the user to cash out those ZEPH tokens for bitcoin or use them for transaction fees. There are some unbanked users able to use Bitspark services, but they are not the profit driver this startup relies on. “Our services are available not only to the unbanked but as an alternative to existing financial services generally,” Ryan said. Co-founder George Harrap told CoinDesk that, like several other startups who still have several years of runway since the 2017 bull market, Bitspark is able to make a small profit because it doesn’t base its revenue model on the ZEPH token. Furthermore, he said Bitspark processes transactions and currency swaps on the backend, using the BitShares decentralized exchange (DEX).“In any of our conversations with customers, it's there in the background doing its thing,” he said of ZEPH. “It’s an added incentive for customers to use our products, but the value to them should be in the product first and foremost, not the token.”One such user, Japanese professor Fujita Kazuhisa, tried Bitspark during a trip to Hong Kong. He told CoinDesk he bought a tiny amount of bitcoin back in 2015, and has a high level of technical knowledge, but doesn’t consider himself a “crypto” person. He is, as Crypto Twitter might say, a relatively normal person who is not routinely active in “the space.”“I think Bitspark is unique in the sense they are using a DEX and a stablecoin backed by BitShares’ collateral system as the gateway to offer their crypto remittance service,” Kazuhisa said. “Their service is well designed to make it easier to use [than a DEX]. But ... emerging fintech remittance companies, who rely on fund settlement in the traditional finance networks … may still be more efficient and easier to use.”In short, he’s curious about the company and might use it again in the future, although he doesn’t rely on it for routine needs.This BitShares user experience highlights some of the common themes across token projects that have yet to fail.They serve small groups of tech-savvy users, utilize a hybrid business model that is primarily traditional even though it includes proverbial “token economics.” (In Bitspark’s case, the exchange aspects are primarily on the back-end.) Bitspark also raised a small and undisclosed amount from the traditional venture firm Reinsurance Group of America via an incubator program. For Facebook, which has opted to try to foster its own blockchain ecosystem rather than use bitcoin or another established technology, this could create governance and upkeep challenges that Bitspark didn’t have to overcome. To the contrary, Bitspark switched to the BitShares blockchain and found a rare crypto community with both a power vacuum and a working exchange with relatively reliable liquidity. Unlike zcash or ethereum, for example, other startups weren’t already occupying the brand awareness associated with the BitShares blockchain. Bitspark found a balance between open-source collaboration, with BitShares volunteers, and the independent ability to tweak, deploy and execute features for the startup’s proprietary services. Facebook will need to blaze its own path toward the same goal if it aims to truly foster an open ecosystem.Doing this at scale – well beyond the mere hundreds of participants involved with Bitspark’s ecosystem – would be ambitious at best. Plus, as if that wasn’t complicated enough, any lack of cash on-ramps would be an issue for any unbanked users. “The bottlenecks aren’t blockchain scalability, the real bottleneck is between the real world and the virtual world,” said a Bitspark user who works in the crypto sector. “I’ve both bought bitcoin and sold bitcoin at the cash points [in Hong Kong]. … The whole process took me about seven minutes, which is a little longer than it should take.”This user, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that Bitspark is ""still at an early stage"" of user adoption. ""The most resilient of all the bridges will be cash, paper bridges.”The Bitspark user has a bank account, but added that anyone can arrive in Hong Kong and use the service to transact locally regardless. This applies to corporate users as well as the individuals that companies serve. For example, the power company Okra Solar has used Bitspark to settle cash transactions on the blockchain in the rural Philippines, Ryan said, by using the Bitspark mobile app.“The unbanked experience a starkly different reality to what Facebook's Libra portrays it as,” Ryan said. “This is apparent by their members – where there isn't a single consideration for cash settlement. … If [Libra] did [understand], they would have members like Western Union who do service the unbanked with cash settlement as the focus.”Maxine Ryan and George Harrap image via BitsparkThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

That would lead traders to increase dollar deposits with Silvergate.“We don't predict when it will happen but we know that there might be an additional period where the volatility drives up volumes, and want to make sure that we can help our customers when that happens,” he said. One potential catalyst could be the bitcoin block reward getting cut in half in the next year, Lane said, with the idea that a decrease of new supply could boost the price. Other events might include regulatory approval of exchange-traded funds for crypto, hard forks that create new breakaway currencies such as bitcoin cash, or high-profile hacks of crypto exchanges that affect sentiment. “In our experience, it's not so much about the absolute price of the asset, but rather the volatility in the price where we actually see potential changes in the behavior of some of our customers,” Lane said. The California-based commercial bank plans to launch a cryptocurrency lending product in the fourth quarter and settlement and custody services for fiat currencies and digital assets by June 2020 at the latest. Two of its biggest profit generators are transaction fees from trading and yields on the investments it makes using client deposits, Lane said, with the fresh capital offsetting its investment in new products for those areas.The new lending product, set to be launched in fourth quarter 2019, would be part of the Silvergate Exchange Network (SEN) – a payment system designed for crypto exchanges and their big clients to transfer funds in the network. It would enable clients to borrow fiat currencies from the bank using bitcoin holdings as collateral, according to Lane.The bank decided to add the settlement and custody services within six months after launching the lending product because of the growing demand from its client base, he said. “We've already been working with the New York DFS, and submitted an application with them to form a New York licensed trust company for our settlement and custody services,” Lane said. Other New York-chartered trust companies in the crypto market include Coinbase, Gemini, Paxos, Bakkt and Fidelity Digital Asset Services.Overall, Silvergate is among a very short list of U.S. financial institutions that are banking crypto institutions. They include Metropolitan Commercial Bank, Signature Bank, and Cross River Bank. Silvergate’s clientele is approximately 60 percent U.S. and 40 percent international entities, Lane said.Silvergate Bank was formed as a traditional commercial bank in Southern California in 1988, but started pivoting in 2013 to serve crypto exchanges, startups and institutional investors. Lane said that the decision to enter the crypto market was simple: “Our loans were growing faster than our deposits, we were just looking for other sources of deposits.” He said that today its balance sheet is still deep enough to support much more loan volume from crypto customers. The bank doubled deposits in 2017 and more than tripled the client base since it started banking crypto-related businesses, according to its IPO filing.  Prior to the IPO, Silvergate had raised $114 million through a private placement in February 2018. Nine months later, Silvergate agreed to sell its San Marcos, CA, retail branch and its business lending team to Seattle-based commercial bank HomeStreet. That sale, completed in March 2019, included the reduction of $115.4 million in loans and $74.5 million in deposits, but resulted in a pre-tax gain of $5.5 million, according to the IPO filing. Lane said the deal was part of the bank’s effort to shift more toward its crypto businesses, as well as pay for investments to bolster that side. “We’re essentially bringing the legacy banking system that only operates 40 hours a week during business hours into the 24/7 crypto markets that never sleep,” he said. Silvergate Bank listed its shares on the New York Stock Exchange under the trading symbol SI, via a $40 million initial public offering on Nov. 7. The bank completed its IPO on Nov. 12, raising approximately $10 million from issuing 824,605 common shares, while existing shareholders reaped $30 million from selling 2.5 million of their shares. The shareholders, which include Bankcap Partners, a Dallas, TX,-based private equity firm and Park West Asset Management, may exercise a greenshoe option to sell up to 499,999 additional shares in November, according to the IPO filing. Silvergate Bank’s shares debuted at $12 on the NYSE and were trading at $16.35 on Wednesday, valuing the company at $319 million.“We know that the last time there was a big bull market in crypto, our deposits surged and that's part of the reason to go public, in case we have another big growth spurt and we need capital,” Lane said. “Now that we're public, we have more efficient access to capital to support our growth.""

That compares to most leading exchanges average with about 6 bitcoins traded to one on-chain. “There should be a relationship with the bitcoin moving onto the exchange and how much it is traded,” Philip Gradwell, chief economist for Chainalysis and compiler of the report, said. The findings of the report were announced at the Chainalysis Links conference in New York. BitForex did not respond to requests for comment on Friday.The Chainalysis report comes as crypto entities apply more pressure to exchanges suspected of fake trading volume, with new tools to track suspicious activity and more metrics to rout out likely fakers. The problem is widespread. According to a Bitwise Asset Management report presented to the Securities and Exchange Commission in March, nearly 95% of bitcoin trading volume is faked.BitForex could represent a small slice of that fake volume. Its reported ratio is far higher than the top 10 exchanges by volume in the Bitwise 10, a metric of leading exchanges. While those average a ratio of 6:1, BitForex’s is the outlier at 40,000:1. In an interview, Chainalysis’s Gradwell said exchanges gain popularity and users by ranking high in trading volume. Comparing the practice to SEO, or search engine optimization, the digital strategies websites deploy to increase their Google standing, Gradwell said the higher exchanges rank, the more visible they are to customers, the more customers will come.This incentivizes reporting high trading volumes, even if the exchange manipulates their data to misrepresent reality. Gradwell said that comes at the customers’ cost.“It’s really going to degrade the trading experience,” he said. “If you’re a new entrant to crypto, and you think you’re going to a popular exchange – that actually has faked volume – it’s not going to be a very liquid exchange. You’re not going to get the best prices, or be able to buy or sell quickly.”Investigators, researchers and market manipulators turn to BitForex for its comparably lax standards (the exchange is known to practice transaction mining) and past research also suggests BitForex may not be truthful in its reported figures. A July exchange volume report by Alameda Research scored 48 crypto exchanges on a variety of criteria; BitForex failed five of the six tests.“It creates a broader harm for the industry,” Gradwell said – institutions cannot trust a marketplace whose participants routinely cook their books.But the Chainalysis report also showed that industry participants react to negative exposure. Chainalysis examined 12 exchanges that were likely faking trading volume in 2018 – including Bithumb and Huobi. After a suspicious spike in late 2018, and the subsequent media coverage, the exchanges began reporting volume with ratios more consistent with the market leaders. BitForex charts via Chainalysis"

The statement also defines smart contracts as ""enforceable agreements"" under English law. The government-backed LTDP is an industry-led effort set up to assist the transformation of the U.K. legal sector through technology. The UK Jurisdiction Taskforce – one of six panels under its umbrella – is chaired by  Sir Geoffrey Vos, chancellor of the U.K.'s high court, and also includes members such as Christopher Woolard, board member of the Financial Conduct Authority, and Sir Antony Zacaroli, justice of the high court.Calling the statement a ""watershed,"" Sir Vos said it addresses a number of ""difficult legal topics in a very approachable and intelligible manner."" The task force undertook the effort to ""provide much needed market confidence and a degree of legal certainty as regards English common law in an area that is critical to the successful development and use of cryptoassets and smart contracts in the global financial services industry and beyond,"" he said.The statement is expected to provide a solid foundation for the mainstream adoption of crypto assets and smart contracts in the U.K. and potentially give a boost to companies working in the crypto industry.The task force further explained the potential importance of smart contracts in the press release, saying: Smart contracts can be used to create more secure and more efficient ways of implementing (and automating performance of) contracts between parties. This could revolutionise agreements, from mortgages and medical research to property ownership, as smart contracts automatically execute transactions and remove the need for a middle man.The statement was finalized after consultation with ""the tech community"" and the financial services sector, as well as regulators and legal experts, Sir Vos said.Going forward, the Law Commission will consider whether any legislation may be ""desirable"" in the area of crypto assets, the high court chancellor said.

Also covered is the entirety of the on-boarding process for clients which involves the generation of private keys within the company’s HSMs, as well as collusion within Ledger leading to insider employee theft.The policy does not, however, cover theft via a third-party remote hack of the type reported fairly regularly at crypto exchanges around the world. The Ledger Vault solution itself is meant to prevent this type of hack by isolating private keys from the internet.Firms using Ledger Vault set up their own transaction controls and governance procedures. The firm is trying to move away from the frame of reference of online “hot” wallets and offline “cold” ones, calling itself “temperature-agnostic.”On top of the new insurance policy, Ledger Vault clients will be well-placed to arrange their own dedicated primary insurance facilitated and “fast-tracked” by Marsh and Arch, the companies said.  “Clients that are part of this insurance program for Ledger Vault have the ability to obtain a dedicated limit that is dependent on the assets held on the Ledger Vault platform,” said Jennifer Hustwitt, senior vice president at Marsh & McLennan Companies, the insurance broker’s parent. “It would be separate from the $150 [million] that Ledger is purchasing.”James Croome, vice president of specie at Arch, said in a statement that the syndicate “spent over six months working with the Ledger Vault team to develop a customized offering for their clients.”Ledger has sold 1.5 million units of its flagship consumer product, the Nano, a device for storing private keys to crypto wallets.Ledger image via CoinDesk archives"

Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Nov 15, 2019 at 21:56 UTC",The hammer is coming down again on the Karatbars ecosystem as German and South African regulators have taken separate actions over sales of a purportedly gold-backed cryptocurrency.,"Germany’s Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) disclosed Monday that it had issued a cease-and-desist order against Karatbit Foundation on Oct. 21 for issuing its KaratGold Coin without necessary licensing in the country. Also Monday, South Africa’s Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA) warned consumers to avoid investments offered by Karatbars International GmbH, a German firm that promotes the allegedly gold-backed KaratGold Coin.Under the BaFin order, the foundation must “wind up [its] electronic money business” in Germany, the regulator said. BaFin did not respond to requests for comment by press time.Run on the ethereum blockchain, the KaratGold Coin (KBC) is listed on about 30 exchanges such as Yobit, with a second token, KaratBank Coin (KCB), yet to launch.The Belize-based Karatbit Foundation is the issuer of the KaratBank Coin and manager of the Karatbank ecosystem, according to the KaratBank Coin white paper, which describes the entity as “unregulated.”Karatbars International did not respond to questions by press time.Meanwhile, Karatbars International has denied accusations leveled in German business publication Handlesblatt, according to a company Facebook posting Tuesday and a story published Wednesday by The Guardian.Handlesblatt reported Monday that the Karatbit Foundation is under orders to return investor funds amounting to $100 million, equivalent to the amount raised in a 2018 initial coin offering (ICO). Harald Seiz, CEO of Karatbars, further said in the Facebook post that the German finance regulator is mistaken in its order against the firm, basing its actions on a scam website not associated with his firm. He further claimed that the Karatbit Foundation lies outside the regulator’s jurisdiction as German investors were barred from partaking in the ICO.“We are completely transparent, we have nothing to hide, if there are unanswered questions, we will clarify them, of course, we fully cooperate with the relevant authorities and are very anxious to clear up any misunderstandings as fast as possible interested,” Seiz said in the post.Seiz also said KaratGold Coin (KBC) is a utility token and therefore “not subject to prospectus” requirements under BaFin regulations and certain interpretations of European Banking Authority guidance.“Karatbars and its products have never damaged a customer or partner,” he said.The FSCA said Karatbar International has solicited South African investors via messaging platform WhatsApp to purchase unspecified investments without holding the necessary authority to operate in the country.The warnings from South Africa and Germany come a month after CoinDesk reported on a Florida financial regulator’s inquiries into Karatbars International. As stated in that earlier report, although Karatbars has promoted a supposedly licensed “cryptocurrency bank” in Miami,  the Florida Office of Financial Regulation has stated that Karatbars is not licensed as a bank with the regulator.Karatbars was also the subject of a recent consumer warning from Nambia and a prior warning in 2014 from the Netherlands.UPDATE (Nov. 15, 22:10 UTC): An earlier version of this story contained outdated information.

Research. News; Learn; Research. Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Nov 18, 2019 at 09:30 UTC","Visa, the world’s largest card payment network, has been quietly developing a blockchain system that could upend how banks transfer customer transaction data to consumer financial applications like Mint and Credit Karma.","In a paper published by Visa’s research and development arm, researchers describe a system called LucidiTEE. It outlines a system for sharing sensitive personal data on a blockchain, crunching that data within a trusted execution environment (TEE) and using history-based policies to ensure that each of the parties receive an output of the computation. (The system’s name is a combination of TEE and the word lucidity).The first application of LucidiTEE is sharing data between customers and financial apps. Such a configuration might spell trouble for aggregators like Plaid, Envestnet Yodlee, Finicity, according to people familiar with Visa’s thinking.LucidiTEE could also allow banks to share data to train machine learning algorithms for tackling fraud or keep financial data tracking apps from selling anonymized customer data to tech giants like Google. Visa did not respond to multiple requests for comment. The paper, published on the Cryptology Eprint Archive, describes LucidiTEE as “the first system to enable multiple parties to jointly compute on large-scale private data, while guaranteeing policy-compliance even when the input providers are offline, and fairness to all output recipients.”Visa was a founding member of the Libra Association until it dropped out right before the association launched. The financial services giant has also experimented with a blockchain-based business-to-business payment service originally developed alongside blockchain startup Chain. It is designed to perform international business transfers without the help of a typically slow correspondent banking network. Visa Research produces work for the entire security and cryptography community, so the research could be taken up by a rival firm. But Visa can profit off of the intellectual property in the future. The system was tested on Tendermint and Hyperledger Fabric, both available in the public domain. But it can also be used on a forkless public blockchain using a proof-of-stake consensus system, like those on Algorand or Ethereum 2.0, which is scheduled to arrive next year. While the paper is undergoing a peer review process and is subject to changes, it illustrates Visa’s desire–like most large financial firms–to be able to not have customer data touching multiple different companies and to allow consumers to get closer to controlling their data.Fintech apps have encouraged banks to work with third-party data aggregators to pull, clean and normalize financial transaction data from customers. The philosophy of the “open banking” movement is for banks to share data with fintech apps offering services direct to consumers. Data aggregators have become a key part of the banking system because millions of consumers are using applications like budget tracker Mint, micro-investing tool Acorns and peer-to-peer payment app Venmo. San Francisco-based Plaid, the largest of these aggregators valued at around $2.56 billion, powers several personal financial apps, as well as cryptocurrency exchanges Gemini and Coinbase, to be able to access consumers’ financial data. Data aggregation startups popped up as an alternative to screen scraping, where customers would give fintech applications sensitive login credentials for those apps to then scrape customer transaction data, said Brian Knight, senior research fellow in the Financial Markets Working Group with the Mercatus Center at George Mason University.Banks were still reluctant to share information with aggregators until the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act which required financial institutions to make consumers’ records available in an electronic format. Aggregators argued they were the consumer’s agent. The U.S. Treasury Department sided with the aggregators in a recent fintech report, but the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau hasn’t commented on the issue, Knight said. In place of regulation like Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), banks and data aggregators have formed informal and formal agreements about how the aggregators would handle customer data. Banks are selective about this process, however. When two parties differ on data-sharing standards, banks have been known to cut off aggregators, stopping customers from accessing financial apps.For LucidiTEE to work in the customer transaction data space, the industry would also need to adopt a common data categorizing standard that every entity would need to follow. In deciding whether or not to take the leap, banks would need to weigh the cost of sticking with data aggregators or integrating into a new system, according to Knight.  “Part of the problem with blockchain adoption is that it seeks to remove intermediaries, and while intermediaries can charge rent, they can also add value,” Knight said. After reviewing Visa’s paper, Salt Lake City-based data aggregator Finicity said the proposed system would not provide the level of service that data aggregators provide today. “It is simple when described as an exchange of data, but when you layer on the multitude of use cases, data intelligence, variances in data, security, privacy, regulation and more, it becomes much more sophisticated,” Nick Thomas, co-founder of Finicity, said in an email.Thomas said that Finicity, a founding steward of the ID-focused Sovrin Foundation, is looking at blockchain for data privacy, however. “It is always about giving consumers more granular and secure control over their financial data, and doing so in a way that they can be more informed and make smarter financial decisions,” Thomas said.LucidiTEE enforces history-based policies–similar to smart contracts but with the ability to read the entire blockchain. That ensures that, even when users are offline, their information is not computed in a way they did not authorize. The paper assumes a “malicious setting.” The system it describes uses protocols to ensure outputs are sent to every party has been given access to outputs. The blockchain would act like an escrow account where users would put the policy they’d like to enable, like sharing encrypted data to Mint in return for charts showing where the consumers spent money.According to the paper, LucidiTEE’s blockchain ensures the trusted execution environment -- an encrypted domain where computers crunch sensitive data -- only does certain computations. In this way, the company holding the TEE can’t tamper with it, and every party on LucidiTEE doesn’t have to run a TEE. The ledger then stores all cryptographic hash digests of encrypted inputs and outputs as well as what functions were run, for history-based protocols to review when the next computation is done.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Distributed ledger technology firm Perlin is providing the blockchain background to build the open-source platform, dubbed ICC TradeFlow.DBS claims the new platform will connect partners from different countries, reducing end-to-end document transit time from 45 days to just 20. A $20 million trade in iron ore from Africa to China is expected to be the first transaction processed, according to a press release.The ICC TradeFlow Platform is based on the Trade Trust network infrastructure provided by the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA), which is a statutory board under the Singapore Ministry of Communications and Information.The partners plan to add more enhancements to the platform as more countries join the new trade finance system. According to the release, the participants claim they can build a more trusted relationship between counterparties, adding more background information such as credit ratings on trade participants, vessels and couriers.The partnership could foster new innovations that can reinforce Singapore’s position as a leading commodity trading hub, said Satvinder Singh, assistant CEO of Enterprise Singapore, an agency under the Ministry of Trade and Industry in the country.Trade finance has been one of the frontiers for enterprise blockchain adoption. The trade finance blockchain Marco Polo has partnered with over 20 global banks, including Bank of America, ING and BNP Paribas. It has piloted its first trading arrangement between Germany and Russia in October.A slew of Chinese state-owned banks have also launched their own blockchain trade finance platform to facilitate short-term financing between export companies and financial institutions, and the Construction Bank, one of four major commercial banks in the country, has revamped its blockchain platform with new factoring abilities as the platform’s trading volume surpasses $53 billion overall since its April 2018 launch.Trafigura itself has been involved in the blockchain space since 2017, when it participated in the development of a crude oil trade finance platform alongside IBM, Natixis and Hyperledger.Singaporean flags image via Shutterstock"

According to Satoshi's ...","Nov 20, 2019 at 15:00 UTC","Satoshi’s Treasure, a global hunt for keys to a $1 million bitcoin prize, may offer a model for gamifying token issuance. ","According to Satoshi’s Treasure co-creator Eric Meltzer of Primitive Ventures, the tech-savvy scavenger hunt game is run through an offshore company, so that none of the people sponsoring it or arranging puzzles know the secrets behind all the keys. The first player or team to collect 400 keys, out of 1,000 potential keys, will be able to claim the bitcoin loot.Now the game is expanding beyond bitcoin.Meltzer said the Tezos Foundation has become the clandestine startup’s first client, with a side game for players to earn Tezzies starting in December. So far, Meltzer said roughly 20 percent of main-game keys have been released. All the keys should be released by mid-2020.This global scavenger hunt started seven months ago and currently has around 50,000 email subscribers, Meltzer said. This represents a slight dip from the summer, when the game attracted new backers willing to contribute prizes and key distribution. Supporters include Naval Ravikant, Balaji Srinivasan and IDEO CoLab Ventures.In the meantime, the VC-backed blockchain startup Quorum Control is launching its own text-based video game this week with more 10 keys to the Satoshi’s Treasure bitcoin prize, plus dozens of rewards related to its own native blockchain, Tupelo. The staff referred to this as an “earned airdrop,” distributing access to new or pre-launch tokens.“The business model is evolving towards helping people distribute their tokens,” Primitive’s Meltzer said. “We’re hoping to repeat that model with a bunch of other coins. … We think it’s better than an airdrop model, to have people kind of work for them.”To be clear, Quorum Control isn’t a client of Satoshi’s Treasure and hasn’t even launched a mainnet yet. However, it offers players yet another opportunity to explore gamification for cryptocurrency projects.Quorum Control co-founder Andrew Holz said this new testnet-based quest – “Jason’s Game” – was modeled after the vintage video game Zork. The game, hosted via Quorum Control’s website with an in-game crypto wallet, involves four levels with riddles and puzzles that players interact with as they would with a command-line terminal.In addition to offering winners clues to the million-dollar bitcoin prize, there are also strings of numbers and letters that go into the player’s wallet like a non-fungible token (NFT).“This [NFT] is the way to get those tokens ahead of time. Kind of like a promissory note for the tokens, a set amount of the initial supply,” Holz said of roughly 120,000 Tupel tokens that will be distributed to more than 17 winners, ranked by challenge and speed.The Tupelo blockchain, which Holz said will launch a mainnet in 2020, has a unique structure compared to networks like ethereum. These tokens won’t be distributed in a public sale, so this game is one of the few ways people who aren’t accredited investors can gain access early on. “Rather than have one big central chain that you have to put all of the information on, you actually have one for each NFT, it kind of creates its own history and you can add whatever information you need to about it,” he said. “If you were trying to do this in real-time on ethereum, the performance just wouldn’t be there.”Initialized Capital co-founder Garry Tan said his firm plans to acquire tokens as well, through its equity deal with the startup. From his perspective, this game is a way to test the technology while boosting brand awareness among crypto veterans.“With ethereum or bitcoin, everything is in the public chain, while [Tupelo] allows for flexible privacy,” Tan said. “Crypto is still at this nascent stage, we need the builders and hackers to know these are the tools to do that. … The audience of this game is exactly the right type of people.”The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

tokens being developed by the Cross-Chain Working Group.).","Nov 11, 2019 at 11:00 UTC","The Interchain Foundation (ICF) raised $17 million in April 2017 to shepherd the development of the Cosmos network, a system for making blockchains talk to each other.","Following the sale of its ATOM token, the ICF funded a cast of supporting players, like Agoric Systems Operating Company (which the ICF invested in for traditional equity) and Tendermint, to build the underpinnings of the project’s interoperable aspirations: the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol.The goal is to be well-positioned for a multi-chain future.“I could have a contract on one chain participating in selling assets on another chain, selling it to a private consortium in another stack on some other platform,” explained Agoric CEO Dean Tribble.But while the technology is still under development, the ATOMs sale has proven remunerative nonetheless.“We initiated a hedging strategy to roughly hold half the crypto in fiat,” ICF Technical Director Ethan “Bucky” Buchman told CoinDesk. “But it took us a while to start liquidating, and in a year or two, it appreciated very significantly. In our bank accounts we have more than the original raise.”The gains speak to an under-told truth of the 2017 initial coin offering (ICO) boom: Companies with conservative treasury management outperformed those who sought fast growth through marketing.Tendermint founder Jae Kwon, currently president of the Interchain Foundation, told CoinDesk ATOMs were distributed after a fundraiser, not a typical ICO. Ample documentation warned participants there were no guarantees of token receipt. However, tokens were eventually distributed to fundraiser participants as planned.“To date, we still have over 1,400 BTC, over 50,000 ETH and just over 20 million ATOMs in the treasury,” ICF director Arianne Flemming told CoinDesk.At today’s prices, that’s worth over $104 million. And that’s even after the nonprofit deployed $25 million in capital to fund over 50 projects, Flemming said.Tribble, an alumnus of Microsoft, believes making it easier for mainstream developers to write smart contracts with JavaScript will foster broader “blockchain adoption.”If Cosmos is to truly become a highway connecting distinct proof-of-stake blockchains, it’s going to need a common tongue. (This could even include a bitcoin-shaped placeholder, via the wrapped tokens being developed by the Cross-Chain Working Group.)Both Tribble and Buchman say they don’t view ICF’s ATOMs as capital; they just want to use them to participate in the Cosmos system.Buchman told CoinDesk ATOMs are merely a tool to incentivize governance participation as the network gears up to “support the interoperability the Cosmos network was envisioned for” in 2020. Right now, it’s mostly testing and the only function the network can accomplish is distributing ATOMs to participants and moving them around the network.At one point, Tendermint held roughly 8 percent of the tokens, according to head of research Zaki Manian. But he is not committed to, nor reliant upon, that network for his company to accept software development clients.“We made the software that allowed for the initial standing of the [Cosmos] network,” Manian told CoinDesk. “Whether it continues to use the software we make or pivots to someone else’s software is entirely up to the network.”Manian said Tendermint may pursue unrelated software development contracts in the near future.“I think there are many viable businesses in the Cosmos network and Tendermint could never do all of them,” Manian said, adding:“I think one downside of the Zcash approach is that by associating the brand of the [Electric Coin Company] and the open-source technology so closely together, you occupy the brand association and space around the protocol. It doesn’t create an opportunity for other companies to feel like they could own this thing.”The laissez-faire approach appears to be paying off. Nearly 30 network validators routinely participate in network upgrade votes. That ratio is far higher than the Maker Foundation’s governance system, for example, with roughly the same number of voters but more than twice the amount of contracted employees and thousands more general users.Beyond treasury management, the ICF has done a remarkable job of buying goodwill.Most notably, the ICO money wasn’t spent on marketing. (ATOMs are listed on several mainstream exchanges – including Binance – but both parties denied any solicitation or payment took place to facilitate the listing. On the contrary, Binance signaled its own interest in Cosmos by operating as a validator.)Instead, the foundation paid researchers at the University of Lugano and the University of California, Berkeley, invested in three adjacent startups such as IRISnet and donated to the public policy nonprofit Coin Center.Basically, it cemented links with like-minded companies and compensated established experts in a variety of fields for contributing to Cosmos. Plus, some of the funds went to hackathon prizes and legal fees.“We’ve heard from a few different regulators in different jurisdictions,” ICF’s Buchman said. “We’ve received some requests for information and responded quite diligently. It seems like so far we’re on good terms.”ICF and all of the above-mentioned projects still have several years of runway in the bank.Regardless of whether Cosmos eventually becomes usable for anything beyond experiments, this case highlights the benefits of separating business models from specific cryptocurrencies.  Across a variety of token-funded companies surveyed by CoinDesk in 2019, Cosmos exhibited a common theme among projects that had yet to pivot or downsize.Tendermint was founded long before the sale, in 2014, bootstrapping its way to a venture capital raise of $9 million in 2019. Its survival isn’t dependent on the price of ATOMs. Likewise, the foundation isn’t looking to the token as a long-term revenue source.With engaged and active participants like Binance, the node infrastructure provider Blockdaemon, Polychain Labs, and Bison Trails (of the Libra Association) the network has dozens of stakeholders across the blockchain industry.Yet none of them depend strictly on ATOM tokens as their sole business model.“We are exploring ways to approach financial sustainability more directly … which might include some type of revenue-generating activity, not directly within the foundation,” Buchman said. “We took a very strict policy of not engaging with exchanges about listing.”Space image via Shutterstock"

French Hill (R-Ark.) and Rep. Bill Foster (D-Ill.) in late September, Powell said the Fed has noted the efforts of other nations to explore a CBDC option, and that it continues to ""carefully analyze the costs and benefits of pursuing such an initiative in the U.S.""In their letter to Powell, Hill and Foster had expressed concerns over the potential risks to the dollar if another nation or private company creates a widely used cryptocurrency, and asked whether the central bank is look pursuing such an option.While the U.S. central bank is looking at whether a fully digital dollar would offer benefits to the U.S., Powell said the Fed is not actively developing one. Further, a digital national currency may not offer advantages to the U.S. that it may do to other nations.As an example, some countries have seen a ""rapid migration by comsumers away from cash, while demand for cash in the U.S. remains robust,"" Powell said. Similarly, payments systems in some jurisdictions may be slow and unreliable, and a digital fiat may offer an improvement for comsumers. On the other hand, payments in the U.S. are ""innovative and competitive"" and consumers have no shortage of options, according to Powell.Introducing a digital dollar would also raise ""important"" questions regarding law, monetary policy, financial stability, regulation and operations, the Fed chief said. For example, would a ""general purpose"" CBDC be classed as legal tender and what are the ""rights and obligations"" of participants in such a system? The digital dollar may also raise concerns about privacy and IT security if, unlike cash, all the Fed must maintain a record of all transactions made with the CBDC. Ushering in the new technology would also mean there would have to be decisions made over whether the digital currency would earn interest, and would its supply be capped.Overall, Powell concluded that the Fed has ""not identified potential material benefits of [a] general purpose CBDC to the implementation of monetary policy relative to our existing tools.""

By having one pre-loaded into, say, your favorite video game, Bitski says its single-sign-on wallet can move the needle on mainstream adoption.“We’re using this money to expand the funnel of people that are building on blockchain,” Bitski co-founder and CEO Donnie Dinch said of the $1.81 million in fresh capital. (The startup’s total fundraise is $3.54 million, including a late-2018 pre-seed round, Dinch said.)Bitski also announced its product is being used by a pair of game development studios, an ethereum-powered sports betting site and YouNow, the live-streaming platform behind the SEC-regulated props token.“There are a lot of projects out there that are interesting to the core crypto users but we’re trying to work on things that have broad mainstream appeal,” Dinch told CoinDesk, adding that gaming has been the company’s early focus.“We’re excited for Bitski to help catalyze the next wave of companies integrating blockchain into their products,” Winklevoss Capital partner Sterling Witzke said in a statement.The wallet’s simple UX does come with a tradeoff on self-custody, Dinch said, though the bet is most users will prefer to have a third party handling key management for them. All user wallets are stored using hardware security modules (HSMs) in “biometrically-secured” data centers, Dinch added.Compound protocol founder Robert Leshner, who participated in the Bitski seed round through his Robot Ventures fund, says the startup could be a major on-ramp for new crypto users.“Public-key cryptography is the bedrock of the growing decentralized application ecosystem – but as it stands, it’s simply too cumbersome and confusing for a mainstream user experience,” Leshner told CoinDesk via email, adding:“Bitski is a necessary experiment to (re)imagine how we interact with blockchains. They remove the friction and difficulty of wallet management, while preserving security and increasing portability.”Bitski is currently a four-person team based in San Francisco.

These bonds are normally too large for individual investors, but the quality of the bonds is attractive.The move shows Northern Trust’s continued interest in the technology after it developed then sold its private equities blockchain, which shortens the time to market for new high-tech private equity funds. With $124.3 billion in assets, Northern Trust is the 24th largest bank in the U.S.“We’re building capabilities we feel will be reusable across multiple asset classes and multiple jurisdictions,” Justin Chapman, global head of market advocacy and innovation research at Northern Trust, said of the new bond pilot. “Our focus on this initiative is to help bring the exchange to life and then we offer the highest grade asset servicing capability in that digital environment.”Through the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s Sandbox Express, BondEvalue was given permission to launch a blockchain-based bond exchange in Singapore. Northern Trust will custody tokenized bonds and conduct transactions with the regulator’s oversight. If the pilot is successful, the bank plans to also participate in the development of BondEvalue’s business model. Northern Trust image via Shutterstock"

The research and development team saw the most cuts. The company's total headcount is now 155.The downsizing will help put the five-year-old Chainalysis on the “path to profitability,” Kennedy said, allowing the company to shift resources into product teams and a go-to-market strategy.It's one of the largest layoffs in the industry since the so-called crypto winter of 2018 ended and bitcoin's price, a market bellwether, began climbing earlier this year. Circle let go of 30 employees, or 10 percent of its workforce, in May, and more recently Israeli startup Colu fired 13 people, or 30 percent of its staff.Chainalysis’ mass layoffs follow a string of seemingly positive announcements for the company, which inspects public cryptocurrency data for clues of illicit activity. One of the most well-known such sleuthing services, it is a longtime stalwart in the U.S. government's crypto investigations.The U.S. Department of Justice used Chainalysis software to take down the world's largest child pornography site last month, leading to hundreds of arrests and the rescue of 23 children.Last week the firm held its first industry conference in midtown Manhattan; a week prior it unveiled a new crypto data tool for institutional investors; and in April it closed a Series B funding round with $36 million from backers including Accel and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Japan’s largest bank.Chainalysis has raised $53.6 million total in the years since Jonathan Levin and Michael Gronager started the company in 2014. And it funneled that capital into an aggressive expansion plan that included a research and development office in London – which will remain open – and more hires. Alongside former government recruits, including a former Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) official, hired in June, and three executive-level hires earlier this month, Chainalysis boasted more than 25 open positions when it opened Series B in February.By its own count, over 140 companies (ranging from crypto exchanges to traditional banks) and 20 governments now use Chainalysis products. But market conditions necessitated early action, Kennedy said. The layoffs are a preemptive measure, meant to stave off the unexpected, including the possibility of an economic downturn, she said.“We think that acting now is best for the long-term health of the business,” Kennedy said.

Research. News; Learn; Research. Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Nov 11, 2019 at 22:15 UTC",EOS has been clogged up by a giant airdrop for a token called EIDOS – and it’s not clear the token is even good for anything.,"In fact, it seems as though the people behind the token are trying to make a point. The token seizing up the network is called EIDOS. Its promoted by a Twitter account, @enumivo, whose website only describes the token generation, not its purpose. However, its tweets appear to express discontent with the block producers running the EOS blockchain today.6 days into EIDOS airdrop and 20K users are joining it.Your CPU, your freedom. You either give your EOS CPU to freeloaders or you convert your CPU to EIDOS. The choice is yours.https://t.co/Zls95jdhTR— Enumivo (@enumivo) November 6, 2019The smart contract for went live on Oct. 31 and is designed to encourage maximum transactions. The size doesn’t matter. This has caused EOS to go into congestion mode, which Coinbase described on its blog as limiting “the amount of transactions a user can broadcast to their pro-rata share of total staked CPU resources on the EOS network.”In other words, EOS usually provides a little give when it has excess capacity (and it usually does), but that’s all been maxed out due to the demand spurred by the EIDOS smart contract.CoinDesk has previously reported on dissatisfaction in segments of the EOS community with how the chain is being managed. That said, sources in the community say it’s unclear how clogging up the blockchain up will unseat the current power structure.The Enumivo Twitter account has not replied to a request for comment from CoinDesk. On its blog, it describes vague plans for a decentralized market-maker system, of which EIDOS is said to be the beginning.“It’s a token that is pretty sparse on information, but then again that’s nothing unusual in crypto,” Aaron Cox of Greymass, a block producer candidate, explained to CoinDesk over Telegram.Sharif Boutkila, the CEO of EOS Dublin, a block producer candidate, argued that despite the technical hiccup and the mysterious intent, it may not be a bad thing for EOS. He said:“This contract is a real contract. I might not understand it or agree with it or get why people want these tokens, but they want this token. And they are using the network in order to get them and I think that has to be seen as a positive thing.”Coinbase staffers contend in their post that people want EIDOS because exchanges have listed trading pairs with USDT (tether), so it’s like getting free dollars. Yet the value of EIDOS has been tanking across the market since its debut, according to CoinGecko.The #EIDOS token on #EOS is:— Rob Finch (@finchify) November 5, 2019Sources with knowledge of EOS told CoinDesk it will probably stay clogged for possibly another couple of weeks.In the simplest terms, users are “mining” for new eidos tokens by moving eos back and forth on the network. To get eidos, users send tiny amounts of eos to the smart contract. The contract then sends back the exact same amount plus a tiny portion of the daily release of eidos.Importantly, it doesn’t appear to actually matter how much eos gets sent. What matters is how many transactions the person can submit. EIDOS is designed to generate maximum transactions. It costs users time, but not money. It’s a spam-generating machine.“What seems to be happening is people are sending these eos [coins] and sending them straight back again [after eidos returns their eos],” Bouktila explained.By giving people profit motive to do more actions rather than spend more money, EIDOS seems to have been designed to test the capacity of EOS itself.In order to do anything on EOS a user needs to stake a proportional amount of eos tokens, either to make computations (CPU), move data (NET) or store information (RAM). Early on, users directly staked for any of these things (an account could not even get registered without a little bit of eos).On their own stake, a user can only run so many transactions per day. “They’ve exhausted their own resources,” Boutkila said. That’s usually OK, though, because then a user can turn to the Resource Exchange or REX, a smart contract built by Block.One that lets users stake eos for others to use.“These rentals grant them network resources for a 30-day period, during which time the EOS Account can use those resources to perform smart contract actions,” Greymass’s Cox said. “These actions could be transferring tokens, playing games, etc. – basically any action on the network.”Users of EOS have become accustomed to making free use of unused computing power on the world’s seventh most valuable blockchain, but the gravy train has been shut down by the EIDOS token. Usually, REX gives users some leeway. They can overshoot the amount they’ve rented a bit if it has unused capacity.“The REX smart contract was set to never allow more than 80 percent of the tokens deposited into it to be rented out,” Cox said.Once the demand for EIDOS started to speed up and lots and lots of people were making these tiny transactions, REX demand went from 10 percent to over 80 percent in less than three days.“The supply hasn’t kept up with the demand,” Boutkila explained. The theory behind REX was that if it started to run out of space, the price to rent would rise high enough that more EOS users would move their stake to REX, but that hasn’t happened.Currently, said Boutkila:“Everyone can only use the amount of network resources that they have currently staked.”Critically, none of this means that EOS is inherently maxed out. It could handle much more if users would just move eos supply out of exchange accounts and onto the network, Boutkila said.“The [REX rental] rates never really got to a point that they were too good to pass up,” Boutkila said. “To me, that’s something that can be improved in the future.”There’s nothing stopping EOS users from buying tokens on the open market to make more transactions with, but the advantage of REX is that it’s less expensive than doing that.On the other hand, if all the capacity were taken off REX, in theory, prices could rise as high as they needed to. As Boutkila explained, that means that it could cost eos to rent the same amount of computing capacity a user would get for just buying one eos. Obviously, at that point, people would just stop or buy more eos, but also HODLers would move more eos into REX long before that.“It should get completely ridiculous,” Boutkila said. “The actual first fix that the block producer could do is just remove that [80 percent] cap” on REX.The trouble is that fixing things hasn’t been a priority for the latest class of block producers running the network. He lamented:“We have block producers who aren’t actively looking to see how can we fix things on a daily basis. They’re more passive, but that’s just the way it is.” Gumball machine image via Shutterstock"

But they can also use other mechanisms to ensure stability. Dai, the MakerDAO token, uses algorithms to rebalance. Bitcoin, on the other hand, trades freely.It is a distinction without a difference, according to Blanco. “Just because you say you are a banana doesn’t make you a banana,” he said.“FinCEN applies the same technology neutral regulatory framework to any activity that provides the same functionality at the same level or risk, regardless of its label. It is not what you label it, it's the activity you actually do that counts.”Blanco’s comments add legal clarity to a fast-evolving corner of the crypto space, whose recent big-name storylines such as Facebook’s Libra project attracted widespread media attention. But the stablecoin concept is not new; Blanco said Friday. FinCEN began studying stablecoins in crypto’s early days and first issued guidance on it in 2008. He said that increasing public interest warranted clarification.FinCEN’s past decisions placed money transmission service considerations on ICO issuers and most recently on some decentralized applications.The remarks Friday reemphasized a recent talking point by Blanco: there’s no excuse for non-compliance. Not in money transmission or in the requirements of Financial Action Task Force’s Travel Rule. “You can’t build a car that only goes 150 miles per hour and ask us to change the speed limit. That’s not happening. Build your car to meet the requirements,” he said.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

This application was recently granted and we are writing to let you know that you may withdraw your funds to another exchange,” the letter said.A number of restrictions apply for any former customers hoping to secure their funds. Residents of sanctioned nations must create an account at a cryptocurrency exchange that is not in Iran, Syria, Cuba or Crimea or otherwise subject to OFAC sanctions; create a Bittrex support account (using the same email as the original Bittrex account); and fill out a form denoting where to send the funds.Even then, users whose wallet balances are below the exchange’s minimum withdrawal limit will still not be able to access their funds. The minimum withdrawal amount must be three times the transaction fee, according to a May 2018 support page.Those users who are able to withdraw their funds must submit the request to Bittrex by March 15, 2020.Bittrex has previously acknowledged that residents from Iran, one sanctioned nation, were able to trade on the exchange. In April, chief compliance officer John Roth told CoinDesk that “an unintentional gap” on the platform’s compliance procedures allowed Iranian residents to participate on the platform, though no user from the country (or any OFAC-sanctioned region) had been able to access the platform since October 2017 (which is when Sadr’s account was suspended).The exchange did not disclose how many users had their accounts suspended as a result of OFAC’s actions.

Marszalek said the launch is tactical – necessary for Crypto.com’s future.“In the next bull run, the companies that will surely thrive are those that manage to build an entire ecosystem,” he said. “It’s very hard for a company that offers only one type of product to compete with companies with much broader distribution that cover each of the use cases.”At launch, the exchange will offer three trading pairs, matching CRO – the Crypto.com token – tether (USDT) and bitcoin (BTC) against BTC, ether (ETH), stellar (XLM), XRP, EOS, litecoin (LTC), MCO, CRO and USDT. The company expects to add more assets over time.It also plans to expand user access points. While the exchange is available via desktop exclusively at launch, Marszalek said mobile users – already accessing Crypto.com’s other services via a consolidated app – will get app access in early 2020.Also launched Thursday is a blockchain fundraising platform called The Syndicate that gives project builders an avenue to raise capital while keeping equity, Marszalek said. Digital asset issuers provide a certain number of their tokens to Crypto.com for a discounted pre-sale open to holders of the exchange’s native coin, CRO.“It’s a win win,” Marszalek said. “We pass on all the proceeds from such a token sale back to the project so they have a little bit of capital from this exercise.”The exchange will add margin trading in 2020 too. Marszalek said other expansions may bring a crypto collateralized “credit card/debit card hybrid” to market as well.Each works into Marszalek’s wider goal: build a Crypto.com ecosystem so comprehensive, so “sticky,” that new users sign up – and the old ones stay around.“We think we’ve nailed the customer acquisition piece and the stickiness of the product before we actually launched the exchange,” Marszalek. “This is the absolute key element.”Kris Marszalek image via Flickr/RISE"

Blockchain tech will help to make this easier, Lamborghini believes, by gathering all the partners together in one trusted distributed network.In the future, “each vehicle will come with an immutable record of service, including restoration, prior ownership and more,” and each car will be “armed against potential counterfeiting,” Salesforce said.Paolo Gabrielli, head of after sales at Lamborghini, said the automaker has always been curious about new technologies despite its long history (it was founded in 1963).“Salesforce Blockchain will allow us to take our innovation a step further, accelerating the authenticity of our heritage vehicles faster than ever,” Gabrielli said.Salesforce unveiled its enterprise blockchain platform, based on Hyperledger Sawtooth, in May. The product is provides a framework that allows customers to drag and drop ready-to-use modules to build their own blockchain networks with minimal need for writing code. Salesforce joined the Hyperledger consortium in May.“Blockchain is changing the way companies approach trust and transparency,” said Adam Caplan, Salesforce’s SVP of emerging technology. “Lamborghini is a perfect example of this – we’re excited to see how such an iconic brand is able to innovate and transform the vintage car market with a cutting edge technology like Salesforce Blockchain.”Lamborghini has now become the fourth client for Salesforce’s blockchain platform, following Arizona State University, health research company IQVIA and ratings agency S&P Global, Salesforce’s spokesperson Vince Bitong told CoinDesk."

the SEC on Wednesday.) “I would say we are far from deciding ...","Nov 21, 2019 at 09:00 UTC",Blockchain startup Blockstack is currently evaluating how to issue new tokens for general miners. ,"“The issuance of new tokens is the main issue here,” Blockstack CEO Muneeb Ali told CoinDesk. “Because within the U.S. we’re treating STX [tokens] as securities, if new tokens are being minted by the protocol and they’re being released in the ecosystem, we need a legal framework for them.”That framework could include an initial public offering (IPO), he said.In September, Blockstack became the first blockchain startup in the U.S. to raise money through a token offering approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Planning to activate the process of “mining” on the Blockstack blockchain early next year, Ali explained there are a few different ways new tokens could be issued to miners in a similarly legally-compliant and regulated way. First, the company could issue stacks (STX) tokens to miners under a Regulation S offering. Under Regulation S, Blockstack would be free to mint new STX on the blockchain and issue STX to active miners on the platform without needing to receive approval from the SEC.Granted, this also means mining on Blockstack would be restricted to non-U.S. persons and most likely locked for a period of a year and a day. “That’s one way of starting mining [on Blockstack], which won’t be ideal in the sense that we don’t want to exclude U.S. people from it,” Ali said. According to the blockchain attorney that represented Blockstack for its 2019 token offering, Robert H. Rosenblum of law firm Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, there is the possibility of offering newly issued tokens to miners in the U.S. under an alternative category called Regulation D. However, all miners under Regulation D must be accredited investors. What’s more, these investors would not be able to receive STX through mining for at least a year and a day. To avoid such complications and open up miner participation to all interested persons in the U.S., Blockstack could host a second Regulation A token offering. While this would open up miner participation to both accredited and non-accredited investors in the U.S., Blockstack would be restricted to an issuance cap.“The big problem with a Reg A offering is that you can’t sell more than $50 million worth of assets in any 12-month period,” said Rosenblum.  Once the process of mining launches on the Blockstack blockchain next year, the issuance of new STX tokens could exceed the $50 million limit, which is why Ali told CoinDesk he is considering a fourth option. That is, taking the company public. The fourth alternative is to file a Form S-1 with the SEC. This would be equivalent to conducting an IPO for the company (as several other cryptocurrency startups have attempted in the last two months.)Blockstack stated as much in its offering circular filed to the SEC in July:“We currently anticipate registering the initial distributions of mined Stacks Tokens under the Securities Act using Form S-1, with the tokens initially being delivered to a wallet that we own so that we can require miners to make appropriate securities laws representations before they receive the mined tokens, as well as ensure our compliance with anti-money laundering laws and know-your-customer requirements.”While registering STX as publicly-traded shares in the U.S. does open up participation for general mining to U.S. persons, Ali said going through with an IPO requires “a lot more work” than the other options.For starters, even with the SEC’s approval to conduct an IPO, Blockstack would likely need to receive additional state-by-state approval to issue newly mined STX tokens. While this is not a requirement of traditional securities, cryptocurrencies according to Rosenblum fall into “a strange category” of securities law requiring the approval of state securities regulators as well as federal. “It will be expensive but no one knows for sure how much it’s going to cost to deal with various states,” Rosenblum said. “No one knows for sure if every state is even going to give their approval. It’s possible that if you did a registered offering for Form S-1, you would be approved to sell in some but not every state.”Even so, Rosenblum views the approval of an S-1 for a blockchain startup as simply a matter of time given the continuous growth of the industry. Whether Blockstack will be the first U.S.-based blockchain startup to go public is an unanswered question. (Note: The INX crypto exchange filed to go public in August but its IPO has yet to be declared effective. The U.S. IPO for Chinese bitcoin miner maker Canaan was deemed effective by the SEC on Wednesday.)“I would say we are far from deciding on any option right now,” said Ali. Outside of Regulations S, D, A and taking the company public, blockchain attorney Matthew E. Kohen said there is a possibility in the long-term of U.S. regulators deeming Blockstack’s STX token as no longer a security. “At which point, a lot of these ongoing requirements Blockstack has to deal with disappear,” said Kohen. Blockstack states as much in its initial offering circular by disclosing that the company itself could determine that STX “are no longer securities for purposes of federal securities laws.” “We anticipate [this] to occur sometime in 2020 or the first quarter of 2021, within a year following the introduction of mining to the Blockstack network,” the offering circular states.How Blockstack would go about making this determination and which U.S. regulators would bless such a decision is presently unclear, Kohen said.At the same time, issuance of tokens through mining is a murky subject matter altogether, according to Rosenblum, who sees “a massive gulf” between what the SEC has said and what they’ve actually done in terms of enforcement.“It’s difficult to understand and reconcile that the SEC views most or virtually all tokens – other than bitcoin, ether, possibly EOS and a few others – as securities with their absolute reluctance and failure to take any action on all sorts of cryptocurrency issuers that do pay miners [in the U.S.] currently but have not registered those tokens,” Rosenblum said. “Where is the SEC in all of this? What are they doing?”Still, in light of what the SEC has previously done and stated especially on cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ethereum, the possibility remains for STX to one day be categorized as a commodity asset rather than a security. Even so, Ali explained that Blockstack will only activate mining under a clear legal framework in order to avoid regulatory uncertainty.“What we solved for with the Reg A was how to do an offering where the general public can participate. Turning mining on has related issues but it’s not the same problem. It’s a different problem,” Ali said. “The end framework [for mining] might end up looking different.”Update (Nov. 21, 16:02 UTC): The U.S. IPO for Chinese bitcoin miner maker Canaan opened Wednesday as this story was being prepared for publication.

Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Nov 20, 2019 at 19:00 UTC",Polymath has fallen out of love with ethereum.,"The security token issuer has migrated its Polymesh blockchain onto Substrate, the platform developed by ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood’s Parity Technologies. Polymesh becomes one of the first blockchains to make the jump. Polymath first announced it was building the Polymesh blockchain in May.As part of the transition, Parity has agreed to build certain business-logic features on Polymesh’s base layer, including smart contract communication and runtime modules, said Parity Technologies chief commercial officer Björn Wagner.Polymath’s ST20 security token (built on ethereum’s ERC-1400 standard) and native POLY token (an ERC-20) will journey over to the new Substrate-based chain, the firm's head of blockchain, Adam Dossa, said in an email. A bridge for POLY tokens will be maintained for at least one year.At the center of contention is ethereum’s consensus mechanism, proof-of-work (PoW), which only offers a statistical guarantee of transaction finality. Dossa said a different mechanism is needed for the institutions Polymath aims to serve. (Ethereum is in the process of upgrading to proof-of-stake (PoS) with a target launch date of early 2020.)“While ethereum has some great attributes, regulated assets and security tokens live in a world which quite often jar with the world ethereum lives in,” Polymath's Dossa said in a phone interview.A major issue Dossa pointed out was block reorgs, which are technically possible in PoW systems. In a block reorg, individual blocks containing transactions are rolled back to rescind a disputed transaction. However, ethereum has only experienced one reorg ever following the infamous DAO hack of 2016.For businesses working with regulated assets and security tokens, even strong statistical guarantees aren’t enough, Dossa said.“When a [Substrate] transaction is finalized, it cannot be undone,” he added.Substrate supports multiple – and even custom – consensus algorithms.How ethereum settles transactions through mining also came into consideration for Polymath, Dossa said. Since miners, who process and sign-off on transactions for a fee, can operate anywhere in the world, institutions could face government scrutiny if fees are traced back to a sanctioned country.“The mining process is permissionless. If you’re paying transactions on ethereum, you don’t really know where that transaction is going to end up. For a large institution that could be an issue,” Dossa said.It’s not just ethereum, however. Dossa said the team looked at Hyperledger Fabric, among other candidates, at the behest of Polymesh technical advisor Charles Hoskinson. Describing Substrate as a “modular, flexible framework,” Dossa said the platform beat out the competition due to the simplicity of building smart contracts from the ground up, a must for the firm.“Security tokens need to be flexible,” Dossa said. “There might be some very custom compliance logic you may need. We wanted to give people the option in a rich and flexible way.”Regarding Polkadot, which was built on Substrate by both Parity and the Web3 Foundation, Dossa said Polymath remains open to interoperability down the road.“At the moment we are focused on building the Polymesh blockchain,” he said. “Of course, we keep an eye on other types of technology. In the future, it’s something we will keep it closely under review.”The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

It’s now being tested to see if it lives up to its promise as a means to cut costs for businesses and to gauge its ability to connect with different commercial blockchain applications, MAS said on Monday.The project has been some time in the works, with the second phase of the project announced back in 2017. Earlier tests had involved MAS and a group of major banks, with blockchain startup-consortium R3 and professional services firm Deloitte also involved. Originally focused on digitization of the Singapore dollar using blockchain, the project moved on to look at the tech’s potential to support a real-time gross settlement system like those used by central banks.With Ubin now in its fifth phase, MAS said the payments prototype “will provide interfaces for other blockchain networks to connect and integrate seamlessly.” It’s also been built to offer additional benefits such as delivery-versus-payment (DvP) settlement with private exchanges, conditional payments and escrow and payment commitments for trade finance.“We hope this development will encourage other central banks to conduct similar trials, and we will make the technical specifications publicly accessible to accelerate these efforts,” said Sopnendu Mohanty, chief finTech officer at MAS. “We look forward to linking up with more blockchain networks to improve cross-border connectivity. This will be a big step forward in making cross-border transactions faster, cheaper, and safer.”With the code now developed, over 40 companies from within finance and elsewhere have been working to ascertain the commercial viability and overall value of the platform.JPMorgan indicated that work on its own blockchain initiative for internal business payments – which utilizes a dollar-pegged stablecoin – has informed work on the Ubin project.John Hunter, global head of clearing and Interbank Information Network at JPMorgan, said:“By leveraging our key learnings from building the Interbank Information Network and the JPM Coin, J.P. Morgan is well-positioned to support the development of a blockchain-based payments network and operate at scale.”Planned for early next year, professional services giant Accenture will publish a report on the project, listing the potential use cases for a blockchain payments platform and setting out additional features that could be built into the system.

America is Canada’s largest importer of oil, moving at least 120,00,000 barrels of crude oil per month through the first half of 2019, government data shows. Mavennet, however, is years away from covering that broad market. The company will use this early funding to build a proof-of concept demo for CBP. It could continue on through up to two years of demonstrations and pilot programs before field testing, during SVIP’s fourth and final phase.Patrick Mandic, CEO of Mavennet, told CoinDesk his company has been working in the space since 2015, including developing an on-chain natural gas platform for the Toronto Montreal Exchange. He said this DHS project will help further the industry:“This project is a strong building block to help a much needed digital transformation of the O&G space, which is the big picture we are after.”SVIP Technical Director Anil John explained in a statement that the Mavennet platform’s “digital auditability” could be critical as web-based identification standards continue to develop.“Accurately tracking the evidence of oil flow through pipelines and refinement between the U.S. and Canada and attributing oil imports with the accurate composition and country of origin are of great interest to CBP,” John said.The investment is SVIP’s latest blockchain space play.

Essentially, users will be able to directly access the Binance DEX using the phone.HTC decentralized chief officer Phil Chen said Binance’s “borderless vision is a cause that EXODUS also aspires to” according to a press release.“We are partnering with the biggest and most liquid crypto exchange along with the trust minimized principle of empowering users to own their own keys and run their own full bitcoin node,” he said, further suggesting that supporting the Binance DEX natively in the device might help change how users interact with exchanges.Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao said smartphones “are the most natural devices” for hardware wallets, particularly ones users will always hold onto. “Crypto, on the other hand, will make every smartphone both a POS terminal and a payment device, cutting out most other middlemen,” he said.CZ said he was “excited” to see how people might adopt cryptocurrencies using the device:“The implications are profound and far-reaching. The most innovative smartphone makers are racing to adopt crypto. We are delighted to support and work with HTC EXODUS to make sure its users can access the Binance chain and DEX to help people access crypto and exchange anywhere.”HTC first announced it would be launching a cryptocurrency-friendly smartphone last May, when it unveiled the EXODUS 1. The phone was released later in 2018, initially only available for purchase using cryptocurrency.  The company opened up fiat sales to the wider public earlier this year.Among its features, the EXODUS boasted of a “secure enclave” function to act as its mobile hardware wallet, acting as a secure environment for users to store their cryptocurrency private keys without risk of being hacked or otherwise compromised.This year, HTC followed up its EXODUS 1 offering with the 1s, a more affordable variant capable of running a full bitcoin node provided users added (a lot of) extra card storage.The new Binance edition of the device will retail for US$599, or 899 Singapore dollars, at a discount to the original price of the device.

Research. News; Learn; Research. Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Nov 22, 2019 at 21:30 UTC",JPMorgan thinks a blockchain can help it keep track of the automobile inventory it finances for car dealers – and prevent them from pledging the same cars for different loans.,"The bank’s wholesale car financing arm has filed a patent application describing a distributed ledger-based version of floorplan lending, a revolving line of credit that allows car dealers to borrow against retail inventory.Every car sold in the U.S. has an individual vehicle identity number (VIN). The bank reckons that these can be anchored to a blockchain, assisted by a range of other telematic and geolocation sensors, which can remove inefficient manual pain points around auditing inventory on the dealership floor. “The floorplan lending process involves periodically doing a physical inspection or audit of all the inventory on the dealership's lot,"" said Kevin Point, head of research and development at Chase Auto. ""That means that a human being actually travels to the dealership, identifies the vehicles and then reconciles that inventory, if the loan's outstanding, on both the dealer's and the bank's accounting system.”Banks like JPMorgan, which have been busy testing and heads-down building blockchain systems for the last several years, are now clearly looking for practical opportunities that will see their bottom line improved by the tech. About 17 million new cars are sold each year in the U.S, said Point, and when you add in used vehicles there are many millions sitting on floorplan lines of credit. Tracking them on a distributed ledger “will achieve cost savings over time. We believe these could be significant on an industry-wide basis,” he said.The move is a slight departure for the Quorum blockchain, a private variant of ethereum developed by JPM. Previously, Quorum was used solely for abstract financial operations, issuing debt or linking payment networks of correspondent banks and such like. By contrast, the new Chase Network of Assets involves verifying physical objects.Christine Moy, blockchain lead at JPMorgan, described it as a pilot in that it’s being tested with real dealership partners, but not in production yet. She also said Network of Assets could be applied more broadly, adding that JPMorgan is speaking to automakers about the blockchain system, but was not at liberty to say which ones at this time.  “Not only is JPMorgan and Chase Auto seeking to solve its own problem, basically it will benefit the vehicular and equipment industry at large,"" Moy said. ""The Network of Assets is the foundation for this particular application and use case, but can also be the foundational piece for many other value-added applications and services for auto manufacturers, other banks and finance companies, and dealerships, related to devices with telematics connectivity.""As well as allowing much more in the way of real-time risk management, the DLT system is designed to prevent a practice known as “double flooring."" ""This is when accidentally (or fraudulently) a dealership may pledge one vehicle as collateral for one floorplan contract to one bank, but also pledge the same collateral for another floorplan contract with another bank,"" Moy said.JPMorgan's idea is not entirely novel. For instance, Tata Consultancy Services, part of the Indian multinational group, has also been looking at blockchain for floorplan financing. However, JPMorgan’s Quorum efforts are well established with a vibrant community around the tech, and it also provides the potential interoperability with tokenized payment systems such as the bank's embryonic JPMCoin in a next-generation blockchain world. For now, wholesale auto financing is a solid start, said Point. “Because of the unique identifiers, telematics, the auto industry and its counterparties are a great way to get adoption out there quickly and that will drive efficiencies into different areas of finance,” he said.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

That had been scheduled for Oct. 31, but was delayed by the SEC case.“[The SEC’s] claims are without merit as Telegram’s private placement to highly sophisticated, accredited investors was conducted pursuant to valid exemptions to registration under the federal securities laws and Grams will not be securities when they are created at the time of launch of the TON Blockchain,” said Telegram in the latest filing.In its announcement of the court action, another SEC Division of Enforcement co-director, Steven Peikin, said:“We have repeatedly stated that issuers cannot avoid the federal securities laws just by labeling their product a cryptocurrency or a digital token. Telegram seeks to obtain the benefits of a public offering without complying with the long-established disclosure responsibilities designed to protect the investing public.”Telegram takes issue with this stance in the filing too, saying that the SEC has “engaged in improper ‘regulation by enforcement’ in this nascent area of the law, failed to provide clear guidance and fair notice of its views as to what conduct constitutes a violation of the federal securities laws, and has now adopted an ad hoc legal position that is contrary to judicial precedent and the publicly expressed views of its own high-ranking officials.”Telegram further claimed that it had “voluntarily engaged” with the SEC seeking guidance to avoid breaking federal securities laws. Yet the SEC “failed to provide [guidance] prior to bringing this enforcement action.”The company again stressed that its gram tokens have not yet been created, claiming that “if and when they do, they will constitute a currency and/or commodity – not securities under the federal securities laws.”Telegram conceded it didn’t file a registration statement with the SEC because “none was, is or will be required under the federal securities laws.”As such the firm asked the district court to deny the SEC’s claim for relief and dismiss the claims against it “with prejudice and order such further relief as the Court deems just and proper.”The matter will not be decided until at least Feb. 18–19, when the next hearing is to be held. The hearing had originally been slated for  Oct. 24 but the date was moved forward to allow both parties time for discovery in the case.

Additionally, the system relies on a staking model.“Orchid is a bandwidth market where node providers stake tokens to advertise their services using the Ethereum blockchain,” the company wrote in a new white paper published this week.Waterhouse said Orchid will have between five and 10 node providers at launch, including players from both the traditional VPN world and “new entrants from the crypto space.”“Our intention with this initial group was to bootstrap the beginnings of the system,” Waterhouse said.VPNs are used by millions worldwide to browse the internet anonymously and circumvent state controls over which sites can be accessed. The VPN space itself offers a stark reminder of the ills of centralized authority in the 21st century.Orchid raised at least $48 million through a series of investment rounds and SAFT deals dating back to 2017. Major investors include Andreessen Horowitz, Blockchain Capital, Polychain Capital and VC giant Sequoia.“We have known the Orchid team since 2014, and were a few of the earliest investors and advisors since the beginning of 2017,” Blockchain Capital managing partner Brad Stephens told CoinDesk. “Orchid has always been a stand-out project that perfectly illustrates the importance of decentralization. The areas of VPNs and secure communications need to be decentralized, thus supra-sovereign, in order to guarantee privacy from nation-state surveillance or interference.”But challenges remain in driving wholesale adoption of token-based platforms.A source in the investment community without any stake in Orchid told CoinDesk, “One of the major lessons learned from 2017-2019 was that utility tokens and proprietary payment tokens, like Orchid's OXT, don't provide a strong incentive to pull in millions of users, and without those users, they have a hard time capturing meaningful value.”For his part, Waterhouse says the Orchid team has been building with real-world people in mind from Day 1.“From the very beginning, we were focused on how do we build this consumer experience in the Web3 world,” he said. The goal, he added, is to “build user experiences that are going to delight and give people an easy and understandable way to control their privacy.”The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Getting it right has implications for many industries, such as restaurants, food & beverage, and retail.”It was the first time HerdX’s solution had been used to track beef with blockchain tech on this route. HerdX specializes in building blockchain-based livestock verification tools for farmers, its website shows.Used by firms as a means to verify the provenance and freshness of food products on the way to stores – as well as as a marketing method to appeal to health, environment and animal welfare-conscious consumers – blockchain tracing platforms are starting to make their way into the supply chains of major companies like Walmart, Carrefour and Cargill.The initiative adds to blockchain-based works underway by UPS, including inking a deal in March with e-commerce company Inxeption to develop a platform based on the tech to facilitate business-to-business sales. The firm has also applied for a patent for a concept that uses blockchain as part of a distributed system for sending packages worldwide.Tracking app image courtesy UPS; Japanese beef dish image via Shutterstock"

ConsenSys said Cassatt will stay on with the ethereum venture studio in an advisory capacity.","Speaking Friday at San Francisco’s TransTech Conference, Cassatt said his fund is seeking to raise $50 million for its first round. Aligned will focus on emerging technologies including artificial intelligence, healthcare, cryptocurrency and blockchain, according to a statement from Cassatt.In a blog post published Friday, Cassatt said the fund is “designed to anticipate civilization-scale, evolutionary changes in human behavior.”Also backing Aligned is DARMA Capital managing partner Andrew Keys, another former ConsenSys executive. The amount of Lubin and Keys’ capital participation was not disclosed.Although wholly separate from ConsenSys, Cassatt is looking to apply similar principles employed by his former firm, Cassatt said in a phone interview. While Aligned is still in its infancy, Cassatt said it’s looking to tackle societal issues such as safe artificial intelligence and mental health in the digital age.“Not only [are we] looking for that societal change, but [we are] noticing that institutions … are no longer serving their purpose,” Cassatt said. “I think we are at a crisis point.”Joining as an advisor to Aligned Capital is Nichol Bradford, the executive behind the Transformative Tech Lab organizing the Friday event in San Francisco. Nicholas Paul Brysiewicz, the director of development at the Long Now Foundation, is also listed as an advisor. The Long Now Foundation is best known as the entity building the 10,000 Year Clock inside a mountain in western Texas. Angel investor Seth Goldstein will be a venture partner, Cassatt said.As to the new fund’s long-term vision, Cassatt offered this:“You can come up with a lot of things as to why something would make some money.

Today’s announcement of the Series A follows Compound’s $8.2 million seed round in 2018.Much like MakerDAO’s loans, users can take collateralized loans with ethereum-based tokens, with the locked assets automatically liquidating if an independent “oracle” determines the price has dropped too low.Unlike MakerDAO loans, however, the Compound protocol supports multiple assets and allows people to lock up assets without borrowing. Because these assets are stored in a shared pool, even someone with liquidated collateral could claim tokens if they are able to repay the general pool.Compound founder Robert Leshner said that so far “teams in crypto that have stockpiles of DAI and crypto” are the most frequent protocol users. This appears to correlate with investors’ interests.Leshner said this recent round will help the San Francisco-based company further “decentralize” the protocol by setting it up so that crypto exchanges and custodians, like Coinbase, can maintain the protocol going forward.“We’re planning to integrate Compound into as many custodians, exchanges, wallets, and brokers as we can,” Leshner said, “to allow exchanges and custodians to be the interface of the protocol.”Leshner said Polychain Capital also participated in this recent venture round along with Paradigm Capital and Bain Capital Ventures.For now, Leshner said the 12-person Compound team is focused on building this public infrastructure for institutions to tap into, rather than finding a unique business model for the startup itself.“Our goal is to slowly transition the very limited functions that we control to the community over the next two years,” he said referring to exchanges and custodians. “Our highest priority is building something that is sustainable. … From there we could probably build on top of the protocol.”Whether the startup’s future is to eventually build its own monetized service or exchange, Leshner said the next focus will be on supporting multi-collateral DAI in late November.Compound founder Robert Leshner image via Vimeo"

The announcement was claimed to have come at a FOREX Club Tunisia event.But the Central Bank said that no announcement was ever made. Instead, it pointed to a CBDC test project demonstration at the FOREX event at the root of the misunderstanding:“This test of POC (Proof of concept) was taken out of context becoming a marketing operation where the name of the BCT was improperly used.”Universa’s CEO Alexander Borodich also presented the project at the Malta AI & Blockchain Summit in Malta last week. Borodich hadn’t responded to CoinDesk’s request for comment by press time.Universa, which raised $28.8 million during an ICO in 2017, has been mired in a scandal in Russia. In March 2018, Universa community manager Artur Lipatov wrote a Facebook post saying that Universa’s blockchain could not power smart contracts, the company’s operations were in trouble, and that he was leaving – that post is now unavailable.The statement dropped Universa’s token value by 20 percent from $0.037 to $0.03 and Borodich sued his former employee for $15,500 for defamation.Tunisia earlier showed some mild interest to the blockchain tech. In 2015, the country’s Ministry of Communication Technologies posted a job opening for an intern with blockchain knowledge. The same year, Tunisia’s postal service reported trialing a crypto-powered payment app.The country remains open to experiments with the tech, according to today’s statement.Tunisian flag image via CoinDesk archives"

Kik argued that this “vagueness” precluded the definition from applying to its “kin” token offering.The firm also sought to depose SEC officials in a bid to show the securities watchdog wasn’t in a position to give clear guidance on token sales at the time of Kik’s ICO.The SEC, not surprisingly, vigorously opposed the “void for vagueness” defense, stating at the time:“This defense asserts that, notwithstanding 70-plus years of well-settled jurisprudence, the term ‘investment contract’ in the securities laws is void for vagueness as applied to Kik’s investment scheme. This claim is untenable and should be dismissed.”Soon after our previous report, the judge in the case, Alvin K. Hellerstein, sided with the SEC view and refused Kik’s motion for discovery.Not only that, but Hellerstein on Tuesday threw out a subsequent motion to reconsider from the former messaging app company, tearing up Kik’s vagueness defense with the explanation:“Defendant’s motion for reconsideration is a reargument of matters that were before me when I denied the discovery sought. Defendant does not mention any new matter of fact or law, or any binding precedent that I failed to consider. That is enough to deny the motion. Furthermore, as I originally held, the deliberations within an agency sheds no light on the application of the statute or regulation in issue. If the law is vague, or confusing, or arbitrary, as defendant argues, that can be argued objectively. Proper discovery should be focused on what defendant did, and not why the agency decided to bring the case.”Last month, Kik’s messaging platform was acquired by MediaLab, a holding company with Whisper and other apps in its portfolio. Kik CEO Ted Livingstone has said the SEC action prompted the sale.So what’s next? In the latest filing, also made public Tuesday, the SEC asks Judge Hellerstein to allow it to depose seven individuals after the current fact discovery deadline of Nov. 29.These individuals include blockchain author and investor William Mougayar, kin app developer Luc Hendriks and Ilan Leibovich, who was Kik’s VP of product around the time of the ICO.

""able to classify that not as a security but as a commodity,"" he said.","Nov 20, 2019 at 16:13 UTC","Heath Tarbert, chairman of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), says it is not yet clear what sort of product Libra will be – including whether it might be a security.","Speaking to CNBC at the sidelines of the CME Group Global Financial Leadership conference Tuesday, Tarbert addressed the current U.S. regulatory stance on cryptocurrencies and blockchain, and the nation's global position regarding the technology.While CNBC originally stated that Tarbert claimed ""Facebook's Libra is a security,"" the headline was changed after publication. Rather, Tarbert only contrasted bitcoin, which the CFTC has classified as a commodity, with Libra in terms of its current stage of development.Bitcoin has been around for 10 years, is well understood, and the CFTC is ""able to classify that not as a security but as a commodity,"" he said. Libra, on the other hand, is a ""fundamentally different product,"" but currently in a state of flux.""Libra is developing and there are a bunch of unanswered questions – and also the way that it's structured, linking it directly to a set of national currencies – a very different product,"" he said.Former CFTC chair Gary Gensler has previously argued that Libra should indeed be regulated as a security.Still, a CFTC decision over Libra's status will likely have to wait until the stablecoin – which is expected by the Libra Association to be pegged to the U.S. dollar, euro, the yen, the U.K. pound and the Singapore dollar – is launched. That's slated for mid or late next year, if the project can get over the considerable regulatory pushback it's seen so far.Highlighting that it's still too early to classify the digital currency when it's still in the works, Libra co-creator David Marcus has also said that it may ultimately be split into separate stablecoins each pegged to a different fiat currency.Elsewhere in the interview, Tarbert addressed the perception that the U.S. is not seen as the global leader when it comes to blockchain regulation.""I don't think we're at the top of the list; we may not be at the bottom. I think the Libra association is a good example of this,"" he said. ""They could have chosen any place in the world to set up. They chose Switzerland. My understanding is a second choice was Singapore.""However, Tarbert said he is working to ensure the U.S. is a leader since the costs are potentially high should the nation fall behind others.""I think whoever ends up leading in this technology will end up writing the rules of the road for the rest of the world,"" he said.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Customers will be able to scan a QR code on the milk’s packaging to access a range of information.“Blockchain technology enhances transparency and advances the food transition for extremely high-quality products, which parents expect for infant nutrition. For Nestle and Laboratoires Guigoz, this innovative blockchain technology creates a new benchmark for transparency and the high standards of care required to ensure the quality of their products,” the firm said.While such schemes may have an element of marketing, there’s no doubt that breakdowns in food safety – such as China’s melamine-adulterated milk scandal and the more recently reported Polish distribution of diseased meat – have raised concerns over what we are being fed.Other major firms – like Cargill and Walmart – have moved to utilize blockchain tech ease those concerns, in theory, providing consumers with immutable proof that their food comes from where it’s supposed to and hasn’t been adulterated along the way.Back in February, French President Emmanuel Macron called for increased use of data technologies such as blockchain in the EU, in part to address concerns over food traceability.Father feeding baby image via Shutterstock"

Banks such as JPMorgan Chase and ING have used ZKPs in their blockchain forays.The catch is that ZKPs often require considerable computing power and can gum up the works.

Details of his crypto plan come near the end of the 3,500-word tech manifesto. Yang pledged to “preempt state regulations” such as the “onerous” New York BitLicense, that he said “has had a chilling effect on the US digital asset market.”  New York’s law is already leading to legislative arbitrage with far flung states, such as Wyoming, which is presenting a state-based solution to the national crypto banking registration question.  Much of Yang's crypto stance was taken from his previous campaign statements.“Cryptocurrencies and digital assets have quickly grown to represent a large amount of value and economic activity, outstripping government’s response,” he said. “We shouldn’t stifle innovation, but we also shouldn’t let it outpace our ability to regulate it.”Yang proposed defining tokens and clarifying crypto tax laws, protecting consumers and promoting competition between platforms. That means bringing legislative clarity to a technology notoriously ridden with fraud, he said. His solution: demand that the disparate parts of the American government – from tax collectors, securities regulators, legislators and agencies at large – define their stances on crypto assets, removing uncertainty that could be preventing mass adoption. The Democratic hopeful is an outspoken evangelist for cryptocurrencies and blockchain. He supports blockchain-based voting platforms, derided cumbersome regulatory schemes and lauded blockchain as “one of the key technologies.”Yang has even attended industry conferences. At Consensus 2019 he called himself a friend of the industry and pledged to support it if he were to win. “If I’m in the White House oh boy are we going to have some fun,” he said at the time. Voting for the Democratic primary begins in February 2020.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Ultimately, DLT could cut costs for issuers, investors, bond arrangers and custodians, the bank said.HSBC is already deep in the blockchain and DLT space, having launched numerous projects involving the tech and often speaking out in advocacy. Last year the bank warned that “digital islands” could inhibit global blockchain-based trade. An exec also called on the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to make more “positive noise” about DLT to encourage reluctant businesses into using the tech.While all this seems extremely bullish on the technology, Tony Cripps, HSBC Singapore CEO, argued that DLT’s potential to reduce inefficiencies in the fixed income market still has to be determined. “Only by collaborating with market participants will we fully understand its actual viability,” he said.“Having HSBC and Temasek on board will enable us to evaluate holistically whether smart contracts and DLT can solve some of the long-standing challenges in the fixed income issuance ecosystem,” said Lee Beng Hong, head of fixed income, currencies and commodities at SGX.HSBC Singapore image via Shutterstock"
