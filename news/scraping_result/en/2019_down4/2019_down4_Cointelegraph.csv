Source: Coin360Bitcoin (BTC) started the day just above the $7,600 price mark, when it suddenly started on another sell-off towards the $7,000 price level. The coin bounced off a local low of $6,800 in recent hours, before moving up to its current trading price at $7,300, showing a loss of close to 4% on the day.The world’s largest cryptocurrency is down around 15% from the weekly open of $8,500 and has dragged the entire crypto market into red territory. Bitcoin daily price chart. Source: Coin360Popular crypto analyst and regular Cointelegraph contributor Filb Filb recently said that after looking at the daily chart, “it is clear that Bitcoin has hit the bottom of the downward channel in which it has been trading since July.”However, Filb Filb pointed out that the price point of $7,600 will be a key level for the bulls to reclaim, which might turn out to be a challenge, especially in the short term. He said:“Probability would suggest BTC/USD will need to spend a little more time testing below $7,000 before there is a significant bullish reversal.”Previously Cointelegraph reported that Bitcoin tanked due to the multiple rumors currently going around about a crackdown on legitimate Chinese outposts of cryptocurrency businesses. The news appeared to rattle the crypto markets, which slipped into a downwards spiral ever since.Ether (ETH), meanwhile, saw a painful drop in sync with BTC earlier today.

Source: Coin360Over the past week, BTC/USD has faced a slow grind down to the $8,000 price level. Now, Bitcoin also broke below its 0.786 Fibonacci retracement level as well — its last major level before a confirmed full retrace of the Oct. 25 rally to $10,500. After a short bounce, Bitcoin has bounced back to around $7,600 at press time.As Cointelegraph reported, rumors of Chinese authorities raiding Binance’s Shanghai offices were likely also responsible for the drop. However, the exchange said that they had not received a notice from Chinese authorities, which required Binance to detail its activities. Specifically, a Binance spokesperson denied the rumors, saying: “Binance has no fixed offices in Shanghai or China, so it makes no sense that police raided on any offices and shut them down. [...] There has been a recent spike in the number of negative articles and activities against Binance in China. We wouldn't delve too much into what causes this, because we prefer to continue BUIDLing our solutions.”Nevertheless, after several days of choppy price action, BTC/USD finally posted a decisive drop below $8,000 falling under its 0.786 Fibonacci retracement level at $7,870 and plummeting all the way down to $7,390. This was the level of consolidation prior to the historic 42% price rise on Oct. 25.BTC USD daily chart. Source: TradingViewIf Bitcoin falls further below $7,307, it may indicate its bullish swing up to $10,500 on Oct. 25 was a fluke, resulting in net sideways action for the past month. Furthermore, a bearish outlook might even see BTC’s recent $10,500 upswing as a significant bullish correction albeit in a continuation of a general downward trend. On a bullish note, however, Bitcoin did not yet breach the previous low and bounced with a fair bit of strength from $7,390 up to $7,640. Market analyst Keith Wareing meanwhile anticipated the drop, shorting BTC to the $7.4K level, and then immediately taking a long position. “Decided that shorting to $7,350 was the logical move after the support on the Bollinger Bands was broken on all major time frames,” said Wareing. “If $7350 wasn’t to hold, Willy Woo and Tone Vays would be right, and as there are no pigs in the sky or ice in hell, I knew it was the bottom.”If Bitcoin continues to tumble, however, $7,230 may provide a bit of support. Although beyond that, not much buying strength exists before the $6K range. If $6,000 breaks as easily as it did to the upside in May, however, significant support exists between $5,800 and $5,000 as the market spent considerable time in this region earlier in 2019. Additionally, the 200-week moving average (MA) now sits at $4,890. At the bottom of the last bear market in 2018, Bitcoin’s 200-week MA acted as strong support near $3,200. BTC has not closed below its 200-week MA since 2015.   XTZ USD daily chart.

Time was limited to secure further drops, he said, due to the proximity of the halving. Most weaker miners have already capitulated due to the previous downturn, reducing the desire to further weaken the market. Regular Cointelegraph contributor filbfilb received a direct mention during the debate, thanks to the accuracy of his annual Bitcoin price outlook. For him, too, now was a time to be risk-off.“I’m totally back in cash now. There doesn’t seem to be obvious sign of reversal. Going to sit on the sidelines until there is more indication,” he told followers of his Telegram trading channel on Wednesday.As Cointelegraph previously reported, the popular Stock-to-Flow model for charting the Bitcoin price calls for an average BTC/USD value of $8,300 until May. After that, the trajectory is open for a giant $100,000 leap by the end of 2021. "

Preferably I'd want to see a tick up to like $8,800 to confirm a slight trend reversal (like scenario),” he said in a Twitter update on Thursday.Continuing, van de Poppe added downward pressure could take Bitcoin the other side of its pre-halving average: “If not, this slow bleed could accelerate to $8,200 as the next level.

Source: TradingViewAlongside with a drop below the crucial moving averages, the price of Bitcoin wasn’t able to break the downward trendline. This trendline started at the top at nearly $14,000 in June.Breaking the trendline would provide a vital sign for bullish perspectives on the market.  Additionally, the $7,300 level showed bottom signals with bullish divergences and a falling wedge structure, which resulted in the historic surge to $10,500.However, this push couldn’t close above the crucial $9,500 resistance area and caused the price to retrace further downwards to the yellow zone. This yellow zone is classified as a potential support area since it previously served as resistance.BTC USD 12-hour chart. Source: TradingViewHowever, the price of Bitcoin is currently hanging on a few key levels. First, it’s the previous resistance area seen in October, which can become support if buyers step in here. But the price also retraced towards the golden ratio (0.618-0.65 Fibonacci level) of the whole upwards push from $7,300 to $10,500. This means that bulls must now step in to reverse the downward trend seen so far this month.BTC USD weekly chart. Source: TradingViewThis current market cycle is still showing many similarities with the previous one, i.e. a breakout from the bear market, causing the price to move from $3,100 to $13,900. This parabolic move has led to a range-bound period and accumulation at higher levels suggesting that a breakout before the next halving is possible. During the last few months, the same movements occurred as the $7,300 level was marked with similar bullish divergences. This also marked the “low range” of the range-bound period, marked green in the chart.But does this mean further bullishness is warranted? No, because in the short-term, the price is retracing. However, this is a natural move for an asset that pushed 42% overnight on Oct. 25.As long as the green area holds as support and the price is moving above the 100-Week MA and EMA, investors don’t have anything to worry about. In fact, a potential bullish cross of these two moving averages is likely to occur, which was also a bullish signal in the previous market cycle.Total crypto market capitalization daily chart. Source: TradingviewThis chart is showing a clear breakout of the cryptocurrency markets at the end of October, as the falling wedge broke upwards. The bullish divergences were similar to the breakout in December 2018, which marked the bottom of the bear market of 2018.Right now, consolidation is needed and backtesting levels must flip to become support. As the chart shows, the red area around $220 billion must turn into support to continue the bullish trend.Another similarity with February 2019 is that a significant retracement also occurred before continuing to the upside.BTC USD 3-hour chart. Source: TradingViewSmaller time frames still show that the downtrend since Nov. 5 is still intact. Additionally, previous support levels are now becoming resistance.For example, $9,050 was broken as support, which caused the price to drop to the next support level at $8,700. This leads to a retest of the previous support at $9,050, only to confirm that it flipped to become resistance.In downtrends, this is a continuous movement and, unfortunately for the bulls, this is still occurring on the smaller timeframes.BTC USD bullish scenario. Source: TradingViewTherefore, bulls must break out of this downtrend, preferably with a double bottom confirmation or bullish divergences. After that, a breakout above $8,700 is needed in order to flip that resistance level into new support.The yellow zone is crucial here and needs to hold (as this is also the golden ratio), followed by a clearcut break of the $8,800 area, preferably with high volume.BTC USD bearish scenario. Source: TradingViewNevertheless, as short-term momentum is still favoring bears, a continuation of the downtrend is more likely to occur. In this regard, a few scenarios are possible for a bearish outlook, which both lead to the same lower level.In the first scenario, the price is unable to break out of this short downtrend and falls below the yellow zone and golden ratio. A potential bounce upwards could then provide a short opportunity. However, testing the green area around $7,400 is most likely to occur in such a move.BTC USD second bearish scenario. Source: TradingViewThe second scenario has the same conclusion as the first one, but a different approach. Here, the price is able to break out of the downtrend but lacks volume and is not able to go beyond $8,700. Such a fakeout often leads to a sharp dump during which bounces will also provide some good opportunities for shorting.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

According to the CEO it was a question of “where do we want to put our attention, and what do we want to do today to advance our mission?” He added:“You know, we think if we focus on our own roadmap, we’d be able to advance financial inclusion faster than if we put all these resources against Libra.”Schulman added that Libra will start going down a road that his company remains “very interested in looking at,” and once Libra starts to figure things out, “we’ll take another look at where they are.”At the beginning of October, a PayPal spokesperson told Cointelegraph that the company had officially left the association, adding that they remain supportive of Libra’s aspirations and continue to look forward to dialogue on ways to work together in the future. PayPal’s CFO John Rainey said in May that the firm has teams that are working on blockchain and cryptocurrency, and that they wish to participate in that technology in whatever form it takes in the future. In the Fortune interview, Schulman was reluctant to share any significant details as to what exactly PayPal is working on in the sphere, although he was quick to point out that it is not “necessarily competitive with Libra,” adding:“We think there’s a lot of promise to blockchain technology. It’s intriguing to us, but it really needs to do something that the traditional rails can’t do. Most people think that blockchain is about efficiency, but the system today is pretty efficient.”Regarding cryptocurrencies, the CEO said that it is still very volatile, and that they do not have much demand for it by merchants because merchants operate on very small margins. He said:“Until it becomes less volatile, it won’t be a currency that is widely accepted by merchants on the web — not the dark web, but the web.”As to whether he owns any cryptocurrencies himself, Schulman’s answer was short and straightforward:“Yes, Bitcoin. [...] Only.”"

Source: TradingViewBitcoin has been trading hard up against historical weekly support and resistance at $9,550.  This also coincided with the 100-day moving average (DMA), unable to establish any kind of sustained attempt to break above. The pinch between the 100-DMA acting as resistance and the 200 as support, led to a failure and an immediate drop through the volume gap where price doesn’t have much local history.  The 50-DMA and the previous range high have subsequently come to support price above the 61.8% retracement from the move up to $10K from the mid $7K lows.This is a technical trading area, which will be of interest to some profit takers and buyers. If Bitcoin is to maintain a move higher in the near term, we should expect to see BTC attempt to retake the previous support at $9,000.  The bearish case for bitcoin is that this is simply the first leg lower after a failed move higher off the back of a news event. Failed moves often lead to fast moves and, as we have seen, Bitcoin has fallen out of support.Bitcoin has a well-defined topping pattern that has clearly broken down, called Adam and Eve.  The measured move target for such a pattern is 100% of the V-shaped “Adam”, which would take Bitcoin down to a price in the low $8,000s and back to the point of volume control in recent times. A move back here would also go back between the 61.8% and 78.6% retracement, which is an area of potential buying interest for bulls looking to reaccumulate, having either taken profits on the move higher or simply looking to take their technical profits off the breakdown. This pattern would be invalidated if Bitcoin can break and reestablish price action above the previous support level of $9,000.BTC USD 4-hour chart. Source: TradingViewThe bullish case for Bitcoin is that a reasonably sharp reaction has been seen by the bulls who have stopped price dead so far following the breakdown.If the bulls can establish support here, it is possible that the move lower was simply an inevitable stop run that occurred due to leveraged long positions being taken on by overly enthusiastic traders who were in fear of missing out on a higher Bitcoin move.BTC USD 4 hour chart. Source: TradingViewAn early sign if this was simply a stop run and for Bitcoin to attempt a significant move higher will be if the bulls can take advantage of the typically low volume weekend retaking $9,000 as support.  This would give a high probability of a retest of at least weekly resistance at $9,550, if not $10,000.This will be an important weekend for Bitcoin, which could easily lead to further volatility. Reclaiming the $9K range is a clear objective for the bulls over the weekend. Otherwise, a more extended period consolidating likely lies ahead in the $8,000s.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

Following the purported handover, Bilyuchenko was delivered to an FSB department in Moscow, where several plainclothes officers questioned him about WEX operations.The following day, Anton allegedly demanded that Bilyuchenko passed on all cryptocurrency stored in WEX’s wallets, stating that the assets will be given to the “fund of FSB of Russia.” At the time, the wallets contained $450 million worth cryptocurrency, part of which belonged to the exchange’s customers.Bilyuchenko eventually agreed to transfer the aforementioned amount. The data from Blockchain.com and Explorer.Litecoin.net indicated that 30,000 BTC and 700,000 Litecoins (LTC) were transferred from the aforementioned wallets — equivalent to $350 million at the time.In July, Dmitri Vasilyev, former CEO of WEX, was arrested in Italy. In April 2019, Vasilyev became the subject of a criminal investigation by the police department in Kazakh city Almaty, as the alleged suspect was charged with defrauding a local investor in the amount of $20,000 through WEX exchange.That same month, United States prosecutors filed a complaint against BTC-e and Vinnik. Per the filing, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) determined civil penalties for BTC-e and Vinnik last year, who face fines of over $88 million and $12 million, respectively.The filing stated outright that BTC-e and Vinnik had not attempted to register with FinCEN, implement Anti-Money Laundering practices, or report suspicious activity generally."

Source: Coin360BTC USD daily chart. Source: TradingViewThe price has pierced the $8,674 support three times over the past 4 days, increasing the chance that the price will drop to the lower trendline of the falling wedge at $8,480. The daily chart shows that Bitcoin had spent the week riding along the 200-DMA, a point which was lost earlier today. The volume profile visible range (VPVR) shows a volume gap between $8,780 and $9,062, meaning the Bitcoin could rally 3.45% to $9,062, a point which would bring the price above the 50-DMA and slightly below the Bollinger Band indicator moving average at $9,121. A move to $9,148 would set a 3-day higher high at the 100-DMA, bringing Bitcoin price out of the falling wedge and possibly serving as the first indication of a short-term trend change for investors. A pop above the falling wedge resistance would bring the price above the 50% Fibonacci retracement level, a point thoroughly discussed in a previous analysis. BTC USD daily chart. Source: TradingViewA move to the Bollinger Band indicator moving average at $9,121 would also bring Bitcoin price to the 61.8% Fib retracement level from the Oct. 25 move from $7,400 to $10,540. Bearish traders are calling for a much more significant drop and taking a bird’s eye view of the rally from $3,127 to $13,800 shows that the 61.8% Fib retracement level is situated at $7,840. BTC USD daily chart. Source: TradingViewThis point is also strongly supported (3rd pink bar) and failure to bounce at this point could see the price sink as low as $6,846, the lower trendline of the larger descending channel beginning at the 2019 high. Bounces from this trendline have been strong and previous analysis and the VPVR suggests the $8,300 to $7,800 range as a possible support area where buyers are expected to show interest.Taking a macro view of Bitcoin’s price action on the daily timeframe (chart above), further downside moves in the falling wedge could see the price drop to the support levels (pink bars) at $8,591 and $8,305. In the event of a falling wedge breakdown, the price could drop to $7,862 but before this happens it’s probable that buyers will have stepped in around $8,300 and $8,000. BTC USD 4-hour chart. Source: TradingViewAt the time of writing, the 50-day moving average (DMA) and the 200-DMA are converging on the 4-hour timeframe, forming the oft-discussed dreaded death cross that traders have worried about at length over the past two weeks. On the 6-hour (or one can view the 4-hour chart above) timeframe traders will spot a divergence within the relative strength index (RSI). Given that falling wedges have a tendency to flip bullish, some traders might interpret this divergence as additional proof that Bitcoin could be on the verge of a trend reversal. Possibly, Bitcoin’s price will continue its current trend, bouncing off the support and resistance line of the falling wedge until price reaches the second (pink bar) support at $8,300 where buyers might show up to push the price back to $8,650. As mentioned earlier in the analysis, a high volume spike could see the price rally to $9,060, which would be a 9% gain from $8,300. Given that Bitcoin’s trading volume has reduced to a trickle and the current price action looks bearish until $8,373, traders are likely in cash, waiting to see if they can catch a bounce at $8,460 and $8,300. The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author (@HorusHughes) and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

to open a long position at $6,900. 14285 Total views. 127 Total ...","Nov 23, 2019","This has been a mixed week, with some small gains and losses on Bitcoin (BTC) longs and small earnings on alt trades which I will discuss in the coming weeks. I would like to take this opportunity to explain a few things about my trading style and approach in general, as it can be confusing for many.","First, I do not short Bitcoin. This is not because I have no desire to look for short positions, but because I am American and cannot legally trade on leverage exchanges that offer Bitcoin shorts. The only exchange where I can legally short is Kraken, which is notorious for huge wicks on candles that don’t exist on other exchanges. I will not trade anywhere that my risk management strategy cannot be properly executed - so long wicks that stop out traders who would otherwise be fine elsewhere are not acceptable for me.That said, I only look for long entries, which is not an ideal situation, as it forces me to trade against the trend when I want to enter a position. I am comfortable with this because I have a proven and well-defined trading system. It allows me to take many small losses, compensated for by a couple of large gains a year.This works for me but is unlikely to work for another trader who does not fully understand my situation and system. To that end, nobody should copy my trades, or anyone else’s. The responsibility to develop and enact a system is yours, and your system will be a result of your own financial situation, timeline, and expectations.It is also important to note that I only trade with a small percentage of my overall portfolio. I only trade 15% of the funds allocated to my crypto portfolio and my total crypto allocation represents only 10% of my entire investment portfolio. As I often say, I plan my losses, expecting some of the trades I make to go against me. As such, I am comfortable losing my entire trading portfolio, and it would not have any effect on my life. That is my system.I would also like to drop a quick note about longing and shorting cryptocurrencies. In my opinion, longing is potentially far more profitable and less risky than going short on Bitcoin, or any other asset. I recently tweeted about this and was a bit shocked at the lack of understanding of this concept amongst traders that are actively shorting with leverage.At the core, a zero leverage short’s maximum earning potential is 100% if the asset goes to 0. You cannot do better than doubling your money. The theoretical upside of a long position is infinite. That is why a short from the Bitcoin top at $20,000 all of the way to the low of $3,200 was less profitable than a simple long from $3,200 back to $6,400. Beginners should not short, they should buy dips in an upward trending market.As discussed in the last journal entry, I opened a Bitcoin position at $8,375. The price rose immediately, so as I usually do, I moved my stop loss up. I ended up stopping out at my entry price and broke even.I also took another position as price continued down, at $8,010. Price retraced to the 78.6% Fibonacci level, a very deep retracement relative to previous corrections. This seemed like a reasonable place for a bounce. There were also clear bullish divergences on all time frames from 6 hours down, which ultimately failed.BTC USD 4 hour chart. Source: TradingViewThe most compelling reason for a long position in this area was the potential “bullish breaker” shown in pink. This was an area of supply that was blown through in a single candle. These zones are often retested as support - known as a bullish breaker when they are successful. I stopped out when the price failed to hold this level, at $7,900 for a position loss of roughly 1.4%.BTC USD 6 hour chart. Source: TradingViewI took another Bitcoin position at $7,420 when the price arrived at the next zone that I had outlined. It did so in spectacular fashion, effectively going from zone to zone in a single 4-hour candle. I immediately moved my stop loss up to $7,500 when the price crossed $7,600. I soon stopped out with a small profit of 1%.BTC USD 4 hour chart. Source: TradingViewI am presently long Bitcoin once again from $6,900. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the 4-hour chart is at historic lows, touching 6.02 today before rising slightly.

After all, Bitcoin (BTC) price was $9,300 last week, which is $200 higher than it is now. So let’s take a look at some of the factors causing, and fuelling these swings.Daily crypto market performance. Source: Coin360.comBitcoin price (BTC) took a dive from $9,265 and closed at $8,804.88 on Friday, November 8th, in what is becoming quite the predictable event, the CME Gap.Last week many traders were screaming for $8,885 to be filled, and even though this is becoming quite a regular thing, world-renowned Bitcoin hater, Peter Schiff took to Twitter to call for a dump in Bitcoin price. Schiff tweeted, “It looks like the #Bitcoin pump is finally over. Get ready for the dump!”Of course, one only has to look at the engagement Mr. Schiff receives on his anti-Bitcoin crusade to see that he gets 14 times more interaction on his crypto tweets than he does on his dreary tweets about gold.Outside of Schiff’s ever dreary tweets, the situation seems to be improving for Bitcoin. The CME gap has been filled so what can traders expect from Bitcoin over the coming week? BTC USD daily chart. Source: TradingViewThe Bollinger Bands indicator on Bitcoin’s daily chart shows that the price has been hovering around the moving average (MA) which is now near $8,900 since the CME gap was filled.When the price is set so close to the middle of the indicator traders could be fooled into thinking the odds of falling to the support at $7,800 are equal to the odds of the price rising to the resistance of $10,130. Fortunately for the bulls, there are quite a few factors that suggest the price is more likely to rise over the next week rather than fall.The first thing to consider is that the CME gap is something of an anomaly unique to the Bitcoin price action. As such, the Bitcoin price usually recovers almost immediately after it’s filled. So why hasn’t it bounced back after shedding $500 off the Bitcoin price nearly 3 days on?Bitcoin Historical Price Data. Source: CoinMarketCapThis question can be answered quite easily as one only needs to look at the trading volume of Bitcoin on weekends compared to weekdays to see that the volume is much thinner on Saturdays and Sundays compared to the working week.As such, it would be entirely plausible to consider that as the markets open across the world on Monday, trading volume for Bitcoin will increase, and this would be a key factor in driving the price. But forecasting volume alone, cannot guarantee an increase in price, so to find more reason for this, one must also take a look at a couple of proven indicators to better gauge the next move. Bitcoin Weekly Trading Volume. Source: Bitcoinity.orgBTC USD weekly MACD. Source: TradingViewOut of all the technical indicators available, the Moving Average Divergence Convergence (MACD) is the one to watch on the weekly timeframe. The price dump on Nov. 8 caused the oscillator to alter its trajectory ever so slightly, however, thanks to Sunday’s price rally, it seems increasingly probable that a bull cross could occur in the next 2 to 3 weeks if not sooner.When the MACD crosses bullish on this time frame, Bitcoin never fails to impress, as such this is a huge buying signal to traders. As mentioned earlier, it’s still not quite there yet, however it is on another popular crypto asset.ETH USD weekly MACD. Source: TradingViewLast week’s analysis covered a similar scenario for Litecoin (LTC) and since then the altcoin increased by 13%, rallying from $57.64 to $64.27 within just 4 days. Right now, Ether (ETH) is looking almost identical from a technical perspective, with the only difference being the fact that the digital asset could catalyze a number of altcoins to rally due to their pairings across many exchanges.Therefore, it’s safe to ask, Is this the start of the next altcoin season? Let’s take a look at where Ether price could goETH USD weekly. Source: TradingViewIf Ether were to rally, this would be a welcome pump. Assuming that Ether tallied the same percentage of gains that Litecoin experienced last week, the price would sit $5 above the moving average on the Bollinger Bands indicator. This could set Ethereum up for a run-up to around $285 which wouldn’t just bring the Ethereum market capitalization up by 30%, it would also potentially have a huge knock-on effect with ETH-paired altcoins which could trigger a retail FOMO phenomena similar to the one seen in 2017.Bitcoin needs to fend off a few areas of support. Should the current support of $8,900 fail to hold, it opens up a new level around $7,800 that needs to be defended. One would hope that the days of seeing the Bitcoin price at this level are over for 2019, however, it was only a few weeks ago that the majority of Bitcoin bears on Twitter were calling for $6,000 Bitcoin this year. Should $7,800 fail to hold, this could then become a reality.As the weekly candle closes, it is likely to send a strong buy signal to traders. Bitcoin has to first break $9,900 before investors and traders alike can expect a 5 digit Bitcoin. Should Bitcoin price exceed expectations and march past $10,000 to find support above $10,130, then the digital asset will be set for a bullish MACD cross in the immediate future. This could be the push Bitcoin requires to achieve a new all-time high.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the @officiallykeith and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

Therefore, these metrics must rise to produce an upward surge in Bitcoin’s price.Bitcoin: Adjusted Volume (Total). Source: glassnode.comNevertheless, a recent tweet from the analytics firm also pointed out that the investors’ interest in holding Bitcoin is growing and this claim is supported by the Bitcoin: Spend Output Age Bands (SOAB), which shows that approximately 80% of the Bitcoin “transacted daily are less than 1-week old”.The chart also shows that many long-term holders capitulated in 2018, as evidenced by the long purple “flames” on the chart. Notice that this phenomenon is absent throughout 2019.Bitcoin: Spend Output Age Bands. Source: glassnode.comFurther proof that — despite Bitcoin’s currently bearish price action — interest in purchasing and holding grows comes from the adjusted spent output profit ratio (ASOPR) and the Spend Output Profit Ratio (SOPR).The ASOPR ignores all transaction outputs with a lifespan of less than one hour, whereas the SOPR calculates profit ratio by dividing the realized value of Bitcoin by its value at creation. As explained by SOPR creator Renato Shirakashi:“SOPR appears to oscillate around the number 1. Secondly, during a bull market values of SOPR below 1 are rejected, while during a bear market values of SOPR above 1 are rejected.”Bitcoin Adjusted Spent Output Profit Ratio. Source: glassnode.comglassnode points out that:“SOPR below 1 shows that more spent outputs are at a loss than in a profit [and the] SOAB suggests that SOPR deltas are currently due to short term $btc holders. As they realize their gains or prices increase, SOPR slowly recovers to 1.”Glassnode’s assessment makes perfect sense. Less than two weeks ago Bitcoin price skyrocketed from $7,400 to $10,540 and whether or not this was driven by President Xi Jinping’s blockchain announcement remains a topic of deliberation. But the profit-taking by short term investors and a drop in trading volume as sentiment and momentum wanes is to be expected.Bitcoin Spent Output Profit Ratio. Source: glassnode.comWhen set on the one-year time frame, using the 7-day moving average, traders can see that the significant dips below 1 on SOPR were all fantastic purchasing opportunities when the price peaked and began to curve above 1.01.This typically signaled that Bitcoin price rallies have become overextended and matching these dates against the traditional Heiken Ashi charts and oscillators like the relative strength index, stochastic RSI and the moving average confluence divergence showed overbought readings.According to the SOPR, even the most recent dip to $8,600 could have been a good time to “buy the dip” and currently the SOPR line is beginning to curve up form 0.99561092 to reapproach 1.0 where it last was on Nov. 3 when the price was near $9,400.Ultimately, traders should pay more attention to the data produced by blockchains and consider incorporating some of the valuable data produced from on-chain activity to their trading routine.At the moment, the traditional Heiken Ashi charts suggest that Bitcoin is bearish over the short term but on-chain data tells a different story.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author (@HorusHughes) and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

I don’t believe in institutional adoption. If this happens, Bitcoin will become not censorship-resistant. Then it won’t have this feature anymore and will crash to zero.” Institutions’ role in Bitcoin trading and investing continues to form a point of debate among market participants and experts. This year, new offerings have surfaced, with Bitcoin futures and custody solutions attempting to woo major players.Some have warned about the detrimental impact of institutional involvement, while others are bullish about the future. As Cointelegraph reported, venture capitalist Mike Novogratz highlighted trading platform Bakkt in particular as having the potential to boost, not crash, the Bitcoin price. On the BlockShow panel, Matthew Rosak, CEO of enterprise blockchain startup Bloq, added that store-of-value use case for Bitcoin was furthering the appeal of the industry as a whole.“Bitcoin as a store-of-value continues to be a freight train of momentum,” he said.Conversely, Kravchenko argued governments trying to ban Bitcoin altogether would help the price more than institutional acceptance. As a currency, Bitcoin must attempt to become more private — and introduce anonymizing features such as those in Zcash or Monero — or it will lose its censorship resistance feature, he added."

AntFinancial controls Alipay, one of China's leading payment systems, and is valued at $83 billion.Among the companies that offer innovation through blockchain and cryptocurrency, JD Finance was best placed in third place, surpassed by Grab, an Uber-like rideshare app that also functions as a payment system in Singapore.Robinhood dropped from 8th place in 2018 to 14th in 2019. However, crypto innovation remains strong according to KPMG’s rankings, which featured blockchain-focused OneConnect (18th), Revolut (26th), Coinbase (34th), Liquid (38th) and Banketa (42th).Commenting on the strength of Chinese companies on the list, Chris Wang, partner and head of fintech at KPMG China said:""As fintech development continues to go strong in China, we are seeing some changes in China's fintech landscape. Aligned with trends we observe globally, we see an increasing number of wealth, insurance and multi-sector companies in China on the list, which indicates that technologies and innovations have spread into more financial services sectors.""The report also named Binance, MemaPay, Moin, Silot and Tokeny among emerging companies in the top 100.KPMG further points out that Fintech100 companies raised over $18 billion in the last 12 months and more than $70 billion in their lifetimes. The report identifies these companies as changing the world with their respective innovations, serving over 2.5 billion customers globally.Although fintech firms have emerged as a financial services option, KPMG points out that many companies on the Fintech100 list have benefited from open banking, allowing them to access customer banking to create more personalized experience and services. Early fintech innovators with single product propositions are now diversifying to fulfill customer needs, often through banking licenses and supported by favorable regulatory developments."

He added:“We think of [BTC] in our portfolio as it goes into our venture portfolio. [...] It is a venture that aspires to become digital gold, and is showing great promise of doing that. Because it hasn’t done that yet [...] there is a lot of upside, but also downside.”(5:35) Travis Kling gives perhaps the most direct answer when he says that Bitcoin is a risk asset, one with specific investment characteristics “that become increasingly more attractive the more irresponsible monetary and fiscal policy is from central banks and governments globally,” adding:“Investors in BTC today aren’t investing in Bitcoin as a store of value today, we’re speculating that it may become a store of value because it has the characteristics to be a good store of value.”(11:00) Kling further points out that if the United States was still on the gold standard, and was balancing its budget every year instead of spending a trillion dollars more than they collect, “we might not need Bitcoin so much.” However, as Kling puts it, “that ain’t the world we’re living in.”In November, the head of the United States Federal Reserve Jerome Powell noted that currently, U.S. national debt is growing faster than nominal GDP. He admitted that the current economic policy is not sustainable, but that it is not its job to fix it. “Ultimately in the long run that’s not a sustainable place to be,” he said. U.S. debt has now topped $23 trillion, which adds up to $70,000 per head of the population, or more than $1 million for every Bitcoin that will ever exist."

While around fifty times lower at present, Lee thinks a reversal could come as soon as 2028.“I predict the #flippening will happen within 9 years and $BTC will shoot up past USD $500,000,” he wrote. Like many, Lee based his argument for Bitcoin’s success on its decreasing supply via block reward halvings. He noted that in the next decade, the amount of Bitcoin released to miners each block will halve three times. Lee added:“By 20th year, daily new output will just be ~255 BTC — yearly inflation of less than 0.5%. More scarce than #gold!” His arguments chime with predictions by a well-established model charting the Bitcoin price — Stock-to-Flow. The product of social media analyst PlanB, the instrument likewise uses Bitcoin’s new supply versus its existing stock to forecast its future value. As Cointelegraph reported, calculations call for a BTC/USD price of just $8,300 until the next halving in May 2020. After that, however, the situation should change rapidly, with $100,000 coming around two years later. Lee also joined PlanB in predicting far higher Bitcoin prices in the latter part of the next decade or beyond. While the former thinks a $1 million price tag is possible in the event of global money printing continuing, PlanB noted that money printing could ultimately stop the Stock-to-Flow model from working.“I would be happy if the model holds for 1 or 2 or maybe 3 more halvings. Especially since BTC is measured in $ … who knows what happens with $ if the FED keeps doing more QE (money printing),” he said in a Twitter exchange late last month. The idea of Bitcoin usurping gold as an alternative store of value still has its major detractors. Among the most vocal is Peter Schiff, the gold bug who has become infamous for his social media slighting of both Bitcoin and its proponents. Last week, Schiff argued that China potentially backing its state-issued digital currency with gold was a “bearish” sign for Bitcoin. Prior to that, he forecast BTC/USD never reaching $50,000, while gold would pass $5,000. Equally vocal about Bitcoin meanwhile is Max Keiser, the RT host who continues to argue for the cryptocurrency’s supremacy on mainstream media. In an episode of his Keiser Report last week, he said that Bitcoin’s self-settling ability automatically made it more suitable for transactions than either gold or fiat currency."

An excerpt reads:“FirstRand Bank has been considering its risk appetite in respect of virtual currencies and virtual currency exchanges for some time. Within this context the bank has taken the decision to discontinue the provision of banking services to virtual currency exchanges and/or entities dealing/trading in virtual currency. Future regulatory clarity may cause us to revise our decision.”South Africa continues to enjoy a surge in cryptocurrency interest as its currency wavers. As Cointelegraph reported, peer-to-peer platform Paxful alone reported a 2,800% volume increase last month. Commenting on the banking loss, Reitz meanwhile said Luno was not concerned and that other lenders were still prepared to service the business.“We do not anticipate any impact to our existing customers as we have other banking relationships in place to support deposit and withdrawals on the platform,” he added.Last week, popular adult entertainment website Pornhub faced a total embargo on payments to its 100,000 models due to a snap decision to end support from PayPal.

Source: Coin360BTC USD daily chart. Source: TradingViewOn its daily chart, Bitcoin sank all the way down to $8,550 on Nov. 12 where it bounced off its 50-day moving average (MA) as support. Crypto’s main asset bounced near the 50-day MA two other times recently, on Nov. 8 and 11, indicating the average may be an area of significant interest for buyers. After the bounce near $8,550, Bitcoin rallied more than $250, closing the day near $8,825. $8,825 is the location of Bitcoin’s 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level and when taking into account that its recent low near $7,300 and its swing high near $10,350. This level acted as resistance during Bitcoin’s Nov. 12 close and has continued to reject the asset’s price action on Nov. 13. Bitcoin sits a considerable distance away from $9,275, the current location of its 200-day MA. The coin held the 200-day MA as strong support for numerous days, although the level finally broke down on Nov. 8. Bitcoin’s chart also still shows a death cross, with the 50-day MA firmly below the 200-day MA, providing a signal of bearishness. BTC USD 4 hour chart. Source: TradingViewBitcoin’s 4-hour chart reveals significant wicks in price action. These wicks likely triggered many stop-losses, also referred to as stop-loss hunting or stop-runs. This type of market behavior can sometimes be indicative of low volume trading. Long wicks can also be accompanied by Bart Simpson patterns — price action which sees an asset’s price sharply rise, followed by a period of low volatility and an eventual sharp move in the opposite direction, painting an outline of the head of the popular yellow cartoon character of the same name. Inverse Bart patterns also occur, posting the same type of price action, except in the opposite direction. The chart above shows an inverse Bart pattern in the middle of the green Ichimoku cloud. Bitcoin could complete another inverse Bart pattern with a swift move up from the current price. The Ichimoku cloud holds as resistance at $8,822, above Bitcoin’s current price. Recent wicks also saw rejection from the Tenkan, which now holds near $8,845. On the daily chart, Bitcoin needs to hold its 50-day MA as support, as it has done three times already. A break of this level could lead to further downside, as well as another resistance point for future price action. The asset’s price is also below its 200-day MA. Historically, this is not a bullish signal, especially when coupled with the MA’s positioning above the 50-day MA. The 4-hour Ichimoku cloud has also held as a bearish level for multiple days. If the bulls continue to face rejection, a breakdown may follow. If Bitcoin can break above its 200-day MA once again and hold it as support, the market may be able to gain further upward momentum. The 50-day MA crossing above the 200-day MA in a golden cross would also likely give further rationale for bullishness. Additionally, if Bitcoin can flip the 0.5 Fibonacci level as support, the coin may be able to gather some momentum to take another crack at the $9,000 level, which is likely to also be a subconscious psychological level. Bitcoin’s price action has been slow, lacking meaningful volatility for the most part. This may be a fairly neutral condition, unless the price breaks down so much that it causes fear and starts a consistent downward trend.In contrast, a bit of bullish news might be able to snap this market out of its current state and into a short-term uptrend, which could bolster Bitcoin’s longer-term uptrend that started back below $6,000. The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of (@benjaminpirus) and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

As reported by the director of the Department of Economic and Information Security at Ukrzaliznytsia, the farm was organized by officials of the Lviv Railway unit.According to the report, the estimated amount of energy losses caused by the illegal farm has accounted for one million Ukrainian hryvnias ($40,700) in 2019.As the issuance and circulation of crypto in the territory of Ukraine are banned, criminal proceedings have been initiated for the case, Ukrzaliznytsia stated.

Previously, police employees in Ukraine were reportedly caught mining cryptocurrency at work.Meanwhile, the State Service for Special Communication and Information Protection of Ukraine said in 2018 that it was not planning to regulate cryptocurrency mining.The news comes amidst an official announcement that Ukrainian authorities will be consulting with major global crypto exchange Binance to establish crypto-related legislation in the country."

As Bitcoin continues to rise in prominence, efforts have increased to educate consumers about its benefits as hard money — money which no authority or single actor can manipulate. Fiat currency, on the other hand, can be manipulated ad infinitum by central banks through economic policy.

Back when he first encountered the cryptocurrency in 2016, he writes:“Bitcoin had less than $20 billion in total value. I, a relatively small player in the bond market, was turning over $20 billion in Treasuries in just a few months.”Crucial to closing this gap — to bring Bitcoin’s adoption to a level that can rival the Federal Reserve’s processing of $767 trillion via its wire system in one year — Bhatia focuses on the functionality that Lightning Network brings to the cryptocurrency.As previously reported, the Lightning Network is a second-layer solution to Bitcoin’s scalability limitations, opening payment channels between users that keep the majority of transactions off-chain, turning to the underlying blockchain only to record the net results.Recognizing the potential of Bitcoin’s digital scarcity (and its resulting store-of-value properties) when combined with the functionality of Lightning-enabled fast transaction settlement prompted Bhatia to resolutely turn his back on his erstwhile Wall Street career. He writes:“Bitcoin’s supply schedule initially hooked me, but Lightning was the force that was pulling me in [...]  a store-of-value asset exhibiting medium-of-exchange currency speed and scale is unprecedented in human history, and worth pursuit.”Earlier this month, investor Tim Draper singled out innovations such as the Lightning Network and OpenNode would be key in propelling the Bitcoin price higher, reaffirming his belief that BTC/USD would hit $250,000 by 2022 or 2023. He said;“It’s because of Lightning Network and OpenNode and maybe others that are allowing us to spend Bitcoin very freely and quickly, so that it’s not just a store of value but it can be used for micropayments.”"

a new niche for the investment possibilities. 6514 Total views.","Nov 18, 2019","There is a lot of chatter going on about the uncertainties of cryptocurrency and how an attempt to tame the raging seas of the crypto market could spell doom for investors. As expected, in the middle of this conversation is Bitcoin (BTC), whose popularity continues to grow in the investment world. ","Although Bitcoin’s volatility is well-documented, this has not stopped investors from adopting cryptocurrencies as a way of effecting a diversified investment strategy. Interestingly, the volatility narrative is somewhat losing its potency as Bitcoin slowly establishes stability.Hence, I will use this piece to analyze the growing affinity for digital assets and how Bitcoin is fast becoming a viable investment asset class for institutional investors and family offices.The origin of Bitcoin might have caused many to doubt its efficacy. In a world grounded in a centralized culture, it is understandable that people would initially fight off an anomaly that could uproot the foundations of their belief system. At one point, people did not dare to imagine a world without a stratified institution made up of banks and governments that govern the dissemination of money and information. Now that decentralization is finding its way to even the most traditional industries, it is clear that crypto is here to stay.Nonetheless, there remains an ounce of doubt surrounding the viability of Bitcoin as an asset class. Some believe that Bitcoin emerged out of nothing. Therefore, it is impossible that the digital asset would retain its value. However, from my recent analysis of the history of money and the various theorems that established the origin of money, it is evident that Bitcoin fulfills the core requirements that other forms of money have passed.Interestingly, one could argue that the United States dollar, gold and other precious metals have no intrinsic worth — market sentiments brought about their valuation.Institutional investors are aware of the risks that come with allocating a large percentage of their funds to a particular asset or market indices. For one, the downturn of such a market or asset would have a crippling effect on their returns. The same is true for investors that allocate the majority of their portfolio to asset classes that have strong correlations to one another. Hence, adopting a strategy that allows the allocation of funds to different asset classes, with little or no correlation, is the appropriate solution. This is where Bitcoin excels.VanEck published a study that highlighted some of the factors that aided Bitcoin’s ascendancy as a viable investment product. One of these factors is the digital asset’s correlation to major market indices. In the study, VanEck noted that Bitcoin’s apparent disparity from established and emerging markets makes it a suitable portfolio diversification option.This argument holds after considering the correlation of Bitcoin to other markets from January 2012 to July 2019. While other markets had moderate correlations to one or two traditional asset classes, Bitcoin maintained a very weak correlation to all of the asset classes examined. In other words, Bitcoin could fit nicely into an investment portfolio and boost returns.VanEck’s study went further to prove Bitcoin’s eligibility as an investment option. This investigation entailed the assessment of the asymmetric return of portfolios allocated to varying percentages of equities, bonds and Bitcoin from January 2012 to July 2019. A portfolio with 58.5% of the fund distributed to equities, 38.5% to bonds and 0.5% to Bitcoin generated returns that surpassed that of a portfolio allocated solely to the S&P 500 by over 150% as of July 2019.From the basic principle of supply and demand, a commodity tends to retain or increase its value when its supply does not match its demand. In other words, maintaining or increasing the demand for an asset while reducing its supply would eventually cause the price of such an asset to skyrocket. This phenomenon has played out throughout the history of Bitcoin. Bitcoin’s protocol automatically halves its supply roughly every four years. It is also important to note that it is only possible to create new coins, or mine, a maximum of 21 million BTC, and a total of 18 million BTC has already been mined.What all these facts and figures mean is that there is a possibility that the price of Bitcoin will continue to soar. And this might have spurred enthusiasts to predict ridiculous price possibilities. One popular crypto supporter in particular asserted that the next halving, scheduled for May 2020, could cause one Bitcoin to sell for $1 million.Though this prediction sounds over the top, price history shows that the price of Bitcoin has always experienced a surge whenever the reward for finding new blocks undergoes a 50% cut. The last time this happened was in 2016, which led to the unprecedented bull run of 2017. Before this, a Bitcoin was selling for $657. Just over a year later, the price climbed to around $20,000 per coin. Without any doubt, the halving slated for the coming year will affect the price of Bitcoin. Although it is still unclear how much of an impact to expect, I bet that a majority of institutional investors will be closely watching the unfolding drama.Developers are beginning to understand that sustained adoption will never come to fruition until they resolve the issues battling the efficacy of blockchain’s scalability and security. Hence, the development recorded in this space is nothing short of remarkable. For one, the Lightning Network, designed as a sidechain to the Bitcoin’s blockchain, could improve scalability and reduce the cost and time for transacting. This, and more, are some of the reasons why the prospect of Bitcoin’s adoption is looking good.For what it’s worth, the advantages of allocating a fraction of one’s investment portfolio to Bitcoin trump the disadvantages.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.Constantin Kogan is a venture partner at BitBull Capital, a board member of ABOTMI and has been a cryptocurrency investor since 2012.

The best (and worst) quotes, adoption and regulation highlights, leading coins, predictions and much more — a week on Cointelegraph in one link.","BlockShow Asia 2019 was held in Singapore this week, leaving us with plenty of stories to chew over. Binance’s Changpeng Zhao was among the speakers, and he predicted that the central bank digital currency being developed by China will be based on blockchain. Explaining his reasoning, Zhao explained how Beijing wants to push the influence of the renminbi globally in order to make it competitive with the U.S. dollar. He welcomed competition in the crypto world, saying: “Having is better than not having. Having stablecoins is better than not having them. Having Libra is better than not having it.” Zhao’s appearance followed President Xi Jinping’s calls for China to accelerate its adoption of blockchain — and the exchange boss said those who were laughing at blockchain aren’t laughing now.Crypto regulation was another hot button during the two-day event powered by Cointelegraph. Some, such as Proof of Capital’s managing partner Edith Yeung, publicly criticized American regulators for leaving blockchain-based ventures in the dark — with some exchanges leaving the U.S. altogether because of uncertainty surrounding their status. Others, such as Quoine co-founder Mike Kayamori, were far more cautious. He said regulation was something that needs to be done carefully given how the industry is constantly evolving, and he warned: “The government can’t try to regulate things it still doesn’t understand.”Another interesting panel at BlockShow focused on creating token value — and asked whether monetary gains are hindering blockchain innovation. VeChain founder Sunny Lu claimed 99% of a token’s value is normally linked to speculation, rather than the value that a solution can bring to society. He added: “This causes many startups to waste a lot of time producing and 'selling' the token, failing to develop solutions for where they were initially focused.” Fellow speakers acknowledged that it can be difficult to determine the value of blockchain projects, given how the blockchain industry is still very young, but they expressed confidence that it will get easier as the market continues to develop.A quick look at some of this week’s other headlines now. India’s proposed, controversial ban on cryptocurrency is being delayed. The draft bill was expected to be introduced in parliament in the winter session that takes place between Nov. 18 and Dec. 13, but it has not been included in the agenda. Crypto businesses and consumers in the country have expressed concern because the law proposes jail terms of up to 10 years for those found dealing in digital currencies. Indian exchanges have welcomed the delay — urging campaigners to forget competition and ego, and to present their case to regulators in a united fashion. Others have said the delay proves that the government is listening and potentially reevaluating its position.Konstantin Ignatov, the co-founder of the crypto scam OneCoin, has pleaded guilty to participating in the multibillion-dollar fraud. As part of a plea deal, he admitted a multitude of charges, including money laundering and fraud. He is facing up to 90 years in prison and has yet to be sentenced, but will reportedly face no further criminal charges for his role in OneCoin, except potential tax violations. OneCoin is known as a major crypto exit scam, and the Bulgarian-based firm remains fully operational despite allegations it raised $4.4 billion in a Ponzi scheme.At the end of the week, Bitcoin is at $8,602.00, Ether at $185.44, and XRP at $0.27. The total market cap is at $235,793,356,657.The top three altcoin gainers of the week are MMOCoin, eosBLACK and Sparkster. The top three altcoin losers of the week are Monoeci, USDX and Bitcoin God.For more info on crypto prices, make sure to read Cointelegraph’s market analysis. ""Economics and ethics can go together thanks to decentralization.” Ben Goertzel, SingularityNET CEO“In the future, I believe today’s applications will become legacy applications.

[...] The currency itself is not real, with the characteristics that a currency must have.”Jean-Claude Trichet, former European Central Bank presidentThe CEO and co-founder at Distributed Lab, Pavel Kravchenko, has warned that increasing institutional interest in crypto could see Bitcoin’s value crash to zero. Speaking at BlockShow Asia 2019, the industry expert said BTC’s position as censorship-resistant money would be undermined if major players begin to embrace it more fully — undermining its value. During his appearance, Kravchenko also said Bitcoin’s price will rise if governments around the world attempt to ban Bitcoin altogether, and that the cryptocurrency must attempt to become more private and introduce anonymizing features if it is going to remain resistant to censorship.A Dutch court has ruled that Facebook must remove BTC-related fraudulent investment ads following a lawsuit by local billionaire John de Mol. The TV executive had launched legal proceedings against the social network earlier this year, alleging that the company had failed to respond to multiple requests to remove ads that used his image without consent. De Mol claimed that vulnerable victims had lost $1.8 million as a result of the campaign. The court rejected Facebook’s assertion that it is “a neutral funnel for information” — and as well as removing any incriminating ads, the company has been told it must provide all available information about the people behind them. For its part, the tech giant insists it has already taken down the ads in question, and it is considering “all legal options including an appeal.”The U.S. Internal Revenue Service is looking into potential tax issues arising from Bitcoin ATMs and kiosks. John Fort, the regulator’s criminal investigation chief, said the IRS is collaborating with law enforcement to look into the illicit use of such machines. He said: “If you can walk in, put cash in and get Bitcoin out, obviously we’re interested potentially in the person using the kiosk and what the source of the funds is, but also in the operators of the kiosks.” This came as the number of BTC ATMs hit a new milestone worldwide, with more than 6,000 now in operation. More than 65% are based in the United States.David Herr, the chief technical officer of the Dallas Mavericks professional basketball team, has said that only a small number of fans are using crypto to purchase things such as merchandise and tickets. Herr said Bitcoin was “still complicated to 99% of the population” — and he compared the crypto world to a cottage industry. The Mavericks became the second NBA team to accept BTC back in the middle of August.A new white paper is packed with bold predictions about what the future holds for crypto and blockchain — and claims there could even be parallels with the Protestant Reformation that shook Europe in the 16th and 17th centuries. Cointelegraph’s Andrew Singer has more.China’s state-run media recently turned heads by featuring pro-Bitcoin comments, with the flagship digital currency being referred to as the world’s “first successful application of blockchain technology.” Cointelegraph’s Shiraz Jagati explores whether Beijing is attempting to row back its hostility toward crypto and blockchain.Turkey may not be the first country that springs to mind when it comes to above-average crypto adoption, but new research suggests 1 in 5 residents are familiar with it.

fresh testimony to Congress, Jerome Powell appeared to suggest that ...","Nov 14, 2019",The head of the United States Federal Reserve has admitted current economic policy is “not sustainable” — but that it is not its job to fix it.,"Speaking during testimony before Congress’ Joint Economic Committee on Nov. 13, Jerome Powell noted that currently, U.S. national debt is growing faster than nominal GDP.“Ultimately in the long run that’s not a sustainable place to be,” he said. Powell continued:“How to fix that — it’s easy to say that — how do you do that and when do you do that is an issue that is up to you and not to us.”As Cointelegraph reported, U.S. debt has now topped $23 trillion — around $70,000 per head of the population, or more than $1 million for each Bitcoin that will ever exist.On the night of Nov. 14 alone, the Fed distributed funds to banks worth 12.7 million BTC, while its balance sheet is expanding towards $4 trillion.For Powell, however, resolving the debt crisis simply means making growth beat debt, and even failure to do so would not equal chaos.“I would be remiss in not pointing out that the consequences of not addressing it is just that… our kids and grandkids will be spending their tax dollars servicing debt rather than on the things they really need,” he continued. The comments came as U.S. president Donald Trump renewed calls for negative interest rates — effectively charging savers to store fiat currency — and criticized the Fed for not introducing them.“Remember, we are competing with nations who openly cut interest rates so that now many are actually getting paid when they pay off their loan… who ever heard of such a thing? Give me some of that, give me some of that money,” he said in a speech to the Economic Club of New York.Debt-driven economic policy and its consequences were the main motivation behind Bitcoin (BTC), which appeared after the 2008 economic crisis. As hard money with a deflationary supply impossible to manipulate, Bitcoin is increasingly compared to gold as a hedge against the constant erosion in the value of fiat currencies."

bring wealthy Americans to crypto markets. 4755 Total views.","Nov 19, 2019","Michael Novogratz’s crypto merchant bank Galaxy Digital is launching two Bitcoin (BTC) funds, targeting people between the ages of 50 and 80. The new funds aim to bring “the wealth of America,” or people who may have largely remained out of crypto investing, to cryptocurrency markets, Novogratz told Bloomberg Nov. 19.","According to Bloomberg, the funds will offer third-party custody from major crypto consortium Bakkt and Fidelity Digital Assets, the digital asset arm of American investment management company Fidelity Investments.The two new Bitcoin funds — Galaxy Bitcoin Fund and Galaxy Institutional Bitcoin Fund — have reportedly been established with Galaxy’s own money and some participation from existing investors, according to the report.The Galaxy Bitcoin Fund will require a $25,000 minimum investment, and investors will be able to withdraw their funds on a quarterly basis. Meanwhile, Galaxy Institutional Bitcoin Fund has weekly liquidity and a higher initial threshold, the report notes.Both funds will reportedly charge lower fees than major Bitcoin funds such as the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust.Novogratz’s plans will ostensibly bring a significant amount of investment from older demographics as Bitcoin investment is specifically led by the tech-savvy younger generation in the 18–34 age range. Meanwhile, the share of American Bitcoin investors over 50 years old reportedly accounts for 3%.According to a recent study from wealth management firm United Income, Americans under 50 only hold 16% of all investable assets, compared with 31% in 1989. This leaves a massive amount of untapped wealth among older investors that, according to United Income, will comprise $36 trillion in inheritances in the next 30 years.Novogratz, a 54-year-old billionaire and known Bitcoin bull, claimed that there are probably 20 billionaires he could name that made their money outside of crypto and are in crypto now. He added that the new Bitcoin funds could attract investors who are now buying gold.Additionally, Novogratz said he expects that traditional financial services companies will let users invest in Bitcoin in the next 12 months.Earlier today, major Bitcoin fund Grayscale Bitcoin Trust filed Form 10 with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission to become the first crypto fund to report to the regulator. If the filing is approved. Grayscale could see its investor base widen, as more institutional investors will be able to dabble in Bitcoin. "

Bitcoin trading volume reaches an all-time high. 9791 Total views.","Nov 21, 2019","Argentina’s central bank had formally banned consumers from purchasing Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrency using credit cards on Nov. 1. What followed was the very opposite of what the Argentine government had anticipated — over the past two weeks, the country has traded the highest amount of Bitcoins on the peer-to-peer platform LocalBitcoins, according to data by CoinDance.","One of the biggest factors in the high adoption of crypto in the country is the high volatility of the Argentine peso. In just the past five years, the value of the peso against the United States dollar has fallen by over 85%. The residents of the country have traditionally had little confidence in their currency, favoring to convert their spare pesos into relatively stable dollars.The country’s sovereign currency is the peso, which people earn and spend, but it’s the U.S. dollar that defines the value of goods and services. The peso–dollar exchange rate is quoted daily by the media, alongside weather and traffic reports.Looking at the economic situation of Argentina, crypto bull Tim Draper advised the president of Argentina in March 2019 to legalize Bitcoin in order to improve the country’s economic situation. He counseled the president on crypto’s potential to improve the devaluation of the Argentine peso and relieve the associated brain drain. Daniel Popa, CEO of the Anchor stablecoin, told Cointelegraph that despite the volatility of crypto, Argentinians trust it more as a store of value than the peso because Bitcoin cannot be manipulated by the government, adding that:“Unfortunately, bitcoin does not offer predictability, underlining the ongoing need for a universally-accepted stablecoin and financial standard that could be adopted by anyone in the world, including those suffering from the negative economic impacts that stem from war, natural disasters, health crises, and disruptive monetary policies.”To give some historical context, in the 1990s, the peso was pegged to the dollar by the government of President Carlos Menem in an attempt to stifle inflation. The dollar peg damaged exports, pushing the state to take on more debt to remain afloat amid a worsening economic crisis. The peg was lifted in 2002. However, the dollar had already been ingrained in Argentine culture.On Sept. 1, the Central Bank of Argentina had imposed restrictions on U.S. dollar purchases to revive the plunging peso. Citizens’ purchases made in dollars were limited to $10,000 a month, requiring special permissions beyond that limit. The bank also said it would restrict dollar purchases to $200 per month via bank account and just $100 per month in cash, until December.Talking to Cointelegraph about the government’s crackdown on forex, Salomon Ptit Haddad, the head of institutional sales at Enigma Securities, said, “Given the current degree of uncertainty, the BCRA board of directors decided to take a series of measures that seek to preserve the reserves of the Central Bank.” Haddad went on to add:“The Argentine Central Bank can easily impose restrictive measures on the use of bank cards, with local banks having to comply with the guidelines imposed by the country’s central bank. Argentina, which has a $50 billion debt to the IMF and is trying to get out of the economic problems it is facing.”Keeping up with the trend to increase the adoption of peso, the Central Bank of Argentina announced on Oct. 31 that citizens are prohibited from using credit cards to buy cryptocurrencies. Haddad believes that this regulatory policy is aimed at protecting the national currency at the cost of crypto, since Argentine citizens tend to exchange crypto back into the dollar either offshore or in the country. He also added that since November this year, the BCA has mandated all card issuers to be registered prior to distributing new cards, “This has generated great uncertainty within the South American country, where it is customary to have cash and dispense with banking systems.” Haddad went on to add:“Now, after this measure, the cryptocurrencies can be a way to preserve assets for those who want to save, bearing in mind that the origin of people looking for a stronger asset is the devaluation of the local currency, which has been devalued by 50% so far this year.”We have seen it time and again in countries like India and China, where crypto trading volumes surge upward following a ban. Talking about how this move led to an increased interest in crypto, the co-founder and chief operations officer at ShapeShift exchange, who simply goes by “Jon,” said:“Capital controls seem to have a direct correlation with getting people more interested in Bitcoin because it’s something the government can’t control. The population of the country sees these capital controls are put in place and then they’re going to look for a way around it. That’s where Bitcoin and crypto come in, as they give a good way to store and transfer values when they’re dealing with this type of uncertainty.”Argentina’s deputy minister of finance, Felix Martin Soto, claimed in March this year that the government should approach crypto and blockchain tech as a way to improve Argentina’s financial inclusion and reduce state costs.He had also asserted that promoting the crypto industry in the nation will serve to reduce its demand for dollars, which will ultimately commit to preserving the local market and attracting global investment. Soto is not the only one who is pro-crypto. Upon being elected in 2015, President Mauricio Macri was perceived to be good news for the legal status of Bitcoin in the country. He was the one to sponsor the First Bitcoin Forum in Buenos Aires in July 2015. Although, his enthusiasm for cryptos didn’t seem to last for too long. Jon gave two reasons as to why the president slowed his fondness toward crypto:“1) It’s hard to focus on Bitcoin regulation while trying to keep the government stable and national currency inflation down so people can afford to live; and 2) he’s probably running into bureaucratic pushback for various reasons.”Apart from the forum, there have been other initiatives by organizations to spread crypto awareness. For example, nonprofit organizations Bitcoin Argentina and Bitcoin Americana launched an informational campaign called “Bitcoineta.” It consisted of a Bitcoin-branded van, jointly purchased by the two organizations, that went around Argentina to spread basic knowledge about cryptocurrencies among local communities.2018’s edition of G-20, which was coincidently held in Argentina, mentioned crypto regulation. The officials stated their concerns regarding the crypto industry as well as their overall agenda for both the future and infrastructure development of the participating nations.The conclusion of the summit saw a declaration titled, “Building Consensus for Fair and Sustainable Development,” which regards cryptocurrencies as an important part of an “open and resilient financial system” that “is crucial to support sustainable growth.” The document also highlights the necessities of Anti-Money Laundering and anti-terrorist measures as per the standards of the Financial Action Task Force, providing clear instructions to participating nations on crypto regulation.Related: FATF AML Regulation: Can the Crypto Industry Adapt to the Travel Rule?However, Argentina itself didn’t make much of an effort to regulate digital assets. The Argentine government has not implemented specific regulations on exchange, issuance or — in general — the use of digital assets. Regarding the Argentine government’s failure to take swift action on the regulatory front, Shapeshift’s Jon said:“It’s hard to fully know why that didn’t happen, but my best guess is that the crypto regulation discussion got caught up in bureaucratic priorities. Unless the government, any government, really makes something a priority, other things just take precedence. I doubt there’s specific intent around not regulating crypto, rather it’s something they’ve just not gotten to yet.”Argentina is the textbook example of how Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies can find a use as a store of value, especially in economically vulnerable nations. If the government is serious about reducing their dependence on the U.S. dollar, it is becoming more apparent that they should embrace and understand crypto. Early adoption of digital currencies could help the country come out of its financial downturn."
33,https://cointelegraph.com,"Nov 17, 2019","Bitcoin Revolution Meets Protestant Reformation, Crypto Drives Change?",https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-revolution-meets-protestant-reformation-crypto-drives-change,"“The Bitcoin Reformation” points to four fundamental parallels between the 
Protestant Reformation and the present day — do they have merit?","Nov 17, 2019","A bit of historical research was making the rounds on social media recently, a monograph that compares the 21st century emergence of Bitcoin, encryption, the internet and millennials with the Protestant Reformation that shook Europe in the 16th and 17th centuries. ","The two events have similar dynamics, argues Tuur Demeester, whose white paper, “The Bitcoin Reformation,” is packed with bold predictions about the crypto and blockchain future, such as, “Bitcoin savers could accelerate a revolution in the history of thought.”The report had 7,000 visits and was downloaded 2,800 times in the first 24 hours of its publishing, announced the author on Twitter on Nov. 8, adding, “translations in French and Finnish on the way.” Demeester, a founding partner of Adamant Capital LP, also said:“The main thesis of ‘The Bitcoin Reformation’ is that there are four fundamental parallels between the Protestant Reformation and the present day, which could signal profound societal and economic changes ahead.”It is worth enumerating these four conditions that “enabled” the reformation and may be present again today:In 16th century Europe, the Catholic Church was a monopolistic provider of spiritual services. The Church also commanded the legal system, “and controlled the keys to heaven via forgiveness of sin.” Demeester compares the Church with the International Monetary and Financial System, which traces its origins back to the 1944 Bretton Woods agreement that replaced the gold standard with the United States dollar as the global currency. Central banks today, most prominently the U.S. Federal Reserve, control key parts of the legal system as well as “the keys to the wealth and pensions of the world’s citizenry,” argues Demeester. Sixteenth century Europe gave birth to a number of transformative technological inventions: The printing press, for instance, lowered the cost of a book from a year’s labor to the price of a chicken, notes Demeester, while other innovations like double-entry bookkeeping, the compass and the hourglass accelerated international commerce and exploration.The parallel is today’s digital revolution, including email, open-source software, cryptography, social media and the commoditization of computation and data storage.“Both times involved a new economic class with something to fight for,” writes the author. In the 16th and 17th centuries, it was a new merchant class trying to break the economic stranglehold of feudal landlords and the church. Today, it is a younger generation, the so-called millennials, who exhibit: “Distinct skepticism towards traditional finance, and enthusiastically embraces digital innovation. A 2016 survey by Facebook found that only 8% of millennials ‘trust financial institutions for guidance,’ and that 45% are ‘ready to switch if a better option comes along.’”A citizenry will be reluctant to challenge a domineering authority if they don’t have a means for defense and escape, argues Demeester, and during their revolt against their authoritarian, Catholic Spanish overlords at Alkmaar in 1573, the (Protestant) Dutch breached their dikes and flooded the countryside to raise the siege. They used this tactic repeatedly during their 80-year revolt. In the 21st century:“The defensive technological suite available for people who question the economic status quo is cryptography — which can enable privacy and protection from asset seizure.”Demeeter’s monopolist comparison between the Catholic Church of 16th century Europe and the likes of the International Monetary Fund of today resonated with Richard Sylla, Professor Emeritus of Economics at NYU. “We all know that banks charge you a lot for transferring money,” told Sylla to Cointelegraph. Bitcoin and other cryptos hold the promise of making overseas payments less expensive and more secure. Breaking the banks’ so-called monopoly here would have benefits. But the Federal Reserve and its peer central banks aren’t likely to vanish anytime soon, Sylla said: “It’s more likely the ‘monopolists’ will participate, with central banks establishing their own digital currency, either separately or collaboration with other countries. Most countries are still jealous of their sovereignty, including the right to print money, and central banks are carefully studying cryptocurrencies — not just Bitcoin, whose price volatility makes it suspect as a currency.”Not all agree that the Protestant Reformation is the proper historical comparison for today’s financial services upheaval, or “the most fundamental transformation in history,” as Nigel Green, founder and CEO of deVere Group, told Cointelegraph:“I believe these contemporary changes are similar to other financial sector milestones, such as the Rothschild family establishing their banks in the late 18th century, the deregulation of the [financial services] sector in the 1980s, and the 2008 global financial crash. And it is fintech, in all its many forms including cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, that is fueling this.”Demeester is associated with the Austrian School of Economics, which some dismiss as “simply a religion serving to justify libertarian policy conclusions.” One social media response to the The Bitcoin Reformation suggested:“If #crypto spent as much time turning decentralized immutable databases into useful products or services that we all want/need as they do trying to convert people to a religion of ‘sound money’ that’s anything but, and wishing for the world to end so $BTC can be more valuable, that would be nice.”Still, Demeester’s 23-part Twitter summary of The Bitcoin Reformation prompted 435 retweets and over 1000 likes. Demeester ranks 5th on Hive’s list of top crypto “influencers,” and his tweetstorm may have fallen upon mostly sympathetic ears. Although, in response to the author’s statement that “we see broad parts of society, millennials especially, acting increasingly critical of central bank interventionism,” one dissenter replied, “I wish this were true, but don't see any evidence of it. I would guess 99% of millennials don't even know what a central bank is.” Another commented: “I’m struggling to see how you put millennials and Bitcoin into the same basket. Millennials tend to care the most of any generation about the environment. Bitcoin doesn't align with this.”Coinmetrics.io co-founder and Castle Island Ventures partner Nic Carter applauded Demeester for “recognizing the higher role of private, non-state money — as a significant social and political phenomenon,” he told Cointelegraph. The comparison with the Protestant revolution was useful in raising the Bitcoin conversation to its proper level, according to him. Carter went on to add that he found the white paper “quite compelling, refreshing”:“Too often detractors dismiss it as a minor technological innovation, like an advance in database software, or just a more efficient way to do payment processing — as opposed to an institutional revolution.”There are no shortage of provocative comparisons of past and present in “The Bitcoin Reformation.” Demeester describes how the Dutch Republic accessed capital through proto-annuities, and compares with today’s initial exchange offering tokens, which also tap the market for liquidity. Each era has had its memes and slogans that drive the idea of cutting out the middleman. The Reformation’s “Sola Fide” (faith alone is enough, no need for a priest) is paralleled by the Bitcoin era’s “Vires in Numeris” (strength in numbers) and Tyler Winklevoss’ quote, “We have elected to put our money and faith in a mathematical framework that is free of politics and human error.” The author offers seven “suggested” conclusions — predictions, really — ranging from the momentous “Bitcoin tolerance versus intolerance to become a major political faultline” to the circumscribed “Initial exchange offerings (IEOs) expected to stay and grow larger.” Unfortunately, these predictions aren’t really elaborated upon or supported in the report’s text. They rather seem to be food for future thought.The Protestant Reformation was a religious revolution. It essentially drove the Catholic Church out of most of Northern Europe. Bitcoin and its underlying blockchain technology may not rise to this level of social and economic upheaval. Yes, the new technologies may supplant the “banking monopoly” in some areas where it is arguably overcharging for its services, such as cross-border payments, but these are essentially tweaks, incremental improvements to the financial system. By comparison, Bitcoin won’t stop the Federal Reserve from printing more U.S. dollars — not anytime soon, anyway. The more likely scenario, as Sylla suggests, is the Fed co-opts digital currency, as Facebook is trying to do with Libra. This possibility isn’t considered in the report.Overall, though, as much as one might delight in historical analogies, the real problem, as the author of The Bitcoin Reformation himself acknowledges, is that secular trends are often only visible in hindsight."

At Room 77  I met a guy who was super nice & explained to me all the basics about Bitcoin & got me interested in getting BTC myself instead of using BitPay & receiving euros. The next day I found out he was Andreas Antonopoulos.”The thread continues to outline that paving the way toward crypto entrepreneurship began with getting a Trezor hardware wallet for cold storage and starting to directly accept Bitcoin via the open-source payment processor BTCPay Server. Weeks later, the shop began accepting payments via the second-layer scalability solution Lightning Network, later taking its ice cream and hot chocolate to Berlin’s Lightning Conference. The thread continues:“I’m convinced that little shops like ours are a very important factor to bitcoin growth.When non bitcoiners see more businesses accepting bitcoin, they will start to stop fearing it and would get more curious about it and would like to be a part of it.”The since-exposed Antonopoulos responded positively on Twitter, writing:“You took the effort to fully understand cryptocurrency and the implications of how you could better run your business with it.

I am still long on Bitcoin (BTC) from under $9,000, as price moves sideways.","Part 1: Setting up the tradeEntries: .00000800 satoshis (sats), .00000870(sats), .00000797 (sats)Targets: 0.00000940 (sats), .00001044 (sats)Stop loss: The first stop loss was set at .00000781 (sats) on the breakout. As usual, I move this up to follow the price when required.Risk / reward: Target 1 = 7.37, Target 2 = 12.84A member of the TexasWest Capital Discord asked me to chart XLM a few days before, and I identified the .00000797 (sats) area as a place that I would consider buying. In a surprise announcement, the Stellar Lumens team decided to burn 50% of the coin supply, causing a large and fast upside move, which caused my alarms at .00000797 (sats) to go off. My preferred strategy is to buy the retest of a key resistance as support rather than just buying the breakout. As can be seen in the second chart below, XLM price came back and tested support, which is where I entered.I set my buy orders at .00000800 (sats) instead of .00000797 (sats), just in case that line was front-run. This is a 15-minute chart, a time frame I rarely utilize. However, in a move this large and fast based on news, the price was unlikely to retest over a longer period of time, so I was willing to trade this smaller time frame.I rarely FOMO into positions, but I saw the 50% burn as a legitimate catalyst and expected the price to potentially pull off an absolutely massive pump.

In an effort to catch a second pump, I reentered at .00000870 (sats) but ultimately stopped out of this trade with the entire position at that same line when the price dropped.I made 17.5% on half of this position in less than an hour, a very successful trade in my mind.

With the growth of digital asset derivatives, participants of all kinds will need new and efficient ways to hedge their positions.”As Cointelegraph has reported, Tassat recently succeeded in overcoming the first hurdle in its bid to launch its own fully-regulated crypto derivatives exchange. The United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) approved the transfer of existing registration rights from affiliated financial services firm that pave the way to allowing Tassat to operate an exchange listing futures or options contracts with the agency’s oversight.In March, Tassat — when it was still known as trueDigital — partnered with crypto data firm Kaiko and digital assets analytics company Inca Digital Securities to widen the distribution of its over-the-counter reference rates for Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH), the latter of which it created in partnership with ConsenSys."

We’ll develop a new smart contract to handle ERC20s, and, in the more distant future, ERC721s.”The move comes roughly a week after LocalBitcoins announced its registration with regulators in its home country of Finland. Part of a multi-year scheme to formalize its compliance, LocalBitcoins is now an official virtual currency provider in the eyes of the Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority or FIN-FSA.As Cointelegraph reported, the platform’s metamorphosis has alienated many users, who found they were no longer able to transact anonymously. Executives had incrementally phased out ways of trading on LocalBitcoins without revealing one’s identity, with cash trades now banned and ID submission obligatory. By contrast, LocalCryptos stays away from such requirements, operating as a non-custodial resource under which no financial liability is taken on.The setup allows the platform to retain features that LocalBitcoins has shunned. When cash trades disappeared, LocalCryptos turned the decision into a PR opportunity on social media. Other operators in the space, such as Bisq, also saw a surge in popularity during the change, which occurred in June this year."

However, there will be some changes to Grayscale’s scope and operations.Should the SEC accept Grayscale’s filing, it would designate the fund as an SEC reporting company and obligate it to register its shares under the Exchange Act. Furthermore, as many institutions block investors from considering trusts based on SEC-approval, Grayscale’s eligible investor audience could widen. The SEC’s auditing standards would also be applied to Grayscale.The firm also noted that accredited investors will benefit if the filing is approved:“Accredited investors who have previously purchased shares in the Trust’s private placement would have an earlier liquidity opportunity, as the statutory holding period of their private placement shares would be reduced from 12 to 6 months.”Grayscale is not the only fund seeking to give investors easy exposure to Bitcoin. As Cointelegraph reported in September, investment management firm VanEck also launched its own Bitcoin trust, and issued just four Bitcoins during the first week of operation.Grayscale’s regulatory foray follows a record year for the trust, which saw inflows of $254 million in total investment into its products in the third quarter of 2019. Q3 2019 marked the highest demand for the company’s offerings since its establishment, making a threefold quarter-on-quarter increase from $84.8 million in Q2 2019."

Coincidentally, regulators start looking to apply more scrutiny.","Nov 21, 2019","Earlier this week, the number of Bitcoin (BTC) ATMs installed worldwide reached a new milestone, surpassing 6,000. Coincidentally, another major development just a day before occurred within the same area: The United States Internal Revenue Service said it was looking into potential tax issues caused by such ATMs and kiosks.","This development might allow the IRS to succeed in mitigating the use cryptocurrency for large-scale federal tax non-compliance, experts suggest. However, Bitcoin ATMs remain a low-transaction-size business which is already regulated enough to detect high-scale fraud. The world’s first-ever Bitcoin ATM opened in October 2013 at Waves Coffee House in Vancouver’s downtown area, while the first machine in the United States went online in February 2014 in Albuquerque, New Mexico (although, it was removed 30 days later). Since then, Bitcoin ATMs have grown into a multi-million-dollar industry, as the companies who operate the machines collect sizeable fees (reportedly around 8.93%). For instance, Cottonwood, a firm that controlled 91 machines in New York as of December 2018, had a gross annual revenue ostensibly exceeding $35 million —  about $385,000 in cash per machine — and just 13 employees, as per a Bloomberg investigation.According to data from online resource CoinATMRadar, the U.S. currently has the most Bitcoin ATMs in the world. More specifically, there are 3924 machines installed across the country, accounting for over 65% of the world’s total Bitcoin ATMs. Moreover, the industry continues to develop at a rapid pace: Over 130 machines have been deployed this month alone, while the average daily number of Bitcoin ATMs installed is fluctuating at around seven.As it tends to happen within most booming industries, sooner or later, regulators start to apply more scrutiny. On Nov. 15, the IRS Criminal Investigation Chief, John Fort, said that his agency is collaborating with law enforcement to investigate illicit uses of cryptocurrency through kiosks, stating:“If you can walk in, put cash in and get bitcoin out, obviously we’re interested potentially in the person using the kiosk and what the source of the funds is, but also in the operators of the kiosks.”Fort explained that such services are required to conform to Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering rules: “They’re required to abide by the same know-your-customer, anti-money laundering regulations, and we believe some have varying levels of adherence to those regulations.” The IRS executive added that although the regulators haven’t had any public cases filed, they “do have open cases in inventory” related to cryptocurrency tax issues.So how exactly is the industry regulated in the U.S.? It seems to fall into a grey area of the law. Cal Evans, founder of compliance and strategy firm Gresham International, told Cointelegraph:“Most Bitcoin ATM owners that are trying to follow the rules, as much as possible, are relying on Money Transmitter laws. We see this strategy deployed with the bigger firms such as Coinbase. These laws differ from state to state with the USA, with the most notable exception being the state of New York where parties are required to own one of the notorious ‘Bitcoin’ Licenses to conduct this business.” Thus, there are two levels of regulation: federal and state. As CEO of CoinATMRadar Matthew Hayes told Cointelegraph, the former is “similar in all the states and quite straightforward,” and aims to prevent illicit activities such as money laundering and tax evasion. State-level regulation, however, differs: “Some states have relaxed rules and allow quite easy access to start such a business. In other states, there might be high requirements to operate incl. large size surety bonds and costly licenses.”Thus, unlike traditional ATM operators, Bitcoin ATM operators are typically treated as Money Services Businesses that have to operate under Money Transmitter Licenses, the requirements for which vary by state, as Zachary Kelman, managing partner at Kelman.law, summed up in a conversation with Cointelegraph. However, there are some exceptions among more crypto-friendly states that differ from New York and Florida regulations:“On the other end of the spectrum are states that are far more Bitcoin ATM-friendly — for example, the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities has determined that cryptocurrency transactions are exempt from money transmitter rules, and the Wyoming legislature enacted a law exempting cryptocurrency businesses from MSB licensing requirements.”Andrew Barnard, co-founder of Bitcoin ATM firm Bitstop, added that many states, including California, have still not made up their minds in regard to Bitcoin ATMs or do not require a Money Transmitter License as long as the crypto sold through the ATMs is a two-party transaction. He elaborated to Cointelegraph: “States like Texas and others do not require a money transmitter license if you are selling your own Bitcoin to the person in front of the machine as opposed to just sending the Bitcoin directly from an exchange to the customer which would make it a three party transaction.”Some other hindrances come with the lack of more clear-cut regulations, albeit less major. For instance, companies have difficulties with obtaining local city permits for Bitcoin ATMs, which is why they are usually installed in private establishments, Evans observed.Indeed, as the Bloomberg investigation argued, most crypto kiosks in the U.S. tend to be located in corner shops, cigar bars and casinos. Nevertheless, there are some noticeable exceptions: Earlier this month, Bitstop installed one of its machines at the Miami International Airport, one of the largest airline hubs in the country.Related: US Crypto Review: Top-5 States With Welcoming RegulationsAs for the regulations, it seems that industry players do have concrete guidance to follow despite the juridical uncertainty that experts highlight. “FinCEN has been clear since 2013 about the KYC/BSA/AML requirements for cryptocurrency exchangers,” said Max Lopez, marketing director at Coin Cloud — a company that operates as a licensed Money Service Business and hosts over 350 cryptocurrency kiosks across the U.S. “We only know the regulations we are following and can not speak for others in the cryptocurrency kiosk industry,” Lopez added, drawing a line between large businesses and smaller players. “It’s important to separate individual companies and not place them all under one umbrella as you have regional, hobbyist and ‘mom and pop’ operators with one machine.”Barnard of Bitstop confirms that larger companies follow the same rules within the Bitcoin ATM industry. “The top legitimate operators in the space are registered with FinCEN on a federal level and maintain a AML/BSA compliance program which should be tested and updated regularly (once a year),” he told Cointelegraph, adding:“It’s not that difficult to be registered on a federal level.”The IRS should have a “probable cause” or “reasonable belief” to delve into the Bitcoin ATM industry, according to Evans. As of now, “simply using the Bitcoin ATMs itself is in no way a crime,” the expert stressed, especially if the vendor is following MTLs and users are declaring their transactions to the IRS:“Let’s paint a scenario, if you are a Bitcoin ATM user in the US (which is totally legal), and you declare those transactions on your tax return (as now required), the IRS could be in breach of constitutional rights by investigating the individual. Essentially, the IRS should not be able to tax activity it then deems as ‘illegal’ activity after the fact. Otherwise, where do we draw the line? Do we begin taxing drug dealers?”Nevertheless, the IRS has been historically slow to act, which also suggests that the industry is far from being radically changed by the tax regulator, Evans adds. Kelman, however, envisions certain changes that might come with the IRS statement. He told Cointelegraph that some of their Bitcoin ATM operator clients had already engaged with the IRS:  “The IRS has been amenable to these clients and their businesses, asking for and accepting without issue the Bitcoin ATM users’ Know Your Customer (KYC) information, which is collected to the extent possible by Bitcoin ATM operators per compliance with MSB rules.”Kelman explained that while his firm does not expect Bitcoin kiosk owners to close down in light of this development, they do expect changes to which the kiosk operators must respond, such as collecting KYC data from any user whose transactions require Currency Transaction Reports or Suspicious Activity Reports filings:“The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) already requires MSBs to file Currency Transaction Reports (CTRs) on all transactions in excess of $10,000 and Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) for any and all suspicious transactions — or sequences of transactions — over $2,000.”Kelman believes that the statement from the IRS will prompt users to conduct smaller transactions beneath the KYC limit. In his opinion, the IRS “will be able to greatly mitigate efforts to use cryptocurrency for large-scale federal tax non-compliance,” while small-scale tax cheats will likely stay under the radar. Indeed, larger operators seem unfazed by the news. Both Coin Cloud and Bitstop representatives told Cointelegraph that business remains as usual for smaller Bitcoin ATM owners while they aren’t being forced to either become fully compliant or shut down.Even if smaller players choose to play by the rules, they might still have to shut shop over time due to the costs associated with maintaining a thorough compliance program, Bitstop’s Barnard added. He also told Cointelegraph:“Mr Fort is reasonable when he says there is most likely a high variance of compliance and adherence to regulations from operator to operator. This is true because there are different Bitcoin ATM hardware models that have different software stacks and perform compliance differently. Not all operators are created equal. There’s a lot of good guys, but our industry does have its own share of bad apples.”As Evans of Gresham International told Cointelegraph, physical ATM machines harness a large amount of data about their users, such as card used, PIN number attempts, speed of PIN entry, date, time, transaction sizes, and pictures of their face. “The main concern the IRS has with the Bitcoin ATMs, is that some of these machines do not collect ANY data,” he said: “If we compare this, for example, to online exchanges (those which allow US citizens and residents to use them), they are required to keep accurate data on the users, which the IRS and other law enforcement bodies can then use to track the movement of funds.”Nevertheless, Bitcoin ATMs controlled by large operators claim that they collect a considerable amount of data about their clients as per current regulations concerning Anti-Money Laundering and the Bank Secrecy Act. “As a registered MSB with FinCEN, Coin Cloud is required to keep customer KYC and transactional data for at least 5 years,” Lopez told Cointelegraph. “All cryptocurrency kiosk companies can be subpoenaed at any time for the records they keep.”Barnard said that although KYC collection can vary depending on how much the customer wants to buy or sell. “For lower amounts under $150, a phone number, name and address may be reasonable,” the Bitstop representative told Cointelegraph, adding that they limit all of their customers to purchase no more than $3,000 per person per day. “Even then, less than 5% of our customer base will use that limit,” he continued. “The average purchase from our Bitstop Bitcoin ATMs is $180 per person. Bitcoin ATMs are a high-volume, low transaction amount business.”"

The police were also able to catch their license plate too.""While the local media report gives little context on the small-town grocery store’s decision to install a Bitcoin ATM — Vernon has a population of just over 40,000 — the shaken owner said he now plans to remove the machine. The adverse impact of the small-time heist is all the more ironic given the thieves’ own hamfisted success, with local reporters revealing that: “The thieves made off with $4,000, but left $50,000 still in the machine in a canister they didn’t check.”In fall 2018, Cointelegraph reported on the Indian authorities’ controversial arrest of the developers of the country’s first Bitcoin ATM. The story carried particular symbolic clout in light of the two suspects being the co-founders of the country’s first cryptocurrency exchange, Unocoin, celebrated by the local industry as being among India’s brightest tech pioneers. The arrests were vehemently opposed amid a fog of regulatory uncertainty and the case’s intersection with the government’s evolving stance toward the sector at the time.Earlier this week, the number of Bitcoin ATMs installed worldwide reached a new milestone, surpassing 6,000. In a development apparently not directly triggered by the news directly, the United States Internal Revenue Service has this week revealed it is looking into potential tax issues caused by cryptocurrency ATMs and kiosks."

And they do a great job of it by making ordinary people get poorer. We are ready to fight for change and protect people.""The Unknown Fund argues that the deployment of blockchain technology and digital currencies could help protect people’s rights and freedoms, and eventually develop a new environment with a trustworthy monetary system.Many industry players have questioned blockchain’s ability to ensure personal data protection. Speaking with Cointelegraph in August, Timothy Paolini, a board member at NYU Blockchain, stated:“Blockchains are built around the principles of decentralization, removing the single point of failure risk (think Equifax servers) and cutting out unnecessary third parties by establishing a more direct, peer-to-peer network. This also maintains your privacy and control of your data from third-party apps as data rests at the protocol instead of the application layer.”Deirdre K. Mulligan, an assistant professor at the University of California, Berkeley School of Information, argued that blockchains do not inherently protect your identity, as they can be manipulated by their architects to be centralized and non-anonymous. Mulligan stated:“Companies can exert a lot of control over how they design an application, through its architecture, default settings, what it communicates in its privacy policies, and what it does in practice. The value for a consumer concerned about her privacy would depend on the blockchain application and the kind of data collected and processed by it.”"

If we spot activity differing from the stated purpose of the account, or missing information, we will proactively review all activity, which can also result in account closure.”London-headquartered HSBC has upheld its strong presence in the city due to alleged pressure to “maintain its standing with residents there,” Bloomberg writes.The company derived over 35% of its adjusted revenue from Hong Kong in the first nine months of 2019 and reportedly stated this October that its business in the city remained robust, notwithstanding the political turbulence.As reported in October — days after redoubled protests by Hong Kong residents in the wake of the 70th anniversary of the People’s Republic of China — Morgan Creek Digital co-founder Anthony Pompliano noted that the “non-seizability” of Bitcoin becomes ever more attractive in moments of geopolitical crisis: faced with a crackdown on civil liberties via emergency powers, anxious residents reportedly flocked to the city’s ATMs. Intermediary cryptocurrency payments processors have also sparked ire for their apparent susceptibility to political pressures, as the recent controversy over BitPay demonstrated, following claims it blocked donations to the Hong Kong Free Press for several weeks.Yesterday, the former chief financial officer of PayPal revealed that Bank of America (BoA) had chosen to close his account, without a stated reason. "

In reality, however, it is almost mathematically impossible that the same miner would unlock the block reward for so many blocks in a row.Nodes can be left behind during hard forks for various reasons, often due to accidentally forgetting to upgrade before the block set to trigger the hard fork. The inefficiency nonetheless piled publicity on Bitcoin Cash and major proponent Roger Ver. Ver, in particular, has become a highly controversial figure in cryptocurrency due to his arguably unsuccessful campaign to plant BCH as a superior alternative to BTC. Pro-Bitcoin figures took Ver’s allies to task on social media. These included Olivier Janssens, who previously argued that a node “doesn’t matter” in a decentralized peer-to-peer network and that removing Bitcoin’s block size cap was, therefore, essential to avoid hostile takeovers.The hard fork meanwhile failed to lift the poor performance of BCH/USD, which has shed around 3.2% in the 24 hours since the hard fork. At $267, the altcoin remains 93% down versus its all-time high of $3,920 achieved in December 2017."

Source: TradingViewThe Bollinger Bands and underlying support at $177.57 and $176.79 suggest that Ether has temporarily bottomed and the price is likely to make an attempt to return to the middle Bollinger Band moving average, which is directly aligned with the ascending trendline at $185.28ETH USD 6-hour chart. Source: TradingViewBased on Ether’s price action since Oct. 27, the current bounce off support appears to be a good entry point for 3.5% to 3.94% gain. Risk-averse traders will probably wait for the price to break above the ascending trendline at $185.28 before considering an entry.Aggressive traders may have concluded that if Ether price returns to its most recent range an entry at $179.50 represents a 7.08% profit opportunity. The moving average confluence divergence (MACD) on the 6-hour timeframe shows the MACD line beginning to curve up toward the signal line and the histogram bars have shortened and flipped from red to pink as buying volume increases. As mentioned earlier, a move to $185.28 would place Ether back above the 50-DMA and the ascending trendline. The volume profile visible range shows a lot of selling pressure at $180 to $186.93. But if the price can clear this node, Ether could run to the upper Bollinger Band arm at $191.33 followed by the 200-DMA at $197.25. Reclaiming the 200-DMA restores the previously discussed profit-taking estimates starting at $204. ETH BTC daily chart.

Source: TradingViewETH BTC daily chart. Source: TradingViewDespite Friday’s pullback, Ether price remains in an ascending channel with the 12 exponential moving average (EMA) above the 26-EMA. Breaking above the descending trendline would be notable as Ether price has been trapped below the trendline for 22-months. Although, traders will certainly remember Ether’s December 2018 rally from $80 to $364 on the ETH/USD pair. Traders will be closely watching to see if Ether can cross above the descending trendline. This would be significant as Ether leads altcoins by market capitalization and at the moment handfuls of altcoins are showing identical chart setups or have already crossed above the 200-DMA and the descending trendline. Over the weekend and the coming week, traders will be looking for Ether price to continue climbing in the ascending channel. A move above 0.021581 (sats) would clear the high volume node shown on the volume profile visible range (VPVR) and bring Ether price right to the long-term resistance at 0.021999 (sats).This point has served as resistance since July 14, 2019, and moving above it would position Ether to set a monthly higher high at 0.023063 (sats). More importantly, the VPVR shows that there is minimal selling pressure above this level and Ether would be en-route to take out the 200-DMA. Assuming Ether is able to remain in the ascending channel and overcome the resistance levels mentioned above, the altcoin could be potentially gain 18.15% before encountering resistance at 0.025346 (sats). The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author (@HorusHughes) and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

The claim — which pertained to an ICO investment for which DigitalX served as an advisor — was filed by a group of clients in Australia’s Federal Court, for a combined total of around $1.8 million, plus damages. At the time, DigitalX said it denied all claims of wrongdoing and said it would vigorously defend its reputation.In May 2019, DigitalX entered into a settlement deed with the applicant, without any admission of liability, paying out a total of ~$275,000 in cash and $240,000 in company shares. It pledged to pursue contractual indemnities with third parties for partial recovery of the settlement funds."

The reason was not stated in the bank’s correspondence.Uploading an edited screenshot of a letter he had received about the closure, Botha summarized:“After being a customer of @BankofAmerica for 20 years, I received this notice today that they decided to fire me as their customer! With absolutely no explanation.”The event adds an irony which did not go unnoticed among cryptocurrency Twitter commentators. As Cointelegraph reported, PayPal is also known for its seemingly arbitrary account closures and freezing user funds.Last week, the company stopped servicing adult entertainment website Pornhub, resulting in the service’s 100,000 models being unable to receive their earnings.Then, as now, attention is focused on the ability of trusted centralized entities to control others’ money. With Bitcoin, it is impossible for a third party to cut off access, unless a user chooses to use a wallet to which they do not control the private keys.A dedicated effort, Proof of Keys, continues to urge even existing Bitcoin holders not to store coins on exchanges or use third-party hosting.“Did you buy any Bitcoin?” entrepreneur and Civic CEO Vinny Lingham responded to Botha. Other well-known names from the industry followed, with venture capitalist Adam Draper likewise telling him to buy the cryptocurrency.“It's like they're trying to promote Bitcoin,” popular Twitter trader Rhythm added.BoA itself already had a poor reputation regarding cryptocurrency tolerance. Previously, the lender banned clients from using its cards to buy Bitcoin, while more recently showing an affinity for Ripple’s blockchain offerings."

is reviewing its decision to reject Bitwise's Bitcoin ETF proposal.","Nov 19, 2019",The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is reviewing its decision to reject the Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) filing from Bitwise Asset Management and NYSE Arca.,"In an announcement on Nov. 18, the commission said that the ETF filing from Bitwise Asset Management and NYSE Arca will return to review, following the earlier rejection for not meeting the necessary requirements.In October the U.S. regulators said that the applicants did not meet the necessary requirements regarding possible market manipulation and illicit activities. The SEC wrote at the time:""The Commission is disapproving this proposed rule change because, as discussed below, NYSE Arca has not met its burden under the Exchange Act and the Commission’s Rules of Practice to demonstrate that its proposal is consistent with the requirements of Exchange Act Section6(b)(5), and, in particular, the requirement that the rules of a national securities exchange be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices.”One of the regulator’s major concerns when evaluating new commodity-based ETFs is establishing whether the underlying market is resistant to manipulation. In the SEC order that rejected Bitwise’s application, the commissioners wrote that the evidence insufficiently supported the claim that the “real” spot market for Bitcoin, when “fake and/or non-economic data is removed,” is sufficiently resistant to manipulation.However, today the regulator announced that it is reviewing the proposal, so once again, any party or person may file a statement in support of, or in opposition to, the action made pursuant to delegated authority, no later than Dec. 18, 2019.The SEC further points out that the order to disapprove the proposed listing of the ETF filing from Bitwise Asset Management and NYSE Arca will remain in effect pending the Commission's review.Charles Lu, CEO of the confidential ledger protocol Findora, recently said of a realistic timeline for the first crypto ETF approval, that he is doubtful that the process will be quick: “For a bitcoin ETF proposal to gain SEC approval, the sponsor will need to prove that real price discovery is happening as opposed to market manipulation.” Lu did not believe this will happen in the near future, adding: “The SEC will require surveillance-sharing agreements with significant cryptocurrency exchanges — a requirement that few foreign-domiciled exchanges will agree to.”Industry professionals seem to display a certain level of reserved optimism, believing that at some point, the crypto industry will get its coveted prize, but not just yet."

In fact, it’s a log function — so if you double the users hold it, you get a quadrupling of value. To go to $25,000 you essentially need a little less than 4x rise, which means you need to double the number of people who hold Bitcoin.”Lee said that Fundstrat estimates that roughly half a million people own and use Bitcoin so that you would need to hit a million users to get a $25,000 valuation.Noting that this is essentially a utility function, Lee drew an analogy with the performance of FAANG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google) stocks since their public listing. He said:“70% of their return [since public listing] is explained by the growth of the global internet in that period of time. In other words, it’s a LOG function of the internet’s growth, and that’s how cryptocurrencies are going to work.”In terms of other factors, Lee said he was very bullish on Bitcoin in the long term, saying he thinks it’s now “still the earliest days for digital assets” and that over time they’ll become highly institutional and an established asset class. “Once we hit that it’s another hockey stick,” he said, somewhat disconcerting his interviewer with the metaphor.In October, Lee argued that having made a big move at the start of 2019, Bitcoin now needs to consolidate its gains.That same month, the strategist proposed that Bitcoin is positively correlated with the S&P 500 market index and is thus not a hedge against macro turmoil, as some argue."

Bloomberg claims that there is one such machine in every major U.S. city. Fort explained that such services are required to conform to Know Your Customer rules:“They’re required to abide by the same know-your-customer, anti-money laundering regulations, and we believe some have varying levels of adherence to those regulations.”As Cointelegraph reported a month ago, Bitcoin ATM firm Bitstop installed one of its machines at the Miami International Airport, suggesting that Bitcoin is useful to move money when traveling.Fort explained that cryptocurrency taxation issues are an emerging threat, adding that the cryptocurrency space has an inherent lack of transparency and visibility, which increases its potential for non-compliance. Still, he admits that no cases have been filed so far, stating, “We haven’t had any public cases filed, but we do have open cases in inventory.”Earlier this week, Suzanne Sinno, an attorney in the IRS Office of the Associate Chief Counsel, clarified that cryptocurrencies have never been eligible for like-kind tax exemption, even before the 2017 tax overhaul.In the U.S., a like-kind exchange — or a 1031 exchange — is an asset transaction that does not generate a tax liability from the sale of an asset when it was sold to acquire a replacement asset.While crypto traders were mostly aware that post-overhaul transactions do not qualify for such an exemption, transaction eligibility prior to that period had been murky."

Stroustrup made his remarks during an interview for Lex Friedman’s podcast released on Nov. 7.","Speaking with Friedman, Stroustrup provided an extensive insight into the evolution of C++, the language’s concepts, implementations and efficiency. Although Stroustrup noted that programming languages generally have large user bases that use them in ways they were not designed for, he expressed disappointment that Bitcoin’s creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, chose C++ as the fundamental language to write the original implementation of Bitcoin’s source code.Stroustrup continued saying: “When you build a tool, you do not know how it’s going to be used. You try to improve the tool by looking at how it’s being used and when people cut their fingers off to try and stop that from happening, but really, you have no control over how something is used.”Referring to C++ misuse, Stroustrup pointed out massive amounts of electricity used for the leading digital currency mining, as well as its purported deployment for illicit activities. Stroustrup stated:“I'm very happy and proud of some of the things C++ is being used at and some other things I wish people wouldn't do, Bitcoin mining being my favorite example — it uses as much energy as Switzerland and mostly serves criminals.”Some industry players have attempted to find a solution to energy consumption in Bitcoin mining. In September, Bitcoin mining infrastructure firm Northern Bitcoin AG completed tests for its new air-cooled mining container. The company operates BTC-focused mining hardware that uses renewable energy sources and aims to attain optimal efficiency and sustainability.The same month, it was reported that Bitcoin energy consumption was becoming rapidly more efficient. Despite more computing power being dedicated to Bitcoin mining, less electricity was required to fuel it."

fraudulent investment ads following local billionaire and television ...","Nov 11, 2019","A Dutch court has ruled that Facebook must remove Bitcoin (BTC)-related fraudulent investment ads following local billionaire and television producer John de Mol’s lawsuit against the company, Reuters reported on Nov. 11.","De Mol initiated judicial proceedings against the social media giant in June 2019, claiming that Facebook failed to respond to multiple requests to remove ads of a scam that misused his and other celebrities’ images and eventually resulted in the loss of 1.7 million euros ($1.8 million) by investors.Following de Mol’s claim, a Dutch court ruled that Facebook must pull the ads and provide all available information about the individuals who stood behind the scam ads. Otherwise, the social media giant could be fined up to 1.1 million euros ($1.2 million). The court said:“Facebook’s arguments that it is just a neutral funnel for information, and therefore cannot be obligated to act, is not acceptable. The company plays too active a role with respect to advertisements, which form its primary business model, to argue that.”In the court, Facebook ostensibly stated that it had already removed the ads and was considering “all legal actions including an appeal.” Facebook said:“Importantly, this ruling does not change our commitment to fighting these types of ads. We cannot stress enough that these types of ads have absolutely no place on Facebook, and we remove them when we find them.”This was not the first time De Mol had brought up Facebook crypto ads that capitalized on his image. He first encountered the problem in October 2018. At the time, Jacqueline Schaap, a lawyer from De Mol’s legal team, told Cointelegraph via email:“John de Mol noticed the ads for the first time in October 2018, we do not know whether these were the first adds to appear. We just have not noticed them before, but that does not mean that they have not been published.”Facebook has also been sued in April 2018 by Martin Lewis, a British journalist and TV presenter. Lewis accused the company of defamation related to deceptive cryptocurrency ads. The social media platform banned cryptocurrency-related ads in early 2018. However, the company reversed its stance a few months later by updating its policies to once again allow cryptocurrency ads on the platform, a year before releasing its Libra whitepaper."

They were super excited that this team was accepting Bitcoin [...] We even put a Bitcoin ATM in the arena. Then the Bitcoin price went up to $1,200 and they quit spending the Bitcoin.”When the Kings first launched Bitcoin payments support, the coin was valued at $800 — ten times less than the current price.Montoya remains positive, however. While Bitcoin’s eye-popping appreciation may make merchandise purchases with the coin less appealing, the Kings’ involvement in the cryptocurrency and blockchain sector remains extensive. The team mines Bitcoin in its data center and this year announced a blockchain-based rewards program in partnership with Blockparty. “We have a very tech-savvy ownership group and innovation is a given; it’s part of our DNA,” Montoya said. Season ticket holders, according to Montoya, continue to pay in Bitcoin and the Kings have their sights on an ambitious integration of blockchain across its ecosystem, believing it can reduce friction for fan engagement. The team’s mining center was established largely for educational purposes, he said, with the center leading local workforce development efforts under the MiningForGood program:“We utilize that [the center] to engage the community and teach the youth about STEM education and the importance of blockchain. Students of Sacramento should not be exposed to it 10 years from now, they should understand now that it’s a cool piece of technology and powering these things in the arena.”The Kings have also ventured into crypto-collectibles via a partnership with CryptoKaiju and runs interactive scavenger hunts for its fans, offering them the chance to win Kaiju collectibles connected to sports fan privileges like courtside seats and VIP tours.As reported, the Kings’ blockchain-based rewards program, which launched this October, was integrated into the team’s prediction game Call the Shot. Fans are able to earn blockchain tokens that have no monetary value and can only be redeemed for club-specific prizes.In June 2018, the Kings partnered with crypto mining hardware firm MiningStore to mine top altcoin Ether (ETH) to fund tech education scholarships."

Both are firm records over previous levels.In Bitcoin terms, however, the trading period did not see a noticeable uptick in volume, proof that both countries’ currencies are continuing to weaken. Venezuela traded 627 BTC ($5.5 million), while Argentina’s tally totaled 30 BTC ($263,000).As Cointelegraph reported, inflation continues to be a major problem for the governments in both Caracas and Buenos Aires, with Argentina’s change of government only serving to make matters worse for the economy. Last week, the central bank formally banned consumers from purchasing Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency using credit cards.Venezuelans meanwhile continue to hit out at their regime’s state-backed cryptocurrency Petro, introduced on a semi-mandatory basis last year. “Printing physical worthless money is expensive and has challenging logistics. This is why Venezuela is going ‘Petro’ — to screw the people out their savings in real-time, with no printing costs at all,” Mauricio Di Bartolomeo, co-founder of Bitcoin finance startup Ledn, summarized about the situation on Nov. 7. He added: “The Venezuelan Petro is everything Bitcoin stands against.”According to the Financial Times on Sunday, Venezuela is being forced to sell cheap blends of oil at a significant discount due to the mounting impact of United States’ sanctions on the government.Oil revenues are now down to just $250 million per month, compared with up to $5 billion prior to the financial crisis."

Utrust CEO, Nuno Correia, said:“For business or leisure, flight travel can be expensive with consumers saving for months to afford a trip. Considered a high ticket item, it is imperative that consumers are protected when booking flights. Utrust is providing Alternative Airlines’ customers with the increased security and convenience of cryptocurrency payments, and reducing processing fees, to bring greater transparency and trust to the world of online payments.”In August, it was reported that Portuguese sports club SL Benfica had partnered with Utrust to facilitate payments via cryptocurrency for tickets and merchandise. The new payment option will allow fans and customers to buy tickets and any products on the club’s website with Utrust’s native token (UTK), and with top cryptocurrencies Bitcoin and ether.For those who wish to fly from the Miami International Airport and pay for their tickets with BTC, Bitcoin ATM firm Bitstop just installed one of its machines at the airport in mid-October. The airport’s first Bitcoin ATM was last reported to be in concourse G, next to gate 16. Bitstop co-founder and chief strategy officer Doug Carrillo pointed out that more and more people prefer to travel with Bitcoin instead of cash for convenience and security.

Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba before Singles' Day marketing ...","Nov 18, 2019",Bitcoin (BTC) rewards shopping app Lolli has responded to Alibaba’s denial of a partnership between the two companies following Singles’ Day marketing blitz.,"CEO of Lolli Alex Adelman refuted Alibaba’s denial of partnership with Lolli. In an email to Cointelegraph on Nov 17, Adelman maintained that Lolli did have a partnership with the Alibaba Group, saying:“We’ve been partnered with Alibaba Group since May through AliExpress. We have driven AliExpress significant revenue and distributed bitcoin rewards to our users.”It was previously reported that Lolli introduced an affiliate partnership with Alibaba enabling its shoppers to earn 5% back in Bitcoin on Singles’ Day.Subsequently, Alibaba denied any such partnership. A representative from Alibaba told CoinDesk that Lolli “never had the right to claim a partnership with Alibaba.com or imply one with Alibaba Group.”It is possible that Alibaba reacted so strongly to the suggestion of the partnership after the Singles’ Day marketing campaign got a little too popular, with some outlets equating it with Alibaba accepting Bitcoin. Given the Chinese government’s hostile attitude towards Bitcoin, Alibaba may have been keen to avoid such associations.Adelman maintains that this was unfair to Lolli. “Lolli and the agency representing Alibaba.com mutually agreed to launch this partnership in conjunction with Singles’ Day,” he told Cointelegraph, adding:“Alibaba.com trialed our services for 24 hours and decided to deactivate the partnership without cause — breaking its contract [...] The agency representing Alibaba.com approved a contractual agreement on behalf of Alibaba.com that included the promotion of Alibaba.com, the use of its brand, email marketing, and sharing on social media and various channels. There was no malintent on our end to misrepresent Alibaba.”Adelman continued to say that allowing Alibaba to deny the partnership would be “misleading and defames our brand when we did nothing wrong and abided by everything we contractually agreed upon with them.”He concluded by saying that although there was “miscommunication on Alibaba’s end and while that’s unfortunate, we look forward to the possibility of working with Alibaba.com again in the future.”The Chinese retail giant has not been friendly to Bitcoin to date. In October, Alibaba’s digital payment arm Alipay reiterated its negative stance toward Bitcoin, confirming that it will be banning all transactions identified as connected to Bitcoin. Alipay wrote:“If any transactions are identified as being related to bitcoin or other virtual currencies, @Alipay immediately stops the relevant payment services.”"

Another FAANG company has its sights on financial services — this time ...","Nov 19, 2019","Another FAANG company has its sights on financial services — this time it’s Google, as Forbes reported on Nov. 16, polemically claiming this could “kill Bitcoin.”","In an interview with the Wall Street Journal last week, Google had revealed plans — devised under a project code-named Cache — to launch consumer checking accounts in partnership with Citigroup. For cryptocurrency veterans, the inauspicious history of Google’s choice of banking partner will not go unremarked: on the eve of the 2008 global financial crisis, Citigroup CEO Chuck Prince was still telling journalists that “as long as the music is playing, you’ve got to get up and dance. We’re still dancing.”The ailing, sprawling titan Citigroup would be revealed as an institution with one of the most toxic balance sheets in the industry: “by the summer of 2007, Citigroup alone was guaranteed $92.7 billion in ABCP [asset-backed commercial paper], enough to wipe out its entire Tier 1 capital,” as the historian Adam Tooze has noted in his history of the crisis.Bailing out Citi — and salvaging the wider, ailing and systemically dangerous banking sector — would later force the Federal Reserve to undertake colossal liquidity actions as a “global lender of last resort” and to introduce regulation firmly entrenching the interdependence of the financial sector and government.At the time, as Tooze writes, Sheila Bair of the FDIC pointedly remarked that certain of the Fed’s subsequent, more intrusive actions seemed little more than “a smokescreen put up to hide a bailout of Citigroup” — whose collapse could not be countenanced in the aftermath of Lehman.As the WSJ noted in its coverage, tech firms such as Google view financial services as a conduit to getting “closer to their users” and acquiring highly valuable data on their transactions and economic behavior.A McKinsey & Co. survey of consumers cited by the WSJ revealed that 58% of respondents said they would trust Google’s financial products — as compared with 35% for Facebook, 56% for Apple and 65% for Amazon.Google has claimed it doesn’t use its existing Google Pay data — a service that counted 11 million U.S. users in 2018, according to Forbes — for advertising purposes and that it doesn’t share that data with third parties.According to WSJ’s report, Google’s project with Citigroup will aim to foreground financial institutions’ brands instead of Google’s — and leave the compliance and financial “plumbing” to the banks. Google executive Caesar Sengupta told the WSJ — in an apparent attempt to distinguish the project from initiatives like Facebook’s Libra — that:“Our approach is going to be to partner deeply with banks and the financial system. It may be the slightly longer path, but it’s more sustainable.”Forbes’ polemical argument that Google’s foray into digital finance will “kill Bitcoin” has therefore been scorned by figures in the cryptocurrency sector, all too aware of the issues associated with institutional intermediation, data-privacy and digital security. As Bitcoin educator Stephen Cole has quipped:“A Google checking account threatens Bitcoin about as much as a new post office threatens email.”The Citigroup partnership isn’t the first Google story to prompt the bell-ringers of Bitcoin’s purportedly imminent death in recent weeks: Google is reported to have recently achieved quantum supremacy, sparking some speculation as to how future-proof and resistant the cryptography of the Bitcoin blockchain will prove to be. Yet, as Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has commented of the perceived threat:“My one-sentence impression of recent quantum supremacy stuff so far is that it is to real quantum computing what hydrogen bombs are to nuclear fusion. Proof that a phenomenon and the capability to extract power from it exist, but still far from directed use toward useful things.”Buterin’s argument is shared by Andreas Antonopoulos, who has characterized the danger of quantum for Bitcoin as “zip, bupkis nada.”"

According to ...","Nov 21, 2019",Bitcoin-cautious Germany has seen its first bank demand that ordinary savers pay it to hold their money — even as little as €1.,"According to multiple local press outlets including the Süddeutsche Zeitung on Nov. 19, the Volksbank Raiffeisenbank Fürstenfeldbruck (VRF) in Northern Bavaria is now charging 0.5% negative interest rates on the smallest deposits.“We had to do it,” the publication quoted the bank’s management as saying. The reason, they said, was the cost of “parking” money at the European Central Bank (ECB). In Germany, negative interest rates previously impacted only deposits above €100,000, which constituted an interest-free allowance. VRF’s move makes it the first lender in the country to target savings below that level.“Recently, more clients have been coming to us from other banks where they’ve already used up their allowance,” the management continued.As Cointelegraph reported, negative interest rates are beginning to form part of the ECB’s monetary policy. The phenomenon ultimately means that some portion of savers must pay banks to hold their money.Critics have warned that such moves would incentivize the public to move into cash, while alternatives such as Bitcoin (BTC) also stand to benefit. By contrast, Bitcoin does not suffer from the inflationary meddling in its supply and associated destruction of its value, meaning HODLers would never be forced to pay to own it.Last month, entrepreneur Cameron Winklevoss noted the cryptocurrency was the ideal method of escaping negative rates on bonds, which account for investments worth $17 trillion. Speaking to Süddeutsche Zeitung meanwhile, the CEO of a German consumer portal warned that VRF could “open the floodgates.”“We’re seeing a lot of movement on the market at present,” Oliver Maier said. He noted that the ECB’s decision to cut its benchmark interest rate for banks to -0.5% from -0.4% was the cause of the upset."

He continued: “I‘ve since come to realize that it was extremely dangerous & irresponsible to push for a contentious hard fork w/o replay protection, esp. when there wasn’t consensus. Mea culpa! Bitcoin is the real Bitcoin.”SegWit2x was widely viewed as an attempt by its corporate sponsors to commandeer Bitcoin’s development, contrary to the ethos of decentralization. At the time, Lee’s willingness to embrace it saw pushback even from his own brother, Litecoin (LTC) creator Charlie Lee, who described his perspective as “extremely lame.”The scheme, also known as the New York Agreement or NYA, surfaced at a time when BTC/USD was beginning the run-up to its all-time highs of $20,000, and transaction fees were considerably higher than current levels. Other participants dissatisfied with the status quo attempted to resolve the situation via other means, notably the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) hard fork in August 2017. Still a source of contention, BCH supporters maintain that the altcoin is in fact the “real” Bitcoin. On this, Lee was also dismissive.“In Bitcoin, there’s the notion of consensus where the majority of hash power decides on the real chain. Similarly in our world, the market decides on the real Bitcoin, the one with the most market value,” he wrote.Asked whether he believed BCH could lay claim to being Bitcoin, he concluded: “To me, it’s pretty obvious that the market has already decided. Signal vs Noise.”Last week, Lee stated he believed Bitcoin would rise to $500,000 by 2028, and could ultimately become worth millions of dollars."

Still, after its completion, the data center will also allow for the acceleration of video rendering and artificial intelligence applications.Northern Bitcoin is a stock-traded company founded last year that specializes in sustainable Bitcoin mining. The firm operates a mining farm on renewable energy in Norway.The idea of placing the world’s largest mining facility in the U.S. is interesting, given that China has so far been at the forefront of the cryptocurrency mining industry and hosts many of the leading companies of the industry, such as Bitmain.According to a recent analysis, low power costs in addition to access to cheap hardware make China a competitive destination for cryptocurrency mining operations, despite the country’s legal environment."

With this integration, any crypto tradeable on Binance.com will become accessible for those who purchase USDT via WazirX.In an interview with Cointelegraph, Kashif Raza — co-founder of the Indian crypto regulatory news and analysis platform “Crypto Kanoon” — welcomed the development, suggesting that the acquisition will provide a major morale boost to the Indian startup space at a time of deep regulatory uncertainty.This uncertainty is highly likely to have played a role in WazirX’s decision to join forces with a major industry incumbent like Binance, he added.Back in July 2018 — in the aftermath of the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) controversial ban on banks' dealings with crypto-related firms — WazirX had transformed its business model into a P2P platform so as to avoid in-house crypto-fiat conversion.Other exchanges, like Coindelta, have since been forced to terminate services altogether in light of the adverse operating climate for crypto businesses in the countryIn a statement, Binance Chief Financial Officer Wei Zhou remarked that “building fiat-to-crypto bridges remain a key mission for Binance,” adding that the acquisition of WazirX will help Binance in this mission “by providing a simple and cohesive way to purchase cryptocurrencies in a country which is home to more than a billion people.""Binance’s chief executive Changpeng Zhao has said the move represents “another step forward in achieving the freedom of money.” As reported, the Indian government recently revealed it has opted not to introduce a draft bill on a potential cryptocurrency ban to parliament in the coming winter session.The draft bill — entitled “Banning of Cryptocurrency & Regulation of Official Digital Currencies” — reportedly intends not only to impose a complete ban on the use of crypto in India but also to pave the way for a “Digital Rupee” issued by the Reserve Bank of India.In late October, Binance launched support for deposits in Nigerian Naira (NGN), announcing that they would add support for fiat trading earlier that month, starting with the Russian ruble. In mid-October, it launched p2p trading for Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH) and USDT against the Chinese yuan and this month added support for the Turkish lira on its flagship exchange.To date, Binance has also launched four international crypto-fiat exchanges, including Binance Uganda, European trading platform Binance Jersey, Binance Singapore and Binance US."

Preska’s ruling on Nov. 19, the U.S. government — in this case, represented by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) — now has the right to intervene in civil proceedings that are running parallel to a criminal multimillion Bitcoin scam case.Thompson, a resident of Easton, Pennsylvania, is charged with “knowingly or recklessly making false representations to customers in connection with the purported purchase of Bitcoins worth over $7 million.” Preska stated:“Upon the consent of all relevant parties, the Government’s application to intervene in the above entitled matter and to stay the matter in its entirety until the conclusion of the parallel criminal case, United States v. Jon Barry Thompson [...] is granted.”The case was initiated by the CFTC in late September, which claimed that after receiving clients’ funds, Thompson, the head of a Bitcoin escrow service, sent virtually all of the money to third parties.

This ...","Nov 11, 2019",The crypto markets are going through a phase of uncertainty with several cryptocurrencies failing to show a firm trend. This is because the markets lack a catalyst that can either pull prices higher or plunge them lower. ,"However, a developing catalyst could be the launch of the China-backed central bank digital currency (CBDC). Jack Lee, a founding partner at HCM Capital, believes that China’s central bank is ready and the digital currency could be launched within the next two to three months. If this experiment is successful, it would likely force the other developed nations to follow suit.Daily cryptocurrency market performance. Source: Coin360Another catalyst that could prove bullish for the crypto market is the continuous inflow of institutional money. However, this has not yet materialized due to a variety of reasons. Bakkt has announced that it has received approval from the New York Department of Financial Services to offer crypto custody services to any institution. Bakkt expects this move to increase institutional adoption.However, not everyone is bullish on the crypto space. The European Central Bank’s former president Jean-Claude Trichet is “strongly against Bitcoin” and does not consider it as a currency.   Therefore the question must be asked. Should traders view the current dip in Bitcoin price as a buying opportunity, or can the leading cryptocurrency surprise investors with additional moves to the downside? Let’s study the charts to see what signals the market is providing.Bitcoin (BTC) attempted to rebound off the critical support at $8,777.89 on Nov. 10 but the bounce fizzled out just above the $9,080 mark. This shows that higher levels are attracting profit booking.   Currently, the price has again dipped to the support at $8,777.89. If this level fails to hold, the BTC/USD pair could dip to $8,467.54, which is 61.8% retracement of the most recent up move. This is an important level to watch out for because if it cracks, a drop to $7,297.21 is possible.Conversely, if the pair bounces off the 50-day SMA, the bulls will again attempt to clear the downtrend line and retest the recent highs of $10,360.89. We will wait for the pair to breakout and close (UTC time) above the downtrend line before recommending a trade.For the past few days, Ether (ETH) has been trading within the intraday high and intraday low made on Oct. 26. A breakout of $197.75 will be a positive move that can carry the price to the overhead resistance zone of $223.999 to $235.70. Conversely, if the bears sink the price below the support at $173.841, it can decline to $161.056-$151.829 support zone. If this zone holds, the ETH/USD pair might remain range-bound for a few more days. Our view will be invalidated if the pair breaks below $151.829. In such a case, the downtrend will resume. Therefore, traders can protect the long positions with stops at $150.XRP is looking weak as it hardly bounced after the steep fall on Nov. 7 and 8. This shows that the bulls are not using the dips to buy as they expect the price to slide further. The next support to watch on the downside is $0.24508. If this support also cracks, a retest of $0.22 will be on the cards. Therefore, traders can protect their long positions with stops at $0.24.Contrary to our assumption, if the XRP/USD pair reverses direction from the current levels and breaks out of $0.31491, it can rally to $0.34229. However, with the moving averages starting to turn down and the RSI in the negative territory, advantage is with the bears and a rally looks unlikely.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has again hit a wall close to the neckline of the head and shoulders pattern. This suggests that the bears are aggressively defending this resistance level. If the price slips below the 20-day EMA, it can decline to $241.85. Therefore, traders can trail the stop loss on the long positions to $267. However, if the BCH/USD pair turns up from the current level and sustains above the neckline, it can rise to $360. This is a significant resistance, hence, traders can book partial profits closer to $360 and keep a close stop loss on the rest of the position. Litecoin (LTC) is struggling to find buyers above $62.0764. It has again dipped to the 20-day EMA. If the bears sink the price below the moving averages, the altcoin can drop to the critical support at $50. A breakdown of $47.1851 will be a huge negative and will resume the downtrend.However, if the support at $50 holds, a few days of consolidation is possible. The flattening moving averages and the RSI just above 50 level also suggests a range formation.Alternatively, if the LTC/USD pair bounces off the moving averages and rises above $66.1486, it can move up to $80.2731. The traders can protect their long positions with stops at $47. We shall trail the stops higher at the first available opportunity.EOS is sandwiched between 20-day EMA and $3.69 for the past few days. The bears are aggressively defending the downtrend line. If the altcoin breaks below $3.3137, a drop to $2.9980 is likely. A break below this level will be a huge negative as it can drag the price to $2.4001. Conversely, if the EOS/USD pair bounces off the 20-day EMA and breaks out of the downtrend line, it is likely to pick up momentum and rally to $4.24 and above it to $4.8719. Traders can continue to hold their long positions with a stop loss of $2.95.Binance Coin (BNB) has been trading between the 20-day EMA and $21.2378 for the past few days. A breakout of $21.2378 can push the price to $23.5213 and above it to $30. However, if the bears sink the price below the 20-day EMA, a drop to the 50-day SMA is likely.The 50-day SMA, the horizontal support and the uptrend line are all situated close to each other. Hence, we expect the bulls to defend it aggressively. If the BNB/USD pair bounces off this support, it will consolidate between $18.30 and $21.2378 for a few days. The pair will turn negative if it breaks down of the critical support and re-enters the channel. For now, traders can keep the stop loss on the long positions at $16. We will recommend trailing the stops higher within the next few days.Bitcoin SV (BSV) is trading inside a channel that is descending down marginally. The next decisive move will start after the price escapes the channel. If the bulls manage to push the price above the channel, a move to $188.69 is likely. Though there is a resistance at $155.38, we expect it to be crossed.Conversely, if the price breaks down of the channel, a drop to $107 is possible. The short-term traders can buy on a bounce off the support line of the channel and book profits closer to the resistance line of the channel. However, we suggest positional traders wait until the BSV/USD pair breaks out and closes (UTC time) above the channel for establishing any positions. Stellar (XLM) bounced sharply from the 20-day EMA in the past two days. However, it is facing profit booking just above the $0.080 mark. This shows that bulls are keen to buy on dips to strong support levels and the bears are attempting to defend the overhead resistance levels. This could result in a consolidation for a few days until one party emerges victorious.The critical level to watch on the upside is $0.088708. If this level is scaled, the XLM/USD pair can move up to $0.145. On the other hand, if the pair breaks below the 20-day EMA, it can drop to the 50-day SMA. We do not find any buy setup that offers an attractive risk to reward ratio, hence, we suggest traders remain on the sidelines.Tron (TRX) has been clinging to the support for the past three days. However, the failure to bounce off it indicates a lack of urgency among buyers. If the bears sink the price below $0.0183603, a drop to the 50-day SMA is likely.Both moving averages are flattening out and the RSI has dipped close to the midpoint. This suggests a consolidation for a few days.However, if the TRX/USD pair bounces off the current levels and breaks above $0.0204880, it can move up to $0.02340. We will turn positive above $0.0204880. Until then, we remain neutral on the pair.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

Recently protestors set several buildings on fire and one among them was a branch of Iran's central bank in Behbahan, a city located in the southwestern region of the country. ","Such events underline the importance of cryptocurrencies because crypto is the only asset class which cannot be controlled or manipulated by leaders and regulators. Though many suggest that gold can also work as a safe haven during such situations, history shows that governments tend to put capital controls on gold as well. So, that leaves cryptocurrencies as the only alternative. Daily cryptocurrency market performance. Source: Coin360While many analysts are certain that digital asset valuations will increase over the long-term, the short-term price action paints a different picture. Bitcoin has been gradually declining, which has also pulled altcoins also lower. However, an interesting development is that a few altcoins are attempting to form a bottom. Let’s have a look at the charts to determine which are moving higher and what are the critical levels to watch out for?Bitcoin (BTC) has been trading below the 50-day SMA for the past two days. This is a negative sign and it shows that there is no urgency among the bulls to buy even at these levels. The 20-day EMA has started to turn down and the relative strength index (RSI) has dipped into negative territory, which suggests that bears have the upper hand.A decisive breakdown below the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of $8,467.54 is likely to attract further selling that can drag the price to $7,952.84.Conversely, if the BTC/USD pair bounces off the current levels and breaks out of the downtrend line, it will signal that the current fall was a bear trap. We anticipate the pair to start a new uptrend above the downtrend line. Therefore, we will wait for the price to breakout and close (UTC time) above the downtrend line before turning positive. While several cryptocurrencies are breaking below their support levels, Ether (ETH) remains stable. This is a positive sign as it shows that the bulls are not hurrying to close their positions. Both moving averages are flat and the RSI is close to the center, which indicates that the range-bound action might continue for a few more days.Longer the consolidation, stronger will be the eventual breakout or breakdown from it. We anticipate the next move to be a strong one.If the price breaks out of the overhead resistance at $197.75, a rally to $235.70 will be on the cards. On the other hand, if the bears sink the price below $173.841, a retest of $161.056 to $151.829 support zone is likely. The downtrend will resume on a break below this zone. Therefore, traders can continue to hold their long positions with stops at $150.The attempt to pullback on Nov. 15 did not find buyers at higher levels. As a result, XRP has resumed its journey towards the next support at $0.24508. The moving averages have completed a bearish crossover and the RSI continues to trade in the negative zone, which shows that bears are firmly in command.A break below $0.24508 will be a huge negative that can drag the price to the next support at $0.22. Hence, traders can retain a stop loss on the long positions at $0.24.Conversely, if the XRP/USD pair bounces off the support at $0.24508, the bulls will try to push it above the moving averages. If successful, it will remain range-bound between $0.24508 and $0.31491 for the next few days.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has been trading below the 20-day EMA and the previous support turned resistance of $269.10 for the past two days. The attempt by the bulls to scale above this resistance failed on Nov. 17. This shows a lack of demand at higher levels.The next support on the downside is at the 50-day SMA and below it $241.85. We anticipate the bulls to defend this level aggressively. If this support holds, the bulls will again attempt to carry the BCH/USD pair above the overhead resistance at $269.10.Conversely, if the support at $241.85 breaks down, the pair might slip to the next support at $203.36. We will wait for the price to signal a turn around before recommending a long position once again.Litecoin (LTC) has been stuck between its moving averages for the past three days. This tight range trading shows that both bulls and bears are playing it safe and are not taking any directional bets.Above the 20-day EMA, the LTC/USD pair will again hit a wall in the $62.0764 to $66.1486 resistance zone. The pair will pick up momentum on a breakout of $66.1486Conversely, if the bears sink the price below the 50-day SMA, a drop to the $50 - $47.1851 support zone is possible. If this zone breaks down, the downtrend will resume. Therefore, traders can retain the stop loss on the long positions at $47.EOS has been trading close to the critical support at $3.37 for the past few days. Though the price dipped below the support on Nov. 15, the bears could not capitalize on it. This shows buying at lower levels.Both the moving averages are flat and the RSI is just above the midpoint, which suggests a balance between both bulls and bears. The balance will tilt in favor of the bulls if the EOS/USD pair climbs above $3.69 and the downtrend line. Alternatively, the bears will have the upper hand if the price sustains below $3.37. For now, the traders can keep the stop loss on the long positions at $2.95.The failure of the bulls to defend the 20-day EMA is a bearish sign. Binance Coin (BNB) can now dip to the 50-day SMA, which is just above the uptrend line and the horizontal support at $18.30.We expect the bulls to defend this support aggressively. If the altcoin bounces off this support, the bulls will again try to propel the price above the overhead resistance of $21.2378. Conversely, if the bears sink the BNB/USD pair below the uptrend line, a drop to the next support at $16.50 is possible. If this support also breaks down, a decline to $14.2555 is likely. For now, traders can protect their long positions with stops at $16. We could suggest closing the position if the pair dips below $18.30.Bitcoin SV (BSV) has been trading below the 20-day EMA for the past three days but the bears have not been able to break below the descending channel. The bulls are attempting to provide some support close to $120 levels. The 20-day EMA is flat and the RSI is just below the 50 level, which suggests a range-bound action for a few more days.If the bulls can push the price above the 20-day EMA, a retest of the resistance line of the descending channel is likely. A breakout of the channel will be the first indication that bulls are back in command.Conversely, if the BSV/USD pair slides below the minor support at $120, a dip to $107 is possible. We will wait for a new buy setup to form before proposing a trade in it.Stellar (XLM) has broken below a slew of support levels, which is a bearish sign. It shows that sellers are dominating the proceedings. The next stop is likely to be the 50-day SMA, which is located just below the horizontal support of $0.067457. If this support also fails to hold, a drop to $0.062122 and below it to $0.056 is possible.However, if the XLM/USD pair finds support close to the 50-day SMA, the bulls will again attempt to climb above the support turned resistance of $0.072545. The flattish 20-day EMA and the RSI just below the 50 suggests further range-bound action for a few days. We will wait for the pair to signal a reversal before recommending a trade in it.After trading close to the critical support at $0.018660 for the past two days, Tron (TRX) has resumed its decline. Its next stop is likely to be the 50-day SMA. If the 50-day SMA holds, we might see another attempt by the bulls to make a recovery above $0.018660.However, if the 50-day SMA breaks, the TRX/USD pair can plummet to the next support at $0.0136655. Such a move will be a huge negative and will weaken sentiment further. Therefore, we will wait for the price to signal a turn around before suggesting a trade in it. The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

On July 25, a U.S. federal grand jury indicted Karlsson on charges of alleged securities fraud, wire fraud and money laundering.Karlsson allegedly used Eastern Metal Securities, as well as an array of false online identities, to funnel investors into paying $98 per share in the company on the promise of an eventual payout of 1.15 kilograms of gold per share — as of press time, worth nearly $60,000.Operating this business remotely, Karlsson took payment from investors using virtual currencies including Bitcoin, on the promise of returning 97% of the value of their initial investment in the event that the gold payout did not pan out. The DoJ says that 3,575 people invested a total of over $11 million in Karlsson’s scheme. Per the release, that money is now tied up in Thailand’s real estate market.Late last week, a founder of massive ponzi scheme OneCoin, which centered around a cryptocurrency that didn’t exist, pleaded guilty to charges including fraud and money laundering.

approval for the launch of a crypto derivatives exchange. 2644 Total ...","Nov 8, 2019",New York-based financial technology firm Tassat — formerly known as  trueDigital — has succeeded in overcoming the first hurdle in its bid to launch a fully-regulated crypto derivatives exchange.,"According to an announcement from the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) on Nov. 7, the regulator has approved the transfer of a swap execution facility (SEF) registration from fellow New York-based financial services firm trueEX to Tassat.Tassat had first reached the agreement in principle to acquire —  subject to CFTC approval — trueEx’s SEF registration back in July of this year. The company is now waiting for news regarding its prospective acquisition of trueEx’s Designated Contract Market (DCM) registration, which would allow it to operate an exchange listing futures or options contracts with oversight from the CFTC.In its press release, the CFTC stated that trueEX and Tassat fulfilled the requirement for transferring a SEF registration by providing evidence that Tassat would be able to operate in compliance with the provisions of the U.S. Commodity Exchange Act and related CFTC regulations.The agency revealed that there are now a total of 19 registered SEFs, including Tassat, and noted that TrueEX had been granted its registration as a SEF by the CFTC on Jan. 22, 2016.The registration brings Tassat closer to launching a crypto derivatives exchange with full oversight from the CFTC, where it hopes to list physically-delivered Bitcoin (BTC) derivatives for institutional investors. As CEO Thomas Kim said in July when the plans were first unveiled: “Adding the exchange to our ecosystem delivers a complete end-to-end offering, currently unavailable today, that encompasses tokenization, payments, market data and settlement for the benefit of our clients and partners.”In March, Tassat — when it was still known as trueDigital — had partnered with crypto data firm Kaiko and digital assets analytics company Inca Digital Securities to widen the distribution of its over-the-counter reference rates for Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH), the latter of which it created in partnership with ConsenSys.TrueDigital was initially established as a subsidiary of TrueEx, which has long been active in the crypto space and was the first in the industry to secure a DCM registration for Bitcoin swaps from the CFTC back in 2012.This summer, another crypto exchange ErisX, procured a derivatives clearing organization license from the CFTC as part of its plans to make digital asset futures contracts available for trade on its regulated derivatives market later this year."

recent single-whale theory of the 2017 Bitcoin bull run. 3659 Total ...","Nov 19, 2019",Blockchain education platform Longhash has released research that it claims debunks the recent single-whale theory of the 2017 Bitcoin (BTC) bull run.,"On Nov. 18, researchers at crypto analytics firm Longhash announced that they have calculated a metric called “Tether Purchasing Power,” which shows more insight into the question of whether Tether (USDT) was used to manipulate the cryptocurrency markets.According to Longhash, the metric measures how much BTC could be bought with the entire Tether supply at any given time, pointing out that the higher the ratio, the more likely it is for Tether to potentially manipulate the markets.The researchers show statistics that seem to indicate that during the 2017 bull run, Tether Purchasing Power increased until the summer, but then started to decline towards the end of the year. At that time Bitcoin was still moving towards an all-time-high. Longhash’s data seems to indicate that Tether has a chance to manipulate the markets when BTC is in a downward price trend, as it shot up significantly during the bear market, reaching its peak at the end of 2018. The researchers said:“This suggests that even if Tether were indeed manipulating the market, its ability to do so actually is strongest when the Bitcoin price falls. This contradicts the claim that Tether issuance drove the 2017 bull market. The supply of Tether actually failed to keep up during the height of the bull market.”The recently updated academic paper titled “Is Bitcoin Really Un-Tethered?” suggested that one single player or entity was allegedly responsible for Bitcoin’s historic price surge at the end of 2017. According to the paper, the Tether stablecoin and its issuer Bitfinex played a key role in the alleged hoax.Bitfinex denied all allegations, calling the publication “a transparent attempt to use the semblance of academia for a mercenary money grab.” Many analysts agree and laugh off the single whale theory, saying that while the crypto market is not immune to manipulation, to assume that someone could single-handedly drive the prices up to such an extent is quite a stretch.Juan Villaverde and Martin Weiss of Weiss Ratings agency called it “preposterous” when speaking with Cointelegraph, adding:“There is abundant anecdotal evidence that throws great doubt on the one-large-player theory. For example, exchanges were swamped and not able to onboard new customers. Google searches for “Bitcoin” and “cryptocurrency” were off the charts. New crypto businesses and ICOs were popping up every day. All of this — and more — suggests that the crypto surge of 2017 was very much a mass phenomenon, with heavy public participation.”"

China’s central bank, the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) — one of its members — could soon become the world’s first major economy to issue its own digital currency. Cœuré commented:“I look forward to bringing my expertise to the global central banking community at this time of rapid technological change. We must make the best use of innovation to support financial stability and promote financial inclusion.”The Hub will operate in Hong Kong and Singapore, in addition to the BIS’ home of Switzerland. As Cointelegraph reported, the BIS agreed to partner with the Swiss National Bank (SNB) at the Hub in early October. “The SNB has for some time been closely following the digitalization of the financial sector and technological innovations in the areas covered by its mandate,” Thomas J. Jordan, Chairman of the Governing Board of the SNB, said at the time. Last year, Cœuré himself described Bitcoin as the “evil spawn of the financial crisis.”"

transfer system built on blockchain as well as the fact that Chinese ...","Nov 14, 2019","Earlier this week, a story published by Chinese state-run media outlet Xinhua featured some pro-Bitcoin comments that referred to the flagship digital currency as being the world’s “first successful application of blockchain technology.”","This latest endorsement comes against the backdrop of China’s stringent anti-crypto stance, wherein the country’s lawmakers implemented a blanket ban on its local cryptocurrency exchanges as well as initial coin offerings back in 2017.The aforementioned Xinhua article takes a balanced approach toward crypto tech, outlining the history of Bitcoin’s development and its overall evolution. It starts off by asking readers the question “Does BTC present the global finance industry with an inevitable trend as far as future currency development goes or is the digital asset just another ‘tulip’ hype?” The piece then proceeds to describe the core tenets of blockchain and how such a decentralized, immutable and trustless technology can be used to facilitate value transfers in a completely peer-to-peer manner. Additionally, it also covers other relevant aspects related to crypto such as mining, digital scarcity and pseudonymity.However, similar to most Western media coverage of cryptocurrencies, the piece then starts to devolve into a sweeping tirade of how Bitcoin is mostly being used by criminals and other nefarious individuals to facilitate black market and darknet transactions — a notion that has been debunked several times over in the past. Not only that, but Xinhua’s writing staff also goes on to highlight the volatility of Bitcoin, citing its lack of central backing as being one of its core weaknesses.To better assess the implications of China’s apparent change of heart toward blockchain tech and Bitcoin, Cointelegraph reached out to Matvey Voytov, the chief marketing officer of Waves Enterprise, a private blockchain solution designed to compete with existing DLT platforms. He believes that China is likely to become the most active blockchain market in the world, as it looks to spend $2 billion on projects by 2023. Voytov further added:“You can’t ignore Bitcoin as being the most successful case of a value transfer system built on blockchain as well as the fact that Chinese investors control a significant part of today’s global bitcoin operations. Still, it doesn’t mean that in the near future China will change its stance on the trading of cryptocurrencies that are not under their control.”Similarly, Peter Somerville, head of node and developer relations for blockchain platform Elixxir, told Cointelegraph that he too is quite optimistic about the future of crypto and blockchain in China. He pointed out that owing to the country’s massive 1.4 billion strong population, there will always be a huge appetite for real-world crypto and blockchain use cases in the region. Additionally, he believes that since the Chinese tech community has played a meaningful role in the development of the industry from its very inception, the local market will soon change its mode of operation from a phase of hype and speculation to laying greater emphasis on projects that seek to innovate and build platforms in order to promote general adoption of these technologies.Lastly, Andre Szykier, the chief technology officer Bitcoin ATM operator Blockchain BTM, told Cointelegraph that with China is seemingly committed to creating a gold-backed security token offering with a stated reserve of 13,000 tons — similar to what Russia has proposed for the ruble. On the topic of Chinese-owned media outlets appearing to tone down their erstwhile stringent opposition to things like Bitcoin mining and speculative cryptocurrency trading, Szykier made an observation that gambling is a fundamental characteristic of social behavior in China, adding that, “Since the government has gone forward in creating a ‘social score’ to reward or punish behavior in the country, cryptocurrency speculation falls into this area.” Szykier concluded:“By controlling the buy/sell activity they can identify and control participants. How this affects the top tier individuals with very large wealth is TBD. The future of retail commerce in China is heavily mobile with ease of interchange between various payment systems highly advanced. By making paper/coin payments a smaller part of retailing, the government can monitor their citizens more closely and perhaps impact their social score.”In order to gauge whether local sentiment toward crypto and blockchain technology in China has actually changed since the 2017 blanket ban came into effect, Cointelegraph reached out to Alex Lam, CEO and co-founder of digital asset services platform RockX. In his view, the Chinese government’s ban — which, at the time, was in response to an increasing amount of unregulated crypto market activity taking place within the country — ended up bringing digital currencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum to the attention of many who had not heard of them before:“In my opinion, the 2017 ban led to no big change in people’s perception of cryptocurrency technologies.”It is no surprise that China, as well as a host of smaller countries, were initially fearful of BTC and blockchain technology for their disruptive potential. However, since China was recently threatened with sanctions and tariffs, the local regime moved to realize that the U.S. dollar and the SWIFT monetary system were being used against it as weapons of war and attrition. The crypto-friendly media reports are now showing that China is truly working toward its goal of widespread blockchain adoption at a rapid pace, and that the country is gearing up for some big changes in the coming few years following President Xi Jinping’s call for adoption. To gain further insights on the matter, Cointelegraph asked Max Pertsovskiy, head of growth at Waves, to comment on whether or not he believes blockchain adoption will continue to increase throughout China in the coming few years. On the subject, he noted that China’s plans have instigated a fire under all potential stakeholders around the globe, as the race for blockchain supremacy is now on:“I believe that over the next decade, nothing will shape the texture of the global economy as the jostling for leverage between China and the United States will. While there are many benefits to central bank digital currencies, the obvious impetus for CBDC was the Libra. China wants to both increase the international reach of the RMB and prevent the spread of the Libra.”Similarly, Ben Golub, CEO of cloud storage platform Storj Labs, is also of the belief that China’s apparent change of heart toward crypto-related technologies could be a sign for bigger things to come for the industry as a whole. Golub told Cointelegraph that China is likely to broaden the lead in blockchain relative to the U.S.:“Until the SEC rolls out more clear guidelines related to cryptocurrencies and blockchain, the US market will continue to stagnate."""

The Lightning network is a payment protocol that allows for fast, micropayments between two so-called nodes — in this case, gamers.Donnerlabs was founded by twenty-five-year-old Konstantin Nick after the 2018 Lightning Hackday in Munich, Germany, as a means to introduce the world’s largest cryptocurrency to more people. The FPS game features an integrated neutrino wallet, where gamers can store coins in a noncustodial fashion, an ad space for Hodl-auctions, and of course the ability to kill off other players in order to collect bounties. In October, Bitcoin-enabled games startup Satoshis Games announced the development of a Fortnite-like game with built-in Lightning Network microtransactions, titled Lightnite, where interactions between players trigger a monetary reward or penalty for the user. Satoshis Games said at the time:“In simple words, players earn Bitcoin by shooting other players and lose Bitcoin when they get shot.”The game reportedly updates in real-time when the player damages another player, gets damaged or picks up an item with BTC value and allows gamers to instantly withdraw their balance via Lightning Network when they wish to do so.In November, the pro-cryptocurrency venture capitalist Tim Draper said that innovations such as the Lightning network would be key in propelling the Bitcoin price higher. Draper believes that Bitcoin could reach $250,000 by 2022 or 2023, in part due to “Bitcoin payment processors”, which “are really going to open the floodgates.” He said:“It’s because of Lightning Network and OpenNode and maybe others that are allowing us to spend Bitcoin very freely and quickly, so that it’s not just a store of value but it can be used for micropayments; it can be used for retail, it can be used all over.”"

After publicly voicing support for blockchain technology last month, Chinese media issued warnings not to confuse the policy for endorsement of phenomena such as Bitcoin. This week, meanwhile, cryptocurrency exchange Binance denied rumors police had raided its office in Shanghai. Shortly afterward, fellow exchange Bithumb similarly rejected the idea it planned to close its Shanghai outpost, while Huobi stated likewise.“We have heard of this from some media reports. However, we have not received any specific instructions at this point,” a Huobi representative said.Commenting on the Shenzhen move, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhang praised what he saw as an effort to remove bad actors.“This is actually a very good thing to happen, cleaning up the industry of scammers and fraudsters,” he wrote in response to PrimitiveCrypto’s founding partner, Dovey Wan.Wan had claimed that the targets of the shutdown were “most likely are ponzi and crypto frauds as Shenzhen is known for being the hub of those.”"

Other targets reportedly include mining and livestock companies in South America.In a purported manifesto published on Friday, Phineas Fisher said that he will pay hackers in cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin (BTC) or privacy-oriented coin Monero (XMR).Phineas Fisher, who has never been identified and may be an individual or a group of hackers, reportedly stated:“Hacking to obtain and leak documents with public interest is one of the best ways for hackers to use their abilities to benefit society [...] I’m not trying to make anyone rich. I’m just trying to provide enough funds so that hackers can make a decent living doing a good job.”As reported by Vice, Phineas Fisher’s identity has never been made public — even after an investigation into the famous Hacking Team hack. In 2015, Phineas Fisher took over the servers of the Hacking Team, an Italian firm providing hacking and surveillance software for police and corporations, in order to expose all the company’s secrets in a 400-gigabyte torrent file containing internal emails, files, and source code. After an extensive investigation, Italian authorities reportedly said that they had no idea who Phineas Fisher was.As Phineas Fisher has remained anonymous since 2014 and recently announced the controversial bounty, the anonymity of hacktivism has raised major concerns among nations so far. Andrew Thompson, a manager at the cybersecurity firm FireEye, tweeted Nov. 17 that he has “zero percent trust in anything portrayed as hacktivism, which is anonymous.”On Nov. 14, Cointelegraph reported on an anonymous organization called Unknown Fund, which plans to donate $75 million in Bitcoin to startups focused on anonymity and the protection of personal data."

While upholding his/her/their desired anonymity, he nonetheless shared some of the donor(s)’ edited remarks, including reported statements such as:“Our motives are not economical! It’s about the technology and the protocol. Please put it to good use for the development of GRIN. You keep working as you did in the past [...] This is what we are honouring right now with these donations so that you can work freely [...] without economic dependencies.”Apparently finding the unusual nature of the donation to be not quite enough, some cryptocurrency media outlets responded by confecting the theory that Satoshi Nakomoto — Bitcoin’s mysterious inventor(s) — was behind the donation. The theory was fed by an apparent Telegram group chat message from Litecoin (LTC) founder Charlie Lee revealing that the donated coins were mined in 2010, and transferred from a wallet that had been idle for almost 9 years.Lee has since confirmed the message was “just a joke.”As previously reported, Grin is a privacy coin that implements scalability- and privacy-focused Mimblewimble protocol  — named after a fictional tongue-tying curse from the popular Harry Potter novels.Mimblewimble is in part a variant of the cryptographic protocol known as Confidential Transactions, which allows for transactions to be obfuscated yet verifiable so as to achieve both heightened privacy and the prevention of double-spending.This summer, Grin underwent a hard fork — the network’s first since its launch in mid-January of this year — to introduce tweaks to its consensus algorithm in order to achieve greater resistance to ASIC miners.This October, the Litecoin Foundation published two new draft improvement proposals designed to work toward establishing privacy features for the network by integrating Mimblewimble."

Source: Coin360While the long-term outlook looks good, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has warned that only 1% of the cryptocurrencies in existence now will survive. However, the ones that survive are likely to grow significantly. Should traders buy the current dip in major cryptocurrencies or does today’s Bitcoin price pullback signal the start of a deeper correction? Let’s analyze the charts. Bitcoin (BTC) has broken down of the 20-day EMA and can now slide to the 50-day SMA. The failure of the bulls to break out of the downtrend line is a negative sign. It shows a lack of demand at higher levels.If the bears sink the price below $8,467.54, which is a 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the most recent rally, a drop to the $7,702.87 to $7,297.21 support zone is likely. A break below this zone will be a huge negative.Conversely, if the BTC/USD pair bounces off the current levels, the bulls will again attempt to scale above the downtrend line. If successful, the pair is likely to pick up momentum. We will wait for a new buy setup to form before proposing a trade.Ether (ETH) turned down from the overhead resistance of $196.483 on Nov. 6 for the third time. This shows that bulls are defending $196.483 aggressively. If the price slips below $173.841, it can slide to $161.056.Both moving averages are flat and the RSI is close to 50, which suggests a balance between demand and supply.If the ETH/USD pair bounces off the $161.056-$151.829 support zone, it will remain range-bound for a few more days. The pair will pick up momentum above $196.483 while it will turn negative below $151.829. For now, traders can keep the stop loss on the long positions at $150.XRP turned down sharply from the overhead resistance of $0.31491 on Nov. 7. Though the bulls defended the support at the 50-day SMA, they could not sustain the rebound. This shows selling at higher levels.The 20-day EMA has started to turn down and the RSI has dipped into the negative zone. This suggests that bears have the upper hand.If the XRP/USD pair sustains below the 50-day SMA, it could drop to the critical support at $0.24508. A break below this support will be a huge negative. Hence, traders can keep the stop loss on the long position at $0.24.Contrary to our assumption, if the price rebounds off the 50-day EMA, the bulls will again attempt to break out of $0.31491. If successful, a rally to $0.34229 is likely.The bulls are struggling to sustain Bitcoin Cash (BCH) price above the neckline of the head and shoulders pattern. This shows that bears are defending the neckline. The pullback can reach the 20-day EMA, which is likely to offer support.If the price bounces off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will again attempt to push the price to $360. Nonetheless, if the bears sink the price below the 20-day EMA, the BCH/USD pair will turn negative. Hence, traders can trail the stop loss on long positions to breakeven.Litecoin (LTC) broke above $63.3876 on Nov. 5 but the bulls could not build upon the gains. This shows a lack of demand at higher levels. The price has pulled back to the 20-day EMA,  which is gradually sloping up. This suggests that the buyers have the upper hand in the short-term.If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will attempt to extend the recovery and carry the LTC/USD pair to $80.2731. Contrary to our assumption, if the pair dips below the moving averages, it will remain range-bound for a few days. For now, the stop loss on the long positions can be kept at $47. We might suggest closing the position if the price sustains below the moving averages.EOS broke out of the overhead resistance at $3.58 on Nov. 5, which triggered our buy recommendation given in the earlier analysis. However, contrary to our assumption, the bulls could not sustain the momentum and carry the price higher. Profit booking has dragged the price back towards the critical support a $3.37. The 20-day EMA is sloping up and is placed just below $3.37. This indicates that the bulls have the upper hand.If the price bounces off the 20-day EMA, the buyers will attempt to push the price to $4.8719. Our bullish view will be invalidated if the bears sink the price below the 50-day SMA. Therefore, traders can keep the stop loss on the long positions at $2.95.The bulls have not been able to propel Binance Coin (BNB) above $21.2378 for the past few days. This shows that buying dries up at higher levels. If the bulls fail to defend the 20-day EMA, a drop to $18.3 is possible.If the price rebounds off $18.30, the BNB/USD pair could remain range-bound for a few days. The pair will pick up momentum on a breakout and close above $21.2378.However, if the bulls fail to defend $18.30, a drop to $16.50 will be on the cards. If the price re-enters the channel, it will be a huge negative. Hence, traders can continue to retain the stop loss on long positions at $16.Bitcoin SV (BSV) broke out and closed (UTC time) above the downtrend line on Nov. 5, which triggered our buy recommended in the previous analysis. However, contrary to our assumption, the price could not reach $155.38.The altcoin turned down from $143.04. This is a bearish sign as it suggests a lack of buyers at higher levels. The BSV/USD pair has slipped below the most recent low of $124.50, which triggered our stop loss proposed in the previous analysis.If the price bounces off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will again attempt to reach $155.38. However, if bears sustain the price below the 20-day EMA, a deeper correction is likely. Stellar (XLM) rallied close to our first target objective of $0.088708 on Nov. 5 where traders could have booked partial profits on the long positions as suggested in our previous analysis. Profit booking at the resistance has dragged the price to the 20-day EMA, which should have triggered the trailing stop loss.Both moving averages are flattening out and the RSI has dipped to the midpoint. This suggests a range formation in the near term.Our neutral view will be invalidated if the XLM/USD pair rebounds sharply and rises above the overhead resistance of $0.088708. However, we give it a low probability of occurring. Alternatively, if the price slips below the 20-day EMA, a dip to the 50-day SMA is likely. We will wait for a new buy setup to form before recommending a trade in it.Tron (TRX) has been range-bound between $0.01866 and $0.020488 for the past few days. Attempts to breakout or breakdown of this range have failed. This shows a balance between both buyers and sellers. The flat moving averages and the RSI just above the midpoint also suggests a few days of consolidation. The balance will shift in favor of bulls if the TRX/USD pair breaks out and closes above $0.020488. Above this, a move to $0.0234 and above it to $0.030 is likely. On the other hand, if the pair breaks below $0.01866, bears will be at an advantage. The next support on the downside is at the 50-day SMA and below it $0.0136655.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

However, Statistica's Global Consumer Survey for 2019 shows that a fifth Turkish residents are acquainted with crypto and have been exposed to it in some form or another. If the figures are true, 20% is the highest proportion of all the countries in the world. ","Flying under the radar, Turkey has undoubtedly become a crypto giant, and with President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan recently announcing that testing of the digital lira is to be finalized in 2020, crypto is destined to become even more popular.In fact, observing the rapid rise of crypto and blockchain in the country, Cointelgraph has unveiled the Turkish edition of the outlet this year. This article was written in association with their team — and in particular, the editor, Erhan Kahraman.While the country’s government was initially reluctant to embrace cryptocurrencies, the people had always found utility in it. A survey from ING conducted in April 2015 found that 45% of Turkish people believed that digital currencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) were the future of online spending. This constituted the highest percentage for all the European countries surveyed, surpassing the European average of 28% by a wide margin. This higher acceptance of crypto signals that Turkish people more readily use mobile devices for financial activities. The same survey showed that 56% of Turks had used mobile payment apps in contrast with the Eurpoean consumers’ average of 33%. The online payment sector in Turkey had been ready to adopt crypto, but the first opportunity only came when PayPal was banned in the country following the rejection of its license by the Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency. The use of crypto in the country spiked to unprecedented levels to fill the online payment space. Barış Özistek, the chairman of both venture capital fund Boğaziçi Ventures and games publication company Netmarble EMEA, attributed the high adoption of crypto to the advanced gaming market of the country, telling Cointelegraph, “There are more than 30 million active gamers in Turkey. Gaming is a sphere in which virtual equipment and digital currency is used for the first time, and used most commonly.” He went on to add: “Turkish users already knew that virtual materials increase in value when supply and demand are created in the markets, or depending on their popularity, they may decrease in value. That's why Turkish users adopted to cryptocurrencies very fast and easily. Of course, a high percentage of digitally literate people among Turkish users and being informed about trade in our historical past were contributing factors to the situation.”Back in August 2014, Cointelegraph interviewed the founder of QuazarCoin, who goes by the name Orhan, about the state of crypto in Turkey. At the time, the regulatory environment in the country was not ideal, as the nation had banned Twitter amid rising political uncertainty. In that interview, Orhan said Turkey was not the best place to develop crypto, not even Bitcoin itself, as the country did not have any frameworks nor the political stability set up to deal with the technology. He added that: “I think this is the reason why people connected to Bitcoin or alternative cryptocurrencies do not want to show their face or their true name to the general public.” These are some harsh criticisms for a country that would become a global leader in crypto adoption just five years after these words were said. In 2017, the Turkish government made news with another major push back against crypto. The government claimed that Bitcoin was “not compatible” with Islam due to the speculative nature of buying and selling it. However, Ozistek recently told Cointelegraph that he thinks that blockchain and cryptos are pro-Islam, saying, “Instead of being haram, blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies are more in accord with Islamic Finance rules.” He went on to explain:“When it comes to cryptocurrencies, if the project gains value, so does the cryptocurrency. You don't earn money from money. If the project you invested in gains value, the cryptocurrency you hold also gains value; if the project fails, your cryptocurrency loses value. It doesn't include a guaranteed income, such as interest.”Turkey’s political situation for the past decade has been rocky. The relationships with its highly distrurbed neighbors, Iraq and Syria, put the country at the heart of one of the most violent international conflicts in recent memory. Additionally, the country's relationship with global superpowers Russia and the United States hasn’t always been great either.All of these factors came together to make the Turkish lira one of the most volatile national currencies. Volatility wasn’t the only factor that led to the country’s migration toward cryptos. It was the uncertainty associated with the currency, too. Şant Manukyan, the director of international markets at İş Yatırım, told Cointelegraph regarding the issue:“When compared to other countries which include Argentina or countries with collapsed infrastructure such as Venezuela, the situation of Turkey is much more different, and better. Bitcoin is highlighted in these countries as a protection from devaluation and as a way to carry the money abroad. In Turkey, it provides an alternative to investors who use dollar but look for profit; but it's not as common as other countries for sure.”July 2016’s failed coup d’état led to a sharp decline in the lira’s price. The lira sinking in August 2018 marked two years of economic uncertainty. Coupled with poor political relations with the U.S. and an impending debt crisis, high inflation and low interest rates, it was a perfect storm for an already tech-ready country to adopt crypto.The correlation of economically affected countries and high crypto adoption can be seen elsewhere across the global — such as Venezuela, Iran and Zimbabwe — giving credence to the theory of Hyperbitcoinization. Yasin Oral, the CEO and founder of Bitcoin exchange Paribu, told Cointelegraph:“When a country go through an economic crisis it causes the investors to seek new channels and untroubled markets. In addition to this the fluctuating exchange rate gives way to new investment tools. In Turkey, the crypto money and the other digital assets were accepted as a new means of investment thanks to the population that can easily adapt to new technologies. If you pay attention to the local surveys, crypto money owners plan the digital assets as long term investments as well as actively making transactions.”Turkey’s Ministry of Industry and Technology announced plans to establish a national blockchain infrastructure during its Strategy 2023 presentation on Sept. 18 in Ankara. The plan necessitates working with Turkish regulators to assist in creating a regulatory sandbox for blockchain applications. This accompanied several blockchain technology implementations, like the Istanbul Blockchain and Innovation Center, known as BlockchainIST Center. Talking about the country’s policymakers jumping on the crypto bandwagon early, Ozgur Guneri, the CEO of the BTCTurk exchange, told Cointelegraph that he believes Turkish policymakers are keen to see what blockchain and crypto can bring to the table, adding that:“The latest major policy decisions were Turkish Central Bank’s aim to launch a crypto currency and Financial Crimes Investigation Board’s decision to loosen its strict stand towards cryptocurrencies. I believe that major motivation behind Turkey’s interest in cryptocurrencies and blockchain is its revolutionary technology and all the potential disruption they may bring to the economy.”Turkey has a vision of making Istanbul a financial center, and all institutions are working toward that end. Talking about the hard path to make Turkey a global financial hub, Özistek said it will not be an easy task to take that status away from the United Kingdom and Switzerland:“By making necessary investments in cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, and creating infrastructure and legal regulations, Turkey may surpass its strong rivals just as a technology entrepreneur.

been challenging investors and their holding powers. Despite BTC ...","Nov 23, 2019","What’s an effective way to diversify a crypto portfolio? Are crypto assets able to be diversified at all? These are the questions that many “Hodlers” have been asking. The slow bleed of Bitcoin (BTC) and other major cryptocurrencies prices has been challenging investors and their holding powers. Despite BTC still able to maintain its 112% year-to-date gains so far — thanks to the massive bull run in the second quarter and the recent China-inspired rally — the recent price correction could pressure some of the latecomers. In this article, we will study some possible diversification options for crypto portfolios from a Hodler’s perspective — i.e., diversifying investment by allocating capital into various crypto assets using long-only strategies. We will also explore how altcoins and stablecoins could balance a portfolio.","In the traditional world of finance, the performance of different assets could vary under different market conditions. For example, real estate investment trusts could outperform general equities in a turbulence market, and defensive stocks could disappoint investors when the appetite for risk is heightened. That’s when diversification comes in. The main purpose of exposure to different asset classes is to balance risk and return in a portfolio.In the cryptocurrency space, diversification could also be one of the ways to manage risk exposure. However, some would argue that it is impossible to diversify a crypto portfolio due to the fact that major altcoins are highly correlated with Bitcoin. However, with a carefully selected basket of altcoins — in conjunction with stablecoins — investors could able to navigate the market more effectively with manageable risk.There has always been a debate about putting all your eggs in one basket. While in some cases concentrating on only one asset could maximize profitability, this also maximizes the risk exposure. On top of that, a heavy-concentration strategy gives investors no room for any errors in analysis, and it overexposes the investor to unnecessary risks.However, over-diversification could also hurt investment returns. Some investors believe that the more assets they own, the better return they can have — and that’s not the right concept. It could increase investment cost, add unnecessary due-diligence efforts and lead to below-average risk-adjusted returns.Before getting into portfolio diversification, let’s have a quick recap on the performance of major cryptocurrencies. The figure below shows that OKB and BTC were among some of the YTD gainers, while XMR and XRP have been underperforming compared to their peers. Once again, this shows various crypto assets could perform very differently, highlighting the importance of balancing risk and return.A portfolio with a balanced selection of coins and tokens could help Hodlers balance risk and returns. Here are some sample portfolios using BTC alongside other leading altcoins as well as the Fundstrat Crypto 40 Index — a weighted index tracks the top 11 to 50 cryptocurrencies by market value and liquidity. The results could make Hodlers think again about putting all their eggs in one basket.Many BTC-based portfolios have remained solidly in the green, due in part to Bitcoin holding on to its 112% gain so far this year. As shown above, however, the portfolio containing only BTC and Ether (ETH) has been underperformed compared to portfolios that have both BTC and exposure to mid-cap altcoins. To see this, compare the 50/50 portfolio (with a yearly gain of 67%) to the one consisting of Bitcoin and the top-40 index (gaining 77% on the year).Meanwhile, the hedging nature of stablecoins like Tether (USDT) has been reflected in the sample portfolio based on BTC and the index with a hedge (76%). In this diversification example, the exposure to altcoins is reduced, the BTC holdings are slightly increased and USDT was added. Still, the gain of this portfolio was very close to the one without USDT. In general, a portfolio that includes stablecoins can reduce the risk ratio more than one that is unhedged, but as the examples above show, it is still possible to achieve similar results.Stablecoins are especially important in portfolios that include highly volatile coins and tokens, as can be seen in the example of the hedged basket. The group comprises XLM and OKB, which have plummeted over 46% and surged over 290% respectively. Still, this combination was able to achieve almost 80% YTD gains, and the USDT holdings were part of the reason behind that performance. In contrast, the mixture of BTC and certain altcoins without a stablecoin in the basket could underperform the other sample portfolios provided.Additionally, experienced traders and Hodlers are able to fine-tune their portfolios by adding derivatives on top of a long-only portfolio. For example, if a Hodler is being short-term bullish on an individual coin, he can increase his leverage on that specific coin by adding futures or perpetual swap positions on top of the holdings. Structured products can also be used as a hedge in a downturning market.Related: How to Trade Big Crypto Volumes, ExplainedCrypto asset diversification has been one of the most debated topics in the industry. Some would argue that a 100% Bitcoin allocation setup could probably still able to generate a decent return this year. However, a BTC-only portfolio will never able to capture the distinctive opportunities in the altcoin world, which could potentially generate higher returns — and, of course, putting all your eggs in one basket comes with higher risk. A carefully designed portfolio with balanced asset allocation could maximize the risk-adjusted return. As the year-end approaches, investors and Hodlers can review their risk profiles and adjust their strategies for next year.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

filed a registration statement on Form 10 for its publicly traded Bitcoin 
( ...","Nov 21, 2019",Grayscale’s Michael Sonnenshein contends that the asset manager’s recent Form 10 filing with American regulators would be “a milestone” for the crypto industry if it’s approved.,"Sonnenshein — managing director at the world’s largest digital asset manager, Grayscale Investments — made his remarks during an interview with CNBC on Nov. 20.Earlier this week, Grayscale filed a registration statement on Form 10 for its publicly traded Bitcoin (BTC) fund Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).If approved, the trust would become the first cryptocurrency investment vehicle to attain the status of a reporting company by the SEC. In his interview with CNBC, Sonnenshein noted the robust institutional interest in cryptocurrency access products. Even just in Q3 2019, he said:“84% of inflows were from non-crypto hedge funds that want digital asset exposure.”GBTC has been trading since May 2015 and Sonnenshein noted that “if we just look at the last 3-month trading volume, it’s tripled year-over-year,” regardless of Bitcoin’s performance on the spot markets.Regarding the significance of the SEC potentially giving the green light to Grayscale’s Form 10 filing, Sonnenshein said:“You have a lot of companies that want to have exposure to the space, but then you start to ask, who at the company is going to have the keys? Who at the company is going to do the due diligence and the ongoing compliance?”Aside from compliance benefits, he emphasized the importance of creating a family of products that “look and feel like many of the other instruments these institutions use.”The takeaway, he suggested, is that if Form 10 is deemed to be effective, we’ll see for the first time “greater access for institutions who need an SEC reporting company to be able to invest” and “quicker liquidity options, so that investors can divulge their holdings after six, as opposed to twelve, months.”Regarding any potential impact on Bitcoin’s price, Sonnenshein discarded the institutional investor adoption narrative and emphasized instead Bitcoin’s forthcoming halving — and consequent diminishment of supply — as a factor that has historically shown itself to have a positive impact on the asset’s price.As reported, Grayscale’s regulatory foray follows a record year for the trust, which saw inflows of $254 million in total investment into its products in the third quarter of 2019."

87,https://cointelegraph.com,"Nov 18, 2019",How Crypto and Blockchain Are Influencing Geopolitics,https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-crypto-and-blockchain-are-influencing-geopolitics,"With the U.S. and China at ends, India clamping down on Bitcoin, and the 
U.K. pursuing Brexit, how will the crypto market influence geopolitics?","Nov 18, 2019",,"The world is a constantly changing place — and from an economic standpoint, things are dramatically shifting, too. Two major superpowers, the United States and China, are embroiled in a dramatic trade war where tit-for-tat tariffs have been placed on goods — breeding uncertainty for consumers and businesses alike and making everyday products more expensive. The United Kingdom is still embroiled in a messy divorce from the European Union, and Russia is ratcheting up tensions with its neighbors in the West.All of this geopolitical drama has two effects. Firstly, it can wreak havoc on the markets, wiping billions of dollars off the value of major companies and affecting employment rates in the world’s economies. Secondly, it is prompting some enthusiasts to passionately advocate for crypto and blockchain taking a bigger role in the economy. They say it could help bring down borders, making international payments faster and less expensive, while encouraging trade between nations.That said, crypto and blockchain are also creating new geopolitical challenges. North Korea has faced allegations that a sophisticated group of hackers are launching cyberattacks on major exchanges in neighboring South Korea and other parts of Asia. Millions of dollars have been lost, with each incident shaking consumer confidence to its core. India has also been resolute in its decision to push ahead with a crypto ban. This could have ramifications for the likes of Facebook, which is hoping to launch a stablecoin that would benefit the unbanked. The Libra project is also creating tensions around the world, with many countries — the U.S. and the EU among them — concerned that the cryptocurrency could undermine traditional payment infrastructure and overtake the dollar and the euro.A major thing that’s holding cryptocurrency back is the disjointed, fragmented approach to regulation around the world. While some countries like India are taking a hardline approach by proposing jail terms for anyone found handling these coins and tokens, the likes of Japan and Canada have been far more laidback — encouraging innovation, enabling taxes to be paid using Bitcoin, and creating so-called “regulatory sandboxes” where new crypto products can be tested on a small portion of the population before being rolled out.There is a real and pressing divide when it comes to the attitudes surrounding crypto and blockchain. In some countries, there is incredible caution surrounding this technology amid fears it could have a detrimental impact on vulnerable consumers. That said, there are politicians out there who are appalled by the negative attitude that’s being espoused towards the industry — people who believe in its potential and believe their country should be at the forefront of innovation.In part, this desire for a pro-crypto stance lies in fears that certain countries may be getting a headstart on developing their own central bank digital currency, establishing early dominance. One such country is China — which is already set to embark on a rapid acceleration of blockchain usage at the behest of President Xi Jinping.Reading the tea leaves to figure out what the future holds for crypto and blockchain is a challenge. Will China achieve dominance and launch a central bank digital currency? Will India be successful in its quest to ban cryptocurrency? Will Russia succeed in its quest to enable law enforcement to confiscate Bitcoin, and is this even possible?With so many unknowns, conferences have gained popularity as a way of hearing valuable insights from some of the best-known practitioners in the crypto and blockchain industries. One of them is the Crypto Finance Conference, which is taking place from Jan. 15 to 17 in St. Moritz, Switzerland.Organizers of the conference say that they are determined to cater each session to the individual needs of attendees. To that end, some of the event’s main speakers are going to be taking time to answer questions both onstage and offstage. Extensive networking opportunities are also on offer, giving delegates the chance to delve into areas of particular interest and establish meaningful contacts.The program is still under development — but already, there are a series of sessions that will interest those who are keeping a close eye on geopolitical developments in the industry. The first day will explore the global impact of crypto and blockchain, and offer predictions for the future. There’s little doubt that the talk on the evolution of central banking will explore the attitudes that countries worldwide are adopting when it comes to everything from Bitcoin to Libra. Tales from the global regulatory frontline are also going to be shared.With crypto and blockchain constantly hitting the headlines and battles being fought on many fronts, there’s going to be plenty to discuss as business visionaries descend on one of Switzerland’s finest resort towns.Disclaimer.

Trezor officials soon clarified that they had nothing to do with the stunt, and that the company had no official resellers in the country.The event seemed to accurately portray the precarious situation of cryptocurrencies in Venezuela. They are widely popular, given the hyperinflation and overall failing state of the local economy, but are mostly traded underground via peer-to-peer services. Meanwhile, Maduro’s government is mostly focused on Petro — the controversial, state-controlled cryptocurrency tasked with saving the Venezuelan economy. So, what has Maduro’s apparent obsession with cryptocurrencies resulted in so far besides an underdeveloped pet project? Maduro was elected president in April 2013, following Hugo Chávez’s death, in a narrow win over opposition candidate Henrique Capriles. Maduro’s administration instantly faced a number of major economic problems left over from Chávez’s policies, namely high inflation rates and large shortages of basic necessities. The new president continued the policial course of his predecessor, who largely relied on oil-fueled welfare policies to maintain economic stability. However, the price of oil — which reportedly account for 99% of Venezuela’s export earnings — started to tumble under Maduro’s administration, bringing the country to the verge of a major humanitarian catastrophe. Thus, the inflation rate has been on the rise ever since Maduro was elected president. In 2018, it was at 1,698,488%. According to the International Monetary Fund, Venezuela’s hyperinflation rate increased to as much as 10,000,000% at some point this year.Needless to say, these numbers have real implications: In 2017, 87% of people in Venezuela were living in poverty, rising from 82% in 2016 and 48% in 2014, according to an academic study. Hunger is also a major problem, with Venezuelans losing about 24 lbs on average in 2017 due to nationwide food shortages.The president has blamed capitalism for the ongoing problems. For instance, Maduro argued that an imperialist “electromagnetic attack” caused the largest power outage in the country’s history, which occurred in March 2019. According to opposition leader Juan Guaidó, it was actually “the product of the inefficiency, the incapability, the corruption of a regime that doesn’t care about the lives of Venezuelans.”Related: Venezuelan Petro Against US Sanctions: History and Use of the CryptoIn December 2017, Maduro took to national TV to present a potential fix for the many economic difficulties — a state-run digital currency called Petro. The cryptocurrency would be backed by the country’s oil, gold and mineral reserves, the president said. Ironically, Maduro’s administration had been anti-crypto up until that point. Earlier in 2017, reports emerged that the government had begun cracking down on mining operations. Indeed, cryptocurrency mining was and still remains a popular activity in Venezuela, as it allows locals to capitalize on cheap electricity prices.“In Venezuela, the most popular currency is Bitcoin,” according to Venezuela-based cryptocurrency consultant and Cointelegraph en Español contributor Jhonnatan Morales, who added that, “Many people are mining and trading Bitcoin not to acquire products, but to protect themselves from hyperinflation.”Maduro’s Petro was designed to dodge United States sanctions that supposedly hinder the local economy. As the Venezuelian leader himself put it, the cryptocurrency aims to fight the financial “blockade” erected by the U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration. In response, Trump restricted American investors from participating in the initial coin offering for Petro, which launched on Feb. 20, 2018. Morales told Cointelegraph:“Although the government has the help of Russia for many of its international operations, the use of cryptocurrency to liquidate or transfer capital is important for the government since cash is usually impractical for international contracts.”In March 2018, a month into the ICO, Maduro claimed that a total of $5 billion was raised during Petro’s presale — which would make it one of the largest ICOs to date, eclipsing the $2 billion TON token private offering led by Telegram and the $4.2 billion token sale of EOS. However, as Steve Hanke, an applied economist at Johns Hopkins University, has pointed out, those claims “aren’t believable” because they have yet to be verified by an independent audit.Petro was officially launched in November 2018, following a series of delays. The release was not problem-free, either. Soon after the white paper was published, crypto enthusiasts found out that Petro largely plagiarized its documentation from Dash (DASH), one of the most popular cryptocurrencies in the country. As Jorge Farias, CEO of Cryptobuyer — a Panama-headquartered exchange platform run by a team of Venezuleans — told Cointelegraph, Petro is technically a Dash fork, albeit a permissioned one: “Petro has gone through different stages, from a totally failed one, to one where there is a blockchain that although it is private and not auditable at least it has a block explorer. It is an X11 fork that is the same one used by DASH.”Maduro seems determined to integrate Petro into the local economy, even though its utility seems questionable. For instance, he has announced the launch of a Petro-funded crypto bank to support youth and student initiatives, and Venezuelan Minister of Habitat and Housing Ildemaro Villarroel declared that Petro will be used to fund the construction of houses for the homeless. Maduro has also publicly called on workers to save in gold and Petro during a salary shake-up.In December 2018, the government went as far as to automatically convert pensioners’ monthly bonus into Petro, despite the fact that the cryptocurrency was not widely accepted in the country, according to reports. Around the same time, Maduro claimed that his government will use Petro to sell oil and hence minimize U.S. dominance on the global market. Country-wide adoption could be nearing for Petro at last, although under compulsion. In August this year, Maduro ordered the country’s leading bank, Banco de Venezuela, to accept the nation’s cryptocurrency at all of its branches. In September, when the bank provided its clients with online wallets catering to Petro, the people of Venezuela set a new record for trading cryptocurrencies — only they weren’t trading Petro. From Sept. 1 to Sept. 7, Venezuelans traded more than 120 billion bolivars (roughly around $4 million) for Bitcoin on P2P exchange LocalBitcoins, showing that demand for decentralized cryptocurrencies has not diminished with the state-run asset’s arrival. A representative for the charity-focused organization Bitcoin Venezuela told Cointelegraph that indeed, most cryptocurrency trading is done via P2P services:“Bitcoin is popular as it used to be used as a way to send remittances from outside the country through LocalBitcoins, Hodl Hodl, Paxful, because it is very liquid and there are thousands of people willing to buy your BTC right away for Bolivars (VES) in a bank account, the local currency, or Dollars in a US bank or USD cash.”The spokesperson also confirmed that there are no large exchanges based in the country, only a “BTC/VES brokerage service” and seven exchanges that have been approved by officials to operate in the country. These platforms seem to be mostly focused on Petro, as they have BTC/PTR and PTR/VES trading pairs listed on their websites. Cointelegraph reached out to most of the approved exchanges — Cryptolago, Coincave, Bancar, Ambers Coin and Cryptia — but none have replied. Nevertheless, Petro might still become widely accepted in Venezuela at some point in the future. According to Farias of Cryptobuyer, “They talk about more than 900 businesses already accepting it as a form of payment and the obligation to keep double accounting for private and public companies.” This may suggest that the bolivar may soon be eliminated and thus set a precedent for the rest of the world. Farias added: “Many businessmen and companies have shown some interest as long as it can be converted into some other crypto or FIAT, but it is necessary to wait for the mechanisms and regulations that will govern these processes to draw some conclusion.”It seems that Maduro has appropriated cryptocurrencies for his own means — and Petro allows the Venezuelian leader to weed decentralized cryptocurrencies out from that agenda. Indeed, the state needs a currency that it can control. Morales told Cointelegraph:“Almost 30% of all retail operations in Venezuela are made through the dollar. This does not allow the Venezuelan government to collect taxes since they have no way to access the account in dollars where Venezuelans deposit their taxes.”According to Javier Bastardo, a local cryptocurrency enthusiast and Cointelegraph en Español journalist, Maduro’s knowledge of the technology behind cryptocurrencies seems limited, although that doesn’t stop him from aggressively promoting Petro:“He talks about the ‘technological revolution,’ ‘new relations,’ but this is just rhetoric. Obviously he only shills his own project and tends to not mention Bitcoin.”In August, Trump’s administration froze all Venezuelan government assets, further escalating the tense U.S.–Venezuelan relations and prompting Maduro to work on alternative financial options like Petro. Perhaps that — along with other developments like the study suggesting that Venezuela is now more than 50% dollarized — was what caused Maduro to attend the technological fair last week. As Farias explained to Cointelegraph, the fair was a private event launched by Banco de Venezuela, where various companies showcased solutions “based in one way or another on cryptocurrencies.”One of the attending firms was Trezorvenezuela, a local company that is not directly affiliated with Trezor but sells its products locally. Maduro approached the company’s stall on live television, which resulted in the president of Venezuela de facto endorsing a cryptocurrency wallet developed by a nonlocal company without its consent. “Trezor and Satoshilabs do not have any official representatives in Venezuela, nor do we have any active authorized resellers in this region,” the official statement that soon followed from the hardware wallet firm read. It continued:“We’re in no way associated with those people claiming to be official representatives of Trezor, and do not endorse or permit their use of our brand. We are carefully investigating this copyright infringement.”The statement then added that the individuals were at one time Trezor resellers from the third quarter of 2018 but were removed from the list in June 2019 due to inactivity. In an additional comment to Cointelegraph, the Trezor representative added that they are “in contact with Trezorvenezuela and are continuing our investigations to decide what steps to take next.”A spokesperson for Trezorvenezuela, in turn, explained to Cointelegraph that they “saw nothing wrong with participating,” elaborating:“Our company was at the event, as in the others, as it supports the cryptocurrency ecosystem in general, without politicizing them, our vision and commitment is with the ecosystem and demonstrate that cryptocurrencies are real solutions to multiple problems. Even for the people of Venezuela, which gives them freedom to manage their funds and protect themselves from the hyperinflation that our country is home to.” The Trezorvenezuela representative added that Maduro’s team did not contact them after the fair."

Between 50–100 of the exchange’s employees reportedly worked out of the Shanghai location.Binance has not responded to Cointelegraph’s requests for comment as of press time. The purported raid follows a crackdown on cryptocurrency-related businesses and activities in the country. Recently, financial authorities in China issued a notice to the public, directing individuals to report businesses engaged in virtual asset trading to the Shanghai headquarters of the People's Bank of China — the country’s central bank. Activities that must be reported include:“Virtual currency transactions in the territory; the other is to issue ‘xx coins’ and ‘xx’ in the form of ‘blockchain application scenarios.’  Currency, fundraising or bitcoin, virtual currency such as Ethereum; third, providing services such as publicity, diversion, agency trading, etc. for registered ICO projects, virtual currency trading platforms, etc.” Notice from authorities on cryptocurrency-related activities.

contribution.” #London #Bitcoin Regulation #United Kingdom # ...","Nov 22, 2019","London has long been one of the world’s most prominent financial hubs. But as the United Kingdom delves further into an uncertain period of political instability that could radically alter the very identity of the country, its attractiveness for business is starting to be questioned.","Despite the need to appear as business-friendly and open to innovation as possible due to the ramifications of the ongoing Brexit crisis, the U.K. still lacks a concrete framework for the regulation of cryptocurrency. However, in mid-November, the United Kingdom Jurisdiction Taskforce of the LawTech Delivery Panel published a statement exploring the legal status of cryptocurrencies, blockchain and smart contracts under English and Welsh private law. The Brexit crisis has tarnished the reputation of the U.K. — a country that was once famed for its strong economy and pro-business approach has come to be known for division and stagnation. For three years, the country has remained in stasis as other, more forward-thinking nations fill the void left behind. Despite many prominent crypto-related companies basing themselves in the U.K., the country yet lacks any concrete crypto regulation compared to some of its Asian and European counterparts.Taking a step out of the still waters, the Tech Nation and LawTech Delivery panel report seeks to lay the foundation for a robust regulatory framework for blockchain, cryptocurrency and smart contracts. Most notably, the legal statement outlines crypto assets as tradeable property and smart contracts as enforceable agreements under local law. Although the publication of the report is an indicator that progress is being made behind the scenes in the U.K. regarding crypto regulation, it does not represent direct action or explicit support from the government itself. Nevertheless, the LawTech Delivery Panel members include industry experts and U.K. government figures, as well as members from the judiciary space — all seeking to develop the burgeoning crypto sector within the country.The report begins with a bold statement from the chancellor to the High Court and chair of the U.K. Jurisdiction Taskforce, Geoffrey Vos, about the potential of cryptocurrencies and smart contracts: “In legal terms, cryptoassets and smart contracts undoubtedly represent the future. I hope that the Legal Statement will go a long way towards providing much needed market confidence, legal certainty and predictability in areas that are of great importance to the technological and legal communities and to the global financial services industry.”Vos speculated that the report, while not setting out the specific details for crypto regulation itself, would play an important role in future attempts to do so, and “provide a foundation for the responsible future utilisation of cryptoassets and smart contracts.”A spokesperson for CryptoUK, the U.K.’s self-regulatory trade association representing the crypto asset sector, gave a statement to Cointelegraph regarding the LawTech Delivery Panel’s publication: “The LawTech Delivery Panel’s legal statement on cryptoassets is welcome because it brings a degree of greater clarity to the legal standing of cryptoassets in English law.”The report also celebrates the potential for blockchain and smart contracts. As observed by LawTech Delivery Panel director Jennifer Swallow, the global smart contract market is expected to reach $300 million by 2023. The same publication states that the World Economic Forum predicts one-tenth of global GDP will be stored on blockchains by 2027. Consequently, Swallow outlined her belief that regulating these technologies is vitally important, “It is great to see the adaptability of our common law system to fast-changing technology, demonstrated in this landmark legal statement from the UKJT.”While any statements on the regulation of cryptocurrency are welcome, readers of the report will note that the taskforce has been clear that it is not recommending a comprehensive account of all legal details regarding the technology: “Its purpose is to answer the questions we were asked and to state briefly our reasons in a form accessible to non-lawyers as well as lawyers.”Investors seeking a definitive step toward cryptocurrency’s ultimate goal of replacing mainstream finance will be disappointed by the absence of discussion about cryptocurrency as money: “The Taskforce considers that matters of taxation, criminal law, partnership law, data protection, intellectual property, consumer protection, settlement finality, regulatory capital, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing are best dealt with by other bodies or organisations. We have not trespassed into issues relating to monetary policy or the nature of cryptoassets as money”As might be expected in the cut-throat business environment of the U.K., information that could give businesses the edge they need to succeed are awaited with bated breath. While the report is unlikely to create waves in the U.K. crypto world on its own, several figures from the industry spoke to Cointelegraph about what prospects it could have for further development. Related: UK Crypto Regulation Is Changing, Recognition Looming at Long LastPiers Ridyard, CEO of the Radix decentralized ledger, told Cointelegraph that U.K. authorities are actually relatively open to crypto innovation and that their cooperation with the writers of this report should be noted: “The FCA has been progressive on its views on crypto for years; including monitoring and permitting trials of the technology in sandbox environments before regulatory licenses are needed. The UK generally sees itself as a Fintech leader, and the FCA sees part of its job as not getting in the way of innovation. This report was written with direct input from members of the FCA, and is overall a good indication of the direction the UK wants to head.”However, the regulatory compliance team of London-based cryptocurrency exchange CEX.IO explained in a private correspondence with Cointelegraph that as the report is published by an independent, non-governmental body, the impact is not likely to be immediate, but it could play an important role in regulatory decisions made further down the line:“We can speak only about indirect influence, since the Lawtech Delivery Panel is a consultative rather than a regulatory or legislative body. However, it has significant influence deriving from industry and government support. Given this influence, the considerations and conclusions of the panel may be used by lawmakers, regulators, and courts as the baseline and grounded rationale for further decisions.”Sukhi Jutla, co-founder of blockchain-based gold and jewelry platform Market Orders, told Cointelegraph that what the report lacks in immediate ability to bring about legal change, it makes up for in demonstrating the interest that relevant authorities are paying to cryptocurrency, adding: “This should hopefully encourage more conversations to be had around how these assets should be governed and regulated in a way that fosters innovation and development in the blockchain and crypto community.”The U.K.’s legal system is one of the most reputable in the world. Combined with the country’s long and well-established financial history, this makes it a strong candidate when choosing a country in which to set up a business. For some crypto entrepreneurs, U.K. law is also better suited for the regulation of crypto than the legal systems of other countries, as stated in the LawTech Delivery Panel report. The compliance team of CEX.IO told Cointelegraph that the U.K. common law system is more adaptable than its European counterparts, “Compared to continental law, sometimes you do not need to go through the time-consuming and complicated legislative process, but rather can rely on the determination of the court.”Radix CEO Piers Ridyard told Cointelegraph that the U.K.’s legal system has a competitive edge when it comes to fintech, citing its flexibility for innovation in the market:“Its case law based approach to rule enforcement in court is also very flexible for quickly adapting to new changes in market when the letter of the law can be sometimes unclear.”Having founded a blockchain-based business in the UK, Market Orders’ Sukhi Jutla explained to Cointelegraph that while the U.K. is a good place for fintech companies to launch, more work needs to be done in order to iron out the legal gray areas: “For the UK to emerge as the best place to create a crypto-related company, business owners need greater clarity and support from the government and financial bodies to feel assured that their innovations won’t get them penalised or fined.”Although some more radical crypto enthusiasts are itching to see the mainstream financial superstructure crumble and fall, many involved in crypto-related business in the U.K. want to see it develop into a system capable of more forward-looking practices. Despite the sluggish government action on cryptocurrency, several crypto businesses told Cointelegraph that along with the legal statement’s publishing, they see positive developments occurring in the U.K. According to the CEX.IO team, London still wears the financial crown, and cryptocurrency adoption will pave the way for the city to keep its prestigious status: “First of all, the UK was, is, and will be the leading financial center of the world. We believe that crypto assets and underlying technology bring dramatic changes to the architecture of the financial world, and the UK, whether we are talking about the City of London, Canary Wharf, or elsewhere, is in the best position to keep their high status, providing an attractive environment and creating a fertile ecosystem for future development.”Radix’s Ridyard told Cointelegraph that while the U.K. enjoys a strong reputation based on its history of being pro-business, it is slipping down the rankings and Brexit brings with it further uncertainty:“The UK ranks number 8 on the world’s ranking of ease of doing business, and has one of the most mature financial regulatory frameworks in the world. With the advent of Brexit, it is likely to continue to fight hard for making itself as attractive as possible as a jurisdiction crypto related companies as this is the future of finance.”While the statement might not be the groundbreaking legal framework many are eagerly anticipating, it is nonetheless a demonstration that progress is being made in terms of cryptocurrency regulation. The U.K. legal framework is thorough and change can, and often does, take time. A CryptoUK spokesperson told Cointelegraph that while the legal statement is a positive development, it is not a substitute for comprehensive legal action: “That’s why we’re calling for the regulation of cryptoassets in the UK, to provide greater certainty and adequately protect consumers. We are actively working alongside regulators and the Government to help deliver a proportionate and well-designed UK regulatory regime which matches the best of other jurisdictions across the world.”Similarly, CEX.IO’s compliance team believes that there is great appetite for crypto regulation in the U.K., despite there having been a number of rules already put in place: “The specific crypto-focused legislation should also clarify relations with financial institutions, that will stimulate the markets growth.” However, the exchange believes that there is still a long way to go before the regulatory environment in the U.K. can be considered up to scratch: “The Cryptoassets Taskforce — consisting of the HM Treasury, the Bank of England, and the FCA — did a great job back in 2018, and it was later incremented by the FCA when they issued their Policy Statement on Cryptoassets in July this year. But there is much more work to be done, and this statement is a significant contribution.”"

Co-branded with Mastercard and UnionPay, card owners can top up using a plethora of digital currencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin. Crypto is automatically converted into cash, giving the user freedom to make withdrawals at cash machines and make purchases at any point of sale terminal. The company adds it is focused on supplying business-to-business solutions to customers worldwide.The team says extensive tests have been performed to ensure that its infrastructure is working correctly. One recent experiment saw 1 BTC (worth about $8,500 at the time of writing) loaded onto the card. Footage posted on YouTube appeared to show that the funds had successfully arrived and were available to spend in Singapore dollars. Other videos have shown the card working successfully in fast-food restaurants, and being used to purchase mobile phone data online.Embily’s founder, Alexander Bychkov, has said that one of his main motivations is ensuring that digital currencies such as Bitcoin can be used easily in everyday life. Some payment processing providers do allow merchants to accept crypto at the checkout, but this can be inconvenient for consumers who have to do plenty of research to track down these places. By offering instantaneous conversions and integrating into existing payment infrastructure, Bychkov hopes to remove this friction.The company also argues that far fewer people are using Bitcoin to buy goods and services than most crypto enthusiasts believe. Despite the fact that there are more than 7.7 billion people living on Earth according to the most current estimates, a recent study by the analytics firm Chainalysis found that just 1.3% of transactions came from merchants between January and April 2019.Embily hopes to help build these circulation figures higher — emboldening crypto enthusiasts to buy dinner, pay for their parking and purchase in-game extras with ease. Its infrastructure is being offered on a white-label basis, meaning that the underlying technology can be used by crypto businesses that want to expand their reach and make life more convenient for their user base. Wallets and exchanges are listed among the types of platforms who could benefit.Over time, this could help cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin make the transition from being regarded as a store of value to a means of exchange. It could also help demystify coins and tokens in the eyes of the public, who often regard digital currencies as complicated and high-risk. If the process of topping up and spending crypto is as simple as making a deposit in a bank, it could remove a barrier to entry that has been holding millions of people back — and even help regulators, including those who believe that BTC and ETH aren’t real currencies, begin to appreciate their value and place in society.Embily began life in Dubai back in June 2017, and another office in Bangkok was opened three months later. From late 2018 the company open its headquarters in Singapore and now operates there. The team includes finance professionals, experienced digital marketers and veteran developers. With staff from around the world and a diverse range of backgrounds, the company says it is international in outlook and determined to give clients the best service possible.Bychkov has recently shared his insights into Embily at a number of conferences, including Crypto Expo Singapore back in October and BlockShow Asia in November.Disclaimer.

Can I use it yet?” It featured representatives of several stablecoin companies, along with Chia Hock Lai, president of the Singapore FinTech Association. “Tether is controversial because it’s the king of stablecoins,” he summarized, wearing a Tether T-shirt. “So it’s no surprise that everyone is trying to come at the king.” Continuing, Mow noted but dismissed the public struggles USDT’s issuer is facing, including a United States lawsuit:  “Daily trading volume is $20 billion per day — 100 times larger than the next biggest stablecoin. So we see stupid things like theories about one whale manipulating Bitcoin price — billion-dollar lawsuits etc.” Nonetheless, for all its success, Tether is unlikely to find a home among everyone consumers, as its utility lies elsewhere.“I don’t think stablecoins will be adopted in retail use cases. They’re used mainly for traders to take advantage of arbitrage opportunities,” Mow added.The panel also discussed the impact of national digital currencies issued by central banks on stablecoins, as well as Facebook’s Libra. Going forward, Mow said he envisaged no threat from Bitcoin (BTC), but national digital currencies such as China’s could disrupt stablecoins’ use case. “Stablecoins are a mid-step toward hyperbitcoinization. They’re a temporary thing. The main threat they face is from the national cryptocurrencies. How open will those national cryptocurrencies be? …But stablecoins will then have no reason to exist with a national cryptocurrency,” he continued.He additionally foresees more USDT — and other stablecoins — migrating from the Ethereum network to Blockstream’s Liquid sidechain to avoid well-known congestion issues. Mow added that Japanese yen, Canadian dollar and Australian dollar stablecoins are currently being developed to launch on the Liquid network in the near future. As for Libra, he said, it is already too late:“I think Libra is doomed.”"

security, potentially signifying a trend for more transparency.","Nov 23, 2019","On Nov. 19, Grayscale Investments, a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group and the world's largest digital asset manager, filed a voluntary registration statement on Form 10 with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on behalf of its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust.","If successful, the move would result in the trust acquiring the status of an SEC reporting company, the first cryptocurrency investment instrument to do so. The trust’s shares would therefore be registered according to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.Grayscale Investments expects the development to broaden the product’s investor base and provide those already holding the trust’s shares better transparency and liquidity. However, the digital asset management company also emphasized that it is seeking neither an exchange-traded fund status nor listing on a national securities exchange.So, what would the regulator’s approval of the form mean for Grayscale Bitcoin Trust and the wider crypto industry?An investment trust is a company that owns a fixed amount of a certain asset and issues contracts representing shares of its ownership. Investors who own the shares also pay fees to the company that manages the trust. Each share of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust currently represents a little less than 0.001 BTC, with an annual fee of 2%. The share of ownership by a contract slowly decreases over time. Overall, the trust holds some 175,000 Bitcoins.Launched in September 2013 and trading since May 2015, Grayscale markets GBTC as a “traditional investment vehicle” whose structure is familiar to financial and tax advisors. Although the firm consistently emphasizes that the product is not an exchange-traded fund, GBTC is modelled similarly to many popular commodity-based ETFs. The shares are eligible to be traded through brokerages and can be held in tax-advantaged accounts, such as individual retirement accounts or 401(k)s.Related: The SEC Does Not Want Crypto ETFs — What Will It Take to Get Approval?Grayscale Bitcoin Trust shares are publicly traded on the over-the counter market OTCQX. In contrast with exchanges, such decentralized marketplaces normally host stocks of smaller companies and enforce less stringent reporting requirements.GBTC is currently listed under the Alternative Reporting Standard, which does not require registration with the SEC. An investment in OTC securities is generally considered riskier than in those traded on exchanges.While this solution facilitates Bitcoin exposure for accredited investors, the present reporting standard might be insufficient for many funds that are potentially interested in digital assets but wary of the lack of transparency. Others may simply have formal limitations on dealing with securities that do not have an SEC registration. Among other GBTC downsides that could be inhibiting investors’ enthusiasm are annual fee and a high premium.Despite these limitations, the trust’s performance has been very solid this year. For one, in less than six months — between February and June — it recorded a spike of more than 300%, outperforming even Bitcoin itself, which had a 223% growth over the same period, due to increased premiums. In a recent interview with CNBC, Michael Sonnenshein, Grayscale’s managing director, touted the year-over-year tripling of last three-month GBTC trading volume.Sonnenshein also noted that the Grayscale Investment’s Bitcoin product is seeing impressive demand from institutional investors seeking digital asset exposure, with 84% of inflows in the third quarter of 2019 coming from noncrypto hedge funds.Also known as the General Form for Registration of Securities, SEC’s Form 10 is a filing designed to provide investors with all the relevant information they may need to make an investment decision.The Exchange Act requires companies with more than $10 million in assets and 750 or more shareholders to file a registration statement on Form 10, while those below these thresholds can do it voluntarily. A Form 10 registration is one of the requirements for registering securities to be traded on U.S. exchanges. Another is the approval by Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.A registration statement is deemed effective 60 days after filing, although the SEC might have additional questions or comments. Once it is in effect, the registration triggers a set of reporting requirements, including annual, quarterly and current reports; annual proxy statements; and beneficial ownership reporting for management and shareholders.Grayscale Investments’ initiative is obviously directed at elevating its reporting standards, thus making GBTS appealing to a wider array of institutional investors. Apart from the potential distinction of becoming the first-ever SEC reporting digital asset-based security, it would also bring a tangible improvement improvement in liquidity.While investors are currently required to hold their private placement shares for at least one year, this period would be reduced to six months if the trust’s SEC registration is approved. Michelle Gitlitz, Crowell & Moring’s global head for its Blockchain and Digital Assets practice, told Cointelegraph:“If Grayscale reached reporting company status, it would increase transparency for investors and may encourage more people to invest in the fund. More investors means more liquidity for shareholders, which is a significant benefit. For certain, those investors who are currently restricted from investing in non-SEC regulated reporting companies, would be able to invest.”The big question is: How much will Grayscale gain from a registration with the SEC? Alexander Blum, the chief operating officer of the fintech company Two Prime, thinks that it will facilitate gradual change rather than an instant explosion:“If its Form 10 filing is approved and it becomes an SEC registered reporting company, Grayscale's Bitcoin Trust will continue its incremental maturation into a mainstream investment vehicle with the oversight and heightened reporting requirements that come with that. However, I wouldn't expect a massive influx of new funds or listing on new exchanges, but continued, steady growth.”Dmitriy Berenzon, a research partner at blockchain capital firm Zenith Ventures, is hopeful that GBTC’s registration will spark an industry-wide trend toward increased transparency:“My hope is that Grayscale's move will push more crypto companies to voluntarily disclose more comprehensive information on a more consistent basis. For example, while the Tezos Foundation publishes detailed biannual updates and the Ethereum Foundation publishes high-level quarterly updates, I'm looking forward to a time when we see detailed quarterly reports from all cryptoasset-related foundations.”Blum from Two Prime thinks that even though many other players in the digital asset space could be interested in following Grayscale’s example, it is a bar that only a few are able to clear:“It's not a massive gamechanger. Other players might be interested in replicating it, but from a logistical standpoint — including quarterly reports to the SEC, auditing, accounting, and heavy legal and financial oversight — it's expensive and labor-intensive. It's a very high barrier for new entrants to achieve what Grayscale is doing.”Speaking of the odds of GBTC obtaining its desired status, Blum said that the trust is an excellent candidate for approval, given its current regulatory status and assets under management. Unlike Bitcoin ETF applications, Grayscale is not seeking approval of a new, prospective product but is simply carrying on with an already operational and very successful product that has a track record."

Chainalysis further ...","Nov 21, 2019","Large crypto exchanges appear to have stopped misreporting their trading volumes in 2019, a new study by Chainalysis says. According to the New York-based blockchain analytics firm, there are still some crypto exchanges including Bitforex that likely report fake trading volumes to simulate greater market activity and liquidity. Chainalysis posted the study on its blog on Nov. 15.","In the study, Chainalysis analyzed the top 10 cryptocurrency exchanges, known as the “Bitwise 10,” which were reportedly considered the only large exchanges that reported their actual volumes. Those exchanges include Binance, Bitfinex, Kraken, Bitstamp, Coinbase, BitFlyer, Gemini, itBit, Bittrex, and Poloniex.The firm used the Bitwise 10 as a representative sample of large exchanges who report accurate trade volumes, and compared their data with volumes of other exchanges in order to discover potential suspicious activity. Specifically, Chainalysis found out that in a period between January 2018 and November 2019, the average ratio between trade volume and on-chain volume received for the Bitwise 10 accounted for 6:1. The data means that the Bitwise 10 see roughly six Bitcoin in trade volume for every one Bitcoin received on-chain.Chainalysis further analyzed 25 other exchanges with large on-chain volumes out of the Bitwise 10 list. The firm eventually identified 12 more exchanges whose trade volume to on-chain volume ratios significantly differed from the Bitwise 10 in 2018, but have since declined more in line with the exemplary data. The 12 exchanges list included Huobi, OKCoin, UPbit, Bithumb, Bit2c, Bitbank, Bitso, CoinCheck, Coinfloor, CoinOne, Korbit, and Zaif.Based on the data, Chainalysis concluded that it’s likely that those 12 exchanges were faking trade volume in 2018, specifically during the period between July and January 2019. Since 2019, the exchanges' trade volume ratios have tracked more closely with those of the Bitwise 10, suggesting that they have stopped misreporting volumes.Ratio of Bitcoin traded per Bitcoin reviewed on-chain. Source: ChainalysisWhile the majority of exchanges appear to have moved away from faking volumes, there were still some exchanges that saw suspicious activity. According to Chainalysis, reported a trade volume ratio of 40,000:1 in a period from January 2019 to November 2019. That means that Bitforex reported 40,000 bitcoin worth of trade volume for every 1 bitcoin that enters the exchange, compared to just 6 for the Bitwise 10.Bitforex is ranked the 34th-largest exchange by trade volumes at the time of writing, according to Coin360.Chainalysis’ new study follows a report by crypto index fund provider Bitwise Asset Management claiming that as much as 95% of volume on unregulated exchanges appears to be fake or non-economic in nature.On Nov. 12, major crypto data supplier CoinMarketCap launched its new metric to compare exchanges and token pairs based on liquidity as a measure to prevent manipulation by exchanges."

Unlike previous statements about UBI, which he has termed the “Freedom Dividend,” Yang’s latest pitch appeared to touch a nerve with commentators. In the face of record-high U.S. and global debt, the idea of expanding access to fiat currency as a benefit appeared to generate more anger than applause. “Please be specific that you’re giving away fiat, not money,” Blockstream CSO Samson Mow replied. Others continued to highlight the distinction between Bitcoin as hard money and fiat as easy money which authorities can manipulate at will. Responding to Yang, Travis Kling, chief investment officer at Ikigai Fund, summarized:“Bitcoin is a non-sovereign, hardcapped supply, global, immutable, decentralized, digital store of value. It is an insurance policy against monetary and fiscal policy irresponsibility from central banks and governments globally.”By putting more units of an infinitely inflatable currency into consumers’ hands, meanwhile, Yang’s policy arguably finds comparisons to schemes which have already crumbled. In particular, OneCoin, the notorious cryptocurrency Ponzi scheme whose creators the U.S. is attempting to prosecute, was also known for arbitrary supply inflation.At one of its dedicated conferences in 2016, for example, co-founder Ruja Ignatova announced she would double attendees’ OneCoin holdings.A press release from the time states that Ignatova “told the crowd… that all current Networkers will have the number of their OneCoins (mined until 1. October, 2016) doubled, as a token of appreciation to everyone who believed in the OneCoin concept from the start.” She allegedly commented:“We do not expect a steep price movement after these changes. Cryptocurrency value is driven by supply and demand, and demand is driven by brand and usability. By creating more coins, we will be able to bring the coin to more people and places and strengthen the brand.”OneCoin in total conned victims out of around $4 billion — a tiny fraction of the world’s $255 trillion combined debt that is expected by the end of 2019."

It is not only the US that is burdened by debt. Global debt will reach a staggerring $255 trillion by the end of this year. This massive growth in debt is unsustainable and is certain to result in a major financial crisis in the future. Possibly, the next crisis might usher a change from fiat to cryptocurrencies.Crypto market data weekly view. Source: Coin360The installation of Bitcoin (BTC) ATMs has continued at a blistering pace. The total number of ATMs worldwide increased to over 6,000, with over three-quarters of the installations in North America. Asia lags behind with only 2% of Bitcoin ATMs, but this shows that there is huge growth potential.With crypto gaining acceptance gradually, is this a good time to buy? Do the top performers of the past seven days show signs of bottoming out? Let’s analyze the charts.  NEO was the best performer in the past seven days. It rallied close to 12% during the period. The cryptocurrency seems to be benefitting from the consistent positive news flow out of China. Can the bulls build up on the momentum and carry the prices higher? Let’s analyze the chart.For the past two weeks, the bulls have been struggling to breakout of the overhead resistance at $13.88772. However, the positive thing is that they have not allowed the price to fall below the moving averages. This shows that buyers are in no hurry to book profits and are initiating long positions on minor dips.The NEO/USD pair will pick up momentum above $13.88772. Above this level, a rally to $20.96333 will be on the cards. Therefore, traders can initiate long positions on a close (UTC time) above $13.88772 and keep a stop loss of $10. Contrary to our assumption, if the price turns down and breaks below the moving averages, it could dip to $6.65906.  Chainlink (LINK) has again found a place amongst the top performers. It moved up by about 4% in the past seven days. Does the chart indicate an uptrend that is likely to carry it towards its lifetime highs? Let’s find out.The LINK/USD pair has been gradually moving higher in the past few weeks. The 20-week EMA is sloping up and the relative strength index (RSI) is in positive territory, which suggests that bulls are in command. While the buyers have managed to push the price above the overhead resistance at $2.8498, they have not been able to sustain at higher levels. This shows profit booking by the bulls closer to $3.However, we like the way the price has been making a higher low consistently for the past six weeks. This indicates that the sentiment is bullish.Currently, the bulls are again attempting to scale above the overhead resistance at $2.8498. If successful, a rally to $4.5826 will be on the cards. Conversely, if the bulls fail to sustain the price above $2.8498, a dip to the 20-week EMA is possible. This can be viewed as a buying opportunity. Our bullish view will be invalidated on a break below $1.46. Cardano (ADA) was the third-best performer of the past seven days with a marginal rise of about 2%. During the week, Weiss Crypto Ratings tweeted that Cardano was superior to EOS, which divided the community, with some agreeing and others questioning the credibility of Weiss Ratings. This week Cardano completed the snapshot and balance check for its incentivized testnet on Nov.12. This will allow investors to earn rewards by delegating their stake. While there is development on the fundamental side, traders will be observing to see how this impacts the altcoin’s technical setup.Even though the ADA/USD pair has been rising gradually for the past few weeks, it lacks momentum. The up move will face resistance at the 20-week EMA and above it at the 50-week SMA. The 20-week EMA is sloping down and the RSI is in the negative zone, which suggests that the bears are at an advantage.A breakout of $0.0560221 to $0.0652290 resistance zone will be the first indication that the bulls are back in the game. Above $0.0652290, a move to $0.10 is possible. Contrary to our assumption, if the price turns down from the 20-week EMA, a retest of $0.0357780 is likely. We do not find any reliable buy setups at the current levels, hence, we remain neutral on it.Smartphone maker HTC will launch a limited edition of Exodus 1 that will support various Binance services. This is supposedly the first Binance Chain-ready smartphone. Binance will also be the first cryptocurrency exchange to integrate the Fiat Gateway solution announced by regulated blockchain company Paxos. This new service will allow users to swap between dollars and stablecoins on a one-to-one basis. Binance added support for buying BTC, Ether (ETH) and XRP directly with Turkish lira through its local digital wallet partner Papara. Fundamentally the exchange has been making the right moves but does the price action indicate that Binance Coin (BNB) bottomed out?The breakout of the descending channel was the first indication that the bears were losing their grip. For the past two weeks, the bulls are facing stiff resistance at the 20-week EMA, which is flattening out. However, we like that the BNB/USD pair has not given up ground. This increases the possibility of a breakout of the overhead resistance. If the price breaks out and closes (UTC time) above the 20-week EMA, a rally to $32 will be on the cards.Alternatively, if the bulls fail to push the price above the 20-week EMA, the pair might remain  range-bound between $21.2378 and $18.30 for a few weeks. Our bullish view will be invalidated if the price turns down and breaks below the support at $18.30.UNUS SED LEO (LEO) fell about 1% in the past seven days but still turned out to the fifth-best performer. This shows that the crypto markets are under pressure. Does the outperformance by LEO indicate demand at lower levels?The LEO/USD pair has been consolidating in a tight range of $1.05440 and $0.941 for the past few weeks. This shows a balance between demand and supply at the current levels. While the bulls are buying the dips to $0.941, the bears have been defending the resistance at $1.05440.A breakout of $1.0544 is likely to attract buying as it will indicate accumulation at lower levels by strong hands. Therefore, traders can buy on a close (UTC time) above $1.0544 and keep a stop loss of $0.94. The first target is a move to $1.35. Conversely, if the bears sink the pair below the support at $0.941, a drop to $0.866 and below it to $0.8278 is possible.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

One of them is VeChain (VET), a blockchain-based platform focused on enhancing supply chain management processes. The project is primarily focused on providing solutions that allow consumers and retailers to check the authenticity and quality of products they have purchased. ","Now with that said, there are heaps of altcoins out there that all aspire to solve a problem through the use of distributed ledger technology so what’s all the fuss about VeChain? Well, the altcoin has surged more than 100% in a matter of weeks and for crypto traders, this is very notable.For the first time since listing, VeChain managed to break the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA), as can be seen in the following chart.VET BTC 1-day chart. Source: TradingViewSome other notably entertaining keynotes can be found on VeChain’s daily chart. It’s not only moving above the 200-DMA and EMA, but it also broke a 14-month long downtrend. Similar to the breakout of the downtrend, a falling wedge pattern with bullish divergences marked the bottom during August and September of 2019.Remarkably, bullish divergences and falling wedge patterns are one of the most reliable bottom indicators when trading, and once again, they managed to be strict in the call. Given that this occurred in the daily timeframe, it often takes a while before the divergences become ‘active.’After confirmation, a slightly higher low was constructed before the breakout of the longterm downtrend. Notably, one can be seen that there was a massive increase in volume after the break of the downtrend, which is a strong signal.VET BTC 6-hour chart. Source: TradingViewThe smaller timeframes give a clear view of VeChain’s price action. A regular breakout of the downtrend, including a retest at 0.00000041 Satoshis (sats) before the break upwards to 0.00000062 (sats), the next target. Only a slight retest and consolidation was needed to push the price further upwards. This breakout of 0.00000060 (sats) leads to a new increase in price, which is currently aiming for the range high at 0.00000080 to 0.00000082 (sats).Meanwhile, the relative strength index (RSI) is showing its highest level since listing on several timeframes. This could indicate that some period of cool-off is ready to occur for the altcoin.Other altcoins across the field show similarities in the strengths of their price action. For example, is ZRX (0x), was one of the first altcoins to break out of a longterm downtrend.ZRX BTC 1-day chart. Source: TradingViewAs can be seen in the chart, a breakout occurred with high volume after a similar falling wedge with bullish divergence was constructed. Alongside the breakout, ZRX moved towards June 2019 levels, which led to a 170% increase since the bottom.Furthermore, other altcoins are also beginning to take steps towards their longterm downtrend lines and some are currently trying to break out of it. Another good example is Ontology (ONT), which is now moving out of an 18-month long downtrend.ONT BTC 1-day chart. Source: TradingviewOntology broke out of a 5-month downtrend earlier in November. This push shifted the price towards the primary downtrend (18-months old) which has currently broken upward. If it is going to show price action similar to ZRX and move back towards the June 2019 price levels, a continued move towards 0.0001500 - 0.0001900 (sats) is not off of the books.VET USDT 1-day chart. Source: TradingViewThe USDT chart is showing some of the same signals as the Bitcoin chart. A heavy move upwards from the local bottom at $0.003 (which was also a falling wedge structure), slight consolidation, and eventual retracement of the range high of $0.006. This retracement leads to a strong bounce of the $0.0051 level which was previously a resistance that flipped support a few days ago.The price of VET in USDT is currently hovering around resistance with the RSI in overbought areas. The price needs to continue to produce green candles to prevent it from creating bearish divergences, a usual top signal.Given the movements of VeChain, a bullish scenario is more likely to occur than a bearish scenario, and there are several scenarios in place for the asset.The first scenario would be a straight copy of the movements before the break of 0.00000060 to 0.00000062 (sats) a few days ago. In that scenario, the price will continue moving towards the range high, consolidate a little bit and continue its way towards the next level at 0.00000100 (sats).VET BTC daily chart, bullish scenario. Source: TradingViewThe second scenario first requires a drop first, which is a short term bearish outlook.In that regard, we still have to take note of the height of the RSI on several timeframes. That could indicate a retracement and retest of the range lows at 0.00000060 - 0.00000062 (sats) before the price is ready to move to the range high at 0.000080 - 0.00000082 (sats). Traders might prefer to look for a long entry in that zone or play the breakout if VeChain flips the 0.00000080 (sats) zone as support.VET BTC daily chart, 2nd bullish scenario. Source: TradingViewA bearish view could occur if the VET/USDT pair is unable to continue showing strength, which would confirm the bearish divergences on higher timeframes. In that regard, traders might look for a retest of the 0.00000060 (sats) zone and a possible drop below that area.VET BTC daily chart, bearish scenario. Source: TradingViewGiven the strength of the altcoin and the volume behind the move, it’s less likely to occur. However, if VeChain retraces back to the range low and doesn’t find enough strength to bounce with volume, a possible retracement towards 0.00000050 (sats) is a real possibility.There are several reasons for a possible retracement, one could be Bitcoin making volatile movements which would cause the market to become chaotic all over again.At this point, powerful movements and more likely to continue to the range highs.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

Already well-suited for securely transferring units of value around the world, the same technology that powers Bitcoin holds great implications for the world’s remittance businesses.Ripple is among the most relevant companies for those looking at this space through a fintech lens — its On-Demand Liquidity platform and XRP cryptocurrency have been part of how mainstream remittance company MoneyGram operates since August 2019. Speaking on stage at Ripple’s Swell conference, MoneyGram CEO Alex Holmes let it fly earlier today that 10% of his company’s business between the US and Mexico happens with help from Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity.The fluffy but blockchain-positive bit of publicity on Ripple’s website calls much more attention to the statistic. It’s exciting prospects if cryptocurrency technology can account for 10% of how a major remittance company does business between two countries, but when was this milestone reached, and that 10% figure accounts for what size whole? Reached for comment, Holmes went into limited detail:“The 10% relates to the ODL (On Demand Liquidity) platform and represents the percent of our Mexican peso volume that we trade. We take USD and buy Mexican pesos. We continue to work with Ripple to build liquidity. We now have four new corridors we are starting, including the Philippine peso and Australian dollar. True success will be determined by others joining the platform, so it’s early days.”For not wanting to reveal the size of MoneyGram’s US-Mexico business, Holmes seems happy to talk about the technology’s potential to bring ease of international transaction to new countries."

However, Herr pointed out that the demand for such an option is still very low, saying:“[Users] are pretty low, I don’t want to say infancy, but it’s a select group of people using it [...] We did some research, heard some discussions and conversations and one comment was it’s still complicated to 99% of the population.

China’s very pro-technology, so China will invest very heavily in blockchain technology and on the educational front as well. Given that China has now made that move, every other country in the world will have no choice but to follow or move faster. But it’s going to be pretty hard to move faster than China to be honest.”Hinting at states’ competing geopolitical aspirations to monopolize technology, CZ added: “I think we’re going to see a race there.” The CEO saw the impact of the pro-blockchain stance going much further, arguing that while the president may have confined his comments to the underlying technology”“You can’t learn just about blockchain without learning about cryptocurrencies. so I think we’ll see a lot more people who understand Bitcoin, Ether and other cryptocurrencies. So we’ll see very strong adoption there.”When quizzed on Binance’s China strategy, CZ struck an implicit note of caution — perhaps unsurprisingly, given the exchange had been forced to leave the country in the wake of China’s Sept. 2017 crackdown on crypto exchanges, relocating its headquarters to Malta. He said:‘We want to follow the recommendations very closely and to promote blockchain technology research and development. We’re looking at a number of initiatives in that area. We want to help wherever we can.”In Sept. 2018, Binance had made its first strategic Chinese investment since leaving the country in the wake of the crackdown, participating in a $200 million funding round for a Beijing-based crypto and blockchain publication.Earlier this month, Binance launched peer-to-peer trading for Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH) and Tether (USDT) against the Chinese yuan. As noted in today’s Bloomberg interview, the exchange has also been involved in over-the-counter cryptocurrency trading in the country, which raked in solid profits earlier this year.Speaking yesterday at BlockShow Asia 2019, CZ predicted — in contrast to other industry figures — that the digital currency in development by the People’s Bank of China will be based on blockchain."

Therefore, it is fitting that Bitcoin (BTC) broke into the limelight in 2009 and raised a lot of controversies right form the start. ","By design, all blockchain transactions are recorded on an immutable ledger. Therefore, even though it would take immense work, skilled auditors like Ernst & Young are able to find irregularities — as opposed to fiat, which it is claimed that 99.9% of money laundering is not prosecuted by regulators. Early on, criminals quickly realized the benefit of anonymous and decentralized trading, and thus started using cryptocurrencies to fund their illicit activities and to launder money. However, EY’s work shows that funds can be found on the public ledger. So, is money laundering by large criminal enterprises through cryptocurrency a major factor or will fiat remain preferred?The recent upsurge in cryptocurrency payments and related activities highlights the key fears surrounding cryptocurrencies being involved in money laundering. Despite strict regulations and increased vigilance by authorities, money laundering makes up a very small subsection of the overall cryptocurrency ecosystem. Detailed research in 2018 by Elliptic and the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies’ Center of Sanctions and Illicit Finance indicated that money laundering accounted for 1% of all Bitcoin transactions, which is the most widely used cryptocurrency. By comparison, a United Nations report titled “Money-Laundering and Globalization” estimates that laundering with fiat currencies accounts for 2–5% of all transactions. Speaking to Cointelegraph, Anthony Pompliano, managing partner of Morgan Creek Digital, aptly noted, “The choice currency of drug dealers, money launderers, and terrorists is still the US dollar.”While some local regulators have opted for or considered outright bans on cryptocurrency, the majority shows a desire to learn more about them in an attempt to positively regulate cryptocurrency.Cryptocurrencies have continually faced allegations of facilitating money laundering, while data continues to disprove this theory. For a while now, both local and intergovernmental regulators have warned about the potential for unhindered criminal activity that cryptocurrencies could help to facilitate — so much so that the term “cryptocurrencies” has become synonymous with controversy for the general public rather than highlight the benefits blockchain provides.Commenting to Cointelegraph, Aviya Arika, the head of blockchain at global crypto regulations and payment solution legal firm Aviya Innovative Law, said:“On one hand, blockchain allows from anonymous (or pseudonymous) transactions which raises, as we’ve seen and heard from many regulators and banks, substantial money laundering concerns. On the other hand, blockchain can be used a bit differently to enhance the fight against money laundering.”Current Anti-Money Laundering regulations are adopting strict standards to perceived threats, regardless that fiat is still the leader in money laundering. Many of the prominent cryptocurrency exchanges are adopting further centralized methods to prepare for a more regulated future. Those in favor of resistance from cryptocurrency exchanges say that bowing down to regulatory authorities will turn cryptocurrencies into centralized institutions like banks. To blockchain purists, this goes against the very core of what digital assets stand for: decentralization, transparency, and public accountability.According to the report by Elliptic, “Bitcoin has unique properties that can easily serve the interest of criminals.” The research further highlighted that Bitcoin’s alleged illicit use is mainly based on anecdotal evidence from two darknet outliers in blockchain, the Silk Road and Alpha Bay. While it is impossible to quantify how much Bitcoin is illicitly used, the same can be said about fiat currencies. However, with crypto, there is most likely going to be a record for regulators to monitor. A 2019 law enforcement report from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission stated that $4.3 billion fines and disgorgements were levied against companies, both large and small, that committed fraudulent actions. This number has grown for the same period last year was $3.9 billion. Another uptick this report highlights is that the number of fines this year increased to 862 enforcement actions, from 821 in 2018. The SEC has returned $1.2 billion to harmed investors, as well as suspended 600 people and 271 companies from the securities markets.Further, the main highlights of the report focused on rooting out misconduct that harmed investors and markets related to a Ponzi scheme, affecting 8,400 investors. The Woodbridge Group of Companies LLC paid over $1 billion in penalties resulting from a real estate scheme, which was completely devoid of crypto. So, is crypto introducing new dangers or are these simply the same issues magnified by FUD?Related: Privacy Vs. Security, Do Authorities Monitor Every Crypto Transaction?Cryptocurrencies could potentially be a better channel for money laundering only when transactions are completely anonymous and private. However, many cryptocurrencies are traceable thanks to advancements in the technology. Criminals now cannot easily use this channel as they initially could thanks to leaders like EY and other auditors, even with private chains.From the perspective of tax evasion, blockchain makes it easier to keep a record of all transactions carried out on the network. Therefore, with clear regulation, calculating the tax due would be straightforward. These records can be instantly viewed and accounted for when the need arises.Blockchain technology makes it easier for governments and financial investigators to follow the money trail. The complete record of transactions is stored permanently in a shared ledger that ultimately ties back to a bank account and an identity. For instance, Bitcoin’s public ledger presents all transactions right from the point fiat was converted into BTC. This makes it possible to identify criminals and their transactions. Such functionality is known as attribution and is something purists, like John McAfee, are attempting to circumvent.Despite this, many governments have not yet provided clear guidance on cryptocurrencies and have left regulations ambiguous, which is arguably harming the growth of the industry. For example, U.S. legislators are calling on the SEC to clarify regulatory guidelines on cryptocurrency. Governments leading on the path of cryptocurrency guidance are working on developing legal frameworks to regulate cryptocurrency use cases and manage taxation issues. The key to developing an innovative crypto ecosystem that gains mass adoption lies in effective and efficient regulatory frameworks. Appropriate legislation must be in place to ensure cryptocurrencies are more legitimized across the globe. From the perspective of the global AML perspective, the following measures can help to curb any incidents of money laundering:Know Your Customer compliance has prompted many large financial institutions to consider developing their own blockchains. Banks are using the technology for several operations, including customer identification (as detailed above), which is the main action used to hamper money laundering. Further regulation will bring about cryptographic protection by sharing updated records on a continuous basis with banks, exchanges and other regulatory parties. The risk now becomes how the data is stored and who performs the checks. This presents major centralization and security risks.If the only gateway to cryptocurrency is restricted to banks and government institutions, that may create further centralization issues for crypto. While blockchain technology can provide the compliance link between crypto exchanges and banks, it places a centralized power in between users’ access to the decentralized world. Speaking with Cointelegraph, Harish Gupta, CEO of Polybird — a global marketplace for securities that is regulated in the U.S. under the SEC and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority — outlined how this currently works:“In the advanced smart contracts of security tokens, AML is rather quite simple. The tokens just won't transfer to a wallet address that is not KYC'ed and approved. Though many such smart contracts today are not very advanced so a lot of such works need to be done manually.”Therefore, it might be possible that employees of some banks or governments could abuse the KYC onboarding ecosystem for personal or political gain. For example, they might have access to useful information and possibly carry out insider trading or reverse transactions of rivals. Another problem is that regulators disagree on the nature of cryptocurrencies, like whether to consider them as commodities, currencies or securities, making the interoperability of assets heavily restricted. It is clear that cryptocurrencies themselves do not provide the best avenue for money laundering. Yet, cryptocurrencies have been involved in some of the largest public scams over the last decade. Related: Scale of OneCoin Scam Unravels Amid Ongoing Court Hearings Ponzi schemes, investment fraud and other forms of theft have further muddied the reputation of cryptocurrencies in the eyes of the public. Furthermore, the impact of these scams has pushed a negative light on cryptocurrencies, forcing regulatory action. Speaking with Cointelegraph, Jude Regev, CEO of blockchain-based venture capital firm Jointer.io, stressed that “due diligence when investing is important yet increases the barrier of entry to only sophisticated investors while scaring mainstreet.”  Fraud is not the only worry, North Korea has used hacking attacks to obtain $670 million in cryptocurrency and fiat, according the United Nations. The country allegedly targets financial institutions as well as cryptocurrency exchanges. As Cointelegraph previously reported, a 2018 study revealed that the hacker group “Lazarus,” reportedly funded by North Korea, has stolen $571 million from cryptocurrency exchanges since early 2017.As with most new industry, there are some questions that remain, including: Where does the equilibrium between regulation and decentralization lie, and how can it be achieved? The choke point for the risk of money laundering is where crypto is cashed out from exchanges and transferred into banks, and this is where regulators are focusing. If exchanges establish a stringent compliance standard that meets or exceeds regulatory expectations, the risks can be significantly mitigated — although centralization then becomes a worry. The perception of governments and traditional financial institutions concerning cryptocurrencies could ease and open the doors for widespread adoption. Regulatory institutions will continue to stress the need to improve AML practices because of the absence of clear legislation related to cryptocurrency exchanges — and because of perceived danger rather than actual risk. Due to this reason, many centralized exchanges and businesses will continue to adopt robust AML policies out of choice rather than obligation for fear of reprisal. The crypto ecosystem is surrounded by myths and FUD. Being a nascent technology, it is quite normal for the general public to act skeptical toward something new and unknown, and for the industry itself to sway toward conformation."

This would potentially put the company’s overall market value at some $1.6 billion, with an enterprise value of $1.4 billion.An ADS is a U.S. dollar-denominated equity share of a foreign-based company available for purchase on an American stock exchange. In October, Canaan Creative filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for an IPO intended to raise $400 million, with plans to be listed on the Nasdaq under the ticker CAN. If Canaan is successful, the mining company could become the first China-based mining firm to see public trading in the U.S. As part of its registration to conduct an IPO in the United States, Canaan revealed its Q3 net profit to be 94 million yuan ($13 million). Although the company generated revenue of just over $134 million in the first nine months of 2019, weaker performance early on has still resulted in a total comprehensive income loss of around $31 million.Canaan, which is one of the three major Chinese crypto mining companies alongside Bitmain and Yibang International, previously attempted to launch an IPO in Hong Kong and China, but both attempts failed after regulators pored over their business model and financial outlook. Bitmain, which enjoys a 75% market share of the crypto hardware market worldwide, has likewise tried to complete an IPO, thus far meeting with failure. In October, Bitmain opened what it claimed to be the world’s largest facility for Bitcoin mining in Rockdale, Texas, which was completed thanks to a collaboration with the Rockdale Municipal Development District and Canadian technology firm DMG Blockchain Solutions."

Marcel Cyr, a resident living across the river from the facility notes that — while residents are complaining — the company has so far only expanded its operations. He told the outlet that residents want the business to cease operations until the noise issues are solved:“They say they are acting in good faith. [...] And in the beginning we believed them. But we no longer believe them. How can we? [...] The noise destroys the environment, destroys people’s health because of the stress. [...] We had peace and quiet, and we want peace and quiet to return.”Bitfarms reportedly manages five mining operations spread across the province to take advantage of cheap local hydropower. The firm struck a deal with Sherbrooke to pay the city about 3 million Canadian dollars (about $2.25 million) per year for its electricity use.City councilor Marc Denault admitted that, if the city had known about the noise generated by the facility’s cooling fans, it would not have allowed it to use the location. The councilor also said he believes that if the company foresaw such issues, it would not have chosen its present location.Denault also said that the company intended to address the noise issue and will renovate the building and build a wall outside it to muffle the sound. He claimed that an increase in the capacity of the farm will not increase the noise, stating:“We expect significant improvement versus what the residents are allegedly complaining about today.”Denault’s claims that the company is cooperative in solving noise problems are backed up by Patrick Melchior, mayor of Farnham, another place where Bitfarm operates. He said that residents had similar complaints in 2017, but the company has since improved the situation:“They were very cooperative. Their goal was really not to be a bad corporate citizen. [...] They reduced the noise considerably .. and the citizens were very satisfied. The case is closed.”Cointelegraph reached out to councilmembers from the aforementioned cities but has not received any responses as of press time.According to Google Finance, BitFarms’ stocks are trading at 0.53 Canadian dollars ($0.40). This means that the shares are down over 75% from when they were listed in July.Despite uncertain market conditions, cryptocurrency mining firms are seemingly optimistic when it comes to the future of their industry.

Do the technicals of the top performers of the past week suggest the start of a new uptrend? Let’s find out.Tezos (XTZ) has been the best performer of the past seven days, rising about 43% during the period. It received a boost on the news of its listing on the crypto exchange OKEx.  Another positive news was that Coinbase introduced staking rewards for all Tezos holders, enabling them to earn about 5% annually. After the recent rally, is it a good time to book profits or can the move up extend further?XTZ/USDT weekly chart. Source: TradingviewThe bulls have held the support at $0.829651 for the past few months. This indicates that buyers have been eyeing dips down to this support level to accumulate. The XTZ/USD pair has surged this week and has risen above both moving averages. It can now move up to $1.85. The pair has been pushed back down from this resistance on two previous occasions, hence, a breakout would be a significant event.On a close above $1.85, a rally to $2.87 and above it to $3.37 is likely. Therefore, traders can buy on dips close to $1.1 levels. Our bullish view will be invalidated if the price turns down and slips below the recent low of $0.75. Cosmos (ATOM) has been gradually moving higher for the past few days. It has risen by about 24% in the past seven days and is the second-best performer. Can it continue its up move or has it run its course? Let’s analyze its chart.ATOM/USD weekly chart. Source: TradingviewThe ATOM/USD pair has found support close to $2 levels thrice in the past few months. This shows that bulls have been buying on dips to the support levels. With the rally this week, the price has scaled above the overhead resistance at $3.6043, thus completing a triple bottom formation. It now has a minimum target objective of $5.2985. If the bulls push the price above this level, a rise to $7 is possible. Therefore, traders can buy on a close (UTC time) above $3.6043 and keep a stop loss of $2.90. Contrary to our assumption, if the price turns around from the current levels and plummets below $3.6043, it will suggest a lack of demand at higher levels. Stellar (XLM) surged on the news that the Stellar Development Foundation (SDF) had burned over 55 billion of the 85 billion tokens that were set aside for SDF operations, giveaway programs and partnership programs. The foundation said that the burning was done because it wanted to be leaner and more efficient. After its 12% rally, can it rise further in the next few days or will the price dip due to profit booking? Let’s study the chart.XLM/USDT weekly chart. Source: TradingviewThe XLM/USD pair is facing selling at the overhead resistance of $0.088708. With the rally this week, the price has risen above the previous low of $0.072545. This shows that the markets have rejected the lower levels. Both moving averages are flattening out and the RSI has risen to just below 50 levels, which shows that the sellers are losing their grip.If the bulls can defend the support at $0.072545 during the next dip, it will be a positive sign. On the upside, the pair will pick up momentum on a breakout of $0.088708 and the 50-week SMA. Above the 50-day SMA, a rally to $0.145 will be on the cards.Therefore, traders can initiate long positions on a close (UTC time) above the 50-week SMA and keep a stop loss of $0.067. Our bullish view will be negated if the price turns down from $0.088708 and sustains below $0.072545.Litecoin (LTC) has been attempting to form a bottom in the past few days.

There is a minor resistance at the moving averages above which a move to $80.2731 will be on the cards. The flattening moving averages and the RSI moving up slowly suggests that the bulls are making a comeback.Though positive, we do not find a reliable buy setup at the current levels, hence, we are not recommending to trade it. Our bullish view will be invalidated if the pair turns down and plunges below the recent lows of $47.1851.EOS rounded up the top five crypto performers of the past seven days with a rally of about 8%. There have been complaints of congestion in the network but it has not affected its price. Has it bottomed out? Let’s find out.EOS/USD weekly chart.

These new digital technologies require a high consumption of electricity, currently produced predominantly using coal and fossil fuels that adversely impact the environment. A global shift toward green energy will require the removal of the existing regulatory barriers on technology, infrastructure, finance and tax policy. In this series, my articles evaluate the tax, digital technology and solar policies (including space power satellites) of the countries that emit the highest volumes of carbon dioxide.","Proving the heliocentric model of our solar system put forward by European scientists Aristarchus of Samos (310–230 BC, Greece), Nicolaus Copernicus (1473–1543, Poland), Galileo Galilei (1564–1642, Italy) and Johannes Kepler (1571–1630, Germany) took 2,200 years, when the German–American spaceflight, the Helios 2 solar probe, cruised within 26.55 million miles (42.73 million kilometers) of the sun in April of 1976. Now, the European Union is solarizing its digital economy at a much faster pace. With renewable energy projected to comprise 90% of the electricity mix in Europe by 2040, three major factors are contributing to this paradigm shift in energy.Technological: Blockchain-based digital technologies are decentralizing and democratizing the electricity supply by enabling the interoperability of solar cell photovoltaic, or PV, energy produced from diversified PV assets with micro and macro/utility electric grids. This is keeping EU-based companies that perform efficiently, even in cloudy conditions, at the forefront of space-grade and liquid PV innovation.Economic: Solar energy is an increasingly attractive alternative from an economic standpoint due to the declining cost of solar energy, demand for solar PV panel installations in the EU’s smart cities, an increase in CO2 costs attributable to carbon taxes and environmental lawsuit fines, net metering subsidies, as well as funding — including from the European Investment Bank — in the renewable energy sector, as reported by the United Nations Environment Program.Environmental: Solar energy does not produce CO2 emissions, thereby improving air pollution and pollinator habitats to avoid a climate change apocalypse. A potential meltdown is relevant to the EU, as it ranks third in the world for CO2 emissions. Related: Japan to Solarize Its Burgeoning Digital Economy, Expert TakeThe EU’s commitment to solarizing its digital economy in order to lower its CO2 levels in accordance with UNFCCC’s 2015 Paris Agreement is backed by various initiatives undertaken both in space and on Earth.The European Space Agency is a space, weather and CO2-emission watchdog. With the Copernicus Climate Change Service satellite, it keeps tabs on the CO2 levels of all countries around the world. But since satellites are expensive to build and launch, and are difficult to update once in orbit, the ESA also utilizes a fleet of PV-energized, high-altitude pseudo-satellite, or HAPS. A zeppelin-like HAPS called the “Stratobus” is currently being manufactured by Thales Alenia Space in Cannes to track CO2 emissions.The ESA has also been actively evaluating the possibilities of utilizing Solar Power Satellites by formulating a European strategy to solarize earthbound electric grids. France’s Airbus Defence and Space is building an SPS that intends to beam earthbound solar energy via high-powered infrared lasers by 2030. Airbus is also making a HAPS called “Zephyr,” as well as a larger version of it that can be used for communications, reconnaissance, deliveries and even laser solar energy transmission. The world’s first HAPS base is already in operation at Wyndham Airfield in Australia.The ESA also continues to develop the different areas of solar electric propulsion required for deep space exploration missions. With the first picture of a black hole published in the spring of this year, the future may involve “using solar electric propulsion to explore black holes for alternate energy sources,” according to film producer Andrew Lauren of the French science fiction film Highlife, which centers on the same topic.Over half of the world’s population live in cities that contribute 70% of the global energy-related greenhouse gas emissions. “Cities around the world are the main cause of climate change but can also offer a part of the solution to reducing the harmful greenhouse gases that are causing global temperatures to rise,” explained U.N.-Habitat Executive Director Maimunah Mohd Sharif.Germany became the EU’s climate change pioneer with its Energiewende (energy transition) policy when it began installing PV rooftop solar panel systems in 1999 that now represent about 23% of all solar power generation capacity installed worldwide. More than a million German buildings now have solar panels on their roofs, with 1 out of every 2 new orders accompanied with a battery storage system. A decade later, the Danish island of Samsø emerged as the poster child of action against climate change, as it has been carbon neutral for over 10 years. This inspired Spain’s Balearic Islands, followed by another 26 European islands — including the world’s cryptocurrency hub, Malta — to commit earlier this year to transition to 100% renewable energy and ditch coal power. So far, most EU countries have committed to phasing out coal plants by 2038, since they are the most significant source of air pollution, indifferent to political agendas, and not contained by the national or city borders of the 28 EU member states. Austria — which is fully phasing out coal by 2020 ahead of other EU countries — is home to a solar company called Smartflower, which manufactures intelligent solar panels shaped like flowers that move along with the position of the sun. As coal-fired power generation can be replaced by installing solar PV panels everywhere — on coal mining sites, building rooftops and agricultural land — to.reduce CO2 pollution. Already, a former coal plant in Germany — where solar energy tops the list of sources for public electricity supply — is reinventing itself as a Cultural Center for experimental/electrical art that is fueled by green energy. Under the Horizon 2020 project, 70 EU cities are switching to clean energy sources that are digitally distributed using artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things and blockchain-enabled networks. Germany leads the way in EU’s digitalization of the energy sector, as outlined in its Blockchain Strategy. “Generating cheap green energy is no longer a challenge. The price of PV installations has tumbled over the last 10–20 years, so we’re now seeing huge investments in this particular energy source. The challenge is to link energy production from myriads of small installations across the landscape with a country’s total energy demand and energy production from other sources, some of which is also linked across national borders,” explained Marta Victoria, a professor who investigated and mapped the capacities of solar PV generation in the European countries that vary considerably from one state to another.Providing the solar digital link by creating smart-city energy districts are: Hivepower, ABB, Space10, Sonnen-TenneT, EDF Energy and UK Power Reserve, Insolar, SMA Solar Technology and Iota. On the latter, “The IOTA Tangle brings the promise of Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT) to the Internet-of-Things. A growing energy community of private and public enterprises and academia are now coming together to explore its potential in real world testbed environment, paving the way for a more open, transparent and decentralized energy system,” Wilfried Pimenta de Miranda — the business development director at the Iota Foundation, which is part of the CityxChange H2020 consortium — said in an email.“Pollution often is a silent killer and is one of the greatest health hazards in Amsterdam,” explained the city’s traffic councilor, Sharon Dijksma, about Amsterdam’s ban on gasoline and diesel-fueled cars and motorcycles by 2030. Similarly, other zero-carbon smart cities of the EU will need to address the role of solarized electric transportation and the blockchain-based energy network that will enable the interoperability between PV-energized transportation — such as cars, bikes, flying water taxis and roads — and the electric grid, particularly in light of Volkswagen’s “dieselgate” emissions-cheating scandal. The German Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems has developed a solar car roof with highly efficient solar cells to extend the driving range of electric cars as well as a new solar cell textile that is woven into truck tarps to power onboard equipment. Audi’s A8 already features a solar sunroof, and another two PV electric car companies — German Sono Motors and Dutch Lightyear — are working toward putting their cars on the road by 2021. U.S. electric car manufacturer Tesla plans to invest $4.4 billion in a Berlin factory to manufacture the company’s SUV Model Y, which could be produced as early as 2021. The Mobility Open Blockchain Initiative is developing a blockchain-based Electric Vehicle Grid Integrator that will connect electric cars to the grid, while other solar energy blockchain projects include an electric car charger and a car wallet with a wide variety of use cases, including ride-sharing technology that allows the deployment of underutilized personal vehicles to provide rides.Related: Is US Environmental Tax Policy Hindering Solar Power to Fuel Digital Technologies?The world’s first dockless ride-sharing program was designed by Luud Schimmelpennink in Amsterdam in 1965 to counter the rise of pollution from cars. Called the “white bike” program, bicycles could be borrowed and left anywhere in the city to be borrowed again by the next individual. However, the dockless bike-sharing system was unsuccessful due to vandalism and theft. Ever since, there have been at least five generations of evolution in bike-sharing programs put forward, driven mostly by advances in digital and PV technology. The second-generation bike-sharing program was born in Denmark in 1991, which allowed bikes to be picked up and returned to several central locations with a coin deposit. Theft was also a problem in this case, largely due to user anonymity. The third generation of bike-sharing systems was born in Portsmouth University in England and involved several technological improvements, such as bike docks that locked electronically, onboard electronics tracking user identity, swipe cards and telecommunication capabilities. The French cities of Lyon and Paris launched highly successful third-generation bike-sharing programs during the early 2000s and were followed by many cities around the world. The fourth-generation bike-sharing program, which won the Genomineerd voor de Computable Award in 2017, utilizing blockchain technology to track the identities of electric bike users and accepting payment in cryptocurrencies, was jointly developed by the Netherland Vehicle Licensing Agency and IBM, called “BikeBlockchain.” Today, an electric bike company based in the United Kingdom called “50 Cycles” manufactures cryptocurrency-mining e-bikes, enabling electric bike-share riders to mine cryptocurrency while peddling to earn their crypto fees, with a German company called “Mobility House” producing the chargers for these electric bikes. The Swiss city of Zug — or “Crypto Valley” — was the first city to implement this fourth-generation bike-sharing program, which utilizes uPort’s eID program to track user identity and AirBie for payments in Ether (ETH). The fifth-generation, solarized, docked electric bike-sharing program was designed by Christopher Cherry, Stacy Worley and David Jordan of the University of Tennessee, Knoxville in 2010. A U.S. bike company called “Electric Bike Company” recently began manufacturing solarized electric bikes. However, Cherry said in an email, “I haven’t seen anything more than a pilot test like ours,” regarding the implementation of the fifth-generation bike-sharing program so far. Nevertheless, PV panels are already energizing bike paths and roads of European cities.The world’s first solar bike path, SolaRoad — a 70-meter stretch of bike path between two suburbs of Amsterdam that generates solar power from rugged, textured, glass-covered photovoltaic cells — has been in operation since 2014. The world’s first solar PV road — a patented French innovation that combines road construction and photovoltaic techniques — was installed in 2016 in France by Wattway. Similarly, the world’s first electrified road that recharges the batteries of electric cars and trucks from two rails opened in Stockholm in 2018. Related: Is US Environmental Tax Policy Hindering Solar Power to Fuel Digital Technologies?The EU has the authority to develop a unified energy policy under the 2009 Lisbon Treaty. The European Commission’s Directorate-General for Energy is responsible for implementing the EU’s Renewable Energy Directive to transition to a low-carbon economy with the aim of becoming the global leader in renewable energy. The Renewable Energy Directive foresees that EU member states reaching a certain percentage of renewable energy by 2020. However, member states are free regarding the choice of support instruments for reaching these targets. The EU launched the Blockchain Observatory and has developed various blockchain related legislative and policy under the European Data Protection Supervisor.High-level industry standards for data protection, interoperability and sharing of key blockchain technologies used in peer-to-peer energy trading, smart grids, metering and aggregators was established by the Digitalization & Solar Task Force of Solar Power Europe. Danish blockchain company DataHub is developing a system to ensure meeting these standards in the electricity market.Environmental tax policy: The power to levy taxes is central to the sovereignty of EU member states, which have assigned only limited competences to the EU in this area. Therefore, the EU lacks a coherent renewable energy or digital tax policy.Carbon taxes provided the 28 EU nations and Norway more than 400 billion euros ($450 billion) in gas and oil taxation revenues in 2015.The EU ranks number four in subsidies to the hydrocarbon industry, at $289 billion, which is failing to decrease despite the bloc’s commitment to the Paris Agreement on climate change targeting net-zero emission levels. State aid issues: Since the EU lacks a uniform tax regulator, energy tax and renewable energy subsidies are monitored by the EU Anti-Trust Commission, which is in charge of policing state aid that skews competition within the EU.The guidelines on state aid for 2014 through 2020 allow aid to renewable electricity generation granted as a premium in addition to the market price (feed-in premium) in an open, competitive bidding process on a nondiscriminatory basis. For example, EU state aid law does not allow Germany’s tax rebates on solar power modules and other renewable energy installations of up to 2 megawatts, while Germany’s parliamentary finance committee (Finanzausschuss) has voted to align national taxation with EU laws. The collective commitment to renewable energy made by the International Renewable Energy Agency and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change did not stop the record-hitting heat waves that extended across Europe this summer and shut down power plants. “Time is running out — we are already seeing worsening climate change impacts around the world — including unprecedented heatwaves — and we need to grasp all opportunities to rapidly deploy clean, renewable energy at scale to prevent the worst climate scenarios from becoming a reality,” Patricia Espinosa, executive secretary of the UNFCCC pointed out. The World Meteorological Organization published new data showing 2014–19 to be the warmest five-year period on record.Further digitization in the EU is inevitable, with the financial sector set on establishing a blockchain payment system by 2020 to compete with blockchain-based payment systems developed by China and the U.S., a cryptocurrency-based trade finance mechanism called Instrument in Support of Trade Exchanges and the digital currency “Eurocoin.” Blockchain in the energy market is set to grow fivefold from its current market value to over $25 billion by 2024, as reported in a study by Global Market Insights, Inc. But on the bright side, the EU’s digitization will be solarized, with PV installations doubling in the next three years according to a Wood Mackenzie report, and self-consumption accounting for almost 40% of all new capacity installed according to the Europe Solar PV Market Outlook 2019. France has opened Europe's largest floating solar farm. “The EU and China are the parties that can take this forward,” said Frank Rijsberman, director general of the Global Green Growth Institute.Selva Ozelli, Esq., CPA is an international tax attorney and CPA who frequently writes about tax, legal and accounting issues for Tax Notes, Bloomberg BNA, other publications and the OECD.

Muzinich, who assumed office as Deputy Secretary of the Treasury in ...","Nov 22, 2019",The United States Deputy Treasury Secretary argued that decentralized privately-issued digital currencies can shift some functions from the state to the private sector.,"Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Justin Muzinich presented his view on the emerging ecosystem of financial intermediation and digital currencies at an annual banking and payments conference in New York on Nov. 21. The keynote by Muzinich was published on the official website of the United States Department of the Treasury.The recent conference was co-hosted by the U.S. Clearing House and Bank Policy Institute.Speaking at the conference, Muzinich addressed issues associated with digital currencies alongside regulatory and tax reform and the intersection of economic policy and national security. In his statement, Muzinich continued a common Treasury narrative on concerns that cryptocurrencies can be used for illicit practices such as money laundering.The Deputy Secretary emphasized that these concerns remain one of the top issues concerning the authority:“One of the issues at the top of Treasury’s mind is that digital currencies can potentially be used to evade existing legal frameworks — like those governing taxation, anti-money laundering, and countering the financing of terrorism.”Muzinich stated that the Treasury values innovation and welcomes efficiency improvements, but stressed that innovation powered by digital currencies needs a “very hard look.” He added that decentralized, privately-issued digital currencies are not simply a means of payment, but also tools that can shift functions traditionally performed by the government to the private sector. He said:“Digital currencies at scale raise not only concrete questions about money laundering, monetary policy, and other topics, but also very abstract questions about self-government. Those engaged in digital currency markets should therefore expect that policymakers, in pursuing the public interest, will take a very hard look at these issues.""The fresh remarks from Muzinich, who assumed office as Deputy Secretary of the Treasury in late 2018, are a logical extension from some previous statements delivered by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.In July 2019, Mnuchin criticized the major cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC), saying that it can be used for money laundering, and the authority will be preventing it from becoming an “equivalent of Swiss-numbered bank accounts.” Notably, Mnuchin declared that cash is not laundered like Bitcoin.In mid-October, the Treasury agreed to the need for an investigation into Facebook’s forthcoming Libra stablecoin following a letter from Representative Emanuel Cleaver."

Furthermore, given that the appreciation is usually obtained through the work of developers, by definition, an asset that is being sold is a security. Because of this:“And so securities law is then implicated and now you can’t sell a utility token as it’s not a utility token, it’s a tokenized security. You can’t sell it broadly and equitably.”Overall, Lubin highlighted Ethereum’s first-mover advantage. More precisely, he suggested that Ethereum’s developers had the opportunity to sell their cryptocurrency without complying with securities regulation because it operated in a still largely unregulated industry.Competing projects, on the other hand, cannot simply claim that what they are selling is a utility token and avoid registering it as a security. He noted that, because of regulation, it is possible “but very, very difficult for even a technically very strong project to challenge the early head start and the massive network effect that the Ethereum project has.”In a recent example of the consequences of the application of securities law to crypto assets, Telegram recently asked the New York Southern District Court to throw out accusations by United States regulators accusing its Grams tokens of being securities."

$134.1 billion to $154.6 billion during the 24 months following ...","Nov 20, 2019","At present, the combined capitalization of the 2,022 crypto assets with a known market cap was roughly $222 billion.","On Nov. 19, 2017, just weeks before the current all-time highs would be set for the price and capitalization of Bitcoin and the crypto market overall, the 985 tokens with a known market cap represented a capitalization of around $244 billion — a similar zone to where the market is at currently.However, with the capitalization of Bitcoin (BTC) having grown 15% from $134.1 billion to $154.6 billion during the 24 months following November 2017, more than twice as many altcoins are competing for an increasingly shrinking share of the combined crypto market cap when compared to the altcoin bubble of 2017.While 2019 has seen BTC produce an impressive recovery, the majority of altcoins have lost a significant market share when compared to 2017.As of Nov. 17, 2018, the combined crypto capitalization was approximately $186 billion after having shrunk by 21.7% over 12 months. Since November 2017, the dominance of BTC had fallen from 56.5% to 52.6%, with altcoins gaining an overall 47.4% market share of crypto capitalization.However, the number of tokens with a known capitalization had risen 75.8% to 1,732, increasing competition among altcoins for a shrinking pool of liquidity — with the combined capitalization of altcoins having dropped from $107.2 billion to $86.8 billion just 12 months later.Despite the number of crypto assets having increased by a further 16.7% since November 2018, the combined altcoin capitalization reduced by roughly 8% to $80 billion during the past year. As such, altcoins have seen increased proliferation in the face of a declining pool of liquidity for two consecutive years.Between November 2017 and November 2018, the relative market share of alternative cryptocurrencies became more pluralized, with the share of capitalization represented by altcoins sitting outside of the top 10 by market cap, increasing from 23.3% to 28.4% despite the dramatic rise in the number of markets.The greater pluralism in the distribution of altcoin capitalization in 2018 can be largely attributed to a decline in the relative market share of Ether (ETH) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) throughout the 12 months prior. Together, ETH and BCH had shed 23% of altcoins’ relative market share in one year.Of the 10 largest altcoins by market cap on Nov. 18, 2017, only XRP’s market share increased throughout the next year, becoming the largest altcoin by capitalization and representing 22.8% of the combined altcoin market cap on Nov. 17, 2018.While Litecoin (LTC) and Monero (XMR) both remained in the top 10 ranking of altcoins by market cap between November 2017 and November 2018, both tokens suffered losses in relative market share.LTC fell by one rank, from fifth to fourth, shedding nearly a third of its relative market share in the process — from 3.7% during November 2017 to 2.8% one year later. XMR also fell one rank, from eighth to ninth, with its market share dropping from 1.9% to 1.7%.Dash, NEO, Iota, Nem (XEM) and Ethereum Classic (ETC) all fell from the top 10 altcoins by capitalization as their relative market share declined in 2018. They did, however, retain their rank among the top 20.Related: A Different Look at Crypto Market and Top Assets, How Dominated Is It?Dash fell from fifth, with an altcoin market share of 3.3%, to rank 12th with 1.3%; NEO fell from sixth with 2.5% to 15th with 0.9%; Iota fell from seventh with 2.3% to 11th with 1.3%; NEM moved from ninth with 1.8% to 14th with 0.9%; and ETC fell from 10th with 1.7% all the way to 16th place with 0.9%.As of Nov. 17, 2018, the relative market share represented by the alternative cryptocurrencies ranked third to 10th by capitalization had increased from 17.2% to 19.9%, with XLM, EOS, Tether (USDT), Cardano (ADA) and Tron (TRX) having emerged among the top 10 altcoins by market cap.In just 12 months, XLM rose from the 20th-ranked altcoin, representing a relative market share of 0.6%, to the fourth-largest alternative cryptocurrency, with 5.5% of total altcoin capitalization.EOS also climbed, from 14th with 0.88% in 2017 to rank fifth with 4.7% in 2018, while Tether grew from 19th with 0.7% to place sixth with 2%, and ADA grew from 18th with 0.7% to seventh with 1.8%, while TRX produced the most dramatic growth, climbing from the position of 53rd-largest altcoin with a relative market share of 0.1% to rank tenth with 1.4%.During 2019, altcoin capitalization has significantly centralized among the top alternative currencies by market cap. Currently, the 2,011 alternative cryptocurrencies that do not rank among the top 10 by market cap are competing for just 20.61% of the total combined capitalization.In 12 months, ETH has restored its ranking as the largest altcoin by market cap and increased its market share by a quarter, currently representing 25.1% of the total altcoin market capitalization.XRP now ranks as the second-largest alternative cryptocurrency by market cap following a 39% drop in relative market share, which currently sits at 14.2%. Despite BCH seeing another 12-month decline in altcoin market share, the token retained its distinctive position as the third-largest alternative cryptocurrency by market cap, with BCH now representing 6% of altcoin capitalization.As such, the relative dominance of the three largest altcoins has increased 7% year-on-year from 51.7% to 55.4%.The market share of altcoins represented by the tokens ranking from third to 10th by capitalization also increased for the second consecutive year, currently representing 24% of the combined altcoin market cap.The relative market share of Tether increased by 160% between November 2018 and November 2019, with USDT ranking as the fourth-largest alternative cryptocurrency and comprising 5.2% of all altcoin value.LTC also saw a significant gain in market share, with LTC currently ranking as the fifth-largest alternative cryptocurrency by market cap after its relative market share increased by 66% to 4.7%.The sixth-largest altcoin by capitalization, Binance Coin (BNB), has risen from the 13th-ranked altcoin due to a 230% gain in market share and currently represents 3.9% of altcoin value. The seventh-ranked altcoin, Bitcoin SV (BSV), also constitutes a new entrant among the top 10 altcoins, representing 2.79%.TRX saw an 11.4% gain in relative altcoin dominance, currently ranking as the 10th-largest alternative crypto asset, with a market share of 1.6%.Despite the increasing centralization of altcoin capitalization among the top markets over recent years, many alternative cryptocurrencies have seen a significant increase in trade activity.On Nov. 18, 2017, the 10 most-traded cryptocurrencies reportedly generated $7.1 billion worth of trade during 24 hours. BTC, BCH and ETH amassed a combined 24-hour volume exceeding $1 billion, while eight tokens including USDT, NEO, LTC, XRP and ETC also produced a daily volume greater than $100 million. Overall, 23 crypto assets posted eight-figure volumes or higher.Despite the brutal bear trend of 2018, the combined daily volume reported by the 10-most traded tokens had increased 66.8% by Nov. 17, 2018. Only three of 2017’s 10-most traded tokens saw a decline in volume, with BCH, Dash and Iota seeing a dip in trade activity. During the period, 14 cryptocurrencies each garnered a 24-hour trade volume exceeding $100 million, and 36 other assets boasted a volume of more than $10 million.This time around, the 10-most traded cryptocurrencies produce $56.8 billion in daily volume — an increase totaling 381% year-on-year and 700% over the last 24 months.None of 2018’s most popular tokens have posted a reduction in trade volume, despite BSV and TRX replacing ZEC and NEO among the top ten. USDT, BTC, ETH, LTC, BCH, EOS and XRP posted 24-hour volumes exceeding $1 billion, while 33 other tokens reported more than $100 million in daily trade and nearly 150 tokens continuously producing more than $10 billion worth of trades."
116,https://cointelegraph.com,"Nov 9, 2019",Her Majesty the Queen Rules Out Crypto as Currency,https://cointelegraph.com/news/her-majesty-the-queen-rules-out-crypto-as-currency,"After 11 years of Bitcoin's existence, countries around the world are 
creating clarity for taxpayers regarding crypto activity. Will 2020 be the 
year ...","Nov 9, 2019","Only a few weeks after the United States Internal Revenue Service published new guidance for crypto taxation, the United Kingdom’s tax, payments and customs authority, Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs, has updated its cryptocurrency taxation policy paper for businesses and individuals.","The HMRC's approach in this policy paper is, as expected, conservative, and it stands in line with other countries’ tax treatment for cryptocurrencies. The HMRC explicitly states that it does not consider crypto as a currency, and the policy paper uses the term ""cryptoassets"" and not cryptocurrency.The policy paper on individuals considers crypto activity as a personal investment subject to capital gains tax that should be paid when crypto is sold for fiat, using crypto to pay for goods or services, gifting crypto or — unlike the position of the French tax authority — exchanging crypto for crypto.Capital gains tax is commonly used to tax crypto activity in many countries, such as the U.S. and Israel. However, while other countries are struggling to draw the line between personal activity and professional trading, the HMRC states that crypto would fall into the definition of business activity ""only in exceptional circumstances,” continuing:“HMRC expects individuals to buy and sell cryptoassests with such frequency, level of organization and sophistication that the activity amounts to a financial trade in itself.”The policy paper states that an employee’s salary and mining activity are subject to income tax.Mining activity by individuals can also be classified as a business activity. The HMRC will review several factors to decide on the classification, such as degree of activity, organization, risk and commerciality.If the mining activity does not amount to a trade, any crypto awarded for successful mining — or any other mining fee — will be taxable as income. If it falls under the classification of business activity, then corporate tax and a value-added tax may be due. In cases where the individual did not sell immediately and was awarded crypto, they will be subject to capital gains tax when that crypto is sold or exchanged.Airdrops can be treated as capital gains or as income tax, depending on the circumstances. If the airdrops are being given in the event of a chain split or in any other case that does not constitute a payment for providing a service or business activity, it will be treated as capital gains tax. If it is related to any service or other conditions, it will be taxed as income.If you are paying income tax on crypto activities, you may also offset your losses from trades against future profits or other income.It seems as if someone in the HMRC understands the tax ramifications of the volatile crypto market. The policy paper attempts to prevent crypto trades that use the volatile market to manipulate the taxes due. The paper has a specific rule for crypto acquired within 30 days of selling. This rule will apply if an individual acquires tokens and sells or exchanges them within 30 days of the disposal of the same token type. Those who will buy and sell the same tokens will not be subjected to capital loss up to the amount of the new tokens purchase on those dates.The HMRC’s conservative approach also applies to business activity. Crypto companies will not find crypto-friendly tax benefits under Her Majesty’s policy.U.K.-based crypto companies are subject to corporation tax on their profits and gains. Any goods or services sold in exchange for crypto tokens are subject to VAT.With that being said, the HMRC decided that under the Value Added Tax Act 1994, financial services supplied by crypto exchanges or any services required to exchange tokens are exempt from VAT.Companies paying salaries in crypto are subject to income tax and national insurance contributions on the value of the asset.The U.K.’s “stamp duty reserve tax” is charged on stocks and securities. The HMRC does not consider crypto as a stock or security, and therefore, there will be no stamp duty reserve tax on crypto business activity in the U.K.Without a doubt, 2019 will be marked as the year of crypto tax guidance. After 11 years of Bitcoin’s existence, countries around the world are creating clarity for taxpayers regarding crypto activity. Will 2020 be the year that finally shows a significant increase in tax filings?

non-privacy coins, since amounts are safely encrypted. But Mimblewimble ...","Nov 23, 2019","On Nov. 18, crypto researcher Ivan Bogatyy published an article on Medium claiming that he had found an extremely easy way of bypassing Grin’s Mimblewimble privacy protocol. As part of his efforts, Bogatyy stated that he was able to trace over 96% of all Grin-related transactions in real time, including the addresses of the senders as well as recipients associated with these sets of transactions.","What’s more striking is the fact that Bogatyy claims he was able to achieve all this by spending just $60 a week on Amazon Web Services computational power, which helped connect him to Grin’s native blockchain nodes. Not only that, but the Google AI research alum also claims that he could have quite easily exposed the addresses of “almost all” Grin users if he had decided to connect to all 3,000 of the system’s nodes. In this regard, Bogatyy wrote the following:“Grin still affords a stronger privacy model than Bitcoin or other non-privacy coins, since amounts are safely encrypted. But Mimblewimble provides a strictly weaker privacy model than Zcash or Monero. This makes it insufficient for many real-world privacy use cases.”As expected, as soon as these developments came to light, the future of Mimblewimble was immediately called into question by people around the globe, who began saying that the privacy protocol could no longer be trusted, since it was clearly not secure enough. However, a few days after the initial report, Daniel Lehnberg, a member of Grin’s core developers team, published a blog arguing that the “alleged” break-in was confined largely to the protocol’s already-acknowledged privacy limitations. He also added that the attack was facilitated through the use of a passive vector that did not have the capacity to acquire any actionable data.Lastly, Grin makes use of a technology called “Patient Dandelion,” which is basically a modified version of Bitcoin’s Dandelion++ proposal that was outlined in BIP0156. The protocol is commonly used to mask the IP addresses linked with any given transaction because it adds additional stem hops as well as other delays at each node junction. However, since Grin’s latest privacy scandal came to light, many experts are now calling into question the overall operational efficacy of Dandelion as well.In its most basic sense, Grin can be thought of as an implementation of the Mimblewimble, or MW, protocol, whose privacy is derived from two key aspects:Additionally, the MW transaction format is substantially different from Bitcoin-like cryptocurrencies, as it allows multiple transactions to be aggregated into a single larger transaction. This aggregation process is “lossy,” which essentially means that the protocol hides the size of asset transfers taking place between the involved parties, thus improving the overall scalability of the network. The process of mining blocks with Mimblewimble aggregates all of the associated transactions into a single block, thereby making it difficult for bad actors or any third-party entities to link inputs and outputs when viewing the chain on a historical basis.With so many conflicting details currently floating around on the internet regarding the recent Mimblewimble security lapse, Cointelegraph reached out to Jake Yocom-Piatt, co-founder and project lead for Decred, a community-driven digital currency that uses a hybrid proof-of-work and proof-of-stake consensus model. When asked to comment on Bogatyy’s claims and whether he was right or not with his assertions, Yocom-Piatt pointed out:“Despite an aggressive response from Daniel Lehnberg from Grin, I am of the opinion that Ivan’s attack is valid. The attack links inputs and outputs to most MW transactions, and it achieves this by monitoring the Grin network, where it can log transactions prior to their being aggregated either over Dandelion or in a block.”He then added that a few months back, he had published an article in which he too had highlighted the exact same weakness that Bogatyy was able to exploit — that is, once Grin’s native blocks have been mined, participating miners and affiliated nodes have the ability to monitor individual transactions that have been published before they are aggregated. This basically allows a third-party entity (who may be closely monitoring the transactions being published on the network) to potentially make use of the data in order to link transactions that would otherwise not be possible by looking at the information related to other mined blocks. Yocom-Piatt then added:“Ivan executes exactly the attack I described. While Daniel takes exception to Ivan’s post for various technical reasons related to terminology, the linking of inputs and outputs is hard to argue against.”Many crypto enthusiasts firmly believe that Lehnberg’s recent post is a defense tactic. With enough technical know-how, hackers or other third-party entities could easily retrieve a huge volume of the input/output data about the majority of the involved entities, as long as MW-based native transactions can be reliably surveyed before they are aggregated.With that being said, Ethan Fast — a co-founder of security-oriented crypto exchange Nash — is of the opinion that Bogatyy’s findings are incorrect because of his flawed understanding of how the Mimblewimble protocol works. On the subject, Fast told Cointelegraph:“He [Bogatyy] is able to demonstrate that an adversary can construct a transaction graph on the network, in the sense that input A became output B. But because of how the protocol works, this is not like identifying an output address on Bitcoin. Just knowing A=>B does not imply you know who received the funds in any useful sense. So my interpretation is that what Ivan found was already publicly known and he mischaracterized its implications in the article he published.”Fast then pointed out that a big part of the misunderstanding seems to have stemmed from the confusion surrounding what an “address” within the Grin ecosystem actually represents. To further solidify his stance, Fast highlighted to Cointelegraph a number of other instances where similar issues over Grin’s native operational framework came to light. He further added:“Grin does not have anything like Bitcoin addresses. In fact, every time you want to send someone an asset, you need to interact with them in a live computation, working together to create a transaction. Given this fact, my understanding is that being able to construct a transaction graph on Grin is not a major security issue, as transactions don’t have anything like public addresses that tie them together.” Despite Grin’s reputation being called into question after the allegations put forth by Bogatyy started to gain widespread attention on the internet over the last week, the platform’s core backers (as well as community members) have continued to claim that the assertions put forth by Bogatyy are inherently wrong and that there are many factual inaccuracies — six, to be exact — in his findings. Also, it is quite obvious that due to this entire episode, Grin’s financial value has taken quite a beating. The currency has dropped from $1.52 to just under $1 over the space of the past seven days."

McAfee delivered his remarks in an interview with Washington D.C.-based news agency The Hill on Nov. 11.,"McAfee argued that authorities should not require cryptocurrency companies and trading platforms to help them control digital currency use in illicit activities. McAfee said he hopes that the “societal impact of giving people freedom from an overburden and corrupted government” prevails over “what small part criminals are going to play in this technology.” He added:“You can’t put that responsibility on me as an entrepreneur. You can’t require me to assist you in preventing what might be a future crime.”As Cointelegraph reported last August, the United States Financial Crimes Enforcement Network revealed that the agency had seen a surge in filings of crypto-related Suspicious Activity Reports, the number of which exceeded 1,500 per month at the time.Despite McAfee’s assertions that cryptocurrency firms are not responsible for tracking suspicious behavior associated with digital currencies, other industry players are taking a more active role.Recently, blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis launched alerts for suspicious transactions across 15 major cryptocurrencies. The tool is meant to help cryptocurrency exchanges and other financial institutions mitigate their regulatory and reputational risks.According to a Chainalysis report released this spring, 64% of ransomware attack cash-out strategies involved the laundering of funds via cryptocurrency exchanges, 12% involved mixing services and 6% involved peer-to-peer networks, while others used merchant services providers or dark web marketplaces.However, in late August, Chainalysis revealed that stolen funds represented only 8.1% of all funds sent to cryptocurrency mixers."

It will certainly not be as decentralized as Bitcoin (as it will be issued by the central bank), but CZ thinks it is going to be a blockchain-based version of RMB. He explained his reasoning: “The Chinese government wants to push RMB’s influence globally. They want RMB to be competitive with the US dollar. In order to do that they really need to push this currency to have more freedom.” He went on to discuss the merit of having more choices among blockchain currencies in general: “Having is better than not having. Having stablecoins is better than not having them. Having Libra is better than not having it.” Last month, China’s President Xi Jinping called for the country to accelerate its adoption of blockchain technologies. He didn’t specifically call out Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, but CZ thinks the message brings positive effects to the industry as a whole. “Everyone that I’m in touch with who was laughing at blockchain before is looking at blockchain now. I think that’s a huge sign for our industry. When you learn about blockchain, you almost have to learn about Bitcoin. If you learn about smart contracts, you will have to learn Ethereum.” Bitcoin price spiked after Xi’s remarks last month. Some investors predict the Chinese digital currency will be issued within 2-3 months."

In a statement, James Putra — TradeStation Crypto’s director of product strategy — noted:“When we began to explore the crypto space, we saw a fragmented market that lacked efficient means of price discovery and order execution.”He added that the venture gives priority to maximizing liquidity, market access and fairer pricing. The company’s institutional investor team will be catering to institutional clients by offering them tailored support for their crypto trading.Trade Station was listed on Nasdaq until its acquisition by Tokyo Stock Exchange-listed Monex Group Inc. in 2011. The latter is well-known in the cryptocurrency sector for its acquisition of the Japanese crypto exchange Coincheck in April 2018, which had suffered an industry record-breaking $534 million hack earlier that year. Earlier this fall, Monex Group revealed it would be paying out dividends denominated in Bitcoin (BTC) as a mid-term shareholder benefit.

They enable ecosystem connectivity by sharing information in trustless, decentralized fashion.Ming highlighted several use cases where blockchain connects different ecosystems to create new value for the internet, citing IBM's Food Trust network as used by Carrefour, and several other partners connecting supply chains to provide more product transparency.Vinay pointed out that there is much debate about whether blockchains operated by governments and industries are truly decentralized or not. According to him, it’s not so important — there are several ways to understand centralization versus decentralization.“We are talking here about an intermediate technology that connects different ecosystems providing a new form of governance,” said Mohan.On the other hand, Tan stressed that in addition to cryptocurrencies, blockchain enables the creation of a new ecosystem in which industries can work together to share information, creating new use cases, and create new forms of social interaction:“Beyond cryptocurrency, blockchain technology is about collaboration. It's a collaborative technology that allows different actors to work together sharing and consuming data. That's amazing for governments, private institutions, and how society can create new things,” she said.In the same vein, Yeo pointed out that blockchain connects different parts of ecosystems and creates a completely different framework for governments and industries. “This is a new value industry. You can share information and set smart contracts for different parts of the ecosystem, this is a completely new framework,” he said.Lim stressed that collaboration is precisely the path to blockchain and the success of different projects. He believes that the interconnectivity between Hyperledger, Ethereum, and other blockchain projects will increase over the years.“We have to prove the value of technology and together we are stronger. Blockchain is about connected ecosystems, so increasing collaboration between all of us is very important,” he said.As Cointelegraph reported earlier, Chief FinTech Officer for the Monetary Authority of Singapore Sopnendu Mohanty discussed the importance of the blockchain for the economy, highlighting its specific usefulness for the development of green finance."

Evercoin claims that its new wallet is the safest hardware wallet currently on the market, providing users with an end-to-end encrypted ownership solution for cryptocurrency storage. ","Powered by YubiKey 5ci —  a security key designed to deliver strong hardware-backed authentication for iPhones and other devices — Evercoin 2 contains a hardware wallet no bigger than a house key. This is the first hardware wallet to use YubiKey 5ci for iPhone and USB-C for android devices.“Unlike hardware wallets such as Ledger or Trezor, Evercoin 2 uses YubiKey to provide 360-degree internet protection. It’s designed to bring cryptocurrency adoption to the masses,” Evercoin co-founder Miko Matsumura told Cointelegraph.Trezor and Ledger did not respond to Cointelegraph’s request for comment. Evercoin currently supports 20 digital assets, including Bitcoin and Ethereum. Users are able to hold their own assets, while the built-in non-custodial exchange allows them to swap popular cryptocurrencies. Users are also able to link their bank accounts in Evercoin to exchange U.S. Dollars with cryptocurrencies and vice versa. The Ledger Nano S supports 22 digital assets and features a unique display screen to provide an added layer of protection when making payments, letting users to confirm the amount transacted and correct address. However, Ledger does not provide a built-in-exchange.And while Trezor wallets generally support over 1000 coins, these also do not contain an exchange to swap cryptos.While Evercoin already functions as a mobile wallet app with a built-in exchange, Evercoin 2 is secured by hardware that is fully controlled by the user. This means that users get all the financial services expected from a service like Coinbase, but now have the option of keeping their private keys safe in a hardware device. With these features in mind, John Jefferies, chief financial analyst at blockchain security company CipherTrace, thinks that Evercoin 2 is not, strictly speaking, a hardware wallet because it is an authentication device rather than a piece of hardware that physically stores private keys on the device. ""It would be more accurate to describe the Evercoin wallet as a mobile software wallet that is protected by a hardware-based second factor,"" he told Cointelegraph.Matsumura pointed out that Jefferies’ definition is a correct stricter use of the term, but asserts that the current implementation goes beyond just an additional authentication factor because the key is being encrypted using on-key APIs rather than just the One-Time-Password features of the YubiKey.Nonetheless, Evercoin 2 contains unique features that are intended to provide enhanced security through easy-to-understand procedures. For instance, if a user loses their private key, they can go into the Evercoin app and show their driver's license to get it back or to receive a new one. This is unlike many exchanges and wallet apps, where losing a private key can mean that crypto is lost forever. However, if a third party is able to retrieve a user’s private key, there is the concern that the key may not be fully private anymore.According to blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis, misplacing private keys has resulted in the permanent loss of 2-3 million Bitcoin (BTC). While crypto users are often told to write down their 24-word private key phrase on a piece of paper, it’s almost impossible to ensure that this paper will remain safely stored and free from damage. “The thing to understand is what happens if you lose the physical hardware device,” noted Matsamura. “We then will need to recover your account using standard account recovery procedures from an Evercoin backup. The standard procedure involves a password to recover, but if you forget that, you can show your ID and recover with that.” Matsumura also claims that because the YubiKey 5ci functions intuitively, users can access their crypto in a safe and familiar way. He said:“The Evercoin solution works like a hotel key —  you push the key in to your phone to unlock it, and when you pull it out it automatically relocks. It’s a simple, known concept to grasp. When you buy a house or a car, you always have ownership of key. You should have the same thing to protect your account of bitcoin, which is what comes out of YubiKey.”  In addition, Evercoin 2 users will be able to make use of all of their YukiKey's other functionality, such as securing email and social media accounts. Similarly, existing owners of a YubiKey 5ci can add hardware wallet storage to their existing device by downloading the Evercoin wallet app.While these features make Evercoin unique, hardware wallets are still prone to vulnerabilities that can occur when loading boot code, updating firmware, intercepting chip-to-chip communications and physical attacks.According to Jefferies from CipherTrace, a best practice would be to have any type of hardware wallet certified by an independent lab like UL Labs to ensure that regulatory standards are met. While certification can be expensive, ranging anywhere between $100-200k per device, The Federal Information Protection Standards provides standards for encryption that is required by the U.S. Government. “I encourage hardware wallet vendors to pursue FIPS 140-3 or FIPS 140-4 to demonstrate that they have properly implemented the encryption in software and designed tamper-proof hardware,"" Jefferies told Cointelegraph. Unfortunately, none have done so just yet.”Jefferies also noted that the two leading hardware wallets, Ledger and Trezor, have both been hacked and have since been hardened. “In lieu of FIPS certification, I would select a hardware wallet that has a bug bounty program and has been available for sale long enough for penetration testers to have time to try to hack it,” said Jefferies."

These tokens would serve as “objective evaluations,” the PLA Daily has reportedly noted.An anonymous source familiar with the PLA’s administration is cited by the Global Times as saying that the main distinction between the proposed blockchain system and existing reward systems would likely be not only the security the innovative technology confers, but also greater immediacy:""It sounds similar to a KPI system that will give feedback to the troops very frequently,"" he noted. The source added that it remains to be seen what kinds of rewards the tokens would be redeemable for.Those watching China’s advance in the fields of data, behaviour analytics and surveillance will likely recall its notorious social credit system, which has been in development since 2007.Last week, the official Chinese state-run Xinhua News Agency has published a broadly positive and detailed report recognizing Bitcoin (BTC) as “the first successful application of blockchain technology.” While state media has continued to reiterate its cautious stance against the speculative excesses associated with cryptocurrency trading, the country is nonetheless appearing to tone down its erstwhile hardline opposition to activities such as Bitcoin mining.Meanwhile, President Xi’s recent high-profile endorsement of blockchain innovation in recent weeks was accompanied by the signing of the first national law regulating cryptography, governing various aspects of blockchain, due to come into effect this January. The People’s Bank of China (PBoC) is expected to establish China as the first major global economy to launch a central bank digital currency.Whether or not the PBoC’s digital currency will be blockchain-based and interoperable with other blockchains or not has been a matter of debate and speculation among industry figures in recent weeks."

The token allows transactions within Bithumb Chain which enables a plethora of different use-cases. Bithumb Chain is built by first rate esteemed professionals within the IT, security, cryptography and financial verticals.Bithumb Chain is the decentralized open-source protocol that powers the products, services, and infrastructure within the Bithumb Family ecosystem which helps capture value from both upstream and downstream of the trading business. To further bolster the infrastructure of the Bithumb Chain ecosystem, Bithumb Family has a variety of new technologies adding to the value network of the blockchain, including a creative EaaS (Exchange-as-a-Service), which is a unique protocol PSP (Profit Sharing Protocol). The EaaS allows users to access the service through one-click, and adding to this structure to incentivise users is Bithumb Coin (BT).Bithumb Coin (BT) enables transactions within Bithumb Chain and provides the necessary mechanism for facilitating true incentives and value within the protocol. The first principle of the Bithumb Coin (BT) mechanism design is to facilitate the flow of value of the Bithumb Family ecosystem, thereby promoting sustainable development.Token distribution has been described as follows: 30% of the token distribution is based on the user incentive pool, while another 30% is allocated for trading incentives with a point system which will be disclosed at a later time. The other functionality of the coin are as follows: Utility within Bithumb Chain for handling fees, usage rights of the Bithumb chain system and paying the transaction fees of the Bithumb Global platform as well as payment procedures for new products in the future. Through the system lease contract, users can also lease their BT to obtain leasing rewards. Moreover, BT holders can vote and participate in the governance of Bithumb Chain which includes project listing nomination. In effect, Bithumb Chain eco-participants not only participate in the formulation and direction of network development, but also the investment decisions of Bithumb Chain. Examples include BT allowing holders privileges in the platform’s marketing activities, including additional raffle tickets to BG Staging and additional rate of return when participating in token staking. Other perks of holding BT includes participating in Bithumb Chain events such as fair token distributions. Bithumb Coin has many perks designed for the holder.25% of the BT’s token distribution is based on the chain development and sustainability. The interrelationship of Bithumb Chain to BT can be analogous to how a smart blockchain city would function. Bithumb Chain would represent the city block while various members of the Bithumb Family would represent individual structures within the city and Bithumb Coin (BT) serves as the interconnecting roadway between the different structures within the city block. An example of this in action is as follows: BT holders can stake a choice number of tokens to become a community node of the Bithumb Global platform and regularly participate in Bithumb Family listing nominations. 50% of the platform revenue will also be used for BT buyback until 150 million tokens remain.

The company’s ICO phase is scheduled to take place from Dec. 24, 2018, to Dec. 24, 2019, in which time AlyCoin is planning to distribute 35 million tokens in lots of 5 million each with a starting price of $0.10 per token in the first lot. The company further claims to be ready to release over 82 million tokens to the market.AlyCoin also stipulates about its intention to operate in full compliance with corresponding laws and regulations, as well as procure all necessary licences and approvals. The company ensures that “it is not possible to guarantee that any such license or approval will be obtained within a particular period of time or in all. This means that the initiatives described in this document may not be available in certain markets, or in all,” which purportedly goes contrary to its business in the Spanish market.Earlier in November, the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority issued a warning against Bulgarian cryptocurrency broker 5 Capital, since the firm illegally offered Contracts for Difference designed to expose clients to the price movements of cryptocurrencies.In late October, the Malta Financial Services Authority warned of a Bitcoin (BTC) scam that shared the same characteristics as a previously identified entity. The agency cautioned the public that an entity dubbed “Bitcoin Future” appeared to display “the same deceitful characteristics” as a separate scam, dubbed “Bitcoin Revolution,” against which it had already issued two public warnings this year."

At the end of September the FSA announced a draft guideline, in which it stated that the composition and sale of investment trusts that invest in cryptocurrencies are “not appropriate”. Although the supervisory guideline is not a law, the FSA reportedly intends to restrict excessive funds from flowing into cryptocurrencies, aiming to “regulate before commercialization.''Meanwhile, Kenji Fujimaki, a former member of the House of Councilors and economic critic, said that the cryptocurrency industry’s call for a change from comprehensive taxation of 55% to separate taxation of 20% is not necessarily delayed. He added that in case the FSA is willing to promote the development of cryptocurrencies, instead of banning monetary investment trusts, he would like to request the FSA to reform the national tax system itself.Japanese cryptocurrency exchange Coincheck announced that it had begun offering Coincheck Tsumate, an automated cryptocurrency accumulation service, also known as the dollar-cost averaging method (DCA). Using the DCA method means that a customer purchases a fixed dollar amount of a cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin (BTC), no matter what the price happens to be, at a certain date each month. Some claim that the dollar cost averaging method is the best strategy for Bitcoin investment.More than 20 companies including Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, NTT, KDDI and the Mitsubishi Corporation have launched a consortium that aims to raise funds with security tokens.The Mitsubishi UFJ will take the lead in building the platform for trading real estate, corporate bonds and intellectual property as digital securities, while blockchain development company LayerX will provide technical support.The new blockchain-based platform, called Progmat, will handle various financial products. By using smart contracts, it will reportedly be possible to exchange tokens without going through a third party, aiming to automate the transfer of securities rights and settlement of funds.The move is further aimed at developing rules for security tokens following the enforcement of the revised Financial Instruments and Exchange Act next spring. Mitsubishi UFJ intends to launch the trading platform in 2020, which will allow individuals and institutional investors to participate.Cointelegraph Japan reported on Nov. 8 that Coincheck has denied any link between Stellar Lumens’ massive token burn conducted by the Stellar Development Foundation and Coincheck’s announcement that the exchange is about to list Stellar (XLM).There has been a great deal of speculation that the Japanese crypto exchange Coincheck was aware of Stellar’s 55 billion XLM token burn at the time they announced the XLM listing on its exchange. However, Coincheck has now formally denied that they had any previous knowledge of the event."

Meanwhile, United States-based Coinbase led the list.Binance is now ranked in 12th place on CryptoCompare’s list. Charles Hayter, co-founder and CEO at CryptoCompare, told industry news outlet The Block that Binance dropped out from the top 10 list following the hack of the exchange in May 2019. Hayter reportedly said:“Our new Benchmark includes a category for recent hacks for which we penalize exchanges. As Binance was recently hacked, it is marked down in the security category.""On May 7, Binance experienced a major security breach, in which hackers managed to steal more than 7,000 Bitcoin (BTC) worth around $42 million at the time of the hack. Binance subsequently noted that it will use its emergence insurance fund, Secure Asset Fund for Users, to cover the incident.In a press release, CryptoCompare said that the new rankings now include over 160 active spot exchanges. In its Q3 2019 Exchange Benchmark report, CryptoCompare found that only 8% of analyzed exchanges use a custody provider to store user assets, while only 4% of exchanges offer third-party insurance in the event of a hack.The company also pointed out an increase in margin trading offerings since June, noting that exchanges offering such trading now account for 62% of total volume, against 52% in June.As reported, CryptoCompare launched its Exchange Benchmark in response to a study claiming that 95% of volume on unregulated exchanges is fake. In mid-November, major crypto data site CoinMarketCap launched a new metric comparing exchanges and token pairs based on liquidity. Hayter reportedly said that liquidity alone is an ""insufficient"" metric and that exchanges need to be rated holistically. He told The Block:""We have always incorporated a liquidity metric in our scoring system for each exchange, using depth and spreads across top markets."""

The success rate for the new exchange is high due to these factors. Now, we have to onboard users, which we plan to do by generating activity from our retail platform,” said Marszalek.While the Crypto.com exchange will initially support popular cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), Litecoin (LTC), EOS, XLM, MCO and USDT. Meanwhile, the platform will be powered by the Crypto.com Coin (CRO). This native digital token will provide additional utility and benefits to users including liquidity, low fees and better execution prices.For example, CRO staking will provide users with up to 100% discounts on trading fees. Also, new digital assets will be listed on the exchange through “The Syndicate,” which is a Crypto.com fundraising platform.“CRO holders will receive propriety token allocation. We will also sell every new coin on the exchange at 50 percent off. The exchange won’t charge listing fees and will give users cash back for whatever they sell,” said Marszalek.Moreover, to increase the liquidity of the CRO coin before the mainnet launch, it will be paired with all coins listed on the Crypto.com Exchange.While Marszalek mentioned that he once had doubts about launching an exchange due to the high number of cryptocurrency exchanges already in the space, he now views an exchange as a necessary component for growing the influence of Crypto.com.“Not only is an exchange a proven revenue model — it’s also where most of the value occurs in the entire crypto ecosystem today. I’m not saying that it will be like this forever, but today having an exchange is a must,” Marszalek explained. He continued:“I was also against launching an exchange before we had a customer acquisition strategy. Launching an exchange isn’t difficult, but what do you do afterward is.”Marszalek is confident that the Crypto.com Exchange will thrive, as the company has already met compliance regulations and has a large user base.“We are assuming it will be easy for us to break into the top 10 exchanges in the next 5 years or so. We have a systematic way to grind our way to the top,” he said.Crypto.com Exchange is currently in a closed beta phase and will be open to the public in December 2019."

The United States did not have a central bank until 1913, when Woodrow Wilson signed the Federal Reserve Act into law. Since then, the Federal Reserve has been accountable for the elasticity of the U.S. economy through the expansion and contraction of liquidity in the form of credit and new fiat money supply. Retail and institutional banks abide by the Fed’s stringent economic rules, which in turn trickle down to affect the daily lives of entrepreneurs, corporations, investors, markets and the consumer. ","Today, the U.S. and most first-world economies are in the precarious position of tightening liquidity as a direct result of overstimulation. It has become commonplace to read about instability in the overnight “repo markets” and leading to the new form of quantitative easing. These are signs that the current financial system is starting to break down again, but unlike 2007, there is an entirely new industry built around the security, liquidity and stability of our money.Market repurchase agreement operations, also known as “repo markets,” have made national major media headlines over the last few months, including from Bloomberg, Financial Times, Business Insider — just to name a few among the dozens. But what exactly are “repo markets”? In short, repo lending is a way for the Fed to expand credit within the banking system. Repo interest rates are the interest rates that banks charge each other for borrowing cash. Typically, they follow the Fed’s overnight lending rates. However, we have started to see repo rates spike upward, pointing to an indication of supply issues from banks issuing short-term cash to other banks and an increasing demand from banks and corporations that need short-term cash. In 2007, we saw first-hand that when liquidity dries up, banks fail, markets fall, unemployment grows and economic output contracts. Since then, the Fed has been filling the banking liquidity gap by printing dollars under the name of “quantitative easing.” After ten years of providing the markets with easy money, the Fed reversed course in 2018, raising interest rates and selling bonds to clean up their balance sheet. Cutting off the supply of free money combined with raising rates has sent banks scrambling for liquidity, thus jolting the markets several times over the last twelve months.In June, the Fed changed course yet again, ending balance sheet cuts and decreasing interest rates. In September, we got our first glimpse into the consequences of overstimulating the money supply for 10 years then trying to get back to normalization. Although we couldn’t see which banks were the culprits, several banks showed their cards as the interbank lending rates rose well above the Fed’s set interest rates. In an economy that was backed by free money and debt, a shortage of credit and dollars can quickly escalate into a serious problem. With interest rates already near zero, it is difficult to see what tools the Fed will use when things become dire.For many early crypto enthusiasts, Bitcoin (BTC) offered a new type of money detached from the existing dysfunctional system. Bitcoin arrived 10 years ago in 2009 and presented itself as a new, asymmetric, uncorrelated asset class that was an alternative to mainstream finance. Its value was derived from a global network of distributed contributors collaborating through the mining of new coins while simultaneously securing the network. Throughout the 2010s, the ecosystem evolved beyond just the individual sovereign ownership of money and into the introduction of programmatic intermediaries like smart contracts, which further removed unnecessary human intervention. Bitcoin and Ethereum — and the new technologies they brought to life — have demonstrated the beginnings of what international cooperation can look like if we remove superfluous centralized layers in our economic systems that add friction and are quickly proving to be functionally obsolete.  There is a necessary balance to strike as we transfer from the flawed financial system of today to the more technological, decentralized system underpinned by blockchain. We’ve experienced the flaws of pure centralization via “quantitative easing,” but to make the assumption that pure decentralization would provide a utopian solution for global finance is a fallacy. Decentralized technologies provide tools to reduce costs and add efficiencies where existing technologies cannot, but there are elements of the existing system including people, corporations and governments that are essential to making the new system work.Bitcoin has led to an entire group of blockchains, including the XRP Ledger, Ethereum, EOS, Tezos, Cardono and others, each with their own specific use cases and governance. One thing that is common between them is an infrastructure for new financial tools to be built around payments, lending, stabilized currencies, tokenization and decentralized exchanges. Two blockchains in particular, Ethereum and the XRP Ledger, have applications being built on top of them that provide tools to lessen the impacts of another global financial crisis. Ethereum could be best defined as a world-wide computer that is formed by an infinite number of computers talking to each other. It offers the advantage of global applications, running exactly how they were programmed and without the risk of tampering by individuals, governments or financial institutions. In an era of endless fiat printing, establishing a reliable, stable currency that people can use in everyday commerce will become pivotal as we begin to witness the effects created by central banks. One project being built on top of Ethereum that is focusing on currency stabilization is the creator of the Dai stablecoin (DAI), MakerDAO — a type of decentralized autonomous organization managed solely by smart contracts and code rather than human managers. The concept of DAI is fairly straightforward: It’s a token like Bitcoin and Ether; however, it’s designed to have little to no volatility. To start, DAI is trying to be stable relative to the U.S. dollar — a big step in the digital world, as most cryptocurrencies are volatile. This paves the way for consumers around the world to transact without concerns of fluctuating value in their currency. Over time, DAI and other stablecoins can diversify in order to hedge against falling fiat currencies and start to peg themselves to fixed assets like gold or other commodities. Creating a stable currency today is already important in places like Argentina, where the national currency depreciated 51% against the U.S. dollar in 2018 alone. When these same effects hit currencies like the U.S. dollar, having a stable consumer currency will become instrumental.In order for digital consumer currencies to work, banks need to transition their infrastructure in order to accommodate this new ecosystem. This will not happen overnight and there will have to be a transition period between the current system and the new one being developed. An example of a company upgrading an entire industry for the benefit of businesses and consumers and positioning themselves perfectly to fill the coming liquidity crisis is Ripple. True to its slogan — “Instantly move money to all corners of the world” — Ripple is a real-time gross settlement system, currency exchange and remittance network. There are many inefficiencies in cross-border transactions between banks today. Slow transactions and high fees are a direct result of the fragmentation that exists between disparate entities. Try to wire a friend or family member money abroad, and you will quickly witness firsthand the frustrations with this outdated technology.It’s important to note that the company Ripple is different from the crypto currency XRP — the digital asset on the XRP ledger. The digital asset and the ledger were formed before the company but do share common founders. Although the company uses XRP for liquidity purposes, they do not control the currency or ledger. Ripple sells RippleNet, an enterprise solution for banks and institutions around the world. RippleNet consolidates the existing community of banks into a single network that provides real-time, liquid and low cost transactions. RippleNet is a payments network based on blockchain technology, with over 200 banks and payment providers worldwide and consisting of three main products: xCurrent, On-Demand Liquidity (formerly xRapid), and xVia; each serving a specific role.xVia provides one method for banks and corporations to send out global payments instantly, while xCurrent provides an instantaneous settlement layer between these banks. On-Demand Liquidity provides the liquid layer between institutions so they can reduce the paper currency they are required to keep on hand. More on this shortly.The repo markets showed the first signs of a liquidity shortage in 2007. As we once again see these signs resurfacing, On-Demand Liquidity could be the solution we didn’t have in the late 2000s. Basel III changed the regulatory landscape of how tier 1 capital ratio is calculated. Before the 2007 crisis, regulators could trust that banks had enough liquidity to remain solvent; however, following the financial crisis and failure of several banks like Lehman, that ceased to be the case. The new regulations mandated banks to hold pre-funded accounts, or existing pools of liquidity, to move paper currencies between banks in disparate countries. For example, Bank X in the U.S. and Bank Y in Mexico must now hold a percentage of their deposits in either U.S. dollars or Mexican pesos in order to move currencies between one another. This requirement ties up billions of dollars in working capital and is an inefficient solution to ensure liquidity. xCurrent puts a temporary blockchain between Bank X and Bank Y. When Bank Y wants to receive U.S. dollars from Bank X, rather than Bank X having to hold those dollars on reserve at Bank Y to ensure proper liquidity, they can sell dollars for XRP. The XRP can be sent to Bank Y, who can then sell it in exchange for U.S. dollars. Both banks can maintain full control of their reserves, bringing that working capital back to their individual institution. As we watch for more signs of a global liquidity shortfall, companies like Ripple will be worth keeping a close eye on. The current system is showing its age, but this time, we have new tools to help us avoid the pitfalls of the last crisis while providing the infrastructure for a productive and healthy financial future.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.Stephen King, a commercial real estate veteran and next generation innovator, is the founder and president of Imbrex, the first property marketplace to syndicate on the Ethereum blockchain.

Due to this, she thinks adapting regulations on these new technologies is particularly important, stating:“It is great to see the adaptability of our common law system to fast-changing technology, demonstrated in this landmark legal statement from the UKJT. Tech Nation is excited to work with the Lawtech Delivery Panel on leading initiatives such as this, to support business growth, clarity in law and the evolution of new tech.”Tech Nation notes that many believe legal uncertainty is the most significant barrier to cryptocurrency and smart contract adoption. The legal statement in question is reportedly a substantial step towards addressing the lack of regulatory clarity. Chancellor to the High Court and chair of the U.K. Jurisdiction Taskforce Geoffrey Vos also recognized the potential of crypto assets and smart contracts, saying:“In legal terms, cryptoassets and smart contracts undoubtedly represent the future. I hope that the Legal Statement will go a long way towards providing much needed market confidence, legal certainty and predictability in areas that are of great importance to the technological and legal communities and to the global financial services industry.”Per the report, the statement will serve as a foundation for the mainstream adoption of crypto assets and smart contracts in the United Kingdom and provide a strategic advantage to blockchain startups operating in the country.The LawTech Delivery Panel is a team of industry experts and insiders from the government and judiciary space which aims to help the growth of the U.K.’s judiciary system."

supports ERC-20 and TRC-10 tokens. Multiple decentralized financial, or 
DeFi, ...","Nov 20, 2019","In October, web browser developer Opera Software AS launched added support for in-browser transactions with Bitcoin (BTC) and Tron (TRX). This follows the company’s initial launch of an in-browser Ether (ETH) wallet in 2018. The latest announcement is part of the company’s grander plan to make the “Web 3.0” easier to access for the average consumer.","Opera, based in Norway, is the first major browser to develop and integrate a native crypto wallet, which also supports direct transactions. The company started testing the in-browser payment feature in July through a beta version of the Opera for Android browser.Opera’s move fits into a larger narrative of companies integrating cryptocurrency into existing systems and networks that people already use. Brave Software Inc., another web browser developer, had first incorporated wallet technology into its browser to allow web users to earn cryptocurrency for performing or permitting certain actions that they already do with traditional browsers without earning anything. Other platforms looking to implement similar Web 3.0 features are also active.Cryptocurrencies are still more popular in the developed world than in developing markets, where most of the world’s financially excluded people live. Opera’s moves to enable Web 3.0 can potentially bring cryptocurrency to several financially excluded people. That’s thanks to the browser’s popularity in the developing world, especially Africa. Opera browsers are popular for their data-saving features. The company claimed that data savings in its products helped users in Africa save nearly $100 million in 2018.Therefore, making crypto wallets easily accessible to this group of consumers could be a big step toward using cryptocurrencies to offer financial services to the unbanked and underbanked. In addition to Bitcoin, Ether and Tron, the Opera crypto wallet also supports ERC-20 and TRC-10 tokens. Multiple decentralized financial, or DeFi, products are already being built using certain ERC tokens.Opera’s push to expand access to Web 3.0 could also impact the burgeoning betting industry in Africa. The combined size of the gambling market in Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa was worth an estimated $37 billion in 2018.When asked on how Opera’s latest developments could potentially help onboard new crypto users through gambling, Tron founder and CEO Justin Sun told Cointelegraph that Wink, a decentralized application built on the Tron blockchain is working now with seamless integration. “Users can simply use the Opera browser to play Wink by logging onto Wink.org without using any 3rd party wallets. We expect to see more TRON DApps integrated within Opera in the future, in similar fashion.”According to Opera, 350 million people use its browsers globally — nearly 120 million of those are in Africa. It’s worth noting, however, that Opera’s crypto wallet is only available on the “Opera browser with free VPN” application on Android and the “Opera Touch” browser on iOS. There isn’t any data to tell what portion of the 350 million users use Opera Mini. Still, this means that the crypto wallet is available to fewer than 350 million users. If Opera Mini has the largest user base, then the number of people who can use the Opera crypto wallet could be significantly lower. Opera didn’t respond to a request for comment regarding this.Opera isn’t the first company to have integrated functionalities for cryptocurrencies into an existing network to foster quicker adoption, as the Brave browser is another web-surfing tool spearheading the crypto charge. Brave was the first to reimagine using browsers as a tool to foster crypto adoption through its privacy-focused Brave browser. The browser gives internet users power over their data by blocking tracking services and ads. Instead, Brave allows users to earn native Basic Attention Token (BAT) when they view advertisements. Users can also use the BAT to reward platforms and content creators of their liking. The browser recently reached 9 million active monthly users.As Opera appears to be targeting the user base that cares about cost-saving for crypto adoption, Brave’s target is the privacy-loving customers.In August, Brave went beyond its native wallet that only supports its rewards programs to integrate an Ether wallet that supports ETH as well as most Ethereum tokens and collectibles. Unlike its Brave Rewards system, the Ether wallet doesn’t require users to take part in Know Your Customer procedure and can interact with DApps. The browser also allows users to connect a hardware wallet in addition to other layers of protection, according to Brian Bondy, Brave’s chief technology officer and co-founder, who told Cointelegraph: “Our Crypto Wallets feature can be used with hardware wallets (Ledger, Trezor) for users who would like the added security. Additionally, our Crypto Wallet is based on an extension and the background page for that extension has its own process and address space.”Brave has made it clear, however, that its wallet is targeted at “people who already have a working understanding of cryptocurrency generally.” Still, Brave appears interested in using the existing browser network to further the adoption of blockchain and cryptocurrency.“We’re excited to continue pushing the envelope when it comes to support for cryptocurrency and other blockchain applications on the web platform,” Brave said in its announcement of its crypto wallet.Beyond browsers, different companies are tapping into existing networks and systems to promote the use of cryptocurrencies. In September, Gibraltar-based IOV Labs acquired Spanish-oriented social media platform Taringa, which has 30 million users. IOV Labs, which powers the RSK Bitcoin smart contact platform, sees an opportunity in tapping into data from the social network to build, test and distribute decentralized products based on its smart contract platform and its native RIF token. In the end, it hopes to bring wider adoption to Bitcoin. IOV Labs CEO Diego Gutiérrez Zaldívar told Cointelegraph that:“Latin America, a market already in need of financial services as half of the population is unbanked. The values inherent in the development of Bitcoin, blockchain and Taringa are one and the same, empowering individuals by giving them a voice and the economic tools they need to thrive.”IOV Labs plans to incentivize Taringa users to participate meaningfully in the communities hosted on the social network by rewarding them with RIF tokens. Zaldívar added that:“We know blockchain technology can meet the existing needs of these users far more effectively than existing systems, by protecting user privacy, and sharing the economic value and reputation users create with their interactions.”In 2017, Aptoide started developing AppCoins, an open-source and distributed protocol for app stores based on the Ethereum blockchain. It raised over $16.8 million in an initial coin offering for AppCoins’ development. For Aptoide, which claimed to have more than 200 million users, integrating a blockchain-based system was a natural step, owing to its community-oriented approach to app distribution.Aptoide’s chief operating officer and creator, Álvaro Pinto, told Cointelegraph that Aptoide has been a community-driven app store since inception. With Aptoide, users can create their own list of apps, which can be shared with family, friends and colleagues to foster deeper app engagement.Part of Aptoide’s aim is to make in-app payment simpler in emerging markets, where it has the majority of its users. In these countries, it can be difficult for users to make in-app purchases because one can only buy them using a credit card, PayPal and gift cards as Pinto explained:“We have this huge amount of people using smartphones, but if you look into the number, the number of users doing in-app purchases and buying digital goods in the app stores is very limited.” However, Pinto is adamant that the problem isn’t affordability. He believes that many people can afford to make 50-cent purchases, but the process for making such purchases is difficult. Pinto added:“We’re starting to see the common user having their first experience with blockchain, and that was part of the idea — to take blockchain to the average user and to all this gigantic user base of Android.”"

The way they rolled it out… Yeah, you know it was just so... It was just so in your face. There’s a lack of understanding.” Rutter continued: “When we saw [Facebook] talking about doing a basket of currencies with weighting, in reality when we want to translate that back to real-world currencies it’s not simple.[...] It’s really naïve.”While global regulators continue arguing about Libra’s expediency and look to reach common ground on the issue, the Libra Association is proceeding with the development of the Libra network. The association has reportedly logged over 30 projects and 51,000 transactions on the Libra network during the past two months.Moreover, the organization is planning to introduce a range of new features in upcoming months, such as the  launch of a new process for completing Contributor License Agreements and establishment of a Technical Steering Committee, which is set to supervise and manage the technical design and development of the Libra network on behalf of association members.Also, Facebook announced the launch of its new fiat payment system dubbed Facebook Pay. The payment system is designed to facilitate payments across Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp."

alternative full-node Bitcoin implementation written in go, whose source ...","Nov 19, 2019","The topic of decentralized autonomous organizations is echoing loud and clear from the halls of this year’s DevCon to CryptoTwitter. Multiple projects at DevCon, including Aragon and MolochDAO, presented their commitments to decentralize power across a DAO, or, a group organized by rules encoded as a computer program. DAOs are transparent and controlled by the community rather than a centralized authority, such as a government, bank or corporation. ","Related: What is DAOKey to the formation of a DAO is the organization around a particular purpose or mission. For example, Aragon is organized to enable new types of sovereign organizations. MolochDAO exists to fund Ethereum infrastructure. The mission of the Decred DAO is to enable direct sovereignty over the protocol, which is built to be a sustainable and long-term store of value. Based on my experience, I’d like to share four lessons in DAO de-leadership, which correspond with the four aspects required to realize the purpose of a successful DAO: 1) humble leadership that writes itself out as the project grows; 2) funding free from special interests; 3) active development; and 4) strong community participation in decision-making. Leaders need to drop their egos and edge themselves out. Egos are dangerous when you’re trying to decentralize, as they tend to cling to their own importance and power. However, a leader must be able to let go, and over time, relinquish all control to the DAO. For example, we’re currently decentralizing control of the treasury, and the community already votes to determine the budget allocation process. Too many founders overstay their authority or create a small group of decision-makers that maintain centralized control — yet another central planning committee. Even respected projects like MakerDAO struggle to put power directly in the hands of the community. It’s an ongoing exercise in trusting the collective intelligence of the community rather than looking to a founder, expert or oracle. Without the relinquishment of power, the DAO remains centralized and there is no certainty it persists beyond the life of the founder.You need developer and project funding.Right now, project funding typically comes from corporate entities, i.e., venture capital, foundations, ICOs or similar, and even individuals who deposit funds in exchange for voting power. With funding typically coming from legacy financial systems, new methods are required to ensure sustainable funding in these uncharted waters. No infrastructure exists, we have no models to emulate, so DAOs must forge the path, overcome roadblocks and find creative solutions. The establishment is not going down without a fight, as we’re seeing with Facebook’s Libra, but resistance is futile. Decentralization is already happening. MolochDAO is an example of a benefactor model for funding Ethereum developers. Whether or not this will stand the test of time is still to be determined. Community funding initiatives are a way to avoid venture capitals who need a return on their investment. DAOs are becoming a new way for community members to back a project, although VCs can participate as well. With Decred, we have a continuously self-funding treasury derived from 10% of each block reward, which is used for project-level expenses. In the long-term, broader solutions make more sense because they are sustainable. Decentralizing a treasury, adding privacy, or creating a decentralized exchange all contribute toward the long-term health of the project. None of these initiatives yield immediate payouts, and none of them would likely be funded if the source of funding needed to realize short term gains. These projects define the long-term direction of both the DAO and the broader ecosystem they wish to build. The return on these infrastructure investments is on a decades-long horizon, and for those who are patient, it will yield immeasurable value.A successful DAO is like a smooth-running machine, but will still hit some bumps.The technical commitment required to build a successful DAO is monumental. Too many projects talk about developing new features or upgrades, but in reality they lack a holistic game plan to recruit and retain the right development talent. Ethereum, for example, is a massive base layer to decentralized finance and decentralized apps, but its long development delays mean other projects built on top of it are also in a holding pattern waiting for results. On its blog last year, Aragon said, “Making organizations upgradeable is key, so they can last as long as the Ethereum blockchain is up (or even beyond Ethereum).” To do so, agile and adaptable development are needed. If a project’s base layer has issues, it can create serious problems, like Ethereum’s base layer changes that caused problems for Aragon smart contracts. Rather than trying to steer a slow-moving ship, DAOs need to give individual contributors the autonomy to move fast. Decred employs independent contractors to develop features so they are often able to move faster on the projects that most interest them. For example, one team of agile developers created our first mobile wallet app, while another group passionate about security developed our initial privacy release a few months back.Actions speak louder than words.A DAO’s participants will become disenfranchised without sovereignty distributed amongst them. We see this all the time in politics as apathy sets in when voters don’t believe their voice matters. Members of a DAO must have real efficacy, not just the ability to comment on decisions, or worse — having no platform to engage at all. The more participation in decision-making or voting, the fairer the outcome and the healthier the DAO will be.When it comes to voting in a DAO, there are two ways: votes can be direct or delegated. Delegated voting is no different than representative democracy, where a select group could easily act in their short-term or personal interests over the long-term benefits of the entire community. Take EOS for example: This year alone, millions of dollars in profit are heading to a select group of block producers who also control much of the delegated voting, self-electing without any actual regard to their behavior or merit. This isn’t the way a DAO should function, and it’s antithetical to the health of the network.Direct participation ensures that all parties are designing a future that works long-term. Direct voting means individuals have hard sovereignty and must live with the consequences of their decisions, while delegated systems mean DAO members aren’t truly vested. Instead, they're simply staking in hopes of making money. In Decred’s Politeia, a blockchain-anchored project management proposal system, individuals have a real voice. Not only do they publicly debate proposals, but their votes determine whether or not the proposals are implemented. In its first year, Politeia’s mean voter participation was 31.2%, with its highest voter turnout representing a majority of the community at 51.7% voted. Thus far, no proposal has failed to hit 20% quorum. This is direct sovereignty in action. It works to engage voters, it’s the most fair, and the most decentralized.In the end, creating a DAO means pioneering uncharted territory. But we’re all in this together, and the best way forward is to align the motivations and incentives of the different parties that participate in the DAO. This means, intelligent design from genesis is crucial, but so is transparently setting an example and collaborating with other DAOs in the learning process. The right incentive systems and effective ways to participate will enable our communities to realize their visions for the DAO.In 2020, I expect higher scrutiny on DAOs using delegated voting, and greater work engaging communities across the board. It’s already shaping up to be an exciting year ahead, and I plan to continue letting go of my authority until the collective intelligence is all that exists.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.Jake Yocom-Piatt — Decred co-founder and project lead — is a cryptocurrency pioneer who has been using, funding and directing the creation of open-source software for over 10 years.

He said:“Other countries, which are ahead of us on regulation, are leading in this new marketplace and dictating the rules that we’ll need to follow once we catch up.”Yang explained that cryptocurrencies and digital assets already compose a great deal of economic activity. The governmental response has lagged. “A national framework for regulating these assets has failed to emerge, with several federal agencies claiming conflicting jurisdictions,” he said.In his broader plan to regulate the tech industry and protect U.S. citizens from big tech companies “that are prioritizing profits over our well-being,” Yang promises to promote legislation on the crypto asset market space by defining what a token is, when a token is a security, and clarify the tax implications of owning, selling, and trading digital assets, among others.Yang further pointed out that in order to effectively regulate innovative technologies like blockchain and cryptocurrencies, the U.S. government first needs to understand it.Yang is referring to the Financial Services Committee, who questioned Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg for over six hours about the Libra Association and its planned Libra token. Yang said:“It’s embarrassing to see the ignorance some members of Congress display when talking about technology, and anyone who watched Congress question Mark Zuckerberg is well aware of this. Without a base level of understanding, it’s unreasonable to expect proper regulation of major tech companies, or the drafting of legislation that addresses the critical technological issues that we’ll continue to face in artificial intelligence and cybersecurity.”In August, Yang said that he plans implement blockchain-based mobile voting if he wins the 2020 United States presidential election, believing that American citizens should have the option of voting on a mobile device — with blockchain technology used for verification purposes."

Founded in 2014, the Bulgaria-based firm remains fully operational to date despite investigators’ allegations that it raised 4 billion euro ($4.4 billion) in a Ponzi scheme.“Cryptoqueen” Ignatova is the sister of OneCoin co-founder Konstantin Ignatov, who signed a guilty plea in connection with the alleged fraud on Oct. 4 and now faces up to 90 years in jail.Ignatova has been indicted on charges of money laundering and fraud but remains on the run. As Law360 reports, former Lock Lorde LLP attorney Mark Scott is currently standing trial for allegedly conspiring with Ignatova and her brother on OneCoin. He maintains that he believed the scheme was legal.Neil Bush, a businessman, had been interviewed by the FBI due to his role as a board member of Hoifu Energy, which is owned by wealthy Chinese businessman Dr. Hui Chi Ming. One of Dr. Ming’s companies is alleged to have pursued a $60 million loan to buy an African oil field and Scott’s counsel has subsequently argued that Bush’s indirect involvement with the deal contributed to Scott’s feeling confident enough to transact with those behind it.The oil field deal was to be financed in cash and ""a very large portion of the purchase price"" in OneCoin. Details of the FBI’s interview with Bush were heard at the trial, with Garvin stating:“Bush recalled that the head of Hoifu Energy, Dr. Hui Chi Ming, received a bunch of cryptocurrency for an oil deal in Madagascar. Bush had a residual interest in the cryptocurrency from the oil deal. Bush met the woman from the cryptocurrency company, Ruja Ignatova, in Hong Kong with Dr. Hui.""At the trial, Judge Ramos is reported to have asked Scott’s counsel David Garvin:""So, there was an actual meeting with Ms. Ignatova, Mr. Bush and Mr. Hui?""Garvin affirmed the meeting, noting that Bush was paid $300,000 for his participation. The FBI’s report allegedly noted that Hui had pledged Bush 10% of the sale if Hui was able to sell the cryptocurrency — yet the deal ultimately fell apart.The judge quashed calls for Bush himself to testify before the court, heeding the argument made by Bush’s counsel that it would not be relevant, given that Bush was not on the board of the specific Hui company involved in the sale. The judge further concurred that Bush’s testimony would not add anything further to what was already included in the FBI’s report. As reported, Ignatov testified on Nov. 6 that after his sister fled, the security personnel who accompanied her told him that she had met with Russian speakers. This has led investigative journalists to subsequently allege that she has the support and protection of an unnamed ""rich and powerful"" Russian person."

Large funds, venture capitalists and family offices in the U.S. need secure access to participate in the crypto market as global players. Binance.US is tilting the odds in their favor by offering Americans broader asset exposure.”In a move to further expand its offerings, Tagomi procured a BitLicense from the New York State Department of Financial Services in late March, which made it legally authorized to trade virtual currency assets and to engage in money transmission in the state.In September, Tagomi enabled its users to lend or borrow Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) to facilitate long or short trades. The exchange thus aims to make shorting easier by offering immediate access to multiple counterparties from a single platform.On Nov. 20, news broke that U.S.-based Trade Station — a subsidiary of Coincheck owner Monex Group — is launching a cryptocurrency brokerage platform via a newly-launched offshoot called Trade Station Crypto. The firm will provide crypto traders with access to aggregated, multiple liquidity pools, thereby improving price execution."

· #TradeSanta. Related News. Crypto Market Trading — Inside Look ...","Nov 22, 2019",A company providing cloud-based crypto trading software that enables transactions to be completed automatically has unveiled support for another crypto exchange.,"TradeSanta says its users can now connect to their Huobi accounts. The exchange is one of the world’s biggest in terms of trading volume — and reportedly serves 5 million clients in 130 countries, including the United States.Other leading exchanges including Binance, HitBTC, Bittrex, Upbit and Bitfinex are also supported by TradeSanta — with the likes of BitMEX and OKEx set to be added in the not-too-distant future.According to TradeSanta, there has been growing interest in its automation tools since the service launched back in November 2018. The software specializes in helping traders execute their strategies immediately and without the need for constant supervision.The company claims there are several advantages for traders who rely on automation. Firstly, orders can be placed up to 100 times faster than what would be possible if they were doing so manually. These tools can also remove emotion from trading decisions, enabling users to think about their strategies ahead of time and refrain from making impulsive orders that could cause them to lose more money. Last but not least, TradeSanta says its aim is to ensure that its community no longer needs to be constantly tethered to their PC or mobile at all times. With cryptocurrency markets remaining active 24 hours a day, seven days a week, automation provides an opportunity for traders to take a step back and tend to their other business interests, enjoy leisure time with loved ones or catch up on some much-needed sleep.TradeSanta says one of its main priorities has been ensuring that its software is easy for traders of all experience levels to use. Multiple tutorials are available so crypto enthusiasts can develop new skills and make the most of the program’s features, and an intuitive dashboard means that monitoring the performance of a bot is simple. These transparent analytics are also accompanied by handy Telegram notifications that alert traders whenever there have been significant market movements. In order to make the most of the vast array of cryptocurrencies on offer, traders these days normally have to go through the arduous process of registering with multiple exchanges. Although remembering all of these usernames and passwords can be difficult enough, mastering each and every interface can be nothing short of a nightmare. Using a TradeSanta trading bot helps to alleviate this problem by delivering a uniform interface and connecting to each of these exchanges through the use of API keys.TradeSanta claims that a new bot can be created in under five minutes by using one of its preset templates — and, as an alternative, seasoned traders can lovingly develop a customized strategy from scratch if they prefer. At the time of writing, the software boasted more than 17,800 active users and in excess of 5,000 trading bots, with 933,000 deals completed in total. Bots are effortlessly divided into active and inactive subsections, and the TradeSanta app provides an at-a-glance look as to whether bots are working successfully or need attention owing to an error.Four subscription tiers are available — including a free account that gives users up to two bots, an unlimited number of pairs, access to all trading strategies, Telegram notifications and on-demand support from customer services. Paid plans increase the number of bots that a trader can use simultaneously. The most expensive subscription, at $100 a month, provides an unlimited number of bots — with the added benefit of zero trading fees on the HitBTC exchange.Disclaimer.

Bitcoin developer, had been hired to work for OneCoin at one point.","Nov 10, 2019","With each passing day, the financial nitty-gritty associated with the cryptocurrency-related OneCoin Ponzi scheme continues to become of increasing interest to members of the global crypto community. ","The U.S. government’s previous estimate of the scam that raked in a total of $4 billion seems to be well off the mark, as the figure could be more than three to four times the official estimate — this is according to Jamie Bartlett, the person responsible for the BBC's podcast series The Missing Cryptoqueen. As part of the show, Bartlett and his team followed a trail of clues to track down Ruja Ignatova, who is widely credited as being the mastermind behind the entire OneCoin scam. Bartlett also uncovered a host of shocking documents during his research that revealed that OneCoin may have gathered more than $4 billion from just a single continent alone.To put things into context, it appears as though over the course of the fourth quarter of 2014 and the third quarter of 2016, OneCoin was able to generate a total of 3.4 billion euros (approximately $3.8 billion). However, since the coins had no intrinsic value attached to them, they could not be used to facilitate any real-world deals or purchases. Instead, the scheme relied solely on heavy marketing tactics and other nefarious ploys — such as Ignatov claiming that OneCoin Ltd. had successfully attracted more than three million members across the globe. However, at its core, the project was no different from any other multilevel marketing scheme, simply because, much like other MLM schemes, OneCoin too doled out handsome commissions to its members for on-boarding new recruits. Fast forward to 2019 and the aforementioned scam is currently being tried in front of a court of law. The prosecutors allege that Mark Scott, a U.S.-based attorney who had previously worked for reputed law firm Locke Lord LLP, helped Ignatov launder the bulk of the proceeds acquired through the OneCoin scam. Scott, who has pleaded not guilty, is being accused of employing a wide network of fake companies, offshore bank accounts and fraudulent investment schemes to siphon off more than $400 million in illegal proceeds. As compensation for his shady activities, prosecutor Julieta Lozano pointed out that Scott was paid handsomely in the form of a 57-foot yacht, three multimillion-dollar homes in Cape Cod, Massachusetts and luxury cars, including three Porsches and a Ferrari. To better understand the ongoing situation and how its potential outcome will pan out, Cointelegraph reached out to Matthew Russell Lee, founder of Inner City Press, which is known for its investigative journalism related to the global finance industry. Lee has been following the situation closely and has attended all of the recent hearings concerning OneCoin and the U.S. vs. Scott trial. When asked about Scott and his claim that he duly informed the FBI about his efforts to determine whether OneCoin might be a pyramid scheme before he got involved with the project, Lee replied:“Mark Scott's defense is that he didn't know that OneCoin, for example, had no blockchain. But his claims of not knowing that something was wrong are undercut by evidence he would only speak with Ruja Ignatova on a ‘crypto-phone’ and in some cases, only in person. Scott traveled to Sophia and, according to cooperating witness Konstantin Ignatov (Ruja's brother and, until her abrupt disappearance, personal assistant), met with Ruja with nearly all other OneCoin staff told to go home for the day not witness or overhead anything.”On the subject of Ruja Ignatov’s current whereabouts and how she has been able to evade various law enforcement agencies for so long, Lee told Cointelegraph an intriguing detail: Konstantin Ignatov testified on Nov. 6 that after his sister fled, security personnel who accompanied her told him that she had met with people who spoke Russian. Konstantin Ignatov also added that his sister informed him that she had the support and protection of a ""rich and powerful"" Russian individual.Despite all this information now being out in the public domain, the OneCoin project continues to remain fully operational. Even the project’s parent company, OneLife, continues to reiterate the mantra that ""OneCoin verifiably fulfills all criteria of the definition of a crypto-currency."" To make sense of this, Cointelegraph reached out to a Singapore-based crypto executive who claims to have inside knowledge on the matter but wishes to remain anonymous due to privacy concerns. According to the executive:“OneCoin has at various times, attempted to involve legitimate community players in creating a functioning blockchain for optics.”The executive also claimed that a lot of the market hype that OneCoin generated upon its release had crossed over to the Singapore scene and that Marcelo Carsil of Macenas, as well as an early Bitcoin developer, had been hired to work for OneCoin at one point.Lastly, Lee believes that the company’s ongoing operations are just a smokescreen to make it seem as though the project is still going ahead, as laid out in the original roadmap. He further highlighted that the mother of Ruja and Konstantin Ignatov still works at the OneCoin office in Sophia, Bulgaria. However, Lee expressed his doubts about OneCoin, saying, “I cannot imagine, given the evidence, how much longer this can continue.”Even though Scott is currently being tried in court in relation to a sizeable sum of $400 million, the larger question still remains: What happened to the rest of the money? It seems as though there has been little to no accountability as far as the entire score goes, but Lee believes that Ruja Ignatov — and perhaps her sponsors — took a lot of it. Additionally, he pointed out that as per a recent testimony, a man in the United Arab Emirates named Amer Abdulaziz, who is still free and makes routine public appearances, took around $100 million from the total stash. Lee concluded by saying:“I am particularly interested in the alleged money launderer(s) who were named in testimony on November 6, and other professional enablers some of whom have gone on to work on other crypto-currency projects.”"

Compliance",https://cointelegraph.com/news/ciphertrace-urges-crypto-companies-to-prepare-for-anti-money-laundering-compliance,"Since Bitcoin's rise to mainstream prominence in 2015, there has been 
increasing recognition of digital assets from government agencies ...","Nov 8, 2019","For better or for worse, the cryptocurrency space is coming of age. Since Bitcoin’s rise to mainstream prominence in 2015, there has been increasing recognition of digital assets from government agencies around the world. In turn, new regulations are being imposed to control the way cryptocurrency companies operate and do business globally. ","Most recently, the Financial Action Task Force issued new guidelines on how digital assets should be regulated. In order to raise awareness around these requirements, the blockchain security company CipherTrace hosted a conference and hackathon this week in San Francisco dedicated entirely to discussions on the FATF guidelines, also known as the “travel rule.”The travel rule requires regulators and Virtual Asset Service Providers, such as exchanges from various countries worldwide, to collect and share personal data during transactions. Much like the guidelines followed by traditional banks under the United States Bank Secrecy Act, the travel rule being enforced for crypto firms follow the same requirements as money transmitters do to record identifying information on all parties in fund transfers made between financial institutions.Yet, unlike traditional financial firms, many cryptocurrency exchanges do not capture personally identifiable information by default. Complying with the travel rule will therefore require significant shifts for businesses operating in the crypto space.“The new regulations coming from FATF will ultimately change the way crypto companies operate, requiring them to track not only their own customers’ transactions, but also where their customers are sending money to,” Dave Jevans, CEO of CipherTrace, told Cointelegraph.One of the main goals of the CipherTrace conference was to gather regulators, banks, crypto companies and programmers together to make sense of the new guidelines, and then build a solution that would allow organizations to easily comply with the FATF rules.“There are broad implications around privacy, identification of customers, how data works across various blockchains and privacy coins,” said Jevans. “We need to come up with solutions to ensure that companies can easily comply with these regulations, which is what we aim to achieve here.”Prior to working on a compliance solution at the hackathon, a number of panels highlighted the themes and main challenges surrounding the FATF regulations. While these rules are not yet legally binding — as the FATF said in a public statement in June that countries have until June 2020 to adopt the guidelines — a broad theme at the CipherTrace conference was that action must be taken immediately. The G-20 stated that it already uses the recommendations for anti-money laundering regulation of cryptocurrencies, so crypto companies that fail to comply with the new regulations are likely to face penalties.“The consequences for non-compliance could range from a slap on the wrist, to going to jail if a company violates the Bank Secrecy Act,” Carol Van Cleef, CEO of blockchain consulting firm Luminous Group, warned on stage during the legal requirements panel. “No matter how big or small a company is, each has obligations to fulfil under the law.”Although this may be the case, John Jefferies, CipherTrace’s chief financial analyst, pointed out that many companies operating in the cryptocurrency sphere have yet to comply with the new regulations.“Many U.S. exchanges may not yet be compliant, but they should be at this time,” Jefferies said. “Moving forward, when Binance or Coinbase completes a transaction for example, they need to send the sender recipient data at the same time with that transaction. Otherwise, they are not in compliance.”While most crypto companies are not yet compliant with the FATF regulations, Jevans, the CEO of CipherTrace, stressed the importance of getting everyone on the same page.“Education is the main challenge we have to tackle first,” he said. “We need to know what the FATF laws are, why we should care and what can happen if companies don’t comply.”The U.S. Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network emerging technology policy specialist, Carole House, explained the FATF guidelines during her keynote. She highlighted that the guidelines are designed to curb the use of cryptocurrencies for financial crimes by making crypto transactions more traceable, giving regulators increased visibility into both cross-border and domestic currency transfers.“Crypto companies need to comply with the virtual currency recommendations by the end of June 2020. We’ve already been involved with a number of people from the Digital Commerce Association to provide commentary around accomplishing this,” House stated.As the FATF regulations were brought to light, a number of challenges around ensuring compliance followed.For instance, the question of how the FATF guidelines would relate to privacy coins was a pressing issue. One of the stated goals of privacy coins such as Monero and Zcash is to ensure that users have anonymized transactions, so it is questionable how these could be compliant with the new regulations.During the privacy coin panel, Jack Gavigan, head of product and regulatory affairs at Zcash, asked, “Is compliance possible in relation to privacy coins?”Answering his own question, Gavigan stated his belief that compliance is indeed possible, as a number of privacy coins are already listed in U.S. exchanges regulated by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network.Even though this may be the case, understanding how to abide by the FATF regulations in a way that focuses on privacy while maintaining the decentralized ethos of cryptocurrency and blockchain remains a challenge.Jake Tarnow, a security software developer at CipherTrace, aimed to solve this problem during the hackathon. His team came up with an impressive solution that aims to keep data anonymous when information is being exchanged between Virtual Asset Service Providers.“If VASP A is trying to send data to VASP B, we need to know how this can be done in a way that none of the information is in the clear,” Tarnow told Cointelegraph.His solution entailed using a zk-SNARK — short for a “zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge” — a form of cryptography that allows one party to securely reveal that it possesses a piece of information, without actually exposing the information itself.“By using zk-SNARKs, VASPs can send this information in a bulletproof way, where no one else can pick that up and pull out their proprietary information,” explained Tarnow.During the hackathon, developers also worked closely with security software gurus to integrate the Travel Rule Information Sharing Architecture into their systems. CipherTrace announced the release of TRISA in September as an open-source, peer-to-peer design for cryptocurrency companies and blockchain projects to comply with the FATF regulations.TRISA is meant to provide secure, reliable delivery of personally identifiable information, or PII, to the correct VASP, eliminating a huge risk for exchanges. However, sharing PII is prone to spamming, a problem that developers at the CipherTrace hackathon aimed to solve.“Various backend systems managing PII are vulnerable to spamming, as spammers can get into these systems and start asking people to send PII,” explained Jefferies.Independent consultant Kenneth Kron and his team won first place in the hackathon for coming up with a solution that introduces PII tokens to prevent spamming in TRISA.“We want to solve the problem of PII spamming in TRISA by introducing PII tokens and KYC providers who can generate enhanced KYC tokens. If spammers are trying to capture personal information and get a hit, all they get back is a token in this case,” Kron told Cointelegraph.Overall, the CipherTrace conference and hackathon gathered a unique mix of individuals to discuss the future of cryptocurrency regulations. The discussions throughout the event demonstrated that action must be taken now to ensure that crypto companies are compliant with the FATF regulations by June 2020.“We gathered many tribes that do not typically interact, enabling experts from government, exchanges and privacy groups to understand each other’s diverse perspectives,” Jefferies told Cointelegraph after the conference. “The conversations instilled a sense of urgency in the community and TRISA, while creating an open-source path to meet these tight regulatory deadlines and defend privacy at the same time.”"

network are engaged in validating blocks rather than mining them.","Nov 22, 2019",The institutional asset custody arm of United States-based crypto exchange Coinbase has announced it is transitioning to an internationally-based staking service as of Nov. 21.,"In rolling out its staking services to a global investor base, Coinbase Custody appears to be leveraging its brand recognition to promote staking as a key emergent investment strategy for the blockchain and cryptocurrency space. The announcement states the custodian intends to offer all of its global clients “appropriate access to crypto first features like staking.”Coinbase Custody has been offering an institution-grade staking service for Tezos (XTZ) as of March 2019 — subject to jurisdictional eligibility requirements — with the company’s flagship exchange rolling out support for XTZ staking to U.S. clients earlier this month. Staking is specific to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchains and essentially allows network participants to passively earn a form of “interest” by depositing their tokens to both maintain the network and potentially earn rewards.As opposed to Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchains like Bitcoin, nodes in a PoS network are engaged in validating blocks rather than mining them. A deterministic algorithm selects block validators based on the number of tokens a given node has staked in their wallet — i.e. deposited as collateral in order to complete the addition of the next block to the chain.During the protracted crypto winter of 2018, staking was pitched as an investment “survival” strategy by crypto fund managers and analysts, with many emphasizing that HODLers going long may as well stake to reap the “interest.” Dissenting voices — among them Bloomberg’s Aaron Brown — have argued against the strategy’s long-term viability on the basis of the fundamental merits of PoW over PoS currencies when it comes to trust and security. The narrative that staking is set to have a major impact on the industry has recently been aired by top crypto exchange Binance’s research arm, whose report has looked at the impact of token lock-ups on liquidity and compared the potential risk-return profile of staking as a passive investment strategy vs. active trading. Binance has itself rolled out staking services this fall.As the Ethereum network gears up for its eventual transition to PoS-based Ethereum 2.0., a senior ConsenSys executive has recently revealed that Ethereum 2.0 validators can expect to earn from 4.6% to 10.3% as rewards for staking on an annual basis."

Its launch has been postponed several times, while allegations of corruption keep swirling around the still-uncompleted project. Though Mohanty didn’t speak specifically about Venice’s troubles, he was clear that blockchain can solve exactly these kinds of problems.Before the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP25) in December 2019 can mark the culmination of green technology discussions this year, different world leaders and prominent businessmen are sharing their vision for the possible future of the green economy. “I bet on sustainability,” said Mohanty. “Run green finance on blockchain.”"

As the first mover among blockchain ...","Nov 12, 2019",Blockchain development communities cultivate the healthy growth of an open-source software platform.,"“It takes a village to raise a child,” is a popular saying that emphasizes the role of a larger group to properly nurture and develop the youngest members of society.The same holds true for young businesses. Without the endorsement of its 16 million-plus backers, Kickstarter projects would not come to fruition. Twitter would surely not have evolved into one of the world’s most well-known social networking platforms without adoption from 330 million monthly active users.Community supporters are the lifeblood of emerging companies. So, it’s critical for companies to know how to respond to, and interact with, their communities. Whether made up of consumers, users or developers, brand advocates should be prioritized, engaged with, and listened to. For young businesses juggling many priorities, this can be a challenge.A defining quality of any endeavor’s success can often be measured in terms of support. Whether it is the capital of pioneers who first forged into an industry or the consumer adoption of a new good or service in the marketplace, without support, it would often not be possible for the ecosystem to grow beyond early adopters. As this applies to open-source blockchain products, the support of developers often represents the difference between success and mass adoption, and failure and obscurity.For the major role they play, blockchain developers are a sought-after commodity. Hired’s State of Software Engineers Report for 2019 shows a year-over-year 517% rise in global demand for blockchain engineers. The blockchain industry’s growth stems from this community’s diligence to test new releases and provide feedback. For up-and-coming enterprises, collaboration with developers has led to rapid growth for software and quick newcomer adoption. The blockchain industry owes its beginnings to a community of developers that supported  Bitcoin. As the first mover among blockchain technology platforms, Bitcoin’s proof-of-work and encryption mechanism laid the underpinnings from which many other open-source blockchain platforms would follow. A community of minds working together made this momentum possible, and the growing support of a diverse number of developers has resulted in a more thoroughly tested — and thereby robust — code base.As it expanded from a handful of developers running nodes scattered across the internet, blockchain technology blossomed into a more decentralized network of validators. Although it stemmed from relatively humble beginnings, there are now at least 9,493 reachable nodes in the Bitcoin network. The growing diversity of the teams working on the network’s infrastructure enriched the community. Open-source code made it possible for anyone to branch off and develop their own solutions. From this creative sandbox, other networks emerged, giving rise to an ecosystem of blockchain applications. Some examples of this can be seen with the launch of Ethereum in 2015 as well as that of EOSIO in 2018.Like any other constituent, the developer community needs to be nurtured and engaged with for long-lasting benefits. These might include the establishment of a dedicated “developer relations” team that engages with the developer community through events, developer resources and training materials.Developers thrive when they have access to the latest tools, educational frameworks and reference examples that improve the learning experience to continue building on blockchain software. In turn, developer feedback is taken into consideration by the core teams who engineer many of the open-source protocols that make blockchain applications work. This feedback becomes an outlet for community input on how platforms evolve to meet the needs of a rapidly growing user base. The results of this back-and-forth are often reflected in the open-source Github repositories behind various projects.The Bitcoin Core Github repository offers a solid example of how community support ultimately stimulates growth. As the code base grew, a lack of formality in the coding style led to inconsistencies. To better manage input from a growing number of engineers, development guidelines were published that allowed for a more efficiently coordinated effort. This move simultaneously strengthened the community and Bitcoin Core’s code repository during a phase of growth.When open-source development communities have access to vast libraries of tools that simplify the building process, it makes it possible to more rapidly deploy projects. For Ethereum developers, a long list of open-source tools has been published to help developers get started. With numerous resources at their disposal, engineers have an easier time making their creative visions a reality. One example from my company, Block.one, is the release of a Contract Development Toolkit complete with a set of utilities designed to aid EOSIO developers as they build smart contracts. The toolkit lets developers process and compile C++ code to WASM binary code to be executed on the blockchain. It also contains a more advanced set of tools to customize smart contracts to meet maximum performance and efficiency criteria.Today’s blockchain development community spans multiple platforms. By tapping the collective community wisdom, software companies could solve some of the thorniest tech issues. When software architects offer their support, it becomes possible to harness the potential of a robust developer ecosystem. Building connections with communities at the start may yield global inputs to bring creative answers.Serg Metelin is the head of developer relations at Block.one. Originally from Ukraine, he was one of the early pioneers of social media applications for Eastern European social network VK.com. After moving to Australia in 2009, Serg worked with digital and marketing agencies and consultancies, delivering solutions for large Australian and international brands such as Disney, Electronic Arts, Woolworths and others. In 2015, he won a Westpac-sponsored Australian national competition, “Disrupt@Scale,” securing seed funding for his food delivery startup HowAboutEat, which he co-founded and served as the company’s chief technology officer."

SEBA will seek to attract clients from selected foreign jurisdictions starting in December.In a statement, SEBA CEO Guido Buhler emphasized that those opening an account with SEBA should be able to take full advantage of the digital asset sector’s potential without having to sacrifice security. He added:“We are proud to have founded a bank within 18 months, raised CHF 100 million [$100.5 million] in capital from investors and obtained a banking and securities dealer license.”As part of its account services, SEBA is offering a SEBAwallet app, e-banking services and SEBA card facilities, with support for five major cryptocurrencies: (BTC), Ether (ETH), Stellar (XLM), Litecoin (LTC) and Ether Classic (ETC). The bank provides investors with both crypto-crypto and crypto-fiat conversion services online and SEBA cards are supported at 42 million points of sale globally, paving the way for the “mass introduction of cryptocurrencies,” according to Buhler.Notably, SEBA is also rolling out enterprise accounts for blockchain firms and their employees, closing what it identifies as an important gap in the domestic sphere.As reported, fellow Swiss cryptocurrency bank Sygum — which was also issued a banking and securities dealer license from FINMA in August — has in parallel conducted negotiations with regulators to seal a banking license in Singapore.As a regulated institution, Sygnum equally aspires to roll out digital asset custody, brokerage and tokenization services for accredited investors and institutions."

to Tarbert. #Bitcoin · #Cryptocurrencies · #Government · #Bitcoin ...","Nov 22, 2019",The chairman of the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has called for “principles-based regulation” for cryptocurrencies. ,"Heath Tarbert, who assumed his post following former Chairman J. Christopher Giancarlo in July 2019, stated that taking such an approach in regulating digital assets would allow a period of development and observation before it may be appropriate to adopt more targeted rules. Tarbert delivered his remarks on crypto regulation in an op-ed published on the CFTC website Nov. 19.In the statement, Tarbert emphasized that the term “principles-based regulation” does not imply a light-touch approach or deregulation, stating that it is actually “far from it.” The chairman elaborated that such an approach involves moving away from detailed rules to relying more on high-level and “broadly-stated principles” to define standards for regulated firms and products.To make his point, Tarbert quoted former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill’s statement, “If you make 10,000 regulations, you destroy all respect for the law.” According to the chairman, regulators should first fully understand the outcomes and potential risks of digital assets before enforcing their rules. “What we don’t want to do is take a heavy hand and snuff out innovation altogether,” Tarbert argued, explaining:“Given the rapid pace of innovation and the markets supporting it, taking a principles-based approach to regulating digital assets and other fintech products would permit a period of development and observation. After we fully understand the outcomes and potential risks of digital assets, it may be appropriate to adopt more tailored and targeted rules, or a more balanced combination of principles and rules.”While expressing a supportive stance to the development of the nascent technology, Tarbert still devoted considerable attention to the risks associated with the industry. “Our willingness to allow innovation to develop should not be confused with a tolerance of fraudulent behavior or a so-called light-touch approach,” the executive stated. According to Tarbert, digital assets face unique operational risks such as fraud and hacks that could lead to theft or losses.He added that the CFTC is now considering how the basic aspects of principles-based regulation can be applied to crypto exchanges and clearinghouses.Tarbert’s new pro-industry remarks echo those of his predecessor, former Chairman Giancarlo. In September 2018, Commodity argued that crypto needs a “do no harm” approach from regulators to flourish, comparing the industry with the early days of the Internet.In late October 2019, the commission granted its fintech research unit LabCFTC status as an independent operating office. Following the elevation, the CFTC’s fintech hub started reporting directly to Tarbert."

Cointelegraph has you covered with some key highlights of BlockShow Asia 2019 held Nov. 14-15 in Singapore. ,"Cointelegraph moderated the first crypto media gathering as BlockShow hosted well-known personalities from the cryptocurrency industry, such as Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, also known as CZ, and Hyperledger Vice President APAC Julian Gordon.Cointelegraph also took the occasion to announce the launch of a new consulting division. Industry experts will lead the new initiative, which will focus on expanding enterprise adoption of blockchain technology.Zhao shared his perspectives on China’s central bank digital currency. He expects the system will be a blockchain-based version of the Renminbi that will help expand the currency’s economic influence:“The Chinese government wants to push RMB’s influence globally. They want RMB to be competitive with the US dollar. In order to do that they really need to push this currency to have more freedom.”APAC vice president of open-source blockchain development project Hyperledger Julian Gordon shared how the pro-blockchain sentiment of the Chinese government affected him. He said:“Xi Jinping made that announcement 10 days ago. The reason I know that is because my phone is sitting on my desk — my WeChat started buzzing and hasn’t stopped since.”Overall, the experts at the event seemed to agree that while Bitcoin is just cryptocurrency, blockchain is a new connectivity framework. The speakers also held a panel titled “Collaboration in a Decentralized Ecosystem: Why Government And Corporations Need It,” which illustrated how blockchain technology is being used by governments.The participants explained that, besides Bitcoin, blockchain allows for ecosystem connectivity and information in a trustless, decentralized fashion. Vinay Mohan, Managing Director of ConsenSys Singapore, said:“We are talking here about an intermediate technology that connects different ecosystems providing a new form of governance.”During a panel focused on blockchain scalability, all the speakers agreed that people have to choose between scalability and decentralization. Co-founder of Litecoin Foundation Xinxi Wang said:“At Litecoin, we always choose decentralization and security over scalability. Unfortunately, we can’t do both, but we try to find something in the middle.”Da Hongfei, the founder of smart contract-supporting blockchain platform NEO, shared his views on the current state of the decentralized web during the event. The NEO founder highlighted the problems deriving from monopoly, centralization abuse and single points of failure, proposing decentralization as the solution, saying:“These standards should be transparent and decentralized. Data ownership should be given back to the users.”Worth noting, CZ first met Da Hongfei at a panel in Shanghai in 2014. Now, they again shared one stage at BlockShow Asia 2019.Meanwhile, Chief FinTech Officer at the Monetary Authority of Singapore Sopnendu Mohanty spoke about the importance of blockchain for the economy, highlighting its indispensability for the development of green finance. According to him, blockchain can enable the monitoring, measuring and financing of what he refers to as “green assets.”Talking about altcoins, VeChain founder Sunny Lu suggested that token value is mostly arbitrary. He said:“99% of a [token’s value] is linked to speculation, and not to the value that solution can bring to society. This causes many startups to waste a lot of time producing and 'selling' the token, failing to develop solutions for where they were initially focused.”Meanwhile, CEO and co-founder at Distributed Lab and author of “Blockchain and Decentralized Systems,” Dr. Pavel Kravchenko, shared his view that Bitcoin adoption by institutions may actually result in BTC price crashing. He said:“Bitcoin is censorship resistant money, the first in the world. I don’t believe in institutional adoption. If this happens, Bitcoin will become not censorship-resistant. Then it won’t have this feature anymore and will crash to zero.”On the other hand, during a panel titled “Unlocking Yield In Cryptocurrency Assets — Encouraging Institutions To Enter The Industry,” a number of crypto leaders shared their thoughts on how to make emerging fintech accessible to mainstream financial entities. Head of Business Development Asia for Cumberland Justin Chow, in the end, said what he believes is needed to onboard institutional players:“Custody, liquidity, and regulations are the top three petitions from institutional investors jumping into crypto.”While those in the crypto space mostly welcome regulation, Quoine co-founder Mike Kayamori cautioned:""Crypto is evolving, and the government can't try to regulate things it still doesn't understand. [...] I am still in favor of crypto regulation, but [it] needs to be done very carefully.”On Nov. 15, Blockstream CSO Samson Mow said that Tether (USDT) is clearly the preference among investors but will not see a retail use case during a panel called “The progress of stablecoins — if any? Can I use it yet?” Still, he noted that while Tether’s first mover advantage gave it a great advantage over competitors, he expects national cryptocurrencies to make stablecoins obsolete. He also noted:“Stablecoins are a mid-step toward hyperbitcoinization. They’re a temporary thing. The main threat they face is from the national cryptocurrencies. How open will those national cryptocurrencies be? [...] Stablecoins will then have no reason to exist with a national cryptocurrency.”BlockShow also saw SingularityNet’s CEO Ben Goertzel give a presentation titled “Stimulating Massive Network Effects in Decentralized AI Networks.” He spoke about the merging of blockchain with AI:“By definition, a blockchain is a distributed, decentralized, immutable ledger used to store encrypted data. On the other hand, AI is the engine or the ‘brain’ that will enable analytics and decision making from the data collected. But both AI and blockchain are in situations where they can benefit from each other, and help one another.”Goertzel also announced a new partnership between SingularityNet and PayPal. Finally, the show also hosted a startup competition called Crypto Busters with eight companies, after which the Board of Investors who judged the contest showed particular interest in six startups, namely Hacken, GamerHash, Chainstack, Keyless, Beatdapp and Holdex.BlockShow Asia 2019 was sponsored by dozens of cryptocurrency companies and entities, including Changelly, Bequant, Bluehelix, Crypto.com, Apay and NGC Ventures and NEO, which joined the exhibition with a unique format of the zone being represented by its ecosystem projects such as Higgs, Guardian Circle, Liquefy, Switcheo, OnchainCustodian, Novem, CryptoFast, Ontrade.It was an action-packed couple of days at BlockShow, but we finally got the Cointelegraph team together for a group photo"

The report indicated that police had restrained an additional $472,000 in cryptocurrency and $377,000 in banked funds from an associate in November.The CPRA is a civil-based process where a high court judge must decide whether someone has accumulated wealth and benefits through significant criminal activity. If this is found to be the case, the judge can grant the order to freeze and confiscate any assets in relation to the alleged criminal activities.In this case, New Zealand police suspect that the Hamilton-based McIvor is involved in money laundering, as he received millions of dollars from an illegal movie-streaming website he helped to create.Detective Senior Sergeant Keith Kay, the head of the Asset Recovery Unit in the Waikato, said his team became involved after a tip from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS), which had received suspicious activity reports from PayPal, which led tax officials to McIvor in New Zealand.The police reported told the New Zealand Herald that McIvor obtained roughly $2 million from the streaming site, which was allegedly deposited into his bank accounts from international wire transfers, PayPal, and Stripe. Kay further commented:""Introducing illicitly-obtained funds into New Zealand constitutes money laundering and police will thoroughly investigate and restrain the assets of those who undertake such activity [...] regardless of where in the world the crime is committed.""McIvor’s lawyer, Hamilton barrister Truc Tran, said that his client is denying the allegations of money laundering."

With the acquisition, Cypherpunk’s chief investment officer Moe Adham became a member of zkSnacks' board of directors. Cypherpunk’s president and CEO, Dominic Frisby, said: ""It's taken a lot of work and several months to get this deal over the line, so I would like to both thank and congratulate everyone involved. We have been most impressed with the Wasabi product and with the growth zkSnacks has displayed. We also believe its role in restoring fungibility to bitcoin will be vital.”In a presentation to investors published on Nov. 20, Cypherpunk pointed out a number of its other recent investments, which included a $100,000 contribution to privacy-centric Bitcoin (BTC) wallet Samourai Wallet, a $300,000 investment into decentralized open source blockchain project Chia, and Swedish Hydro66 datacenter, providing services to cloud providers and cryptocurrency miners.As blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis reported in late August, Wasabi Wallet had mixed a total of $250 million in Bitcoin in 2019, seeing a significant rise in volume since January. The firm indicated that the majority of funds sent to cryptocurrency mixing services or tumblers were primarily used for privacy purposes rather than for illicit activities.In July, the official Samourai Wallet Telegram account raised concerns over an alleged lack of privacy ensured by the CoinJoin implementation of competing wallet Wasabi. According to Samourai Wallet, Wasabi wallet CoinJoin transactions are often not as private as they are purported to be. The company pointed out:“With Wasabi if you are mixing 10 BTC, I can trivially track that 10 BTC as it is peeled down into smaller UTXOS (unspent funds). [...] Additionally Wasabi outputs are in the order in which they are registered, allowing you to make educated guesses that cluster outputs that you can later cross reference when inputs are inevitably merged to make a spend.”"

CAAA’s representative director Ji Komiya said, “I want to connect to new activities to promote the spread of virtual currency.”Specifically, the organization promotes crypto asset adoption by antiquarian merchants, who sell second-hand rare goods for cryptocurrency.A well-known Japanese cryptocurrency trader, Kazuma “Kazmax” Yoshizawa, was arrested for allegedly violating the Narcotics Control Law on Nov. 11.Law enforcement reportedly asked Yoshizawa to provide a sample of his urine and he tested positive for the use of the synthetic drug MDMA. He denies the accusations and claims that the drug was mixed into his drink in a club.Stellar (XLM) was listed on Japanese cryptocurrency exchange Coincheck on Nov. 12. Cointelegraph Japan reported that the price of XLM on Coincheck soared by 46% following the listing. The trading platform also announced that it will grant to its users 28 million XLM tokens in an airdrop.The company received the tokens two years ago from the Stellar Foundation and intends to give them away to its users next year. The users targeted in the airdrop were Bitcoin holders as of June 2017, and Coincheck received the coins by holding BTC for its clients.The University of Kyoto is now maintaining a transaction validator for Ripple’s XRP Ledger. This is reportedly the first blockchain validation operation by a Japanese University so far. A validator on the XRP is a node that validates — hence the name — transactions and consequently secures the network. Ripple senior director Emi Yoshikawa announced:“In the same way that the Internet has spread to the roots of the network to connect university networks and became the basis of a stable network, a neutral university organization has become a validator in the blockchain. I think it is very important to be the core of a healthy and healthy network.”"

refund based on transactions involving Bitcoin (BTC) he obtained in 2011.","Nov 20, 2019",The United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has argued that its summons on major American crypto exchange Coinbase is indeed legitimate in a recent filing.,"Per a Nov. 15 filing, the U.S. tax agency told a California federal court that its investigation of Coinbase customer William Zietzke is completely legitimate. Zietzke is attempting to quash the summons issued to Coinbase Inc. in June, which requested that they hand over his financial records pertaining to his 2016 return. Zietzke claimed that the IRS’s summons was too broad of a request, as it was not restricted to the 2016 tax year only. He added that the IRS wanted to obtain records that could compromise his financial and personal security if lost by the government.However, the IRS was not impressed and said in a filing that the Washington resident was unable to show any reason why the summons should not be enforced. The IRS also laughed off Zietzke’s vague allegations, where he insinuated that the tax agency is developing a database, so they can track anyone who owns virtual currency accounts. In the filing, the agency wrote:“Rather than allow the IRS to summon the information it needs from Coinbase, Mr. Zietzke invents an IRS surveillance conspiracy and argues that the IRS has all the relevant information it needs to determine whether he is entitled to the refund he claims − that is the limited, sometimes redacted, and ever changing information he has provided.”The IRS added:“By the summons at issue, the IRS seeks information to do exactly what Congress charged it to do: make an accurate determination of Mr. Zietzke's tax liability.”The IRS further explained that records beyond 2016 were necessary to determine his tax liability because Zietzke claimed a refund based on transactions involving Bitcoin (BTC) he obtained in 2011.In November, the Democratic 2020 presidential candidate Andrew Yang promised to promote legislation on the crypto asset market space by defining what a token is, when a token is a security, and equally important, clarify the tax implications of owning, selling, and trading digital assets, among others.Back in June, the U.S. Congressman (R-N.C.) Ted Budd testified to the House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee on issues with current tax laws on cryptocurrencies, arguing that the industry needs clear tax regulations."

its General Fund, sparking a bizarre rumor that the generous soul ...","Nov 19, 2019",The developers of privacy-centric cryptocurrency Grin (GRIN) have hit back at the fundamental claims of an article purporting to have “broken” the coin’s privacy model.,"In a Medium blog post published on Nov. 19, Grin core dev Daniel Lehnberg argued that the so-called breakage did not go beyond the already-acknowledged privacy limitations of the coin’s protocol and relied on a passive attack vector that would be insufficient to glean actionable data.Lehnberg’s post does not consist of a point-by-point takedown of the original article, which was published yesterday by Ivan Bogatyy, a researcher at United States-based Dragonfly Capital Partners. Instead, it targets what it deems to be the purportedly unsubstantiated logical leaps and factual inaccuracies used by Bogatyy to corroborate his claim. As previously reported, Grin’s protocol “Mimblewimble” is a variant of the cryptographic protocol known as Confidential Transactions, which uses cryptographic primitives known as “Pedersen commitments.” These obfuscate sensitive transaction data rather than showing plaintext transaction values and can, therefore, prevent double-spending while improving privacy. They allow for the use of basic arithmetic using public parameters to validate transactions, while the correspondent transaction input and output values remain unknown variables.The protocol notably does not use wallet addresses or public keys, only inputs and outputs. Because of this, each sender must contact a receiver via a private channel in order to construct a transaction.As outlined in Cointelegraph’s coverage yesterday, Bogatyy had focused on the use of a default, supplemental feature to MimbleWimble called CoinJoin, which creates small “anonymity sets” by combining encrypted inputs into a single large transaction in such a way as to make it is difficult to distinguish which inputs are paying which outputs. Bogatyy also claimed to have conducted a successful “attack” on a supplemental feature called “Dandelion” that is used by Grin to reduce the chance of so-called “spy nodes” recording transactions before cut-through, while they are still in an unconfirmed transaction pool (or “mempool”). While the limitations of Grin’s overall privacy model — which is significantly more complex than space permits to outline here — are known, Lehnberg’s critique of Bogatyy’s research rests on what he judges to be key “inconsistencies.”These include the implication that it would be possible for law enforcement to link intercepted data to a user address — when, as Lehnberg states, addresses do not exist within Grin’s privacy model at all. He adds: “We have to assume that the author conveniently confused transaction outputs (TXOs) with addresses, but these are not the same. And, as we’ve already detailed, the fact that TXOs can be linked is hardly news.”Lehnberg’s critique of Bogatyy’s claims continues to address several further points, with his central line of argument — details aside — resting on the statement that:“The Grin team has consistently acknowledged that Grin’s privacy is far from perfect. While transaction linkability is a limitation that we’re looking to mitigate as part of our goal of ever-improving privacy, it does not ‘break’ Mimblewimble nor is it anywhere close to being so fundamental as to render it or Grin’s privacy features useless.”As reported, Grin underwent its first network hard-fork this summer to introduce tweaks to its consensus algorithm in order to achieve greater resistance to ASIC miners.In October, the Litecoin Foundation published two new draft proposals that pave the way toward integrating MimbleWimble in order to establish privacy features for the Litecoin (LTC) network.Earlier this month, Grin received an anonymous 50 Bitcoin (BTC) donation to its General Fund, sparking a bizarre rumor that the generous soul behind it was Satoshi."

In parallel, videos and curriculum materials will be freely accessible online.A16z has stressed it will not take any equity from participants in the educational initiative but rather aims to accelerate the development of existing blockchain-focused projects as well as to encourage more talent to join the sector.A selection of experienced entrepreneurs and technologists will coach students in areas such as product and technology design, organization development, go-to-market strategy and legal/regulatory best practices.A16z outlines that, as is common to any new computing environment or technology:“Blockchains have endured a variety of challenges, false starts, and misconceptions. Some of the challenges are technical (e.g., scalability), some are product related (e.g., user experience), but many are due to the lack of widespread understanding of the technology’s capabilities, and the best practices required to take it mainstream.”As reported earlier this month, France is about to introduce an educational module to its high school curriculum that covers Bitcoin (BTC) and cryptocurrencies.In February of this year, Ripple unveiled the latest new partners in its global University Blockchain Research Initiative, including universities from the United States, China, Singapore and Brazil. As distinct from a16z’s industry and venture capital-sector initiative, many higher education institutions globally have launched their own internal blockchain laboratories, research centers and degree programs and certificates — including MIT in the U.S. and the IT University of Copenhagen.Initiatives that count corporate funding from the crypto sphere include Stanford’s Blockchain Research Center — whose sponsors include the Ethereum Foundation and Polychain Capital."

The BCT subsequently denied the reports, clarifying that it was exploring various methods of digital payment alternatives, including a possible central bank digital currency, but it had not moved forward with its implementation.In China, the People’s Bank of China announced that it will use a new system to certify 11 types of fintech hardware and software products relating to digital payments. The PBoC stated that, in order to obtain a corresponding certificate from the central bank, applicants will have to pass a prototype examination as well as on-site inspections."

Based on this data, the contract then makes mutual payments to the parties to settle the deal automatically.Sberbank notes that its solution covers the repo lifecycle end-to-end, which it claims eliminates counterparty risk and, in doing so, could translate into more affordable financing.Sberbank has actively pursued blockchain development in various aspects of its business but has stopped short of offering cryptocurrency-related services.In May 2019, Cointelegraph reported that the bank had halted its potential cryptocurrency trading plans because the Central Bank of Russia is still largely opposed to the adoption of the crypto space. At the time, Sberbank vice president Andrey Shemetov said that the bank is waiting for decisive cryptocurrency legislation to be adopted before moving ahead with more serious plans. In June, Sberbank CEO Herman Gref confirmed the bank’s choice not to develop cryptocurrency-related offerings, noting the institution was focused on developing blockchain solutions for financial services."

In its analysis, Elliptic conducts ongoing dark web research, identification of money laundering patterns, and collects data that links XRP accounts to known entities.Recently, blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis launched alerts for suspicious transactions across 15 major cryptocurrencies. The tool is meant to help cryptocurrency exchanges and other financial institutions mitigate their regulatory and reputational risks.Although crypto companies generally try to incentivize network integrity by setting up bounty programs that reward so-called white-hack hackers for exposing vulnerabilities, some industry members like John McAfee argue that authorities should not require cryptocurrency companies and trading platforms to help them control digital currency use in illicit activities. "

It will take a closer look at the real estate industry in Xingtai City, the medical industry records of Qinhuangdao City, large-scale cash withdrawals, and automobile sales industries in Zhejiang Province. PBOC staff reportedly said:“Under the requirements of large-scale cash management, banks need to deepen their understanding of current customers, strengthen risk warning and information communication for customers who are prone to generate large cash transactions, and guide them to use non-cash payment tools.” According to Dovey Wan, founding partner at global crypto asset holding company Primitive Ventures, the introduction of the restriction pilot paves the way for the upcoming digital Renminbi token (RMB).Although details of this digital currency are not officially known, it will certainly not be as decentralized as Bitcoin (BTC) as it will be issued by the central bank. Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, better known as CZ, who spoke at BlockShow Asia 2019, predicted that the digital RMB would be based on blockchain. He explained his reasoning: “The Chinese government wants to push RMB’s influence globally. They want RMB to be competitive with the US dollar. In order to do that they really need to push this currency to have more freedom.”In an effort to quell rumors to the contrary, a senior official from the People’s Bank of China said that China is not launching a war on cash by introducing its own digital currency.

Blockchain News · Business News · Technology News · Policy & ...","Nov 23, 2019","On Nov. 21, the United States Congressional Task Force on Financial Technologies held a hearing on the role of big data in financial services. ","The last major legislation focused on the subject was the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, which formalized a financial service firm’s obligations to clients — specifically, how they share client information. Given the field’s expansion over the past 20 years, the Fintech Task Force’s posture on Thursday was that of an early exploration of options and opportunities for new and major legislation. Obviously, the scene has changed remarkably since 1999. Financial services are more accessible than ever. Smartphones and powerful free apps have put financial capabilities previously reserved for industry professionals literally into the hands of everyday consumers. The flip side, as the task force seemed to acknowledge, is that many of those financial opportunities approach consumer data predatorily. The old axiom “if you are not paying for the product, the product is you” seemed to frame the conversation.While the public eye was largely directed at the ongoing Trump impeachment hearings the same day, the members of the Fintech Task Force — led by chairman Stephen Lynch (D-MA) and ranking member Tom Emmer (R-MN) — questioned five expert witnesses who testified as to the state of the industry and appropriate measures to rein in big tech.The witnesses espoused a range of views reflective of highly distinct professional backgrounds. Lauren Saunders, an associate director at the National Consumer Law Center, focused on minimizing firms’ legal right to use consumer data in ways beyond those that users would reasonably expect. She also expressed concern about the ways that machine learning was amplifying discriminatory financial practices in ways that would be harder to correct than in traditional systems. An associate professor of computer science at Brown University and chief scientist at Aroki Systems, Dr. Seny Kamara also believed that firms were running rampant over consumer rights. A cryptographer, Kamara showed a unique insight into ways that technology itself could limit financial service providers’ access to consumer data. He cautioned, however, against excess hope in the field, saying “It is easy to get carried away on a wave of technological optimism.”Like Saunders, Dr. Christopher Gillard, an English professor at Macomb Community College and an advisor to the Digital Pedagogy Lab, was extremely concerned about the role of new technologies in reinforcing old discrimination. He referred to “opaque systems that offer consumers little power of redress” in the form of practices hidden from consumers under the auspices of proprietary code. Gillard further affirmed that “We must reject the notion that regulations stifle innovation.”More optimistic in tone, Don Cardinal, managing director of the Financial Data Exchange (FDX), pointed to industry moves away from data practices like screen-scraping, in which customer login information is accessible to aggregators. He saw the industry as addressing the problems preemptively.Similarly, Duane Pozza, a partner at law firm Wiley Rein, sought to define the concept of big data and emphasize its role in expanding financial services. He was particularly interested in cash-flow data, which Saunders had called out as a potential major overstep when it allows loan providers to access data on merchants and specific purchases rather than vaguer information on overall balances and transfers. Saunders said that such data enabled profiling and discrimination on a major and distopian scale. Pozza saw cash-flow data as a means of freeing credit seekers from the traditional gatekeepers of credit scores. Though traditional party lines did come into play, with Republicans making slightly more mention of consumer choice and Democrats more frequently bringing up consumer protection, the assembled congresspeople all seemed to be in alignment that consumers had little choice and were unprotected. Chairman Lynch described the contracts users must agree to in order to access services: “Framed as privacy agreements, they’re actually lack-of-privacy agreements.” Lynch specifically called out the agreements of Mint, Venmo and Qapital, which according to him were, respectively 30, 40 and 10 pages long and filled with language that Lynch, an attorney, described as dense legalese. The consensus was that such problems are inescapable, with Rep. Ben McAdams (D-UT) opining that, as a consumer, he has no idea how many firms are using his data right now.The shared atmosphere in the room was that consumers were being failed. It was a rare moment of consensus, with the major exception of witness Don Cardinal, who was frequently quick to point out how much progress the field has seen in recent years, as well as how much financial access has expanded to new demographics thanks to innovative companies. As always, solutions are trickier. Many members leaned into the prospect of more comprehensive legislation, along the lines of the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, or laws passed in recent years in California and New York — traditionally, the tech and finance capitals of the U.S., respectively. Instances of massive financial data breaches including Equifax and Capital One loomed large over the proceedings. The bulk of the hearing presumed the need to enact legislation in response to the clear failure of financial institutions to meet due diligence in protecting these treasure troves of customer information of the most sensitive natureNew York’s regulation 23 NYCRR 500 placed new burdens on cybersecurity for companies handling client financial data. It took effect on March 1, 2017, but has less to do with limiting the amount of customer data that a firm can access than with establishing requirements for the cybersecurity surrounding that data. On March 1, 2019, what is perhaps the most ambitious element of the regulation was the last to come into play. This final requirement obliges financial services companies to examine and issue reports on the cybersecurity effectiveness of third-party services that also have access to the data collected by the primary firms.Passed in September 2018, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) will come into effect at the beginning of 2020. Given the portion of U.S. tech firms that are registered in the state, California’s status as the most-populous of the United States, as well as the law’s broad prescriptions for any action in any jurisdiction taken by firms operating in California, the CCPA will likely serve as either Congress’s template or cautionary tale for legislation on data privacy for years to come. Expect all eyes to be on its impacts on firms and its effectiveness at protecting consumers once the new year comes. It was, however, clear throughout the proceedings that many of the legislators involved lacked technical expertise. Ranking Member Emmer commented on this after the hearing, telling Cointelegraph that there was clearly a “steep learning curve that a lot of people in Congress have when it comes to this type of technology.” He continued: “This body tends to look like the people that you saw up here today as opposed to young people who are writing code, on the edge and always pushing into this new universe.”As Dr. Kamara pointed out during questioning, “Services can be provided without having to give up data.” He continued: “We can minimize the amount of data collected down to 0 if we invest in the right technology.” Cointelegraph got the chance to follow up with Kamara on the subject after the hearing, during which time he highlighted the availability of technology “that allows us to process data without ever seeing it. So you can hold your data, you don’t ever have to release it to anybody, but I can still compute on your data and get some kind of signal from it.” When Cointelegraph asked him about zero-knowledge proofs as an example, Kamara responded that “you can do similar things for computation as well. So not just proving identity, or proving knowledge of something, but computing as well.” It was, however, clear throughout the hearing that Dr. Kamara was not suggesting that financial services providers be left to enact such technological practices out of the goodness of their hearts. In response to a question from Chairman Lynch as to why consumers were still vulnerable, Kamara answered: “Because companies never had any incentive to improve their privacy practices, they have never been invested in.”Among other promising technological advances that received mention during the hearing were new application programming interfaces, or APIs. Don Cardinal, in particular, saw these mechanisms as providing built-in filtration, restricting the information available to companies to what is relevant to their particular line of work. Cardinal, whose work at Financial Data Exchange involves implementing FDX’s API, showed a particularly rosey outlook on the industry’s willingness to change its own practices internally. FDX’s press release on the event of the hearing featured the tagline “Industry Proves Quick to Adopt Secure Data Sharing Standard – Over Five Million U.S. Consumers on FDX API.”Thursday’s hearing left little doubt that major federal legislation governing data usage is coming in the United States. Democrat outrage over new financial data practices targeting vulnerable groups through predatory lending and discriminatory algorithms met with Republican frustration with the obvious inability of even the most savvy of consumers to cope with the ways that their data are being manipulated beyond their control. Unless some improbably ambitious initiatives from both the private sector and existing regulators — especially the Federal Trade Commission — come into play to prune the overgrowth of customer data in the possession of fintech firms in advance, that legislation will be sweeping.However, do not expect legislation yet. Congress is going to wait until they can assess the new California law as a case study, and then larger committees are going to need to get up to speed with the work of Fintech Task Force, which is still a young and small wing of the Financial Services Committee. Meanwhile, stay tuned."

The Future of ...","Nov 10, 2019","IDEX, the decentralized exchange (DEX) responsible for over 40% of all DEX transactions, claims to have created an “infinite scaling solution” for the Ethereum network.","In an email sent to Cointelegraph, IDEX claims that its system, dubbed Optimized Optimistic Rollups (O2Rs), reaches block finality in 10 minutes. The company also says that this is about 1,000 times faster than the Optimistic Rollups (ORs) developed by Ethereum scalability development organization Plasma Group — which achieves block finality in two weeks.Rollup solutions scale by moving computation off-chain and pushing result to the network later. Both O2Rs and ORs ensure data legitimacy by having validators analyze the data published on-chain.This technology offers a spectrum of use cases. The difference between the two protocols is that O2Rs only publish the data off-chain unless a validator triggers a data availability check. Thanks to this change, the new system reportedly has limitless scalability potential, and can handle much more complex applications.IDEX CEO Alex Wearn suggested in a tweet published on Nov. 6 that point of sale payment systems could use O2Rs in a scalable non-custodial payments service “that can match the throughput of Visa.” He also suggested that the solution would allow for free, instantaneous transfers of video game assets digitized as non-fungible tokens.Scalability is one of the main obstacles to blockchain adoption, as blockchains currently tend to increase transaction prices or stop processing them altogether when under heavy use. As Cointelegraph reported earlier today, the EOS blockchain is currently congested by the EIDOS token airdrop."

In the announcement, the team notes that the hash of the binaries available for download did not match the expected hashes.On GitHub, a professional investigator going by the name of Serhack said that the software distributed after the server was compromised is indeed malicious, stating:“I can confirm that the malicious binary is stealing coins. Roughly 9 hours after I ran the binary a single transaction drained the wallet. I downloaded the build yesterday around 6pm Pacific time.”Hashes are non-reversible mathematical functions which, in this case, are used to generate an alphanumeric string from a file that would have been different if someone was to make changes to the file.It is a popular practice in the open-source community to save the hash generated from software available for download and keep it on a separate server. Thanks to this measure, users are able to generate a hash from the file they downloaded and check it against the expected one.If the hash generated from the downloaded file is different, then it is likely that the version distributed by the server has been replaced — possibly with a malicious variant. The Reddit announcement reads:“It appears the box has been indeed compromised and different CLI binaries served for 35 minutes. Downloads are now served from a safe fallback source. [...] If you downloaded binaries in the last 24h, and did not check the integrity of the files, do it immediately. If the hashes do not match, do NOT run what you downloaded.”In general, blockchain development communities are vigilant in tracking possible vulnerabilities and maintaining network integrity.In mid-September, the developer of Ethereum decentralized exchange protocol AirSwap’s developers announced a different important development for their project’s security. More precisely, they revealed the discovery of a critical vulnerability in the system’s new smart contract.In order to incentivize network integrity, some organizations have founded bounty programs that reward so-called white-hack hackers for exposing vulnerabilities."

Moreover, those users whose balance is below the minimum withdrawal amount in the wallet will not be able to withdraw, and the exchange may require its users to undergo additional identification procedures in order to get back their funds.Bittrex is not the only cryptocurrency trading platform that deactivated its Iranian users’ accounts. In late May, peer-to-peer cryptocurrency exchange LocalBitcoins banned users living in Iran, citing compliance with financial regulations in Finland, where LocalBitcoins is based.Crypto exchanges Coinbase and Binance also do not currently support users based in Iran.In mid-October, Bittrex International, the Malta-based international unit of Bittrex, announced that it will cease operations in Venezuela and 30 other countries.

It went live for trading on Nov. 5.According to an overview of the instrument, the ETP’s investment objective is both to provide exposure to the performance of Tezos while generating additional yield for investors through so-called “baking rewards.”Similarly to other proof-of-stake (PoS)-based blockchains, Tezos investors are able to passively earn a form of “interest” by staking — depositing — their tokens to both maintain the network and earn rewards. “Baking” — a term specific to Tezos — enables stakeholders to participate in the staking and governance process by delegating their coins to a delegation service of their choice. Once delegated, these holdings are set in correlation with the total staking balance of the service, with rewards paid out accordingly once they have been released by the network.According to Amun, the firm will charge a 2.5% fee on proceeds from the Amun Tezos ETP.Underlying assets are reportedly secured and managed using Coinbase’s institution-grade Custody Platform and Amun says it holds 100% of the value of these assets in cold storage.This October, crypto broker Bitcoin Suisse partnered with Amun to launch a new Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH)-based ETP on the SIX exchange.Amun AG now has a total of nine cryptocurrency ETP products listed on SIX, including an XRP-based ETP, among others. A recent research report from crypto exchange Binance  argued that with Ethereum’s expected switch to PoS, staking is poised to have a transformative impact on the crypto industry. The largest 10 crypto assets currently supporting — or due to support —  staking cumulatively represent a market capitalization of $25.8 billion, meaning that prospective staking dominance stands at roughly 10% of the total industry market capitalization."

Douglas Gan, CEO of BCB Blockchain, said:“By providing DOST, universities and TBIs the resources and technical knowledge that BCB Blockchain has, we expect them to deepen their competencies in the area of designing and developing applications and projects for smart cities. We will guide and provide them the access to hands-on workshops, funding, materials, events and technical support.”This summer, the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) of the Philippines signed an MoA with United States-based blockchain firm Monsoon Blockchain Storage, wherein Monsoon was set to act as a blockchain consultant and advisor to DICT, offering services such as cost-benefit and socio-economic analyses regarding blockchain solutions in the Philippines.In the meantime, Philippine Senator Grace Poe said that local lawmakers should not be in a hurry to pass financial technology regulation. Poe stated:“To most of our countrymen, this is alien to them, but in fact some of them have been availing of it through online lending. And without the proper information and education, a lot of them are actually victimized.”"

This ostensibly makes it impossible to resell tickets for a competition multiple times.Ajax Life reporters note that if the blockchain pilot’s results are deemed successful, the solution will be developed and scaled further with the support of the European Regional Development Fund.Both KNVB and AFC Ajax were participants in developing a series of innovative products for trial implementation during yesterday’s match, under the aegis of a so-dubbed “Change the Game Challenge,” jointly initiated with the Johan Cruijff Arena.This October, Broadway’s largest ticket operator, the Shubert Organization, revealed plans to pilot an IBM blockchain-powered mobile ticketing solution and is eyeing integrating the product into its business in the future.In international soccer, blockchain platform Socios.com has partnered with numerous leading clubs — including French soccer club Paris Saint-Germain, Italy’s Juventus and London-based West Ham United — to launch club-branded fan tokens."

Google searches for terms like “Bitcoin” and “blockchain” skyrocketed in the last few years — alongside the spike in crypto prices. This suggests that people have a thirst for understanding more about how cryptocurrencies and blockchain work, and it is the job of the media to provide accurate information and market updates.","Nevertheless, gathering high-profile crypto journalists and media representatives under the same roof for a collaborative effort turns out to be quite a challenge in today’s competitive environment. Despite everything, Blockshow Asia 2019 managed to organize a panel called Medialogue, which gathered top journalists from major media agencies covering crypto as well as public relations representatives. The event, which took place on Wednesday, Nov. 13, in Singapore’s Oasis Hotel Downtown was moderated by Cointelegraph.The meeting featured several Cointelegraph journalists, including:The topics of the panel revolved around incidences of scam projects promoted throughout the media, as well as questions concerning revenue, which included topics such as advertising and sponsored content. Other topics related to the evolution of the crypto space from Bitcoin to an entire ecosystem of digital assets and also about the specific types of content covered in various regions. Attendees concluded that media is forced to rely on ads and sponsored content in order to thrive in such a fast-growing industry. However, this might be a double-edged sword when it comes to maintaining neutrality and providing real value to the community — which means due diligence is mandatory.Public relations managers also bare a high degree of responsibility, as they act as an important intermediary channel between crypto projects and media. The invitees debated the best ways that PR manager could share crypto stories with journalists, concluding that there were several justified approaches.Kristina Cornèr, Cointelegraph’s senior editor and head of features, expressed her thoughts about the value of such an event as the Medialogue:“Discussions are an essential part of our community. We are still at a very early stage in the blockchain industry, and that means cooperation between journalists is an indispensable feature for the further adoption of the technology. We should talk more about the challenges and issues, and about bringing quality journalism into the decentralized sector.”Interestingly, the audience suggested that the space needs a wire service, much like the Bloomberg Terminal, for the crypto industry."

These SIM cards can be bought on eBay and plugged into a burner phone. Once the phone number is transferred, the hacker can reset passwords for valuable and private services like cryptocurrency wallets and email accounts. Samy Tarazi, a sergeant at the Santa Clara County Sheriff’s office commented on the phenomena in October:“We’re talking about kids aged mainly between 19 and 22 being able to steal millions of dollars in cryptocurrencies [...] we’re now dealing with someone who buys a 99 cent SIM card off eBay, plugs it into a cheap burner phone, makes a call and steals millions of dollars. That’s pretty remarkable.”According to the indictment, the U.S. men targeted at least 10 victims throughout the country and allegedly stole, or attempted to steal, over $550,000 in cryptocurrency from these victims alone.  At the beginning of November, the Office of United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations and prosecutors for the Southern District of New York indicted a man for allegedly participating in a cryptocurrency scheme dubbed Igobit. He allegedly spent his clients’ funds on personal expenses, such as dinners at Manhattan restaurants, airline tickets and online shopping."

So are those companies who have been enjoying preferential government policies, which involve local electricity rates, land and taxes “by pretending to be a participant in the big data industry.”In September, it was reported that the local government issued a notice demanding a clean-up of the crypto mining firms. Five departments within Inner Mongolia felt the need to rectify the mining industry within the province, while the regulators’ position stated that “the virtual currency ‘mining’ industry belongs to the pseudo-financial innovation unrelated to the real economy, and should not be supported.”It remains unclear how this wave of new inspections will impact miners operating in Inner Mongolia. However, it seems that many who worked in the local crypto mining industry have already moved on to other countries. Yang Wang, a senior research fellow with the Fintech Institute of Renmin University of China, said:""Most people I knew who worked in the domestic crypto token industry have already shifted their businesses to Southeast Asian countries like Singapore. They felt that the crypto token market has come to an end in China.”China’s spending on blockchain technology will exceed $2 billion in 2023, according to a recent report, which claims that blockchain development in China will see a compound annual growth rate of 65.7% from 2018 to 2023.The report further pointed out that the bulk of China’s blockchain spending was geared to the banking sector in 2019.

Zaslavskiy pleaded guilty in November 2018 to conspiracy to commit securities fraud.Zaslavskiy made it seem as if the ICO was led by experienced real estate professionals, backed by United States property investments, luring in more than 1,000 investors who invested at least $300,000 in the scam ICO during the summer of 2017.

has been able to hack it.” No strategic plan. The Department of Defense, ...","Nov 9, 2019","When Indian Defense Minister Rajnath Singh said that blockchain and artificial intelligence would “revolutionize war,” as Cointelegraph reported on Nov. 4, did he take things a bit too far? Jet engines have revolutionized warfare, and so have missiles and nuclear weapons — but shared digital ledgers? ","Former NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen, for one, told Cointelegraph that he agrees with India’s minister when he was asked about blockchain’s possible military uses:“Yes, potentially. Digital technologies have been transforming warfare since the 1990’s so emerging technologies such as blockchain have the potential to define the war industry over the coming decades. Data and data sharing will be critical for warfare in the future, particularly with the development of artificial intelligence.”Rasmussen — former three-term prime minister of Denmark, current CEO of Rasmussen Global, and strategic advisor to the Swiss blockchain identity company Concordium — added:“Sharing data is fundamentally about transactions. Securing and sharing the right data in the right order between the right parties (computers, machines, defence agencies, and among allies) is critical in modern militaries and will only grow in importance in the future.”Blockchain technology will be critical in defending key weapons systems as well as validating orders and battlefield information, among other uses. This is according to what Victoria Adams, the government practice lead for ConsenSys in Washington, D.C., told Cointelegraph. She added that the Indian minister’s remarks regarding blockchain “may have been a bit of a stretch,” but that AI, by comparison, is going to “revolutionize everything.” Managing logistics and military supply chains will be a particular challenge, Adams said — especially as these become more privatized and complex with the addition of additive manufacturing (i.e., 3D printing). If the U.S. Marine Corps is going to put 3D printers in the field so that soldiers can manufacture spare parts on-site for F-35s, say, then it needs to protect these workstations from hackers — especially the digital specifications — Adams said.“The Pentagon has said it doesn’t want a single point attack vector,” Joel Neidig — CEO of Simba Chain, a smart contract startup working with the U.S. Air Force to provide a blockchain-based platform to secure the supply chain — told Cointelegraph. And this is where blockchain technology, with its thousands of nodes, can indeed be of help. If the supply chain is on a blockchain, one’s adversaries can no longer gain illicit entry through a single node or a single computer. According to Neidig, “They will have to take the whole network down, which isn’t so easy to do. Just think how resilient Bitcoin has been over the past 11 years. No one has been able to hack it.”The Department of Defense, and other U.S. security agencies, still doesn’t appear to have a clear, integrated strategy for incorporating blockchain into their operations, though use cases appear to be emerging piecemeal. In September, for instance, the Department of Homeland Security awarded $143,478 to Vienna-based firm Danube Tech to develop blockchain security solutions, including digital documents like passports and green cards to be used at border crossings or in airports. But according to what Markus Sabadello, the CEO of Danube Tech, told Cointelegraph, it isn’t far-fetched to see how a military organization could issue a digital identity for all its soldiers to establish their credentials, including their rank. Commanders could send orders through the decentralized digital network, and soldiers could verify who the message came from. The enemy would find it difficult to forge false identities, as all of them are registered on a blockchain, and there would be no one central server that the enemy could hack.Blockchain technology could also be used in military-related areas like arms negotiations, Rasmussen suggested: “One application that has been discussed is a so-called secure multi-party computation (MPC) which can be combined with blockchain so that a number of people can input information while keeping their individual inputs private. This is being discussed in the context of arms reduction and oversight agreements.”It all isn’t happening fast enough, though, in Adams’ view. “You go to defense conferences, and you speak about this, and you get a lot of blank stares.” Yes, there are military blockchain initiatives in the works, “but they are all pilots, testing, getting the face wet -- no energetic response.” Adams continued:“I don’t see a strong vibe from the NATO countries. By comparison, Russia, and China’s People’s Liberation Army have shown that they get this.” Several countries are making developments in this area.According to Deloitte’s 2019 Insight Global Blockchain Survey, China — more than any other country — will use blockchain “strategically instead of tactically,” according to Paul Sin, consulting partner at Deloitte Advisory. Moreover, 34% of Chinese respondents in the 2019 survey strongly believe in the disruptive potential of blockchain, more than most countries in the survey. Elsewhere, statements from China’s People's Liberation Army have caused some concern in the West. In a 2018 article, the PLA described how the technology behind Bitcoin could have military applications, including in its intelligence operations and in protecting weapon life-cycle data from cyberattacks. According to Jahara W. Matisek, assistant professor of military and strategic studies at the U.S. Air Force Academy, the journal article was written specifically as a call to action. He quoted the PLA directly in his article in the journal National Interest, which said, “If we do not take precautions in keeping with the pace of the times, we will be subject to control everywhere.” Matisek commented on the quote: “The PLA seems to recognize the importance of this emerging technological capability, but should China be allowed to control the future of information warfare?”More than two years ago, the Russian news service Tass announced that blockchain technology might soon be introduced into the Russian military, but noted: “We should be cautious when approaching new technologies, study them in detail because they always carry not only new advantages but also new unknown risks and threats.”In 2018, the Russian Defense Ministry announced it was launching a new research lab to study how blockchain could thwart cyberattacks. It hoped to build secure blockchain-based platforms to make it more difficult to hide traces of cyberattacks and track online intruders into its systems, according to Adams.In April, South Korea’s defense department announced a blockchain pilot program to prevent external tampering with its military supply chain. Kim Tae-gon, coordinator of the National Defense Agency, called blockchain technology “one of the core technologies of the 4th Industrial Revolution.” He added:“The history of the entire process from bidding, evaluation, and results for defense improvement projects will be recorded on the blockchain, enabling more transparent management of the company selection process.”India’s defense industry is undergoing “a churning to cope and employ these technologies, in order to safeguard the safety and security of critical infrastructure,” according to Defense Minister Rajnath Singh on Nov. 3, as reported by the Times of India. Meanwhile, scholars in India are concerned about blockchain supporting the conduct of military operations. According to Global Security Review, “With one author recognizing that as governments and individuals develop quantum computing abilities, blockchain will make it easy to hack into highly secure networks.”The U.S. Department of Defense — somewhat belatedly, perhaps — is recognizing the benefits of blockchain technology for national defense, noting in its July Digital Modernization Strategy 2019 report that its Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA, will study the technology. The report states: “DARPA is starting to experiment with blockchain to create a more efficient, robust, and secure platform using a blockchain protocol that will allow personnel from anywhere to transmit secure messages or process transactions that can be traced through numerous channels of a decentralized ledger.”The DoD referenced specific communications benefits, such as “facilitating communication between units and headquarters, and transmitting information between intelligence officers and the Pentagon.”But many of the use cases noted above appear to be individual initiatives of departments or services sectors (e.g., the U.S. Air Force), and these are early in the developmental process. The U.S. DHS initiative with Danube Tech, for instance, is still in its pilot stage, and Simba Chain’s project with the U.S. Air Force only recently passed into phase two. It will be several years before a solution will be implemented at scale, Neidig told Cointelegraph.NATO, as a political and military organization, needs to find ways of increasing investment across the alliance, as well as to cooperate more closely to develop new technologies like blockchain and AI, Rasmussen explained to Cointelegraph, adding:“We often hear President Trump talk of the need for NATO allies to spend 2 percent of GNI on defense. This was a target agreed at my last NATO summit. But we also should focus on another target – 20 percent – which is the amount that NATO allies should spend on equipment and R&D. I believe we should raise this to 30 percent across the whole alliance.”Not all concede that blockchain will revolutionize — or even impact — warfare in any meaningful way. DARPA, the DoD’s visionary agency, is supposed to anticipate the future, after all, whether it be the internet, driverless cars or the autonomous battlefield. On Nov. 19, 2019, DARPA issued a request for information on distributed consensus protocols to see how this technology might improve security, storage and computing in the Defense Department. According to C4ISRNET: Media for the Intelligence Age Military, such a request is “almost an indictment of the technology itself. If DARPA can’t figure out a responsible, value-generating use for blockchain, who can?” It won’t be easy to introduce decentralization (i.e., blockchain) into top-down, heavily centralized military organizations. Some military minds may be hesitant to give up control, even if the U.S. military has been encouraging more bottom-up initiatives in recent years. “Yes, it’s a problem,” Adams said. “You gain control by giving up control. It’s hard to do.

Cointelegraph YouTube Subscribe ...,"Nov 20, 2019","Tel Aviv-based media outlet BLOCKTV announced details of a tokenized rewards system to incentivize sources to share exclusive news tips. This comes after BLOCKTV revealed that its native token, BLTV, would be listed on the Bittrex Global exchange on Nov. 21.","BLOCKTV CEO Aviram Elad told Cointelegraph:“We see the BLTV token as a solution to fix a broken business model in the media industry. The token aims to empower an upcoming token economy that combines content creators, advertisers, and consumers.”BLTV is an ERC20 token that will be offered to publishers, journalists, advertisers, sources and viewers. It forms the backbone of a media ecosystem in which all participants get compensation for their time and effort in helping tell a story, or for consuming the ads that fund them. Building this kind of economy around a media company will drive that company’s growth — or at least that is the thinking.When viewers watch advertisements on BLOCKTV, they can earn BLTV tokens in exchange for their time. The model is similar to the Basic Attention Token (BAT) offered on the Brave Browser.BLOCKTV has also said that BLTV tokens will incentivize sources to come forward with exclusive news tips and interesting content deserving a wider audience. With over 15 years of experience in journalism, Elad suggests that providing sources with digital money in exchange for news tips will help ensure consistently high-quality and original reporting within the cryptocurrency and blockchain spaces.  “In my experience, when someone wants to give you a story to cover, they either want to promote themselves or someone else who they know,” Elad explained. “These are the two main reasons why people want to share information today. We want to change this through a token-based economy.” The BLTV token will begin its life on Bittrex. News sources, which could include journalists, whistleblowers, or other publication staff, can then submit tips to BLOCKTV’s editorial team. These stories will then be verified to ensure that they meet the company’s journalistic standards.“The token system we are building allows sources to submit a story, which we would then run by our professional editorial team to make sure that the information is true and interesting,” said Ron Friedman, BLOCKTV’s editor-in-chief.Upon publication of their story, sources will receive a cut of the revenue generated by that story’s views and engagement. The story’s continued performance will be monitored using smart contracts to record the number of impressions and calculate the appropriate tokenized reward.According to Friedman, BLOCKTV’s token model has also been optimized to align incentives between news providers and broadcasters. As a result, this creates a token model that encourages the mass distribution of quality news, while sharing the proceeds with sources.“For the first time ever, sources will be compensated for sharing the news with a media outlet. We also plan to add a tipping mechanism and bonus program for stories considered to be extremely important,” Friedman said.BLOCKTV CEO Elad also noted that while BLOCKTV is providing a proof-of-concept for this model, he thinks that other major media outlets will eventually adopt something similar. “BLOCKTV is just a proof of concept for this model, but eventually this will expand and be replicated not only for others in the crypto media sphere but for all news organizations,” he said.While both Elad and Friedman are optimistic that a token-based economy will ensure the production of high-quality, original content, the model also raises questions around concerns of journalistic ethics.According to Joshua Benton, director of Harvard University’s Nieman Journalism Lab, mainstream journalistic norms specifically call for not paying sources. Benton noted that while this may be the standard today, some have pushed back against it in a number of ways.“Traditionally, the journalistic norm has been to not pay sources. However, some arguments have been made that go against this. For example, stories that involve multiple sources might include some that have been paid to disclose information. Also, people may not get paid directly for being a source, but could get compensated in other ways, like being offered payment for licensing photographs.”In the case of BLOCKTV providing sources with BLTV tokens, Benton noted that this sounds similar to a typical publication’s freelance model, in which case it makes sense to provide compensation.“There is nothing wrong with being a journalist that pitches a good news story to a media outlet, and hopefully, there is some money exchanged there,” Benton told Cointelegraph. However, it’s different if payment is being exchanged to a source that is not a journalist, he warned.“For example, if a company has news that it wants to announce and it contacts a media organization and receives payment for publication, rather than putting the news on its own website, that would be looked down upon,” Benton explained.According to Elad, BLOCKTV will primarily accept tips and stories from freelance journalists who do not already contribute to a publication and would like to see an important story get out. Moreover, these sources could remain anonymous or choose to reveal their identity, a concept made possible through a BLTV token function called “BLTV newsroom.”“The BLTV token allows the source to decide if they want to remain anonymous or not. This function is called ‘BLTV newsroom’ and will include a reputation score. Every journalist or publication submitting a story to the BLTV newsroom will have a ranking based on the source’s credibility, the history of the publication, and more,” Elad explained.Even with rigid verification of news tips and reputation scores, Benton remains skeptical of a model that uses tokens to reward its sources. This is mainly due to the financial aspect of it all — at the end of the day, it’s still a source taking money for a story.“News organizations and journalists are supposed to be serving their readers. This means that a journalist is asked to figure out the truth as best determined on a given topic. This information is then shared with an audience,” Benton explained, adding, “The more financial considerations injected into that equation, the more the audience has reason to think that maybe they are not getting the full story.”Benton also points out that a model such as this raises the concern that a news outlet may be producing biased news by only taking one source’s view into consideration.“If one source is getting paid to contribute to a story, it raises questions if the news organization pursued others with different perspectives on that story,” he said.Yet Benton does make an important distinction that sets BLOCKTV’s rewards-based model apart from questionable journalistic behaviors.“Most journalistic corruption in the crypto world involves sources bribing journalists to run stories. This model is the opposite of that approach. However, I still think that most journalists would say that they wouldn’t want to have money being exchanged for certain interactions.”  Benton, who reported on Civil’s failed initial coin offering, also noted that there is an uncertainty that comes with paying sources via cryptocurrency. As in the case of Civil, the blockchain-enabled media platform that gathered a number of journalists together last year by offering payment with its own token. The Civil ICO ultimately flamed out and the token became worthless.Based on this example, Benton notes that while a cryptocurrency can be an appealing form of exchange, some people may not be too excited about receiving compensation from a token of uncertain value.Friedman begs to differ:“We want to get important stories broadcasted, and that extra incentive might encourage people to come to BLOCKTV first. A token-based model allows all parts of the ecosystem to have an interest in the process of telling and sharing news, which goes hand-in-hand with core journalist values.”"

Blockchain Firm's DApp for Ads Now Available ...","Nov 8, 2019",Team lead at the Ethereum (ETH) Foundation Péter Szilágyi has confirmed Dec. 4 as the expected date for the network’s forthcoming Istanbul hard fork.,"In two tweets posted on Nov. 7, Szilágyi indicated that Istanbul will commence at block 9069000. He provided Geth mainnet node operators with a link to a new maintenance release designed to begin the hard fork’s initialization. Geth is the name given to one of the two most popular clients used to operate nodes on the Ethereum network — the other being Parity, which will update upon the activation of Istanbul but is now in the review stage.Following the Constantinople upgrade — which was completed in February of this year —  Istanbul represents the latest hard fork in the network’s eventual transition to Ethereum 2.0, dubbed Berlin, intended to be Ethereum’s final upgrade which is set to take place in 2020.Berlin’s most significant feature is rumoured to be the implementation of a new programmatic proof-of-work (PoW) algorithm dubbed “ProgPoW,” which is intended to combat the advantage that ASIC miners have on the network.“ASIC” refers to mining hardware that uses Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) chips, which are tailored to efficiently mine cryptocurrency based on a specific hashing algorithm.By contrast, set-ups that use graphics processing units (GPUs) are less specialized, and have therefore to date struggled to compete for rewards on the network with those that deploy ASICs.Ethereum’s developers decided to split the implementation of Istanbul into two stages, beginning with a version that included a selection of six Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) for testnet integration in October. Earlier this month, community members of Aragon — an open-source software project for creating Ethereum-based decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) — proclaimed themselves against the protocol’s shift to ProgPow.Aragon One CTO Jorge Izquierdo had indicated in late October that Istanbul would result in breaking of roughly 680 smart contracts on the Aragon platform, stating:“The issue we’re going to have hasn’t been deemed important enough for this hard fork not to happen, which from our point of view is unfortunate [but] it’s a hard balance we understand.”"

and 73.12 TWh of electricity a year — an amount on par with the ...","Nov 9, 2019","The world is slowly, but very surely, turning its attention to climate change, and to the human activities that are having the largest impact. The recent U.N. General Assembly on Climate Change broached these topics in detail, looking at how politics, economy and human activity need to change in order to limit the damage being done to the environment. ","While industries such as oil and fashion leave a prominent carbon footprint that is difficult to reduce, that should not deter others, such as the tech industry, from finding solutions that limit their impact. It is pointless for industries to claim that they are veering away from older, flawed paradigms if they continue to make the same mistakes, such as failing to incorporate sustainability and fair access from the very beginning of a project. This is where emerging technologies have the opportunity to change the game. Technology has the potential to address many of the issues plaguing humanity, including climate change and environmental degradation. As technologies continue to evolve, however, sustainability is not always a top priority when it comes to their ongoing development. This must change, and quickly, if the sustainable future we dream of is to be achieved.As with most technologies, blockchain in its current iteration has a number of major weaknesses when it comes to functioning in a sustainable manner. This is perhaps most evident in the mining of cryptocurrencies, and particularly in the case of Bitcoin (BTC) and the vast amounts of energy required to mine it.Studies show that, across the network, mining Bitcoin requires between 52.9 and 73.12 TWh of electricity a year — an amount on par with the annual energy consumption of Austria. This has massive implications for climate change, of course. But for the sake of argument, let’s imagine that all this energy is coming from low or zero-emission sources like hydro or nuclear; and yet, the need for so much power still creates other systemic issues that cannot be ignored. It presents an enormous barrier to entry, for one thing. Small miners are often unable to afford the high costs associated with this amount of energy use, not to mention the exorbitant prices of high-end mining rigs capable of running the Bitcoin network, meaning they are priced out of the activity from the get-go. This has led to the need for economies of scale and the emergence of mining pools. That is, a wave of centralization that is contrary to the ethos that underpins blockchain technology as envisioned by Satoshi Nakamoto.Tech, and especially emerging tech such as blockchain, has the opportunity to take an alternate approach to its own development. The innovators of yore were starting from the ground floor, unable to visualize the potential long-term impact of their inventions. But today’s innovators have the advantage of centuries of hindsight. We have all seen the cost –– in both capital and lost productivity –– required to upgrade outdated, wasteful technological infrastructure. Though there will surely be future advances that we can’t even begin to imagine, incorporating sustainable methods from the beginning will make this process less painful in the long run. When speaking about power in the context of technology, literal power in the form of energy is of course paramount. But there are also more nebulous kinds of power, such as those that arise from accessibility. As discussed in my previous article, blockchain has the potential to give power back to the people. But that can only be the case if it’s accessible to as many people as possible.With this in mind, those developing new blockchain projects need to do some soul searching and decide, from the outset, exactly what sort of project they want theirs to be. If they find that they want it to be truly decentralized, available to everyone regardless of economic background, then they need to choose consensus mechanisms and platform architectures that enable this — as opposed to energy-intensive operations like proof-of-work that favor the already wealthy and promote centralization. Proof-of-stake, the preeminent alternative to proof-of-work, solves the energy problem, but creates a new barrier to entry and new sources of centralization. One still has to buy into the system in order to participate, and — by design — those who have invested more have a higher probability of reaping rewards. The mechanisms driving centralization and inaccessibility in this case may be different, but the outcome is similar.This is why I believe that proof-of-space-time, a protocol which utilizes unused disk space on ordinary desktop PCs to run the network, holds so much promise. It’s permissionless like PoW but uses only a fraction of the energy needed for such. It achieves this by having network participants commit free disk space on their hard-drives and creates a blockmesh as opposed to a blockchain. Ultimately, by developing technologies in a more sustainable and egalitarian manner, movers in the industry can actively take part in shaping a society where the environment is respected and there is no restriction in the power of access to newer technologies or better models. By shaping blockchain technology differently, we have the chance to not only build a tech that does not have such a burdensome effect on the environment, but which also gives everyone the power to access it and impact its future, bringing it back to its democratic roots. The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.Tomer Afek is the CEO and co-founder of Spacemesh, a fair and distributed blockmesh operating system powered by a unique proof-of-space-time consensus protocol.

[...] Other governments now realize this is now actually really happening and that the questions and challenges that are implied in an e-currency are now real. I hope this will lend further momentum to decisions on a global basis.”Stoffel added that blockchain has its issues and that all the money laundering concerns need to be addressed. Lastly, she also expressed the idea that regulators should collaborate with startups to help them understand what can and cannot be done.As Cointelegraph reported at the end of October, the Standing Committee of the 13th National People's Congress in China has passed a law regulating cryptography that will take effect on Jan. 1, 2020, possibly paving the way for its own CBDC."

This, in turn, caused the EOS network to enter congestion mode and limit the number of transactions users can broadcast to their pro-rata share of total staked CPU resources on the blockchain.The activity related to the token is responsible for a remarkable portion of total activity on the network:“Currently, we’re observing around 95% of all EOS transfer actions are related to the EIDOS contract.”Average users, who hold a relatively low amount of staked CPU resources, are currently unable to send transactions. That being said, the exchange also notes that this situation is only temporary. Coinbase expects the network to return to its normal state as soon as it is no longer profitable to collect the tokens or the CPU leases expire after 30 days and the lenders do not renew the lease. Coinbase also points out:“It is important to note that the EOS protocol is behaving as expected, but congestion mode prevents users from having transactions processed that exceed their CPU stake.”As Cointelegraph reported at the end of October, EOS holds the top spot in China’s state-backed crypto rankings, while Bitcoin (BTC) is ranked 11th."

By applying ZKP, Samsung SDS intends to provide a higher level of privacy for users of its enterprise blockchain platform Nexledger, QEDIT said in a press release on Nov. 14.","To apply the technology, Samsung SDS has signed a memorandum of understanding with Israeli privacy-enhancing technology provider QEDIT in Seoul. According to the announcement, the agreement was signed by Jeanie Hong, senior VP at Samsung SDS’ blockchain division, and Jonathan Rouach, CEO and co-founder of QEDIT.Based on ZCP cryptography, QEDIT’s protocol is designed to allow parties employing enterprise blockchains to record and authenticate transactions on a shared ledger without disclosing confidential data.Specifically, QEDIT’s private asset transfer solution makes digital payments between banks private when they are transferred, while regulators and institutions can selectively disclose certain details about transactions. Hong said:“The performance of QEDIT’s private asset transfer solution has been exemplary during the rigorous series of testing and trials we conducted. The QEDIT team has consistently demonstrated the ability to horizontally scale ZKP cryptography in a blockchain environment, and has shown a deep appreciation of the challenges confronting enterprises from a privacy perspective.”Prior to partnering with Samsung SDS, QEDIT has made similar agreements with other major global firms, including Big Four auditing firm Deloitte. Following an agreement announced in late October 2019, the CTO at Deloitte’s EMEA Blockchain Lab noted that QEDIT’s ZCP solution ensures that organizations can trust the authenticity of qualifications while maintaining data privacy and regulatory compliance.As reported by Cointelegraph, ConsenSys’s enterprise blockchain startup Kaleido became the first firm to implement QEDIT’s ZCP solution in mid-September 2019."

The prototype is reported to provide interfaces for other blockchain networks to connect and integrate without friction. In a statement, MAS chief fintech officer, Sopnendu Mohanty, has indicated the broader ambitions of the partners, noting that:“We look forward to linking up with more blockchain networks to improve cross-border connectivity. This will be a big step forward in making cross-border transactions faster, cheaper and safer.”Under the aegis of Ubin, the partners have proceeded beyond technical experimentation to investigate the prototype’s commercial viability, engaging with over 40 financial and nonfinancial firms to explore the network’s numerous potential benefits.Major transnational consultancy firm Accenture has been commissioned to publish a report with the results of the prototype by early 2020, which will also indicate additional features that could be provided by the network in the future.This fall, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said that Facebook’s prospective Libra stablecoin is “a neat idea that will never happen” — hardening his earlier opinion of the project’s prospects. JPMorgan itself is reportedly expecting to pilot its own digital token, JPM Coin, by the end of 2019.In a report published almost a year ago today, MAS published an in-depth report together with the central banks of Canada and the United Kingdom, which argued that central bank digital currencies can help to improve counterparty credit risk for cross-border interbank payments and settlements."

The company claims that over 500,000 acceptance points around the world and ten crypto exchanges support trading of gold and gold products for KBC.In the announcement, BaFin said that Karatbit conducted business in Germany without the necessary license. However, the regulator pointed out that although the order was effective immediately, it may still be subject to judicial review.As The Guardian reported on Nov. 13, the public prosecutor in Stuttgart had also initiated investigations into the company’s activities. In response to the allegations, Karatbars told the Guardian that no investigations into KBC had begun and ensured that “no customer or partner has ever incurred losses due to Karatbars and its products.”Karatbars further argued that those German customers holding KBC received it as “only a free bonus gift that came with other Karatbars products,” and that BaFin’s ruling was based on a fake Karatbars website.To guarantee the stability of its tokens, Karatbars claims that it owns a share in a gold mine located in Madagascar that purportedly contains 900 million euros ($990 million) worth of the precious metal. Moreover, the company’s founder, Harald Seiz, said that the company had secured $100 million through sales of KBC.In contradictory figures, the company specifically asserted in its white paper that “the gold mine in Madagascar having 900 billion euros was bought.” Seiz also reportedly failed to prove his ownership of a stake in the gold mine.Moreover, Karatbars used former football stars Lothar Mattäus, Roberto Carlos and Patrick Kluivert’s images without their permission to promote its products.

to be."" #Blockchain · #Cryptocurrencies · #Law · #FinCEN · #Bitcoin ...","Nov 15, 2019",The United States Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) Director Kenneth Blanco said that Anti-Money Laundering (AML) laws will be strictly enforced in the world of cryptocurrencies.,"On Nov. 15, Reuters reported that Blanco made it crystal clear that cryptocurrency companies engaged in money service businesses will have to comply with AML laws and share information about their customers.Speaking at a conference hosted by Chainalysis, a New York-based blockchain analysis company, Blanco told the audience that the so-called travel rule also applied to digital currencies and that the government expects crypto firms to comply. He said:“It [travel rule] applies to CVCs [convertible virtual currencies] and we expect that you will comply, period. [...] That’s what our expectation is. You will comply. I don’t know what the shock is. This is nothing new.”In what has now become known as the travel rule, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) guidelines require regulators and Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) to collect and share personal data of transactions. The recommendation imposes the same standards on the cryptocurrency sector as are normally shouldered by the banking industry.Blanco further pointed out that FinCEN has been conducting investigations that include compliance with the travel rule since 2014, adding that it is the most commonly cited violation among money service businesses engaged in digital currencies.In October, Blanco spoke at the University of Georgetown where he said that AML laws apply to everyone. Blanco pointed to the key objective of AML policy, which is obtaining information about who is involved in a given payment, saying:""There is a reason you want to know ... the person on the other side of that transaction — they might be dealing in some kind of illicit activity. Whether it’s opioids ... or human smuggling on the other side ... you want to know who that person is.”Blanco told the audience at the time that it is not that hard to obtain that information. “All we’re asking for is name, address, account number, transaction, recipient, and amount,” he said, adding:“So when you tell me you don’t know who’s on the other side, you’ve got a big problem.

According to an expert at blockchain research firm Dragonfly Research, Mimblewimble's privacy is fundamentally flawed, which he reportedly proved by discovering the exact addresses of senders and recipients for 96% transactions of Mimblewimble’s privacy-centric coin Grin (GRIN).","Ivan Bogatyy, a researcher at United States-based Dragonfly Capital Partners, published a Medium post on Nov. 18 in which he claimed that he was able to break Grin’s purported privacy while spending just $60 per week on Amazon Web Services (AWS).According to the researcher, the problem is inherent to Mimblewimble, and there is no way to fix it. Based on new findings, Mimblewimble should no longer be considered as a “viable alternative to Zcash or Monero when it comes to privacy,” Bogatyy declared.The expert added that Mimblewimble developers have been aware of the technical feasibility of such an attack since he posted a Reddit thread on the issue a year ago.In the analysis, Bogatyy referred to anonymity sets, which are patterns that aggregate multiple transactions into a set, such that they can no longer be distinguished. Based on anonymity sets, Bogatyy pointed out three major approaches to privacy in cryptocurrencies such as Zcash, Monero and Mimblewimble.According to the researcher, Zcash purportedly provides the maximum possible anonymity as its anonymity set includes all the shielded transactions. In Monero, users should pick their own anonymity set of size 10-25 for any existing on-chain unspent output from Bitcoin transactions (UTXO). In Mimblewimble, all transactions in a block are aggregated into one big CoinJoin, purportedly ensuring that an anonymity set is all the transactions that ended up in the same block.However, Bogatyy says he has managed to catch 96% transactions before they could be aggregated with others for anonymity. “So in reality, there is no one in their anonymity set,” the expert claimed, adding that he was not able to hack all 100% transactions because there was a small minority of transactions that merged before most nodes could see them.Following Bogatyy’s tweet, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin replied to emphasize that Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge (zk-SNARK) is an example of the only global anonymity sets that are secure. He tweeted:“If your privacy model has a medium anonymity set, it really has a small anonymity set. If your privacy model has a small anonymity set, it has an anonymity set of 1. Only global anonymity sets (eg. as done with ZK-SNARKs) are truly robustly secure.”Zcash is reportedly the first widespread application of zk-SNARKs, according to the firm.Amid the news, Grin token has seen a sharp drop of price. With a market share of 12.7 million, the token is down more than 11% over the past 24 hours at press time and trades at $1.34, according to Coin360.Grin 24-hour price chart. Source: Coin360"

But that news was incorrect. The story was originally was broken on Nov. 7 by two Russian state-owned news agencies, Tass and Iz.ru, which also highlighted that the Russian blockchain platform Universa was assisting the Central Bank of Tunisia, or BCT, in the task. ","By Nov. 11, the BCT denied all claims regarding the development of a central bank digital currency. Specifically, the bank declared that although it is “working on finance digitalisation,” it does not have any kind of relationship with any domestic or foreign firm.Alexander Borodich, the CEO of Universa, who was quoted in both original reports, claimed on Nov. 11 that the media misinterpreted the situation. However, Borodich had posted a link on Nov. 8 to one of the news stories on his Facebook page, and even said in an interview released on Nov. 10, saying that: “So, we were able to launch — Tunisia launched, using our technology, the national digital currency.” Overall, the startup actively participated in the news cycle, distributing the information through interviews and social media up to a day before the BCT's statement.On Nov. 7, Tass and Iz.ru ran news articles with headlines that translate as “Russian developers will ensure the turnover of the electronic currency of Tunisia” and “Digital dinar: Tunisia launches electronic currency,” respectively.The Tass report reads, “Tunisia has become the first country to announce the transfer of part of the country's money supply to electronic form,” while Iz.ru alleges that Borodich said, “Tunisia’s digital money is not cryptocurrency, but a CBDC.” Both of them highlighted that Universa was handling the technical side of the project.The CBDC — dubbed the “uDinar” by Universa Hub Africa, though similar projects have used the term ""eDinar"" — was set to be state-owned and backed by paper money, the reports claimed. Blockchain, in turn, would protect it against counterfeiting and make issuance cheaper and more transparent. The Tass article quoted Borodich as saying:“Electronic banknotes cannot be faked — each such banknote, like the paper version, is protected by cryptography, it, like the paper counterpart, has its own digital watermarks. And the production of such a banknote is 100 times cheaper than spending ink, paper, electricity for the printing press.”Additionally, the news pieces noted that Universa was set to receive a percentage of all transactions carried out with the uDinar, and the ledger would be visible to the country’s central bank. On Nov. 12, Tunisia’s central bank issued its official announcement that refuted all claims regarding the development of the uDinar. The central bank clarified that it is currently exploring various methods of digital payment alternatives, including a possible CBDC, but has yet to proceed with its implementation. The bank further stated:""The BCT is presently working on finance digitalisation, in its digital currency dimension and not the one involving crypto-currency. Its departments are considering the opportunities and risks inherent to these new technologies, notably as regards cyber security and financial stability.""Notably, the BCT pointed to a possible cause of the misleading reports. The bank noted that the Forex Club of Tunisia featured talks regarding CBDCs. On Nov. 7, the club held an event that was hosted by an “an independent association from the BCT” — most likely the event’s tech partner, Universa Hub Africa. Cointelegraph did not receive a response from the Forex Club regarding the event.According to the BTC’s statement, participants at this event attended a “technical feasibility demonstration of a digital currency theoretical solution,” initiated by an unnamed private startup that has “no moral or contractual relationship whatsover with the BCT,” the announcement elaborated, concluding: “This Proof of concept was taken out of context, becoming thereby a marketing operation where the BCT’s name has been unduly used.”The BCT didn't respond to a request for comment for this story to confirm, among other topics, which startup participated in the said proof of concept.Once the news cycle started, when media reports alleging that Tunisia had become the first country to issue a CBDC surfaced, Universa itself began to circulate since-debunked reports, sharing links on its social media channels, including Twitter and Telegram. Further, on Nov. 7, Cointelegraph received an email sent from a private Gmail address and signed by Mikhail Dremidov. Titled “URGENT: Tunisia issues state e-currency CBDC on Universa,” the letter contained a link to the above mentioned Iz.ru news piece. As per LinkedIn, someone with the same name, Mikhail Dremidov, is listed as a PR manager at Universa. When Cointelegraph asked what company Dremidov was speaking for and why he would promote a news story that was later refuted by an official source, the email sender replied that “I represent myself.” He also referred to the press release written by Universa CEO Borodich that described the recent events in detail.Borodich argued in the press release that on Nov. 7, Universa Hub Africa launched uDinar, backed by the Tunisian dinar, as a proof of concept and that “no question of CBDC émission related to uDinar was discussed at the Forex Club Tunisie Congress.” He also confirmed that the BCT “has no contractual aspect on CBDC with Universa Hub Africa.” Finally, he claimed that “the misinterpretation in the articles that followed was not based on claims of Universa’s or BCT official representatives.”When pressed about why he would refer Cointelegraph to a story that was proven false, Dremidov — who also admitted that he provides “part-time consulting services in PR” and referred to Borodich as “our CEO” as the discussion continued — said that he “was not in Tunisia and thought that the information in TASS was true.” The articles were written wholly by Russian journalists who were present at the Forex Club Tunisie Congress, he added, while Universa’s official position could only be represented by their CEO — i.e., Borodich, who was speaking at the event. When asked to confirm the authenticity of Borodich’s quotes featured in both the Tass and Iz.ru stories, Dremidov replied:“I can’t confirm the quotes because I was not in Tunisia and don’t understand French for my pity. I provide a part-time consulting services in PR, but I can confirm that the titles of articles (TASS and IZ.ru) are incorrect and that's what made readers confused.”Notably, while the conference was held mostly in French, Borodich delivered his presentation in English, as seen in the video recorded at the Forex Club Tunisie Congress.Dremidov also said that Universa was trying to reach out to Tass and Iz.ru to update the pieces. “That’s hard because they are huge media giants,” he explained. Cointelegraph has also contacted Tass and Iz.ru to confirm the authenticity of their reports but has not received any responses. Borodich provided similar answers upon a request from Cointelegraph. When asked how exactly he was contacted by Tass and Iz.ru's reporters, and whether they explained to him that they were going to break news on Tunisia launching a CBDC based on Universa’s blockchain, the CEO replied:“There was a press-conference, just after uDinar demo on stage. All articles have been written by reporters on their own and based on their editorial policy. They did not explain anything to me.”He added: “We asked TASS and Iz.ru to update their articles via e-mail. As you know, TASS is the major state-owned media agency with lots of departments. It took time.”Borodich evaded answering why Universa posted links to the original reports on its social media channels, contacted Cointelegraph via email implying that it was newsworthy material, posted one of those links on his private Facebook feed, and told an interviewer that “Tunisia launched, using our technology, the national digital currency."" He did answer the following question, however: If you knew that IZ.ru and Tass had exaggerated the scope of Universa's partnership with Tunisian officials, why would you continue to channel those statements? To that, the Universa CEO stated: “It took time to clarify our points of view about definitions ‘u-dinar, e-dinar’ etc because of the weekend. It took time to translate everything either. The Congress was in french language. We have 10 years partnership with Tunisia and the last thing we wanted is something which my harm our previous achievements with digitalisation there. We do respect all our partners and behave accordingly.”Further, according to a press release issued by the Forex Club Tunisie Congress, the event featured “a simple theoretical demonstration of a digital currency developed by a Tunisian fintech labelled Start-up Act.” It continued: “Therefore, what has been reported by some press regarding the issuance by the Central Bank of Tunisia of a digital currency at this congress is unfounded.”The press release then went on to outline that there was indeed a debate held regarding the possible issuance of CBDCs, where an expert from the International Monetary Fund outlined the possible risks of issuing such an asset.Interestingly, the statement mentioned neither Universa Hub Africa nor the uDinar project, although they were indeed part of the conference, as seen on the video broadcast. The aforementioned IMF expert is Herve Tourpe clarified that the BCT has not yet launched a digital currency and later called the reports of a CBDC “fake news.”An IMF representative speaking on behalf of Tourpe told Cointelegraph that he had no comment. The Tunisian Forex Club has not responded to Cointelegraph’s requests for comment, while Start-up Act told Cointelegraph that it is “not involved in this topic with BCT.” Universa’s token, UTNP, experienced a pump that lasted throughout the first news cycle and traded at almost $0.007 during its peak, according to data from Coin360. Once the BCT refuted the story, however, Universa’s price shed more than 50%. According to Dremidov, however, “there was no dump” but “two sales of $12k approximately.”In Universa’s official Telegram group, some investors felt misinformed. “It wasn’t only the media that reported the news wrong, it was also Universa’s team that reported the news wrong,” a user nicknamed Uly55 wrote at the time. “It was posted here and on twitter that it’s a CBDC. But nothing, no explanation, no apology.” Another user nicknamed @BitJox argued: “The worst thing in this story is the reactions of the admins yesterday when people were congratulating them of the ‘Launch of the CBDC.’ Admins were not denying anything.”Upon being contacted by Cointelegraph, Uly55 explained that he no longer felt like he was misled. “That post was done in the heat of the moment, before everything was cleared up,” the user said of his initial concern. “From my understanding it was the news who grabbed the wrong news and then it spread fast, too fast for Universa to handle it.”BitJox, on the other hand, told Cointelegraph that this story made him stop buying more Universa tokens. When asked whether he felt like Universa mislead him, he replied: “They obviously did.” He then clarified that he didn’t know if it was intentional, although he’s inclined to say that it was:“On the [Universa] telegram group, all users who haven't been banned by the admins are talking about ‘deep state practices’ from the IMF.”BiJox believes that this could be true, but thinks the head of Universa HUB Africa, Omar Bouattay, was speaking at the conference about Universa issuing the uDinar, not the government, which he believes would make it an ordinary coin and not a CBDC. He went on to add: “So yeah, I think they totally lied by playing with words. They made us think CBDC is backed and managed by a central bank. But it's actually issued by a private company.”“The worst thing in this story,” according to Bitjox, is that while a private company unveiled its plans to issue the uDinar, there is no information about which company is going to audit that process:“We don't know if U-Dinar is really backed by actual paper money or by thin air.”The first reports on Tunisia experimenting with digital currencies date back to 2015, when Swiss software startup Monetas (whose CEO has since gained notoriety due to the Tezos scandal) announced the pilot launch of eDinar, a digital currency developed in partnership with Tunisia’s post office (La Poste Tunisienne) and local startup DigitUs. There have been no updates on the project since, and its website is currently offline.Further, in April, media reports suggesting that Tunisia’s central bank was looking to issue a Bitcoin bond surfaced. Marouane el-Abassi, the governor of the country’s central bank, had reportedly announced in April this year that Tunisia had created a working group for this purpose. He also added that Tunisia had launched the eDinar and had already been processing transactions through a native Poste Tunisienne system developed by DigitUs.Meanwhile, the latest announcement from the BCT suggests that the central bank is open to ideas involving blockchain but prefers to go slow with the technology’s implementation and even more so with a digital currency."

Pay-to-Play Gaming Is Flawed, Blockchain-Based Platform ...","Nov 22, 2019","Harvard University’s Kennedy School carried out a live simulation of a White House National Security Council meeting on Nov. 19, featuring former senior administration officials and thought leaders. The “Digital Currency Wars” event examined a potential future scenario, following a North Korean missile test, potentially enabled by China’s proposed digital yuan.","The simulation was set two years in the future, with China’s digital yuan having theoretically been launched 20 months previously. The digital yuan has risen to not only dominate the Chinese domestic payments space, but its ease of use and the Belt and Road Initiative is seeing adoption spread across South East Asia.The game includes a newsflash of a North Korean missile test, more advanced than Washington had believed, and thought to have been funded through U.S. sanction avoidance via the use of the digital yuan.With sanctions failing, the Security Council meeting discussed options to put to the president.One of the key points put forward was that the U.S. would at this point be reliant on the Chinese. The simulated Treasury Secretary pointed out:“We will not successfully starve North Korea economically without the cooperation of China, and certainly not if it is their objective to see us fail.”He also pointed out the 30 years of history in which the U.S. had not been successful in persuading China to use its leverage.The meeting was interrupted mid-way through with another newsflash, this time revealing that the SWIFT system had been cyber-attacked and $3 billion stolen from commercial banks in Germany, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates.The eventual recommendations which the group decided to put forward to the president hinged on measures attempting to prevent a bifurcation of the global economy.The weaponization of SWIFT was proving less effective, although some at the meeting still seemed intent on hardening the system and relying on existing strategies. The more forward-thinking attendees felt that more should be done to ensure the U.S. had a similar digital currency capacity, to resuscitate its financial power.This included the option of putting diplomatic pressure on China to cooperate, use electronic intelligence to highlight North Korea’s sanction breaking, or develop its own digital dollar competitor. The threat of military pressure was also considered as a less desirable option.As American policymakers increasingly engage with the blockchain and cryptocurrency space, several lawmakers have called for rapid regulation and legal certainty for the nascent technology and digital assets, so as not to fall too far behind more lenient jurisdictions.As Cointelegraph recently reported, the number of Chinese blockchain patents now numbers in the upper 7,000s, outstripping the U.S. over three times.A Chinese blockchain investor recently stated that a digital yuan is in the advanced stages of development, and is likely to launch with the next six to 12 months."

The trial aimed to give participants access to cheaper, renewable energy and let solar infrastructure owners monetize their surplus energy. “BRPL was able to access a cost-effective energy alternative during the times of peak demand pricing leading to increased efficiency and reliability of the power supply,” Power Ledger stated. BRPL CEO Amal Sinha commented on the trial results:“With the exponential growth in our economy and production, the ability to generate clean energy and utilize it across India without the need for a fully centralized grid is critical. Realizing the importance of distributed generation, we have already built an extensive renewables infrastructure, and this trial with Power Ledger will help us fully utilize that energy.”Solar power is a fast-growing source of energy in India, as the country has the lowest capital cost per MW to install solar power plants globally. As of September, the country’s solar capacity exceeded 31 gigawatts. In recent months, Power Ledger has conducted other blockchain-based energy trading trials in different countries. Earlier in November, the company partnered with a local energy retailer to roll out its technology in South Australia, allowing Australians to pool their excess solar and battery storage to a Virtual Power Plant for greater control and management of their energy.In early October, Power Ledger revealed its plans to run another blockchain-enabled energy trading trial in Japan’s Kanto region by December 2019. The trial will track surplus solar energy levels and electricity trading, integrating a blockchain-enabled P2P platform with household smart meter systems in the Kanto region.Recent research from Navigant Research, a Colorado-based market research and consulting firm, showed that energy blockchain applications are expected to see a 67% compound annual growth rate over the next 10 years."

like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) rather than regulated security tokens.","Nov 15, 2019","On Nov. 7, Ashley Alder, the CEO of the Securities and Futures Commission of Hong Kong, said at a conference that a new framework for crypto exchanges will be implemented. Almost immediately after the announcement, Reuters reported that a crypto exchange based in Hong Kong called OSL became the first to apply for a license with the SFC.","While the introduction of a license for crypto exchanges by the government of Hong Kong is widely viewed as positive reinforcement for the growth of the crypto sector in Asia, some view it as a redundant solution that fails to facilitate the needs of local exchanges.In a conversation with Cointelegraph, George Harrap, the co-founder and CEO of Bitspark, a company based in Hong Kong that allows crypto-to-cash trades, said that the framework is not applicable to the majority of exchanges that operate within the region.Simply put, because the framework restricts the scope of the license to companies that facilitate security token trades and serve institutional investors, it does not provide additional regulatory clarity to local companies. Harrap noted that this will not apply to any existing Hong Kong-based exchanges:“The restrictions are many: security tokens only (of which literally none of traded on exchanges, even after 3 years of talking about it), institutional clients only (of which HK doenst really have any, its all retail and HNW) and requirement of insurance which doesn't really exist for this business. It's also part of the sandbox so there are restrictions on how many clients you can onboard anyway, not good for growth.”Most exchanges based in Hong Kong that provide support to local users and investors in mainland China through over-the-counter trading are focused on offering liquidity for major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) rather than regulated security tokens.As such, the framework released by the SFC, in its current form, is not necessarily relevant to major exchanges that operate in Hong Kong. “So as I can see, this is not useful and nobody except perhaps lawyers and consultants were asking for this,” Harrap added.Although the SFC’s criteria for crypto exchanges has seen mixed reactions from the local community, several exchange executives consider it to be an overall positive factor for growth over the long term.Jason Lau, the chief operating officer at OKCoin and head of business development at OKGroup, said that having an option to be regulated — regardless of the scope of the regulation — is a big step for the industry.Dovey Wan, a founding partner at Primitive Crypto, said that the framework could positively affect local exchanges serving mainland Chinese investors like Huobi, adding that it is “big” for the sector.Despite being an important crypto exchange market in the aftermath of the imposition of a ban by the People’s Bank of China on trading of cryptocurrencies, Hong Kong has lacked clear guidelines for exchanges for years. It can be argued that based on the structure of the license criteria, guidelines in Hong Kong still remain ambiguous for local companies.However, firms anticipate that it could become a stepping stone toward the introduction of a more practical and comprehensive regulatory framework for trading platforms in the future.In Hong Kong, many mainland investors are said to be trading cryptocurrencies in Hong Kong through Tether (USDT), a stablecoin whose value is pegged one-to-one with the U.S. dollar. Often, traders purchase Tether to invest in major cryptocurrencies and convert Tether to the Hong Kong dollar to sell their cryptocurrency holdings for fiat, as reported by SCMP.Previously, Terence Tsang, the CEO of Hong Kong- and Taiwan-based cryptocurrency exchange TideBit, said that the scrutiny from the Chinese government was targeted at local exchanges in China claiming to be based outside of the country, not at companies that are already based outside of the nation.Since exchanges in Hong Kong that have been facilitating trades for mainland investors have operated without significant roadblocks throughout the past two years, and given that the scope of the SFC’s framework is not inclusive of major cryptocurrencies, Harrap told Cointelegraph that the license criteria is unlikely to have any impact, adding that:“A license also does not improve the banking situation in HK, even if licensed, banks won't open accounts for business areas they don't want to service of which crypto is one.”Regardless of the direction the SFC may be heading with its newly released criteria for exchanges, Hong Kong is moving toward tightening its oversight over the local cryptocurrency market.In December 2018, the SFC directly contacted cryptocurrency exchanges rumored to have had troubles with processing deposits and withdrawals for users, and requested several initial coin offerings to shut down.The SFC’s warning against cryptocurrencies late last year was primarily targeted at ICOs, but it emphasized that it will look over exchanges operating in the local market. Even at the time, Timothy Loh, a Hong Kong-based lawyer, said that the requirements set forth by the SFC could be burdensome for local companies.Hence, even though the general sentiment around the approach of the SFC remains positive among local executives and companies, it is possible that the additional requirements could create a tougher environment for companies to operate in. This could be especially true for Japan, South Korea and other Asian markets creating clear regulatory frameworks to support local companies.In recent months, major markets with top fiat-to-crypto trading pairs — such as the United States dollar, Japanese yen, South Korean won and British pound — have started to increase compliance with the guidelines created by the G-7’s Financial Action Task Force.As the global cryptocurrency exchange market adapts clearer policies for trading platforms that are described by the FATF as “Virtual Asset Service Providers,” Hong Kong and others that have struggled to clearly define rules for exchanges in the past are expected to embrace more efficient policies."

The new metric will reportedly incorporate data from 3000 crypto assets.Intending to filter out market manipulation, CoinMarketCap will reportedly base the new liquidity metric on adaptive data. Carylyne Chan, chief strategy officer at CoinMarketCap, elaborated on the firm’s aims with their methodology:“We believe our adaptive methodology will make our metric very difficult to ‘game’ as orders would need to be placed close to the mid-price, or risk being counter-productive to the Liquidity metric scoring.”Elaborating on what this adaptive methodology consists of, Chan told Cointelegraph:“With the new Liquidity metric, orders that are closer to mid-price or current market prices are given heavier weightage. Those orders further are discounted. The extent of the discount adapts according to the absolute liquidity of the market-pair, by studying the order book depth and distance from mid-price.”The firm said that it sees its new metric as a way of escaping dependence on volume reporting, which is often subject to wash trading and other means of manipulation on different exchanges. At The Capital, Chan said that “volume has lost its value as a metric.” She further explained CoinMarketCap’s desire to shift focus away from volume:“Today, we are introducing a new metric to highlight what matters most to investors and traders: liquidity. With our Liquidity metric, we hope to provide public good to the crypto markets by encouraging the provision of liquidity instead of the inflation of volumes.”Chan explained to Cointelegraph that CoinMarketCap is still working to expand the number of exchanges provided the company with data on liquidity:“While volume is a single number reported by exchanges, Liquidity requires us to apply our adaptive algorithm to the order book data received, which requires some time. At the moment, we have received order books from 70% of the listed exchanges. We highly encourage any exchange who hasn't submitted their order book data yet to do so, as our Liquidity metric will become the default ranking soon.”As Cointelegraph reported at the time, CoinMarketCap initially teased their planned liquidity metric at the end of August, in which they cited Nov. 12 as their target date.In July, CoinMarketCap, alongside crypto news outlet Crypto Briefing, launched a new institutional-grade analysis product called Simetri. The product aims to provide verification and transparency in order-book data from crypto exchanges."

During his tenure, China soared to become one of the world’s leading economies.Zhou made his comments during a speech delivered in Beijing as part of the 10th Caixin Summit on Nov. 8, according to a tweet from Dovey Wan, founding partner of blockchain investment firm Primitive Ventures.A rough translation of Zhou Xiaochuan’s remarks reveals that his take on Libra is guided by concerns surrounding the implications of the asset being governed by a consortium of private-sector firms.The former governor stressed that the general public will inevitably question the motivations of the Libra Association and argued that more trust would be afforded to the initiative if it was in the hands of an international organization such as the IMF. The Libra Association will undoubtedly make a profit from the project, he noted, and could then use the money for other things — such as potentially channeling it into the provision of other financial services.Notwithstanding these arguments, he suggested that broadly speaking, an initiative such as Libra was a positive development.As reported, the People’s Bank of China — an institution is expected to become the first in the world to launch a central bank digital currency (CBDC). The project — which has been framed by some as having been accelerated by the direct competition posed by Libra — has generated considerable interest in the cryptocurrency industry. PBoC Deputy Director Mu Changchun revealed this August that the CBDC will be structured as a centralized, two-tier system, with the PBoC at the top tier and the second tier managed by domestic commercial banks.Recently, Ethereum (ETH)’s co-founder and ConsenSys CEO Joe Lubin expressed his belief that the People’s Bank of China is unlikely to implement the decentralized design of blockchain for its forthcoming CBDC. Lubin argued that the asset is likely to be used to maintain Chinese authorities’ existing oversight of capital flows and that, if anything, the PBoC will make use of “some of the cryptographic primitives of blockchain.”"

He referred to code-cracking efforts by the United States during World War II: “In the history of World War II, if you crack people’s code, you don’t tell them. This is what happened between the United States and Germany. The United States knew a bunch of codes and secret communications from Germany, but they didn’t reveal it, because if they revealed it, Germany would change everything.” When Google announced “quantum supremacy” last month, people in the crypto industry mostly questioned how far it was from becoming useful. It would certainly be a huge problem if “real” quantum computers can actually reverse engineer secret private keys from known public keys, as some fear. But according to some experts in the industry, that day is far from now — the conclusion seems to be that we don’t have to worry about it.Elixxir is the blockchain that supports Praxxis, the quantum resistant and private digital currency. As Cointelegraph previously reported, Dolbear announced the new xx network that will serve as a meaningful integration between Elixxir and Praxxis.Commenting on Google’s quantum computer specifically, Dolbear said, “If they have quantum computing, then China does and the United States does.” China is spending $10 billion to build a National Laboratory for Quantum Information Sciences in Hefei, which is expected to open in 2020. Meanwhile, the US funding in quantum efforts is about $200 million per year, according to a July 2016 government report. A useful coin “has to be quantum-secure, that’s it,” Dolbear concluded."

Blockchain Firm's DApp for Ads Now Available ...","Nov 11, 2019","Volvo Cars announced last week that it is using Oracle’s blockchain platform to trace cobalt, one of the main components in electric car batteries. Following the unveiling of the company’s first fully electric car, the XC40 Recharge, Volvo has come up with a new business strategy that includes introducing an electric vehicle every year through 2025.","“Cobalt is at the heart of electric vehicle batteries, yet supplies are limited. Companies like Volvo are ramping up their production significantly, as half of Volvo cars will be electric by 2025. Each car requires 10-20 kilograms of cobalt in their batteries,” Mark Rakhmilevich, senior director of blockchain product management at Oracle, told Cointelegraph.While cobalt is a key mineral for making lithium-ion batteries, the majority of cobalt production comes from the Democratic Republic of Congo, a region criticized for its unethical cobalt mining conditions.According to findings from Amnesty International, children as young as seven are working in life-threatening conditions in the DRC to mine cobalt that ends up in smartphones, tablets and cars each year. Young children and adults are often paid only $1 a day to work under these perilous conditions.Volvo will be applying blockchain technology to provide global traceability in all raw products used throughout its supply chain. Rakhmilevich explained:“Volvo is ensuring that their supplies of cobalt are clear and safe from unethical issues by tracing raw materials on the Oracle blockchain. We’ve been working with Volvo since this summer to implement a material tracking application that captures data relevant to different points in the manufacturing process.”Volvo has also partnered with traceability-as-a-service provider Circulor to trace raw materials through the supply chain to its battery manufacturer and then to Volvo cars. This end-to-end solution would ensure transparent and reliable data sharing, significantly boosting transparency of the entire raw material supply chain.Following a successful pilot with Oracle and Circulor this summer, Volvo Cars has now reached an agreement with its two global battery suppliers, CATL of China and LG Chem of South Korea, to implement cobalt traceability starting this year.Both Oracle and Circulor will operate the blockchain technology across CATL’s supply chain, while the Responsible Sourcing Blockchain Network, together with responsible sourcing specialists RCS Global and IBM, will roll out the technology in LG Chem’s supply chain.Data captured on the Oracle blockchain platform will include the cobalt’s origin, attributes such as weight and size, the chain of custody and information establishing that participant behavior is consistent with globally recognized supply chain guidelines.“We’ve been working with Volvo and Circulor, to implement a material tracking application on top of the Oracle blockchain,” Rakhmilevich said. “This will capture data relevant to different points across the manufacturing process, such as time, location, weight, size and more, to ensure that all materials being used are accurate.”Blockchain is an ideal solution for tracking materials across a supply chain, as the technology creates records of transactions that can’t be changed while also enforcing a common set of rules about which data can be recorded. This lets participants across a network independently verify and audit transactions.“After ensuring that all materials are accurate, we record each data point from those transactions on the blockchain, making that data immutable and transparent across the network,” Rakhmilevich noted.According to Rakhmilevich, Volvo, CATL and seven other companies (participants in this supply chain) currently record about 28 million material scans and other production events monthly on the Oracle blockchain platform. While he is confident that this will scale over time (and eventually evolve into other aspects of the supply chain, like tracing lithium and nickel), the real challenge is properly managing materials.“There are a number of complex stages that cobalt and other materials go through to ensure that data points are captured at origin. This data must then be scanned and secured, so it’s important to make sure that data from physical sources is captured appropriately,” Rakhmilevich explained.According to Caspar Rawles, senior analyst at Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, it’s great that Volvo is using blockchain to track its cobalt, but much of the DRC’s cobalt comes from small, independent mines. Child labor and a number of fatal accidents have been reported in such small-scale, so-called ""artisinal"" mines.Although Volvo is tracking its materials, the company also needs to carefully follow cobalt through the entire supply chain, from where it is mined all the way to where it is shipped in China. This ensures that materials are not then blended with other minerals coming from the DRC.“Volvo needs to trace cobalt not only from the mine but also to where it is being shipped, up until batteries are placed in cars, to ensure that materials are not being blended with unethically sourced items,” Rawles told Cointelegraph.While there are obstacles, Rawles also noted that Volvo has taken the first steps to demonstrate that using technology can ensure sustainability and ethically sourced products:“As more carmakers produce electric vehicles, they need to realize that dealing with the supply chain will be a crucial aspect. It’s good to see that Volvo is taking this approach now with blockchain technology.”"
