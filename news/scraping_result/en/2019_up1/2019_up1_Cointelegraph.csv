Source: Coin360Yesterday, on June 21, professional trader Peter Brandt tweeted that bitcoin’s price is currently taking aim at $100,000 target.In his tweet, Brandt noted that bitcoin is on its fourth parabolic growth phase and is a market like no other:“Bitcoin takes aim at $100,000 target. $btcusd is experiencing its fourth parabolic phase dating back to 2010. No other market in my 45 years of trading has gone parabolic on a log chart in this manner. Bitcoin is a market like no other.”Attached to the tweet, Brandt also published a table containing data about the price growth of bitcoin. According to the data contained in the image, from October 2011 to December 2017, bitcoin increased its value 9,765-fold.Among the responses to the post there are numerous scam attempts, publicizing fake BTC and ETH giveaways from Brandt. At least one of the scams is promoted through verified Twitter profiles.In late May, the co-founder of blockchain investment firm Kenetic predicted that the price of bitcoin will rally as high as $30,000 by the end of this year.Earlier this month, the founder and CEO of Digital Currency Group argued that it “looks like, perhaps, we are coming out of a crypto winter and we’ve entered a crypto spring,” in an interview with Bloomberg.However, in an interview with Cointelegraph the same week, another industry commentator — ex-Wall Street executive and current blockchain researcher Tone Vays expressed skepticism about the fact that crypto winter is over.Earlier this week, cybersecurity firm Kaspersky Lab released the results of a survey showing that 19% of people globally have purchased cryptocurrency."

rally this time around are much different than they were in late 2017.","Jun 23, 2019","As bitcoin’s price keeps setting new yearly highs, the question on everyone’s mind right now is whether it’s different this time. Let’s take a closer look at why this rally is nothing like the “bubble” in 2017.","Bitcoin all-time performance. Source: coin360.comAs many experts pointed out, BTC going above the key psychological $10,000 mark is likely to trigger FOMO (i.e., fear of missing out), according to Fundstrat’s Tom Lee, who adds that bitcoin can now easily take out its all-time highs.Other market analysts, such as Tone Vays, however, disagree. He told Cointelegraph:“I actually don’t think it’s important at all. The $10,000 benchmark did nothing to slow down price back in 2017. And it looks like it did nothing to slow down the prices here in 2019.”Bitcoin broke through into the mainstream in late 2017. At the time, its historic surge to nearly $20,000 was driven mainly by retail investors. This time, however, the public is still largely on the sidelines, according to Google Trends.In fact, the number of Google searches for “bitcoin” is only around 10% of what they were in 2017. In other words, retail investor FOMO has not even started yet, which may suggest that BTC price could go much higher than last time.On the other hand, institutional demand for bitcoin has soared. As of June 17, open interest at CME Group saw 5,311 contracts totalling 26,555 BTC, or approximately $246 million — dwarfing the volumes during the 2017 price peak.“CME Bitcoin futures (BTC) shows growing signs of institutional interest,” CME Group tweeted June 18.“BTC open interest rose by a record 643 contracts in a single day, establishing a new all-time high of 5,311 contracts on June 17 (26,555 equivalent bitcoin; ~$250M notional).”Other indicators, such as the GBTC price premium as well as record volume for bitcoin derivatives exchange BitMEX (on a Saturday!), also suggests that “smart money” is pouring in.As Cointelegraph reported on Friday, hash rate hit a new all-time high at over 65,000,000 TH/s. In other words, Bitcoin is more secure than ever and would require an unfathomable amount of computing power to affect the network.Bitcoin network Hash Rate. Source: blockchain.comMeanwhile, other fundamentals have also grown in lockstep with hash rate. Daily on-chain transaction volume, block size and other metrics are also confirming that more people than ever are using bitcoin.Additionally, network transaction fees have remained relatively low compared to 2017, with optimizations like SegWit and off-chain scaling solutions like the Lightning network helping ease congestion.The latest rally to five figures is also happening way before the Bitcoin block reward halving set for May 2020. This is when mining block rewards will be cut from 12.5 to 6.25 BTC, thus reducing the bitcoins minted by miners who are naturally market sellers.Interestingly, the previous halving event occurred in the summer of 2016 — or more than a year before the price skyrocketed.This time, however, BTC/USD appears to be front-running the event, as the halving is still 333 days away.A popular bitcoin market analyst known as PlanB suggests that investors may not be waiting this time around for the expected reduction in supply. He added:“Front running would be in line with Efficient Market Hypothesis: if you believe S2F and that BTC will be $50k May 2020, why wait?”Of course, intraday BTC price moves are not as important for low time preference investors. These “hodlers” are confident that bitcoin — with its fixed supply — will outperform fiat currencies, whose supply is growing at an accelerating pace over the long term.On June 18, European Central Bank head Mario Draghi hinted that a monetary stimulus is on the way if the economy doesn’t improve. This is an increasingly dovish tone that was applauded by the financial sector.At the same time, Draghi was criticized by United States President Donald Trump, who said this would spark unfair European competition against the U.S., whose Federal Reserve bank is also suggesting it will hold off on raising interest rates.Morgan Creek co-founder Anthony Pompliano tweeted that this will make bitcoin even more scarce as interest rates go lower and more fiat currency is created:“Cut rates.Print money.Make BTC more scarce.Long Bitcoin, Short the Bankers!”Therefore, the biggest macroeconomic picture looks bright for bitcoin investors who are dumping ever-depreciating fiat currencies for hard-capped “digital gold.”What’s more, investors are starting to not only realize that bitcoin’s supply is fixed and transparent, but it’s also the world’s first neutral, open-access money that no authority can control.In other words, what the internet did to information, bitcoin is starting to do to money.Historic BTC market cycles, rising institutional interest alongside an increasingly robust network fundamentals, as well as the confirmed depreciating value of fiat currencies, could all propel bitcoin’s price orders of magnitude higher than in 2017.Crypto markets one-week performance.

3,https://cointelegraph.com,"Jun 12, 2019",Is Bitcoin's Increasing Anonymity a Threat to Privacy Coins?,https://cointelegraph.com/news/is-bitcoins-increasing-anonymity-a-threat-to-privacy-coins,"Bitcoin's privacy is getting better, but does it pose an existential threat 
to anonymous cryptocurrencies? 8451 Total views. 126 Total shares.","Jun 12, 2019","It's no secret that Bitcoin isn't actually anonymous, despite what various outside observers of crypto might claim. It is, in fact, pseudonymous, as its transactions are vulnerable to being traced to specific individuals by governments and intelligence agencies with enough determination and knowhow. However, in recent months, the privacy it offers users has been steadily increasing, given that a number of coin-mixing services and add-ons are successfully providing more and more users with the anonymity that Bitcoin itself doesn't quite furnish on its own.","But with Bitcoin's improving privacy, the possibility emerges that it could end up weakening the position of dedicated privacy coins, such as Monero, Zcash and Dash. If Bitcoin offers anonymity and also a superior store of value, it could potentially cause the popularity of such altcoins to wane to the point where they see less usage, less community support and less growth. In other words, it's possible that Bitcoin is becoming an existential threat to such privacy-enhancing coins.However, not only would this be a worst-case scenario, but developers on both the Bitcoin and altcoin sides of the equation believe that it's highly unlikely. On the one hand, numerous privacy coins offer technological advantages over Bitcoin, even when Bitcoin is benefiting from mixing services. But on the other, the cryptocurrency market is not a zero-sum game, and there is enough space for more than one coin to maintain popularity and a wide user base, especially because Bitcoin — even with enhancements — still isn’t as private as certain rivals.As anyone who followed the Silk Road/Ross Ulbricht saga knows, Bitcoin transactions and wallet addresses can be pinned to particular people, given enough detective work. In 2014, for instance, researchers at Pennsylvania State University managed to map the IP addresses of over 1,000 Bitcoin wallets, doing so by analyzing the Bitcoin network's data flow and looking for isolated transactions from single IP addresses. It has also been suggested via leaks that the National Security Agency (NSA) can identify Bitcoin users by processing internet traffic in bulk.But while this suggests that Bitcoin's privacy isn't perfect, a range of services and plug-ins have been made available over the year that ramp up its protection of user identities. And one of these — CoinJoin — recently celebrated its first-ever 100-person transaction, which was facilitated by the privacy-focused Wasabi Wallet. For those who aren't familiar with such mixing protocols, they basically combine numerous Bitcoin payments into a single transaction, so that it becomes difficult to disentangle who exactly sent what and to whom.According to the Wasabi Wallet, mixed transactions constituted 4.09% of all Bitcoin transactions as of April, with the total having increased by over 300% in only nine months. It would therefore seem that mixers are becoming more popular and are getting better at mixing larger numbers of transactions together. Combined, this could create a virtuous circle, with improved services attracting more users, and more users leading to improved privacy.Mixing services such as CoinJoin aren't the only emergent tech that Bitcoin is likely to use to increase the privacy it offers the public. For one, there's also Dandelion, which according to its GitHub page is ""a transaction routing mechanism that provides formal anonymity guarantees."" It does this by preventing deanonymization, which occurs when a bad actor uses the delay in the transmission of transactions to the Bitcoin network to link these transactions to IP addresses. Put simply, it removes the risk of this by routing transactions over randomly selected paths, so that they can't be linked to specific IP addresses when being transmitted to the network. And according to its authors (who include researchers from Carnegie Mellon and the University of Illinois), by doing this it ""provides near-optimal anonymity guarantees among schemes that do not introduce additional encryption mechanisms.""Alternatively, there's also MimbleWimble, a protocol that uses a combination of zero-knowledge proofs and mixing to enable ""transactions that are completely opaque but can still be properly validated."" It has already been implemented by the new altcoin grin, and it's likely that some implementation of it could become an optional extra for Bitcoin in the future. And even if it isn't, one new privacy-enhancing technology that almost certainly will be added to Bitcoin in the near future is Schnorr signatures. Primarily, these improve Bitcoin's scalability by aggregating multiple transaction signatures into one, but they also have positive privacy implications, since they make it easier and cheaper to use mixing services such as CoinJoin.Taken as a whole, the addition of these new technologies will make Bitcoin considerably more private, and because it already has a head start over dedicated privacy coins in terms of users and its value, this could result in the likes of Monero, Zcash and others being pushed to the sidelines. It's worth pointing out, for example, that since the beginning of the year, Bitcoin has risen by roughly 108% in value, from approximately $3,733 to around $8,000. By contrast, Monero — the most valuable privacy coin by market cap — has risen by roughly 86% over this same period, from $45.90 to roughly $90. Bitcoin is therefore still continuing to attract more investment and more interest, and it's likely that this could work in its favor as it adds more privacy-enhancing features in the future.Bitcoin developers agree with this view, suggesting that the cryptocurrency's much wider pool of users could make it more private than its privacy-focused rivals, at least in practice, as Bitcoin Core developer Ryan Havar told Cointelegraph:""A lot of the privacy coins offer better 'technological' advantages, yet from a practical point of view can be a lot less private. Simply put, there's a lot more bitcoin users, and use cases. So if you can 'hide' in the crowd of bitcoin users, it's a much bigger crowd than say ZCash.""In addition to Bitcoin's improving privacy, a crackdown has been launched against privacy coins in various corners of the globe. For instance, in March, the French National Assembly's finance committee proposed a ban on anonymous cryptocurrencies such as Monero and Zcash, with the committee's head, Eric Woerth, addressing the subject in the proposal's forward, which translates to read:""It would also have been appropriate to propose the prohibition of the dissemination and trade of crypto-assets to guarantee complete anonymity by preventing, by their design, any identification procedure. This is the case of a number of crypto-assets (Monero, PIVX, DeepOnion, Zcash...) whose purpose is to circumvent any possibility of identification holders. To date, regulation has not gone so far.""This proposal was only one instance in a range of actions and developments that will potentially hurt privacy coins, or at least limit their use. The South Korean exchange Korbit delisted five privacy coins in May 2018, following in the footsteps of the South Korean government's ban of anonymous cryptocurrency transactions.Also in May that year, the Japanese exchange Coincheck delisted four privacy coins, while the Japan Virtual Currency Exchange Association recommended that its members follow suit. And like their South Korean counterparts, these bodies acted in this way in response to new government guidelines, which effectively banned such coins.There are also bans or inklings of bans on anonymous transactions in other nations and areas, such as Taiwan, the Netherlands, the Europmean Union, and even the United States (or at least, Texas). In theory, such prohibitions will hurt privacy-enhancing add-ons for Bitcoin, as indicated by how mixing service Bestmixer was shut down by Europol in May.However, many add-ons are open-source and decentralized, and so can't be shut down in any obvious way. In addition, Bitcoin can still continue to operate legally even if anonymizing services or protocols are outlawed, while anonymity is built into Monero, Zcash and their ilk, meaning that they'll be targeted directly by authorities. As such, it's likely that more users will be driven toward Bitcoin, since they'll know they can use it on any regulated exchange, and that they can still make occasional use of additional privacy features whenever might they need them.Overall, the situation doesn't look too good for privacy coins, although with Monero still being the 13th most valuable cryptocurrency by market cap, you'd struggle to find any immediate proof of a decline in favor of Bitcoin, even if it was the ninth most valuable crypto in early November.But while there's a possibility that Bitcoin might take away some of the edge from anonymous cryptocurrencies, it's not necessarily the case that Monero, Zcash and other coins will even come close to fading into obscurity.Asked whether the recent 100-person CoinJoin on Wasabi Wallet was a sign that Bitcoin would make privacy coins irrelevant, Havar replied, ""No, not really. Firstly, it's not zero-sum, and I doubt Wasabi will be widely used as it's expensive and opt-in.""More damningly, experts associated with privacy coins argue that, while they boost Bitcoin's privacy to an extent, protocols such as CoinJoin don't really come close to providing the kind of anonymity offered by the privacy coins. For example, Ian Miers, a Zcash founding scientist, explained to Cointelegraph via email that CoinJoin doesn't make it impossible — or even especially difficult — to link Bitcoin transactions to specific identities:""CoinJoin does not offer meaningful privacy for customers and companies. Zcash shielded transactions do. Coinjoin effectively adds a small amount of uncertainty over the source of funds. In effect, it adds some noise. However, it is very easy to remove this noise by looking at multiple transactions and patterns. In fact, most of AI and machine learning is extracting signals from noise and it keeps getting better.""Miers doesn't stop there, going on to suggest that mixing services like CoinJoin can't prevent the profiling and tracking of users:""For example, if a Starbucks accepted payments using CoinJoin, one could still learn how many customers they serve each week and how much they spent. If a democracy activist solicited donations on a pseudonymous Twitter account using CoinJoin they could easily be identified and detained. If they cash out through an exchange controlled or compromised by a hostile government, then their identity can be learned simply by them being paid multiple times by that government.""""These are not reasonable issues for a privacy system to have,"" Miers concludes, adding that CoinJoin doesn't scale very well at the present moment in time, is expensive if used extensively, and would clog the Bitcoin blockchain if adopted by a majority of BTC holders. And while defenders would point to Schnorr signatures, Dandelion and even MimbleWimble as future hopes for bitcoin's privacy, it's worth remembering that these aren't close to being implemented yet.And from one perspective, this is unfortunate, because even if some might suppose that cryptocurrencies need to be absolutely transparent in order to legitimize themselves, it's arguable that the reverse is necessary if Bitcoin or any other crypto is to become a bonafide and widely used currency — especially when privacy is becoming an important concern for an increasing number of people. Regarding this, Bitcoin Core developer Nicolas Dorier believes that:“The need for privacy is growing as a counter reaction to repression. When a user once get his coins on some exchange frozen without any recourse, when his exchange is over complying from fear of regulators, the only defense this user has is to mix his coins for the next time. This distrust the user has on exchanges and payment processors is the source of appeal to privacy.“Havar agrees with Dorier’s views:""I think improving bitcoin's privacy is important for its survival. The lack of privacy directly attacks bitcoin fungibility, which is what makes bitcoin a useful currency.""This lack of fungibility could be a big problem for Bitcoin as it moves forward and tries to make the all-important jump to mainstream use. But on the other hand, it could be a boon for privacy coins, which, despite being curtailed on a number of exchanges, could end up being widely used as actual currencies, rather than primarily as digital assets."

However, the satoshi we refer to similarly goes back to the early days of bitcoin and the BitcoinTalk forum.It all began on Nov. 15, 2010, when BitcoinTalk user Ribuck proposed that 1/100 of a bitcoin (0.01 BTC) — the smallest unit that could be displayed on the interface, at the time — be called a satoshi. Although Ribuck made this proposal, none of the other users on the BitcoinTalk forum affirmed or denied his proposal. This may have been because the thread at hand was a poll where voting took place regarding the best Unicode character for bitcoin, which has nothing to do with units of account and, therefore, may have made Ribuck’s comment look out of place.However, when Ribuck joined in on Unicode thread, he entered with a question:“What's the plan for subdividing Bitcoins? Do we go in thousands like the metric system (millibits, microbits, nanobits)?”It was a good question, but a question that nobody was willing to answer, confirm or deny. As a result, the idea expired, and there was no action taken regarding Ribuck’s proposal — at least, not at first.Three months later, on Feb. 10, 2011, Ribuck made a similar comment regarding the unit of account denominations. But this time around, Ribuck’s comment felt more at home in a thread titled, “More divisibility required — move the decimal point.” This time, when Ribuck joined the discussion, he got feedback — eight days later, in an entirely new thread titled Bitcent, in which BitcoinTalk user Kolbas decided it was time to think about smaller monetary units recorded on bitcoin’s blockchain.On the Bitcent thread, a user commented reinstating Ribuck’s initial proposal, the user said:“1 satoshi = 1 microbitcent (smallest denomination)100 million satoshis = 1 bitcoinAre we agreed?”To which, another user replied, “affirmative.” And after that, it was all said and done: 0.00000001, the smallest unit that could be recorded on the bitcoin blockchain, became known as a satoshi from that moment forward.Although satoshi entered the blockchain and crypto industry lexicon in 2011, it did not become popular — maybe even a buzzword — until recently. As of late, more and more people refer to SAT, mention SAT in their podcasts, have campaigns that revolve around SAT — for example, #StackingSats — or price goods and services in SAT.Chris Mezzacappa, CEO of bitConsult, a bitcoin consulting company, said this may be because of price bias:“Coming from a finance background, I automatically think of stock prices and stock splits. [...] Ultimately, people want more of something and have price bias.”If a stock has a relatively high value, the company may decide to split the stock so that the individual shares become more affordable — and easier on the mind — for retail investors. The same psychology applies to bitcoin having a high price tag, which is why cheaper altcoins typically could look more attractive and affordable to first-time buyers when they enter cryptocurrency markets (think Ripple or even Ethereum).Mezzacappa continued:“There's been focus in the past on ""moving the decimal"" because of this. However, even with price bias aside, it does feel ridiculous buying something online with .001 BTC. I'm not sure sats will be the final answer — it's too hard to remember how many decimal places bitcoin has. However, if the whole industry switches to sats, it may become second nature.”As consumers, we are used to buying goods and services that have user-friendly price tags — whole numbers, or numbers that are rounded off at the end. But because of bitcoin’s relatively high price compared to the price of many day-to-day goods and services, when items are priced in BTC, they usually end up with relatively unattractive numbers — for example, $5 is 0.00057206 BTC, at the time of writing. However, SAT was able to change that and gave consumers a user-friendly number to work with — for example, $5 is equal to 57,206 satoshi, at the time of writing, which is not the prettiest, but cleaner than 0.00057206.Jesse Xiong, a JPMorgan Chase Quorum Ambassador, has similar beliefs as Mezzacappa. Xiong believes that SAT has become more popular because, simply put, “decimals scare people.”Most people aren’t fond of working with fractions and decimals. If things were priced solely in BTC, it could leave merchants with unattractive price tags that are likely to confuse consumers at the checkout.That being said, you should familiarize yourself with SAT — because it could be here to stay, at least for the short term. After eight long years, satoshi has gained popularity. Satoshi has created a more convenient way to price goods and services in BTC — without the price tag looking unattractive or confusing to consumers. Both price and price bias seem to contribute to the time lag regarding SAT gaining popularity, but all in all, the industry appears to have made SAT a meme in and of itself, finding their own unique ways to incorporate satoshi into our lives — like the lightning torch — and doing so in such a way that these events that it is involved in have caught fire and gone viral in their own respects, bringing satoshi along for the ride with it."

Bullish. The crypto market dropped off $19 billion as the price of 
bitcoin ...","Jun 2, 2019","On May 30, overnight, the valuation of the crypto market dropped by $19 billion as the price of bitcoin (BTC) briefly dropped from $9,000 to $8,000 — a staggering 11% within a few hours on exchanges like Bitstamp. The drop of bitcoin to $8,000 was not visible on charts of market data providers like CoinMarketCap because the movement occurred in a short time frame.","Bitcoin’s price immediately recovered to $8,300 following its abrupt decline, relieving some of the pressure from the rest of the crypto market and continues to rise in price as of press time.Despite the $1,000 decline in the price of bitcoin on May 30, the asset has performed strongly against the U.S. dollar throughout the past month.Ether, bitcoin cash, litecoin, XRP and other large market cap crypto assets closed that day with a 9% drop against the United States dollar, while the timely recovery of bitcoin allowed the dominant crypto asset to minimize its drop to about 5%.Technical analysts in the crypto sector, such as Josh Rager and Cred, foresee $8,200 as a crucial support level that could prevent the asset from dropping to the $7,000 region once again.The last time bitcoin’s price dropped below $7,000 was in a flash crash on March 17, when it fell to $6,400, triggered by the unexpected sell-off of 5,000 BTC on Bitstamp, which then led to the mass liquidation of contracts on BitMEX.Bitcoin has since demonstrated strong momentum, with signs of “fear of missing out” (FOMO) among investors, creating a vertical rally to the upside.Cred told Cointelegraph in an interview that, as long as the $8,200 support level is defended, a rise to $9,600 remains a realistic target and a high time frame resistance level.“I think the vertical rally is more a sign of FOMO and disbelief as opposed to something to be inherently concerned about. I’m looking at the $9600 area as the next high time frame resistance area if price trades higher. Closer to current price (which is pulling back at the time of writing), I think losing $8200 — the level price broke out from and thus nearest support — will take us to the $7300 area. Mid $6000s remains the best and final area for longs. Losing that level and staying below $6000s would shift my bias to bearish.”In the past month, within a 30-day span, the price of bitcoin has increased from $5,322 to over $8,700 by a staggering 54%.Caption of the crypto 1 month performance. Source: coin360.comStill, based on the historical performance of bitcoin and its tendency to see a major correction in the tune of 30% to 40% following a large spike in price, Cred noted that a 30% drop in the future remains a possibility.Throughout the past three years, bitcoin has generally shown sustainable momentum, especially from 2016 to late 2017. However, it was regularly prone to relatively corrections in short time frames.“In 2017 and years before that, Bitcoin would regularly correct circa 30% before continuing higher. I think we will see something similar, but trying to short this market presumptively is a bad play. Any significant pullback above the old $6000 floor is a dip I’m interested in buying, the closer to $6000 the better,” Cred said.It remains to be seen whether there are sufficient fundamental catalysts on the horizon that would push bitcoin’s price above $9,000 and potentially to $10,000, considering the lack of resistance above $9,000.$BTC levelsSupport: 7600, 7200, 6800, 6400, 6200, 6000, 5750-5500, 5000.Resistance: 8400-8500, 10000, 11500-11750, 13000, 15000, 17400, 20000, moon.The following factors have been mentioned in recent weeks as potential catalysts for an increase in bitcoin’s price:On May 30, at its weekly peak, the price of a share of GBTC, a publicly listed investment vehicle operated by Digital Currency Group’s Grayscale that enables investors to invest in bitcoin through a stock market in OTC Markets, hit $12.40.Every share of GBTC represents 0.00098247 BTC. As such, at $12.40 a share, the price of bitcoin on over-the-counter (OTC) markets essentially hit $12,182, trading with nearly a 40 percent premium.In its Q1 2019 report, Grayscale emphasized that the majority of investments in its products, including GBTC, came from institutional investors, which was at 73%.“Institutional investors comprised the highest percentage of total demand for Grayscale products in the first quarter (73%). This was also consistent with their share of inflows over the trailing twelve months (73%). As we have mentioned in previous reports, many institutional investors may view the current drawdown as an attractive entry point to add to their core positions in digital assets.”The overall increase in confidence and improvement of sentiment around the crypto market have also led the hash rate of the Bitcoin blockchain to achieve a 2019 high of 59 exahash, nearing its all-time high of 60 exahash that was reached in September 2019.As the price rises and mining becomes more profitable, the hash rate supporting the Bitcoin blockchain is expected to rise continuously in the near term, which could be considered a positive indicator for stability.Moreover, as Cred said, the momentum of bitcoin in recent months could have simply been primarily fueled by speculation rather than fundamental catalysts. Hence, it is possible that the sheer rise in demand among investors in the broader market pushed the crypto market.“As facetious as this response may seem, price rallied due to an imbalance between buyers and sellers (the former being dominant). The market is trending hard. Typically in strong trends, consolidation (as was the case before the breakout) leads to continuation. One can speculate over ‘causes’ for a move in price but it’s often just that; speculation.”Speaking to Cointelegraph, cryptocurrency technical analyst and trader Josh Rager said that a strong correction in the crypto market is still due.Similar to Cred, Rager stated that, based on technicals, bitcoin’s price could push above $9,000 and rise up to $9,400. However, the analyst noted that traders have shown a willingness to take profits in the early $9,000 region, which could lead to correction if BTC achieves a new yearly high in the near term:“If Bitcoin can hold and close above $8200 on the daily chart there is hope that it could continue to push up to $9400+ but I still believe that a strong correction is due.“And at this time after the distribution pattern in upper $8ks, the spring above $9,000 with sharp downturn would be a clear sign to me that people have started taking profit prior to the $9400+ level. Everyone was watching $9400+ to start taking profit and because of this, the move came early and it seems that many were front run by whales.”In the short term, depending on the ability of bitcoin to defend on important support levels, Rager said that there exists a possibility of the asset plunging to $7,000, if it loses momentum and sees a steep sell-off.While traders generally foresee a strong drop in the price of bitcoin if it struggles to float above $8,000, opinions differ as to the extent the asset would fall if it falls below $8,000.Some have suggested that the strength of the momentum of bitcoin may make it highly unlikely to see $7,000 again in the upcoming weeks. Rager added:“Many were waiting to buy at $3k and below, and the price moved up from $3100 as buyers stepped in prior. Many were waiting for confirmation in the low $6ks and price ripped right through resistance, surprising many as it went to $7k.“And now we see it again as many were waiting to take profits above $9400 and price quickly broke down as large volume selling put pressure on the price as we currently wait to see if Bitcoin will indeed continue to break down to at least the low $7ks with a possibility of pushing all the way down to $5700.”The rise of sentiment around bitcoin and the rest of the crypto market has led industry executives, particularly exchange operators, to become more upbeat regarding the short- to medium-term trend of the market.Cameron Winklevoss, a co-founder at major U.S. crypto exchange Gemini, expressed optimism toward the trend of the asset in a tweet:We talk about going to Mars all the time. We have no limits to our imagination when it comes to space travel. But when it comes to the future of money, curiously many suffer from an acute failure of imagination. The Bitcoin rocket ship is fueling up, make sure to book your seat!ShapeShift CEO Erik Voorhees put to bed the inaccurate comparison between bitcoin and the tulip bubble of the 1600s, stating that well-known bubbles have historically not consistently rebounded and achieved all-time highs.Tulips never re-emerged to hit new ATH's. Bitcoin does it every couple years. Anyone equating the two needs to explain this discrepancy."

The analysis was published in a new report from weekly crypto outlet Diar on May 28.","Diar’s analysis begins by comparing bitcoin’s distribution landscape today with data from August 2018, when the top coin was last trading in a circa $8,000 price range. The analysis focuses on so-called “Firm Size” bitcoin wallet addresses — defined as those holding between 1,000 and 10,000 BTC — and notes that such addresses now own over 26% of circulating supply, or $36 billion worth of BTC.Back in August 2018, Firm Size addresses held under 20% of bitcoin’s circulating supply, revealing a significant accumulation of almost 7% in under a year, the report notes.Since the crypto market’s recent bottom in December 2019 — when bitcoin traded as low as $3,200 — bitcoin accumulation to Firm Size tier wallets has tallied to $450,000 — the most rapid growth among any tier of wallet addresses, as Diar’s data indicates.“BTC at $8K: Number of Bitcoins Added/Lost by Band.” Source: DiarThe total value of these Firm Size wallets now totals $6 billion more than in August 2018, with Diar underscoring that the bitcoin analyzed in these addresses is neither stale nor lost — i.e. the majority of it has been actively moved within the past three months.Diar further notes that since the start of 2019, around 40% of the bitcoin that has been newly minted through inflation has been accumulated by Firm Size wallets — over 100,000 bitcoin.Even more noteworthy, the report claims, is the long-term trend of apparent accumulation by Firm Size addresses: since the beginning of the crypto bear market in January 2018 — after which around 955,000 BTC has been newly minted through inflation — these addresses have reportedly consolidated half of the new market supply.As reported, analysts from digital assets fund Adamant Capital predicted this April that the bear market was entering its final phase — accumulation — noting that bitcoin whales were accumulating the top coin in a pattern that echoed the 2014-2015 bear market."

This discussion should not be regarded as legal advice.Bitcoin and other crypto prices have recently been highly volatile. If you are holding bitcoin or other crypto, you may well not want to sell until the market recovers, when it is down. But if you owe taxes and the crypto market is up, how about paying them in bitcoin (or selling bitcoin to pay your tax in dollars)?Selling may trigger tax losses that can be used next year, too. And in at least one American state, paying tax in bitcoin is a reality. In Ohio, you can now make state tax payments in bitcoin. It's only possible to pay in bitcoin, at present, but the permitted crypto should expand, according to OhioCrypto.com.Ohio beat out others in the United States, such as Arizona, Georgia, Utah and New Hampshire, where efforts to accept crypto for taxes failed. The transaction fee is zero during an initial three-month introductory period and then 1% thereafter. Even if you owe taxes to Ohio, that does not necessarily mean you qualify.So far, this is just for businesses operating in Ohio. If you operate a business in Ohio and have a tax bill, you can register at OhioCrypto.com. All payments are processed by third-party processor BitPay. Payments are converted to dollars before their deposit into a state account.Of course, it’s important to remember the only big missive the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has given about crypto. Way back in 2014, the IRS ruled that cryptocurrency is property in Notice 2014-21. That classification as property has some big tax consequences, accentuated by wild price swings.  Related: How Crypto Is Taxed in the US: A Taxpayer’s DilemmaIf you owe $10,000 in taxes, you could pay the $10,000 in U.S. dollars. If you pay with $10,000 worth of bitcoin, as long as the crypto is worth $10,000 when you pay, you’re home free, right? Not really. You need to consider the sale you just made.The transfer of the crypto to the tax man is a sale, and that could mean more taxes for the year of the payment. If you bought the crypto for $10,000 the day you pay your taxes, there’s no gain. But suppose you bought the crypto a year ago for $1,000 and it’s worth $10,000 when you use it to pay taxes? That’s right, you have a $9,000 gain.Hopefully, it is a long-term capital gain, which would make the taxes lower, at least for federal tax purposes. Remember, California taxes ordinary income and capital gain at the same high tax rates. So even capital gain does not save you tax money in California, except for being able to apply your basis. That is, when you sell a capital asset, you should not have to pay tax on the money you used to invest.If you actually tax in crypto, or sell crypto to pay tax in dollars, you still have taxes to pay — because of your tax payment. You could trigger a tax loss too, if you had bought the crypto for $7,000 and transfer it for taxes when it is worth $5,000. These days, a sale might well trigger a loss, which you may be able to use.With crypto, of course, all sorts of transfers can trigger taxes. For example, payments using digital currency made to independent contractors are taxable transactions to both parties. The recipient has income measured by the market value at the time of receipt. Then, there are the reporting mechanics, which continue to be a big issue for many people.  If you are paying independent contractors with crypto, how do you report it? As with other payments to independent contractors, payers engaged in a business must issue IRS Form 1099. You can’t enter “1,000 bitcoins” on the IRS Form 1099.Instead, you must value the payment in dollars, as of the time of payment. In short, a payment made using digital currency is subject to Form 1099 reporting just like any other payment made in property. What’s more, the person paying the independent contractor with crypto just sold it. Whether that triggers a gain or loss depends on the payer's tax basis. The gain might be capital or ordinary. If you hold it for more than a year, the best deal is long-term capital gain treatment.But actually, gain or loss depends on whether the digital currency is a capital asset in your hands. Most people can probably say they are investors in crypto, not a dealer or someone using it in their trade or business. But it is worth considering. Ordinary income vs. long-term capital gain treatment can spell a big difference. You might have to pay only 15% (to the IRS) on long-term capital gain. But the top long-term capital gain rates are 20%, plus the possibility of the 3.8% net investment income tax under the Affordable Care Act.Remember, every time you transfer crypto, you might trigger a gain or loss. The tax basis and holding period are important, as is record-keeping. If you receive digital currency as payment, you must you include its fair market value as income. Report the fair market value in U.S. dollars on the date you receive it. If you “mine” digital currency, you have income from mining, and the fair market value of what you produced is income.

Furthermore, this asset is one of a series of cryptocurrency-pegged tokens which the company intends to launch on Binance Chain.The post states that BTCB are 100% backed by bitcoin, with the reserves easily visible as they are recorded on the public blockchain. Binance noted that using bitcoin as a backing asset for the new token allows for more convenient audits, as the wallets are available to anyone through the public blockchain explorer:“The blockchain offers a much easier way to audit a crypto reserve than a traditional bank balance tether.”On Binance, the token will be traded against BTC, allowing users to exchange BTCB for the native asset to which it is pegged.The post explains that creating cryptocurrency-pegged tokens on the Binance Chain will give users of the Binance DEX access to tokens that have their own blockchains and are not on the Binance Chain.Furthermore, Binance says that an increased selection of tokens on the decentralized exchange will result in increased volume and liquidity. Still, the company admits that such an approach compromises decentralization:“While this approach is more centralized than atomic swaps, we believe it provides a higher degree of ease-of-use to most traders. And most traders are already trusting Binance.com to hold their funds anyway.”In an apparently related tweet earlier today, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao announced that the exchange was about to move 9,001 BTC. In another tweet he posted hours later, Zhao seemingly confirmed that the transferred funds are meant to back its bitcoin-backed token:Changpeng Zhao tweet.

14,https://cointelegraph.com,"May 19, 2019",Inflation Bug Still a Danger to More Than Half of All Bitcoin Full Nodes,https://cointelegraph.com/news/inflation-bug-still-a-danger-to-more-than-half-of-all-bitcoin-full-nodes,"Eight months after the discovery of the inflation bug, more than half of 
the full nodes on the bitcoin network are still running client versions ...","May 19, 2019",Figures published by bitcoin core developer Luke Dashjr show that more than half of the full nodes in the bitcoin network are still running client software vulnerable to the inflation bug discovered in September 2018.,"This revelation poses some danger to the network, as software vulnerabilities are a clear and present danger to the fidelity of bitcoin (BTC). Now that the top-ranked cryptocurrency is in the midst of a positive price run, it is perhaps important that steps are taken to eradicate the inflation bug problem for good.As reported by Cointelegraph on May 8, research by Dashjr shows that more than 50% of full nodes on the bitcoin network are still running software versions of the bitcoin client that are susceptible to the inflation bug.However, from that time, the figure has fallen slightly from about 60% to 54%. This means that, in the last few days, some full nodes have upgraded to a more recent client software update.Back in September 2018, developers first discovered the inflation bug — which, in theory, could allow miners to inflate the total bitcoin supply beyond the 21 million BTC by spending multiple unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) in the same transaction.Given the nature of the bug, the developers kept it a secret, quietly releasing a new version of the client. An excerpt from the September 2018 common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVE) report released by Bitcoincore.org reads:“In order to encourage rapid upgrades, the decision was made to immediately patch and disclose the less serious Denial of Service vulnerability, concurrently with reaching out to miners, businesses, and other affected systems while delaying publication of the full issue to give times for systems to upgrade. On September 20th a post in a public forum reported the full impact and although it was quickly retracted the claim was further circulated.”One key takeaway from Dashjr’s analysis is the total number of full nodes on the bitcoin network. Most bitcoin literature sources put the number of full-node numbers at somewhere approaching 10,000.However, Dashjr opines that this number is closer to 100,000 and that the reason for this discrepancy lies in the fact that many sources only account for nodes actively listening on the network.Called listening nodes, these full nodes have open port connections that can be probed. However, not all full-nodes are listening nodes; some, hidden behind firewalls or configured to not actively listen for new connections, don’t have easily discoverable open port connections.To understand the severity of the inflation bug, it is important to know the mechanism by which the problem could be exploited. This process would involve a summary explaining of the double-spend attack, the inflation bug itself and the problems that could arise if left unchecked.Bitcoin’s early success lends itself greatly to Satoshi Nakamoto’s — the creator of bitcoin — brilliant solution to the double-spending problem that had prevented the successful deployment and implementation of prior virtual currency systems.By creating an immutable ledger with nodes validating transactions, it became almost theoretically impossible to spend the same UTXO in two different transactions.However, what happens when, instead of spending the UTXO in two different transactions, a malicious actor tries to use one transaction to spend UTXO multiple times? Because of the way bitcoin is engineered to work, this action would mean creating new coins virtually out of thin air, thus inflating the total supply — ergo, the inflation bug.Several successive updates to the bitcoin software have tried to improve the blockchain’s immunity to the first type of double-spend attack. However, by the Core 0.14.x version of the bitcoin software client, developers began to notice there was a possibility of a distributed denial of service (DDoS) vulnerability in the software client.The bug allowed a malicious attacker to crash nodes running the 0.14.x software version by attempting to spend the same UTXO twice. In this iteration of the bug, the objective would have been to crash as many nodes as possible and not necessarily inflate the total bitcoin supply.In trying to fix the problem, the next released update, 0.15.0, included features that inadvertently allowed a malicious attacker to double spend the same UTXO in one transaction. Instead of causing a system crash, this new bug caused older software clients to recognize such double-spend transactions as valid.Upon discovery, developers again released a new version of software before announcing it to the wider cryptocurrency community. However, several months after the issue ought to have been solved, it appears that more than half the full nodes on the network are still running client implementations vulnerable to the bug.Cointelegraph spoke with Dashjr about the implication of the inflation bug, to which the bitcoin developer replied:“The inflation bug is in practice a network-wide risk. It would allow a 51% miner attack to cause inflation (something such attacks can't normally do). The inflationary chain would only be accepted by vulnerable nodes and light wallets.”Expanding further on the dangers posed by the bug, Dashjr went on to say:“It makes what was thought to be a full node, actually just a light wallet in that one respect. If more than a small minority use light wallets, miners get to make up the rules.”Whenever developers discover a bug of this nature, the solution is always to get nodes to upgrade to a newer version of software that hopefully has features that eliminate the problem. Sometimes, this process may lead to the emergence of another problem — as seen in 2018, when solving the DDoS bug caused the inflation bug to manifest.When asked by Cointelegraph what should be done about the situation, Dashjr’s answer was simple and straight to the point:“Everyone upgrading to a fixed full node.”While this process is ongoing, does the bitcoin network face any credible risk stemming from the fact that half of the full nodes are vulnerable to the inflation bug? The answer to the question might lie in who really holds the true power in the network: miners or developers?In 2018, bitcoin developer, Jimmy Song expressed the view that rogue miners trying to take advantage of the inflation bug would find it nearly impossible to succeed. For one, Song said that not every full node runs the bitcoin core, a large number prefer to deploy custom iterations of the bitcoin client.The fact that some nodes do not run the core client already diminishes the attack because such nodes will reject the block containing the inflated UTXOs. If a significant number of miners reject the tainted block, then a chain split likely occurs.Back in 2010, during the “value overflow incident” discovered in block 74,638, developers published a new update to the client in less than five hours, solving the problem. The block in question contained a transaction that created about 184 billion BTC for three addresses, with two addresses receiving 92.2 billion BTC and the miner responsible for solving the block getting 0.01 BTC.The discrepancy only lasted for the next 53 blocks, and by block height 74,691, all traces of the value of overflow no longer existed on the network. Nodes that initially accepted the chain split with the tainted block soon began to revert to the chain split that didn’t contain the inflated block.The same applies to the inflation bug: Once the split occurs, developers and others on the network would begin to notice, as Song explained in this excerpt of his blog post, which reads:“Because of these irregularities, people on the network would soon have tracked this down, probably have alerted some developers and the core developers would have fixed it. If there was a fork, the social consensus at that point about which is the right chain would start getting discussed and the chain creating unexpected inflation would have likely lost out. If there was a stall, there likely would have been a voluntary rollback to punish the attacker.”For Song, given the economics of the attack, it is unlikely that rogue miners would want to employ such a tactic. However, the bitcoin educator said that hackers working for countries with anti-bitcoin sentiments could exploit the bug to destroy the network."

in an effort to prove they are Satoshi Nakamoto. 5367 Total views.","Jun 7, 2019","The real identity of Bitcoin’s founder, Satoshi Nakamoto, has been a mystery since the inception of the preeminent cryptocurrency over a decade ago.","Over the last 10 years, various people have claimed to be the mysterious Satoshi, but their assertions have always been met with skepticism and have lacked any substantial evidence to prove the point.This has seemingly come to a head over the last couple of months, as a number of people have gone a step further than claiming to be Bitcoin’s founder by filing copyright and trademark claims to the original Bitcoin white paper and the early code that birthed the cryptocurrency.Cointelegraph explores the latest claims to the proverbial crypto’s Iron Throne and the possible reasons why people are trying to declare ownership of the open-source, decentralized cryptocurrency.Australian businessman Craig Wright has long been a divisive figure in the cryptocurrency community, having claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto from 2015 onward. His claims have surged in 2019, and Wright has gone to great lengths to try to prove his point, even suing the likes of bitcoin cash proponent Roger Ver and well-known crypto podcaster Peter McCormack for libel — after they’d vocally questioned his claims on social media.Wright’s latest efforts to “prove” that he is Satoshi culminated in his legal representatives filing a copyright claim to the Bitcoin white paper as well as the early code for the protocol on May 21.The United States Copyright Office received Wright’s registration as the author of Bitcoin’s white paper, but the news was met with heavy criticism from a variety of industry commentators and experts.There has been plenty of speculation about the motives behind Wright’s claims. Nevertheless, there is no way of downplaying his link to Bitcoin SV (Satoshi’s Vision). Wright is the founder of nChain, the company that developed Bitcoin SV — and the cryptocurrency saw a huge price surge the week that Wright filed his copyright claims.As cryptocurrency author David Gerard told Cointelegraph last week, Wright’s claims are nothing more than that. The U.S. Copyright Office does not check the validity of any statement or claim made to a copyright.As per its official press release following Wright’s claim, the U.S. Copyright Office essentially admitted that it did not check any of the facts, it merely accepted the claim on the assumption of the validity of supporting documentation. The press release said:""As a general rule, when the Copyright Office receives an application for registration, the claimant certifies as to the truth of the statements made in the submitted materials. The Copyright Office does not investigate the truth of any statement made.""Furthermore, the U.S. Copyright Office conceded that more than one claim to a copyright can be registered, which is currently the case:“A registration represents a claim to an interest in a work protected by copyright law, not a determination of the truth of the claims therein. It is possible for multiple, adverse claims to be registered at the Copyright Office.”Just days after Wright copyright claim was registered in the U.S., a Chinese citizen named Wei Liu filed his own claim to the Bitcoin white paper on May 24.According to various news outlets, Liu is the current CEO of cryptocurrency market research firm Coinsummer. He was quoted as saying that he filed his very own copyright claim to prove a point that anyone can claim the copyright to the Bitcoin white paper.The news was met with relative fanfare on social media, as cryptocurrency enthusiasts celebrated the satirical nature of the second copyright registration.Further efforts by Cointelegraph to ascertain more details about Liu’s identity and whereabouts, as well as the accuracy of other reports, have come up empty handed. This also raises questions about the accuracy of varying reports, with some publications calling Liu a man and others saying the Chinese citizen is a woman, while there are differing reports of Liu’s previous and current employment situation.In an even stranger twist, there have been numerous reports that a company linked to the family of the late Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar had, at one point, the trademark for Bitcoin.According to documents from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, a company called Coin Legal Ltd. had registered the Bitcoin trademark in July 2018. A quick search of United Kingdom companies registered online shows the company has a sole director, Olof Kyros Gustafsson.According to Gustafsson’s Twitter profile, the Sweidsh national is also the CEO of Escobar Incorporated. While other publications have claimed that the brother of Pablo Escobar, Roberto de Jesús Escobar Gaviria is the signatory of the trademark filing last year, investigations by Cointelegraph could not verify the veracity of those claims.Coin Legal’s company details only list Gustafsson as the sole director of the company — there is no mention of Escobar Gaviria. However, the Escobar Incorporated website lists Roberto Escobar as the founder of Coin Legal.The history page of the website claims that Roberto Escobar established the general holding company for assets and value protection.It must be noted that a search of the U.S. Patent and Trademark database shows a number of filings for the Bitcoin trademark over the past two years. With so many claims to the trademark as well as the copyright to the Bitcoin white paper and code, it becomes increasingly difficult to pin down any proof of ownership.First of all, it is important to identify the jurisdiction in which a copyright claim is being made due to various treaties and conventions. Copyright, trademarks and patents in a global context are under the jurisdiction of the World Intellectual Property Organization. In the United States, copyright law is governed by the Lanham Act, also known as the Copyright Act of 1976, which provides the framework for existing copyright law in the country.Internationally speaking, creative works are protected by various international treaties and conventions. Attorney Andrew Rossow points to one particular issue that holds significant weight:“There are a number of international treaties and conventions that provide protection for creative works. The Berne Convention is the most important international treaty that addresses international protection for copyright. It prohibits member countries from imposing “formalities” on copyright protection, in the sense that the enjoyment and exercise of copyright be subject to any formality except in the country of origin.”An important consideration in the ongoing debate around Bitcoin is whether a copyright registration proves that a specific person is the owner or creator of the work. The important thing here is to highlight the difference between “copyright registration and the granting of a copyright,"" Rossow added, pointing out that it is common for individuals to confuse the two.Firstly, under U.S. copyright law, an individual is granted copyright protection for original works they’ve authored in any medium of expression that can be perceived, copied or communicated. Rossow also explained that copyright registration gives the holder a legal reference to use:“Registration, while not required, gives the copyright holder the ability to defend their work in court. Specifically, it allows the copyright holder to place on record, a verifiable account of the date and content of the work in question, so that in the event a legal claim arises, the copyright owner can produce a copy of the work.”The case of Liu registering a second copyright claim on the Bitcoin white paper provides another interest legal scenario. A claim on the copyright could lead to a case of joint authorship if two or more people were responsible for creating a piece of intellectual property in question.In trying to piece together the reasoning for Wright’s claim to the Bitcoin copyright, Rossow believes there are two possible reasons: Wright could be claiming to indeed be a co-author of the Bitcoin white paper, or he is claiming to be the only author and is therefore claiming infringement of the document.So, the copyright grants its holder two types of rights: economic and moral. Economic rights allow the holder to receive financial rewards from the use of their works by others. Meanwhile moral rights give authors different means of preserving and protecting the link to their work.Perhaps the most telling takeaway from this debacle is the fact that the U.S. Copyright Office does not check if applicants’ claims to a copyright are valid.This is a problem facing the Copyright Office in modern times, and a scenario like this shines a light on that glaring shortcoming, as Rossow conceded: “It’s not the job for the Copyright Office to determine accuracy — that’s where the legal system and courts come in.” Nevertheless, Rossow maintains that “the value of a copyright is never taken away.”Overall, the motives of Wright remain a bit of a mystery. Some have speculated that the copyright claim was required to carry out a number of libel lawsuits mentioned earlier in this article.However, it is worth noting that if Wright was looking to carry out further litigious action, the original copyright needs to have happened in a country that subscribes to an international treaty.But what makes matters even stranger are the two other trademark claims that have been launched by relatively unknown parties, whose agendas we can only speculate about.The fact that people with wildly different backgrounds have tried to stake a claim to the Bitcoin copyright and trademark leaves so many unanswered questions.Are these parties just doing this for personal gain? Is Satoshi really trying to prove his real identity?Over the past decade, shady characters have been part and parcel of the cryptocurrency community. The initial coin offering rush in 2017 was a good example of how many people rushed into the space to scam unwitting investors to make a quick buck.These latest claims could be just that. The only thing that will prove otherwise is substantial, undeniable evidence linking these various claimants to Bitcoin. Until that point, the cryptocurrency community will continue to be skeptical of such claims."

a ...","Apr 27, 2019","Marcello Minenna is the director of the quantitative analysis and financial innovation unit in Consob (Italian Companies and Exchange Commission), —Italian government’s authority responsible for regulating the Italian securities market — as well as an adjunct professor of stochastic finance at the London Graduate School of Mathematical Finance and at Luigi Bocconi University of Milan. He is an economic and financial columnist featured on leading Italian and international publications.","The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.Sixteen months after from a peak value of $19,100, bitcoin is now hovering around $5,000. Despite its wide distance from the historical maximum, today’s price is good news for the market, as the recent rise could be the end of the collapse produced by the violent explosion of the digital currency bubble in 2018. From December 2017, the price of every digital asset has fallen, on average, 80%; for bitcoin, it has been the second collapse ever recorded, a violent fall even for an unconventional asset that has historically shown very marked boom-and-bust cycles. In 2011, the price declined by 93% — to $2 from a maximum of $39 — while in 2013, in just a few weeks, the price exploded to $1,151 to decline later to $177 over a 12-month period.It is not certain that, this time, the bottom has been touched, despite the encouraging developments of the last weeks: Historically, the phase of rapid decline is followed by a stagnation of the price that can even last years, named in jargon as a ""crypto winter.""In the context of a widespread speculative bubble that the so-called “altcoins” have turned out to be, apart from any technical evaluation, simple variants more volatile and less liquid than bitcoin, almost perfectly correlated with each other. This feature made any attempt to diversify the risk between different crypto-assets futile.Among altcoins, a specific mention should go to Ethereum; this is the digital currency classified as second in terms of capitalization that has been exploited as a technical platform for the proliferation of the initial coin offerings (ICOs). These ICOs have been exploited to cover real public purchase offers by collecting financial resources sheltered from regulators and by financing dubiously weak or shady projects. Most of these initiatives have invariably destroyed economic resources or turned out to be real scams in which investors' defensive capabilities were substantially nullified.Ex-post, the price pattern during the bitcoin bubble closely followed the asymmetric behavior of its historical cousins, starting with the Tulipan bubble of 1637, passing through that of the South Sea Company up to the most recent burst of the dot-com bubble of 1999-2000.After a phase of moderate rise, a very rapid manic phase of vertical price growth of about nine months followed, with a final buying hysteria in December 2017 — the month in which the price more than doubled, starting from an already very high base. The summit was touched with a classic ""double peak"" in January 2018, synchronized — not surprisingly — with the achievement of the maxima on global stock markets and with the peak of liquidity released into the global economy by the main central banks. Since then, the price of bitcoin has had an almost uninterrupted decline, with very rapid collapses, and shorter and less convincing recoveries, with descending relative maxima.On the subject, we must consider that bitcoin, its clones and the rest of the digital currencies do not have their own intrinsic value. Prices are simply determined by the intersection of demand and supply on individual exchange markets; these are often highly illiquid prices, differing from each other by hundreds of euros without effective arbitrage between the various markets due to the structural limits of bitcoin and settlement platforms. Therefore, it is very difficult to think of determining what the fair value could be.Often for traders operating on these markets, the technical analysis is the only tool for interpreting price movements. This paradoxically means that the price dynamic, determined by the collective actions of the traders, sometimes follows the forecasting patterns of the technical analysis.Under this overall picture, it is worth trying to isolate the main drivers of the rise and fall of bitcoin and other altcoins. The role played by the stablecoin tether has been predominant in the phase of the rapid price increase between March and December 2017.A stablecoin is a digital currency anchored with a fixed exchange rate to a fiat currency traded on the forex market, such as the dollar or the euro. Its existence is justified by the fact that, at present, the conversion between fiat and digital currencies is still slow and cumbersome, given that it requires a funds transfer from traditional banks to crypto exchanges via cross-border banks’ payment systems, whose settlement may require several days.The conversion between digital currencies is instead instantaneous and allows traders to protect themselves by using stablecoins from the very high volatility of bitcoin’s and altcoins’ prices. Of course, 1 tether is not equivalent to $1 because it cannot be freely converted, although the company itself has always declared to hold a reserve of dollars corresponding to the quantity of tether issued and circulating on the exchanges. However, for traders, tether performs the same function of the dollar, so it is irrelevant whether there is or is not full or partial convertibility.In April 2019, there are at least eight different stablecoins on the market offering the same tether service, but in 2017, tether substantially managed a monopoly that heavily influenced the price trend on the various exchanges, as evidenced by a statistical analysis made by the University of Austin, Texas. What’s happened has a lot to do with the fact that the company that issued tether was de facto controlled by the largest crypto exchange in Asia, Bitfinex.By examining the data (see figures above) we can observe how the price behavior of bitcoin (and of the other altcoins) in the “pump” phase of the bubble is perfectly correlated with the issuing of new tether on the exchanges. As the aforementioned research shows, it is statistically probable that the Bitfinex exchange has artificially fueled the manic buying of digital currencies through the issuing of increasing amounts of tether. In a phase of exponential price rise, the issuing of tether without adequate coverage in dollars is a profitable strategy. In fact, speculators could buy digital currencies with newly minted tether, counting on being able to resell them at a higher price later and replenish the dollar reserves. The signal of strong price increases in increasingly accelerated times contributed to the growth of the media hype on digital currencies, which attracted retail investors with little experience in digital assets, often unaware of the enormous risks related to the terminal phase of a speculative bubble.The long price contraction, perhaps not yet completed despite the recent recovery in prices, was caused by two main factors operating in two distinct time phases. Between January and April 2018, the decline was demand-driven and therefore determined by the flight of frightened speculative investors, highly exposed to losses due to the purchases made at very high prices. In this classic panic-selling, it can be noted that the support of a growing issue of tether was also lacking on the exchanges. In fact, since February, the growth of tether in circulation has slowed down and flattened out; this is indicative of the fact that, in a declining market, the strategy of issuing uncovered tether was no longer profitable.In June 2018, the price apparently found a floor at around $6,000, a level still over 10 times greater than the price that bitcoin had at the beginning of 2017. At this point, the majority of speculative investors has already disappeared, and the volatility of digital currencies was drastically reduced as trades gradually became thinner (see figure below). Many analysts believed that, at this stage, $6,000 was the minimum level necessary to offset the energy costs of the miners that were digitally ""coining"" the new crypto assets. Until then, the need of a widening population of miners to catch cover rising production costs was a force that supported the price growth of digital assets.However, this fragile balance did not hold. In November 2018, the announcement of another hard fork between digital currencies that aimed to coin a new bitcoin clone without substantial innovations caused a price earthquake that broke the fragile equilibrium achieved. In this deteriorating framework, the determining factor of the price decline seemed to be offer-driven and related to the digital currencies mining community. In fact, a substantial share of miners abruptly shifted its computing power (or hash rate) from bitcoin toward clone-currencies in the hope to reap risk-free profits from the blockchain fork, as already happened several times in the ascending phase of the bubble.But at the end of 2018, things were changing: The anomalous shift in computing power took away support for bitcoin and dragged the price of digital assets in a downward spiral, including the clone currencies on which the miners had heavily invested. As a consequence, a part of the miners, which was already operating at a loss before this downturn, has been thrown out of the market, causing — for the first time ever — a decline of the overall computing power of the bitcoin network, which collapsed by 50% in just a few weeks (see figure below). In this short period of time, bitcoin and the altcoins went in a free-fall never experienced in the demand-driven phase of the bursting of the bubble, suffering losses in the order of 70%.In 2019, the ""Darwinian selection"" of miners seems to have stopped, as testified by the recovery of the overall network hash rate — albeit at a more moderate rate. The bitcoin protocol provides an automatic mechanism of autoregulation such that the cost of currency’s mining tends to fall in the face of a decline in the network computing power. This periodic adjustment allows marginal operators to return to the market at lower costs.In the early months of the year, cryptocurrencies slowly regained value, but the real surprise came on April 2, when, in just one hour, bitcoin spiked by almost $1,000, surpassing $5,000 — a new resistance that has basically held up over the weeks since.It is not clear what the reason for this jump was (perhaps an algorithmically generated order or a liquidity squeeze connected to bitcoin derivatives followed by a forced buy-in on market makers’ quotes). After all, recently, various analysts had forecast a surge in the short term, and knowing the trigger event matters little. The real question is whether the market is heading back into bull mode. Multiple factors support an affirmative answer: the gradual recovery of the market capitalization of some stablecoins — tether first (see figure below) — the wear of the resources available to the bears, the albeit moderate return of various central banks to an accommodating monetary policy and the uncertainty linked to relevant phenomena on a global scale (the Libyan crisis, trade tensions, the Brexit conundrum and forthcoming European Union elections) that increases the appeal of digital currencies.2019 could prove to be a new starting point for digital currencies, given the slow recovery of investors’ interest. Investments in technological innovation and infrastructure have never stopped, and the interests of institutional investors go beyond the short-term speculative frenzy. Regulators are also gradually intervening in the reorganization of these frontier markets. The crypto winter may be less long than expected."

It is still too early to claim victory yet, but BTC’s uncorrelated nature has so far proved true,” an analyst at Delphi Digital said.Recently, digital currency investment firm Dadiani Syndicate was reportedly approached by a wealthy client to buy as close to 25% of the bitcoin supply as possible. Commenting on the news, EToro analyst Mati Greenspan stated, ""A buyer of this size is going to push the price up to make this kind of accumulation even more expensive.”Michael Novogratz, founder and CEO of cryptocurrency merchant bank Galaxy Digital, said that he expects bitcoin to consolidate in the $7,000–$10,000 range. “If I’m wrong on that, I think I’m wrong to the upside, that there’s enough excitement and momentum that it could carry through,” Novogratz stated."

It’s not going to be a winner takes all model.”Allaire argued that for everyday payments, which people may need to denominate in their salaried currency, or for transactions such as taxes, fiat-pegged cryptocurrencies will continue to see increased adoption. Regulators and governments, he added, will — and are already — find ways to cement regulation of the issuers of such assets.At the same time, however, Allaire said he believes that an increasing recognition of the value of having access to a censorship-resistant and highly secure digital asset such as bitcoin — a non-sovereign currency —  will ensure its continued growth.Allaire also gave his perspective on the crypto market’s renewed bullish momentum, noting that back in December — when the market bottomed in the depths of crypto winter — we saw long-term conviction investors beginning to build significant positions in core digital assets.This is now being boosted by rising fundamentals of cryptocurrencies’ technology, the emergence of retail and institutional platforms, and new regulatory frameworks taking shape, he claimed. Last but not least, he proposed that new blockchains such as Libra are being taken as indicators that crypto is becoming a mainstream phenomenon that is ultimately going to reach billions of people.As reported, both disruptors and incumbents — decentralization advocates, government and central bank representatives alike — have expressed mixed views about the potential impact and design of Facebook’s newly-unveiled digital currency, Libra. Yesterday, a former economic adviser to United States President Donald Trump said he thought that the digital token would represent a challenge for central bankers and was on balance a good thing."

The report states that more financial experts and academics are deliberating about bitcoin, and traditional institutions are taking it more seriously.Explaining the future issue of bitcoin, Zak Selbert, chief executive officer at Indexica, reportedly argued: “Think about it, executives will speak of good things they expect to happen on conference calls before they happen. They only mention mistakes afterwards.”Over the past month, bitcoin has demonstrated an impressive surge from around $5,075 on April 15 to its current price of around $8,178, according to CoinMarketCap.Bitcoin 30-day chart.

current maximum for Bitcoin of seven transactions per second, the team ...","Jun 10, 2019",Crypto platform ILCoin says it is developing a “modern alternative to bitcoin” without scalability issues by using “pioneering technology” called command chain protocol (C2P).,"The protocol of C2P, created by ILCoin, is supposed to solve the main problem of the Bitcoin blockchain — the lack of scalability — by enlarging the block size. The startup says that it has already managed to increase its limit to 25 MB. This enables its users to have a higher transaction amount: Instead of the current maximum for Bitcoin of seven transactions per second, the team says they hit 170.000 transactions per block or 15 million transactions per day (whereas Bitcoin can handle 375.000).The project notes that C2P is the first blockchain protocol that is synchronized with the network, which is possible because of the new protocol consensus that works with tree forms of nodes: The first node syncs with the community — it produces wallets — the validator node verifies transactions, and the admiral node controls the monitoring of transaction confirmation and digital signatures.Moreover, the company emphasizes that, unlike Bitcoin, where the control of the core code belongs to 95% of the users and any modification requires their approval, the ILCoin blockchain is fully controlled by the development team, which can make the necessary adjustments.The startup also says that the created protocol is dedicated to solving another main Bitcoin issue — i.e., the security challenge commonly known as a 51% attack of the network. C2P provides a safe environment for its users, as it consists of three different security layers. The “hack-proof vest” placed on the top of ILCoin’s SHA-256 algorithm allows blocking different types of activities and prevents blockchain corruption, such as double spending and rollbacks.The project notes that C2P is certified by a third party, an official partner of cybersecurity company Palo Alto Networks.The project was launched in January 2015, before the rise of bitcoin. During the next two years, the team worked on the source code, improving its security and developing online crypto wallets.The major progress has been made during the last year and a half. Since November 2017, the company released a new version of its Android wallet, web wallet and block explorer, which enables ILCoin holders to monitor their transactions. The startup also launched its own digital currency, ILC, which the startup positions as a “modern alternative to bitcoin.” Now, ILC is listed on 15 international exchanges, as well as CoinMarketCap.In 2019, ILCoin says its platform will be the “first SHA-256 blockchain implementing smart contracts.” Smart contracts will work in tandem with the “unique” audit protocol, which constantly checks the code for potential vulnerabilities or malicious changes made by bad actors. If such a change is detected, the smart contracts won’t be executed until all values get back to normal.In Q4 of 2019, there will be five different types of customized smart contracts available in five business areas, the project says. Each type will have its own rules and penalties. Currently, the SHA-256 proof-of-work (PoW) encryption protocol is already used for mining ILC.  At the end of 2019, ILCoin is also planning to upgrade all its online wallets and increase their security and connectivity. Moreover, the team wants to launch a new module, “Buy ILC with BTC.” The company says that users will be able to find and pair different buy and sell orders from various exchanges.Disclaimer.

impressed with Bitcoin's price performance. 8022 Total views. 169 Total ...","Jun 24, 2019","Former Wall Street trader and host of the Keiser Report Max Keiser was leading the backlash against the bitcoin (BTC) naysayers this weekend as the bitcoin price passed $11,000.","Using Twitter as a platform, Keiser focused on gold enthusiasts after several claimed that despite its performance, bitcoin was still an inferior bet to the precious metal.Among them was Peter Schiff, the veteran gold bug who has regularly trashed cryptocurrency both informally and via interviews while ironically also accepting it as payment.“It doesn't matter how high the price of Bitcoin rises unless you sell. Every buyer must eventually sell to realize any benefit from the rise,” he wrote Saturday.“But therein lies the problem. Once hodlers decide to cash out, the price collapses, wiping out paper gains before they can be realized!”Keiser did not accept his words, suggesting Schiff owed bitcoin a debt of gratitude for gold’s own gains. As Cointelegraph reported, a mixture of factors has seen gold make rapid progress in line with bitcoin in recent months.“Where’s the gratitude, Peter? Bitcoin has given Gold a hard money halo; igniting interest in hard money again, driving the price of Gold higher,” Keiser responded.In a further Twitter post, he added:“The (bitcoin) community now has a greater understanding of money and monetary history than the Gold community. This ‘flippining’ is relatively recent, and it explains why Gold Bugs are struggling right now.”Schiff faced further difficulties when he attempted to disprove bitcoin having intrinsic value. Long a favorite argument, he had touted it as a reason for gold’s superiority as far back as 2011, when he decried the idea of holding what he called “Bitcoms” because of a lack of liquidity.Bitcoin since mushroomed in value, one commentator noted this week, while gold never broke out of its trading corridor.“The only demand for Bitcoin comes from speculators,” Schiff further claimed this week, to which analyst Vijay Boyapati replied:“The vast majority of gold's price is monetary premium, just like Bitcoin. Industrial use does not protect that premium in any way. The premium is based on suitability as a store of value where Bitcoin excels over even gold.”Boyapati included a comparison of this ‘premium’ in gold, bitcoin and silver.Yet Schiff was not alone in his lack of faith, with Roy Sebag, founder of precious metals custodian Goldmoney, also claiming bitcoin users did not have an argument over gold.Schiff’s debate with ‘The Bitcoin Standard’ author, Saifedean Ammous, turned heads when it aired in May, the first in a series of high-stakes encounters for bitcoin proponents.The coming weeks will see both Warren Buffett and Nouriel Roubini - perhaps the biggest bitcoin naysayers of all - come face to face with cryptocurrency figures."

On Tuesday, its price jumped by just over 110%, leaping from about $62 at 1:14 p.m. UTC to $132 an hour later. Given that BSV had been having a rough time in the previous month, with a number of high-profile delistings, this dizzying price rise must have come as a relief to the supporters of the cryptocurrency and the company that created it — nChain.","And while explanations for sudden market shifts are often hard to come by in the cryptocurrency industry, some within the media pinned BSV's abrupt climb on the news that nChain founder Craig Wright had filed a copyright registration for the original bitcoin white paper with the United States Copyright Office. Given that this registration identified Wright as ""Satoshi Nakamoto"" — a claim Wright has been making since December 2015 — it ostensibly provided him and bitcoin SV with a considerable injection of credibility and authority. So, on the surface, at least, bitcoin SV's price rise was the result of Craig Wright being seemingly “recognized” by the U.S. government as the true author of the bitcoin (BTC) white paper, and the market rushed to get its hands on the cryptocurrency he now backs.However, this could show that Craig Wright is trying to ramp up his efforts to intimidate anyone who denies he's Satoshi Nakamoto and/or calls him a fraud. But even if the filing represents a new peak (or low) in his attempts to browbeat detractors and rival cryptocurrencies, some may argue that this reveals a high level of ignorance and incompetence. The copyright has no legal bearing on attempts to pass off a cryptocurrency as the “real” bitcoin, something that Wright claims he wants to stamp out.Wright has filed two copyright claims with the U.S. Copyright Office, with the office officially registering both of these in early April. One is a claim for the original bitcoin white paper, while the other is for most of the bitcoin 0.1 source code, with the nChain press release concerning these registrations summarizing them in the following way:""U.S. copyright registration no. TXu 2-136-996, effective date April 11, 2019, for the paper entitled bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System, with year of completion 2008. The registration recognizes the author as Craig Steven Wright, using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto.""""U.S. copyright registration no. TX-8-708-058, effective date April 13, 2019, for computer program entitled bitcoin, with year of completion 2009 and date of first publication January 3, 2009. The registration recognizes the author as Craig Steven Wright, using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. Wright wrote most of version 0.1 of the bitcoin client software, and the registration covers the portions he authored.""There's no disputing that these registrations have been filed with the U.S. Copyright Office. Nonetheless, they don't provide any real evidence of bitcoin authorship, since — as numerous commentators have pointed out — it's highly unlikely that the Copyright Office required proof that Wright is ""Satoshi Nakamoto"" prior to registering the claim.""This copyright registration doesn't prove anything about who wrote the bitcoin white paper,"" cryptocurrency author David Gerard told Cointelegraph. ""Anyone can file a copyright registration on anything — there's no checking. You're just making a claim. Multiple people can claim the same work."" Indeed, almost anyone could register a similar claim, so long as they have $35 to spare and know how to fill in an application form.Several renowned figures within the bitcoin community are even more dismissive of Wright's copyright claim than Gerard. Entrepreneur and bitcoin core developer Jimmy Song told Cointelegraph, ""Absolutely not. The only thing it proves is that CSW is a publicity seeking con-man, but we already knew that.""In fact, such dismissals prompted the U.S. Copyright Office to respond on May 22 to the clamor over Wright's new claim by releasing a press statement. The key part of this statement is the first paragraph, which reads:""As a general rule, when the Copyright Office receives an application for registration, the claimant certifies as to the truth of the statements made in the submitted materials. The Copyright Office does not investigate the truth of any statement made.""As these opening sentences indicate, the likes of Gerard and Song may have a point. ""It is possible for multiple, adverse claims to be registered at the Copyright Office,"" the press release added, which also states that someone ""who intentionally includes false information in an application may be subject to penalties.""The press release goes into further detail regarding copyrights involving pseudonyms, once again affirming that no investigations were made by the Copyright Office. ""In a case in which a work is registered under a pseudonym, the Copyright Office does not investigate whether there is a provable connection between the claimant and the pseudonymous author,"" reinforcing the assumption that the office isn't qualified to settle the true authorship of cryptography-based works.The nChain press release did state that the Copyright Office registered the claim ""after receiving confirmation from Wright that he is Satoshi Nakamoto."" That said, the office's press release makes it clear that it simply asked him to confirm for a second time that he was indeed claiming to be ""the author and claimant of the works being registered."" So, there's no indication whatsoever that Wright actually shared proof of Nakamoto's real identity with the office, potentially contradicting the nChain press release.So, if the registered copyright claims don't or can't prove anything about Craig Wright's involvement with bitcoin, the question arises as to why the Australian would want to file them. Well, leaving aside the unproven possibility that he may have been trying to pump bitcoin SV's price, it's worth viewing the claims in light of all the recent threats of litigation he's been making toward various members of the crypto community.For example, bitcoin podcast host Peter McCormack was served with a claim for 100,000 British pounds (around $130,000), after he had refused to apologize for asserting that Wright was lying about being Nakamoto. Likewise, Wright's lawyers had also threatened to sue Twitter personality Hodlonaut for the same reason, an action that contributed to Binance's decision to delist bitcoin SV, likewise with Kraken, ShapeShift and other exchanges and services.U.S. federal law requires that the authors register a claim in order to sue anyone who violates their copyright. So, in the light of Craig Wright’s certain litigious tendencies, the move would make sense. According to Gerard:""You need to file a copyright registration to take someone to federal court over a copyright violation in the US. If you do this within five years of publication, it's taken as prima facie evidence that your claims are true, and the defendant has to show they're not. But this registration is ten years since the publication, so it doesn't even have that force.""Not only does Wright's copyright claim not have that force, but there are other problems that would get in the way of Wright suing any of his critics or rivals. As many people on Twitter and other social platforms have already pointed out, bitcoin was originally released under an open-source MIT License. This means that anyone is free to reuse, copy or modify bitcoin's original source code however they see fit, regardless of whether they're doing so for profit or not. Because of this, it would presumably be very difficult for Wright to sue someone successfully, seeing as how ""Satoshi Nakamoto"" — or Wright himself, as he claims — originally declared that anyone could use bitcoin in whichever way they liked.The difficulties in suing on the basis of copyright claims don't end there for Wright, who stated in his press release that he has been ""dismayed to see his original bitcoin design bastardized by protocol developer groups — first by Bitcoin Core (BTC) in 2017 and then again by bitcoin cash (BCH) developers in 2018."" Likewise, a representative for Wright told Bloomberg that ""he will seek to stop the cryptocurrency community from referring to the original token as bitcoin because it doesn’t currently possess the attributes described in the research paper."" However, it's not at all clear how he might hope to achieve those goals via the legal mechanism of a copyright.As Gerard said, copyright has ""no bearing at all"" on the issue of someone giving their own work a name (i.e., ""bitcoin"") associated with someone else's work. ""'Passing off' is the sort of thing that trademark law is intended to address,"" Gerard added, ""but copyright and trademarks are entirely separate things.""Indeed, the U.S. Copyright Office states in its May 22 press release that it ""does not have an opposition procedure for copyright registrations, such as the procedures available at the Patent and Trademark Office for patents and trademark registrations."" And make no mistake, copyright is not the same thing as a trademark, which, as the Copyright Alliance explained, differs from a copyright in that ""it's a word, phrase, symbol, and/or design that identifies and distinguishes the source of the goods of one party from those of others."" By contrast, copyright covers ""the right to reproduce the work, to prepare derivative works, to distribute copies,"" and so on.In other words, Wright would need to register ""bitcoin"" as a trademark in order to prevent other groups and individuals from using this name with their cryptocurrencies and from passing them off as the “true” bitcoin. And it is not entirely certain if his new copyright claim is even registered because, as the Copyright Office has stated elsewhere on its website, ""Copyright does not protect facts, ideas, systems, or methods of operation, although it may protect the way these things are expressed.""Put differently, copyright protects the particular form in which ideas are expressed rather than the ideas themselves. As such, even if Wright could somehow prove his identity as ""Satoshi Nakamoto,"" there's still a good chance that he'd fail to sue anyone else for violation of copyright. This is because unless any potential defendant copies the bitcoin white paper or 0.1 source code word-for-word, there's unlikely to be any real ground for establishing that a cryptocurrency harnessing similar principles to the original bitcoin is a copyright violation.Craig Wright's copyright claim is effectively incapable of working as proof of origin or of acting as a means of silencing his critics. Though the bitcoin SV rally on May 21 would suggest that the copyright claim has actually had some effect, the fact that BSV rose by 110% within only one hour raises some serious doubts as to its grassroots legitimacy.Still, there is one thing Craig Wright has succeeded in, even if most people within the crypto community still don't believe he's Satoshi: He continues to keep himself in the public eye, ensuring that the media continues to write about him. As Song said, ""CSW does things for publicity and public manipulation. I'm guessing that since his attempts at fraud using cryptography have done so terribly, that he's trying to use the court system to force people to accept him as Satoshi.""The question is, where does Wright go from here? It's highly unlikely that he'll follow through with his new copyright claim and actually sue the developers behind BTC or BCH. If he does, he'll be forced to prove that he is Satoshi Nakamoto, and if he fails to prove this in court, he'll be at risk of prosecution for fraud (given his filed claim).What's more likely is that he'll continue doing what he does: threaten his belittlers with legal action, without taking his chest-thumping much further. And even if the new copyright adds a little more weight to the legal threats, most commentators believe nothing much will change as a result of them. As Jimmy Song concluded, ""Much like his previous attempts, I predict complete and utter failure."""

Researchers estimate that the annual emissions of CO2 ...","Jun 12, 2019","The carbon emissions generated by bitcoin (BTC) are comparable to the whole of Kansas City, and even a small country, according to a study published in the Joule journal on June 12.","Christian Stoll, one of the researchers involved in the project, said the large energy consumption generated through mining translates into a significant carbon footprint. And, as the computing power needed to solve a bitcoin puzzle has more than quadrupled since last year, it is a problem that is getting worse, the study notes. It adds:“The magnitude of these carbon emissions, combined with the risk of collusion and concerns about control over the monetary system, might justify regulatory intervention to protect individuals from themselves and others from their actions.”Researchers used data from IPO filings and IP addresses in order to generate their findings. With annual emissions of CO2 estimated at between 22 and 22.9 megatons, bitcoin is placed somewhere between Jordan and Sri Lanka in international terms. The study suggests that this level would double if every other cryptocurrency was also taken into account.Stoll, a researcher for the University of Munich and MIT, warned:“We do not question the efficiency gains that blockchain technology could, in certain cases, provide. However, the current debate is focused on anticipated benefits, and more attention needs to be given to costs.”Last November, a study reviewing the period from January 2016 to June 2018 found that it took four times more energy to mine $1 of BTC than $1 of copper — and twice as much as it takes to mine $1 of gold or platinum.A PwC report in March warned that renewable energy would not be enough to solve bitcoin’s sustainability problem. In the same month, a county in the United States state of Montana discussed plans that would nonetheless require crypto miners to use renewable energy."
38,https://cointelegraph.com,"Jun 7, 2019",Study: Over 74% of Bitcoin Mining is Powered by Renewable Energy,https://cointelegraph.com/news/study-over-74-of-bitcoin-mining-is-powered-by-renewable-energy,"Cryptocurrency investment products and research firm CoinShares estimates 
that 74.1% of bitcoin mining is powered by renewable energy.","Jun 7, 2019",Cryptocurrency investment products and research firm CoinShares estimates that 74.1% of bitcoin (BTC) mining is powered by renewable energy in its bi-annual mining report published on June 5.,"The report also claims that “at current prices, the average miner is highly profitable, with even older gear and high-cost producers currently able to make positive ROI.” The paper also notes that bitcoin mining operations are concentrated where there is ample renewable energy supply. Still, the report also notes:“The renewables estimate is down from 77.8% in our November 2018 report and reflects increased visibility of the industry on our part as well as movements within the industry.”The correlation between bitcoin mining and renewable energy reportedly makes bitcoin mining “more renewables-driven than almost every other large-scale industry in the world.” The report also notes that since November last year, the total hashrate of the network increased from 40 quintillion hashes per second (EH/s) to 50 EH/s.This means that — during this period — the growth of the computing power invested in maintaining the network was slower than its 10-year average but in line with the five-year average.The report also points out that the temporary decrease in hashrate (of about 40%) registered at the end of last year was the first registered instance in which there has been a major and prolonged decrease in the network’s computing power.CoinShares believes that the recent increase in bitcoin’s hashrate is caused by old mining hardware being powered on again after the higher price rendered them profitable to run, and the deployment of next-generation, more efficient, application specific integrated circuits (ASICs).As Cointelegraph reported in May, Canadian bitcoin mining company Hut 8 made almost $50 million in revenue last year but triggered total losses of almost $140 million. The company’s chief operating officer Andrew Kiguel noted at the time that he believes margins will improve if BTC’s price continues to rise.Also in March, cryptocurrency mining giant Bitmain was reportedly planning to set up 200,000 units of mining equipment in China to benefit from low-cost hydroelectric power in the country."

Thus, he concluded:“I think, you know, the doubters are having a really hard time continuing their cause.”Before, Trenchev also explained that he believes that the reasons behind bitcoin’s rise are increasing institutional participation, and the geopolitical turmoil (probably referring to the U.S.-China trade war). He also said:“[During] the bear market of 2018, we’ve seen even the harshest proponents turning skeptical at some point, and this usually is the inflection point from which, you know, assets start rallying again, but I think it is really about institutional support and implications that it has in terms of mass adoption.”Trenchev also hinted at Facebook’s Libra and JPMorgan’s JPMCoin as further catalysts responsible for the current rally alongside news concerning major financial services firm Fidelity joining the space and the Yale endowment fund investing in crypto. All those facts, according to him, are signs that people are realizing that bitcoin is here to stay.As Cointelegraph reported earlier today, Jeremy Allaire, co-founder and CEO of payments company Circle, believes non-sovereign cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin will continue to see growth despite the proliferation of new forms of digital assets such as Facebook’s Libra and stablecoins. Also today, news broke that ThinkMarkets chief market analyst Naeem Aslam predicts that bitcoin will hit somewhere between $60,000 and  $100,000 during its next bull run."

They don’t know s--- about operating systems. They don’t know anything about tools. They don’t know what’s going on in the future. They don’t know that we’re building icebergs, and building from the bottom up.""The bitcoin (BTC) market is in a somewhat similar position. The mainstream media has published quite a handful of negative headlines. A considerable population of traditional finance folks, who can't wrap their heads around the need and use of bitcoin, are happy to point at inconsistencies in the market to back their ""I told you so"" declarations about how they believe bitcoin is a farce.Jobs replied by comparing the way the press treats new developments to how people tend to treat a child whom they saw as an infant, disregarding the fact that the child might have matured considerably since then.In the case of bitcoin, the lag time is not only true for the press, but also for regulators and traditional finance professionals. Additionally, it appears that the crypto community is accepting and following the notion — perhaps unintentionally — by educating the public about how bitcoin and the crypto space at large are evolving. There have been scads of reports with the aim of doing just that. The latest is from Bitwise Asset Management, an American crypto asset fund manager.Bitwise has recently prepared a 104-page white paper. In it, the fund manager argued that the bitcoin market still has inconsistencies regarding trading data, but the legitimate part of the market has a ""remarkable efficiency.""The report builds on a presentation Bitwise had made to the United States Security Exchange Commission (SEC) in March of 2019 to back up its cryptocurrency exchange-traded fund (ETF) application filing.Here's are the most important points, with some perspective, from the report.As part of the research, Bitwise analyzed trading data of some 83 exchanges. Researchers said they looked at the trade size histograms, volume spike alignment and spread patterns of these exchanges. They concluded that there are only 10 exchanges with 100% real trading volumes, and these 10 exchanges collectively account for 5% of the reported trading volume.Bitwise classifies the 10 exchanges as real volume exchanges or reference exchanges. The 10 exchanges include Binance, Bitfinex, bitFlyer, Bitstamp, Bittrex, Coinbase Pro, Gemini, itBit, Kraken and Poloniex. Among the 73 exchanges that Bitwise condemned as displaying fake volumes are OKEx, HitBTC and Huobi.As expected, there were questions raised about the reliability of the Bitwise study considering that these popular exchanges aren't regarded as real volume exchanges. Bitwise pointed out that the trading data of the three exchanges doesn't follow that of Bitwise's real volume exchanges. It also referenced existing research that found similar patterns with the three exchanges to support its findings.Using the data above, the average daily volume of these three exchanges would have increased the volume of legitimate trading in the Bitwise study from $554 million to $622 million. But the researchers said that it wouldn't have materially changed their conclusion.HitBTC published a blog post in response to Bitwise's report in which it says it that it has a different customer profile compared to other exchanges, particularly those that the report branded as legitimate. That's because the exchange supports algorithmic trading, whose pattern is likely to noticeably differ from human trading. HitBTC wrote:""Different exchanges have different customer profile. HitBTC is among the first crypto exchanges to offer low-latency institutional grade (FIX) trading API. This is why the client profile of HitBTC differs from that of unmentioned but implied ‘reference exchanges’.""Low-latency trading simply means strategies that respond to market events in milliseconds, and algorithmic trading is one of those strategies. Bitwise did recognize the use of algorithms in crypto trading by pointing out that the average price deviation of 0.12% across its real volume exchanges is within the arbitrage band, adding that the trend ""suggests that institutional-quality arbitrageurs and algorithmic programs are in place that monitor the system and identify and capitalize on any pricing discrepancies to constantly keep the prices closely together.""OKEx, on the other hand, admitted that some traders engage in wash trading on its platform to quickly build their trading volume so they could enjoy a lower fee structure.With six of the 10 legitimate volume exchanges in the report based in the U.S., Bitwise argues that the crypto space is more regulated than presumed. Of the 10 exchanges, only Binance isn’t a money services business (MSB), while only the four non-U.S.-based exchanges don't possess a BitLicense, which is issued by the New York State Department of Financial Services. This level of oversight only breads transparency.The year 2017, marked the time when bitcoin attracted the most attention from the mainstream world, thanks to the wild bull run that saw the crypto go from just under $1,000 per BTC to nearly $20,000 by the end of the year. But, the following 12 months saw the price drop to as low as nearly $3,000 during a period that is widely regarded as the crypto winter.Bitwise research suggests that the bitcoin market has significantly matured over the period. First of all, pointing to a downward trend in the average deviation of bitcoin’s price on its 10 reference exchanges from the consolidated price in the broader market, research claims that the quality of the bitcoin spot market has improved.According to the chart, the price of bitcoin on the 10 exchanges deviated by as much as 0.25% to 0.4% between January and March 2018. The trend, however, levels out as of April 2018. Bitwise suggests that this trend shows the growing competitiveness of bitcoin arbitraging.Also, the introduction of bitcoin futures in December 2017 has attracted bigger traditional market players to the crypto space and has so far made the market more organized, according to Bitwise. The cryptocurrency space has seen the entrance of one of the world’s largest asset managers, Fidelity Investments, which has built a custodianship solution.Algorithmic market makers including Jane Street, which traded more than $8 trillion across all financial products in 2018, also started offering bitcoin trading in 2018. Other large algorithmic market makers that have entered the space include Susquehanna International Group, FlowTraders and Jump Trading LCC.These developments, according to Bitwise, have allowed the bitcoin market to sizeably grow in efficiency. The paper points at trends on how deviations in price are being rapidly wiped off the market as proof that institutional-grade tools are being deployed.Bitwise is currently awaiting a decision to be made on its ETF filing with the SEC. With this report, the crypto asset manager aims to alleviate the SEC’s fears and show the commission that the market has matured to a level where it can sustain an ETF product.When the SEC rejected an ETF application by the Winklevoss brothers last year, it expressed concerns that regulated derivatives markets such as the bitcoin futures market are small relative to the spot market. In turn, this would make it difficult to see through the unregulated, and possibly fraudulent, nature of the bitcoin market.By showing that the spot market is significantly smaller than often reported, Bitwise pointed out that the size of the bitcoin futures market is almost as large as the bitcoin spot market. Through this, the fund manager hopes to persuade the SEC to finally ease up on its concerns regarding cryptocurrencies."

argues that there will not be one single crypto “rule them all,” ...","Jun 21, 2019","Bitcoin (BTC), and XRP, the third biggest coin by market cap, are not competitors, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse claimed in a Fortune interview on June 20.","In the interview, Garlinghouse outlined the key difference of two major cryptocurrencies, arguing that bitcoin is a store of value or “digital gold,” while XRP is a “bridge currency” that enables an efficient solution for fiat-to-fiat transfers.As such, Garlinghouse cited the difference between bitcoin and XRP in terms of transactions costs, claiming that Ripple can do a transaction for a tiny fraction of a cent while a bitcoin transactions costs roughly $2.30 on average.However, such a difference “does not mean that bitcoin is gonna fail or something,” Ripple CEO noted, stating that he “[does] not view them as competitive.Garlinghouse expressed confidence that there will not be one single cryptocurrency to “rule them all,” implying that each cryptocurrency should prove a certain use case.Garlinghouse stated:""I own bitcoin, I'm long bitcoin. I think Bitcoin is a store of value and people hold it.""In the interview, CEO of Ripple also expressed his stance towards the current environment on crypto markets, pointing out that there is “a lot of bullshit in blockchain and crypto market,” and it is often hard for the industry to separate the signal from the “noise.”In this regard, Garlinghouse spoke of the media overhype around Facebook’s recently officially unveiled cryptocurrency libra, which is expected for launch in the first half of 2020. Specifically, the Ripple exec cited a title of a recent article on CNBC “Facebook Launches Cryptocurrency,” arguing that Facebook has actually not launched any cryptocurrency so far, but just announced their intent to do so in a year from now. Previously, Garlinghouse considered that a cryptocurrency project by American banking giant JPMorgan Chase “misses the point.”Recently, Ripple partnered with major money transaction service MoneyGram to develop cross-border payments, as well as foreign exchange settlements with digital currencies. As a part of the collaboration, MoneyGram is enabled to draw up to $50 million from Ripple in exchange for equity."

I ...","Jun 23, 2019",This interview has been edited and condensed.,"I don’t normally write the stories here at Cointelegraph — I edit them. But when I got an email from a publicist asking if I was interested in speaking with Ben Mezrich, author of “Bitcoin Billionaires,” and oh, did I want the Winklevoss twins to jump in on the interview? I couldn’t say no.Ben had the lucky chance — as he calls it — to already have an in with Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, as they had been portrayed as the Men of Harvard, slightly “bad” guys in his book that ended up being adapted into the film “The Social Network.” As Ben tells it, after he saw The New York Times article about their bitcoin billionaire success, a book about their crypto escapades that picks up right as their court battle with Mark Zuckerberg ends seemed to be an obvious next step.The timing for the publication of “Bitcoin Billionaires: A True Story of Genius, Betrayal, and Redemption” couldn’t be better or more ironic. The book spends almost 300 pages detailing the journey of how the Winklevoss twins have succeeded in crypto to the extent that it has wiped away the stain left by their battle over Facebook’s origin with Zuckerberg, only to then coincide with Facebook’s public unveiling of the Libra cryptocurrency project.However, Ben’s latest book involving both the Winklevii and Zuckerberg — which was reviewed by Cointelegraph this week — reverses his previous narrative of Zuckerberg as the good guy and the Winklevii as his opponents. But, as Ben explained, it wasn’t the writing that got it initially wrong, but the reality that changed the perspective over time. He told me:“I think reality flipped everything on its head, not just in the writing of it, but Facebook went from being something that everyone saw as this revolution and Zuckerberg as this revolutionary that was going to free the internet and make us all happy, into something much more nefarious, and Zuckerberg is now somewhat reviled.”And Zuckerberg’s cryptocurrency project has not been without criticism from those that align themselves more with the cypherpunks of the 1990s than with the Winklevii of today. That is an important distinction that Ben makes in his book, shown through the twins’ highly skeptical attitudes toward the manic bitcoin passion of Charlie Shrem and the slightly dangerous libertarianism of Roger Ver. The twins, albeit very sincere bitcoin believers, could kind of care less about the sacredness of decentralization.When asking Tyler Winklevoss about Facebook’s Libra project, I expected potential scorn, derision, maybe even thinly veiled frustration about losing some crypto limelight to a past adversary. But Tyler surprised me with his even keel:“So, first off, I think that Facebook being in this space is huge validation for it.”I waited for him to continue.“I think that if you are a company in 2019, and you don't have a crypto story or game plan, it's kind of crazy. And if you don't, I'm sure you’re scrambling around to get one.“Ultimately we think it's great validation in the space. I've read some of the technical papers and whatnot and it looks like it is evolving and they're still figuring out exactly all the details. But there's a plan to start, in some way move it to more decentralization.“It's still really early, and this is all one big experiment and iteration on the evolution of money. And I think it's really healthy that people are trying different approaches. It's not necessarily one size fits all.“If you're trying to be digital gold, decentralization may be the most important thing. If you're trying to be more like a currency, then perhaps you can give on decentralization for speed. So I think it is really good. All approaches are very valid and we'll sort of see how it plays out.”The main takeaway from Tyler’s comments throughout our entire conversation was regulation, regulation, regulation. Once you got past the “bitcoin does gold better than gold” standard line, he was ready to explain his somewhat unusual (what I would dub “hodler traditionalist”) views.For starters, he was not onboard with my joking idea about selling “Bitcoin Billionaires” for actual bitcoin:“Maybe you shouldn't buy it with bitcoin, because if you believe in bitcoin, it is going to only appreciate in value.”According to Tyler, there is no reason for bitcoin to even become a medium of exchange or a “good currency” because of “how regulation is allowing that to play out, at least in the U.S.”And now that he’s started speaking about regulation, he gets on a roll that is nevertheless persuasive despite being well-practiced.“We need to speak the same language as the largest funds and players in capital markets today,” Tyler said over the phone, in as far a cry from a cypherpunk as can be found. “I think it's just really important to do things the right way. And that may not be the fastest way in the short term, but I think in the long term, it's the one that ultimately will bring in the right audience and be the pay-off in the long term. Our sort of motto is: Look, we're just trying to be the fastest tortoise in the race. And we're playing on a game board that not everybody else is necessarily playing on.”“We're playing chess and, you know, there is checkers, but that's a different game and we’re not playing that.”When asked about the upcoming Bakkt physically-backed bitcoin futures testing, as well as the seemingly never-ending process of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission’s decision on a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), Tyler continued to play the role of the tortoise in it for the long haul:“I think that people, traders, investors and consumers will ultimately want to see the same opportunities to express opinions through financial instruments in bitcoin as they see in gold. But because we live in the world of cryptocurrency, there may be much more, too. There may be decentralized exchanges and more decentralized finance applications that you can't create outside of the crypto world.“I think you'd expect to see what exists in gold but also much more in crypto.”This attitude toward regulation, compliance and doing things the “right way” came from the twins’ negative experience with now defunct crypto exchange Mt. Gox, when they first started acquiring their bitcoin hoard. This is the main goal of the Winklevoss’ cryptocurrency exchange, the New York-based Gemini — to do everything the opposite of Mt. Gox.And according to Tyler, doing things the right way is really the only way:“We don't believe in hacking our way around regulation or being too clever about it. We are transparent. We go into the front door, not the side door or in the back door. And that's been our strategy and our DNA from day one.”According to Ben, Tyler’s passion for crypto and its regulation, obvious even over the phone on a group call, was one of the things that got him interested in the story and kept him interested:“If there is a really, really smart person who gets incredibly passionate about something and everyone else is telling him that he's wrong, that often leads to that thing that changes the world. People who are very smart get truly passionate about something, and you have to wonder why. How did they get so into this? That’s sort of rabbit hole that you go down.”In fact, Ben — who admits that he knew almost nothing about cryptocurrency before he began this book — has become a bitcoin evangelist in a way that is abundantly clear both in the book and in our conversation. He tells me this on the phone with the conviction of a true believer:“There's no question that cryptocurrency is the future. That's the way we're going. It's the science fiction money that we read about. And now, suddenly, it's going to be adopted by everybody in the next couple of years.”And Ben underlines that he was inspired specifically by the Winklevii, compliant, “right path” way:“If you just talked to the Charlie Shrems and the Rogers of the world, it would frighten me, because it comes from this kind of crazy libertarian, anarchistic, Silk Road world, which is not something that would appeal to me, necessarily. But the way I think the twins came at it was completely different, and that perspective really won me over and it just made sense.“The idea of digital money and the idea of digital gold — and something that you trust because it's math and not people — just made a lot of sense to me.”Ben’s goal in writing the book may have originally been to chase down his next interesting story, but his conversation with me sounds a lot like the Winklevoss twins in their early circuits of the crypto conferences — back when bitcoin was still in its nascency.And according to Ben, people have seemed to take his past books to heart — as he noted that “Accidental Billionaires” and “The Social Network” actually launched many people toward Silicon Valley — which could spread the bitcoin gospel even further.He told me confidently:“I think this will launch all these people into this whole new world of money, and not just that, but the whole philosophy behind it.”Tyler agreed with Ben’s assessment of the previous past influence of his books, noting that “if someone invested behind what Ben Mezrich found interesting, they’d probably have done pretty well.”Ben concurred, joking that a hedge fund had once even wanted to rent him an office so that it could pick his brain as he searched for a new book topic. He didn’t end up taking the fund up on its offer.Ben did add the caveat that “I foolishly never invest in anything I write about for a couple of reasons,” stating that he didn’t want to own bitcoin while also promoting his book, a highly moral stance for someone that also admitted he didn’t buy Facebook stock when writing “Accidental Billionaires” almost a decade ago.I was curious how the characters that were portrayed in a more negative light viewed the book. After all, Ben had obviously gotten close to them in order to write a book that detailed all the various ways that BitInstant’s Charlie Shrem could be sweaty.His answer also surprised me:“Charlie loves it. Charlie read the book and the first thing he did was he texted me and said he cried, and thank you, thank you, thank you.“I think Charlie's a complicated character. So, even though you saw him warts and all, it really was his story. So, he liked it.”Tyler chimed in to say, very seriously, that he and his brother Cameron are “cordial with everyone in the book. I’m friends with Eric [Vorhees], cordial with Roger [Ver], we’ve exchanged emails, obviously it's no secret that we've had our differences with Charlie, but that's all behind us now.” He went on, saying:“I feel like we're all cordial and respectful of the different viewpoints and opinions we have and paths we’ve taken.“Everybody's entitled to their different views and philosophies, and you know we don't always have to agree, but we can respectfully have our differences.”When I noted that his speech was more respectful than what goes on in crypto Twitter, he replied “someone’s got to set the example, you know?”As for speaking with Zuckerberg for the second iteration of the Facebook-turned-crypto saga, Ben seemed doubtful, but as he said, “you never know, you never know.”“I like to think of it like ‘The Avengers.’ You have ‘The Avengers’ as ‘The Social Network,’ and like the Marvel Universe, we go off into each character. Now, we're talking about Wolverine, and next we'll be talking about whatever. But it is really an incredible story that just keeps on going. And it's definitely not finished yet.”"

for bitcoin came from merchants in the first four months of 2019.","May 31, 2019",Research from United States-based blockchain intelligence firm Chainalysis indicates that only 1.3% of economic transactions for bitcoin (BTC) came from merchants in the first four months of 2019. The news was reported by Bloomberg on May 31.,"The low figure is ostensibly symptomatic of a speculative trend that Bloomberg suggests is preventing the cryptocurrency from being adopted for payments: as bitcoin continues to see significant volatility and renewed valuation gains, its nature as a speculative asset purportely disincentivizes users from using it as a unit for spending.Accumulation — or HODLing, as the industry acronym goes — thus appears to be in direct conflict with the cryptocurrency’s future as a replacement for fiat currencies. In an email to Bloomberg, Kim Grauer, a senior economist at the firm, proposed that:""Bitcoin economic activity continues to be dominated by exchange trading. This suggests Bitcoin’s top use case remains speculative, and the mainstream use of Bitcoin for everyday purchases is not yet a reality.""As part of its dataset, Chainalysis reportedly monitors crypto payment service providers such as BitPay, which reportedly processed $1 billion for merchant in both 2017 and 2018.Chainalysis’ data shows that merchant activity for bitcoin peaks during a crypto market bull run — as in late 2017, when merchant services hit a high of 1.5% of total bitcoin activity, before dropping to 0.9% in 2018 during the bear market and then rising again during this year’s recovery. BitPay CCO Sonny Singh told Bloomberg the firm had observed the same trend.Between January and April of this year, exchange-related transactions nonetheless continued to account for 89.7% of all bitcoin activity — down just a fraction from 91.9% for the whole of 2018, Chainalysis’ data indicates.This month, major U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase announced that Coinbase Commerce — its crypto payment processor for merchants — would begin supporting Circle’s stablecoin USD Coin (USDC)."

Describing the libra, he added:“This is just based on the dollar. I don’t understand it — is it called a cryptocurrency? Well it’s not.”Crypto enthusiasts praised Kernen for his remarks — and said it marked a turning point as traditional financial journalists are beginning to understand why established cryptocurrencies are valuable.In the following day’s broadcast on June 20, Kernen said:“I’m a bitcoin bull now. Have you seen what’s happening on Twitter? I’m like a god. Millennials are like holding me up… I love them, they’re so smart. If you put in a dollar, and your stupid digital currency is worth a dollar, that’s not a cryptocurrency — all the blockchain transactions actually do create some inherent value. Making a digital currency that’s based on a fiat currency makes no sense.”Facebook released the white paper for its global stablecoin on June 18. Mastercard, PayPal and Visa are among the founding members of the not-for-profit consortium that will govern it.Even though libra is being touted as a way of reaching the unbanked, reports have suggested that Facebook’s Calibra digital wallet will not be available in nations that ban cryptocurrencies. This is likely to hinder adoption in India, one of the social network’s largest markets and a country that’s home to the second-largest unbanked population.Reaction to the long-awaited project has been mixed.

The next best-performing asset, the Japanese yen, gained 2.1%.In addition, many assets saw a drawdown due to the trade dispute, which is ongoing; the Nasdaq Composite index shed 8.7%, making it the worst performer out of global equities.Grayscale also noted the depreciation in the Chinese yuan, a factor that others have already said spurred bitcoin’s bull market in May due to local investor uncertainty.“While the drawdown appears to be in its very early stages, Bitcoin is getting a jump before these risks are fully reflected in other asset prices,” the company’s director of investments and research, Matthew Beck, commented.The findings capitalize on a trend that has seen bitcoin gain from geopolitical instability at various points this year. As Cointelegraph reported, events such as Brexit appeared to exert a similar effect on the cryptocurrency’s price.While admitting bitcoin is still young for a hedging asset, Grayscale nonetheless confirms belief in its future potential.“While it is still very early in Bitcoin’s life cycle as an investable asset, we have identified evidence supporting the notion that it can serve as a hedge in a global liquidity crisis, particularly those that result in subsequent currency devaluations,” Beck concluded.At the same time, theories about bitcoin’s price rally in May also lean towards the non-political, such as investors notionally experiencing FOMO (fear of missing out) after April’s initial surge."

She has requested her co-commissioners to be open to innovation in the ETF space because a Bitcoin ETF, if passed, is likely to boost investment by large players.Facebook is in talks with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) about its stablecoin that is expected to launch in 2020. Chairman J. Christopher Giancarlo said that no formal application has been received yet from Facebook, but he went on to say that the regulator is keen to understand the coin better.Though the rally from the lows has turned around sentiment among traders, many skeptics remain. Venture capitalist Jason Calacanis believes that Bitcoin will plunge as it will be replaced by a new technology. On similar lines, research firm Gartner believes that the current blockchain technology being used by enterprises may have to be replaced within the next 18 months.Bitcoin (BTC) is finding strong support closer to the 20-day EMA but is facing profit booking at higher levels. This points to a range formation where the bulls buy closer to $8,000 and book profits near $9,000. Currently, both the moving averages are sloping up, which is a positive sign. But the negative divergence on the RSI indicates that the upside momentum is losing steam.If the bears sink the BTC/USD pair below the 20-day EMA and $8,000, a drop to $7,413 is probable. On the other hand, if the bulls reverse direction from the current levels and ascend $9,053.12, a rally to $10,000 is possible. We will wait for a reliable buy setup to form before suggesting a trade in it.Ethereum (ETH) is facing a stiff resistance close to the $280 mark. On the downside, the 20-day EMA has been acting as a strong support. However, we expect one of the levels to give way soon. The indicators are giving conflicting signals. Though the uptrending moving averages indicate strength, the negative divergence on the RSI points to a correction.If the bulls scale above $280, a rally to the $300–$322 zone is probable. We anticipate the ETH/USD pair to face a stiff resistance at $322. Conversely, if the pair slips below the 20-day EMA, it can drop to $225.39, which is a critical support. If this support cracks, we can expect a deeper correction. We do not find any reliable buy setup at the current level.The recovery in Ripple (XRP) seems to have hit a wall in the $0.45–$0.47919 zone. This is the third instance in which the bulls have failed to scale this resistance zone. Therefore, we suggest traders book profits on 40% of their long positions close to $0.45 and keep a stop loss of $0.35 on the rest. We will soon trail the stops higher.The moving averages are sloping up, which is a positive sign, but a failure to scale above the resistance zone is likely to attract profit booking that can drag the price back towards the 20-day EMA. If this support also breaks down, the XRP/USD pair can plunge to $0.37835. On the other hand, if the bulls push the price above the overhead resistance zone, a rally to the target objective of $0.60 will be in the cards.The trend in Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is bullish as it is still trading inside the ascending channel and above its 20-day EMA. However, the 20-day EMA is flattening out and the RSI has formed a negative divergence, which suggests that momentum is waning.If the BCH/USD pair dips below the 20-day EMA, it can slide to the 50-day SMA. Contrary to our assumption, if it rebounds sharply from the 20-day EMA and breaks out of the channel, it will indicate strength. The next target to watch on the upside is $638.99. We should see a decisive large range move within the next couple of days.EOS is facing stiff resistance near the $9 mark. The price turned down from $8.6503 and corrected to the 20-day EMA. We expect buyers to step in and support the digital currency at the 20-day EMA and below it at $6.8299.A breakdown of $6.8299 will indicate a loss of momentum and a deeper fall to the 50-day SMA. On the contrary, if the EOS/USD pair rebounds from the support zone, it can move up to $9 and above it to $9.60. Currently, the 20-day EMA is flattening out and the RSI is just above the midpoint. This shows balance between the bulls and the bears.Litecoin (LTC) has been consolidating between $102.4199 and $120.1518 for the past four days. This tight range is unlikely to continue for long. We should soon see a large range breakout. It is difficult to predict the direction of the breakout because of contradictory signals from the indicators. The moving averages are sloping up, which is a positive sign. However, the RSI has maintained its negative divergence for the past few days, which is a bearish sign.If the LTC/USD pair plummets below the 20-day EMA, it will drop to $91. If this support also gives way, it will indicate advantage to the bears. On the contrary, if the pair bounces off the current levels and breaks out of the $121.9018–$127.6180 resistance zone, it can pick up momentum and move towards its target objective of $158.91. For now, the traders can retain the stops on the remaining long positions at $90. We will trail it to $100 after watching the price action of the next couple of days.Binance Coin (BNB) has been consolidating near the 20-day EMA for the past four days. If the price slips below the 20-day EMA, it can decline to the 50-day SMA. As both the moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is in positive territory, the bulls still have the advantage. Hence, we will look for buying opportunities on dips after the price stabilizes.Our bullish view will be negated if the BNB/USD pair breaks down and sustains below the 50-day SMA. Such a move will indicate a likely change in trend, which can either result in a range formation or a deeper correction.On the other hand, if the pair rebounds off the 20-day EMA, it can move up to the resistance line, which has acted as a major barrier for the past few days. A breakout of the resistance line can carry the cryptocurrency to $40 and above it to $46.1645899.The bullish momentum in Bitcoin SV (BSV) remains intact. After a minor correction for the past three days, the bulls are attempting to resume the up move. This is a positive sign as it indicates that the momentum players are unwilling to wait for a deeper correction to buy.The first stop on the upside is the lifetime high of $254. A breakout of this can propel the BSV/USD pair to $307.789 and above it to $340.248. When a cryptocurrency is backed by news and momentum, it can continue to surprise to the upside for a long time. Hence, instead of booking complete profits, traders can keep scaling the stops higher. We suggest  traders book partial profits at periodic intervals because a vertical up move is usually followed by a waterfall decline.If the bulls fail to scale $254, the pair might remain range bound between $175 and $254 for a few days. A breakdown of $175 will break the momentum and can plunge the price to $152.015, which is 50% retracement of the recent rally. Considering the high risk involved, we will not suggest a trade in it.Stellar (XLM) has been trading between the 20-day EMA and the overhead resistance of $0.14861760 for the past four days. The moving averages have flattened out, which suggests a consolidation in the short term.If the XLM/USD pair breaks down of the 20-day EMA, it can fall to the 50-day SMA, which is likely to act as a strong support. Thereafter, the pair might remain range-bound between the 50-day SMA and $0.14861760 for a few days. Our assumption will be invalidated if the bears sink the cryptocurrency below the 50-day SMA. In such a case, a drop to $0.08641170 is probable.On the upside, a breakout and close (UTC time frame) above $0.14861760 will complete an inverse head and shoulders pattern that has a target of $0.22466773. We retain our buy recommendation given in an earlier analysis.Tron (TRX) hit our first target objective of $0.040 on June 2. However, profit booking dragged the price lower from the highs of $0.04156575. Currently, the digital currency can decline to the 20-day EMA, which is likely to act as a strong support.The 20-day EMA is sloping up and the RSI is in the positive territory, which suggests that the bulls have the upper hand. If the TRX/USD pair bounces off the 20-day EMA and breaks out of $0.04156575, it will move towards the next target of $0.050.Conversely, if the price breaks down of the 20-day EMA, it can dip to the breakout level of $0.02815521. Traders who have long positions can keep their stops at breakeven. If the pair struggles to break free of $0.040 during the next attempt, profits on 40% of existing positions can be booked.

Then, he declared:“I think bitcoin is easily going to take out its all-time highs.”Before making those price predictions, Lee also noted that Facebook’s Libra project is a validation of mainstream interest in cryptocurrencies. He also stated that he thinks this development “completely destroys this argument that says ‘I believe in blockchain, not bitcoin.” He also expressed his idea that — while he believes libra is going to be one of the dominant stablecoins — other stablecoins will most likely survive:“I don’t think that they are gonna drop in value because most of them are collateralized, I think the ones that are algorithmically stable just might not have the network effect.”When asked whether banks will support libra in the future, Lee noted that the decentralization of finance — while convenient for payment processors — results in a negative return for banks:“One thing to keep in mind: Facebook’s annual revenue per user is probably $50 [...] that may be a little high. But an average bank generates close to $1,000 per user, so Facebook has a 20x upside to their customer model if they start doing banking services. [...] I can see why banks aren’t really enthusiastic about this.”Earlier today, the head of the United Kingdom’s central bank said Facebook’s new libra cryptocurrency could have genuine use cases if it can conform to regulatory demands.As Cointelegraph reported at the time, Lee had claimed in May that the crypto winter is over."

Losses amounted to $136.7 million.Hut 8 currently operates 85 mining centers worldwide, with 2018’s mixed performance reflecting the fate of many mining businesses during the cryptocurrency bear market.As Cointelegraph reported, like stalwarts such as Bitmain, Hut 8 was forced to cut costs in the first quarter of 2019, reports surfacing last month of staff layoffs.“Due to the ‘crypto winter’, which was marked by a declining price for bitcoin and most cryptocurrencies, 2018 was a challenging year for all cryptocurrency miners. While many miners did not survive, Hut 8 managed its cash and digital assets conservatively to successfully make it through,” the earnings report summarized. It continued:“Today, Hut 8 is stable and poised to benefit from a recovery in the price of bitcoin. The Company will continue to manage operations prudently and with focus.”That focus will continue to revolve exclusively around bitcoin mining over other cryptocurrencies, with executives eyeing a continued uptrend in bitcoin prices in the near term.“Throughout 2018, Hut 8’s average cost per bitcoin was consistently below the market price of bitcoin,” COO Andrew Kiguel commented. He added:“As we move into 2019, we are poised to improve margins should the price of bitcoin continues to rise, given our cost cutting initiatives undertaken in late 2018.”"

Novogratz also compares the asset to gold, arguing that both have value as a social construct.Since bitcoin represents a store of value or acts as a “digital gold,” it is “not going to change the world,” Novogratz argued. He further stated that instead it is web 3.0 that “has the potential to change the world.” According to Novogratz, web 3.0 envisions a revolution in how networks function and data is treated as it is “a decentralized platform to process information. It’s separating data from the processing of it.” The investor noted that public ecosystems such as Ethereum and “lots of competitors are all vying for this space.”Comparing various cryptocurrencies with chemical elements in the periodic table, Mike also considered the role of altcoins, hinting that each coin will have “to prove themselves out” in order to provide a certain use case. On this note, Novogratz argued out that “there’s no one building anything on the litecoin blockchain,” as opposed to the Ethereum blockchain, referencing a recent tweet of his.Novogratz elaborated in his talk:“If you really think bitcoin is gonna win this store of value, everything else needs to be used for something.”Recently, Novogratz made yet another bitcoin prediction, claiming that the major cryptocurrency will beat its all-time-high record of $20,000 within the next 18 months.Meanwhile, crypto markets have rallied since Friday, with bitcoin surging over 10% today to press time, breaking over the $7,000 threshold after trading around $4,000 for most of 2019."

Clayton made his remarks during an interview with CNBC on June 6.,"When Clayton was asked whether an ETF based on a bundle of cryptocurrencies could be released in the U.S., Clayton said that the SEC is currently working on making that possible.Still, he also noted that various issues have to be resolved before a cryptocurrency ETF will be approved, starting with custody:“We’re engaging on this, but there are a couple of things about it that we need to feel comfortable with. The first is custody: custody is a long-standing requirement in our markets, and if you say you have something you really have it.”Another major concern for the SEC is the alleged absence of robust preventative measures for market manipulation. Clayton said:“The other thing that is important is [...] we have sophisticated rules and surveillance to ensure that people are not manipulating the stock market, those cryptocurrency markets by large do not have that; And we’re working hard to see if we can get there, but I’m not just going to flip a switch and say this is just like stocks and bonds, because it’s not.”Clayton’s views are seemingly in stark contrast with those expressed earlier this week by SEC commissioner Hester Peirce, who has urged for a less cautious approach toward innovation in the ETF space on the regulator’s part.Yesterday, the SEC also filed fraud charges against supposed cryptocurrency firm Longfin Corp. and its CEO Venkata S.

As previously reported by Cointelegraph, the entrepreneurs sold 50 apartments for bitcoin as of February 2018.According to the Aston Plaza website, the venture now offers studios as well as one- and two-bedroom apartments starting at 9 BTC; however, the website notes that price is pegged to the United States dollar exchange rate for bitcoin as of Jan. 8, 2018, making 9 BTC equal to around $147,000.As previously reported by CNBC, the project was originally scheduled to be completed by September 2019.However, citing government inspectors who visited the site in January of last year, The Times reports that construction of the venture has stopped. As presented on the project’s website, 25% of the project has been constructed to date, with over 400 apartments already sold.According to Lady Mone’s press office, The Times’ categorization of the construction as stopped is “damaging as the towers are currently being re-designed.” In an email to Cointelegraph, the press office noted that the clients’ money is currently being held in an escrow account.Mone had previously founded another crypto-related initiative known as Equi Capital, according to tech news outlet The Next Web. The Equi project — with reported involvement from Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak — was initially set for launch as an initial coin offering (ICO). Following a $7 million pre-sale, the ICO was eventually cancelled, with refunds issued to investors due to loss of interest and failure to make targets.The press office of Lady Mone told Cointelegraph in an email that the Equi project was stopped by them as they worked on their partnership with Wozniak, and thus cannot be considered a failure. The email notes that due to legislation surrounding security tokens, they have a team of lawyers working on how to move forward, with a launch planned for later this year.In February of this year, the UAE’s largest real estate development firm, Emaar Properties, has officially denied reports that it enabled crypto payments for property."

Smith emphasized the interconnected nature of various factors impacting the price of bitcoin, including political, technological and regulatory drivers.According to Smith, bitcoin’s recent price spike has been caused by the net effect of the trade war between China and the United States. The expert outlined the strong correlation between bitcoin’s price and the influence by Asian countries such as Korea and China, which have large capital controls.The founder of Digital Currency Group had expressed a similar sentiment earlier this month.Smith also pointed out the major public excitement about the emergence of regulated cryptocurrency platforms, including Fidelity’s institutional-grade crypto trading platform that is expected to be launched soon. As well, Susquehanna’s digital asset head noted a “tremendous amount of optimism” about the U.S.-based brokerages that offer bitcoin services to retail customers.In the video, Smith also stated that he does not position himself as a “bitcoin evangelist,” stressing that he is a market maker providing liquidity.In late 2018, Smith declared that he was still a long-term bitcoin believer despite the major bear market. At the time, Smith expressed his optimistic stance towards bitcoin, arguing that “every great idea is volatile.”Recently, a co-founder at Hong Kong-based blockchain investment firm Kenetic listed major factors that will make bitcoin rally to as high as $30,000 by the end of 2019, regardless of an approval for the first bitcoin exchange-traded fund by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.Bitcoin broke the $9,000 mark for the first time today since May 2018, according to data from CoinMarketCap."

This sharp rally after a long bear phase surprised many, including us. Analysts at JPMorgan Chase have said that, after the rally, Bitcoin is trading above its intrinsic value. They find some similarities in the current rally to the one in late 2017.However, we believe that a rally of such a magnitude was necessary to change the sentiment from sell on rallies to buy on dips. Fundstrat Global Advisors co-founder Tom Lee tweeted that the bear market is over. In a recent conference, he cited 13 reasons that indicate the end of the bear phase.The recent upsurge in prices has attracted investors back into cryptocurrencies. The trading volumes at the centralized exchanges skyrocketed in April. Notwithstanding, we do not expect a vertical rally from current levels. It is likely to be a gradual up-move. We may witness one more round of selling that will shake out the weaker hands before starting a sustained uptrend.‏Bitcoin (BTC) held the 20-day EMA and rebounded sharply on May 19. However, the bears are mounting a strong defense at the overhead resistance of $8,496.53. If the bulls fail to scale this level, the digital currency might remain range bound between the 20-day EMA and $8,496.53.A breakdown of the 20-day EMA can drag the price down to the next critical support of $5,900. We expect this level to hold.On the contrary, if the bulls scale above $8,496.53, the BTC/USD pair can rally to the next target of $10,000. The trend is bullish as both the moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is close to the overbought zone. However, we do not find any reliable buy setups yet, hence, we are not suggesting a trade in it.The drop in Ethereum (ETH) took support at $225.39. This is a positive sign. Both the moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is in positive territory. This suggests that the bulls have the upper hand. The digital currency will now try to move up to the $300–$322 resistance zone.On the other hand, if the ETH/USD pair plummets below $225.39, it will lose momentum. The trend will weaken if the 20-day EMA breaks down. Therefore, if the traders hold some long positions, they can raise the stop loss to $210. They can keep trailing the stops just below the 20-day EMA. Others, who have already closed the long positions can wait for a new buy setup to form before entering again.Ripple (XRP) triggered our buy levels recommended in the previous analysis. Though the digital currency bounced on May 19, the bulls could not sustain the higher levels. It has again dipped towards the 20-day EMA, which is an important support to watch out for.If the bears sink the XRP/USD pair below the moving averages, a drop to $0.27795 is probable. Therefore, traders can keep the stop loss on the long positions at $0.2750.Conversely, if the pair bounces off the 20-day EMA and scales above $0.45, it is likely to pick up momentum and move up to $0.60. Though there are minor resistances at $0.50 and $0.55, we expect them to be crossed.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) rebounded from the 20-day EMA, which is a positive sign. The trend remains bullish as both the moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is above 50. On the upside it is facing selling at the resistance line of the channel. If the bulls fail to break out of the channel, the digital currency might still move up gradually as long as it stays above the 20-day EMA.The first sign of weakness will be a break below the 20-day EMA. After that, a drop to the support line of the channel is probable. A breakdown of the channel will change the trend in favor of the bears. On the other hand, if the BCH/USD pair breaks out of the channel, it can pick up momentum and rally to $600.  Litecoin (LTC) bounced from the first support and scaled above $91 on May 19, but it is struggling to stay above this level. It is again back below $91 and might retest the support at $84.3439. The 20-day EMA is also just above this support. Hence, this is an important level to watch out for.If the LTC/USD pair slides below $84.3439, it can fall to $74.6054. If this support also gives way, the pair can drop to $66.47.On the other hand, if the bulls propel the digital currency above $91 and sustain it, a rally towards its target objective of $158.91 is probable. Hence, the traders can keep the stop loss on the long positions at $70.EOS found support just above the 20-day EMA, which is a positive sign. Both the moving averages are trending up and the RSI is in the positive territory. This suggests the bulls have the upper hand. However, they are currently finding it difficult to push the price above $6.8299.A failure to scale above $6.8299 will result in a consolidation for a few days. The EOS/USD pair will weaken on a breakdown of the moving averages. In such a case, a drop to the bottom of the large range at $4.4930–$6.8299 is probable. The trend will turn negative if the pair dips below the $4.4930–$3.8723 support zone.Binance Coin (BNB) made another new intraday high on May 19 but failed to break out of the resistance line. This is the fourth time the digital currency has turned down from this resistance.The BNB/USD pair might now correct to the 20-day EMA, which is likely to act as a strong support. A break below the 20-day EMA will weaken the momentum and if the pair slides below the 50-day SMA, it will signal a deeper correction.The trend remains up as both the moving averages are sloping higher and the RSI is close to the overbought zone. If the bulls break out of the resistance line, it is likely to pick up momentum.Stellar (XLM) has been consolidating near the overhead resistance of $0.14861760 for the past six days. The dips have been bought by the bulls, which shows demand at lower levels. If the digital currency breaks out and closes (UTC time frame) above $0.14861760, it can rally to $0.22466773. The 20-day EMA is sloping up and the RSI is in the positive zone, which suggests that the bulls have the upper hand.Traders can buy on a close (UTC time frame) above $0.14861760 and keep a stop loss of $0.1150. Contrary to our assumption, if the XLM/USD pair fails to climb above the overhead resistance, it might remain range-bound between $0.1150 and $0.14861760 for a few days. The pair will weaken if it breaks below the moving averages.The bulls are finding it difficult to propel Cardano (ADA) above the overhead resistance of $0.094256. Now, the bears will attempt to sink the price below the moving averages. If successful, a drop to $0.057898 is probable. If this level also breaks down, the trend will turn negative.However, if the ADA/USD pair rebounds off the moving averages and climbs above the overhead resistance of $0.094256, it will complete a reversal pattern that has a target objective of $0.161275. The moving averages are sloping higher and the RSI is just above the midpoint. This shows that the bulls have a minor advantage. Therefore, traders can initiate long positions based on our previous recommendation.Though Tron (TRX) rose above $0.02815521 on May 19, the bulls could not sustain the highs. However, the positive thing is that it is clinging close to the top of the range. If the sentiment remains strong, we anticipate another attempt by the bulls to break out of the consolidation.If the TRX/USD pair sustains above $0.02815521 for 3 days, it is likely to start a new uptrend that can easily carry it to $0.40 where it might face some resistance. The pair has spent a long time in the range, hence, the next leg of the up-move is likely to surprise on the upside. Above $0.40, the rally can extend to $0.50.Our bullish view will be invalidated if the cryptocurrency fails to sustain above the range. In such a case, the range bound action will continue for a few more days. For now, traders can maintain the stop loss on the long positions at $0.0209. We will raise it at the first available opportunity.Market data is provided by HitBTC exchange."

resilience due to continuing demand for new forms of value transfer.","May 16, 2019",Veteran frontier markets investor Mark Mobius has said he believes cryptocurrencies will show resilience due to continuing demand for new forms of value transfer. Mobius made his remarks during an interview with Bloomberg on May 15.,"Mobius is a seasoned and pioneer investor in developing nations and emerging economies, earning international recognition for his decades-long work at global investment firm Franklin Templeton. Last year, he retired to launch a new asset management boutique, Mobius Capital Partners.Having previously adopted a cautious stance toward crypto, the investor told Bloomberg yesterday that he believes that global demand for the frictionless and private transfer of value will continue to bolster cryptocurrencies’ development and markets. He noted:""There's definitely a desire among people around the world to be able to transfer money easily and confidentially that is really the backing to bitcoin and other currencies of that type, so I believe it's going to be alive and well.""Mobius nonetheless stopped short of endorsing crypto investment in unequivocal terms, underscoring the risks he perceives to be inherent to their decentralized structure:“Whether I would invest in it is another question, because it has incredible volatility and at the end of the day, you can’t trace one individual or group or organization that would keep track of what is going on.”As a proposed case in point, Mobius alluded to an unnamed Japan-based bitcoin exchange that “went bust and lost millions” — presumably a reference to the high-profile collapse of bitcoin (BTC) exchange Mt. Gox in early 2014, which resulted in the loss of 850,000 BTC valued at roughly $460 million at the time.“You have to be very careful,” he noted, underscoring that he himself holds no investments in bitcoin.Alongside his work at Templeton, Mobius was chosen to serve on the World Bank’s Global Corporate Governance Forum as a co-chairman of its investor-responsibility task force in 1999.Cointelegraph has previously reported on Mobius’ response to the hardline anti-crypto stance adopted by China — notably the country’s September 2017 ban on crypto exchanges and initial coin offerings — which he considered at the time would likely draw risk-shy investors back to gold."

The action seeks civil monetary penalties, including “permanent trading and registration bans, restitution, and disgorgement.”According to the CFTC, Control-Finance was soliciting investors to buy their bitcoin with cash and deposit it with the firm, as they claimed to guarantee daily trading profits on the deposits through employed professional cryptocurrency traders. The alleged scammers were further sending portions of new clients’ BTC deposits to other customers, misrepresenting those as actual profits generated from crypto trading.In mid-September 2017, Control-Finance suddenly took down its website, suspending payments to clients, as well as deleting advertising content from its profiles on social media including Facebook, YouTube and Twitter, the regulator wrote. Claiming that the firm would reimburse customers by late October or November 2017, the allegedly fraudulent entity reportedly diverted laundered bitcoin using crypto wallet service CoinPayments.Recently, the British Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) issued a warning against a fraudulent firm posing as the Swiss Investment Corporation, an FCA-authorized firm offering crypto investments. At the time, the regulator also reported on another fraudulent entity that is a clone of global investment bank Goldman Sachs."

In explaining the rationale behind ION, the blog post added:“We believe every person needs a decentralized, digital identity they own and control, backed by self-owned identifiers that enable secure, privacy preserving interactions. This self-owned identity must seamlessly integrate into their lives and put them at the center of everything they do in the digital world.”Daniel Buchner, a program manager for the Microsoft Identity team, said the goal of decentralized networks is to remove the control that apps, services and organizations have over digital identifiers such as email addresses and usernames.Microsoft aims to create an ecosystem where “billions of people and countless devices can securely interact over an interoperable system built on standards and open-source components.”Microsoft added that it plans to collaborate with open-source contributors so ION can publicly launch on the bitcoin mainnet in the coming months.Technology that gives users greater control over their digital identities is gaining traction, with PayPal investing in such a startup last month.ION is far from Microsoft’s first blockchain initiative. Earlier this month, it released a new Azure Blockchain Development Kit for the Ethereum blockchain, with Starbucks implementing this service to track coffee production."

Total ...","May 6, 2019","Outspoken crypto critic and Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett has again derided bitcoin (BTC) for its purported lack of real use value, likening the coin to a seashell that “just sits there.”","Buffett used this latest cryptocurrency metaphor during a press meeting ahead of the Berkshire Hathaway annual shareholders’ meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, CNBC reported on May 4.The CEO — who also serves as chairman of the ~$248 billion revenue multinational holding conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway — is well-known for his scathing stance toward cryptocurrencies, memorably characterizing bitcoin as ""probably rat poison squared"" during last year’s shareholders’ meeting. In his latest remarks, Buffett claimed:“It doesn’t do anything. It just sits there. It’s like a seashell or something, and that is not an investment to me.”To further illustrate his view of the coin as a merely speculative asset, Buffett reportedly stated:“I’ll tear off a button here. What I’ll have here is a little token...I’ll offer it to you for $1000, and I’ll see if I can get the price up to $2000 by the end of the day...But the button has one use and it’s a very limited use.”While reserving his ritual opprobrium toward bitcoin, Buffett — who has earned the moniker of the “Oracle of Ohama” for his ostensibly astute investment picks — did offer more positive remarks for blockchain technology. He is reported to have acknowledged its promise, stating that:“Blockchain...is very big, but it didn’t need bitcoin. J.P. Morgan of course came out with their own cryptocurrency.”In a further report on Buffett’s latest remarks, Bloomberg cites the business magnate as saying that the speculative fervor around bitcoin reminds him of watching gamblers at Vegas. Buffett reportedly professed that the phenomenon broadly reassures him that he can make a profit in a society where people continue to speculate despite knowing they are likely to lose.While Buffet’s vice chairman Charlie Munger has echoed the CEO’s opinion with his own asides — dismissing the bitcoin market and purported FOMO that drives it as being akin to trading turds — their self-proclaimed disciple Chamath Palihapitiya has disparaged their hardline stance.Palihapitiya — the founder and CEO of VC firm Social Capital Palihapitiya — argued in May 2018 that “technology is not in his circle of competence” in reference to Buffett, and that both chairmen are mistaken in their aversion to cryptocurrency innovation."

Novogratz made his remarks during an interview with mainstream media CNN published on May 9.,"During the interview, Novogratz also said that he believes that $6,000 is probably a stall point, and the next one will be $10,000. Moreover, he expressed the belief that this time, other cryptocurrencies “aren’t going to go up nearly as quickly.” He explained:“The other coins, Ethereum being the next biggest, Ripple...they have to prove use case, right?”Novogratz pointed out that out of the 118 elements present on the periodic table, only “gold has store of value just because.” This is in line with what he said in February, when he argued that bitcoin occupies a unique place in the cryptocurrency landscape, and that it “is going to be digital gold, a place where you have sovereign money.”Novogratz then stated that there are other elements, such as copper, that we value because we use them. According to Novogratz, just like copper, altcoins need to prove their use case in a similar way, “and that means getting people in their community, getting developers, and programmers, and being worthy of something.”When asked about how concerned the public should be about breaches such as yesterday’s hack of cryptocurrency exchange Binance, he said that “they should be somewhat concerned.” Still, he pointed out that “even the most aggressive exchanges only keep a certain amount of their coins on what’s called a hot wallet,” and that because of the reserves, no investor has lost his money.Furthermore, Novogratz said that he expects regulators to take action and added:“We think all the exchanges should go to a process where they almost self regulate, right? They do what the regulators want beforehand.”When asked why the prices did not react negatively to the hack, Novogratz expressed the idea that bitcoin is currently in a bull market, stating “in bull markets, markets can digest bad news. We’re in a bull market.”As Cointelegraph reported earlier today, when debating economist and notorious cryptocurrency critic Nouriel Roubini, Novogratz pointed out bitcoin’s recent recovery and concluded:“The debate is over, bitcoin won. It is now seen by people all around the world as a legitimate place to [store] their value.”"

He told Fortune:“What we’ve seen is that there is the ability to tie some of those cryptocurrency transactions either to the pharmacies in China or actually to the services that people are using to distribute fentanyl.”According to Levin, the transparency of cryptocurrencies is helping law enforcement to build cases against suspects quicker than in traditional finance, namely because investigators no longer need to rely on obtaining records from foreign banks.Even though bitcoin is overwhelmingly used by crypto criminals, Levin noted that Chainalysis has launched real-time transaction monitoring for 10 cryptocurrencies, as well as a basket of stablecoins, because law enforcement agencies are trying to investigate hacks on crypto exchanges where other tokens are stolen.Levin also said he has been investigating the case of QuadrigaCX, the major Canadian crypto exchange that was officially declared bankrupt earlier this month. The company lost access to cold wallets and corresponding keys following the CEO’s death in December last year, and reportedly owes more than $195 million to 115,000 customers.In the interview, the Chainalysis executive suggested Quadriga “was operating on fractional reserve and in deep trouble”:“We were looking at the bitcoin holdings and also tether holdings of Quadriga and what we found very quickly was that Quadriga as an exchange actually didn’t have those customer funds that were reported in the media to be lost. Those funds actually never existed.”Levin also repeated claims made in a Chainalysis report earlier this year that two hacker groups have been responsible for stealing $1 billion in cryptocurrency, representing the majority of the funds lost in scams."

Price Surge. Crypto investment firm Primitive Ventures co-founder ...","May 30, 2019",Co-founder of cryptocurrency investment holding firm Primitive Ventures Dovey Wan suggested that fake news circulating in China may be responsible for yesterday’s bitcoin sv (BSV) price surge. Wan posted about the fake news in a tweet on May 29.,"According to Wan, a screenshot circulating on Chinese social media showed a fake article about self-proclaimed bitcoin creator Craig Wright having transferred 50,000 bitcoin (BTC) from the biggest bitcoin wallet in existence to cryptocurrency exchange Binance. According to the report, the transfer would be proof that Wright is Satoshi Nakamoto and created bitcoin.The fake report posted by Wan also claims that Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao reacted to the development by promising to re-list BSV and publicly apologize. As Cointelegraph reported in April, Binance had previously delisted the altcoin in question, apparently because of Wright’s behavior in claiming to be Satoshi.Wan commented stating that, while she does not know how much the alleged fake reports contributed to the price surge, “this fake news snapshot went viral in many Chinese retail groups around the same time.” She also claimed that people who believed the news “got super excited,” and added:“CHINESE RETAIL IS THE BEST HERD EVER”Another Twitter user contradicted this last idea, stating that many retail investors know that some news — even when fake — can lead to a price surge and see it as a trading opportunity. The user concluded: “I disagree that Chinese retail is more of a herd than any other geography.”Bitcoin sv is currently the eighth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, worth a little over $3.9 billion in total with growth of over 30% in the 24 hours to press time, according to CoinMarketCap data.As Cointelegraph recently reported, Craig Wright has filed United States copyright registrations for the bitcoin white paper authored by Satoshi Nakamoto.However, an analysis released by Cointelegraph earlier this month notes that the legal validity of Wright’s copyright filings are an object of dispute.The U.S. Copyright Office had responded on May 22 to the response over Wright's new claim by releasing a press statement noting that “as a general rule, when the Copyright Office receives an application for registration, the claimant certifies as to the truth of the statements made in the submitted materials.” The author of the release concluded:“The Copyright Office does not investigate the truth of any statement made.”"

This update is a reflection of a change in our Kraken market data feed handler from using Kraken’s REST API to their new Websocket API,” the BitMEX team said.Subsequent to the unforeseen 18% drop in the bitcoin’s price, researchers in the crypto industry — including Gnosis product developer Eric Conner — said that the incident could hurt the probability of an exchange-traded fund (ETF) gaining approval by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the near term.A whale crashes the entire crypto market 20% in 5 minutes with a single sell order on the books and people actually think an ETF is coming? 🤣Conner added that, “For reference someone put a 5,000 BTC sell on BitMEX, which BitMEX uses for 50% of its feed and it appears to have tripped some algorithms which made a cascade on BitMEX.”He also added that every rejection of an ETF proposal included the concerns of the SEC regarding market manipulation on unregulated exchanges:“Every single ETF rejection has cited market manipulation on unregulated exchanges as the #1 reason for rejection.”The SEC’s rejection of a bitcoin ETF in July 2018 that was filed by the Winklevoss twins, for instance, explicitly stated that the ETF did not meet the SEC’s requirements concerning the prevention of fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices.Citing the ETF proposal’s reliance on a crypto asset exchange and the lack of regulations in overseas markets, the SEC said:“Although the Commission is disapproving this proposed rule change, the Commission emphasizes that its disapproval does not rest on an evaluation of whether bitcoin, or blockchain technology more generally, has utility or value as an innovation or an investment. Rather, the Commission is disapproving this proposed rule change because, as discussed in detail below, BZX has not met its burden under the Exchange Act and the Commission’s Rules of Practice to demonstrate that its proposal is consistent with the requirements of the Exchange Act Section 6(b)(5), in particular the requirement that its rules be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices.”The SEC, however, emphasized that the disapproval of the ETF proposal was not an evaluation of bitcoin or blockchain technology, clarifying that the rejection explicitly concerns the ETF filing.Other ETF rejections by the SEC, including the disapproval of nine ETFs by the SEC in August 2018 similarly cited the relatively small size of the bitcoin futures market and the spot exchange market, which could leave the ETF vulnerable to manipulation. The SEC ruling published on Aug. 22 read:“And where the Commission has considered a proposed ETP based on futures that had only recently begun trading,38 the Commission specifically addressed whether the futures on which the ETP was based — which were futures on an index of well-established commodity futures — were illiquid or susceptible to manipulation.”Speaking to Cointelegraph in an exclusive interview, Gabor Gurbacs, the director of digital asset strategy at VanEck, an investment management firm based in New York with $47 billion in assets under management, said that the volatility of bitcoin will likely have no effect on the prospect of an ETF.Gurbacs said that millions of U.S. citizens trade and hold bitcoin on an exchange, and a strictly regulated ETF would offer more protection to retail investors.“The current rise and decline in Bitcoin price have no barring on the prospects of an ETF. Millions of Americans hold Bitcoin on an exchange, in OTC products and other forms. Bitcoin is already mainstream. An ETF would add extra customer protections and liquidity as highlighted earlier.”On May 2, Gurbacs said that a bitcoin ETF brings better protection measures for investors than existing investment vehicles, which would allow investors to commit to the crypto market in a safer and more secure environment:“ETFs offer: daily proof of reserves (NAV), transparent holdings, transparent prices, high liquidity, proper tax documents, and investor protections. Bitcoin and crypto need transparent, liquid and regulated ETFs. Investors deserve fair and orderly markets and better protections.”He further added that in recent months, well-regulated over-the-counter (OTC) platforms and trading platforms have emerged to serve accredited investors and institutions, which can provide accurate market data.The New York Stock Exchange’s parent company, the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) is preparing to debut Bakkt in July with a test operation, and Fidelity — the fourth-largest asset manager in the global market — is set to launch a bitcoin custodial service in the near term through Fidelity Digital Assets.“What’s the benefit of leaving millions of people in/on unprotected and substandard vehicles and platforms? The free market should decide their preference. Right now everyone is pushed toward lesser alternatives/product,” Gurbacs said, adding that “there are a good number of highly regulated Authorized Participants(APs), OTC platforms, broker-dealers and trading platforms that are appropriate.”On CNBC’s ETF Edge, ETF.com Managing Director Dave Nadig said that it is quite clear the SEC is in a phase wherein it is focusing on gathering as much information as possible about ETF proposals surrounding bitcoin and potentially other crypto assets.“Well certainly everybody who has filed an ETF has put hundreds of pages of documents back to the SEC trying to close some of these gaps. But, based on the comments we've seen last week around one of these filings, it is clear to the SEC is information gathering mode.”As such, considering the tendency of the SEC to be cautious about the approval of new ETFs and investment vehicles, former Kobre & Kim LLP litigator and U.S.-based attorney Jake Chervinsky said he does not expect the highly anticipated bitcoin ETF proposal of VanEck to be approved. That would mean ETF proposals that are expected by the public to have the best chances of being approved are likely to be rejected.“First, I'd be shocked if the SEC approved the first ever bitcoin ETF after six years of denials without taking all the time allowed by law. Moving slowly makes the SEC appear thoughtful & thorough. VanEck's final deadline is October 18. An early decision likely means denial.“Second, market conditions don't support early approval. Bitcoin has been very volatile recently & investigations related to fraud & manipulation have ramped up (like NYAG & Bitfinex). The SEC has no reason or incentive to come out in favor of bitcoin in this environment.”On April 25, the Office of the New York Attorney General (NYAG) filed a lawsuit against iFinex, the parent company of Bitfinex and Tether, for allegedly misusing $900 million of Tether’s cash reserves.The NYAG alleged Bitfinex had lost $850 million in a dealing with Crypto Capital Corp., a “bank” based in Panama that had processed transactions for crypto exchanges in the past, and covertly received a loan worth $900 million from Tether without alerting investors.Given the ongoing legal dispute between iFinex and the NYAG, Chervinsky suggested that the SEC does not have an incentive to essentially go out of its way to support the crypto industry with an early decision to approve an ETF proposal, which the SEC does not typically do.Overall, as ETF expert Nadig said, things are seemingly heading in the right direction for bitcoin investors.“I think things are pointing towards a positive resolution for bitcoin bulls but I don't think it is imminent,"" Nadig said. And when asked whether he thought something would eventually happen, he said, ""I do.""While there exists a possibility that the SEC will continue to delay ETF proposals for years until the commission feels comfortable approving an investment vehicle, experts generally foresee an ETF being introduced to the U.S. market in the long term.If the rate in which the infrastructure surrounding the crypto market, particularly the institutional side, continues to increase in the short to medium term, with both companies within the crypto market and in the traditional finance sector vamping up efforts to build better custodial solutions, it could contribute to the approval of the first bitcoin ETF.The launch of Bakkt, an ICE-backed bitcoin futures market, and other strictly regulated platforms may also raise the confidence of the commission in the structure of the crypto market, as that would decrease the probability of market manipulation.At its peak in May, the CME bitcoin futures market recorded a daily volume of over $1 billion, which is four times larger than the daily spot volume of bitcoin in early March.2/ First, key takeaways:A. 95% of reported BTC spot volume is fakeB. Likely motive is listing fees (can be $1-3M)C. Real daily spot volume is ~$270MD. 10 exchanges make up almost all real tradingE. Most of the 10 are regulatedF. Spreads are <0.10%. Arb is super efficientFor regulators, the increase in the market share of regulated players like futures markets and strictly compliant exchanges — such as Gemini, Coinbase and Kraken — would create a more favorable market to regulate and to introduce to the broader mainstream investor base."

Their analysis was reported by Bloomberg on May 20.,"The strategists — who reportedly include JPMorgan global market strategist Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou —  judge that the top coin has recently been trading in a way that mirrors its late 2017 rally, which preceded a protracted price slump.To ascertain the coin’s intrinsic value, the strategists reportedly analyzed bitcoin as a commodity and calculated its cost of production based on parameters such as estimated computational power, electricity costs and hardware energy efficiency, Bloomberg notes. They reportedly stated:“Over the past few days, the actual price has moved sharply over marginal cost. This divergence between actual and intrinsic values carries some echoes of the spike higher in late 2017, and at the time this divergence was resolved mostly by a reduction in actual prices.”Bitcoin — which has seen a renewed lease of life since April — has traded as high as almost $8,300 within the last week — having traded sideways below $5,000 throughout February and March. In mid-December 2018, the top coin had traded below the $3,300 mark — with its current price point thus representing a roughly 150% gain over its bear market lows.Bitcoin’s 3-month chart, Feb. 20 — May 20 2019.

Vays made his comments in an interview with Cointelegraph on June 10.,"Vays, a former financial analyst at United States’ banking giant JPMorgan, revealed that he does not trust the recent rally in the crypto markets, claiming that he has not observed “too much external money coming into the space.”The blockchain consultant argued that the recent reverse of a long-lasting bear market was supported by internal capital, stating that there is evidence of enough accumulation by those who preferred to hold their crypto instead of selling it out. According to Vays, if that internal capital “gets scared again,” crypto prices would drop as fast as they rose.While claiming that he would rather be safe than sorry in terms of investing in crypto, Vays still argued that “everyone should have some bitcoin.”In the interview, Vays has also commented on his March $250,000 bet on Twitter that bitcoin (BTC) will fall below the $2,000 price point before the 2024 bitcoin halving.Occurring every 210,000 blocks, the bitcoin halving is a process of dividing the number of generated rewards per block in order to maintain the total supply of the biggest cryptocurrency, which is capped at 21 million. This process is expected to end between March and June 2024 at block 840,000.In regards to his bet, Vays said in the interview that it has become unlikely that bitcoin can dip below $2,000 “at this point,” although he added that it is still possible.Meanwhile, bitcoin has been seeing a major bullish move since April 2019, when its price surged from around $4,000 to almost $9,000 in end of May.

So, is the long-awaited mainstream adoption finally coming to the crypto market?Starbucks’ relationship with crypto could be traced back to January 2018, when its executive chairman and former CEO Howard Schultz discussed the subject during the company’s Q1 2018 earnings call.Schultz appeared skeptical about bitcoin at the time, saying that it won’t be “a currency today or in the future.” However, the chairman suggested that some other cryptocurrencies might succeed instead:“I’m bringing this up because as we think about the future of our company and the future of consumer behavior, I personally believe that there is going to be a one or a few legitimate trusted digital currencies off of the blockchain technology.”Those cryptocurrencies, Schultz added, would have to be legitimized by a brick-and-mortar environment.In an interview with Fox Business that aired in March 2018, Schultz continued to discuss cryptocurrencies and their underlying technology. “I think blockchain technology is probably the rails in which an integrated app at Starbucks will be sitting on top of,” the executive chairman declared.In August 2018, the Seattle-headquartered coffee giant revealed itself as one of Bakkt’s key partners, alongside Microsoft and consultancy Boston Consulting Group. Bakkt is a digital assets platform created by Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), which is expected to launch later this year.Notably, according to the original press release, Starbucks would not only be working with Bakkt to create its platform, but it would also be using it to accept crypto payments in its coffeehouses.“As the flagship retailer, Starbucks will play a pivotal role in developing practical, trusted and regulated applications for consumers to convert their digital assets into US dollars for use at Starbucks,” said Maria Smith, vice president of partnerships and payments at Starbucks.The news provoked bullish headlines akin to CNBC’s “New Starbucks partnership with Microsoft allows customers to pay for Frappuccinos with bitcoin.” However, the coffee retailer was quick to set the record straight. A Starbucks spokesperson told Vice on the same day the press release was published:“It is important to clarify that we are not accepting digital assets at Starbucks. Rather the exchange will convert digital assets like Bitcoin into US dollars, which can be used at Starbucks. At the current time, we are announcing the launch of trading and conversion of Bitcoin. However, we will continue to talk with customers and regulators as the space evolves.”“Customers will not be able to pay for Frappuccinos with bitcoin,” the spokesperson specifically stressed.In March, new details about Starbucks’ partnership with Bakkt surfaced, confirming its intention to accept BTC-based payments once an equity deal between the two is struck.Thus, according to The Block’s report citing anonymous sources, Starbucks will install Bakkt’s payment software in its branches, which will allow customers to pay with digital assets. Such payments will be instantly converted to fiat, however, so that the coffee giant does not have to deal with crypto, supposedly to simplify accounting. The option will be available exclusively for U.S. customers first, the article suggests.That’s “no different” than other BTC merchant programs out there and hence is not a major case of retail adoption, says Michael Dowling, CEO and founder of FairX, a financial services company involved with banking and digital assets, and former chief technology officer at IBM’s blockchain arm. He told Cointelegraph:“No one wants to hold BTC because of its USD volatility, but they love how ‘easy’ it is to receive value on BTC as long as it converts immediately to USD.”Dowling suggested that it could be an attempt for Starbucks and Bakkt to bypass Visa and MasterCard’s interchange fees through the initiative, which can be helpful to merchants, but nonetheless should come with its own shortcomings:“As a merchant, you're just betting the exchange rate will be neutral or in your favor when it comes time to redeem. Oh yeah, and hopefully the redemption agent will always be able to provide USD liquidity.”Eyal Shani, a blockchain researcher at Aykesubir, is also too skeptical to consider the initiative as a case of mainstream adoption, but admits that it could pave the way for further cases.“Accepting bitcoin and immediately transferring it to fiat is simply enjoying the rate and exchange fees on Starbucks’ side,” he told Cointelegraph. “They can accept any currency together with the right fee to process it later. With that being said, any new real use case of bitcoin could serve as another step for larger adoption later down the road, if that happens.”Charlie Smith, an analyst at asset management firm Blockforce Capital, however, thinks that Starbucks’ expected arrival into the field of BTC payments is a largely positive thing for the crypto market as it is. “While some may try to downplay this news because Starbucks will be instantly converting bitcoin payments into fiat currency, we do not believe it diminishes the significance of this news at all,” he wrote to Cointelegraph in an email, adding:“We believe that Starbucks’ reported adoption of BTC as an accepted form of retail payment is a clear case of retail adoption. The fact that customers will be able to pay using bitcoin not only helps increase the overall usability of the currency but should also increase awareness and understanding of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general, given Starbucks’ market share. Additionally, if a retail corporation on the scale of Starbucks has determined that it is in their best interest to accept bitcoin as a form of payment, it is a clear signal that there is a significant consumer population ready to use cryptocurrency as a form of payment on a day-to-day basis.”As for the immediate conversion of BTC, Smith said it should be similar to how a U.S. company converts payments made in euros into U.S. dollars: “There is a big difference between retail adoption of bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies and those same corporations being able or willing to deal with the exchange rate risks inherent in any multinational organization. Starbucks instantly converting bitcoin payments into fiat currency does not impact the retail use case for bitcoin any more so than a US company converting payments made in Euros into USD impacts the retail use case for Euros.”The analyst summarized:“Starbucks adoption is a leap forward for cryptocurrencies allowing people to utilize their bitcoin for more than just an investment, which should hopefully lead to further adoption.''This week, tech news publication GeekWire reported that Starbucks will implement tech giant Microsoft’s recently announced Azure Blockchain Service to track coffee production.First announced in 2018, the initiative is called “bean to cup.” Initially, Starbucks mentioned that it was considering using a “traceability technology” for its coffee-tracking system, without specifying that it necessarily would be a blockchain.  Now, more details have been unveiled. The Azure-powered blockchain system will purportedly allow customers to track the production of their coffee and allegedly provide coffee farmers from Rwanda, Colombia and Costa Rica with more financial independence.Additionally, Starbucks noted that it would make the pilot program open source to disseminate their findings. Other projects announced in collaboration with Microsoft include predictive drive-thru ordering and connecting Internet-of-Things (IoT)-enabled equipment at different cafe locations.Microsoft’s Azure Blockchain Service was announced earlier in May. It is a blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS) platform that allows users to build blockchain applications on a preconfigured network. It currently supports Quorum, the Ethereum-based platform of JPMorgan Chase. The new Microsoft BaaS aims to streamline the use of consortium blockchain networks, from creation to modification.Explaining why Starbucks could pick the Microsoft blockchain solution over other ones, Shani suggested that it could be a move to strengthen the partnership:“Although no relevant information was published, we can safely assume that the choice of Microsoft’s blockchain services over other options were mainly affected by the current partnerships the firms hold rather than the technical differences of blockchain on Azure vs blockchain managed services on AWS, at this level of maturity of those services.”Indeed, the two companies seem to have a close relationship. Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson is a former Microsoft executive who ran the worldwide sales and the Windows divisions before joining the coffeehouse chain in 2015.Smith, on the other hand, argues that Microsoft's product is simply better for Starbucks than other options on the market. “Azure provides the ability to develop and implement blockchain technology into existing infrastructure in a faster and less resource intensive manner,” comparing to Quorum or other existing blockchain protocols, he told Cointelegraph.“This allows Starbucks to focus on its own processes while outsourcing the responsibilities that may be best handled by a blockchain-savvy third party.”Dowling of FairX suggested that Microsoft’s blockchain platform could seem more reputable to Starbucks than Quorum due to its roots:“In enterprise IT, there's an old saying ‘no one gets fired for buying IBM.’ Basically, Quorum is written and maintained by JPM, which is a bank and not a SW dev shop. So, if I'm an enterprise customer, I'm going to feel much more comfortable with a Microsoft branded version – along with their support structure – over the JPM offering, even though they might be the same piece of software. JPM knows that, and that's why they partnered with Microsoft. That's also the reason R3 and IBM did the same with Corda and Fabric.”However, Dowling is not sure why Starbucks would need a blockchain in the first place. He suggested that it could represent a potentially efficient way to track which farmer is sourcing the best beans as ""voted"" by customers, but could not think of any other real case use that could be achieved with blockchain technology specifically:“To be honest, I find the entire program, as explained in the press, very confusing and I'm not sure what problem they are trying to solve. [...] Why does it need to be decentralized?  Why does this program — of people voting for beans, I think — require the application of public/private keys and a distributed database?”Indeed, accomplishing this goal could be done without using blockchain, agrees Smith of Blockforce Capital, “but incorporating an enterprise blockchain solution is more efficient than alternatives.” He went on:“With this initiative, Starbucks is looking to greatly bolster the transparency of its supply chain. [...] The proposed solution can be compared to how other blockchain networks, such as the bitcoin network, validate a large number of transactions without a centralized authority. The underlying technology is similar, its application is just different.”There are other major cases of corporations successfully incorporating blockchain, the analyst adds, arguing that the technology should be the right fit for the “fair trade” concept that is popular within the coffee industry in particular:“The IBM Food Trust program works with Walmart and other major food producers to track food production in order to help stem food-borne illnesses. Starbucks is tackling a similar problem but for a different reason. Whereas food safety isn’t the root cause, Starbucks wants to provide customers the opportunity to track where the coffee they consume is being produced. Any person that is even a casual coffee consumer has heard the term ‘fair trade’ used quite frequently. The concept of fair trade has gained significant attention over the past several years in a number of industries, with coffee being one of, if not the largest industry to focus on fair trade. Through the ‘bean-to-cup’ initiative’s use of blockchain, customers will be able to personally verify where their coffee is coming from and pinpoint specific producers that are producing coffee sustainably and fairly, as well as those that are creating exceptional coffee. A customer drinking Starbucks today has little to no idea who is producing the coffee they are consuming, and can only rely on a sticker to ‘verify’ that coffee is fair trade. In essence, Starbucks is looking for a way to provide greater accountability and that can be accomplished with an enterprise blockchain solution.”Similarly, Shani believes that the “bean-to-cup” initiative is part of the general “food trust” trend empowered by blockchain:“The use of blockchain in the food supply chain is a very interesting one for several reasons. If you’re a building constructor, you’re very likely to buy your hammers all at one place. Firms like Starbucks source their coffee beans from hundreds of thousands of small farmers to meet demand. Some of those farmers won’t even be registered business in their home countries. It is impossible to maintain trust when dealing with such large scale long-branched supply chain. Instead of making one entity to hold all the data and attest it’s correct, a smarter idea would be to create a collaborative blockchain based database where every party is liable to their part.”However, the blockchain researcher added that even a centralized database could create new opportunities within the coffee industry, considering “the state in which the legacy systems are today.” Shani also stressed that neither the exact architecture of the solution nor the trust model have been disclosed by Startbucks at this point.The potential financial opportunities for coffee farmers mentioned in the press release and the GeekTimes report are also somewhat unclear.“The only thing I can think of here is there's a payment rail component that reduces the cost of cross-border transactions,” Dowling told Cointelegraph. “Though they make no mention of that. Or there's some kind of ‘bean-coin’ the farmers get, and they redeem that for fiat? If that's the case, why blockchain?”Given that the main benefit of the “bean-to-cup” initiative is that it can provide farmers increased transparency and a large amount of new data, Smith suggested, it could allow them to build their unique brands “outside the overall Starbucks name.” He continued:“Currently, when you buy coffee from Starbucks the only information available is the type of coffee and the country where it was grown. By utilizing blockchain, Starbucks will be able to provide its customers with endless amounts of new information, such as when the coffee was harvested, when it was shipped, what farm it came from, and potentially even the farming techniques used as that farm.“This will provide customers with greater power to support certain farmers, whether because of sustainability or simply because that farmer makes the best tasting coffee. This, in turn, should allow the more than 380,000 farms to differentiate themselves and build a unique brand outside of the overall Starbucks name. From the farmers’ standpoint, this new service should provide valuable data on consumer preferences and taste profiles, which will allow farmers to form data-driven conclusions and help them make more profitable decisions.”Cointelegraph has reached out to Starbucks to clarify why it would need a blockchain and how exactly it could benefit the coffee farmers, among other things, but has not heard back as of press time."

According to the firm, the “deep cold storage wallet” is unhackable and uses “offline generated, non-deterministic TRNGs (True Random Numbers Generated).”In a press release from Regal Assets, regional director of Franck Muller, Erol Baliyan, commented on the leading cryptocurrency, saying “Bitcoin is the millennial gold.” He added:“Bitcoin is the [...] perfect marriage between innovation and personal choice.”The Encrypto can be bought with BTC or traditional payment methods. The company is reportedly considering the production of functionally similar timepieces that support other top-five cryptocurrencies, such as ether (ETH) and Ripple’s XRP.As reported May 24, another Swiss luxury watch and clock manufacturer, Vacheron Constantin, will start using blockchain technology to track its timepieces.Last year, Cointelegraph reported that Hublot — yet another Swiss luxury watch maker — released a limited edition model commemorating the 10th anniversary of the bitcoin white paper. The watch, Big Bang Blockchain, could only be bought with BTC and only 210 copies were made, a reference to Bitcoin’s fixed supply cap of 210 thousand (21 million) coins."

Bloomberg also claims that similar patterns in the past have heralded multi-week long downturns.Bitcoin’s GTI Global Strength Indicator. Source: BloombergAccording to McGlone, recent market growth occurred because of long-term price compression and low volatility, which caused the price to be “released from the cage.” McGlone stated that he expects a similar downturn period to follow the recent growth:“Now it’s a question of duration and I suspect when you have such a massive bubble, you’ll always have an overhang of people who need to sell.”The article also quotes David Tawil, president of crypto hedge fund ProChain Capital, who reportedly expects the market to continue its downward trend. While he admits that “it’s nice to see a positive move as opposed to a negative move,” he notes that it is not comforting:“Certainly, an investor would much rather see a gradual rise with constant floors in terms of downside being established, as opposed to a very, very quick run-up. It could easily be easy come, easy go.”McGlone’s and Tawil’s analysis appear to contrast with that of Fundstrat Global Advisors co-founder Thomas Lee. As Cointelegraph reported yesterday, according to Lee, Bitcoin is back in a bullish trend. Lee pointed out that BTC has now broken over its 200-day-moving-average.Additionally, trade and author Peter Brandt seemingly disagreed with McGlone, having tweeted on April 5 that he wouldn't be surprised if Bitcoin was to enter another parabolic phase.Earlier this week, leading United States derivative market CME Group pointed out that its Bitcoin futures reported record trading volumes on April 4."

network independently without having to trust third-party wallet services.","Jun 25, 2019","The Raspberry Pi Foundation released a new, more powerful model of its miniscule single-board computer on June 24, which costs $35 a pop and has the capacity to run full nodes cheaply on the bitcoin (BTC) network.","Earlier versions of the Raspberry Pi have been popular with bitcoin enthusiasts and decentralization advocates as it offers low-cost and thus low-barrier entry to those interested in running their own full nodes on the network.Doing so allows users to verify their own transactions over the bitcoin network independently without having to trust third-party wallet services. Unlike miners, who are rewarded with BTC for validating transactions, full nodes do not get compensation for their contribution to the network — which they make in the form of hosting and transmitting updated copies of the blockchain (or distributed transaction ledger).The new Pi is thus apparently poised to make the process and costs of running a full node more efficient for all network participants — whether they be miners, enterprises, or privacy-conscious individuals. As of press time, almost 23% of bitcoin nodes globally are run from the United States, followed by Germany at circa 19%. One of the industry’s popular pre-synced node products, Casa Node, has relied on an inbuilt Raspberry Pi — though earlier iterations of the model have frustrated some users due to its reported slowness.The new model — the computer’s 4th version — purportedly represents a significant upgrade on earlier versions. At its most expensive — with 4GB RAM — it costs $55 (excluding tax).The Raspberry Pi Foundation says the latest model supports for an extra 500mA of current — enabled by the switch from USB micro-B to USB-C — thereby ensuring the computer has a full 1.2A for downstream USB devices. It also comes with a new operating system, which the Foundation claims come with a host of back-end technical improvements, Gigabit Ethernet speed, a modernized interface, plus support for updated applications such as Chromium 74 web browser. Notably, in the years since Pi’s first release in 2012, other options of low-barrier entry hardware have emerged — including HTC’s Exodus 1S smartphone, which has bitcoin full node capability and was released this May.Also in May, Cointelegraph reported on data released by bitcoin core developer Luke Dashjr apparently indicating that over half of the full nodes in the bitcoin network were still running client software vulnerable to an inflation bug discovered back in September 2018."

First a 3 block re-organisation, followed by a 6 block re-organisation.” BitMEX provided a diagram in the post:Bitcoin SV block reorganization. Source: BitMEXBlockchain re-organization is a situation when two miners discover a block simultaneously in a blockchain which causes a temporary forking in the network, with the situation resolved when a miner finds the next block as their chain has the more work out of two forks. The block which caused the fork becomes “orphaned,” and is changed with the block from the fork with more blocks. Block re-organization occurs when the network is too slow to reproduce blocks efficiently.In the comments to the tweet, BitMEX explains that it detected two valid competing chains, with a split occurred at block 578,639. BitMEX’s node reportedly followed the chain on the left until block 578,642, which further leapt to the right. In about an hour the chain reportedly jumped back to the left side. BitMEX notes that no double spending took place.When asked what it could possibly mean, BitMEX outlined several variants, saying that the Bitcoin Cash SV network is not reliable for payments, the block size limit is too large and network latency is too high.Most recently, BSV has had difficulties on cryptocurrency exchanges, with some announcing they would delist the coin. Major crypto exchange Binance stated that as of April 22, it will delist and cease trading on all trading pairs for BSV. Binance explained that it only delists a coin after another in-depth review, noting “[w]e believe this best protects all of our users.”A few days later, United States-based crypto exchange Kraken also decided to delist BSV. In an official press release, Kraken said that BSV had “engaged in behavior completely antithetical to everything we at Kraken and the wider crypto community stands for.”"

Antonopoulos added:“And then — and only then — Koreans will need cryptocurrency.”Antonopoulos highlighted the fact that, in contrast to the utopian visions of the future, current cryptocurrency usage remains either a niche hobby or a product of desperation with the banks.At present, only a tiny fraction of consumers use Bitcoin: this is logical, he says, given the overall difficulty of crypto and the technical knowledge required to store and transact with it successfully.Cryptocurrencies and open blockchains “are only being adopted in the places where the pain of the current financial system is so extreme that people are forced to use something that is difficult to understand, difficult to secure, with very poorly designed applications and with very difficult wording,” he said.Nonetheless, with advances ongoing, Bitcoin is at least set to overtake extant payment systems such as Visa and MasterCard, in his opinion.“We are poised to achieve ten thousand times their capacity,” Antonopoulos added, echoing findings from a report into Bitcoin as the future of payments released earlier this week.As Cointelegraph reported, scaling solutions for Bitcoin should help take it to the status of preeminent world payment system in as little as ten years, research from software company DataLight forecast."

This, Diar notes, is similar to the figure from June 2018, when the price of bitcoin circled $7,000.Far from reflecting increased real-world usage, however, the driving cause of the uptick remains trading and speculative moves.“On-chain value of both Bitcoins and US Dollar value continue to follow price trends indicating the king of cryptocurrencies has yet to find any footing outside of speculative trading almost two years on from entering the financial challenger hall of fame,” researchers warned.More bearish was data showing quarterly volume, which has also declined steadily since 2017.The first quarter of 2019 was no exception, with a 35% drop in volume versus the final segment of last year, which included bitcoin’s price drop from $6,500 to a low of $3,100.“2Q19 has kicked off on a higher note compared to previous years,” Diar added.The mood among longtime market analysts nonetheless remains buoyant. After a report from digital assets fund Adamant Capital declared that the crypto bear market was winding down, Fundstrat Global Advisors co-founder Tom Lee continued the bullish sentiment on social media on Tuesday.His reason for optimism revolved around the lack of long-term market suppression in the wake of legal problems at cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex and its sister company, stablecoin tether (USDT)."

The developers also warn that the users should not put more funds into the app than they are willing to lose.Furthermore, while the release supports macOS, Windows and Linux, the post also specifies that it is an important stepping stone in the development of a mobile version. The team notes:“We’re working as quickly as we can to get our mainnet iOS and Android apps out soon.”Lightning Labs also claims to be committed to privacy, security and self-determination, the principles that it believes bitcoin was built on. The announcement explains that, to deliver a system in line with those principles, the company needs to release an easy to use non-custodial client solution. The post notes:“Scaling Bitcoin and Lightning to everyone means not requiring people to follow complex setup processes or hand over control of their funds to trusted counterparties.”The newly-released solution uses the Neutrino bitcoin light client, which reportedly allows for the use of the LN scalability solution without downloading the entire blockchain first or handing over control over funds. Per the announcement, Neutrino only needs to download and verify tens of megabytes, which can be done in minutes, enabling practical use on smartphones and other low-power devices.As Cointelegraph reported yesterday, crypto payments processing startup Moon is launching a web browser extension that allows e-commerce shoppers to use their LN bitcoin wallets for purchases on sites like Amazon.Also, at the beginning of the current month, news broke that the United States-based startup Sparkswap has completed a successful seed funding round to create a decentralized exchange based on the bitcoin LN."

deals — what does that mean for the future of cash trades?","Jun 6, 2019","On June 1, Finnish peer-to-peer (p2p) bitcoin (BTC) trading platform LocalBitcoins quietly removed in-person cash trading from its service. Three days later, the company publicly confirmed the ban on Twitter. As per the accompanying statement, LocalBitcoins had to renounce local cash trading to “adapt to the current regulatory environment.”","The removal of the option has angered users, who seemingly began looking for decentralized platforms with more room for anonymity. However, as the Wild West-like unregulated days of crypto might be coming to an end, the more p2p services might have to apply Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) efforts in order to stay compliant with the watchdogs.Founded in June 2012, LocalBitcoins is one of the crypto industry’s longest-standing veterans. It is headquartered in Helsinki, Finland.Unlike Coinbase — which was established the same month — and other conventional cryptocurrency exchanges, LocalBitcoins positions itself as a decentralized service that matches people who are willing to trade bitcoin. In that sense, it is easy to compare LocalBitcoins with similar p2p services like Craigslist or eBay.Imagine a marketplace where people post their offers to buy or sell bitcoin on a bulletin board, specifying the exchange rate and location (among other things). Interested users reply to those advertisements, choosing to either meet in person and exchange bitcoin for cash, or trade remotely using online banking.That is what LocalBitcoins was until June 1, when the cash option was suddenly removed from the platform. Now, users can only trade via online payment options, or deposit their cash directly to the seller's bank account.Predominantly, people choose to meet up to buy and sell cryptocurrencies with cash for anonymity reasons, since no personal information was required in the process.It is also irreversible, Michael Foster said, who co-founded a similarly-named p2p platform, LocalEthereum, which caters to Ethereum (ETH) users. He explained to Cointelegraph:“There is a zero possibility of chargeback fraud, which is the hardest scam to avoid when trading P2P. Chargeback fraud is when, for example, somebody sends you money via PayPal, only to reverse the transaction after receiving the goods.”So, this is how an in-person, cash-based crypto transaction normally happens: After being matched online, both parties arrange a meetup at a public place with Wi-Fi. Then, after receiving an envelope of cash along with a wallet address, the selling party transfers the cryptocurrency on-the-spot, using their laptop or mobile phone.“It's best to meet in daylight, in an area with lots of people and cameras. For extra security, bring a friend, or make the exchange inside an airport or a bank,” Foster added.While it is difficult to call this option a safe one in the conventional sense, financially wise, it is the most secure scenario, a representative of p2p exchange Bisq told Cointelegraph:“I see the choice as a trade-off between physical safety, financial safety, privacy, and convenience. If it's financial safety someone prefers, then cash is king. Nothing beats obtaining cold hard cash and depositing it in your bank yourself. There's zero chargeback risk. But that financial safety comes at a risk to physical safety. [...] Non-cash payment methods get around this physical safety risk, but require a person to reveal information to a counterparty that they might not want to reveal. And these methods are usually a lot more convenient too. Which one is better or ‘safer’ is a personal judgment.”LocalBitcoins started applying KYC measures in April 2018, when a trader proved on Reddit that a personal ID was now required to buy and sell bitcoin for some trade volumes.“Error! Your trade volume has been significant in the past 12 months. Please verify your ID to continue trading,” the screenshotted message displayed.Expectedly, the reduction of anonymity on one of the oldest marketplaces in the industry angered decentralization pundits. “RIP localbitcoins. Hi, another centralized exchange,” read one of the top comments on the thread.The peer-to-peer exchange kept silent until May 9, 2018, when it finally announced that updated terms of service were coming into effect closer to the end of the month. Notably, the changes were performed in accordance with General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a European Union decree on data protection and privacy.Thus, starting from May 25, 2018, LocalBitcoin users were asked to verify their ID on several occasions, including “trading over certain volume limits,” as well as fraud investigations, among others. They also had to be older than 16 and register only one account per person.Almost a year later, on March 25, 2019, LocalBitcoins announced it will soon become supervised by the Financial Supervisory Authority (FSA) of Finland, soon after the Finnish parliament approved new legislation that will provide a legal status for cryptocurrency assets.Around the same time, LocalBitcoins banned users living in Iran, presumably due to sanctions previously imposed by the United States.On June 1, users started reporting that cash-in trading was removed from LocalBitcoins. Again, crypto traders preferring the meetup option were displeased. “It’s time to no longer recommend LocalBitcoins, EVER,” the top response to the original Reddit report reads, while the following comment contains a list of alternative platforms.Similarly to last year, LocalBitcoins did not issue a public announcement for several days. On June 4, a statement was finally released explaining that the removal was dictated by the local regulatory framework:Four different p2p platforms approached by Cointelegraph confirmed that they have seen an increase in local cash trades ads on their platforms since LocalBitcoins removed the option.However, in-person meetings accounted for 0.5-2% of all trades on three of those platforms, based on their answers, with one exchange reporting 16%, meaning that the general demand is quite low. A representative of the p2p bitcoin exchange Hodl Hodl told Cointelegraph:“It [local cash trading] is not really popular, but we've seen an influx of traders who used to trade on Localbitcoins coming to our Telegram group and actively discussing various options on how to trade cash and suggesting improvements, which we think is great, helps us improve the workflow and we're expecting to see more cash trades soon.”Ray Youssef, CEO and co-founder of Paxful, another popular platform for p2p exchanges, told Cointelegraph that there was an increase in cash transactions “throughout the month of May.”A representative for Bisq also said that it has seen more offers in the USD market lately. “Less than 2% of the trades on Bisq so far in June have been cash trades,” the spokesperson specified.LocalEtehreum, in turn, reported “a huge uptick” in face-to-face exchanges since LocalBitcoins removed the option, in an email conversation with Cointelegraph:“Cash exchanges made up 0.6% of LocalEthereum's volume last month. Since the announcement, cash has climbed to 16% of volume — a 26-fold hike. We've never seen this level of activity for cash before.”However, some LocalBitcoins users are not switching over, yet. Now that the “cash in-person” options are not available on the platform, some traders list those offers under the “cash deposit” tab, specifying that they are only looking for face-to-face meetups.A United Kingdom-based trader, who has posted a similar advertisement, told Cointelegraph, “I tried to post again and it didn't work so we tried cash deposit but that's also kind of useless now as people want to use cash deposit service”That trader is now considering moving to other p2p platforms. “What defeats the point of BTC anonymity is transferring funds from your own bank account through a centralized company and then purchasing BTC,” he told Cointelegraph via Telegram.“Not very local anymore,” he said of LocalBitcoins.Another seller based in Thailand, who prefers to stay anonymous, also confirmed to Cointelegraph that he or she was trying to bypass the local cash trades ban by listing their offer under the cash deposit tab:“I have no idea why localbitcoins stopped the cash trades, but if they don't make them come back in the near future, I will use other platforms. I am already looking at alternatives.”Nevertheless, LocalBitcoins might curb those kind of ads in the near future, according to what the spokesperson for LocalBitcoins told Cointelegraph via email:“It is not possible anymore to create local buy/sell ads for cash money, all the existing ads are being removed.”LocalBitcoins declined to comment on how popular cash trading was on their platform prior to the removal. Also, when asked whether any other KYC-related changes should be expected from LocalBitcoins in the light of local or EU regulations, the spokesperson said it “will inform our users as soon as possible,” if something should happen.Now that LocalBitcoins had to abandon the cash in-person trading, its rival p2p platforms are picking up a fraction of its traders. But will they remain pro-anonymity amid the increasing pressure of compliance in the industry? Hodl Hodl representative told Cointelegraph:“As for us, we'd rather shut down and stop operations than subject our users to KYC/AML. There's simply no market for a P2P exchange that does KYC/AML. The only reason LocalBitcoins is still making money is because the majority of their volume is from jurisdictions where the KYC/AML info that users provide is not yet affecting said users.”The Hodl Hodl spokesperson agreed that it is possible that all p2p platforms will be forced to ban cash trading in the future, but argued that, since its exchange is noncustodial and doesn’t hold any bitcoins or fiat money, it might have a better chance of being cleared to operate.LocalEthereum brought up the same argument in its conversation with Cointelegraph, arguing that its platform is noncustodial as well, and hence might be exempt from certain regulations.Youssef of Paxful also told Cointelegraph that its service is determined to keep the cash option:“As the Age of Compliance begins to dawn, many P2P exchanges may need to ban cash transactions as they will not have the compliance resources to handle the anti-money laundering, safety, and regulatory issues, but not at Paxful. We have a top tier legal and compliance team and we are growing our compliance efforts immensely, keeping the door open for the unbanked and underbanked worldwide.”Thus, it is unclear if there will be another crackdown on p2p exchanges, as it largely depends on the jurisdiction in which such services are based. As previous examples from the crypto industry have shown, a company might choose to move to another country when faced with extensive local regulatory difficulties.As for now, the p2p exchanges segment seems puzzled by the sudden crackdown, according to what the Bisq representative told Cointelegraph:“I don't see how buying bitcoin with cash is any different from buying bananas or bullion with cash. Neither person knows the other person, and it doesn't matter.”However, he added, exchanges (even peer-to-peer ones) need to follow the laws of their jurisdictions — and traders should too."
101,https://cointelegraph.com,"Apr 5, 2019",Bitcoin Wash Trading: Sifting Facts From Fears,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-wash-trading-sifting-facts-from-fears,"Some cryptocurrency exchange platforms are inflating their Bitcoin trading 
volumes to earn higher listing fees, but the market's liquidity is still ...","Apr 5, 2019","In mid-March, Bitwise Asset Management issued a damning report on Bitcoin (BTC) trading figures. The San Francisco-based index fund provider declared that up 95 percent of Bitcoin trading volume as seen on CoinMarketCap (CMC) was due to so-called wash trading.","Wash trading is a type of market manipulation where sell and buy orders are simultaneously placed on the same asset to create false and misleading trading activity in the market. Wash trading is illegal in regulated exchange platforms.As part of its Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) application to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Bitwise submitted a proposed rule change that included a report on the Bitcoin trading market. According to the report, 95 percent of the recorded BTC trading volume is due to wash trading by bots.So, where CMC figures would show about $11 billion in daily BTC trading volume, the actual figure less wash trading would be about $470 million. For Bitwise, the problem comes from the fact that CMC and other similar platforms use fake data from obscure cryptocurrency exchange platforms.The revelations from the Bitwise report on wash trading echo the findings of previous reports released by the Blockchain Transparency Institute (BTI) and Tie — a trading analytics platform. As reported by Cointelegraph, data from 97 exchanges show that 87 percent of cryptocurrency exchange volume was potentially false, according to Tie.These revelations caused considerable debate among stakeholders in the industry. Critics of platforms like CMC were quick to point out the flaws in CMC’s metrics. Others also ignited the price manipulation debate and the impact of the overwhelming level of wash trading on BTC price discovery.CMC is a cryptocurrency market data provider and is among the top-500 visited websites in the world. Trading volume figures on a platform as popular as CMC arguably play a major role in shaping market trading. Thus, there is a palpable concern about the effect of such inflated trading volumes on the market in general.The data provided by CMC comes directly from exchanges listed on the websites. Some of these platforms domiciled in loosely regulated spheres are reportedly wont to inflate their trading figures to attain a higher position on the CMC ranking of exchange platforms by 24-hour trading volumes.In an interview with Cointelegraph, Changpeng Zhao (aka CZ), CEO of Binance — one of the largest cryptocurrency exchange platforms in the market — says that CMC isn’t solely to blame. According to Zhao:“It’s not so much CoinMarketCap’s fault. Everyone tries to blame them, but CMC is a very simple reporting mechanism where every exchange reports their own data to it and they just show it.”While CZ appears sympathetic toward CMC, others believe the platform is to blame. Ryan Selkis of Messari, another cryptocurrency market data provider, declared via his Twitter handle that CMC’s data is mostly wrong, and this includes market cap, circulating supply and, of course, trading volumes.Selkis pointed to the supply readings for XLM and XRP as examples of false and misleading data on the CMC platform. For these two cryptocurrencies in particular, the significant treasuries held by institutions with strong affiliations to the tokens help to inflate their market capitalization values, thus earning higher rankings on CMC.This incorrect data paints an exaggerated picture of the global cryptocurrency market that obscures the real size of the market. Given the sheer proportion of wash trading by bots, the effect of such a reality on the fidelity of the market becomes the next logical inquiry.The fear of price manipulation is never far from Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market as a whole. Back in 2018, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) began investigating claims of market manipulation in the market.The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) also initiated a separate investigation into the manipulation of BTC and Ethereum (ETH) via wash trading and spoofing. So, then is the ongoing high volume of wash trading significantly impacting the prices of cryptocurrencies?Commenting on the issue in an email, Joe DiPasquale, CEO of BitBull Capital — a cryptocurrency hedge fund — opined:“If 95% of CMC’s BTC trading volume is fake, as per the report, it means market activity is being manipulated and the current price is not reflecting true market sentiment. However, as more reputable exchanges enter the space, this effect should diminish, since most of the ‘real’ trading is already taking place on well-known exchanges.”Mati Greenspan, a senior market analyst at eToro, made the same conclusion in a recent market analysis article, saying on his blog:“The key here is that all this wash trading that’s been discovered hasn’t actually affected the price of bitcoin itself in any meaningful way. In fact, if we focus only on the real 10 exchanges, we can see that this market is much more robust than previously perceived.”According to Greenspan’s analysis and the Bitwise report, most of the market liquidity comes from 10 exchanges, even though there are hundreds of such platforms. Nine out of these 10 platforms are regulated, and the price of BTC displayed among them is fairly consistent.So, if wash trading isn’t having a significant impact on price, why then is the practice this widespread? The answer probably lies in the attempts by these much smaller platforms to gain a larger share of the trading market.By inflating their figures, they can rise up the CMC rankings. Such a situation gives them the opportunity to attract more users and charge higher listing fees.Some industry commentators have laid down numerous methodologies that could be used to identify fake trading volumes. Cointelegraph spoke with Joshua Frank, co-founder of Tie, who said comparing website viewership and trading volume was one of the easiest ways of identifying suspicious trading volumes.According to Frank, the firm’s research showed a major distinction between those two metrics for “reputable platforms” and lesser known exchanges. Many of the exchanges suspected of wash trading routinely show figures like $400,000 in trading volume per view. Meanwhile, on well-known platforms, the figures are closer to $500-$600.Frank also went on to state that the company decided to make the data available to the public via Google Sheets. The Tie co-founder said more experienced traders can also examine the trading history and order book of exchanges to spot suspicious trading data.Since most exchange platforms are centralized, it is possible for them to inflate their figures by trading the same cryptocurrencies between a pair of bot accounts repeatedly. This gives rise to false high-volume figures that create the appearance of high liquidity.In the wake of revelation from Bitwise, several stakeholders have proposed solutions to the fake trading volume problem. For CMC, the first step would be to improve the way it presents market data to users. In an email to Cointelegraph, the company noted:“In an open ecosystem like the one we are in; we believe that the best policy — one that we follow closely — is to over-provide on data and let users make their own informed choices about what to do with that data.”Already, Messari has taken steps to display extra information that offers up more insight into the reliability of trading volume figures. The platform included a new column on its website called the “Real 10 Volume.”This new metric displays the 24-hour trading volume obtained from the 10 cryptocurrency exchanges found not to be involved in wash trading by the Bitwise report. The platform also announced that it would collaborate with these reputable exchanges to further improve the quality of its market data.Messari’s approach with the “Real 10 Volume” seems to tie in with CMC’s sentiments about over-providing data. It is then left up to the trader to use the different metrics available as gauges for determining what is real and what is fake.Carylyne Chan, the global marketing chief at CMC, made similar remarks in an interview with Bloomberg, saying:“For instance, if an exchange with low traffic has $300M volume and just 5 BTC in its wallet, users will be able to draw their own conclusions without the need for us to make arbitrary judgment calls on what is ’good’ or ’bad.’”For CZ, there is a need for greater transparency in the industry to eliminate such problems. The Binance chief also believes that CMC can use its considerable influence to encourage ethical behavior among listed exchange platforms.Being a top-500 website on the Alexa rankings, most exchange platforms depend on CMC for referral traffic. CZ states that CMC can impose fines and suspend the listing of platforms that engage in unethical practices. Whether that — and more scrutiny — will be enough to curb the practice remains to be seen."

The development was reported by anti-malware software firm Malwarebytes in a blog post on April 29.","Malwarebytes discovered that the number of infected machines in the botnet has amounted to as high as 152,000, with the volume of stolen funds increasing to $4.6 million. The company managed to pinpoint a loader dubbed Trojan.BeamWinHTTP, which is also involved in downloading the previously-detected Electrum DoSMiner.The largest concentration of the bots is reportedly located in the Asia Pacific region, Brazil and Peru, with the botnet that is attacking the Electrum infrastructure constantly growing.In early April, Cointelegraph reported that the ongoing DoS attack on the Electrum network was allegedly launched by a malicious botnet of more than 140,000 machines, aiming to steal users’ BTC by referring them to fake versions of Electrum software.As reported, the attackers implemented their own Electrum servers hosting compromised Electrum versions in order to realize the hack. After users sync their vulnerable Electrum wallet with a malicious server, they are directed to “update” their client with a hacked version, which eventually leads to an immediate loss of funds that were contained in the old versions.Last December, the hack allowed a malicious party steal almost 250 BTC (about $937,000 at the time). Affected users reported trying and failing to log in to their wallets after providing their two-factor authentication code — something Electrum did not in fact request during login. The hackers then emptied the wallet balance.Earlier in April, hardware cryptocurrency wallet manufacturer Ledger detected malware targeting its desktop application. The malware locally replaced the Ledger Live desktop app with a malicious one, infecting only Windows machines. Ledger further noted that the malware cannot compromise users’ computers or digital currency, but only represents a phishing attack in a bid to lure users to enter their 24-words recovery phrases."
103,https://cointelegraph.com,"Jun 6, 2019",Egypt Lays Out Path for a Crypto Future With Draft Law,https://cointelegraph.com/news/egypt-lays-out-path-for-a-crypto-future-with-draft-law,"Bitcoin (BTC) and cryptocurrencies only began to be widely discussed in 
2015, when the startup Yellow launched a bitcoin voucher service.","Jun 6, 2019","In the end of May 2019, the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) announced that it is working on a draft law for crypto-related activities. When introduced, it will oblige financial institutions in the country to obtain licenses in advance for creating, advertising or operating platforms that issue or facilitate trading of cryptocurrencies. Licenses will be issued by the CBE’s board of directors. This marked the first step the Egyptian government made toward the legalization of activities related to cryptocurrencies.","The state’s attitude toward the new sector of the economy, especially the financial structures in Egypt has always been unstable. Bitcoin (BTC) and cryptocurrencies only began to be widely discussed in 2015, when the startup Yellow launched a bitcoin voucher service. In fact, it was the first service in the region of the Middle East and North Africa that allowed Egyptian citizens to buy bitcoin for the national currency through the use of vouchers.According to the creator of the service, David El Achkar, only 10% of Egyptian citizens had bank cards and accounts. So, he saw the prospect for widespread use of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in the country.And he was proven right. Cryptocurrencies quickly became popular among the citizens, partially due to the unstable financial situation in the country. Crypto-enthusiast Ahmed Elmogy claimed that many Egyptians preferred money transfers in bitcoin as a convenient and cost-effective instrument. But even then, he noted that the government of the country was rather sceptical about new technology and digital currencies due to a poor understanding of the essence of this technology.His words were confirmed in July 2017, when the Egyptian government made a tough statement that indicated that cryptocurrencies carried a certain risk, as they could be used by terrorist groups to finance their activities anonymously.Since then, the financial situation in the country continued to deteriorate, and just a month after the announcement, in August 2017, news surfaced that Egypt would be getting its first crypto exchange — i.e., Yellow — which was supposed to start trading in September 2017. The exchange was supposed to be the first service where the Egyptian pound could be exchanged for digital currencies in a bitcoin\pound trading pair, without the use of other currencies like the United States dollar.But in January 2018, a high-ranking official on religious law, Grand Mufti Shawki Allam, called bitcoin trading illegal under Islam’s Sharia law, as bitcoin was not an “acceptable interface of exchange” and therefore unlawful to trade it. The cleric also said that bitcoin was a tool for money laundering and indicated that it was not under the control of any government, and so it could potentially undermine the economy of Egypt.The government employed a strict attitude toward cryptocurrencies until the end of 2018, when, in late winter, the government had to look for ways to cut costs. Then, the representative of the CBE said that the government wanted to introduce a digital version of the Egyptian pound. The bank worked on a feasibility study of such a maneuver.There were claims that Egypt believed that the digital version of its blockchain-based paper currency could help to minimize the government’s expenses on issuing paper money and transactions compared to coins and bank notes, which was the first step toward a cashless society.But further development and research stumbled. The CBE did not introduce and did not issue its cryptocurrency, perhaps because of the low awareness and understanding of blockchain technology or possibly due to real economic problems, because of which a digital national cryptocurrency was not the primary goal.As it turned out, the government did not abandon the idea of a national cryptocurrency and in May 2019, it announced the intention to issue licenses for fintech firms and banks, which in turn would allow them to issue and trade cryptocurrencies, as well as process transactions. The purpose of the future law is to establish state control over the development of new technologies in the financial and banking sectors. The law is expected to become the basis for digital payments in the country.A possible reason for this step by Egyptian authorities is the interest of neighboring countries in the development of blockchain industry. For example, representatives of the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia announced at the beginning of the year a cooperation in order to create a joint cryptocurrency, which will be used as cross-border digital asset between the banks of both countries.Experts from both countries discussed the jointly integrated strategy, including initiatives in such areas as civil aviation, financial literacy for young people and the creation of a digital currency intended for cross-border payments. Earlier, UAE-based payment company UAE Exchange created a blockchain payment system together with Ripple.But the legal status of cryptocurrencies in Egypt is still uncertain — i.e., it is not defined. The CBE has yet to determine its position on digital currencies and their place in the country's economy. But, what is pleasing, however, is that the authorities have moved away from the path of prohibitions that will enable exchanges to conduct their business in the country.At the same time, some on Twitter have questioned whether the prohibition of cryptocurrency trading in Egypt was ever present:Actually - I can't find any evidence of an Egypt Crypto ban. The #libraryofcongress says1. CBE has issued a warning about the danger of crypto2. Various Egyptian religious authorities have 'banned' crypto - but a fatawa isn't a legal documentSo, the licensing of cryptocurrency exchanges is an ambiguous thing. For ordinary users the most important issue is the safety of their funds. Licenses do not contribute to this: Hackers might break into any exchange and do not pay attention to their legal status, just as in the recent attack on a highly compliant exchange, Binance. Having crypto exchanges without any sort of regulation in this day and age would be unthinkable, since such a young industry is full of fraud.Therefore, it seems like the Egyptian authorities have managed to overcome the sharp denial of cryptocurrencies and have recognized the importance of fintech companies in the country.The development of licenses in Egypt also marks a step toward the development of a digital economy, which is widely discussed in most western countries. Surely the confirmation of digital payments, exchanges and transfers requires deep learning and testing. But the Egyptian mood regarding cryptocurrencies has been changing for a while, ever since the CBE reported on developing a digital version of the national currency.The main problem the government wanted to solve was the increasing complication of printing bank notes. The cheaper it is to create money, the less destructive will the inflation be for the country's economy. Besides that, the transfer to a cashless society provides many more tools to maintain the general welfare of the country. The regulation of cryptocurrencies in Egypt isn’t expected until the end of 2019, but the licenses must become sufficient until that time comes.It is clear that there are still a lot of questions and uncertainties about both the new law and the Egyptian government’s approach to cryptocurrencies. But some experts are optimistic about any attempt of the state to welcome the new technology.According to analytical ratings website ICObench, there are currently only three initial coin offerings (ICOs) that are related to Egypt. In comparison, there are nearly 750 ICOs being held in the U.S. The current disparity is vast, but maybe a more favorable stance from the government might encourage new ICOs to emerge.The fact that Egypt has begun to switch its approach may signal that it is ready to accept the progress of crypto, gain new streams of income and even open up a new sector of the economy. Perhaps such a long wait to remove the ban was not accidental. The government was possibly studying how other progressive countries, such as the UAE, successfully issued licenses for cryptocurrencies exchanges, which ensured the security of digital assets. And now, Egypt is also potentially ready to repeat that successful experience while taking minimal risks."

overview of one of the most controversial figures in the crypto ...","Apr 7, 2019","Recently, it was revealed that Craig Steven Wright, one of the most controversial figures in the crypto community, had filed 114 blockchain patents since 2017. He also quit Twitter, where he would often publish his opinions on anonymity (bad), Bitcoin SV (the real Bitcoin) and other cryptocurrencies (also bad).","He is also known for arguing that he is actually Satoshi Nakamoto, the original creator of Bitcoin. Here’s the complete list of things you should know about Wright.He was born in October 1970 in Australia, according to registration papers of one of his many companies. As per a Business Insider article citing his now-edited LinkedIn profile, Wright graduated from Brisbane's Padua Catholic College in 1987. In the early 1990s, he worked as a sauce cook, “having trained in French cuisine,” and spent three years working with a catering company.Wright was reportedly studying at the University of Queensland while working as a chef. He initially attended engineering classes, but switched to computer science in his fourth year.In 1996, as per his earlier LinkedIn bio, he began working at Ozemail, where he was ""managing a bunch of engineers,"" thus starting his eventful career in tech. However, according to a 2007 Computerworld article, he began working in IT when he joined K-Mart in 1985 — which would have been even before he finished high school.In April 1997, Wright says he joined the Australian Stock Exchange, maintaining security and firewalls. In November the same year, he launched a company called DeMorgan, described as ""a pre-IPO Australian listed company focused on alternative currency, next generation banking and reputational and educational products with a focus on security and creating a simple user experience.""In fact, up until July 2015, Morgan was the CEO of about 15 companies. As the Guardian points out, in the space of a week, he resigned as director from Cloudcroft Pty Ltd, Coin-Exch Pty Ltd, Daso Pty Ltd, Demorgan Holdings Pty Ltd, Demorgan Ltd, Denariuz, Ezas Pty Ltd, Integyrz Pty Ltd, Misfit Games Pty Ltd, Interconnected Research Pty Ltd, Zuhl Pty Ltd and Pholus Pty Ltd, and remained the director of just three companies: Hotwire Preemptive Intelligence Pty Ltd, Panopticrypt Pty Ltd and Hotwire PE Employee Share Plan Pty Ltd. Currently, his LinkedIn only features a startup called nChain, where he has allegedly been working as a “chief scientist” since June 2015.Wright seems to be a man of libertarian views. According to the Cypherpunk mailing list archive, in September 1996, Wright wrote that he had developed cancer during his years at university and took a loan to pay for medical treatment because the health insurance didn’t cover it. He then mentioned that he served in the military and worked at a gas station “even though I am an engineer,” adding:“So why and for what reason should I have to pay several 10's of thousands each year to support others. I have never taken help from the government, I do not feel I should have to pay as well. And what am I paying for...to protect the status quo. I believe that there is more than enough help for ppl available. They just need to get off their butts and work.”In sum, Wright’s biography seems to be considerably replete and busy — or, at least, he portrays it that way. On top of having two PhDs, Wright wields numerous certifications in computer forensics and information technology (IT). In February, he published two Medium articles in which he claimed to have worked as an “agent of influence” in Venezuela and Colombia. Picturing himself as a James Bond-esque character fighting terrorism and evil, Wright says he was “shot twice” during the operation. Also, at some point, he claims that he “was a pastor once.”According to his story, the Australian entrepreneur came back from South America to witness Bitcoin — which he created (more about that below) — being used on the darknet.  “I discovered the creation I had given birth to, something I designed to bring light was being used for all the worst reasons. Not only drugs, but people. Anonymity is a curse. Nothing good comes of it.”Wright become a known figure in crypto community after media reports linking his identity to Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin, surfaced in late 2015. Previously, in 2014, one of his few reported links to cryptocurrencies was that he tried launching the world’s first Bitcoin bank.Thus, in December 2015, Wired and Gizmodo reported within hours of each other that the Australian computer scientist and entrepreneur might be the creator of the world’s largest cryptocurrency.The Wired story claimed that Wright ""either invented bitcoin or is a brilliant hoaxer who very badly wants us to believe he did."" It was based on documents and emails that were purportedly leaked by “an anonymous source close to Wright” to an independent security researcher Gwern Branwen, who co-wrote the article with Wired author Andy Greenberg.Similarly, Gizmodo ran a story that featured documents allegedly obtained by a hacker who accessed Wright's email accounts, claiming that Satoshi Nakamoto was a joint pseudonym for Craig Steven Wright and his friend, computer forensics analyst and cybersecurity specialist David Kleiman, who died in 2013.Moreover, on the same day the articles were published, Australian Federal Police (AFP) raided Wright’s house in the Sydney suburb of Gordon. However, the AFP clarified that the operation was not related to the Bitcoin claims.A substantial part of the evidence presented in the reports — along with Wright’s previous claims — was soon proved false. First, Wright's company Cloudcroft had declared to have two supercomputers, one of which allegedly produced by computer manufacturer SGI. However, SGI soon clarified that ""Cloudcroft has never been an SGI customer and SGI has no relationship with Cloudcroft CEO Craig Steven Wright.""Further, Wright had listed two PhDs on his LinkedIn page, including one from Charles Sturt University. Eventually, Forbes contacted the university and found out that it hadn’t granted Wright any PhDs, although it gave him three master's degrees in networking and systems administration, management (IT), and information systems security. Wright was, however, awarded with a doctorate degree by Charles Sturt University later in 2017.Also, a technical analysis of two PGP public keys attributed to Wright, but also linked to Satoshi Nakamoto, showed that they were created more recently than the documents in which they were featured.Finally, a number of posts in Wright's now-deleted blog that seemed to portray him as a person who was directly involved in Bitcoin’s creation had been backdated or edited; the archived versions of the posts from 2013 show none of those breadcrumbs that Wright could have planted to mislead the media into thinking he is Satoshi.After the aforementioned stories went live, Wright promptly took down his social media accounts and disappeared for several months. On May 2, 2016, he came back (he now lives in London, United Kingdom, according to his LinkedIn profile) and publicly declared that he is the creator of Bitcoin. Later on in the same month, Wright published a sentimental apology piece where he refused to publish the proof of access to one of the earliest Bitcoin keys, saying he doesn’t have the “courage” do it.However, Wright still claims to be the pseudonymous Bitcoin creator. Just last month, the entrepreneur filed two near-identical comment letters to the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in which he again declared that he is Satoshi. The documents were submitted in response to the agency’s request for industry input and feedback on Ethereum’s (ETH) mechanics and market.Specifically, Wright wrote that he worked “under the pseudonym of Satoshi Nakamoto,” and ""completed a project [...] started in 1997 that was filed with the Australian government in part under an AusIndustry project registered with the Dept. of Innovation as BlackNet.”  BlackNet — an alleged precursor to Bitcoin — was submitted to the Australian government in 2001, according to one of Wright’s tweets (he deleted his Twitter profile earlier this month).On Reddit, user Skoopitup argued that the BlackNet paper that Wright supposedly submitted in 2001 largely copied the official Bitcoin white paper (published October 2008), which notably contained significant corrections to an earlier draft that had been shared by Satoshi earlier in August 2008.In his remaining comments to the CFTC, Wright wrote:“The amount of misunderstanding and fallacious information that has been propagated concerning bitcoin [...] has resulted in my choice to start to become more public. The system I created was designed in part to end fraud as best as that can be done with any technology. The lack of understanding [...] has resulted in [...] a dissemination of old scams.”The Australian entrepreneur still hasn’t signed a message with the key associated with Bitcoin's genesis block, which could be seen as strong evidence of him actually being Satoshi Nakamoto.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is a cryptocurrency that emerged on Aug. 1, 2017 after departing from Bitcoin’s original blockchain via a hard fork in an attempt to manage its scalability issue.The BCH network performs hard forks as part of scheduled protocol upgrades. The fork scheduled for Nov. 15, 2018, however, was disrupted by a competing proposal that was not compatible with the original roadmap. As a result, the BCH community was split into three fractions: Bitcoin ABC, Bitcoin Unlimited and Bitcoin SV.Craig Wright lead the Bitcoin SV team, whose goal was to restore “the original Satoshi protocol” by changing the current BCH structure. Specifically, that involved entirely overwriting the network scripts of Bitcoin ABC and increasing the block size of BCH from 32MB to a maximum of 128MB in order to increase network capacity and scale. Bitcoin SV’s cryptocurrency design was made by Wright’s nChain company.At some point, after Jihan Wu, co-founder of major crypto miner and manufacturer Bitmain, who supported the Bitcoin ABC team, accused Wright of being a Blockstream spy and a “fake Satoshi.” In response, the computer scientist entered a verbal fight. Specifically, Wright tagged Roger Ver — another ABC proponent — and Bitmain with bankruptcy threats and accusations of being engaged in Silk Road machinations and child pornography.Even though Bitcoin ABC essentially won the so-called “hash wars” and secured the original BCH ticker, Bitcoin SV lives on. In late February, Bitcoin SV’s value rose 20 percent, driving it into the top-10 largest cryptocurrencies by market cap. As of press time, Bitcoin SV is the 12th-largest token, with a market cap of $1.5 million, according to CoinMarketCap.According to the publication Hard Fork, the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) has published 155 patents applications filed by Wright — all of which were submitted through his company nChain. Thirty-five of those were published this year. The earliest document date relates to Aug. 31, 2017.The majority of those applications mention blockchain. Specifically, Hard Fork writes, the term “blockchain” was used 114 times in patent titles. “Cryptocurrency,” in turn, is only featured six times, while “Bitcoin” is not mentioned at all.Wright has written about his patents quest via Twitter (which has been deleted). According to the screenshots cited by Hard Fork, Wright decided to file his patents in Europe because it was “harder”:“Once we have the EU, we have the PCT [Patent Cooperation Treaty] in the USA. The US is simpler.”The Patent Cooperation Treaty has been signed by 152 countries. After filing one international patent application under the PCT, applicants can get simultaneously protection for their inventions in many countries.As per Bloomberg, business-wise blockchain patents “are an essential ingredient for companies looking to reshape the financial services industry or spawn profitable cryptocurrency-related businesses.” Basically, such patents help companies attract investment, protect property rights and collect monopoly profits from other companies using their inventions.It’s been argued that Wright is filing patents without the intent of actually using them, but instead to demand large payouts from companies which happen to use similar technologies in their line of work. As Marc Kaufman, an attorney who co-chairs the Blockchain Intellectual Property Council at the U.S. Chamber of Digital Commerce, told Fortune:“His tactics and activities have all the marks of being a patent assertion entity or what’s pejoratively known as a troll. I’m not aware of his companies having any products.”In February 2018, the estate of David Kleiman — Wright’s associate and computer forensics expert who died in April 2013 seemingly of natural causes related to complications from a MRSA infection — brought the suit against Wright to the U.S. District Court of the Southern District of Florida. The estate is represented by Ira Kleiman, David’s brother.According to court documents that surfaced on Reddit, the plaintiff claims that Wright stole hundreds of thousands of BTC, worth over $5 billion dollars at the time, from David Kleiman’s estate. The statement by the plaintiff alleges that Wright recognized that Kleiman’s friends and family were initially unaware of the wealth he accumulated.Specifically, the statement reads, Wright “forged a series of contracts that purported to transfer Dave’s assets to Craig and/or companies controlled by him. Craig backdated these contracts and forged Dave’s signature on them.”Wright contacted Kleiman’s estate after his associate’s death and disclosed that he and David had worked together to develop blockchain and Bitcoin, according to the plaintiff.In December 2018, new documents were published online, indicating that the court had rejected repeated requests from the nChain chief scientist to dismiss the lawsuit.In an amended lawsuit supported by Judge Beth Bloom, a figure of 300,000 BTC ($1.5 billion as of press time) was now circulating.“The Court finds that Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged a claim for conversion,” the court document confirms, continuing:“The Amended Complaint alleges that Defendant converted at least 300,000 bitcoins upon Dave’s death and transferred them to various international trusts, which was an unauthorized act that deprived the Plaintiffs of the bitcoins therein. Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ claim for conversion [...] survives Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss.”In March 2019, Jeff Garzik, one of the earliest contributors to the Bitcoin codebase, was reportedly subpoenaed by the court for documents relating to the Kleiman vs. Wright complaint.Specifically, the court demanded “all documents, communications, and agreements that support his [Jeff’s] personal theory that Dave Kleiman is Satoshi Nakamoto.” In a 2018 interview with Bloomberg, Garzik suggested that Dave Kleiman was the original creator of Bitcoin.After some of the aforementioned inconsistencies related to Wright’s claim that he is Satoshi surfaced, the crypto community became increasingly skeptical about the Australian computer scientist. However, some of his claims in regard to other cryptocurrencies certainly didn’t help.In January 2019, for instance, he called Andreas Antonopoulos, author of the book “Mastering Bitcoin,” a “shitcoin expert.” In February this year, Wright told CNBC Africa’s Ran Neuner in a rather rude form that he knows how to deanonymize and destroy privacy coins Zcash and Monero, which he apparently is going to do “sometime this year”:“If you have a privacy coin, I will show you that it is basically as private as running through Times Square with your pants around your ankles.”In October 2017, in a now-deleted tweet, Wright argued that the Lightning Network was “oversold.”At the 2018 Deconomy conference in Seoul, South Korea, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin publicly questioned Wright’s competence, calling him a fraud.“Given he makes so many non-sequiturs and mistakes, why is this fraud allowed to speak at this conference?”In response, Wright tweeted: “Oh well.... looks like I broke Vitalek… :) He is a twig.. must remember to be gentle next time ....”Last week, the Australian entrepreneur deleted his Twitter page after removing over 10,000 tweets.On March 17, not long before erasing his presence on the social media outlet, Wright tweeted that he will be “taking action aggressively to remove any site that is in error or makes false claims,” referring to people calling him a fraud, among other things.  “You do not have a right to lies under ‘free speech’ nor harassment, nor libel and slander,” he wrote. “If an error is reported in a malicious context concerning me, expect to be living in a barrel when we finish with you.”"

pass all competition from extant payment networks. 13369 Total views.","Apr 4, 2019","Bitcoin (BTC) should usurp current global payment systems within the decade, a new report from software startup DataLight concluded on April 2.","In a report on transactions on the Bitcoin network versus those with Visa, MasterCard and PayPal, the company made the prediction that if Bitcoin’s current rate of network growth continues, it will beat out competition from market incumbents.“In just 10 years, Bitcoin has managed to compete with the leaders of the payment system industry. Bitcoin’s development is occurring exponentially,” the report’s conclusion reads. It continues:“If it maintains this pace, in another 10 years, it will surpass all competition.”The basis for that assumption lies in the already far greater number of nodes, lower fees and average transaction size, among other technical factors.Bitcoin, for example, has around 10,000 active nodes, compared with Visa’s 119 data centers, MasterCard’s 98 and PayPal’s 51.At the same time, Bitcoin has fewer users, in line with its only ten-year period on the market; Visa and MasterCard debuted in the 1950s and 60s, while PayPal followed in 1998.There are currently around 25 million Bitcoin wallets, while the number of Visa and MasterCard credit and debit cards in circulation has reached 5.3 billion, the report notes.To DataLight, however, these are signs of a work in progress. In the near future, advances will make Bitcoin an attractive proposition for mainstream consumers, taking it out of its technical niche environment, according to the report.Specifically, while the cryptocurrency can only handle around seven transactions per second at present compared to Visa’s 65,000, scaling solutions — principally the Lightning Network — have more than enough time to transform Bitcoin’s utility, DataLight writes.“Right now Bitcoin’s payment system is much superior to the conventional international payments and wire transfers,” the report highlights. It adds:“Technical improvement of Bitcoin’s network is almost certain to make it the world’s main payment system. This is why the bear trend of 2018 will be another dip before the exponential growth and new all time highs.”As Cointelegraph reported, last month saw other research sources eye 2020’s block reward halving event as a watershed moment for enthusiasm around Bitcoin. Its price, they argued, could begin reacting a year in advance, in June this year.The ten-year timeframe meanwhile echoes similar words from Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, who reiterated his belief in February that Bitcoin would become a form of global internet currency by 2028."

The report outlines that in Q1 2019:“[H]andling cryptocurrency continued to be a major source of friction for victims, and thus the threat actors as well. It is unlikely that ransomware rotates towards a different cryptocurrency anytime soon as they are even more nuanced to procure and handle.”Coveware notes that threat actors have scant need to migrate away from bitcoin to other coins as they reportedly face little difficulty using mixing services to exchange bitcoin for privacy-focused cryptos such as dash (DASH) or monero (XMR).Privacy coins are thus used for only 2% of ransomware payments, according to Coveware’s data, and are largely used later in the process, once the payment has been received and threat actors subsequently attempt to obfuscate the transfer of their ill-gotten funds.GandCrab — a strain of ransomware that accounts for 20% of the market, according to Coveware’s data — was the only prevalent strain where threat actors accept payment in either dash or bitcoin.Moreover, the report notes, GandCrab victims who pay with bitcoin face a 10% additional fee due to the costs incurred by the threat actors’ use of mixing services to anonymize the cryptocurrency after payment.As reported earlier this week, digital payments giant PayPal recently won a cybersecurity patent to protect users from crypto ransomware.In March, Big Four auditor PwC linked Iranian nationals behind the bitcoin ransomware scheme SamSam — which reportedly damaged multiple American companies, government agencies, universities, and hospitals —  to the crypto exchange WEX."

Customers then have to pass a Know Your Customer procedure, and once the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) or state deposit the refund, BitPay processes the payment and transfers it to the taxpayer’s crypto wallet.Leading financial industry players have been steadily embracing the tax issue when dealing with cryptocurrencies. Last month, Big Four auditing and professional services firm Ernst & Young launched a tool for accounting and preparing taxes on cryptocurrency holdings. The product can reportedly get information about crypto transactions from “virtually all” major exchanges, consolidate data from various sources, and automatically produce reports, including cryptocurrency-related IRS tax returns.In February, United States tax preparation software TurboTax Online partnered with CoinsTax, LLC to add cryptocurrency tax calculation to its services. The service will allow users to import trading data directly from major exchanges. Once calculated, capital gains and income reports can be downloaded or uploaded directly into Form 1040 Schedule D.On April 11, 21 different U.S. federal representatives sent a bipartisan letter to the IRS requesting guidance on how to report virtual currency taxes. The action took place before the filing deadline for federal income tax returns on April 15, 2019. Specifically, the letter asked the IRS to specify acceptable methods for calculating the virtual currencies’ cost basis, cost basis assignment and lot relief, as well as tax treatment of crypto hard forks, citing bitcoin’s fork bitcoin cash (BCH) that took place in August 2017."

Kleiman’s family allege that up to 1.1 million BTC was taken, which would be worth just shy of $9 billion at press time.Wright has made repeated requests to have the lawsuit dismissed, but back in December, Judge Bloom ordered that the case should proceed.Last month, Wright filed United States copyright registrations for the Bitcoin white paper authored by Satoshi Nakamoto, attracting controversy from commentators.Although the computer scientist has long claimed to be Nakamoto, a subsequent report by the Financial Times suggested that Wright’s registrations do not mean his claims are recognized by the U.S. government."

The links then direct to a download for the alleged tool, which is the Qulab trojan. After downloading, the trojan actually needs to be installed in order for it to be deployed.In addition to attempting to steal a plethora of user information, the Qulab trojan will also reportedly attempt to sneakily steal cryptocurrency for the bad actor by scanning for strings copied to the Windows clipboard which the program recognizes as crypto addresses, and then substituting in the attacker’s address instead.If a user pastes that string into a website field to specify where their funds are spent, they will paste in the attacker’s string instead and direct the funds there.The warning indicates that this is a viable strategy, since users are reportedly unlikely to remember or visually register that their intended crypto address — a long string of characters — has been swapped out for a different one.According to a report by Fumko, there is a long list of crypto addresses the trojan can recognize, including ones for bitcoin, bitcoin cash, cardano, ether, litecoin, monero, and more.As previously reported by Cointelegraph, YouTube purportedly advertised malware disguised as an advertisement for bitcoin wallet Electrum in March. Reddit user mrsxeplatypus described the scam, predicated on URL hijacking, as follows:“The malicious advertisement is disguised to look like a real Electrum advertisement [...] It even tells you to go to the correct link (electrum.org) in the video but when you click on the advertisement it immediately starts downloading the malicious EXE file.

Based on this — combined with the recent surge of the markets after a massive bear market of 2018 — Silbert stated that it “looks like, perhaps, we are coming out of a crypto winter and we’ve entered a crypto spring.”The DGG executive has also pinpointed the large involvement of institutions in the crypto industry, claiming that it has grown tremendously since the last bull market in 2017, when bitcoin hit its all-time record of $20,000. Citing big institutional crypto initiatives, such as the upcoming bitcoin custody offering by Fidelity, Silbert said that the institutional involvement of 2017 compared to the current interest of institutions is “really night and day.”Earlier this year, Silbert had predicted that the majority of digital tokens will lose their value in the long term, claiming that almost every initial coin offering (ICO) was “just an attempt to raise money but there was no use for the underlying token.”Recently, former JPMorgan executive and current blockchain researcher Tone Vays expressed skepticism about the supposition that the crypto winter is over. In opposition to Silbert, Vays argued that the recent spike in crypto prices was mainly supported by internal capital, which he considered shaky in comparison with external money coming into the space.Meanwhile, bitcoin has just broken the $8,000 threshold again after dropping below the mark yesterday."

This rise has been backed by an increase in Bitcoin futures open interest that hit an all-time high on the CME on June 17. The recovery from the lows has also helped bitcoin’s hashrate clock a new high. Both these are bullish signs and indicate that the rally is on firm ground.A new survey by Moscow-based cybersecurity firm Kaspersky Lab has stated that 19% of people across the world have bought cryptocurrencies before 2019. For a new asset class, this is a very high and impressive number. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse recently revealed that he was long on Bitcoin because he considered it a store of value.While the adoption of cryptocurrencies is increasing, it still has its naysayers. The Reserve Bank of Australia does not expect cryptocurrencies to find wide use in Australia if the existing financial system remains robust. Similarly, Patrick Gaulthier, vice president of Amazon Pay, said that they do not have any plans of creating crypto in the short-term as they do not deal in speculative assets.With the Bitcoin price topping $11,000, is it a good time to buy or should investors look to other altcoins? Let’s find out.The up-move of the past couple of days is reminiscent of the rally during the previous bull market. Bitcoin (BTC) has covered the distance from $10,000 to $11,000 within a day. It has broken out of the ascending channel and looks to be on target to reach the overhead resistance of $12,000. As the price has reversed direction from $12,000 on three occasions, between the end of January and early March of last year, we expect some resistance at this level.However, when a cryptocurrency is backed by momentum, it is difficult to predict where it will stop.Both the moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is deep in overbought territory. This suggests that the rally is looking stretched in the short term. However, in early April and mid-May of this year, the RSI had reached just above 88, which shows that there is some more room for the up-move to extend.If the BTC/USD pair breaks out of $12,000, it can move up to $13,000. But these vertical rallies are unsustainable. Therefore, we anticipate a minor correction or a consolidation for a few days. We do not suggest traders chase the price higher as the risk to reward ratio is not attractive.Ether (ETH) broke out of $225.49 to $280 range on June 21. Thereafter, it quickly rallied above the overhead resistance of $322.06 and came very close to its target objective of $335. However, profit booking has pushed the price back below $322.06. This shows a lack of demand at higher levels.Both the moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is in the overbought zone, which shows that the bulls are in command. If they can propel the ETH/USD pair above $322.06 and sustain it, there is no major resistance until $480.Ripple (XRP) has broken out of the symmetrical triangle, which is a positive sign. It can now move up to $0.57259 and above it to $0.6250. Both the moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is in the positive zone, which shows that bulls have the advantage.Our bullish view will be invalidated if the bulls fail to sustain the breakout and the XRP/USD pair plummets back below $0.450. Until then, every dip will be viewed as a buying opportunity. Traders can trail the stop loss on the long position to $0.41. We will suggest to raise the stop loss again as the price moves up.After trading in a small range near $140.3450 for the past few days, the bulls are attempting to resume the uptrend. Litecoin (LTC) has broken out of $140.3450 but is struggling to sustain it. This shows profit booking at higher levels. However, both the moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is close to the overbought zone, which shows that the path of least resistance is to the upside.The breakout and close (UTC time frame) above $143.3047 could propel the LTC/USD pair to $158.91 and above it to $184.7949. Conversely, if the pair turns down from current levels and breaks down of the 20-day EMA, momentum will weaken. Therefore, traders can protect the remaining long position with a stop loss below the 20-day EMA. As the price surges higher, traders can tighten the stops further to protect paper profits.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) bounced off the 20-day EMA on June 21. Currently, the bulls are trying to sustain above $481.99. If successful, a move to the resistance line of the ascending channel is probable. This might act as a minor hurdle, but if it is crossed, the rally can extend to $639 and above it to $889.On the other hand, if the BCH/USD pair struggles to break out of the overhead resistance, it might dip back to the 20-day EMA. It remains bullish as long as both the moving averages are sloping up and the price remains above the moving averages. It will signal a change in trend on a  breakdown and close (UTC time frame) below the support line of the channel.EOS bounced off the 20-day EMA on June 21. It is likely to rally to the resistance line of the channel. If this level is crossed, the next move is toward $8.6503 and above it, $9.30. The 20-day EMA is starting to turn up and the RSI has jumped into positive territory, which suggests that bulls have the upper hand. Traders can trail the stop loss on the long position to $6.40.If the EOS/USD pair struggles to break out of the resistance line of the channel or $8.6503, traders can book partial profits on about 50% of the long positions and trail the rest with a tight stop. The momentum will weaken if the price sinks below $6.8299 and the trend will turn bearish on a breakdown of the support line of the ascending channel. This can result in a fall to $4.4930.Binance Coin (BNB) has made a new high once again. This is a positive sign as it shows buying at higher levels. The price spiked to $43.2813888, close to our target objective of $46.1645899. However, profit booking at higher levels has dragged the price back near the breakout level of $38.6463356.If the bulls defend the support around $38.6463356, we anticipate another attempt to break out of $46.1645899. If successful, a move to $50 is possible, which is likely to act as a psychological resistance.Traders can book partial profits if the pair hits our target objective and trail the stop loss on the remaining long position to just below the 20-day EMA. However, if the BNB/USD pair plunges much below $38.6463356, it can drop to the 20-day EMA, which is an important support. A break of this support will weaken the momentum.Bitcoin SV (BSV) is looking strong as it is attempting to resume its uptrend. It clocked a new high of $255.620 today, but profit booking at higher levels has dragged the price lower. Both the moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is close to the overbought zone, which suggests that the bulls are in command.If the bulls sustain the rally above $240, the next level to watch is $307.789 and if this level is also scaled, the rally can reach $340.248. However if the BSV/USD pair fails to sustain above $240, it can correct to the 20-day EMA, which is likely to act as a strong support. If this support cracks, the drop can extend to $176.083, which is the 50% retracement of the recent rally.Stellar (XLM) has broken out of the downtrend line of the descending triangle. It can now move up to the overhead resistance of $0.14861760. A breakout and close (UTC time frame) above this level will complete an inverse head and shoulders pattern that can start a new uptrend. Therefore, traders can initiate long position as suggested in an earlier analysis.However, both moving averages are flat and the RSI is just above the midpoint, which suggests equilibrium between bulls and bears. The trend will turn in favor of the bears if the XLM/USD pair fails to sustain above the resistance line of the triangle and plunges below $0.11507853. The next support on the downside is at $0.0855.Cardano (ADA) is trying to break out of the overhead resistance at $0.10. In the previous five instances, the price had turned down from this resistance. This time, if the bulls succeed in breaking out of $0.10, the cryptocurrency will complete a rounding pattern that has target objective of $0.22466773. Therefore, we retain our buy recommendation given in an earlier analysis.  Nevertheless, if the ADA/USD pair fails to break out and close above $0.10, it is likely to remain range bound between $0.076254 and $0.10. The 20-day EMA has flattened out and the RSI is just above 50, which suggests consolidation in the short term. A breakdown of $0.076254 will signal that the bears are back in command.Market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange."

looks to obtain CFTC approval for the launch of its physically backed ...","May 13, 2019","The Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) is reportedly taking steps to ensure approval from the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) for its bitcoin futures contracts platform — Bakkt. ICE, the operator of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), recently acquired a cryptocurrency custodial service and are mulling plans to register Bakkt as a licensed trust in the state of New York.","If successful, these latest moves would see Bakkt become a registered bitcoin (BTC) custody platform. Recent reports also indicate that the company is in partnership with Bank of New York (BNY) Mellon for the storage of cryptocurrency security keys.As reported by Cointelegraph on Monday, April 29, 2018, Bakkt’s parent company, ICE, acquired Digital Asset Custody Company (DACC) — a cryptocurrency custodial platform. Adam White, chief operating officer of Bakkt, said the acquisition was an important cog in the wheel of the company’s plans to launch its physically backed bitcoin futures contracts.DACC offers native support for 13 blockchains, as well as more than 100 assets. According to the announcement, the DACC CEO and other team members will be assimilated into the Bakkt operational structure.The DACC purchase is the second such acquisition by Bakkt. Back in January 2019, the ICE subsidiary acquired back office assets belonging to the Rosenthal Collins Group (RCG) — an independent futures commissions merchant.Announcing the DACC acquisition via Bakkt’s Medium account, White explained:“DACC shares our security-first mindset and brings extensive experience offering secure, scalable custody solutions to institutional clients. The team’s experience integrating multiple blockchains and operating cutting-edge consensus mechanisms is a valuable addition to our team and future product line.”By acquiring DACC, it appears Bakkt is pushing even further with its goal of becoming the foremost institutional-grade cryptocurrency platform far beyond offering physically backed bitcoin futures. The purchase sees the ICE subsidiary positioning itself for cryptocurrency custodial status.Many commentators in the industry have consistently identified the emergence of trusted cryptocurrency custodial platforms as an important requirement for a more broad-based institutional adoption of the asset class. Cryptocurrency companies like Coinbase and Goldman Sachs-backed Circle have launched custody platforms for digital assets.Bakkt’s DACC purchase is part of a grander ambition to become a certified cryptocurrency custodian. ICE is reportedly looking to have the company registered as a trust in the state of New York.If successful, Bakkt would have the legal authority to act as a qualified custodian for bitcoin and other digital assets. Such a move, the company hopes, would smoothen the CFTC approval process.As part of its plan to offer robust cryptocurrency custody solutions, Bakkt is partnering with BNY Mellon to establish private key storage in multiple geographic locations. Back in 2018, the global banking behemoth announced plans to begin offering cryptocurrency custodial services.However, the change from “warehousing” digital assets to physical custody brings up questions about whether Bakkt is employing a change in its strategy. In response, Loeffler speaking to Fortune, said:“There is no pivot. From the ground up what ICE has been building for two years is the safest version of a custody solution for digital assets.”Loeffler’s comments aside, the original Bakkt application filing shows the company offering physically settled bitcoin futures contract with the physical delivery carried out via “warehousing,” as opposed to physical storage of the underlying asset.On the technical side, Bakkt’s approach to bitcoin futures bodes well from a price discovery standpoint but runs into issues when it concerns regulations. With Bakkt offering bitcoin futures contracts settled not in cash like CBOE or CME but in the underlying asset, there seem to be issues with balancing the various regulatory hurdles that need to be surmounted.The typical regulatory paradigm for derivatives trading in the U.S. involves a two-pronged approach of federal and state laws. The CFTC oversees exchange entities, clearing houses and the commodity being traded, while state regulators are in charge of the institutions that have custody of the underlying asset or other financial instruments.Thus, within this bifurcated regulatory paradigm, Bakkt’s plan of warehousing bitcoin via its parent company’s clearing house runs into a few regulatory snaps, chief of which is the fact that ICE isn’t a bank. The usual state-regulated custodian as recognized by the 1936 Commodity Exchange Act is a registered trust or a bank.Section 5b, clauses vi and vii of the Commodity Exchange Act: Settlement Procedures states:“(vi) Regarding physical settlement, establish rules that clearly state each obligation of the derivatives clearing organizations with respect to physical deliveries; and (vii) ensure that each risk arising from an obligation described in clause (vi) is identified and managed.”Usually, when such a regulatory gray area emerges, an agreement could be reached to grant an exemption, allowing Bakkt to use ICE’s clearing house infrastructure for its bitcoin contract. However, there is a major hindrance that could theoretically stand in the way of such an arrangement.To understand this hindrance, it is important to briefly describe how clearing houses work. As third-party intermediaries, clearing houses stand in the gap between buyer and seller to ensure the completion of the derivatives transaction, while keeping both parties in line with their respective part in the deal.The various constituent firms of the clearing house divvy up the risk involved in the transaction in a process called “risk mutualization.” In this arrangement if “constituent A” of the “XYZ clearing house” were to hold bitcoin, the other member firms would be open to the mutualized risk of BTC price fluctuation.There is a plausible scenario in which constituent firms of the ICE clearing house might not be open to one of its members holding BTC as part of the settlement process for Bakkt’s bitcoin futures contracts. A significant swing in the price of bitcoin during the transaction process could see these members firms incur negative interest rates on their own “custodied"" commodity futures.Originally earmarked for launch in December 2018, concerns over proper customer onboarding and warehousing for the bitcoin futures contracts caused the plans to be shifted to 2019. ICE released a press statement in November 2018 announcing the shifting of the launch date to January 2019.However, Bakkt failed to obtain the CFTC approval, which led to another postponement. According to reports, the major concern for the U.S. regulator was the company’s plan to settle bitcoin futures contracts via the ICE Clear US (ICUS) — a CFTC-regulated exchange and clearing house.Recently, the CFTC has increased its oversight on clearing houses as part of its efforts to protect investors in the derivatives market.On Wednesday, May 1, 2019, CFTC Chairman J. Christopher Giancarlo, testifying before the House Committee on Agriculture Subcommittee on Commodity Exchanges, Energy and Credit, said:“In addition, examinations of clearinghouses help the Commission identify issues that may affect a clearinghouse’s ability to control and monitor its risks. These are among the most important examinations that the Commission conducts, as clearinghouses have become critical single points of risk in the global financial system. Furthermore, the number of clearinghouses, the scope, and complexity of the examination issues and the importance of these examinations to overall financial stability are all increasing.”Given the novel nature of cryptocurrencies as an asset class, the CFTC likely feels that such plans fall into a gray area from a regulatory standpoint. Thus, the commission has been consistent in its insistence that Bakkt develop a more robust infrastructure for holding bitcoin and settling bitcoin futures contracts.While not directly referencing Bakkt or ICE, the CFTC chairman also commented about cryptocurrency-related companies applying for licenses to operate clearing houses. Speaking on the matter, the CFTC chair declared:“In addition to U.S. clearinghouses, the Commission has six registered clearinghouses located overseas and exempted four foreign clearinghouses. The Commission anticipates new applications for clearinghouse registration resulting from the explosion of interest in cryptocurrencies; an area in which protection of the cryptocurrencies will be one of the highest risks.”While stating the commission’s commitment to upholding robust regulatory standards, Chairman Giancarlo reiterated the CFTC’s aim of promoting innovation. The CFTC chairman, did, however, admit that regulators face numerous challenges in trying to adapt decades-old laws to novel digital asset classes.Cointelegraph reached out to both Bakkt and the CFTC for comments on the matter. Damon Leavell, the senior director of communications and marketing at ICE Americas, told Cointelegraph that the Bakkt team remains focused on building the business but declined to provide further comments. The CFTC has yet to provide any response to Cointelegraph’s request for comments.Despite the absence of official comments from both Bakkt and the CFTC, it appears the company’s initial custody plans have played a major part in the delays and postponements. Given the recent announcements and acquisitions, it appears Bakkt is trying to rectify these issues by pushing for self-certification as a cryptocurrency custodian.In a blog post published on Monday (May 13, 2019), Loeffler announced that Bakkt is moving forward with the launch of the bitcoin futures contract in July 2019. According to Loeffler, following continued consultations between the company and the CFTC, Bakkt plans to begin user acceptance testing (UAT) for its offerings by the middle of the year.The announcement still confirmed Bakkt’s plans of pursuing self-custody approval while implementing settlements via ICUS. However, there was no mention of any green light from the CFTC to that effect.Bakkt did not give a definite date for when the UAT will begin, but an excerpt from the announcement reads:“We’ll provide more details in upcoming posts, but we expect to use UAT to ensure that customers have time to onboard and can test the trading and custody model we’ve built to their satisfaction.”The Bakkt CEO did, however, provide some clarity on the structure of Bakkt’s proposed bitcoin futures contracts. The company plans to offer both daily and monthly physically settled BTC futures contracts.On Monday, ICE submitted two separate filings with the CFTC that contained the listing and certification details for both derivative offerings. Loeffler also announced that Bakkt would be putting up $35 million of its own money as a hedge against any clearing house risk."

The AMA was broadcast live on May 8, 3am UTC.","As reported yesterday, Binance suffered a major and premeditated hack, reportedly conducted by tactics that included phishing and viruses to obtain a large number of 2FA codes and API keys.The security breach reportedly resulted in hackers withdrawing around 7,000 bitcoin (BTC) — worth around $40.7 million at the time — from the exchange’s hot wallets, in a transaction that went undetected by the firm’s security systems.In today’s AMA, CZ updated the exchange’s initial figure for the theft to 7,070 bitcoin, noting that the hackers were advanced, persistent and patient and had waited to collect a significant volume of stolen account data before executing the attack.  In the incident’s aftermath, CZ said the exchange was “focused on rebuilding and recovering” its system, and that withdrawals and deposits would only be reactivated once this will have been completed — likely around a week.Both during the AMA and in a tweet thereafter, the CEO revealed that the exchange had considered — but decided against — responding to the hack with a so-called blockchain re-org approach: i.e. aiming to incentivize miners to form a consensus to wield 51% of the network’s hashing power to reorganize the blockchain’s transactions after the loss.As an evidently centralized response to hack, the idea was strongly critiqued by many community respondents. While conceding its possible advantages, CZ announced Binance had rejected the idea as it risks damaging the credibility of bitcoin, and could cause “a split in both the bitcoin network and community” — both of which outweigh the ostensible $40 million revenge, he said. He also noted the slim chances of the approach’s success.The CEO also used the AMA to thank community members for their generous offers of support, including Justin Sun, Coinbase, QKC, and a number of reported others — Sun having notably offered to personally deposit the 7,000 BTC to compensate Binance’s loss.The CEO said the exchange had sufficient funds to cover the theft, via its Secure Asset Fund for Users, which had been created in July 2018 as a type of emergency insurance.He also outlined the team’s security advice to users, saying it was highly recommended that users reset their 2FAs and that traders using API change their keys to ensure safety.Yesterday’s hack represented the highest-profile of a string of crypto exchange hacks so far in 2019 — including Cryptopia, CoinBene, DragonEx, and Bithumb.

business of cryptocurrency wallet provider Xapo for $50 million in cash.","May 16, 2019","American major cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase is reportedly negotiating the acquisition of the bitcoin (BTC) custody business of cryptocurrency wallet provider Xapo, technology-focused media outlet the Block reported on May 16.","Sources familiar with the matter reportedly told the Block that Coinbase has been vying with the digital currency wing of United States financial services giant Fidelity, Fidelity Digital Assets, for Xapo over the past several weeks to advance its custody business.Following the closure of the deal, Coinbase will reportedly pay about $50 million in cash to Xapo, with a contingent earn-out for remaining with the company.Founded in 2014, Xapo is a Hong Kong-based firm that provides a BTC wallet and a cold storage vault, as well as bitcoin-based debit card services. The company is backed by leading industry players such as venture capital firms Greylock Partners and Index Ventures, crypto investment companies Digital Currency Group, Winklevoss Capital and Blockchain Capital. Xapo reportedly holds $5.5 billion in assets under custody.Earlier this month, Cointelegraph reported that Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said that Coinbase Custody managed to get $1 billion in assets under management in just 12 months after its launch. He also mentioned that 70 institutions signed up to the service during that period.Coinbase officially launched its custody service for institutional investors in July of last year. At the time, the company revealed that it would enable its new institutional clients “to participate in the crypto ecosystem through proof of stake and distributed governance.” The company’s custody offering was set to be secured through a compliant and FINRA-member independent broker-dealer, Electronic Transaction Clearing (ETC).This week, Coinbase made a massive expansion of USD Coin (USDC) trading to customers in 85 countries. Along with the USDC announcement, Coinbase also revealed a major global expansion, adding 50 more jurisdictions to its coverage, including such countries as Brazil, South Africa and Taiwan, among others."

The white paper ...","May 28, 2019","American crypto investment manager Bitwise released a paper claiming that fake trading volumes by crypto exchanges do not impact bitcoin’s (BTC) price. Released on May 24, the white paper is an extended version of Bitwise’s March presentation alleging that 95% of volume on unregulated exchanges is fake.","Published on the official website of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the new white paper is based upon the research that Bitwise Asset Management presented to the SEC on March 17, 2019, as specified in the document.In the white paper, Bitwise reiterated the main points from the presentation released in March, including evidence that almost 95% of reported trading volumes in bitcoin by exchanges are fake or non-economic in nature.However, the new report also proves that those fake volumes do not affect price discovery in the real bitcoin spot market. The white paper demonstrates that effective arbitrage systems keep accurate prices on real global bitcoin spot exchanges, eliminating sufficient pricing discrepancies “in a matter of seconds.”As part of the research, the new white paper also reiterates the fact that a great number of advances and tools in the bitcoin market, such as the launch of regulated bitcoin futures, the entry of large algorithmic market makers and bitcoin custody improvements, “dramatically improve the efficiency” of BTC markets.The research also cites data from popular crypto analytics website CoinMarketCap, arguing that the volume numbers reported by the website and other data aggregators in the industry are “surprising because they are wrong.” Bitwise state that CoinMarketCap data are “wildly inflated” by a mix of fake volume and wash trading that “dramatically skews the public’s view of the bitcoin market in a negative way.”Earlier today, crypto media outlet The Block published its own research stating that up to 86% of total reported crypto trading volume is “likely fake,” based on correlation with exchanges’ websites traffic.Following Bitwise’s fake volumes report in March, CoinMarketCap promised to rearrange rankings of member exchanges.On May 1, CoinMarketCap announced an alliance called the Data Accountability & Transparency Alliance to provide “greater transparency, accountability, and disclosure from projects in the crypto space.” At the time, the firm warned that it will remove crypto exchanges from its calculations if they fail to provide obligatory data by June. Cointelegraph has recently released a follow up on the matter."

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.","Market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.The white paper for Facebook’s stablecoin might be released as early as June 18, according to multiple sources. This has been an eagerly awaited project as the social media giant along with its sister companies WhatsApp and Instagram can reach millions of customers.  In a recent interview, Laura McCracken, Facebook’s Head of Financial Services and Payment Partnerships for Northern Europe, confirmed that “the value of Facebook Coin will be secured with a basket of fiat currencies.” Over 100 people are working on the project with about 40 more openings yet to be filled.Igor Sechin, head of Russian oil company Rosneft has said that Facebook’s stablecoin might also be used to pay for the purchase of crude oil in the future. While Venezuela had previously attempted to link crude oil and cryptocurrency, its project failed due to various reasons. But if large producers like Russia start accepting cryptocurrency payments for their oil, it will give a big boost to the sector. With every passing day, the fundamentals of the sector are improving.Will prices respond positively to these developments? Let us find out.Bitcoin (BTC) has been trading between the 20-day EMA and the horizontal support of $7,413.46 for the past two days. Currently, the 20-day EMA is flat and the RSI is close to 50. This points to a consolidation in the near term.The chart is also showing the possibility of a head and shoulders pattern formation. Currently, the BTC/USD pair might be forming the right shoulder. The pattern will complete on a breakdown of the neckline. This breakdown has a target objective of $5,371.12. However, a head and shoulders pattern with an upward sloping neckline is less reliable. Hence, we will not become overly negative but will remain cautious.This pattern will be invalidated if the pair breaks out of the head at $9,053.12. If the bulls sustain the price above the 20-day EMA, a retest of the highs at $9,053.12 is likely. The failure of a negative pattern is a bullish sign. Hence, if the bulls sustain the price above $9,053.12, a quick rally to $10,000 is probable.Ethereum (ETH) is currently range bound between $225.39 on the downside and $280 on the upside. The 20-day EMA is flat and the RSI is just above the midpoint. This suggests that the cryptocurrency might consolidate for the next few days.A breakdown of $225.39 and the 50-day SMA can sink the ETH/USD pair to $167.20. On the other hand, if the bulls propel the pair above the resistance of the range at $280, it can move up to $322.06, which is likely to act as a stiff resistance.The best way to trade a range is to buy closer to the support and sell near the resistance. Therefore, we will wait for the pair to bounce from $225.39 before suggesting fresh long positions.Ripple (XRP) has formed a symmetrical triangle. A breakout of the overhead resistance at $0.45 and the resistance line of the triangle has a target objective of $0.57259. If this level is crossed, the rally can extend to $0.62.Conversely, if the bears sink the XRP/USD pair below the support line of the triangle, it gives a pattern target of $0.26741. However, the pair has strong support at $0.35660 and below it at $0.27795.The 20-day EMA is gradually creeping up and the RSI is above 50, which shows that the bulls have a slight advantage. Therefore, traders can retain the stop loss on the remaining long position at $0.35. We will trail the stops higher within the next few days.Litecoin (LTC) has bounced smartly from the 20-day EMA. This is a positive sign as it confirms that bulls are defending the first line of support and are not waiting for lower levels to buy.The bulls will now try to push the LTC/USD pair above the overhead resistance zone of $121.9018–$127.6180. If successful, the next target to watch is $158.91. There are minor resistances at $140 and $147. If the pair struggles at any level, we will recommend closing the remaining long position. Until then, stop losses can be maintained at $90. If we get an opportunity in the next few days, we will trail the stops higher to $98.We are closely watching the negative divergence on the RSI, which is the only bearish formation on the chart. Our bullish view will be invalidated if the cryptocurrency reverses direction from the overhead resistance zone and plummets below $91.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) continues to trade inside the ascending channel. The cryptocurrency is finding support closer to $360 but the bulls are struggling to sustain the price above the 20-day EMA. This shows a lack of demand at higher levels.The 20-day EMA is flattening out and the RSI is close to the center. This suggests a balance between the bulls and the bears. If the BCH/USD pair sustains above the 20-day EMA, the bulls will try to push it towards the resistance line of the channel.On the contrary, if the pair plunges below $360, it can drop to the support line of the channel. This is a critical level to watch. A breakdown of the channel will tilt the trend in favor of the bears. Currently, we do not find any reliable buy setups, hence, we remain neutral on the cryptocurrency.EOS has been trading between the 50-day SMA and the 20-day EMA for the past three days. On the upside, the bulls are likely to face stiff resistance at the 20-day EMA and above it at $6.8299.If the EOS/USD pair plummets below the 50-day SMA, it can decline to the support line of the ascending channel. This is a strong support as the bulls have repeatedly defended this line in the past few months. A breakdown of the channel will signal a deeper correction to $4.4930.On the other hand, if the bulls propel the price above $6.8299, a rally to the resistance line of the channel and above it to $8.6503 is possible. Traders can wait for a close (UTC time frame) above $6.8299 to buy with a stop loss of $5.80. If the price breaks out with force and closes (UTC time frame) near the resistance line of the ascending channel, traders should wait for a pullback to enter long positions. We do not suggest chasing the price higher.Binance Coin (BNB) broke down of the 20-day EMA on June 4 but the price did not drop to the 50-day SMA according to our expectation. It rebounded sharply from $28.0639659. This is a positive sign. Currently, the price is above the 20-day EMA. If the bulls sustain this level, a rally to $36 is probable.Conversely, if the BNB/USD pair fails to sustain above the 20-day EMA, the bears will again attempt to sink it to the 50-day SMA. This is a strong support as it has not been breached decisively barring on May 9. Hence, a breakdown of this level will signal a deeper correction and a comeback of the bears. We will watch for a couple of days and suggest long positions if we find a trade with good risk-to-reward ratio.Bitcoin SV (BSV) plunged on June 6 but found support close to the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of the recent rally. This is the second time bulls have defended this level. It now becomes an important level to watch on the downside.The bounce from $172.910 suggests strong buying on dips. If the bulls build up on the rebound, the BSV/USD pair can move up to $240, which might act as a resistance. A breakout of the $240–$254 overhead resistance zone will resume the uptrend that can carry the cryptocurrency to $307.789 and above it to $340.248.Our assumption will be negated if the pair turns around and plummets below $172.910. Below this level, the fall can extend to $152.015, which is the 50% retracement level of the recent rally. As the risk is high, we are not proposing a trade in it.Stellar (XLM) is range bound between $0.11507853 and $0.14861760. It found support at the bottom of the range on June 4 and 6. If the price sustains above the 20-day EMA, the bulls will try to push it to the resistance of the range at $0.14861760. A breakout and close (UTC time frame) above the range will complete an inverse head and shoulders pattern, which has a target objective of $0.22466773. We will wait for the breakout before recommending a long position.On the other hand, if the XLM/USD pair fails to sustain above the 20-day EMA, the bears will again try to sink it below the support at $0.11507853. A breakdown of this critical support will be a negative sign and can result in a deeper fall to $0.08558676.Tron (TRX) is trading inside an ascending channel. The price bounced off the support line of the channel on June 4 and 6. This is a positive sign. However, the dip on June 6 might have hit the stops on the long positions if the traders had purchased on May 15.The bulls will now attempt to push the price back to the overhead resistance of $0.040. If this level is scaled, the TRX/USD pair can move up to $0.050. Our bullish view will be invalidated if the pair turns down and breaks below the support line of the channel. Such a move can plunge the cryptocurrency to the critical support of $0.02815521.Market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange."

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.","Market data provided by HitBTC exchange.While markets have looked bullish this week following a sharp surge May 3, traders need to watch out for a correction in the next few days. This pullback will shake out the weak hands and will differentiate between different digital currencies. While some will lose only a part of their recent gains, others will plunge towards their lows again.The stronger ones are likely to lead the next bull market in cryptocurrencies. Therefore, traders should buy strength after the pullback ends. If our assumption is correct, the current fall should offer a great opportunity to buy for the long-term. Our view will be invalidated if cryptocurrencies give up all the gains made over the past few weeks.A survey by financial consultancy firm DeVere Group shows that 68% of high-net-worth individuals across the globe will have invested in cryptocurrencies by the end of 2022. One of the major reasons for investing in cryptocurrency is their borderless nature, which makes the assets available across the globe.Atom (ATOM), the native crypto asset of the Cosmos blockchain, made an impressive start as it made a place for itself among the top 15 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization within a very short span of time. Its price received a boost as it was listed on Binance, without even trying. However, while the initial response has been bullish, can the momentum continue in the best performing major cryptocurrency of the past week or is it time to take some chips off the table? Let’s take a look.The ATOM/USD pair has a very short trading history; hence, we are using a daily time frame chart on it. The pair witnessed huge volatility on its listing day. From a high of $8.90 on April 22, it plunged to a low of $2.9277 on April 24. That was a drop of 67.10%. However, since then, the recovery has been sharp. The price has reached close to the 38.20% Fibonacci retracement of the recent fall. A rally above this resistance can push the price to $5.9139, which is the 50% retracement level.The level between $5.9139 to $6.6186 will act as a stiff resistance. Any breakout of the 61.80% Fibonacci retracement can propel the digital currency to $8.90. However, if the price turns down from the current levels, it can drop to the next support of $3.60.The recovery in market prices pushed the mining hashrate of Dash (DASH) to an all-time high of 3.2385 petahashes on April 19, bettering its previous record of 3.237 petahashes set in early November 2018. It has since then again improved on the record to 3.8957 petahashes on May 2.In order to solve the issues faced by Dash merchants, Dash Retail has released a merchant transaction counter for its point-of-sale app and a conversion rates API to provide accurate conversion rates to fiat currencies.The DASH/USD pair corrected to the breakout level of the range in the week before this past one. We like that the price has sustained above the 20-week EMA since breaking out of it. The bulls are currently attempting to resume the recovery. It will pick up momentum after it breaks out of the overhead resistance between $138.709 and the 50-week SMA. Above this zone, the pair can rally to $225.On the other hand, if the digital currency reverses direction and plunges below $103.261, it will re-enter the range. This will weaken it and can result in a fall to the yearly low.Car manufacturer Jaguar Land Rover will reward drivers by giving them MIOTA tokens for data reporting. These tokens can thereafter be redeemed for various products. The Austin Transportation department in the city of Austin, Texas has collaborated with Iota Foundation to work towards a more interoperable transportation ecosystem.The MIOTA/USD pair has been range bound between $0.244553 and $0.385033 since the end of December last year. The bears attempted a breakdown of this support in the week before but failed. Buyers quickly pushed the price back in the range. However, the pair is facing resistance at the 20-week EMA. If the price can scale above this resistance, it will challenge the top of the range at $0.385033.A breakout of the range is likely to start a new uptrend that can carry the price to the psychological resistance of $0.50. On the other hand, a breakdown below $0.244553 will sink it to lows. The longer the digital currency remains in the range, the stronger its eventual breakout will be.Bitcoin (BTC) prices have risen sharply over the past seven days. Fundstrat analyst Robert Sluymer believes that this is the start of a new uptrend and investors should buy more on any pullback. He expects the price to zoom past $6,000 in the second half of the year.It is interesting to note that bitcoin’s dominance has increased from about 50% to 55.5% in about a month. This shows that traders are currently favoring bitcoin over other altcoins. More and more people are now aware of Bitcoin and about 11% of the American population has already invested in it, according to a survey by Spencer Bogart of Blockchain Capital.Grayscale Investments has started a “Drop Gold” campaign where it portrays BTC as an alternative to gold investments. With all these bullish noises, should one buy now or wait?The BTC/USD pair has reached the stiff overhead resistance of $5,900. This is a critical level because the pair had repeatedly taken support close to it since February to early November, before breaking below it. Now on the way up, we expect a lot of supply to hit around these levels.But the price has risen above both moving averages, which is a positive sign. If the bulls can continue the momentum and ascend $5,900, the digital currency can rally to $6,480.54. We do not expect the zone between $6,000 to $6,480.54 to be crossed in a hurry. A minor correction or a consolidation around these levels is likely.On the downside, support is at $4,914.11. If this level breaks, it will dampen sentiment and can drag the price to the next support at $4,255. Traders who have missed out buying in this recovery can wait for dips to buy, instead of chasing the rally.The next hard fork on bitcoin cash (BCH) is slated for May 15. Schnorr signatures, a scaling and privacy code change, will go live on the coin’s mainnet to improve the cryptocurrency’s privacy and scalability.Since the surge in early April, the BCH/USD pair has largely been consolidating between $255 and $335.62. The attempt by the bears to plummet below this range in the last week found buyers at the 20-week EMA. Currently, the bulls are attempting to push the price towards the top of the range.If the pair breaks out of the range and the minor resistance at $363.30, it can rally to the 50-week SMA and above it to $600. The digital currency has a history of vertical rallies; hence, it is likely to surprise to the upside.Our bullish view will be invalidated if the digital currency plunges below the support of the 20-week EMA. In such a case, a fall to $166.25 is probable.Market data provided by HitBTC exchange. Charts for analysis provided by TradingView."

The Lightning Torch is passed by sending the same BTC from user to user adding a little every time via the scalability solution, Lightning Network (LN).Bitcoin Venezuela is reportedly responsible for the humanitarian initiative “Bitcoin for Venezuela,” recently reporting it had given away meals to people in the country during a power outage.The organization also seemingly partnered with the donation-funded Locha Mesh Network development initiative. The project aims to develop cheap and open source do-it-yourself devices capable of maintaining an independent, decentralized and censorship-resistant network, allowing its users to communicate securely and send Bitcoin without access to the internet.The Twitter user who first initiated the Lightning Torch relay has recently become embroiled in a conflict with Craig Wright — the industry figure behind the coin Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (BSV) who is also known for proclaiming himself to be Satoshi Nakamoto on multiple occasions.Pro-BSV media outlet Coingeek reported on April 11 that Wright has set a $5,000 bounty in BSV for information regarding the identity of Hodlnaut, after the latter allegedly posted “highly defamatory and abusive tweets” about Wright.The CEO of major cryptocurrency exchange Binace Changpeng Zhao then stepped in with a tweet on April 11, saying that if Wright does not change his conduct, Binance delist BSV from its platform.In February, the Lightning Torch was passed on by LinkedIn co-founder and former PayPal exec Reid Hoffman. Before him, Twitter co-founder and CEO Jack Dorsey also passed the Torch, as did many other high-profile figures in crypto and finance."

Bitwise's bitcoin ETF application, soliciting the public for comment.","May 14, 2019",The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has again delayed its decision on cryptocurrency index fund provider Bitwise Asset Management’s bitcoin (BTC) exchange traded fund (ETF). The development was revealed in a filing published by the SEC on May 14.,"In the recent filing, the SEC revealed that it has delayed its decision on whether to approve or disapprove Bitwise’s ETF, and also requested for a public comment from interested parties. The Commission thus asks interested persons to “provide written submissions of their views, data, and arguments with respect to the issues identified above, as well as any other concerns they may have with the proposal.”Bitwise initially filed for an ETF in February under the condition that the SEC would reach a decision in 45 days. The firm’s proposed bitcoin ETF reportedly differs from other previously proposed bitcoin ETFs in that it draws prices from a variety of cryptocurrency exchanges, with the aim of better representing the market.In its original filing, Bitwise specifically states that its bitcoin ETF would require “regulated third-party custodians to hold its physical bitcoin.”“Having a regulated bank or trust company hold physical assets of a fund has been the standard under U.S. fund regulation for the last 80 years, and we believe that is now possible with Bitcoin,” it says.Тhe SEC had first delayed its decision on the Bitwise ETF application in March. Following the decision, the SEC was obligated to come to a decision on whether to approve the rule change by May 16, 2019.Per today’s filing, the public comment period will last three weeks after the most recent amendments to the Bitwise ETF application are published in the Federal Register, followed by two weeks for responses.In December of last year, SEC commissioner Hester Peirce, dubbed “Crypto Mom” by the community for her dissent with the SEC’s decision to reject a bitcoin ETF proposed by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, said that a cryptocurrency or bitcoin ETF is “definitely possible,” but it could be years away."

After a sharp up move, it was natural for traders to book profits on their quick gains. While altcoins have pulled back sharply from their recent highs, bitcoin has held up quite well. Its dominance has gradually inched from about 50% in early-April to 54.5%.During times of crisis in the industry, investors usually take refuge in bitcoin. Following the recently reported scandal involving crypto exchange Bitfinex and stablecoin tether (USDT), traders have converted their tether into bitcoin. Though both firms have issued a joint statement denying any wrongdoing, investors are playing it safe.Such events give an opportunity to traditional brokerages to enter the nascent space as they offer a trusted relationship to their clients. The latest to take the plunge is online trading firm E*Trade Financial Group as it reportedly readies to offer cryptocurrency trading in BTC and ether (ETH) on its platform. E*Trade had 4.9 million brokerage accounts on Dec. 31 of last year. With such a massive reach, the move would be an important one for cryptocurrency adoption.Bitcoin completed a bullish crossover this week for the first time since October 2015. This move arguably indicates a trend reversal. The bear market has seen a lot of investors lose huge sums of money. One among them was a seasoned investor, Japanese billionaire and founder of multinational conglomerate SoftBank Group, Masayoshi Son who booked a loss of about $130 million trading bitcoin.While many consider bitcoin to be digital gold, a recent survey in Europe found that only 49% of respondents believe that BTC will be around 10 years from now. This shows that cryptocurrencies will have to evolve further to be accessible and friendly to the non-tech savvy public.The BTC/USD pair has largely stayed above the breakout level of $4,914.11 for the past three weeks. But the bulls are struggling to push the price to the next overhead resistance of $5,900.Currently, the 50-week SMA is acting as a resistance. If the bulls defend the $4,914.11 levels again during the next fall, it will indicate buying at lower levels and the pair might remain range bound for a few more weeks. Consolidation at these levels is a positive sign.But if the price rebounds sharply from the current levels or from $4,914.11, the cryptocurrency could rally to $5,900. We anticipate a stiff resistance at this level.  On the downside, if the bears sink the pair below $4,914.11, it can drop to the 20-week EMA and below it to $4,255.The next couple of weeks are very important as it will set the stage for the next leg of the move.When all the top 20 coins are in the red, it shows that the markets are at a risk of turning down. Nem (XEM) was the second-best performer this week as it fell by about 9% in the past seven days. What is in store? Can it stage a recovery or will it continue to slide further? Let us find out.The recovery in the XEM/USD pair hit a roadblock at the overhead resistance of $0.07790717. The price has been correcting for the past three weeks. The bulls will attempt to defend the support at $0.060 and below it $0.053. If these supports breakdown, a retest of the lows is probable.On the other hand, if the pair rebounds from $0.060, the bulls will again try to propel it above the overhead resistance of $0.07790717. If successful, it can move up to the 50-week SMA at $0.10 and above it to $0.13. The cryptocurrency is yet to form a reversal setup. We shall wait for it to show some strength before turning positive on it.Bitcoin SV (BSV) has been in the news for the past few days as a few exchanges delisted it. After the initial plunge, prices seem to be stabilizing. The delisting put it and its creator, Craig Wright, in the limelight. Ayr United, a football team in Scotland, has signed a sponsorship that will feature the bitcoin SV logo on its shirts.The BSV/USD pair had been trading inside a range of $102.580 and $58.072 for the past few weeks. It turned down from the top of the range three weeks back and since then has been facing strong selling due to the negative news surrounding it.The bears broke below the support of the range at $58.072 and continued lower. Currently, the bulls are attempting to rebound from the psychological support of $50. If the bulls carry the price back into the range, we can expect the pair to consolidate between $58.072 and $102.580 for the next few weeks.But if the bulls fail to ascend above $58.072, the bears will again try to breakdown the support at $50. If that happens, a retest of the lows at $38.528 is possible.The co-founder of Ethereum has proposed increasing Ether staking rewards once the protocol switches to Proof of Stake (PoS). Meanwhile, Ethereum developers this week announced that they had raised the required funding for a third-party audit of the ProgPoW code.In other news, reports recently surfaced that Samsung plans to develop a public-private blockchain based on Ethereum.

It invalidates the bullish breakout of the ascending triangle pattern. The next support on the downside is $144.78. If this also breaks, the drop could extend to the trendline of the ascending triangle.However, if the pair rebounds off the support at $144.78, the bulls will again try to scale above $167.32. If successful, the next overhead resistance is $187.98. If this level is crossed, the pair is likely to pick up momentum and quickly rally to its target objective of $251.64. As it has formed a reversal pattern at the bottom, this target price might even be crossed.Binance’s token sale platform Launchpad successfully completed the sale of Matic Network (MATIC) tokens through its new lottery system. About 58.38% of the applicants benefitted from the lottery. Binance completed the launch of its decentralized trading platform (DEX) just a week after launching its own blockchain, Binance Chain.Binance also launched its much-awaited exchange in Singapore, where it initially plans to offer bitcoin trading using Singapore dollars. Binance coin (BNB) is still holding out close to its lifetime highs. What is its next likely direction? Let’s take a look.The BNB/USD pair came within a whisker of breaking out to new highs but failed to do so. The pair is facing selling at the resistance line of the wedge pattern. However, the positive point is that the pullback has been shallow. This shows that the buyers are keen to step in even on a minor dip.If the pair stays above the uptrend line of the wedge, it might enter into a consolidation for a couple of weeks, after which we expect another attempt by the bulls to make a new high. A new high is likely to attract more buyers and the cryptocurrency might surprise on the upside.Our bullish view will be invalidated if the bears sink the pair below the uptrend line of the wedge. A breakdown of the wedge is a bearish pattern that can result in a quick drop to the 20-week EMA.  Market data provided by HitBTC exchange. Charts for analysis provided by TradingView."

The service was purportedly one of the three largest mixing services for cryptocurrencies including bitcoin (BTC), litecoin (LTC), bitcoin cash (BCH) and others.After initiating an investigation back in June 2018, the FIOD, along with Europol and Luxembourg authorities, have banned the platform, as they found that a large number of mixed coins on Bestmixer came from criminal activity and were allegedly used for money laundering or illegal financing.As Europol noted, Bestmixer’s closure is the first legal enforcement action of its nature against a cryptocurrency tumbler. At press time, the Bestmixer website is not operating, with a FIOD notice claiming “you are not anonymous.”Screenshot of Bestmixer website at press timeThe FIOD reportedly collected data on all the transactions on the platform in the past year, including chat messages, bitcoin addresses, IP-addresses and more. The authority is planning to analyze the acquired information and share the results with other countries, Europol noted.At press time, a number of crypto mixers can be found online, including ChipMixer, BitMix.Biz and BitBlender, among others.Recently, Europol and German police seized the servers of a dark web marketplace, taking six figures in crypto from the arrested suspects."

In June, the Chicago Board Options Exchange’s bitcoin futures will expire with no current plans for renewal, leaving the CME as the sole offerer of BTC futures.TP ICAP also reportedly expects to add non-deliverable forwards tied to the largest cryptocurrency, and then plans to open desks in Asia and the United States. Bloomberg claims that the company took the decision due to a decrease of its core business model:“Interdealer brokers have traditionally relied on handling trades for banks, but their volumes shrunk in the aftermath of the financial crisis. A profit warning last year wiped 36% from TP ICAP’s market value in a day. It’s regained about 10% since then to 1.6 billion pounds ($2 billion).”The author of the report also points out that customers have to comply with Know Your Client and Anti-Money Laundering regulations in order to access bitcoin through the firm’s services. Furthermore, TP ICAP also reportedly considers other digital assets, such as altcoins and tokenized, to be real-world assets. Bloomberg quotes the firm’s head of digital asset market, Duncan Trenholme, illustrating the company’s interest in the industry:“We want to be close to what’s happening within this nascent asset class because we believe it’s important to invest in the early stages of a growing market. [...] TP ICAP also understands that this technology could disrupt or impact other asset classes where we currently operate, so we feel it’s important to be informed.”According to the company’s 2018 financial results disclosure, TP ICAP reported a revenue of £1,763 billion ($2.219 billion) last year.As Cointelegraph reported earlier today, bitcoin surpassed one million daily active addresses on June 14, according to blockchain statistics website CoinMetrics.Earlier this week, JPMorgan Chase wrote in a report that the Bitcoin industry has changed considerably since 2017, citing an increase in institutional interest."

These appointments show that the firm is able to attract talent from the traditional heavyweights, which is positive.Blockstack is planning to launch a $50 million token sale that is SEC-qualified. If approved, this will be the first sale under the SEC Regulation A+ framework. Harvard Endowment fund is expected to participate in the purchase.   While the blockchain and cryptocurrency space has a lot of potential, their adoption is still not widespread. A survey of 90,000 developers by the website StackOverflow shows that 80 percent of organizations are still not using blockchain. However, Frank Xiong, vice president of blockchain product development at Oracle expects 50 percent of all companies to use blockchain within the next three years.The developments in the sector are encouraging, but the industry still lacks the full-fledged involvement of institutional players. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon has denied that the bank ever wanted to open a crypto trading desk, as reported by the media a few months back.After the recent spell of profit booking, let’s see what the charts project.We were expecting Bitcoin (BTC) to rally to $5,600 and above it to $5,900 following the breakout above $5,309.31. But the digital currency turned down from $5,404.82. It is currently attempting to hold the support at $4,914.11. The 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of the recent upswing is also located close to this level. If the price rebounds from the current levels, it will indicate that sentiment has changed from sell on rallies to buy on dips. The immediate target on the upside is $5,600 and above it $5,900.Both the moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is close to the overbought zone. This shows that the bulls are in command and the trend remains up.The BTC/USD pair will turn negative if it turns down from the current level and slides below the 20-day EMA. Therefore, we suggest traders keep the stop loss on the remaining long positions at $4,600.Ethereum (ETH) declined below the breakout level of $167.32 on April 11. This is a bearish sign. After a breakout of a major pattern like the ascending triangle, we expected the $167.32 level to hold. However, the bulls are trying to defend the 20-day EMA. If they can push the price back above $167.32 quickly, it will indicate buying at lower levels.The ETH/USD pair will pick up momentum if the bulls scale above $187.98. The target remains $251.64. Our bullish view will be invalidated if the pair turns around from the current levels or from $187.98 and plummets below the 20-day EMA. Such a move will confirm that the breakout was a bull trap. For now, traders can retain the stop loss on the remaining long positions at $150.Ripple (XRP) broke below the immediate support of $0.350 and the 20-day EMA on April 11. It has again re-entered the descending channel, which is a bearish sign. The bulls are presently trying to defend the 50-day SMA.Both the moving averages have flattened out and the RSI is close to 50. This points to a consolidation in the short-term. If the XRP/USD pair rises above the resistance line of the descending channel, it might move up to $0.37835. A breakout of this level will signal a change in trend that can be bought.However, if the pair breaks down of the 50-day SMA, it can drop to $0.27795. We do not find any reliable buy setup at the current level; hence, we are not suggesting any trade in it.Litecoin (LTC) witnessed profit booking as it failed to climb above $91 on April 10. The correction stalled at the 20-day EMA. Currently, the bulls are trying to stabilize the price around the 20-day EMA and resume the recovery.The 20-day EMA is flattening out and the RSI has dropped to just above the midpoint. This suggests consolidation in the short term. However, the long-term trend remains up as the 50-day SMA is still trending higher.The LTC/USD pair will face resistance in the $91 to $100 zone on the upside. If this zone is crossed, the next targets to watch are $159 and above it $180. On the other hand, if the pair sinks below the 20-day EMA, it can fall to $62.450. We will watch for a couple of days before recommending long positions once again.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) dipped below the range of $272.41 to $332.58 and triggered our suggested stop loss of $265 on the remaining long positions. Currently, it is attempting to bounce back from the 20-day EMA, which is a positive sign. This shows that the bulls are keen to defend the first major support of the 20-day EMA.The BCH/USD pair can now move up to $332.58 and above it to $363.30. If the bulls push the price above this resistance, the rally can extend to $451.32. There is a minor resistance at $400 but we expect it to be crossed. Both the moving averages are trending up and the RSI is in the positive zone. This indicates that the bulls have the upper hand.However, if the bulls fail to push the price above $332.58, the digital currency might remain range bound between $255 and $332.58 for a few days. We shall wait for a reliable buy setup to form before proposing long positions once again. The trend will favor the bears if the cryptocurrency dives below $239.As the RSI was deeply overbought, we had recommended trailing the remaining long positions with a close stop loss in our previous analysis. EOS reversed direction from the resistance line on April 10. Due to the fall, the RSI has dropped out of the overbought zone.The bulls are trying to bounce off the 20-day EMA. If successful, the EOS/USD pair might again move up to the resistance line and if that is crossed the up-move can extend to $6.8299. With both the moving averages still sloping up, the bulls are at an advantage.Our positive view will be invalidated if the bears sink the pair below the 20-day EMA. In such a case, the digital currency might consolidate in a large range of $4.4930–$6.8299 for a few more days.Binance Coin (BNB) broke down of the ascending channel and the 20-day EMA on April 11, but buying on dips has again pushed the price back above the 20-day EMA, which is a positive sign. It shows that the bulls continue to buy on every dip and have been defending the 20-day EMA aggressively.With the recent correction, the 20-day EMA has flattened out and the RSI has dipped back into neutral territory. This points to a range formation in the short term. Nonetheless, the long-term trend still remains up as the 50-day SMA is sloping up.The BNB/USD pair might rise to $22 after it closes above the downtrend line. On the downside, it has strong support at the 50-day SMA. We remain positive on the pair and will suggest long positions once again at the first available opportunity. Our bullish view will be negated if the bears sink the price below the 50-day SMA.Stellar (XLM) continues to trade inside the wedge. It slipped below the 20-day EMA and triggered our recommended stop loss of $0.1130 on the remaining long position. Currently, the bulls are trying to defend the 50-day SMA.Both the moving averages are flattening out and the RSI has dipped back to the neutral zone. This points to a consolidation in the near term. The XLM/USD pair has support at the uptrend line and resistance at $0.14861760. It will pick up momentum and signal a trend change if it sustains above $0.14861760. Until then, we remain neutral on the digital currency.Cardano (ADA) turned around from the overhead resistance of $0.094256 and plunged below the support at $0.082952 on April 11. The down move triggered our suggest stop loss at $0.080 on the remaining long positions. It is currently attempting to bounce off the 20-day EMA, which is a positive sign. The bulls will again try to ascend the overhead resistance of $0.094256. If successful, the target on the upside is $0.20 with a minor resistance at $0.112598But if the ADA/USD pair turns down and dips below the 20-day EMA, it can decline to the 50-day SMA. However, with both the moving averages still sloping up and the RSI in positive territory, the path of least resistance is to the upside. We shall watch for a couple of days and recommend entering long positions once again if we find a reliable buy setup.Tron (TRX) plunged back into the range on April 11. This is the third time the digital currency has re-entered the range after breaking out of it this year. It shows that demand dries up at higher levels.After the sharp fall on April 11, the TRX/USD pair is trying to take support close to the 50-day SMA. If the bulls push the price back above $0.02815521, it will be a positive development. The pair will pick up momentum after it crosses $0.03575668. The target levels to watch on the upside are $0.040 and above it $0.0480.However, if the price fails to bounce off the current levels, it can plummet below the 50-day SMA to $0.02094452. Therefore, we suggest traders retain the stop loss on the long positions at $0.0240.Мarket data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. Charts for analysis are provided by TradingView."

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.","Market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.There is a large disconnect between traditional investors and crypto investors on how they approach cryptocurrencies. Billionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller said that he would neither buy nor sell Bitcoin because he does not find inherent value in it. He also said that due to its sharp volatility, Bitcoin can never be a medium of exchange.Another investor, Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley’s believes that Bitcoin can be used as a leading indicator to forecast the directional movement in the stock markets or gold. But he prefers to own gold over Bitcoin.Compare this with analytical firm Delphi Digital recently terming Bitcoin as the “King of the Assets Class Hill” because of its huge outperformance in May, compared to traditional asset classes. It is worth noting the uncorrelated performance of Bitcoin, which makes it a valuable addition to any portfolio. Should traders buy now or wait for lower levels? Let’s take a look at the charts.We had projected that the Bitcoin (BTC) rally is tiring out and that is what happened. It plunged on June 3 and 4, which pulled it back to the critical support of $7,413.46. Currently, the bulls are attempting to hold the level but the rebound lacks strength, which is a negative sign.The bears will try to make use of this opportunity and sink the BTC/USD pair below $7,413.46. If successful, the pair can plummet to the 50-day SMA. This is a critical level to watch because the bears have not been able to close below it since February 18. A breakdown will indicate that the trend has changed.Our view will be invalidated if the bulls defend $7,413.46. In such a case, a consolidation between $7,413.46 and $9,053.12 is possible. The cryptocurrency will pick up momentum above $9,053.12. We will wait for the correction to end before suggesting long positions once again.Ethereum (ETH) corrected back close to the support of $225.39 on June 3 where buying emerged. The 20-day EMA is flattening out and the RSI has dipped closer to the center. This points to a consolidation in the near term.If the bulls defend $225.39, the cryptocurrency might rally to $280 where it is again likely to face resistance. On the other hand, a breakdown of $225.39 will indicate weakness and can plummet the ETH/USD pair to the 50-day SMA. We expect a strong support at this moving average because the pair has taken support on it repeatedly since March. We are currently neutral on the digital currency.We hope traders booked partial profits closer to $0.45 as we had suggested in our previous analysis. The repeated failure to scale above the overhead resistance of $0.45 attracted profit booking that has dragged Ripple (XRP) to the critical support of $0.37835. The failure of the bulls to defend the 20-day EMA is a negative sign.Currently, the 20-day EMA has flattened out and the RSI is close to 50. This points to a probable range formation in the short term. Our view will be invalidated if the bears sink the XRP/USD pair below the $0.37835–$0.35660 support zone. Therefore, traders can protect the remaining long position with the stop loss of $0.35.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has broken down of the 20-day EMA. This is a sign that upward momentum has weakened. The earlier support of 20-day EMA will now act as a resistance. If the bulls fail to scale this level quickly, a drop to the 50-day SMA and below it to the support line of the channel is likely.We anticipate strong buying between the 50-day SMA and the support line of the channel. If this zone holds, we might suggest long positions with a close stop loss, kept just below the channel.However, if the bulls push the price back above 20-day EMA within the next couple of days, the BCH/USD pair can move up to $480. Presently, we do not find any reliable buy setup.Contrary to our expectation, EOS did not find any strong buying close to the 20-day EMA and the critical support of $6.8299. This is a bearish sign. Currently, the bulls are attempting to hold the 50-day SMA but the weak bounce suggests a lack of demand. A breakdown of the 50-day SMA can sink the digital currency to the support line of the ascending channel, below which, a drop to $4.4930 is probable.The 20-day EMA is turning down and the 50-day SMA is flattening out. The RSI is also back below 50, which suggests that the bears have a slight edge. Our view will be invalidated if the bulls quickly scale the overhead resistance of $6.8299 and sustain it. If that happens, the EOS/USD pair will again try to breakout of the channel. We will wait for the price to close (UTC time frame) above $6.8299 before suggesting any long positions.Litecoin (LTC) is attempting to hold the 20-day EMA. This is a positive sign. It shows buying on dips. If the price rebounds from the 20-day EMA, the bulls will again try to ascend the overhead resistance zone of $121.9018–$127.6180.On the other hand, if the bears sink the LTC/USD pair below the 20-day EMA, it can decline to $91. This is a strong support, which is likely to hold. The 20-day EMA is flat and the RSI is close to the midpoint. This suggests a range formation in the short term. The support of the range might be at $91 and resistance at $120. A breakdown of $91 will signal weakness and will attract further selling. Therefore, traders can maintain the stop loss on the remaining long position at $90.Binance Coin (BNB) has declined below the 20-day EMA, but the bulls are currently trying to reclaim the level. If successful, it can again move up to $36.But if the BNB/USD pair fails to sustain above the 20-day EMA, it can dip to the 50-day SMA. We expect strong buying close to this level. The bears have not sustained below the 50-day SMA throughout this year, barring the fall on May 9. This shows that buyers lap up the cryptocurrency on dips. Therefore, we will watch the price action at the 50-day SMA closely and propose long positions if we spot a bullish pattern.Bitcoin SV (BSV) continues to be in an uptrend. Both the moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is in the overbought zone. This shows that the bulls are in command. The first stop on the downside is $176.083, which is the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of the recent rally. But if this level cracks, the fall can extend to the 50% retracement level of $152.015.If the bulls arrest the pullback at $176.083, it will indicate strength and will increase the chances of a breakout above $254. If that happens, the BSV/USD pair can surge to $307.789 and above it to $340.248. Another possibility is that the pair enters into a range to consolidate the gains. We will propose a trade if we spot a setup that gives the traders a good risk-to-reward ratio.Stellar (XLM) has broken down of the 20-day EMA and is presently trying to stay above the 50-day SMA. The horizontal support of $0.11507853 is also located just below the 50-day SMA, hence, we anticipate the buyers to step in to defend this level.The flattish moving averages and RSI just below 50 suggests a balance between the bulls and the bears. If the XLM/USD pair rebounds off $0.11507853, it might rise to $0.14861760 and remain between these levels for a few days.If the pair plummets below $0.11507853, it will indicate an advantage to the bears and a drop to $0.08641170 is probable. We withdraw our existing trade suggestion and will again give a recommendation if we spot a reliable buy setup.Tron (TRX) turned down sharply after reaching our first target objective of $0.040. However, the price remains above the 20-day EMA, which is sloping up. This suggests that bulls have a minor advantage. If the 20-day EMA holds, we expect another attempt by the bulls to break out of $0.40.On the other hand, if the 20-day EMA gives way, the TRX/USD pair can plunge to $0.02815521. A break of this support will be a negative sign and can drag the price back toward $0.02094452. Traders who have long positions can lighten up closer to $0.040. Until then, stops can be maintained at the breakeven.Market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange."

Source: Diar, Vol. 3. Issue 10The rising share notably does not represent an all time high, which was at 24% in July 2018, according to Diar’s data. Moreover, the rising relative popularity of institutional products comes amid a backdrop of declining Bitcoin trading volumes in the U.S. context overall:U.S. exchange and institutional product Bitcoin trade volumes. Source: Diar, Vol. 3. Issue 10As Diar notes, CBOE has logically seen the biggest decline in market dominance, having delisted Bitcoin futures in mid-March of this year as it reassesses its approach to listing crypto derivative offerings.Diar further states that Grayscale's GBTC, which trades on the OTCMarkets, has reportedly also lost dominance. Having accounted for over 50% of the market share across the three institutional products, it now reportedly stands at under half, at 24%.As a context for its findings, Diar mentions a recent analysis from cryptocurrency index fund provider Bitwise Asset Management that argued that 95 percent of volume on unregulated exchanges appears to be fake or non-economic in nature.While suspicions in regard to reported volumes have frequently beset the industry, Bitwise’s data and claims were notably submitted to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission."

He proposed two interpretations of the index, writing that:“Good--> Since 2011, BMI >67 only seen during $BTC bull markets. More evidence bull starting. Bad --> BMI >67 after peak, $BTC falls ~25% = Profit taking ST.”In a further tweet in the same thread, the strategist argued that “the main takeaway is that BMI reaching 67 is further evidence the bear market for Bitcoin likely ended at $3,000.”As Cointelegraph has previously reported, Lee — a well-known Bitcoin bull — has used the BMI as a measure of investor sentiment as well as to assess Bitcoin’s price resilience and immediate prospects since he first launched the index in March 2018.Bitcoin is currently up half a percent on the day and is trading around $5,079 by press time, having hit a multi-month price high of over $5,420 earlier this week on April 10."

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.","Market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.The recent rally in bitcoin has turned around sentiment completely. Analysts are projecting a rally to new lifetime highs within the end of this year. Bitcoin Knowledge podcast host Trace Mayer has a target objective of $21,000 based on his analysis. That would entail a move of about 78.5% from the current levels. Though this number looks easily achievable, especially after the sharp up-move from the lows, as the price moves higher, we anticipate greater supply to hit the market. The people stuck at higher levels from the previous bull market will try to bail out of their positions and the traders who bought at lower levels will book profits. Hence, we expect a correction or consolidation in the markets soon.The number of people searching google for bitcoin has increased. However, the number is way below the peak hit during the previous bull market. This shows that people are beginning to notice it again but there is still no euphoria around it, which is a positive sign for the long term. Bitcoin (BTC) has been holding near $11,000 for the past two days, which is a positive sign. This shows that the bulls expect the rally to continue, hence, they are not booking profits in a hurry. If the price stays above the resistance line of the channel, we anticipate the uptrend to resume within a couple of days. Currently, both the moving averages are trending up and the RSI is in overbought territory, which suggests that bulls are in command.However, if the price dips back into the channel, the pullback can reach the 20-day EMA, which is a critical support. On a bounce off the 20-day EMA, we anticipate the bulls to again try to propel the price towards its target objective of $12,000. The BTC/USD pair will lose momentum if it drops below the 20-day EMA and the trend will weaken on a breakdown of the 50-day SMA. A breakdown of $7,413.46 will signal a deeper correction.Ether (ETH) came close to its target objective of $335 on June 22 and 23 but the bulls could not sustain the rise above $322.06, which shows profit booking at higher levels. However, the positive thing is that the cryptocurrency has not given up much ground. A consolidation between $280 and $322.06 indicates strength and increases the probability of a breakout above $322.06.If the ETH/USD pair closes (UTC time frame) above $322.06, it will complete a rounding bottom pattern that has a target objective of $563.48. However, we expect the pair to face stiff resistance near $480.Contrary to our assumption, if the pair fails to sustain above $322.06, it can drop to $280. The 20-day EMA is also located close to this level, hence, it is likely to act as a strong support, but if the support cracks, the cryptocurrency will lose momentum.Ripple (XRP) is retesting the breakout level of the symmetrical triangle. The previous resistance should now act as a strong support. If the price rebounds off this support, the bulls will again try to propel the price to $0.57259 and above it to $0.6250. Both the moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is in positive territory, which suggests that the bulls have the upper hand.Conversely, if the XRP/USD pair slips back into the triangle and breaks down of the 20-day EMA, it will signal weakness. Its next support is the 50-day SMA, below which a drop to $0.37835 is probable. For now, traders can retain the stop loss on the long position at $0.41. We will suggest to trail stops higher as the price moves northwards.Though Litecoin (LTC) closed above $140.3450 on June 22, it could not sustain the higher levels and quickly gave back its gains. Currently, the bulls are trying to hold it above the ascending channel. The previous resistance line of the channel should now work as a strong support. If the price rebounds off this support, the bulls will again try to push it towards its target objective of $158.91 and above it $184.7949.If the bulls fail to defend the support, the LTC/USD pair will re-enter the channel. It has strong support at the 20-day EMA. If this support holds, the bulls will again try to resume the uptrend, but if the support gives way, a drop to the 50-day SMA is possible. Hence, traders can protect their remaining long positions with a stop loss placed just below the 20-day EMA. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) remains in an uptrend. Both the moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is close to the overbought zone, which shows that the bulls are in command. The price rallied above the immediate resistance of $481.99 on June 22 but turned down from the resistance line of the channel. If the BCH/USD pair breaks out of the channel, it is likely to pick up momentum and rally to $639 and above it to $889. If the bulls fail to break out of the channel, the pair might dip back to the 20-day EMA. The digital currency will indicate a trend change if it breaks below both the moving averages and the support line of the channel.While EOS has sustained above the breakout level of $6.8299 for the past three days, it is struggling to move up. This shows a lack of demand at higher levels. Currently, it is back at $6.8299, which is an important support. The 20-day EMA is just above this level, hence, we anticipate buyers to defend this support.A strong rebound from $6.8299 can carry the EOS/USD pair it to the resistance line of the channel. If this level is scaled, the next level to watch is $8.6503. The moving averages are gradually sloping up and the RSI is just above the midpoint, which shows that the bulls have a slight advantage. Traders can retain the stop loss on the long position at $6.40.If the bears sink the pair below $6.8299, a drop to the 50-day SMA and below it at the support line of the channel is probable. If the bulls fail to defend the support line of the channel, the trend will turn negative and the price can plunge to $4.4930. Binance Coin (BNB) has been consolidating near the highs for the past few days. Though it broke out of the overhead resistance at $38.6463356, it could not sustain it. This shows profit booking at higher levels. Currently, the bulls are attempting to rebound from the 20-day EMA. If successful, we anticipate another attempt to rally to $46.1645899 and above it to $50.On the other hand, if the bulls fail to ascend the overhead resistance, the BNB/USD pair is likely to drop below the 20-day EMA and consolidate between $28 and $38.6463356 for the next few days. Therefore, traders can protect their long positions with a stop loss placed just below the 20-day EMA. The trend will turn bearish on a breakdown of $28.The bulls have held the price of Bitcoin SV (BSV) close to the highs, which is a positive sign. It shows a lack of selling near the resistance. The bears have not even been able to drag the price to the 20-day EMA. Both the moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is close to the overbought zone, which shows that bulls clearly have the advantage.If the price rebounds from the uptrend line and breaks out of $255.620, it will resume the up move that has a price target of $307.789 and above it $340.248. The probability of a breakout is high as long as the BSV/USD pair stays above the 20-day EMA. However, if the bears sink the price below the 20-day EMA, the momentum will weaken. In such a case, a range-bound action between $175 and $255.620 is likely. The trend will turn down if the price sustains below $175.Tron (TRX) has again entered the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. It has rallied sharply in the past two days and is close to the June 2 high of $0.04156575. If the price breaks out of the overhead resistance, a rally to  $0.05218328 is possible.Both the moving averages are gradually moving up and the RSI is in positive territory, which suggests that bulls have the upper hand. The TRX/USD pair has started a new uptrend after a long consolidation, hence, we anticipate the up-move to continue for some time. Our bullish view will be invalidated if the price reverses direction from the current levels and breaks down of the critical support of $0.02815521. Cardano (ADA) again broke out of the overhead resistance at $0.10 on June 23 but failed to sustain the higher levels. However, the positive thing is that it has held above the moving averages for the past few days. This shows buying on dips.  If the bulls break out and sustain the ADA/USD pair above $0.10, it will complete a reversal pattern that has a target objective of $0.22466773. The traders can wait for a close (UTC time frame) above $0.10 and buy as suggested in our earlier analysis.Our bullish view will be negated if the price fails to break out and sustain above $0.10. In such a case, it might remain range-bound between $0.076254 and $0.10 for a few days.Market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange."

with ...","May 28, 2019","On May 22, 2019, cryptocurrency mixers (also called tumblers) were front and center on the news cycle, following reports of European authorities shutting down one such service. Law enforcement officials involved said the action was necessitated by reports on Bestmixer.io — i.e., the platform in question that was being used to funnel dirty money via cryptocurrencies.","Stakeholders in the crypto industry decried the action, calling it a gross overreach by government agents. They also declared that it set a dangerous precedent, one that could be inimical to cryptography as a whole.In the wake of the shutdown, Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, suggested the creation of an on-chain mixing service. With the eyes of law enforcement seemingly fixed on anonymous cryptocurrency operations, a pivot toward on-chain anonymization might be the solution for those preferring to keep their cryptocurrency transactions anonymous.While it is common to hear phrases like “anonymous transactions” with respect to cryptocurrencies, the truth is that activities on many blockchains are more pseudonymous than anonymous. Cryptocurrency transactions proceed without the need for a third-party intermediary, and oftentimes, this feature gets conflated with actual anonymity.In mainstream finance, if person A wishes to send funds to person B, then A has to use a service — e.g., a bank to facilitate the transaction. The identity of both participants will be known to the third-party authenticator, and it could be provided to law enforcement, tax bodies or other government agencies.For cryptocurrency transactions, the absence of an intermediary means A and B can transact between themselves without revealing their identities. While this may seem like anonymity, it really isn’t, as their transaction is still visible to other participants with access to the blockchain.Now, let’s imagine a spy or some other “bad actor” — who really has it in for either A or B — using careful blockchain forensics: They can follow these transactions to uncover the real-life identities of the participants. These days, public addresses belonging to cryptocurrency exchanges and other major stakeholders are known to many in the community.This knowledge is one of the reasons why monitors can become aware of a hack even before platforms become aware of what is happening. A large transaction from a known wallet to an unknown wallet usually raises eyebrows.There have been numerous instances when the alphanumeric cryptocurrency addresses have been linked to their owners. Back in November 2018, Cointelegraph reported on the United States Treasury Department sanctioning a couple of Iranian nationals implicated in the SamSam bitcoin ransomware scheme.At the time, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the U.S. Treasury Department remarked that it was the first time that BTC addresses had been publicly attributed to individuals on its sanctions list.There are, of course, cryptocurrencies that offer near-total anonymity by obscuring almost every detail of a transaction — addresses, amounts involved, etc. Monero (XMR) and zcash (ZEC) are popular examples of these so-called “privacy coins.”These cryptocurrencies mostly utilize transaction mixers or high-anonymity consensus protocols, such as zero-knowledge proofs (zk-SNARKs), to create almost total obfuscation of transaction details. Zero-knowledge proofs enable transaction verification without needing to authenticate the validity of transactional information.Not everyone who values anonymity would necessarily want to use these privacy coins, and that is where cryptocurrency mixers come into play. These services obscure the source and destination of virtual currency transactions.As the name implies, mixers take the target transaction and include it in a basket of other transactions of the same value. The idea is that the “mixing” of these transactions would throw off any spy trying to “follow the money.”Tumblers aren’t only used for sending cryptocurrencies to other users, though. They can also be employed when trying to remain anonymous when receiving cryptocurrencies from platforms that utilize Know Your Customer (KYC) protocols, like trading services.For example, person C has made a total of 1 bitcoin (BTC) this past week: 0.5 BTC from trading, 0.3 BTC from her online store, and 0.2 BTC from working as a freelance writer. If C withdraws all 1 BTC to her bitcoin address, she could lose her anonymity because these transactions would be originating from platforms with robust KYC provisions.Person C could use a cryptocurrency tumbler to mix up these transactions by adding inputs from other users. At the end of the process, C receives her 1 BTC, but the information recorded on the blockchain would be sufficiently scattered to throw off any potential spy.Cryptocurrency mixing services employ numerous features to ensure privacy and anonymity. Users usually have to create “burner cryptocurrency addresses” (i.e., temporary wallets). These platforms do not store user information for more than 24 hours. The mixing process can last between 30 minutes and six hours. Longer time frames tend to produce more secure transactions.While there are several cryptocurrency mixing platforms, they usually employ the same process. Users specify their target addresses for receiving the “mixed coins,” then select a convenient time frame and agree to the fee, which typically ranges from 2-5%.In April 2019, Cointelegraph reported that mixed BTC transactions (“CoinJoins”) constituted about 4.09% of all bitcoin payments. Data from Long Hash — a blockchain analytics firm — showed that bitcoin payments via CoinJoins were up by more than 300% since August 2018.Privacy and anonymity aren’t usually concepts that go down well with governing bodies. Thus, it is no surprise that various jurisdictions have taken steps to curtail efforts for ensuring anonymity for cryptocurrency payments.Countries such as France and Japan have called for privacy coins like monero and dash (DASH) to be banned. In China, blockchain companies are forbidden from designing anonymity-enhancing features, with Beijing saying such regulation is healthy for the industry in the long run.Government officials usually put forward the same argument to justify their actions: Privacy coins enable criminals to launder money, evade taxes or sponsor terrorist organizations.As previously reported by Cointelegraph, various governments are stepping up their efforts to monitor blockchain transactions. Some of these jurisdictions are even turning to blockchain analysis specialists like Chainalysis to identify cryptocurrency hackers and tax evaders.Now, it appears that law enforcement agencies are turning their attention toward cryptocurrency tumblers. Recently, Europol, in conjunction with Dutch and Luxembourgian authorities, shut down Bestmixer.io — one of the largest cryptocurrency mixers in the industry, with a turnover of more than $200 million since its inception back in May 2018.According to the Europol report, the platform was involved in money laundering and several forms of illegal financing. The investigation reportedly began back in June 2018, with Europol planning to share the information gathered from the bust with several other law enforcement agencies in different jurisdictions.Once the news became public, several notable figures spoke out, including internet security guru and cryptocurrency bull John McAfee, who responded to the news via Twitter, saying:“Bitcoin mixers are now being targeted. Anonymity itself is slowly being considered a crime. The word ‘Privacy’ will soon mean ‘Criminal Intent.’”McAfee’s comment echoes those of many in the industry who accuse the government of conflating privacy with criminality. These critics argue that there are many noncriminal reasons why someone would wish to protect their privacy and anonymity while transacting in cryptocurrencies.Sjors Provoost, a bitcoin developer, quipped:Dutch law enforcement took down a mixer today and apparantly charged them with money laundering. I find this a very worrying precedent, because mixers are currently the only tool to mitigate Bitcoin's poor on chain privacy. This action puts lives at risk. https://t.co/fcxj9kMhysCryptocurrency-related robberies aren’t restricted to online hacks. There have been physical assaults on cryptocurrency owner, with some even leading to the death of the victim. From Dubai to Singapore, and even the United Kingdom, cryptocurrency owners have fallen victim to armed bandits looking to steal their valuable virtual coins.Many government agencies around the world argue that the use of cryptocurrency-anonymizing services akin to being involved in illegal activities. In many ways, it seems to be an extension of anti-cryptocurrency rhetoric by state officials in different jurisdictions.Cointelegraph reached out to Emin Gün Sirer associate professor of computer science at Cornell University and the co-director of the initiative for cryptocurrencies and smart contracts (IC3), to speak about the merits of such government action vis-à-vis the pervasiveness of money laundering via virtual currencies. According to the professor:“Money laundering is a problem for all bearer assets, starting with government-issued cash. Every society on earth has decided that the benefits of cash on hand outweigh the downsides of a small percentage of money laundering transactions. And they have enacted effective means for controlling these unwanted use cases at the edges of the financial system, where the banking system meets consumers.”Despite the continued assertion by state agents that cryptocurrencies find extensive use in criminal activities, the actual hard data available in the public domain shows the exact opposite. Earlier in the year, Japan’s National Police Agency (NPA) released its 2018 money laundering report, which showed virtual currency-related money laundering at less than 2% of all recorded cases.However, the Financial Services Agency (FSA) of Japan recently declared that it would increase its oversight of cryptocurrency exchanges to stamp out money laundering. With the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) visiting the country in the fall of 2019, Japan hopes to gain a favorable rating from the intergovernmental body.Perhaps the FSA could focus on the other avenues on which close to 99% of all money laundering in the country happen. Cryptocurrencies certainly didn’t contribute to the country receiving the FATF’s lowest rating in terms of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and KYC compliance back in 2008.If governments continue to clamp down on avenues that ensure transactional anonymity, then it stands to reason that developers will create more robust platforms that will be more difficult to police. Professor Sirer made similar remarks in his correspondence with Cointelegraph, writing:“The problem with shutting down a mixer/tumbler is that it will force the community to develop more effective tumblers and mixers that cannot be shut down or traced as easily.”One such example could be the pivot toward on-chain anonymization. Shortly after the Bestmixer.io shutdown, Ethereum’s Buterin proposed the creation of an on-chain ether (ETH) mixer as a way of improving user privacy on the blockchain.Buterin’s proposed ETH mixer goes beyond spreading transactions among multiple users, instead suggesting to completely obfuscate all transaction details by ensuring that they don’t appear on the blockchain. Buterin did, however, mention that such a system might only be able to handle small amounts of ETH.When asked about the viability of on-chain mixers, Sirer opined:“I doubt that either Bitcoin or Ethereum will add on-chain anonymity measures any time soon. Bitcoin is capacity limited and change-averse, while Ethereum is focused on building a world computer. But other coins will emerge with stronger guarantees, and there's plenty of research into bolt-on alternatives. By clamping down on a service that is easy to trace, law enforcement is setting the stage for another generation of services that they will not be able to control or corral.”Section 10 of the bitcoin white paper, as written by its creator Satoshi Nakamoto, focuses on privacy — i.e., the limiting of personal information of transacting parties. Privacy and anonymity are arguably fundamental tenets of cryptocurrency held by many enthusiasts. It doesn’t appear to be beyond the realms of comprehension to envision that developers will create censorship-resistant platforms that allow anonymous cryptocurrency transactions — if pushed to do so."

It is also uncorrelated to other asset classes, hence, it can act as a safe haven investment during an economic crisis.In Brazil, which is reeling under a slowdown and high unemployment rate, 1.5 million people are investing in cryptocurrencies compared to the local stock markets called B3, which has 1 million investors.However, history has shown that if traders do not book profits or protect their paper profits, all their gains can vanish and bury the traders in huge losses. Therefore, do not chase prices higher and do not get overly greedy.Russia, which had banned crypto assets as a means of payment in May of last year is considering allowing cryptocurrency trading.Cryptocurrencies and blockchain are not only about making money. The technology is increasingly being used in various fields, including charity, to improve productivity and bring greater transparency.Neo (NEO) was the best performer among major cryptocurrencies in the past seven days. The official Twitter page reported a fake website misleading token holders on the pretext of NEO 3.0 token swap. Can the digital currency pick up momentum and play catch up with other altcoins? Let us find out.The NEO/USD pair has scaled above both moving averages, which are on the verge of a bullish crossover. This is a positive sign and indicates advantage to the bulls. The up move might face selling in $20–$25 zone. Hence, a couple of weeks of consolidation or a minor correction cannot be ruled out.However, if the sentiment remains positive, we anticipate the bulls to eventually push the price above $25, which is likely to start a new uptrend. The next target to watch on the upside is $42.Our bullish view will be invalidated if the pair struggles to ascend the overhead resistance zone. In such a case, a few weeks of consolidation cannot be ruled out. The support on the downside is closer to $11.Monero (XMR) was the second-best performer in the past seven days as it rallied about 20%. Currently, the community is focused on the first-ever Monero Konferenco on June 22 and 23. Could the price react positively to the events and continue its up-move in the coming weeks? Let’s analyze.The XMR/USD pair has continued to move up smartly for the past two weeks. It can now rise to $150. This level had acted as a major roadblock between June and September of last year.However, the moving averages are on the verge of a bullish crossover and the RSI is close to the overbought zone, which indicates that bulls have the upper hand. They are likely to attempt to ascend $150. If successful, the pair might start a new uptrend that can carry it to $299, with minor resistance at $218.833 that is likely to be crossed.Conversely, if the bears defend $150, it might remain range bound between $81.167 and $150 for a few weeks. Our bullish view will be invalidated if the price turns around and plummets below $81.Bitcoin (BTC) has continued its momentum in the past week that has forced players sitting on the sidelines to jump in. As a result, bitcoin’s price surged from $10,000 to $11,000 within 24 hours.Not only the price has moved up; bitcoin’s hash rate also rose to a new high during the week. The open interest in bitcoin futures on CME hit a new high, which shows increased institutional interest. To cater to this higher demand, Galaxy Digital will introduce crypto options trading, which can be used by larger players for hedging purposes.After the recent price action, Fundstrat Global Advisors co-founder Tom Lee said that bitcoin can easily hit new lifetime highs. Not only analysts, traders and bitcoin enthusiasts are positive on the cryptocurrency; Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said that he was positive on bitcoin as a store of value and is long on it.Within two weeks, the BTC/USD pair skyrocketed from $7,513.79 to $11,165.69. That is a rally of 48.60% within a short span of time. The 20-week EMA is sloping up and the RSI is in overbought territory, which suggests that the bulls have the upper hand.The pair is now likely to move up to $12,000 which is a critical resistance. Previously, this level had repeatedly posed a stiff challenge for the bulls. After such a sharp up move, we anticipate the digital currency to enter a minor pullback or a consolidation closer to $12,000.Any dip will find support at $10,000 but if this level breaks, the cryptocurrency will re-enter the ascending channel. It will signal a deeper correction if it breaks down of this channel.Contrary to our assumption, if the cryptocurrency breaks out of $12,000, it can spike to $16,000, but we give this a very low probability of occurring in the short term.Leading cryptocurrency exchange Binance announced a bitcoin-pegged token on its blockchain Binance Chain that will be 100% backed by bitcoin. It will be available to trade both on Binance and its decentralized exchange Binance DEX.A report by Binance Research claimed that Facebook’s Libra stablecoin can boost cryptocurrency volume because it is likely to generate interest from both institutional and retail players.Most institutional players expect bitcoin to maintain its supremacy in 2019, according to a survey of institutional and VIP clients of Binance. However, the survey shows that respondents did not consider the crypto foray of Facebook, Samsung or JPMorgan Chase as the future drivers of the asset class. With consistently improving fundamentals, can binance coin (BNB) extend its up move? Let us find out.The BNB/USD pair is one of the strongest major cryptocurrencies as it continues to make new lifetime highs on a regular basis. This shows that the market participants are positive that the uptrend will continue. The 20-week EMA is sloping up and the RSI is in the overbought zone, which suggests that bulls are in command. If the bulls scale and sustain above $38.6463356, a rally to $46.1645899 and above it to $56.0786952 is probable.On the other hand, if the bears defend the overhead resistance, a few weeks of range bound action between $28 and $38.6463356 is possible. A minor correction or a few weeks of consolidation will be a healthy sign.Our bullish view will be invalidated if the bears sink the pair below $28 and the 20-week EMA. In such a case, a deeper correction can be expected.Grayscale Investments launched OTC trading in Ethereum-based security Grayscale Ethereum Trust last week. This gives an opportunity to the traders to invest in ethereum (ETH) without actually holding the cryptocurrency. Can the largest altcoin by market capitalization extend its up-move or is it time for a correction to set in?The ETH/USD pair is knocking on the doors of the overhead resistance at $322.06. The moving averages are close to completing a bullish crossover and the RSI is near the overbought level, which indicates a trend change.A breakout and close above $322.06 can propel the price to $480 as there are no major resistance levels in between.On the other hand, if the bulls fail to push the price above $322.06, it might remain range-bound between $225.39 and $322.06 for a few days. The trend will turn down if the bears sink the pair below the critical support of $225.39 and the moving averages.The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange."

A spokesperson for Wright had told the Financial Times (FT) this week that the office was the first government agency to recognize Wright as the creator of the leading digital currency, a claim that has been met with skepticism by the cryptocurrency community. However, the office told the FT that it does not investigate whether there is a connection between a claimant and a pseudonymous author, and that registering the source code does not protect the intellectual property of bitcoin as an invention.Cryptocurrency research firm Diar reported this week that the market capitalization for USD stablecoins has hit all-time highs, exceeding $4 billion. The data shows specifically that stablecoins have a market cap of around $4.3 billion, revealing a surge in USD stablecoin trading volumes in regard to the USDC’s 130% uptick between April and May, as well as TrustToken's TrueUSD $3.8 billion in volume in May. Controversial stablecoin tether still remains in the lead, the report notes, with trading volumes this year to date exceeding $1.3 trillion — already $200 million higher than the whole of 2018. However, Diar additionally states in the report that the overall broad use case of stablecoins has been slow to gain traction.Stablecoin issuer Tether said this week in a court filing that it had invested some of its reserves in BTC. According to the documents, an attorney for Tether’s associated firm Bitfinex stated that Tether had invested “a small amount” of Tether’s reserves into bitcoin, specifying that “prior to the April 24th order […] Tether actually did invest in instruments beyond cash and cash equivalents, including bitcoin,” and adding that Tether made “other investments, including purchasing other assets.” As a response to the admission, the judge in charge of the ongoing investigation into whether Bitfinex secretly used Tether reserves to cover a $850 million loss doubted the logic of investing a stablecoin in a volatile asset like bitcoin.The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) delayed its decision again concerning the VanEck bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) proposal. The SEC has added a 35-day period for gathering more information and opinions on the proposal, which was originally filed by CBOE last year. In this week’s SEC filing, the organization listed 14 questions about the proposal for the public to review and answer, with the idea of using the answers to help them decide about approval. The questions are related to the ability to protect investors and public interest from fraud and similar exploitations. The organization had already delayed its decision on the Securities Act update proposal that would allow bitcoin ETFs to be traded on CBOE.U.S. telecom and media giant AT&T announced this week that it would accept cryptocurrency for paying phone bills online using crypto payments platform BitPay. BitPay converts crypto into fiat and is currently used by more than 20,000 businesses. AT&T had previously announced at the end of 2018 that it was working on a suite of blockchain solutions compatible with Microsoft Azure and the IBM Blockchain Platform. This week’s reveal about its crypto acceptance is reportedly the first time that a U.S.-based business in the wireless network industry will enable bill payments with BitPay.The crypto markets are seeing some calm at the end of the week, with bitcoin trading slightly below $8,000, ether at $250 and XRP at $0.38.The top three altcoin gainers of the week are brother, emaratcoin and compound coin.

Speaking to CNBC, NYMEX’s Grisant said that bitcoin will go back to $7,000 for a short period of time, and that the market will then consolidate: “I think it consolidate a little bit. [...] I think consolidation for this market is very healthy.” Grisant also noted that volumes have come back down over the past few sessions, an indication that buyers are not returning to the market with the same strength they were a few weeks prior.This week, two miners reportedly executed a 51% attack on the bitcoin cash (BCH) blockchain. While 51% attacks are normally assumed to be carried out with malicious intent, this case occurred when two mining pools attempted to prevent an unidentified party from taking some coins that — due to a code update — were essentially “up for grabs.” The two miners, with majority network control — BTC.top and BTC.com — carried out the attack in order to prevent an unknown miner from taking coins that were sent to an “anyone can spend” address following the original hard fork in May 2017. According to statistics on Coin.Dance, BTC.top and BTC.com control 43% of the bitcoin cash mining pool.The United Kingdom’s financial regulator released a report this week that cryptocurrency investors in the country have lost more than $34 million due to crypto and forex scams from 2018 to 2019. The regulator gathered data from the U.K. national fraud and cybercrime reporting center, Action Fraud, finding the individual losses due to scams had decreased from $76,000 to $18,500, while total losses fell by $14 million. However, the report noted that the number of times scams were reported had overall tripled, with 81% of the reports related to cryptocurrency scam claims. The U.K. regulator also noted that scammers tended to use social media to find potential investors, often using pictures of celebrities with fake endorsements.Cryptocurrency mixing service Bestmixer.io has been shut down this week by Dutch, Luxembourg and Europol authorities. Cryptocurrency tumblers are tools that allow crypto transactions of nonprivate coins to become more private by mixing crypto funds with others in order to obscure the funds’ original source. Bestmixer.io has had a reported turnover of more than $200 million since its launch in May 2018, and mixed cryptocurrencies including bitcoin (BTC), litecoin (LTC), bitcoin cash (BCH) and others. The investigation that preempted the shutdown began in June 2018, as the authorities found that a large number of the mixed coins had been used in money laundering.The U.S. SEC has again delayed a decision on approving or disproving a blockchain exchange-traded fund.

Perhaps, the largest ones are the forks of bitcoin (BTC), bitcoin cash (BCH) and the Ethereum (ETH) network. As a rule, the reason lies in disagreements related to the philosophy of the project, its development or financial components.","Various views on how the platform should be managed led to the conflict of interest at the headquarters of MakerDAO. It all started with the fact that Andy Milenius, the company’s chief technology officer, left the project, as reported by Cointelegraph on April 28. Internal conflicts have been aggravated by the recently found vulnerability and trials between the key members. How far can it go and will we witness another fundamental split in the blockchain company?MakerDAO is the preeminent lending platform for the DAI stablecoin — which is dollar-pegged, no less. The MakerDAO project is also a decentralized governance platform. It is through the MakerDAO platform that MKR token holders vote for the execution of changes in the DAI lending protocol. In essence, the platform’s governance system works on the principle of granting several proposals encoded in the form of Ethereum addresses. Users vote for the proposals of their choice by freezing MKR tokens in the voting contract as pledges.Between April 22 and 26, a critical vulnerability was discovered and analyzed on the MakerDAO platform by the security audit firm Zeppelin. The vulnerability impacted the very functioning of MakerDAO by making user funds irretrievable. By exploiting the system’s vulnerable coding, attackers could gain access to the system and freely move the tokens staked in favor of one MakerDAO governance proposal to another — perhaps even a competing proposal — and lock them in place forever. On May 6, the MakerDAO team released an appeal to its community on Reddit:“In partnership with Coinbase and Zeppelin, the Maker Foundation has been participating in a second round of audits of the Maker Voting Contract. During this process, we discovered the need to make a critical update. [...] You are advised to move your MKR out of the old contract and back into your personal wallet immediately.”What could have seemed as a routine error in code at the inception of MakerDAO turned out to be much more as the plot thickened with the sudden departure of Andy Milenius, the project’s CTO, in early April. His departure was preceded by a voluminous 24 page-long letter published on April 3, which begins with the words, “Currently, the Maker development team is going through its most difficult challenge that I have witnessed during my 3.5 years with the project.”In his letter Milenius outlined his long-standing conflict with MakerDAO CEO Rune Christensen and the former’s attempts to usurp the platform, which began back to January 2017:“He [Christensen] told me it was necessary that he have full unilateral control over the Dev Fund from that point forward.”As stated by Milenius, though later Rune abandoned this idea, the whole situation led to the creation of the opposition, aimed at preventing Rune from ruining the project and at protecting the community’s funds.Another event that affected the professional relations inside the company, according to Milenius, was the appearance of Matt Richards, who, in the spring of 2017, assumed the responsibility of the chief operating officer. According to Milenius, Richards was not only not familiar with the technical side of the project, but did not support the very idea of DappHub, the separate project led by the MakerDAO developers and initiated by Christensen to better manage the company’s processes. In addition, his invasion of the project interfered with the work of designers and developers, which soon led to internal conflicts and affected the platform’s development:“Matt especially hated the concept of DappHub. He thought it was an unprofessional arrangement and also seemed to feel personally insulted that they wanted to remain an entity separate from the organization he was trying to create. He would ask me countless times to explain to him why they felt culturally distinct from him and why couldn’t they just be a part of the “family” he so desperately wanted us to be. [...] I had told the DappHub developers to let me handle the business of dealing with Maker because I knew they would only get stressed out by Matt. This advice ended up being a huge mistake, as the core dev team was not around to object to the organizational decisions he was making until it was far too late.”As the situation got worse, Milenius requested Christensen to fire Richards:“I told him that Matt was consistently a distraction and wasted my time by proposing stupid ideas that needed constant rebuttal. I told him Matt’s opinion that the core developers were ‘my developers’ was preposterous and that I refused to control them and get them to ‘report’ to me like he wanted. I told him that Matt had done a lot of good for the project but that it was time for him to go.”However, even with Richards’s departure, the atmosphere inside the company did not improve. According to Milenius, Christensen was dissatisfied with the work of key developers — and they, in turn, tried to resist his attempts to monopolize the developers fund and spend all the money on his strategic initiatives.“They [the developers] said it was unfair that Rune gets to spend the entire Dev fund on his strategic initiatives. [...] They said Rune shouldn’t be able to monopolize access to the Dev fund like that because he isn’t a god and other people might have differing points of view or priorities.”As the conflict inside the company smouldered further and involved new people, more and more people began to disagree with the way Christensen tried to take control of the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), with the result that the main project developers from DappHub stopped cooperating. As stated by Milenius, his ideas of equal working space and democratization inherent in DAO, and the desire of his fellow executives to traditional corporate efficiency hadn’t been accepted by Christensen. Later, Milenius confirmed to the media that he is no longer the technical director of MakerDAO.“The purpose of the Maker Foundation was to formalize existing social relations in the Maker community. It is currently failing at this purpose and needs to be corrected at the fundamental level.”The charade of departures from the company’s board has so far been focused on preventing the consolidation of power in the hands of Christensen. When the company’s infrastructure expanded and disagreements began to arise, Christensen offered the developers two options for cooperation: the Red Pill and the Blue Pill.Those who chose Red Pill were supposed to work for him inside the Maker Ecosystem Growth Group (MEGG) on the initiatives that “he was going to eventually document in the much-promised Strategic Plan.” The tasks were aimed at delivering government compliance and integrating Maker into the existing global financial system. The Blue Pill was prepared for those who didn’t want to work on those initiatives. Their primary duty was the implementation of Multi-Collateral DAI (MCD) core contracts needed to launch a fully autonomous system, after which their relationships with the company would cease.According to Milenius, nobody accepted those binary options since they conflicted with the main idea of the decentralized company. General discontent led to the creation of an opposition group that called itself the Purple Pill in March 2018. Members include former MakerDAO business development executive Ashleigh Schap, who proclaimed that they aimed to make the company more decentralized. Schap, who has allegedly created the group, is now suing MakerDAO in a $1 million lawsuit.The real aim of the pseudo-Matrix saga, Blue and Red Pill amalgamation in the form of the Purple Pill faction was to dethorne Christensen and take control of the $200 million fund. So far, Purple Pill has been brewing its plots and accusations in the Signal chat with former members of the team:“The name Purple Pill was chosen because the hope was that there was a third way available to break up this binary choice. They thought this was an earnest attempt to add resiliency to the overall Strategic Plan.”In his letter, Milenius claims that many people, including board members, were added in the group after they agreed that the third way was desirable. At the same time, the creators and participants of the group pursued exclusively positive goals, wishing to save the organization and prevent the consolidation of funds in the hands of one person:“No one thought about the fact that they were board members, they just wanted to talk because these were some of the most senior and respected contributors in the project.”As the Purple Pill group was growing, tension was also rising on the Foundation Board. Christensen requested a large amount of MKR tokens from the Foundation Board for allegedly funding and expanding operations. When the members asked for more transparency and requested documents that could confirm his demands, he was surprised. This event could also become the reason why he later accused board members of conspiracy, when he found out there was a Signal group:“He couldn’t believe that people would treat him this way when he had broken his back working day and night for this project, sacrificing his own personal happiness and health like so many other entrepreneurs do. He had been under so much pressure for so long trying so hard to make this work that when he discovered the group, he snapped. Conspiracy. Corruption.”As a result, some board members who participated in the Purple Pill group were fired.MakerDAO has seen its fair share of woes, and they were only aggravated when five of the nine board members requested the Campbells law firm for assistance after they had been forced by Christensen to leave the company.David Currin, Denis Erfurt, Thomas Pulber, James Reidy and Kenny Rowe wrote a collective letter in an effort to contest the accusation made by Christensen and to prove their innocence. The expansive letter contains their collective confession that all five had been doing their jobs, a denial of conspiracy against the foundation’s management and statements about sullied reputations.The letter also refers to the Purple Pill affair. All five claim that the discussions were neither conspiratorial nor clandestine, and involved a large group of people engaged in the project in various capacities, exploring ideas with a shared goal of protecting and advancing the project.The letter reveals that on March 22, 2019, the general counsel at MakerDAO, Brian Avello, contacted the five former board members via email with a request to attend a meeting regarding “urgent things on the regulatory front.” The meeting was a pretext for the CEO to confront the five regarding the Purple Pill group and demand that they either resign voluntarily or be removed as directors of the foundation.The accusations thrown at the five by Christensen were quite weighty, ranging from conspiracy to corruption, placing the project at risk and scheming to breach their duties.While none of the five case participants replied to a request for a comment, it remains to be seen how the drama with legal action will unfold.On April 27, Richards published an answer to Milenius’s accusations in a Reddit thread — thus, providing a chance to address the story from a different angle. In particular, he acknowledged the mistakes he made while working as the MakerDAO COO and noted that, relying on the fact that all members of the company were acting out of good intentions, he did not take into account the growing disagreements of the staff of MakerDAO, instead of working under a single aegis.Richards also referred to Milenius as the person who was mainly interested in technical nuances and coding, rather than in the project’s development:“According to Andy, no amount of accountability was acceptable, the efficiency that came with explicit hierarchy did not outweigh how uncool or unfair it was, MKR investors interests were of little consequence, the dev fund was for “hacker aesthetics, development tools, Free Software, grassroots empowerment, memetics, the Unix Design philosophy and especially the political implications of decentralized technology. [...] And if Maker’s vision was built as a by-product, cool.”Being less eloquent than Milenius, Richards ended his post with optimistic forecasts about the future of MakerDAO:“I am hopeful about the future of this project and believe it will likely be better off without Andy.”The situation may look intriguing if viewed from the point of those truly affected by the scandal and the system vulnerabilities — the MakerDAO community, namely because it is their money at stake. The multiple comments left by Reddit users under Richard’s letter are examples of irony and emotional upheaval. The community’s reaction is best described by a comment left by a user nicknamed “ShiIl,” who stated:“Like the Greek dramas of old, there is no real bad guy here, just people doing their best with varying motivations.”Other users referred to the idea of decentralization and pointed out that, in such corporations, the control shouldn’t be accessed by only one person:“The whole point of this thing is to avoid trusting one individual! Even if Rune is a saint, the whole point is can't be evil not don't be evil.”Meanwhile, there are some users who found nothing unusual in the situation:“This seems like a rather typical situation of a CEO trying to run a business and deliver value to investors while the CTO constantly gets distracted by ‘cool’ features which don't drive revenue. It's a common issue in many companies and generally the result of having a CTO who is technically skilled but lacks business acumen. Such people should not be given leadership positions in a technical team. The goal of the CTO is to build the tech the company needs, not the tech they want.”The biggest risk thus far is the vulnerability found in the system, since it could be only a matter of time before someone, somewhere tries to take advantage of it. The company has already announced that it has developed a fix together with Zeppelin and the implementation of it was underway. But the internal power struggle within the company remains the most worrying aspect of the entire conundrum surrounding MakerDAO. If the team continues the conflict, then these issues may soon eclipse any of the technical difficulties the company has — and the community may have the last say on the matter."

The outlet had previously posted a note that a recent Google Core Update had led to a more than 70% visibility drop on mobile overnight, leading the organization to decide to shut down rather than downsize. However, an update this week from CCN Markets Director Jonas Borchgrevink notes that, for an unexplained reason, the crypto outlet’s old domain name, CryptoCoinNews, has been showing up with new 2019 articles on Google, leading the team to decide to keep working. Theories about the visibility drop, which affected other news outlets, have ranged from it being a block of clickbait titles or a ban on conservative outlets by an allegedly “liberal” Google.","United States residents who use major crypto exchange Binance will lose trading option access for many cryptocurrencies when the exchange puts into action its updated terms of service this September. As reported this week, Binance updated its terms of service to include trading on the platform for U.S. residents, a change that comes shortly after its announcement of a U.S.-exclusive fiat-to-crypto exchange. According to a table created by CryptoPotato, there are a number of cryptos that will no longer have a trading outlet in the U.S., as well as several tokens that will be listed on only one exchange after Binance closes for U.S. residents. However, veteran cryptocurrencies — including XRP, DASH, XLM, ETC and ZRX — will still be listed on four or more other U.S. exchanges.The announcement this week from crypto exchange platform Liquid that it would be offering encrypted messenger Telegram’s token, gram, in a sale is not officially connected with Telegram, according to a source close to the messaging app. As Cointelegraph had reported earlier this week, Liquid had said that it would be the representative of gram tokens for Gram Asia, which it called the largest holder of the token in Asia. However, in comments to Cointelegraph, a source close to Telegram noted that it was the first time that it had heard of Gram Asia. In separate comments, an investor in Telegram’s token told Cointelegraph that no one has rights to sell the tokens before its official launch. Liquid CEO Mike Kayamori told Cointelegraph that the public sale is the result of an exclusive agreement between Liquid and Gram Asia, without the direct involvement of Telegram.According to a new report published in the journal Joule, the carbon emissions generated by bitcoin (BTC) are comparable to the whole of Kansas City. According to Christian Stoll, one of the project’s researchers, the energy consumption used in mining the largest cryptocurrency is only growing, noting that the computing power needed to solve a BTC puzzle has more than quadrupled since last year. The study was based on data from IPO filings and IP addresses of some of the largest mining companies, finding that bitcoin is placed around Jordan and Sri Lanka — in international terms — due to its annual emissions of CO2, estimated to be between 22 and 22.9 megatons.According to a report from The Block, Facebook has reportedly secured support from dozens of players in the cryptocurrency and blockchain sector for its upcoming, secretive digital currency. The Wall Street Journal had reported earlier this week that Facebook had allegedly received the backing of $10 million each from firms — including Visa, Mastercard, PayPal and Uber — for the project, dubbed “Libra.” The Block cited further materials, noting that the project’s investors also include venture capital firms Andreessen Horowitz and Union Square Ventures, cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase and nonprofit organizations including Mercy Corps. According to a source speaking to The Block, the company aims to gather 100 members in the governing consortium, with a total planned for $1 billion, including all participants.The crypto markets have seen a slight uptick at the beginning of the week, with bitcoin trading at $9,054, ether at $269.54 and XRP at $.41.

The blockchain firm had raised over $13 million in a series of private rounds in 2018, with investors including China-based capital firm Fenbushi Capital. Dispatch Labs’ total remaining investment has since dropped to around $6.5 million, with CEO Matt McGraw reporting noting that the company did not have sufficient over-the-counter availability to liquidate digital currency that could have staved off the threat driven by the market downturn. However, McGraw added that the company has enough working capital to last through the year, taking into consideration the tentative market recovery.Cybersecurity firm Trend Micro confirmed this week that attackers have been exploiting a vulnerability in the Oracle WebLogic server to install monero (XMR) mining malware. The malware uses certificate files as an obfuscation trick to carry out cryptojacking, a process wherein malware uses a computer’s operating processing power to mine for cryptos without the owner’s consent or knowledge. According to Trend Micro, a security patch for the Oracle WebLogic vulnerability had been released in the national vulnerability database earlier this spring. The report also includes a recommendation for firms using that server to update their software to the latest version with the security patch in order to mitigate the risk of cryptojacking.Cryptocurrency exchange Bittrex said this week that it would block its U.S.-based users from trading in 30 cryptocurrencies. According to the announcement, after June 21, American traders will be unable to access a list of coins traded on the exchange, including QTUM and STORJ. Bittrex noted that U.S. users will receive an email with explanations behind what they are and are not allowed to do with the aforementioned assets, included selling them for assets that will stay available to them, canceling orders and moving them off the exchange. Once the ban comes into effect, U.S. users will not be able to buy or sell the select coins, and all open orders involving those coins will be cancelled. However, the coins will be transitioned to the Bittrex International platform.Cointelegraph takes a look at the types of special economic zones for cryptocurrencies around the world: to some Russian spaces, which seemed to have paused development, to Switzerland’s Crypto Valley, which is not technically a special economic zone, despite its name.Instant messaging service Telegram and its Telegram Open Network (TON) blockchain have been surrounded in relative secrecy since the project raised $1.7 billion last year.

He makes a point to distinguish stablecoins from cryptocurrency tokens at large, however, saying that stablecoins “are quite different from speculative assets like bitcoins, and more promising.”Villeroy has been an outspoken critic of bitcoin in particular, notably making the following statement at a 2017 conference in Beijing, China:“We need to be clear: Bitcoin is in no way a currency or even a cryptocurrency. It is a speculative asset. Its value and extreme volatility have no economic basis, and they are nobody’s responsibility. The Bank of France reminds those investing in bitcoin that they do so entirely at their own risk.”Mario Draghi, the President of the European Central Bank (ECB) — of which Villeroy is a governing council member — has recently echoed these sentiments, saying that cryptocurrency is not a currency, but rather a risky asset. Draghi points to the lack of backing for tokens such as bitcoin, rhetorically asking, “Who is behind the cryptocurrencies?”Unlike bitcoin, stablecoins are designed such that their value is always tied directly to some asset, such as gold, or are stabilized by an algorithm. A number of stablecoins have their value pegged to fiat currencies, such as TrustTokens’ line of fiat-backed coins, which include TrueUSD (U.S. dollars), TrueGBP (British pounds), TrueAUD (Australian dollars) and TrueCAD (Canadian dollars)."

Sherman said that lawmakers must act preemptively to impede the threat posed by cryptocurrencies and thus outlaw their purchase by American citizens. Crypto’s threat, he claimed, forebodes no less than a shake-up of America’s geopolitical influence due to its potential diminishing of the power of its sovereign currency:“An awful lot of our international power stems from the fact that the dollar is the standard unit of international finance and transactions [...] it is the announced purpose of the supporters of cryptocurrencies to take that power away from us.”To illustrate the dollar’s current hegemony, Sherman noted that in many key global markets such as oil, clearing via the New York Federal Reserve remains critical for major transactions.  The congressman continued to outline the purportedly negative impact of cryptocurrencies should they gain traction as a global unit of value, stating that an extra-national, distributed digital currency would:“Put us in the position where the significant sanctions we have on Iran, for example, would become irrelevant.”Sherman concluded by claiming that the end result of cryptocurrencies would be not only to disempower U.S. foreign policy, but also the country’s tax collection and traditional law enforcement — and thus to utterly transform both the domestic and the global status quo.As reported, Sherman has previously called for a prohibition on U.S. citizens buying or mining cryptocurrencies. He has also remarked of the supporters of initial coin offerings that “charlatans and scammers have always favored decentralized new enterprises.”In March 2018, he claimed that cryptocurrencies are a crock whose value lies in aiding terrorists and criminals.Many of Sherman’s fellow lawmakers, however, take a distinctly more positive view of the promise of cryptocurrencies, with Congressman Darren Soto working on the advancement of three interrelated bills involving the promotion of blockchain."

This shows that interest in cryptocurrencies is still high. If prices recover, a large number of traders sitting on the sidelines will jump onto the crypto bandwagon.Though the rebound is a bullish sign, for it to be sustainable, Bitcoin needs to gain a wider adoption in day to day transactions. Andreas Antonopoulos, Bitcoin educator and entrepreneur, believes that the next generation of use cases will highlight the need of Bitcoin to the average customer. Bitcoin is currently limited only to the tech-savvy users due to the difficulty in transaction and storage. But with advances, it is likely to reach the masses that will increase its popularity.In a report, software startup DataLight said that if Bitcoin continues to grow exponentially, the way it has in the past decade, then it will surpass the current leaders Visa, Master Card, and pay pal. While fundamentals determine the price in the long-term, short-term price is influenced by sentiment. Let’s analyze it with the help of charts.  BTC/USDWe had been projecting a target objective of $5,273.91 on Bitcoin (BTC) for the past few days and on Apr. 02, it hit an intraday high of $5,273.35. However, the higher levels saw profit booking that dragged the price back towards the support of $4,914.11. On the downside, $4,775 provided support, which is a positive sign. This shows that the bulls are in no great urgency to book profits.The BTC/USD pair is again attempting to resume the up move. If it scales above $5,273.35, a quick rally to $5,674 and above it to $5,900 is possible. Therefore, we had recommended to book only partial profits in our previous analysis. However, with the RSI deep in the overbought territory, the pair might spend some more time in consolidation close to the current levels.Our bullish view will be invalidated if the digital currency turns down from the current levels and slides below $4,500. Therefore, traders can raise the stops on the remaining long positions to $4,400.ETH/USDEthereum (ETH) could not close (UTC time frame) above $167.32 on Apr. 03. This shows selling at higher levels. However, the pullback found support close to $150 levels.  Currently, the bulls are again attempting to scale above the resistance of $167.32. If successful, the ETH/USD pair will complete a bullish ascending triangle pattern that has a target objective of $251.64.Contrary to our assumption, if the digital currency reverses direction from the current levels and plummets below $144.78, it can fall to the trendline of the ascending triangle. Traders can trail the stop loss on the remaining long position to $150.XRP/USDAs expected, Ripple (XRP) pulled back to the breakout level on Apr. 02 and 03, which held. This is a positive sign. Currently, the price has bounced off the support and is on its way towards the first target objective of $0.40.If the price sustains above the resistance line of the channel, it will signal the end of the downtrend. In the medium-term, the XRP/USD pair is likely to reach $0.60. Our bullish view will be invalidated if the pair slumps back below $0.33108. It will indicate a lack of demand at higher levels. We shall wait for the price to sustain above the channel for a couple of days before recommending any long positions.LTC/USDLitecoin (LTC) broke out of the overhead resistance at $91 on Apr. 03 but faced profit booking close to $100 levels. We expect $91 to act as a stiff resistance. The RSI had risen deep into the overbought territory, hence, we had proposed traders close their complete long positions in the previous analysis.The pullback in the LTC/USD pair took support at $80.4193 and is currently again trying to breakout of $91. If the pair breaks out and sustains above $91, it will be on target to reach $159. Nevertheless, if the bears defend the overhead resistance, a fall to $77 is probable. We shall wait for another buy setup to form before suggesting long positions once again.BCH/USDBitcoin Cash (BCH) soared to $363.30 level on Apr. 03, coming close to our target objective of $400. But higher levels attracted profit booking and the digital currency has given up some of its recent gains since then.After rallying 117.57 percent in two days, the BCH/USD pair might consolidate or correct for a few days before attempting to rise to $400 once again. Support on the downside is at $265.14 and $241.97, being 50 percent and 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement levels of the recent rally.If the bears sink the price below $239, a fall to $208.99 and below it a full 100 percent retracement to $166.98 is probable. Therefore, traders can trail the stop loss on the remaining long positions to $230.EOS/USDEOS reached our target objective of $5.8370 on Apr. 03 but it could not sustain the higher levels. The ensuing pullback found support at $4.90. Currently, the bulls are again attempting to push the price back above $6 and towards the next target objective of $6.8299. The moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is in the overbought zone, which shows that the bulls are in the driver’s seat.On the downside, any pullback might find support close to $4.4930, which is the previous resistance turned support. The 20-day EMA is also located just below this level. Hence, we expect the buyers to defend this level with force. If the level holds, the EOS/USD pair might remain range bound between $4.49 to $6.8299 for a few more days. But if this level breaks, it will indicate weakness. Traders can trail the stops on the remaining long positions to $4.8. We suggest tightening the stop loss to protect our paper profits.BNB/USDBinance Coin (BNB) is consolidating above $18 for the past two days, which is a positive sign. After the range expansion on Apr. 02, the range has shrunk for the past two days. The digital currency is taking a break after its stupendous run in the past few days.If the bulls scale above the overhead resistance at $22, a retest of the lifetime highs at $26.4732350 will be on the cards. The digital currency remains in a strong uptrend with both the moving averages sloping up and the RSI close to the overbought levels. Traders can continue to trail the stops on the remaining long positions to just below the 20-day EMA.The BNB/USD pair is currently trading inside the ascending channel. A breakdown of the channel and the 20-day EMA will be the first indication that the momentum is losing steam. A break below Apr. 02 intraday low of $15.5624721 can attract further selling and drag the price to the 50-day SMA. If this level also breaks, the trend will turn in favor of the bears.XLM/USDStellar (XLM) is struggling to scale above the resistance line. The price turned down from the resistance on Apr. 03 but found support just above the 20-day EMA. Traders would have closed partial long positions as suggested in our previous analysis.If the bulls succeed in breaking out of the overhead resistance, a rally to $0.14861760 is probable. This might act as a stiff resistance because the long-term downtrend line is also located just above this level. On the downside, the 20-day EMA will act as a strong support. Both the moving averages are trending up gradually and the RSI is close to the overbought zone. This shows that the bulls are in command. If the XLM/USD pair scales above the downtrend line, it might signal the end of this downtrend. Traders can keep the stops on the remaining position at breakeven.ADA/USDCardano (ADA) witnessed profit booking above $0.094256 levels on Mar. 03, It fell to $0.081791 on the next day but quickly bounced back, which shows buying on dips. Currently, the bulls are attempting to push the digital currency above the overhead resistance once again.If successful, a rally to $0.112598 is probable. Above this level, there is no major resistance until $0.20. We suggest traders trail the stop loss on the remaining long positions to $0.080.The trend remains up with both the moving averages sloping up and the RSI in the overbought zone. But after the sharp rally, a pullback or a consolidation cannot be ruled out. The ADA/USD pair will enter a correction if the price plummets below $0.081791. The first support on the downside is at the 20-day EMA, which is likely to hold. Traders should look to buy on dips as long as the trend remains up.TRX/USDTron (TRX) could not sustain the breakout above $0.02815521 on Mar. 02 and 03. However, on the downside, it took support at the 20-day EMA, which is a positive sign. Currently, the bulls are attempting to breakout of the overhead resistance once again. If successful, it is likely to start a new uptrend. Therefore, traders can wait for a breakout and close (UTC time frame) above $0.02815521 to initiate long positions. The stop loss can be kept at $0.024, which can be raised later.The first target on the upside is $0.040. If this level is crossed, the rally can extend to $0.0480. With the 20-day EMA starting to slope up and the RSI close to the overbought zone, the path of least resistance is to the upside.Our bullish view will be invalidated if the TRX/USD pair again fails to sustain above $0.02815521 and plummets below the moving averages.The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.","The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.Bitcoin has been the main attraction in the past week, as it has scaled every stiff hurdle with ease. The rally has helped its market dominance hit levels not seen since December 2017. After a long time, the traders have focused on the positives and have disregarded the negative news. This shows that the sentiment is bullish.A rally being led by the largest cryptocurrency is a bullish sign. Some believe that the upward move is a result of increased activity by institutional players. While we are surprised by the pace of the rally, we believe that this is not sustainable and a repeat of the previous bull market is unlikely. Bitcoin will soon enter a consolidation or a minor correction that can be used as a buying opportunity.The recovery in cryptocurrencies has enabled projects to source funds easily. Bitfinex has received hard and soft commitments for its $1 billion initial native exchange token offering. Similarly, blockchain equity loan platform Figure, backed by Morgan Creek has sealed a $1 billion “uncommitted” financing facility via blockchain.Will bitcoin pull the altcoins higher, or will the altcoin rally indicate that the retail crowd is jumping in and a short-term top is close by? Let us see what the charts of the top five performers of the past seven days project.BTC/USDBitcoin (BTC), with its scintillating run, is back in the limelight. One of the world’s top cryptocurrency exchanges, Binance, was hacked and 7,070 in bitcoin was stolen from its hot wallets. However, the hack did not rattle the markets as it continued its uptrend after a brief pause. When markets do not correct on negative news, it is a bullish sign.Galaxy Digital CEO Michael Novogratz expects the lifetime highs to be scaled within the next 18 months. Financial advisory firm Canaccord Genuity also arrived at a similar conclusion based on their studies: they expect bitcoin to hit $20,000 by 2021. Tim Draper, however, is even more bullish, as he expects Bitcoin to reach $250,000 by 2023.However, we suggest traders not to get carried away by these lofty targets. Let’s see what the charts project.The BTC/USD pair is easily breaking out of the overhead resistances. We were expecting the recovery to pause in the zone of $6,000 to $6,480.54, but the pair easily crossed this zone. It has a minor resistance at $6,850, above which the rally can extend to $7,500 and if that level is also crossed, it can move up to $8,500.However, the sharp rally has pushed the RSI on the weekly charts into the overbought zone for the first time since early January 2018. This shows that the rally has been persistent and strong.Any dip will find support at $5,900 and below it at $4,900 levels. The next fall might form a higher base and be the last opportunity to buy before the cryptocurrency enters a sustained long-term uptrend.ETH/USDWhile ether (ETH) volumes on decentralized applications (DApps) hit a new high, the number of new DApps deployed on-chain is at a low, close to 2017 levels, according to crypto analytics firm Diar. Over the next 12 months, the Ethereum Foundation plans to spend $30 million for various projects across the ecosystem. Helped with a donation of $1,000 Ether each by Joseph Lubin, Vitalik Buterin, ConsenSys and the Ethereum Foundation, the Moloch decentralized autonomous organization’s total funds have reached $1 million.An unidentified official of the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission said that an Ether-based futures product might receive the approval of the regulator if it meets the requirements. Can these bullish developments propel the cryptocurrency higher?After defending the breakout level of $167.20 for the past four weeks, the bulls are attempting to resume the uptrend. This is a positive sign. The breakout of the ascending triangle can push the price to $256.08, above which a move to $300 is probable.The ETH/USD pair might face some resistance at the 50-week SMA, but we expect this level to be scaled.Our bullish view will be negated if the bears reverse direction from the current levels and sink the pair back into the triangle. Such a move will invalidate the breakout of the bullish pattern, which is a bearish sign.BCH/USDMore than 50% of transactions in bitcoin cash (BCH) are being generated from a single account. These are small transactions in value but are being done on a regular basis — about three to four transactions per second. Some believe that this is being done to make the network look busier than it is, while others speculate that it is being done for a test. Nevertheless, all eyes will be on the forthcoming upgrade of the network on May 15.The BTC/USD pair has been trading in a tight range of $255 to $335.62 for the past four weeks. The attempt by the bears to breakdown from this range failed, as the bulls purchased the dip to the 20-week EMA.Currently, the bulls are attempting to ascend the overhead resistance zone of $335.62 to $363.3. If this zone is scaled, the pair is likely to move up to $600. Though there is a minor resistance at 50-week SMA, we expect it to be crossed. Traders can buy above $370 and keep a stop loss of $260. Please use only 30% of the usual position size for this trade: if the cryptocurrency struggles to breakout of $400, traders can quickly raise the stop loss to reduce the risk.Our bullish view will be invalidated if the price reverses direction from the overhead resistance and plummets below the 20-week EMA.LTC/USDA new version Litecoin Core 0.17.1 was released which brings in new features, bug fixes, performance improvements and more. Will the bullishness in bitcoin rub off on litecoin? Let’s find out.The LTC/USD pair has formed a cup and handle pattern, which will complete on a breakout and close above $91. This will have a minimum target objective of $158.91, but the momentum can carry it to $172.647 levels. The traders can buy on a breakout and close (UTC time frame) above $91 and keep a stop loss of $65. The moving averages have completed a bullish crossover and the RSI is in the positive zone, which suggests that the bulls are in command.Still, please keep the position size only 50% of normal: let’s keep our risk under control.Our bullish assumption will be negated if the price fails to breakout and sustain above $91 and drops below $65. In such a case, a fall to $40 and lower is possible.XMR/USDCybercriminals are finding new ways to exploit the vulnerability CVE-2019-3396 in Confluence, a widely used collaboration and planning software, according to a report by security intelligence firm Trend Micro Inc. Monero (XMR) is the fifth best performer of the past seven days. Can it improve its performance over the next few days? Let us find out.The XMR/USD pair has been consolidating for the past five weeks, and has a stiff resistance at $81. The 50-week SMA is also located just above this level. Hence, we anticipate this zone to act as a stiff hurdle for the bulls.But if the bulls breakout of the 50-week SMA, it will signal strength and can gradually move up to $120 and above it to $150. Conversely, if the bears sink the pair below $60, it can retest the lows at $38.5.Traders can wait for the price to breakout and close (UTC time frame) above $81 to initiate long positions. The initial stop loss can be kept at $60, which can be trailed higher as the cryptocurrency moves northwards.The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.

The news was revealed in a Gemini blog post on April 15.","SegWit is a scalability solution for the bitcoin network, first activated in late 2017. As well as increasing block size, Segwit moves the “witness” signature data to a separate location. It thus solves what is known as transaction malleability, which is conducive to second-layer solutions like Lightning Network (LN).Claiming that Gemini is the first major crypto exchange to launch full — rather than partial — SegWit support, the blog post’s author, Brian KimJohnson, wrote that Gemini will enable SegWit addresses to be used for both bitcoin deposits and withdrawals. The platform has also launched support for transaction batching, he reported.KimJohnson also wrote that Gemini did not make the decision lightly and that its “choice to use native SegWit addresses was based on block space savings as well as safety concerns.”His arguments in favor of SegWit emphasize that with its segregation of digital signatures from transaction data, “bitcoin transactions weigh around 30–40 percent less, thus taking up less ‘block space’ on the network and reducing the transaction fee.”The blog post lastly underscores that the support will lay the groundwork for solutions such as LN — a second-layer solution to bitcoin’s scalability limitations, which works by opening payment channels between users that keep the majority of transactions off-chain.As previously reported, major crypto exchange and wallet service Coinbase and its professional trading platform Global Digital Asset Exchange GDAX — now known as Coinbase Pro — rolled out SegWit support for bitcoin transactions in early 2018.Both Coinbase Pro and Gemini have recently been included in a newly-launched index for 10 cryptocurrency exchanges from crypto analytics firm Messari. The index, dubbed “Real 10 Volumes,” was evidently created in response to widespread concerns over allegedly rampant fraudulent trade volume reporting among unregulated exchanges."

Lee made his comments during an interview with Cointelegraph published on April 19.,"During the interview, Lee noted that through 2018, the BMI has not been over 50, while it now recently touched a value of 89. According to Lee, values over 67 have never taken place in a bear market.Lee concluded:“It means that a bull market is likely starting.”Still, he also explained that when the indicator reported such a high value, “six out of six times, there was a drawdown in the market.” Lee claims the drawdown averaged to 25% in such instances, and that in the short term, the market could see a headwind. Moreover, he also stated that this could also mean that investors could be moving their capital to altcoins instead.Lee also pointed out that bitcoin recently broke the 200-day moving average, which he believes means that bitcoin’s recovery is happening faster than they expected. This is in line with what he stated in mid-March, when Lee said that he thinks “the key number to watch is the 200-day moving average.”Lee noted that this breakout could also mean that this time, the recovery won’t be different than it has been in the past, and that bitcoin could easily recover to new highs. Still, when asked if new highs for the coin will be achieved this year, Lee answered that while he believes they will be reached, he does not know when.According to Lee, there are various reasons for the recent trend inversion in the crypto market. For instance, he mentioned that old and wealthy bitcoin wallets have recently started adding BTC, and that transaction activity has begun increasing along with crypto exchange volumes.As Cointelegraph reported in January, the number of active bitcoin wallets, many of which have long been dormant, has seen an uptick.Earlier this week, digital assets fund Adamant Capital published a report claiming that the cryptocurrency bear market is winding down and is in its final stage."

The hackers allegedly encrypted government records, blocking access to critical information and leaving the city without an ability to accept utility payments other than in person or by regular mail.A city spokeswoman, Rose Anne Brown said that the city had to spend over $900,000 on new computer software that had been planned for next year. Following the event, the city council unanimously agreed to pay 65 BTC ($592,000 at press time) to restore access to the data and get their systems back online, although there is purportedly no guarantee that the hackers will release the data upon receiving payment.Michael van Zwieten, director of technology services at the Florida League of Cities, said:“All cities, whether large or small, are by nature very cost-conscious when it comes to budgeting for technology investments. The mid- to small-sized cities are especially strained when it comes to finding the necessary resources to keep their technology current. There are only a finite amount of dollars that can be divvied up within the city to fund the services its citizens are expecting.”In May, the city of Baltimore experienced a similar hacker attack, wherein cybercriminals allegedly took over roughly 10,000 government computers and paralyzed the work of the local utility system using a ransomware called RobbinHood. The hackers demanded nearly $100,000 worth of BTC to release the back up. The hackers threatened to increase the ransom in the event of not paying in four days.In response, Baltimore Mayor Jack Young said that the city officials are “well into the restorative process” and “engaged leading industry cybersecurity experts who are on-site 27-7 working with us.”As recently reported, blockchain intelligence firm Chainalysis claimed that 64% of ransomware attack cash-out strategies involve the laundering of funds via cryptocurrency exchanges. Among other ransomware cash-out strategies analyzed, 12% involved mixing services and 6% involved peer-to-peer networks, while others went via merchant services providers or dark web marketplaces. 9% of ransomware proceeds reportedly remain unspent."

hack on May 7, when around 7,074 bitcoins (worth $40 million on the ...","May 17, 2019","While it’s possible to buy top cryptocurrencies like bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) in the over-the-counter (OTC) market, most people will need an exchange in order to buy other altcoins. Exchanges are simply an important component of the system that makes the crypto market tick. Regulators around the world have identified this, which is why regulatory moves have primarily targeted exchanges. Regulators want to be sure that exchanges employ the best security practices as well as measures — Know Your Customer (KYC), Anti-Money Laundering (AML), and Combating the Financing of Terrorism (CFT), for instance — that discourage illicit transactions and improve account/wallet security.","Some exchanges do take their compliance to those measures seriously. For example, in the aftermath of the Binance hack on May 7, when around 7,074 bitcoins (worth $40 million on the day) were stolen, the company’s founder and CEO, Changpeng Zhao, announced that a significant security update will be conducted that will also include an upgrade to the KYC measures:“We are making significant changes to the API, 2FA, and withdrawal validation areas, which was an area exploited by hackers during this incident. We are improving our risk management, user behavior analysis, and KYC procedures.”So, let’s break down if such a stance over compliance with measures like KYC, AML and CFT is common among top cryptocurrency exchanges, and how much of an effect they have on the market and its participants.Each country has its laws governing KYC, AML and CFT measures. However, these laws do not come with specific standards, mainly because regulators want financial institutions to do all they can to reduce risks.“The reasoning seems to be that if banks get clear guidelines on what constitutes adequate KYC they will never look any further than the minimum requirements,” John Callahan, chief technology officer at Veridium, an identity and access management software company, wrote in Forbes.Know Your Customer, refers to a set of procedures and process that a company employs to confirm the identity of its user or customer. The robustness of KYC procedures varies across companies and jurisdictions. However, KYC fundamentally involves the collection and verification of a customer’s means of identification — including government-issued identity cards, phone numbers, a physical address, an email address and a utility bill, to name a few.Anti-Money Laundering measures are a set of procedures, laws and regulations created to end income generation practices through illegal activities. Some of them include tax evasion, market manipulation, public fund misappropriation, trade of illicit goods and other activities of this kind.AML regulations require financial institutions to continuously conduct due-diligence procedures to detect and prevent malicious activities.The crypto industry has already been cited as facilitating a “rise of a new, high-tech era of virtual money laundering,"" with cryptocurrency gambling sites reported by blockchain research house CipherTrace as being a common money laundering tool. In addition, Jamal El-Hindi, the former acting director of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Commission (FinCEN), a part of the United States Department of Treasury, hinted that AML compliance will be fundamental to the stability of crypto exchanges in the coming years:""We will hold accountable foreign-located money transmitters, including virtual currency exchangers, that do business in the United States when they willfully violate US AML laws.”Combating the Financing of Terrorism refers to the set of procedures aimed at investigating, dissecting, discouraging and blocking sources of funding intended for activities that realize religious, ideological or political goals through violence, or its threat thereof, against civilians. These procedures provide law enforcement agencies with an alternative, and potentially effective way to track and block terrorist activities.Yaya Fanusie, the director of analysis for the U.S. Foundation for Defense of Democracies Center (FDD), earlier in September 2018, told the U.S. Congress that terrorist organizations aren't using cryptocurrency as a funding vehicle. However, the U.S. House of Representatives, on Sept. 26, passed a bill that would establish a task force to fight the use of cryptocurrencies by terrorist groups.As stated earlier, the process of regulatory compliance for AML and CFT involves KYC throughout transaction lifecycles. The KYC process is generally divided into four levels, namely:Based on the information available, it can be examined how exchanges handle these stages. Crypto exchanges will be divided into two groups namely the “fiat-to-crypto” exchanges and “crypto-to-crypto” exchanges. Fiat-to-crypto exchanges are the gates for new fiat money to enter the cryptocurrency market. These exchanges allow users to exchange fiat currencies like dollars for bitcoin, ether or any other supported cryptocurrency. Crypto-to-crypto exchanges, on the other hand, primarily allow users to exchange one cryptocurrency for another.A few top fiat-to-crypto exchanges include Coinbase, Coinbase Pro, Gemini, Bittrex, Kraken, Bitfinex and Bitstamp.Fiat-to-crypto exchanges typically perform at least some level of KYC because they deal with fiat money. This forces them to conduct business with banks and other traditional financial institutions, most of whom conduct KYC procedures before doing business with any entities.Coinbase is a licenced crypto exchange based in the U.S. A full list of the licenses it holds is here. All that the exchange requires to open an account is a full name, an email address and a password. While this means that anyone from anywhere in the world can store, send and receive cryptocurrencies using a basic Coinbase account, ID verification is required to buy and sell cryptocurrency in the 33 countries it supports.For its KYC, Coinbase chose Jumio’s digital identity solution Netverify in an attempt to be regulatory compliant while still delivering a smooth customer experience. In a bid to further mollify regulators, the company hired former New York Stock Exchange executive Peter Elkins to build the Coinbase Trade Surveillance Program, an initiative to monitor the markets with the aim to weed out bad actors.Also licensed by the U.S. government, Gemini, unlike Coinbase, conducts KYC before allowing anyone to use its platform. On its user agreement page, Gemini states at least 13 regulations — including FinCEN, AML and CTF regulations — to which the users of its platform must be compliant. The exchange was launched in 2014 by brothers Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss.At the start of the second quarter of 2018, a few months before Coinbase’s trade surveillance reports surfaced, Gemini partnered with U.S.-based stock exchange Nasdaq, which is one of the two largest exchanges in the world, for the deployment of Nasdaq's SMARTS Market Surveillance technology to track market manipulations and fraudulent trades. The surveillance moves from both Gemini and Coinbase put them in the third stage of the KYC process.Bitstamp requires ID and address verification before users can start trading on the platform. In the wake of surged interest in bitcoin, the exchange partnered with Onfido in February 2018, a digital identity verification provider, to handle its KYC to the end in order to make the customer onboarding process frictionless. Bitstamp was originally founded in Slovenia in 2011, but moved to the United Kingdom in 2013, and then to Luxembourg in 2016.On Nov. 5, Bitstamp chose Cinnober's crypto trading system for its exchange. Cinnober claims that its trading solution is built for regulatory compliance. The solution also employs Irisium's market surveillance technology for risk management. Cinnober boasts a list of customers, including the NYSE, the London Stock Exchange, Euronext, and the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, to name a few.Developed by fintech company iFinex, Bitfinex allows crypto users to open an account and immediately deposit, trade and withdraw crypto without identity verification. However, verification of a phone number, a residential address, two forms of government-issued ID and a bank statement is required to deposit and trade fiat currencies.Earlier in the year, Bitfinex employed Irisium’s market surveillance technology to detect fraudulent behavior on its exchange. Bitfinex is based in Hong Kong.Bittrex requires ID verification before allowing users to deposit, trade or withdraw cryptocurrencies. However, other than having a user agreement page that says its operations comply with KYC, AML and CTF policies — as does every other exchange — it is unknown if the exchange employs a market surveillance technology or plans to do so.Kraken launched following two years of product development and beta testing, making it one of the oldest crypto exchanges. It has five tiers of verification (tier 0 to 4) requirements, depending on users’ intent to use their account. Kraken founder Jesse Powell decided to build the exchange after seeing the struggles of the then-largest — but now defunct — crypto exchange Mt. Gox.Unlike Gemini and Coinbase, Kraken doesn't appear to have any publicized surveillance program. All that is known comes from a Kraken blog post that was issued in response to the New York attorney general's questionnaire. The company said:“We currently employ nearly 200 people (more than 25% of the company) in compliance-related functions. As of Q1 2018, we are processing more than 1 law enforcement request per day, seven days a week.""At the end of the second quarter of this year, a Bloomberg report called out irregularities involving certain tether trades on the Kraken exchange. John Griffin, a professor of finance at the University of Texas, told Bloomberg that the irregularities noticed are “suggestive of wash trading.” This technique is sometimes employed by traders, who act as both seller and buyer in a given transaction, to give a false impression of supply and demand. This act in itself is illegal. Kraken discredited the content of the report in a blog post. “It’s not clear what harm could come from wash trading of a pegged asset against its peg,” Kraken wrote.Based on data from CoinMarketCap, top crypto-to-crypto exchanges include OKEx, Binance, Huobi, HitBTC, Bibox, ZB.com, Coinbene and LBank.Binance, being a pure cryptocurrency exchange, isn’t as exposed to regulations. Therefore, it allows withdrawals of up to 2 BTC per day without any form of ID verification. For withdrawals up to 100 BTC per day, it requires photo ID verification.OKEx, which partially allows fiat trades, has three levels of verification. Level 1 users have a transaction limit of $10,000 per order or $2,000 for fiat trades, and are required to provide a government-issued ID during verification. Its level 2 allows for trades over $10,000, and requires document verification. Level 3 is for trades above $200,000 and involves video verification.HitBTC doesn't perform any form of ID verification at account opening. Users can deposit and trade crypto without going through any KYC procedures. However, the exchange advises users to verify their identity by sending in the usual KYC documents, including bank documents, to its compliance department via email to “avoid eventual verification procedure in the future.” Users have taken to a number of social media channels to complain that HitBTC allegedly limited their accounts, with the exchange operator asking them to verify their identities.Huobi doesn’t appear to require any KYC documents before allowing users to trade, but it does have an ID verification section in the settings area of a user’s account. It appears to only enforce KYC when users reach a certain account usage limit. In addition, Huobi has different withdrawal limits for verified and unverified users.Bibox allows users to trade up to 2 BTC per day without any form of KYC verification. For trades up to 20 BTC per day, it requires a passport verification. On its website, Bibox advises users who want a higher limit to reach out to its support team via email. All that is required to deposit funds and start trading with Bibox are account security measures, including SMS and Google authentication.Put simply, similar to fiat-to-crypto exchanges, the top crypto-to-crypto exchanges, as determined by their 30-day volume on CoinMarketCap, have some sort of KYC policy that they enforce at different stages. However, many of them haven’t been proactive about compliance.“To gain respect and empathy from regulators, crypto exchanges need to be proactive about compliance,”  Tony Mackay, who recently launched the Kryptos-X exchange, said. He went on:“At the minimum, you want to get the on-boarding stage right, even if the crypto market is currently under-regulated. You also want to ensure that your user registration system can detect and deter criminal activities, using the expertise of best-in-class KYC/AML providers.”Also, unlike their fiat-to-crypto counterparts, crypto-to-crypto exchanges — except for Binance — haven't been reported as monitoring or tracking transactions to detect market manipulation or fraudulent behaviors.In October, Binance partnered with Chainalysis, a compliance and investigation company catering to the cryptocurrency space. As part of the partnership, Chainalysis did a global roll-out of its compliance solution, which has a Know Your Transaction (KYT) feature. KYT is a real-time transaction monitoring solution for cryptocurrencies. U.S. agencies — including the IRS and FBI — are using Chainalysis’ solution to track cryptocurrency transactions.A recent report from P.A.ID Strategies, a payments and identity security consulting firm, found that the majority of crypto exchanges “lack sufficient background checks.”It also claims that exchanges, at best, take a reactive approach to being compliant. Only a few have set up a system for monitoring behaviors and appear prepared to deal with regulators despite the under-regulation of the industry.A recent emerging trend in the crypto space has been that of exchanges closing their offices in highly regulated jurisdictions and setting up shop in jurisdictions — such as Malta — where the local laws are “crypto friendly.” Binance and OKEx are the most notable examples.For some crypto firms compliance is a double-edged sword in that on one side, firms ensure that no illicit activity is conducted on their platforms, while potentially compromising on the notion of decentralization on the other side.In June 2019, new Financial Action Task Force (FATF) guidelines will be imposed that govern AML and CFT activities. The announcement from February states:“Countries should ensure that VASPs [virtual asset service providers] are subject to adequate regulation and supervision or monitoring for AML/CFT and are effectively implementing the relevant FATF Recommendations, to mitigate money laundering and terrorist financing risks emerging from virtual assets. VASPs should be subject to effective systems for monitoring and ensuring compliance with national AML/CFT requirements.”There are many who disagree with the tightening of controls, saying that, first of all, it would be difficult to set up domestic regulatory bodies, and in the meantime, companies may suffer as they will become overburden by reporting.It is also not always possible to know the identity of the beneficiary, whom the destination wallet belongs to and what type of a wallet it is, according to Chainalysis. The company states that it would be more beneficial to collect wallet addresses of bad actors instead of user’s personal information."

The profile of the author makes it clear that he indeed claims to be the same Satoshi Nakamoto who created bitcoin (BTC):“Satoshi Nakamoto is the renowned inventor of Bitcoin.”The author’s profile also states that “100% of his book royalties to support STEM and environmental education programs serving underprivileged youth.” The store descriptions of the books themselves seemingly contain inside jokes about the cryptocurrency space and the myth of Satoshi Nakamoto.Wave and Ripple Design Book, for instance, appears to hint at both the Japanese roots of the bitcoin creator’s pseudonym, as well as to Ripple (XRP):“A wonderful selection of wave and ripple designs curated by Satoshi Nakamoto. [...] Yuzan's designs were often used by Japanese craftsmen in the early 1900s to adorn their wares with wave and ripple patterns.”The second book, The Official Bitcoin Coloring Book, contains less subtle jokes such as stating that it has been “printed on a brilliant white paper.” The product page also displays editorial reviews by Etheorum creator Vitallike Buttering, J.P. Morgain CEO Diamond James, and billionaire investor and Chairman of the Bored Buffet Warden, all misspellings of individuals and organizations famous within the space.As Cointelegraph recently reported, many have claimed to be the mysterious Satoshi over the last 10 years, but their assertions have always been met with skepticism and have lacked any substantive evidence.At the end of May, a Chinese citizen residing in California claimed copyright to bitcoin’s white paper, claiming to be Satoshi Nakamoto. This copyright claim came on the heels of an identical one by Craig Wright, who has long declared himself to be the inventor of bitcoin, despite public backlash and his own periodic slip-ups while maintaining that narrative."

Indeed, he emphasized that cryptocurrencies accompany illegal financial activities such as money laundering by moving money off “from a transparent platform into a dark platform.”Stiglitz argued that “there is no need for anybody to go to a cryptocurrency,” claiming that such a currency does not have any of the attributes of what he calls a good currency, while the United States dollar does have all those attributes.However, the world-known economist still expressed confidence in an electronic payments mechanism that would represent a transparent financial system. According to Stiglitz, real time data about what people are spending would bring about both a better regulated economy and macroeconomic management.Stiglitz had previously made a similar statement about crypto in 2017, claiming that bitcoin should be banned since it does not serve any socially useful function and only poses major risks to investors due to its high volatility.Recently, Cointelegraph reported that the Indian government is considering a complete ban of cryptocurrencies, and has allegedly launched new inter-ministerial consultations on a draft bill to do so."

Now that the bill has been passed, the revised acts are expected to come into force in April 2020, Cointelegraph Japan reports.The proposed amendments to Japan’s financial instruments and payment services laws will ostensibly tighten cryptocurrency regulation in a bid to promote user protection, more robustly regulate crypto derivatives trading, mitigate industry risks such as exchange hacks, and broadly establish a more transparent regulatory framework for the new asset class.As previously reported, the bill also establishes a legal name change for cryptocurrencies as “crypto assets,” formerly designated in the country as “virtual currencies.”The bill also provides for more robust legislation for crypto margin trading, limiting leverage to two to four times the initial deposit.Cointelegraph Japan today notes that, while there is reportedly a view within the industry that regulation has thereby been tightened, some consider that Japan's virtual currency regulation will set a global benchmark for regulating the sector.In April, Japan’s minister of finance and deputy prime minister, Taro Aso, urged reporters to stop using the term “virtual currencies” and to shift to the newly introduced legal name. The new definition ostensibly aims to prevent investors from confusing cryptocurrencies with legal tender.Earlier this month, Cointelegraph reported that Russia was postponing the adoption of crypto regulation due to a requirement from the Financial Action Task Force that it expand the terminology of a federal bill to legislate major industry terms such as cryptocurrencies and bitcoin (BTC)."

BitPay purportedly charges a 1% commission to convert the funds, which Corporate Traveller says is cheaper than credit card processing.Other firms and organizations in the tourism and travel industries have begun accepting cryptocurrencies, citing customer demand. In March 2018, the German National Tourist Board announced that it takes bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies as payment for its services.In August of the same year, the state government of the Australian province of Queensland issued a grant to the TravelbyBit digital currency payments platform, which aimed to boost tourism in Central Queensland through selling travel offers with cryptocurrencies.BitPay, for its part, recently reported that it saw over $1 billion in transactions last year.

Its launch of the Liquality Atomic Swap Interface alpha will now enable users to swap BTC, ETH and DAI directly between their Ledger or Metamask crypto wallets. In implementing the solution, Liquality notes that users maintain custody over their own keys, thereby apparently eliminating custodial risk and maximizing their privacy and financial sovereignty. To access the interface, users can either run a self-hosted version or use a downloaded app. In addition, Liquality has made its codebase open-source on Github.In the blog post accompanying the new release, Liquality also provides updates on developments thus far in 2019, which include the publication of educational content on both atomic swaps and hash time locked contracts.Also new is support for both sending and receiving cryptocurrencies from a single Ledger wallet device, support for DAI, and WebUSB Ledger connection issues, the blog post notes.In the coming months, the project reportedly aims to roll out several new features as requested from users. Among these are Trezor integration, Segwit support, support for litecoin (LTC) and privacy coins, automated swaps and customizable parameters for lock times and mining fees.Given the persistence of centralized crypto exchange hacks — including several major incidents thus far in 2019 — development of non-custodial exchange methods is gaining steam, including decentralized exchange (DEX) services and atomic swap-enabled over-the-counter (OTC) trading."

aware of the existence of Bitcoin see the top-ranked cryptocurrency as a ...","Apr 14, 2019","Data from Google Trends shows that Lagos, Nigeria ranks as the number one city based on the volume of online searches for Bitcoin (BTC). While this data may indicate a high level of interest among the city's approximately 21 million people, it has yet to equate to tangible adoption of the emerging trend of technology.","But that is changing, as a growing movement among young people frustrated with existing payment systems looks for alternatives.For the most part, “Lagosians” who are aware of the existence of Bitcoin see the top-ranked cryptocurrency as a substitute for the United States dollar. BTC exists for them on a spectrum that lends itself as a viable substitute for foreign currency.Payment companies like PayPal do not allow Nigerians to receive money transfers from abroad, thanks to the notoriety of internet fraudsters in the country — and the companies that offer such services usually charge high fees.Thus, it is common to see the city's growing freelancing community beginning to pivot toward cryptocurrency payments. Many of the youth in the city, having battled with underemployment or unemployment, have sought to try their hands outside the traditional working environment.The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) reports that Nigeria's unemployment rate rose to above 23 percent in 2018. In a city like Lagos, many young university graduates can be seen making a living as freelancers, offering services from copywriting to website design and even computer programming.Given that many of their clients are based abroad, there can be issues with receiving payment for the work done. However, with a BTC wallet and a plethora of local exchange services, these freelancers can receive payments easily from clients spread across the globe.Apart from freelancers, business owners are also using Bitcoin, as well as other crypto-focused platforms, as substitutes for foreign currency and banks. Companies like BitPesa offer easy access to liquidity, which can be a hassle to businesses in frontier markets like Lagos, especially in the context of foreign trade.In a private message to Cointelegraph, Victor Alagbe, the Chief Operating Officer (COO) and Blockchain Strategist at OneWattSolar, an energy startup looking to leverage blockchain technology in boosting renewable energy adoption across Africa, said:“I see crypto taking up a strong position in the remittances space. It’s often cheaper, less stressful (in terms of documentation) and faster to send and receive crypto. Many younger folks in the diaspora are now leveraging crypto to send money back home. Some techies working remotely are also getting paid in crypto.”In 2001, the government at the time introduced mobile telecommunications technology to the country. In the 18 years since that landmark event, mobile telecoms have become a significant sector in the nation's economy, contributing 10.5 percent of its gross domestic product as of mid-2018.Nigeria has over 100 million active internet subscriptions, mostly on mobile platforms. Bitcoin as a payment technology leverages on this access to the web, allowing tech-savvy Nigerians to participate in the growing cryptocurrency trend.While the peer-to-peer (p2p) trading aspect of the emerging BTC narrative continues to take shape in Lagos, there is a massive underutilization of the technology itself. Even with the potentially paradigm-shifting aura attached to cryptocurrency, Lagos — and, by extension, Nigerians — seem content to focus only on BTC as a dollar substitute without diving deeper into the technological ramifications of broader Bitcoin adoption.Data from Bitnodes, which tracks the global Bitcoin nodes distribution, shows that there are virtually no nodes in the country. Yes, Lagos leads the way in online BTC searches. But only a handful of people run actual Bitcoin nodes.This reticence for a broad-based adoption isn't entirely down to apathy toward the technology itself, but is, instead, a representation of the lack of proper infrastructure on which to support a vibrant digital economy. In a city that lacks constant electricity supply, the fact that people aren't running Bitcoin nodes hardly comes as a surprise.Concerning Bitcoin underutilization, Alagbe opined:“There’s still a whole of lot education that needs to go into helping people understand the relationships between Bitcoin (crypto) and its underlying Blockchain technology. However, the Nigerian market is likely to focus on crypto to the exclusion of other applications of Blockchain inasmuch for as long as there’s profit to be made in the speculative side of cryptocurrency.”Another startling indicator of Bitcoin underutilization in the city comes from the lack of retail acceptance of the cryptocurrency. While metropolitan areas in the United States, Europe and parts of Asia have increasingly seen more retail adoption of BTC as a payment means, Lagos rarely registers on the map, as indicated by Coinmap.The OneWattSolar COO highlights this same trend, declaring:“In my opinion, Bitcoin (and cryptocurrency in general) is still seen as a speculative play to make quick gains. You can see people trading huge sums of Bitcoin on platforms such as Remitano but you’ll be hard pressed to find a business that accepts crypto as payment for products or services.”At the time of writing this article, Coinmap reports that there are more than 14,600 venues that accept Bitcoin payments across the globe. Only South Africa registers any significant BTC adoption in the retail scene as far as Africa is concerned.Once again, Nigeria risks falling behind the rest of the world in the race to embrace the emerging digital landscape. While other megacities obtain first-mover advantages in being at the forefront of the emerging digital revolution, either by ignorance or the absence of requisite basic infrastructure, Lagos continues only to associate with the basic aspects of BTC adoption.Over the last decade-and-a-half, Nigeria has gained notoriety for being home to internet fraud. While this image continues to be inimical to the aspirations of honest and hardworking Nigerians, it has also contributed to many people casting a jaundiced glance in the direction of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general.This situation hasn't been aided by the fact that BTC began to come into public consciousness after the debacle of the Russian Mavrodi Mondial Moneybox (MMM) scam. For the most part of 2016 and 2017, many characterized BTC as the ""new MMM.""In a private chat with Cointelegraph, Joseph Samuel, a blockchain analyst, web designer, and team leader at “Humane Love,” a Lagos-based charity project on the EOS blockchain spoke about how some Lagosians tend to conflate and confuse Bitcoin and MMM, saying:“Many Nigerians got to know about Bitcoin during the MMM Ponzi scam. As a result, they tend to see Bitcoin as another fraudulent investment scheme. However, with proper education, this misinformation can become a thing of the past.”In so doing, they missed out on the massive profits gained by early adopters during the late 2017 bull rally. With BTC almost eclipsing the $20,000 mark in late 2017, having begun the year trading below $1,000, the usual opportunists came out of hiding to evince designs of fraudulent schemes centered around Bitcoin.For Samuel, the city still has time to catch up to the rest of the world, declaring:“Lagos is a mega city filled with some of the smartest people in the world. Unfortunately, the fear of the unknown prevents many from adopting newer technological breakthroughs. Once they become more amenable to change and realize what Bitcoin represents, Lagos will become a major hub in the developing digital economy.”Organizations like the Cryptography Development Initiative of Nigeria (CDIN) and the Nigerian Blockchain Alliance (NBA) have been at the forefront of combating cryptocurrency scams in Lagos and other parts of the country. Together, these institutions collaborate with agencies like the Nigeria Electronic Fraud Forum (NeFF) to prevent the proliferation of Bitcoin-related criminal activity.Historical charts from Coin Dance shows a massive increase from 2016 in Bitcoin trading volume on Localbitcoins — a p2p BTC trading platform. This marked increase was no coincidence, as 2016 saw the country's economy go into its worst recession since 1987.Around that time, many local digital payment companies in the city also began to pivot to Bitcoin. New businesses also sprang up, offering avenues to purchase the cryptocurrency. Cointelegraph spoke with Adekemi Bitire, a marketing executive at IBIC Exchange, an over-the-counter (OTC) Bitcoin exchange in the Yaba area of Lagos, about the BTC adoption trend in the city. Bitire explained:""Over the course of my involvement in the Bitcoin OTC scene here in Lagos, I have observed an exponential increase in the number of people adopting BTC trading. More people are getting into the business, earning steady commissions, and improving their standard of living.""Bitire elaborated on the expanding demographic of BTC adoption in the city:""Apart from university students and out-of-college freelancers, we are also seeing mid-level employees of companies in the city using Bitcoin as a way of creating another revenue stream to augment their monthly salaries.""The present-day reality in Nigeria is one many believe is firmly entrenched in the weaponization of ignorance and poverty for the sole purpose of disenfranchising the majority. The ruling oligarchy, while enjoying the commonwealth of the people, propagates a message of ""living within one's means,"" a euphemism, some say, for the glorification of poverty that simultaneously casts aspersions on the desire to achieve economic and financial emancipation.Within that alleged construct of this tyrannical state-sponsored weaponization of poverty lies a veritable tipping point for greater Bitcoin adoption in Lagos and other places in Nigeria. The core principle of BTC lies in libertarian ideals that are at odds with the socialist politics of mass economic disenfranchisement.Data from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) shows that about 31 million of the country's population own bank accounts. Figures from the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) show 83 million registered voters. The fact that the total addressable market for business in Nigeria is 63 percent less than the total number of eligible voters paints an alarming picture.Bitcoin is a multi-billion-dollar market that encompasses more than a cross-border payment system. It represents the ability to build a decentralized global market infrastructure free from censorship. Thus, there exist a myriad opportunities for greater BTC adoption in a mega city like Lagos.With such a high percentage of unbanked and underbanked people, especially in rural areas, increased BTC adoption presents a viable alternative to traditional banking services. Places in Southeast Asia that suffer from the same problem are already showing a considerable increase in cryptocurrency adoption.Greater emphasis on creating more user-friendly methods of making BTC payments could see the technology spread to rural areas where the people might not be as tech-savvy as their urban counterparts. The bulk of unbanked and underbanked people live in these impoverished, rural settlements, as it is in most other places in the world.Increased BTC adoption can help to create an expanded set of ""means"" within which ambitious and upwardly mobile people who pursue legitimate livelihoods can improve their standard of living. This outcome will, however, remain unattainable if the allure of BTC remains firmly rooted in the realms of being a ""side hustle.""Victor Alagbe of OneWattSolar encapsulates the need for a more broad-based approach to Bitcoin and blockchain technology in Lagos, Nigeria, and Africa as a whole, declaring:“I think the fact that the Nigerian market is interested in crypto is good for the eventual mainstream adoption of Blockchain technology. Blockchain introduces trust in inherently trustless environments such as ours; hence, when Blockchain-powered projects (DApps) that are not overly bundled with crypto hits the mass-market, they’ll probably be quick to gain traction.”There are far larger social and economic implications at play than Bitcoin as a dollar substitute. By creating useful technological and financial products and services centered on Bitcoin, the top-ranked cryptocurrency could potentially create far greater utility for Lagos — and Nigeria as a whole."

Prosecutors in Santa Clara announced the jail sentence on April 22.,"In February, Joel Ortiz had pleaded guilty and to theft and accepted the 10-year plea deal.Ortiz stole more than $7.5 million from at least 40 victims: the press release notes that he then spent $10,000 a time at Los Angeles nightclubs, hired a helicopter to fly him and his friends to a music festival, and bought top-end Gucci clothes and luggage.  In May 2018, one cryptocurrency entrepreneur in Cupertino lost $5.2 million in a matter of minutes, prosecutors note.Prosecutors described the one-time high school valedictorian as a “prolific SIM swapper who targeted victims to steal cryptocurrency and to take over social media accounts with the goal of selling them for bitcoin (BTC).”Illegal SIM swaps often involve duping phone companies into switching cell phone numbers to a new SIM card by providing stolen addresses and social security numbers. From here, hackers can circumvent two-step authentication measures that are designed to keep crypto safe.Ortiz was detained at the Los Angeles International Airport last year, and investigators say they have only been able to recover $400,000 of the stolen funds. They believe the rest has either been hidden or spent. Prosecutor Erin West said:“These are not Robin Hoods. These are crooks who use a computer instead of a gun. They are not just stealing some ethereal, experimental currency. They are stealing college funds, home mortgages, people’s financial lives.”Oritz had been sentenced on April 19 by a judge after two hearings where victims described the financial devastation caused by his crimes.In February in a separate case, an individual was indicted in New York for stealing identities and funds, including crypto, in the state’s first SIM swapping prosecution."

'privacy coins' better than they can distinguish bitcoins from coinjoins.","Jun 24, 2019",Co-founder and CEO of major U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase Brian Armstrong attracted criticism after praising private crypto transactions in a tweet published on June 22.,"In the aforementioned tweet, Armstrong notes that “a scalable, sufficiently decentralized, chain that supported private transactions by default (privacy coins) would be a game changer.” He then compares anonymous cryptocurrency transactions to cryptography on the web, pointing out that it is increasingly predominant. He also used messaging as an example:“Same with messaging, end to end encryption started out fringe and is now the expected default.”Armstrong also cited the recent news about the Electric Coin Company (ECC), the firm behind second-biggest anoncoin zcash (ZEC), intending to build a new scalable zcash blockchain as an example of privacy by default. In response, Luke Dashjr raised a question towards what he perceives to be an unclear stance on privacy on Coinbase’s part:“Why does @Coinbase seem to blacklist people who might get their coins from certain sources, if you support privacy? I'm a bit confused...”To which bitcoin core developer answered stating that — according to him — as long as it is possible to distinguish “dirty” coins, the exchange is forced to block them. Self-proclaimed bitcoin (BTC) maximalist Giacomo Zucco stepped in disagreeing:“Complete nonsense. They can distinguish ‘privacy coins’ better than they can distinguish bitcoins from coinjoins. [...] If they are forced to blacklist CJs, they'll be forced to blacklist ‘privacy coins.’”Then, when a different user asked whether Coinbase blocks CoinJoin transactions, Zucco claimed “Of course. And (the very few and low-anonymity set anyway) shielded Zcash txs.” According to a post published by the exchange in late November 2018, Coinbase does not fully support zcash shielded addresses:“Initially, we will support deposits from both transparent and shielded addresses, but only support withdrawals to transparent addresses. In the future, we’ll explore support for withdrawals to shielded addresses in locations where it complies with local laws.”As of press time, Coinbase, Giacomo Zucco and several representatives of zkSNACKs, the company behind CoinJoin-enabled BTC wallet Wasabi wallet, have not responded to Cointelegraph’s inquiry. As a consequence, it has not been confirmed whether Coinbase is blocking CoinJoined BTCs.As Cointelegraph reported at the time, data provided by zkSNACKs CTO Adam Fiscor revealed at the end of April that mixed bitcoin transactions now represent 4.09% of the total after CoinJoins have risen by 300% in the space of nine months.As a recent Cointelegraph analysis explains, bitcoin’s increasing anonymity is considered a threat to privacy-focused coins by some."

Omni, by interfacing with our existing institutional liquidity pool, will offer retail customers a top tier experience from day one.""As part of a wider re-orientation, LedgerX reportedly plans to launch a retail-focused version of its derivatives trading platform, dubbed “Omni,” which would list BTC futures, options and swaps and provide clearing and custodian services based on LedgerX’s existing infrastructure.Amid ongoing talks with regulators in regard to the prospective license, Chou stated that:“I think at this current time we don’t see the demand growing among really large institutions and banks. We are still a $85 billion market cap for bitcoin — really just the size of a large stock. Right now we see the opportunity towards the other end of the spectrum.”As previously reported, the CFTC currently remains in talks with the yet-to-be-launched institution-focused trading platform Bakkt — created by New York Stock Exchange operator Intercontinental Exchange — which has its sights on its own physically-settled BTC futures product.Other players hoping to launch physically settled BTC futures include ErisX and Seed CX, both institution-oriented.This January, LedgerX released its first bitcoin price volatility index, having launched reportedly the first ever CFTC-licensed bitcoin savings product in May 2018."

The latest avalanche of news from Facebook, however, makes this lead look less convincing, as it becomes apparent that the social media giant’s blockchain project is also well underway.","After a series of indirect cues suggesting that Facebook’s long-rumored fintech initiative is in motion, a massive breakthrough came with a detailed report from The Information, which mainly relied on anonymous sources to unearth many newsworthy particulars related to the forthcoming token. A European Facebook executive validated some of the details shortly after, confirming that a white paper outlining the cryptocurrency’s essentials is set to be published on June 18. Here is what we know of the future coin’s design and governance, as well as its potential implications for the digital economy, according to some leading voices in the crypto space.According to The Information’s report penned by Alex Heath and Jon Victor, Facebook’s crypto project kicked off roughly a year ago when the company brought in David Marcus, former president of PayPal, to lead the charge. The e-payments giant would go on to become a major source of manpower for the initiative, enhanced with some additions of Coinbase alumni on the compliance side. In early 2019, Facebook incorporated the entire team previously employed by a blockchain startup Chainspace. MIT professor Christian Catalini has been reportedly appointed as the project’s chief economist.Overall, staff deployed on the project is estimated to be at least a hundred strong, with some more open positions still up. In contrast to Facebook’s normally open-space culture, employees working on the blockchain initiative are reportedly concentrated in a separate building behind closed doors.Despite earlier reports by the BBC suggesting that Facebook’s prospective cryptocurrency has been known internally as GlobalCoin, The Information’s dossier makes no mention of this label. The publication’s sources insist on another codename that has also previously been circulated in the media, Libra.In addition to registering a company called Libra Networks in Switzerland in May, Facebook bought out the trademark from a namesake blockchain startup. TechCrunch’s Josh Constine hypothesized that the name could be wordplay on the abbreviation LIBOR, which stands for the London Inter-bank Offered Rate, a benchmark for interbank borrowing. Constine said, “LIBOR is for banks, while Libra is meant to be for the people.”The Information’s sources revealed that Facebook’s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, has taken a great personal interest in the crypto project, while some others among the firm’s C-suite, such as chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg and chief financial officer David Wehner, remained skeptical.The Libra team reportedly presented three possible investment scenarios to Facebook leadership, ranging from low to high commitment, and Zuckerberg ultimately opted for the maximum investment route. Facebook CEO’s attention to building a payment system on top of the platform fits well into the proclaimed turn toward facilitating more personal and small-group forms of communication.As a borderless currency with no transaction fees when used within the Facebook ecosystem (Messenger, WhatsApp and Instagram), the prospective coin is poised to make a considerable impact in developing countries, where the company is looking to primarily market it, according to The Information’s report.Read more on this: Libra Project: Facebook Stablecoin Aims to Conquer Online Payments Market, Reports SuggestWhile the social platform’s existing user base exceeds 2 billion people globally, a significant portion of it come from regions where traditional financial institutions are not quite reliable, and fees on cross-border remittance payments are often exorbitant. If users come to associate the digital coin in their smartphone messaging app with real value, Libra could become a game-changer in areas such as cross-border payments, casual Venmo-style transactions within friend groups and e-commerce generally, as more and more merchants join the realm of Facebook-powered social platforms to sell their goods directly.Prominent blockchain advocate and Wall Street veteran Caitlin Long, who was among the first to share her vision of Facebook’s cryptocurrency in light of the latest news, wrote in a Forbes op-ed that “Facebook’s cryptocurrency will be a powerful force for good in developing countries.” Long argued that, by providing a more reliable store-of-value than central banks, Facebook’s stablecoin would pressure financial authorities into monetary discipline.In order to maintain value, according to The Information investigation, Facebook’s coin will be pegged not just to one currency, but to a basket of several currencies and low-risk securities. The company’s head of financial services and payment partnerships for Northern Europe, Laura McCracken, has also confirmed this in an informal conversation with a reporter from German magazine WirtschaftsWoche, although nothing is known yet about the basket’s composition.The Information’s report also specifies that Facebook plans to provide physical infrastructure — in the form of ATM-style terminals — to enable users to exchange the digital asset for fiat currencies. In addition, Facebook employees will be reportedly given an option to receive part of their salaries in the token, a detail that Gizmodo’s Victoria Song called the resurgence of the “company town dream” in the digital age.These days it is difficult to find a person who is not alerted to Facebook’s control of (and, sometimes, questionable practices of handling) user data. The fact that the company’s ambitions now extend to a comparable degree of control over online payments might appear sinister. Anticipating pushback from vigilant users and regulators alike, the company seems to have introduced a degree of decentralization into the way its cryptocurrency governance model is laid out.According to The Information’s report, for the past few months, the social networking company has been talking to dozens of financial institutions and tech companies, soliciting their participation in an independent foundation tasked with the new crypto payment system’s oversight. The measure should promote trust in the system, as well as pacify antitrust regulators. Sunita Parasuraman, who has worked as Facebook’s corporate head of treasury operations, will reportedly manage the foundation’s treasury.Unsurprisingly, the privilege of validating transactions on Facebook coin’s ledger will be reserved for a selected few. A license to operate a node on the network will reportedly cost outside entities $10 million each, and will come with a right to delegate representatives to the foundation and participate in the network’s governance. The network is expected to launch with 100 nodes, possibly with a prospect of further decentralization as more nodes join in. The Information’s sources claim that Facebook will use licensing fees to establish the initial pool of value for the coin.It is not yet clear how node operators will be rewarded in the absence of transaction fees and The Information’s claim that Facebook is not planning to use the payment system for ad targeting. The latter notion can strain skeptics’ credulity, given the company’s business model and the wealth of valuable data on purchasing habits that the currency use will generate. One of the possible answers is the interest that will accrue from the assets underlying the token — and node operators will likely hold a lot of it.Furthermore, Long predicted that Facebook will share the generated interest profits with all users and holders of its token in order to avoid high-profile accusations of simply pocketing it, which would immediately follow otherwise. As a collateral effect, Long writes, this might turn public attention to the issue of corporate welfare in the U.S. banking system: The Federal Reserve, it turns out, pays its member banks 2.35% for interest on excess reserves.Having learned the hard way how much of a trouble regulatory scrutiny can present, Facebook has been working closely with financial authorities across the board to ensure compliance. The new cryptocurrency is believed to incorporate solid identity verification and have fraud prevention mechanisms in place.According to Long, it means that Facebook will leverage a massive “tax data honeypot” for multiple governments, which may attempt to trade regulatory latitude for a certain degree of access to this data. In the big picture, the project will likely highlight the archaic character of many extant financial regulations and set in motion processes of gradually making them more up to date. The ride, however, will be bumpy, as the launch of Facebook’s payment system will spark heated debates about privacy and corporate power in the context of money.Over in the crypto Twitter-sphere, intense debate immediately broke out, as opinion leaders began to figure out who the new coin’s immediate competition might be and whom it will obliterate. Charlie Shrem, a founding member of the Bitcoin Foundation, opined that Libra is a direct threat to Ripple’s XRP:Facebook is launching their global crypto coin called “Libra”. What’s interesting is they are offering companies to pay $10m to become “validators”. If anything, it renders Ripple useless 😂. The first companies to create a LIBRA/BITCOIN exchange will make a killing!Long-time Ripple investor Kieran Kelly differed, suggesting that it is bitcoin that is now on the line:Libra/Facebook Coin is a considerable threat to Bitcoin. XRPs main focus is as a bridging asset and on demand liquidity for banks and remittance companies. Libra sits in the same market as Bitcoin, as a direct competitor, but Facebook has a mass following unlike Bitcoin. 😬 https://t.co/PYhgMcpY3tYet another opinion, perhaps more optimistic than most of the crypto industry, came from Mati Greenspan, a senior trade analyst at eToro, who contended that it is traditional currency that is threatened here:Facebook coin isn't a competitor to Bitcoin, it's a competitor to the Dollar.Weiss Ratings’ lead cryptocurrency specialist, Juan M. Villaverde, formulated the central question somewhat differently in an email to Cointelegraph:“Is Facebook really moving into the cryptocurrency space? Or is it merely porting some crypto technology over to the traditional fintech industry?”Villaverde sees all indications that it is going to be the latter. However, it is not necessarily a bad thing, as Facebook seems to be serious about delivering user-friendly financial services to millions of users who have virtually no other access to banking.The fact that deployment of the company’s cryptocurrency is set to start from India, the nation with the second-largest unbanked population in the world, suggests that Facebook is ready to go in that direction. However, we should make no mistake with regard to Facebook coin’s relation to decentralized digital currencies, Villaverde said:“Facebook is looking to provide payment services to its customers. To do so, it must act as a counterparty and custodian for every payment that goes through its platform. It must have the last word on any payment users make or seek to make. Just like a bank, credit card company or PayPal. In sum, the Facebook coin will compete with established payment processors. Cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin or Ethereum, are built from the ground up to disrupt them. The Facebook coin will be another layer built atop the existing financial system — another intermediary, another counterparty, plus all the corresponding risks. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are slated to render every one of those layers obsolete.”In her op-ed, Long offered a somewhat more optimistic vision of the Libra project. She thinks that Facebook’s cryptocurrency will become a Trojan horse that will eventually benefit bitcoin:“Facebook’s foray into cryptocurrency will likely end up being a beneficial detour on the path to broader bitcoin adoption. Bring it on!”Facebook’s initiative, Long predicts, will dramatically increase the pace at which people learn about cryptocurrency in general, and when the general public becomes educated enough, it will likely opt for bitcoin, which is scarce, rather than Facebook’s token, which is not."

BSV is famously backed by Craig Wright, an Australian entrepreneur, chief scientist at his startup called nChain and self-proclaimed Satoshi Nakamoto.After Binance, one of the world’s largest crypto exchanges, decided to delist BSV amid Wright’s campaign to deanonymize one of his critics, other major platforms — including ShapeShift and Kraken — followed suit.As a result, the price of BSV tanked. Meanwhile, Wright and his team have purportedly served some of their critics with court documents, demanding public apologies.The delisting marathon was preceded by Craig Wright’s run-in with an anonymous Twitter personality nicknamed Hodlonaut, who also organized the Lightning Torch campaign. According to crypto news outlet Coingeek (founded by billionaire Calvin Ayre, who has been vocal about his support for BSV), Hodlonaut targeted the Australian businessman with offensive tweets, calling him “a very sad and pathetic scammer. Clearly mentally ill,” and allegedly participating in the creation of the #CraigWrightIsAFraud hashtag.While Craig Wright has repeatedly claimed that he is Satoshi Nakamoto, much of the cryptocurrency community seems skeptical about those statements, widely referring to Wright as “faketoshi.” Back in December 2015, Wired and Gizmodo reported that the Australian computer scientist might be the creator of bitcoin (BTC), but a substantial part of the evidence presented in the reports — both of which cited an anonymous source who had contacted them voluntarily — was soon proved false. Wired subsequently assumed that Wright “was likely pulling an elaborate hoax or con” to present himself as Satoshi to the public.On April 11, Coingeek went as far as to set a $5,000 bounty in BSV for information regarding the true identity of Hodlnaut, while also demanding that the Twitter user should publicly apologize to Wright both on the social media platform and during an open court hearing. The article contained informal language, alleged pictures of Hodlonaut, his or her approximate location, and explicitly called for deanonymization:“Wright is demanding that the individual behind the @Hodlonaut account tweet an apology to him, make a statement in open court apologizing to Wright and acknowledge the falsity of the allegations made against Wright. Instead, Hodlonaut seems to have hidden under his mother’s skirt and is nowhere to be found.”Hodlonaut has since deleted his or her Twitter account. In response, the cryptocurrency community on Twitter began trending a #WeAreAllHodlonaut hashtag to show support. Moreover, an eponymous website was created to crowdfund BTC in order to help Hodlonaut fund his or her legal battle with Wright. According to the information posted on the website, the pseudonymous Twitter user had received a letter from Wright’s legal team before erasing his or her online presence. In it, Wright’s lawyers were allegedly threatening to sue Hodlonaut for defamation in a United Kingdom court (as per Wright’s LinkedIn profile, the Australian entrepreneur currently resides in London. According to earlier reports, he lived in Sydney, and local police had raided his house).As of press time, more than $28,700 has been raised via weareallhodlonaut.com, which is more than 140% of the initial goal of $20,000. The website states that Hodlonaut personally controls the funds from this campaign and that any excess contributions will be sent to Bitcoin Venezuela, the same charity-focused organization that received donations from the Lightning Torch campaign.Cointelegraph has reached out to Preston Byrne, an attorney at Byrne & Storm and who claims be to handling Hodlonaut’s case pro bono, but he declined to comment.Notably, earlier in March of this year, not long before erasing his presence on Twitter himself, Wright tweeted that he will be “taking action aggressively to remove any site that is in error or makes false claims,” referring to people calling him a fraud, among other things.  “You do not have a right to lies under ‘free speech’ nor harassment, nor libel and slander,” he wrote. “If an error is reported in a malicious context concerning me, expect to be living in a barrel when we finish with you.”Peter McCormack, the host of the podcast “What Bitcoin Did,” is another person who has reportedly been approached by Wright’s legal team. According to McCormack’s tweets, after he tagged Calvin Ayre’s account to declare that Wright is a fraud and provided his personal address in Bedford, U.K. for legal correspondence, he allegedly received a letter from SCA Ontier LLP, a London-based law firm. In it, like in the case of Hodlonaut, he was asked to publicly apologize to Wright both on Twitter and in court.Moreover, Wright’s attorney reportedly stated that his client “has not fraudulently claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto” since his client allegedly is Satoshi Nakamoto. The statement further claims that Wright wrote bitcoin’s original white paper, sent the first bitcoin transaction and played an integral role in the network’s development.McCormack then shared what he calls his “formal response,” where he declined to apologize to Wright and asked him to provide evidence that would confirm that he is Satoshi Nakamoto. On April 18, McCormack was allegedly served with a service claim for 100,000 British pounds (around $130,000).Seamus Andrew, managing partner at SCA ONTIER LLP, has verified to Cointelegraph that his firm represents Craig Wright and that they are in the process of taking legal action, but did not specify whether or not they were suing McCormack or Hodlonaut.“I confirm that we act for Craig Wright, and that we are in the process of bringing legal proceedings against certain individuals and entities who have defamed our client,” Andrew said via email.Cointelegraph has requested for a comment from McCormack to clarify the details of his case, however, as of press time, he has not replied.The situation escalated on April 11, when Changpeng Zhao, founder and CEO of Binace — currently the world’s fourth-largest crypto exchange by adjusted daily trade volume — warned that he would delist BSV (which trades under the ticker BCHSV on the platform) if the creator of the altcoin — i.e., Craig Wright — does not correct his behavior. The tweet seemed like a reaction to Wright’s action against Hodlnaut:“Craig Wright is not Satoshi. Anymore of this sh!t, we delist!”The community reacted to Zhao’s warning by asking various exchanges to delist BSV and by kick-starting a #DelistBSV hashtag.On April 15, Binance officially announced that it will delist BSV. Specifically, the exchange stated that, as of April 22, it will delist the altcoin and cease trading all of its trading pairs. In the accompanying statement, Binance explained that it regularly reviews assets listed on its platform “to ensure that it [the asset] continues to meet the high level of standard we expect.” The firm went on to explain that it only delists a coin after a second in-depth review, noting, “We believe this best protects all of our users.”Thus, the exchange listed the responsiveness to its due diligence requests, the level and quality of the coin’s development, as well as “evidence of unethical / fraudulent conduct” among the factors that it takes into account before delisting a cryptocurrency.Later, on April 15, anonymous exchange ShapeShift and crypto data supplier and cryptocurrency wallet Blockchain.com also announced they were dropping BSV. On Twitter, ShapeShift CEO Erik Voorhees confirmed that the company came to a decision to stop listing the altcoin for reasons similar to those of Binance:“We stand with @binance and CZ's sentiments. We’ve decided to delist Bitcoin SV #BSV from @ShapeShift_io within 48 hrs.”Other crypto platforms took a slightly different approach, letting their users decide whether to delist or keep BSV via Twitter polls. For instance, instant crypto exchange service ChangeNow wrote:“As a service strongly disagree with Craig Stephen Wright's policies and business decisions - everything, really.However, we believe that the @BitcoinSVNode community should not suffer because of some decisions one man made.So, do you think we should #DelistBSV? $BSV #BSV”Similarly, major United States crypto exchange Kraken has decided to delist BSV following the results of a Twitter poll. In the official press release, the platform said that BSV had “engaged in behavior completely antithetical to everything we at Kraken and the wider crypto community stands for.”BSV price had tanked as much as 20% following the series of delisting announcements, according to data obtained from CoinMarketCap, but currently shows signs of a slight recovery. As of press time, it is trading around $60, gaining back around 5% during the past few days.Notably, the delisting announcements drew a negative response from some community members. “I have no love for bsv but I also take no joy in seeing a biased, bot infested platform like twitter being used to shut coins down with the impression they are democratic votes on a unbiased platform,” a Redditor wrote on the r/btc subreddit.“Delisting bitcoin SV from some of the popular exchanges certainly was harmful to the project,” Matthew Greenspan, eToro senior market analyst, told Cointelegraph over Skype after a warning that it was difficult for him to comment on the case since he knew Hodlonaut and participated in the Lightning Torch experiment.  “I would say it was a slap to bitcoin SV and its founders. […] Some of their opinions and threats have been extremely unpopular in the crypto community,” he said. “Now it will be harder for people to buy and sell it [BSV], and it will be harder for it to gain real liquidity in the market.” Greenspan also added that the results of the polls held by Kraken and other crypto platforms are “self-evident.”Wright’s company, nChain, which designed bitcoin SV and is responsible for its technical development, has denounced the #DelistBSV campaign. “The sudden delisting of Bitcoin SV by some exchange is absolutely unjustifiable and sets a terrible precedent for the cryptocurrency industry,” Jimmy Nguyen, the chairman of nChain, told Cointelegraph.According to Nguyen, the BSV network became much stronger after Binance, Kraken and other exchanges listed it on their platforms after November’s hard fork of the BCH network. Since then, more mining pools, wallets, applications and services have begun working with BSV, nChain’s chairman added, while the daily average block size of BSV was increased as well, showing technical development of the altcoin. “Therefore, there is even more reason to list BSV, not delist it,” Nguyen argued.“The delisting decision is driven by personal dislike of Craig Wright and retaliation for steps Craig has taken to pursue personal legal rights against people he believes are defaming him,” Nguyen said. That, according to him, is a menacing sign for the community:“A dangerous precedent has been set if an exchange uses its CEO’s personal dislike of a coin’s individual supporter as the reason to make delisting decisions. What if one day Vitalik Buterin took personal actions that offended an exchange CEO? Should that be the basis to delist Ethereum?” Nguyen asked. “Whether you agree with Craig Wright’s personal legal actions or not, Craig’s invoking of legal remedies are for a court of law to decide — not crypto exchanges.”The nChain chairman also criticized the idea of using Twitter polls to decide whether to delist BSV, calling it “ridiculous.”  He went on, saying:“It’s not hard to imagine the Twitter polls are just providing cover for a delisting decision already made. Twitter polls are not even limited to the exchanges’ customers, can be easily manipulated by bots and multiple anonymous accounts, and create the climate for mob rule. I expect regulators around the world to take a critical look at this Twitter poll charade.”When asked whether he condones Wright’s behavior, Nguyen repiled:“Like every person, Craig is entitled to invoke whatever legal rights are available to him, and let the legal system decide. He is defending himself after years of cyber bullying. Craig now simply wants a court of law, rather than the Twitter-sphere or exchange CEOs, to decide.”Some crypto platforms deliberately chose not to follow suit and left BSV on their platforms. Thus, on April 16, OKEx, a massive cryptocurrency exchange that is currently ranked the number one exchange on CoinMarketCap based on adjusted trading volume, announced that it decided not to delist Wright’s controversial cryptocurrency after conducting “a rigorous review on BSV in terms of technology development, liquidity, and compliance.” The exchange wrote:“According to the OKEx Token Delisting and Hiding Guideline, BSV currently does not meet our delisting criteria. As such, OKEx has no intention to delist BSV for the time being.“As a neutral platform, OKEx respects the efforts of all dedicated teams in advancing the technology of Bitcoin and has no inclination to certain technical directions.”Japanese financial services giant SBI Holdings went even further and declared it will delist BCH  from its virtual currency exchange in June 2019.As per the original statement on the matter, SBI Holdings delisted BCH because of “a significant decrease in the market capitalization” and a “high possibility” of a 51% attack.“If so [SBI Holdings delisting BCH while keeping BSV], it would be quite funny for them to delist Bitcoin Cash ABC [BCH] due to the possibility of a 51% attack and not to delist other coins,” market analyst Matthew Greenspan told Cointelegraph. “If you look at crypto51.app it shows you that a possibility of a 51% attack and Bitcoin Cash ABC is very low on that list, even lower than Ethereum… and Bitcoin SV is at the 5%.”Notably, as Cointelegraph Japan reported, Yoshitaka Kitao, CEO and representative director of SBI Holdings, has a connection with the BSV founder, with Wright having revealed their close relationship in a tweet in January, demonstrating that he and Kitao spent time together and claiming that he treats Kitao as “a friend and man I respect a lot.”Regardless of what happens next, the latest BSV drama has showcased the power that the community has over the market. Greenspan agrees with that statement. “Historically, we can see that community has an incredible influence over the technology and the paths that crypto takes,” he said. “Satoshi Nakamoto also predicted this as he spoke about hard forks and splits of the network. His sentiment was basically that the stronger fork or network will always survive whereas the lesser fork will be in deep trouble and we can see that clearly here.”"

The news was reported by local broadcasting station KBS World Radio on May 28.,"Today’s meeting, led by the Minister of the Office for Government Policy Coordination, Noh Hyeong-ouk, was largely prompted by bitcoin (BTC)’s recent break above 10 million won (~$8,400), the report states. The coin last hit a similar valuation around a year ago, with local officials ostensibly interpreting the fresh surge as a sign of a possibly overheating market.Meeting participants reportedly included officials from the Ministry of Economy and Finance, the Justice Ministry and the country’s financial regulator, the Financial Services Commission (FSC).Areas of focus included a plan to closely surveil domestic crypto exchanges and to intervene in a bid to minimize ramifications for investors should the market continue to pump.Other plans include a pledge to take robust action against any detected fraud by maintaining close coordination between law enforcement authorities and the FSC.In addition, the meeting established the need to swiftly pass a pending revision to the country’s Financial Information Act, which would outlaw money laundering by crypto exchanges.As Cointelegraph reported last month, research from software firm DataLight has suggested that the United States, Japan and South Korea are the world’s biggest fans of crypto exchanges.The report further claimed that bitcoin’s recent price surge had prompted associated phenomena — notably including South Korea’s erstwhile Kimchi Premium surcharge — to reappear, with DataLight proposing the events contributed to the exchange visit rates."

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.","Market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.After the recent rally in crypto markets, most analysts believe that the bear market is over. Barry Silbert, Digital Currency Group founder and CEO, opined that the crypto winter is over and the markets have entered a “crypto spring.” Silbert pointed out that institutional involvement has grown a lot since the 2017 bull phase, which is the cause of his bullish stance.Contrary to this opinion, blockchain researcher Tone Vays said that he does not trust the current rally as it is not backed by considerable external money investing in crypto markets. According to him, the existing long-term investors have supported the rally from the lows and if their conviction waivers, the markets can plunge once again. Still, he advises people to hold “some bitcoin.”We believe that the bear market is over and the markets will form a higher base during the next fall. However, we are against chasing prices higher. Instead, we believe that the markets will give enough opportunities to buy on dips. Hence, traders should be patient and buy when the risk to reward ratio is in their favor.Let’s take a look at the charts and see if we find any buying opportunities at current levels.Bitcoin (BTC) has broken out of the 20-day EMA after struggling to sustain above it for the past few days. This shows fresh demand at higher levels. If the price maintains above $8,120, the bulls will try to push it to $9,053.12. A breakout of this level will invalidate the head and shoulders (H&S) pattern, which is a positive sign. The next target to watch on the upside is $10,000.On the other hand, if the BTC/USD pair fails to sustain above the 20-day EMA, the bears will try to sink it to the neckline of the H&S pattern. If the price breaks down and closes (UTC time frame) below the neckline, it will complete the H&S pattern that has a target objective of $5,371.12.However, the bulls might try to provide support close to $7,413.46 and below it at the 50-day SMA. If both these supports break down, a fall to $5,900 is probable where we expect strong buying. Currently, we do not find a reliable buy setup, hence, we do not suggest a trade in it.Ethereum (ETH) is stuck inside a large range of $225.39 and $280. The 20-day EMA is flat and the RSI is just above the midpoint. This suggests that the consolidation might continue for a few more days.The ETH/USD pair has broken out of the 20-day EMA. It will now try to move up to $261.59 and above it to $280. A breakout and close (UTC time frame) above $280 might propel it to $322.06 and above it to $335.However, if the pair fails to break out of $280, the bears will try to sink it back to $225.39. A breakdown of this support and the 50-day SMA will attract further selling. The next support on the downside is way lower at $167.20. We do not find any reliable buy setups at the current levels, hence, we are neutral on the digital currency.The bulls have been trying to keep Ripple (XRP) inside the symmetrical triangle but are facing stiff resistance at the 20-day EMA. For the past two days, the cryptocurrency has formed inside day candlestick pattern, which shows that the volatility is shrinking.Presently, the bulls are trying to push the XRP/USD pair above the 20-day EMA. If successful, a move to $0.43196 and above it to the resistance line of the triangle is possible. Conversely, if the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, the bears will try to sink the pair below the strong support of $0.35660. Therefore, traders holding long position can keep the stop loss at $0.35.Litecoin (LTC) continues to be in a strong uptrend. It easily climbed above the resistance line of the ascending channel, which shows strong demand. Both the moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is in the overbought zone, which confirms that the bulls are in command.There is a minor resistance at $140.3450. If the LTC/USD pair struggles to break out and sustain above it, traders can book partial profits closer to $140 and trail the remaining long position with stops just below the 20-day EMA. As the moving average moves up, stops can be raised higher. The target to watch on the upside is $158.91 and above it $184.7940.The digital currency will lose momentum if it turns down and slides back into the ascending channel. A break below the 20-day EMA will be a negative sign and can attract further selling.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has been clinging to the 20-day EMA for the past few days. We should soon see a large range move either to the upside or to the downside. A breakout and close (UTC time frame) above the 20-day EMA can carry the price to $451 and above it to the resistance line of the ascending channel.On the other hand, if the BCH/USD pair turns down and breaks below the 50-day SMA, it can correct to the support line of the channel. We anticipate strong buying at this level. If the price rebounds sharply from it, we might suggest a long position. The stop loss can be kept just below the channel. However, if the pair plunges below the channel, it will turn negative and can drop to $280.EOS is finding support at the 50-day SMA, which is sloping up and is facing resistance at the 20-day EMA, which has started to turn down. This shows that volatility is tightening. We should soon see the volatility expand. However, it is difficult to predict the direction of the expansion. Hence, we can not take any predetermined action.If volatility expands to the upside and the EOS/USD pair climbs above the 20-day EMA and $6.8299, it can move up to the resistance line of the channel and above it to $8.6503. As the risk to reward ratio of this trade is attractive, we maintain the buy proposed in an earlier analysis.On the other hand, if the bears sink the pair below the 50-day SMA, it can drop to the support line of the channel. If this breaks down, a fall to $4.4930 is probable.Binance Coin (BNB) has broken out of the downtrend line and has triggered the buy recommendation given in the previous analysis. It can now move up to $38.6463356 and above it to the resistance line. If the bulls can push the price above the resistance line, a rally to $46.1645899 is possible. Both the moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is in positive territory, which shows that bulls have the upper hand.Contrary to our assumption, if the BNB/USD pair fails to sustain above the downtrend line the bears will try to sink it below the 20-day EMA. If successful, the next stop on the downside is the 50-day SMA. This has acted as strong support in the past few months, hence, we expect it to hold. Therefore, the stops on the long positions can be kept at $28.Bitcoin SV (BSV) has been holding above the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of the recent rally for the past three days. Though this is a positive sign, the failure of the bulls to secure a strong bounce shows a lack of buyers at higher levels.If the bears plunge the BSV/USD pair below $176.083 and the 20-day EMA, the uptrend will lose momentum. The next support is at $152.015, which is 50% retracement level of the recent rally. If this support also gives way, the fall can extend to $134.360.Contrary to our assumption, if the pair rebounds sharply from the current levels or from the 20-day EMA, the bulls will try to carry it to $240, above which a retest of the lifetime highs is probable. The digital currency will pick up momentum after it sustains above $254.Stellar (XLM) is facing stiff resistance at the 20-day EMA. If the bulls fail to sustain the price above the 20-day EMA, the bears will try to sink it below the strong support of $0.11507853.If the XLM/USD pair breaks down of $0.11507853, it can correct to $0.08558676, but if the bulls succeed in pushing the pair above the 20-day EMA, it can rally to $0.14861760. This is a critical resistance. A breakout and close (UTC time frame) above this level will complete an inverse H&S pattern that has a target objective of $0.22466773. We will wait for the price to sustain above $0.14861760 before proposing a trade in it.Cardano (ADA) is range-bound between the 50-day SMA and $0.10. It sharply bounced off the 50-day SMA on June 10 and is nearing the overhead resistance of $0.10. A breakout and close above $0.10 will complete the rounding bottom pattern that has a target objective of $0.22466773.Previously, the cryptocurrency had broken out of $0.10 on three occasions but failed to sustain it. Therefore, we will wait for the price to break out and close (UTC time frame) above $0.10 before suggesting a long position in it.If, however, the ADA/USD pair fails to breakout and sustain above $0.10, it will extend its stay inside the range for a few more days. It will turn negative if it reverses direction and plummets below the 50-day SMA. The next target to watch on the downside is $0.057898.Market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange."

The claim has been made by researchers from blockchain intelligence firm Elliptic, as reported by Reuters on April 26.","As Cointelegraph previously reported this January, a spokesman for the group’s military wing had called upon supporters to make donations to the organization in bitcoin (BTC) as a strategy to combat financial isolation.Hamas’ financial isolation stems from its classification as a terrorist organization, in whole or in part, by several countries and international blocs — including the United States and the European Union. Having ruled the Gaza Strip since 2007, Hamas comprises a social service arm “Dawah” and a militant faction “Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades,” the latter of which initiated this year’s bitcoin fundraising appeal.Russia, Turkey and China are among those who do not designate Hamas as a terrorist entity.According to Reuters, Elliptic’s research unit has claimed that the al-Qassam Brigades has adapted its crypto fundraising mechanism in recent weeks.Having initially appealed to contributors to donate to a single bitcoin wallet address, the group’s website now allegedly generates a unique new wallet address for each donation transaction.Whereas a given crypto wallet can efficiently be red-flagged by investigative authorities, the proliferation of multiple unique address significantly complicates such efforts, the report notes.Elliptic’s data reportedly reveals that between March 26 and April 16, 0.6 bitcoin — worth around $3,099 at press time — was sent to the group’s website-generated multiple wallets. Since the start of its campaign, the al-Qassam Brigades has raised around $7,400, Elliptic claims.While the firm declined to disclose most of the specific details of its findings, it reportedly succeeded in identifying the flow of transactions from these addresses via two unnamed Asia-based crypto exchanges. Elliptic has not reportedly ascertained whether the crypto had yet been converted to fiat currencies.As reported, this February, an Israeli blockchain intelligence firm claimed it had identified proof of donations in bitcoin reaching Hamas, estimating that around $2,500 in donations had been made within two days of the first wallet address publication."

His 2014 book, Mastering Bitcoin, gave an in-depth technical analysis of the top cryptocurrency and a solid foundation of the crypto revolution’s beginnings.","In a recent interview, Cointelegraph spoke with Antonopoulos on what he believes is the future of blockchain’s social impact, what’s going on with the current crypto market volatility, and what is still missing in the crypto space.This interview has been edited and condensed.Molly Jane Zuckerman: In your opinion, is the recent volatility in the crypto markets a positive development for overall crypto adoption?Andreas Antonopoulos: Volatility is an inevitable fact that arises from the small size and limited liquidity of crypto markets at the moment. When it's downward volatility, it creates panicked sentiment and losses. When it's upward volatility, it creates a wave of fear-of-missing-out (FOMO) investors with very little understanding of the technology fundamentals or principles.Fortunately, some of those investors stay through the cycle and try to learn more about the technology, building a more solid foundation of users for the next cycle.This cyclical boom-bust pattern is part of the behavior of this technology and has now repeated more than 8 times in the last 10 years. It is dangerous for inexperienced investors, but it also provides the funding needed to develop each stage of infrastructure and technology. Caveat emptor!MZ: What are concrete developments that you feel the Bitcoin blockchain needs in order to be more widely adopted?AA: As new technology is developed at the protocol layer, it does not get adopted until it can be presented in a clear, unambiguous, secure and easy-to-use way as a user interface and user experience. This happens at the product/application design layer and it is where the greatest development is needed. The open blockchain space in general needs more design and creative people, not more software engineers.MZ: What, in your opinion, went wrong and what went well in the blockchain and crypto industry in the last year? Do you think we are closer to blockchain adoption now than we were a year ago?AA: In bitcoin, the scaling debate has quieted down, as ""forks"" have given everyone a choice to pursue any scaling strategy they want. Unfortunately, this has created some confusion as more than one ""fork"" attempt to use the same name. In the end, the choice is up to users and the name is not as important as the rules of consensus each user chooses to follow.In other open blockchains, the scaling debates are just beginning, as they encounter the same growing pains as bitcoin did in the last 3 years. Every blockchain will face these issues, despite claims to the contrary. Scaling requires deliberate design tradeoffs, against decentralization and security.Many open blockchains try to claim they have solved this trilemma but they're either lying or are unaware of the tradeoffs they have made to gain scalability. In this space, maturity and growth bring new challenges in scaling and eventually governance. All blockchains will face those challenges once they become big enough to matter.MZ: What is the social impact you personally expect from blockchain technology in the years to come?AA: The primary impact I see is open and disintermediated platforms and protocols for finance and governance. These can be incredibly empowering, especially for people who have limited access to financial services.The lack of financial inclusion is not a ""bug"" of the traditional financial system. It's a direct result of the regulatory architecture and the intermediaries policies.An increasingly global world needs neutral, open and borderless finance and governance systems. Open public blockchains will provide those, even against the extreme discomfort, opposition and interference of nation states and corporations. The world needs this too much and the technology itself cannot be un-invented or stopped."

over fake bitcoin ads — and, despite Facebook's efforts to eliminate the ...","Jun 8, 2019","Earlier this week, Dutch billionaire John De Mol launched a lawsuit against Facebook over crypto ads using his image without permission.","De Mol claims that consumers have lost as much as 1.7 million euros (over $1.9 million) due to the ads, and his reputation was damaged as a result.It is not the first time the California-based media giant is being sued over fake bitcoin ads — and, despite Facebook’s efforts to eliminate the problem, it seems that the issue persists.In January 2018, Facebook became the first major social media platform to ban cryptocurrency-related ads.Notably, the social media giant set a precedent for other big tech companies, including Google and Twitter, which soon followed suit and introduced similar regulations on their platforms.Specifically, Facebook declared at the time that it would prohibit ads that use “misleading or deceptive promotional practices,” referring specifically to initial coin offerings (ICOs) and cryptocurrencies. Rob Leathern, product management director at Facebook, explained the company’s decision in a blog post:“We want people to continue to discover and learn about new products and services through Facebook ads without fear of scams or deception. That said, there are many companies who are advertising binary options, ICOs and cryptocurrencies that are not currently operating in good faith.”The ban was “intentionally broad,” meaning that the social media company decided to ban all cryptocurrency ads on its platforms (namely Facebook, Instagram and Audience networks) first, and then learn how to select the ones that are actually “deceptive.” However, Leathern also mentioned that the company intended to “revisit this policy and how we enforce it.”Read more on this: Facebook Revises Policy on Blockchain Ads, Crypto-Related MaterialsIndeed, in June 2018, Facebook partly reversed the ban, once again allowing cryptocurrency ads on its platform — however, only from preapproved parties this time. The ban on ICOs, however, was kept in full effect. Hence, Facebook's revised ""prohibited products and services” policy states:“Starting June 26, we’ll be updating our policy to allow ads that promote cryptocurrency and related content from pre-approved advertisers. But we’ll continue to prohibit ads that promote binary options and initial coin offerings.”Further, the updated policy requires advertisers to submit an application beforehand so that Facebook can see if they are fit to run crypto-related ads. Specifically, candidates have been advised to include “any licenses they have obtained, whether they are traded on a public stock exchange, and other relevant public background on their business.”Ultimately, Facebook stated that “not everyone who wants to advertise will be able to do so.”Despite the extra measures from Facebook, it appears that fraud-related crypto ads still manage to find their way to the platform — as a result, the social media giant is now in the midst of a major lawsuit.The case was filed by John De Mol, a 64 year-old Dutch entertainment mogul whose net worth is estimated to be $1.7 billion.It is not the first time De Mol, who is affiliated with international TV hits including “The Voice,” ""Deal or No Deal,"" ""Fear Factor"" and ""Big Brother,” has brought up Facebook bitcoin ads that capitalize on his image. He first encountered the problem in October 2018, as Jacqueline Schaap, a lawyer from De Mol’s legal team, told Cointelegraph via email:“John de Mol noticed the ads for the first time in October 2018, we do not know whether these were the first adds to appear. We just have not noticed them before, but that does not mean that they have not been published.”At the time, he issued a public statement, saying that none of these ads had been given permission to use his name or image. Specifically, as per De Telegraf’s report, people were asked to transfer money to a company called Bitcoin Profit, which claimed to be backed by De Mol. The ad had reportedly been deleted by the time that article was published.Now, De Mol is suing Facebook before the Amsterdam District Court, as the problem is still urgent for the media tycoon. According to court documents obtained by Cointelegraph, the ads featuring De Mol’s images promoted cryptocurrency scams on Facebook and Instagram, which allegedly damaged his reputation.The plaintiff is accusing Facebook of failing to avert the ads and not being able to respond to the complaints on time. Moreover, De Mol’s lawyers asked Facebook to hand over identifying data about the people who create such advertisements.Further, De Mol’s legal team claims that consumers have lost as much as 1.7 million euros (over $1.9 million) due to the ads, also noting that a number of other Dutch celebrities have been targeted. Schaap told Cointelegraph that the figure was produced from “several newspaper/internet articles” and that it has been mentioned by Fraudedesk, a local organization that raises public awareness about fraudulent activities.A representative from Fraudedesk confirmed to Cointelegraph that the 1.7 million euros is the amount that has been reported to them by almost 200 people who engaged with the fake ads since 2017. The organization’s spokesperson wrote via email:“Generally only 10% is reported to us, so this amount is just the tip of the iceberg,”In a Reuters report, Schaap is quoted as saying that Facebook is responsible for such incidents, and that the current vetting process is not enough: “I don’t know what reality Facebook lives in, but that doesn’t work.”In response, Facebook lawyer Jens van den Brink reportedly stated that the social media company could not be forced to monitor all ads on its platforms at all times, and that Facebook had removed the De Mol-linked ads promptly after being informed about the complaints.Read more on this: Facebook’s Crypto Ad Ban Reversal Power Play Gets Their Own News StuckAs per Reuters, when asked by the judge whether Facebook’s vetting includes checking the content of websites that advertisements link to, Van den Brink replied positively, but noted that the company's software can be tricked by advertisers who change links in their ads or disguise the content of those pages. The lawyer also said that Facebook was trying to fix that problem.Prior to the hearing, Facebook’s Leathern told reporters the company was actively trying to prevent fraudulent ads:“The people who push these kinds of ads are persistent, they are well-funded and they are constantly evolving their deceptive tactics to get around our systems,”The outcome of this case is not clear at this point. According to Reuters, the judge mentioned that the two sides might be able to reach a settlement.Cointelegraph reached out to Van den Brink and Facebook for further comment, but neither of them replied to requests.Evidently, De Mol is not the only celebrity who has been targeted by deceptive crypto-related ads on social media. On Twitter, numerous users and bots have been impersonating celebrities like Elon Musk and Vitalik Buterin to promote cryptocurrency giveaways scams.On Facebook, the fraudsters’ tactic seems different. Instead of promoting giveaways, they mostly appear to describe “big” investment opportunities in nonexistent cryptocurrencies.To give the appearance of legitimacy, such ads feature fake celebrity endorsement and replicate popular media websites like CNBC or Daily Mail. Ultimately, they trick unknowing users into giving up sensitive data, such as their credit card information. During their research on the matter, the publication The Next Web had detected at least two pages that massively used this strategy, both of which were reportedly registered from Bulgaria.Although the Dutch entertainment magnate seems to be one of the very few public figures to take the fight over bitcoin ads to court, he is not the first one to do so.In April 2018, Martin Lewis, a British journalist and TV presenter who created Money Saving Expert, a popular financial advice website, sued Facebook for defamation over fraudulent ads featuring his name. Specifically, he argued that crooks were using his reputation to trick people into bitcoin ""get-rich-quick schemes"" on the social media platform.""The impact on people’s mental health of losing their retirement funds, or losing their children's money that they thought they were investing is catastrophic and life-destructive,"" he told Business Insider. Lewis also mentioned that he had been contacted by a person who had allegedly lost 19,000 British pounds ($25,000) because of a bitcoin ad featuring his face as well as a woman from Scotland who had been scammed out of 150,000 British pounds ($195,000) in a similar way.To reach an agreement with Facebook out of court, Lewis requested an apology and a ""manifest substantial change"" in the way the company deals with fake ads, particularly the ones capitalizing on public figures. The TV presenter reportedly said that if he wins the lawsuit, he will donate any damages he is awarded to charity.In January 2019, Lewis and Facebook came to an agreement after the social media giant announced it was donating 3 million British pounds ($4 million) to Citizens Advice — a United Kingdom-based network of charities — to launch a new project that would educate people about frauds and provide guidance for victims or potential victims.Moreover, Facebook said it was going to create a new button for its U.K. users that will allow them to report potential scam ads, which would subsequently be reviewed by “a new dedicated team” at Facebook. The company’s regional director for Northern Europe, Steve Hatch, mentioned that if the tools prove to be effective, they could be introduced in more countries.Lewis said that he was happy with the outcome and preferred it to facing Facebook in court, where he believes he could have won 50,000 to 100,000 British pounds ($63,500-$127,000). He also mentioned that the problem was not limited just to Facebook, since other platforms like Google and Yahoo had similar issues.It is unclear how Facebook and other big tech companies aim to deal with fraudulent cryptocurrency ads in the future, but for now, the problem persists, dealing damage to common users and stigmatizing the crypto industry.Lewis, for instance, suggested that Facebook should rely on manual labor because the technology has been failing to sweep away fake ads entirely:""No one says that a technology company can only have technological solutions. If you can't do it with technology, you know what you have to do, is you have to cut your profits and do it manually,""However, Facebook might have something else up its sleeve: In April last year, Mike Schroepfer, Facebook's chief technology officer, mentioned that the social media giant plans to use facial recognition to help stamp out scam ads, but admitted that it is ""challenging to do technically at scale."""

Aksakov stated:“I note that any operations with cryptocurrency that are contrary to the Russian legislation will be considered illegitimate. This means that mining, organizing issuance, circulation, creating exchange points for these tools will be prohibited. Administrative liability in the form of a fine will be incurred for such actions. We believe that cryptocurrencies created on open blockchains such as bitcoins, ethers, and others are illegitimate tools.”Aksakov, however, stressed that despite the mining ban in Russia, it is still possible to own bitcoin (BTC) if it was acquired under foreign law at foreign sale and exchange points.He also suggested that a mainstream interest in bitcoin could appear again once the speed of transactions increases.Russia’s major crypto bill, “On Digital Financial Assets,” had been approved by the Russian parliament in May 2018, but was subsequently sent back to the first reading stage after reports of its lack of major key concepts such as crypto mining, cryptocurrencies, and tokens.Russia has since further postponed the adoption of the crypto legislation due to a requirement from the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF) concerning the addition of the crypto-related terms.Earlier in June, Lyudmila Novoselova, chairman at the Court for Intellectual Rights of Russian Federation and a judge at the Supreme Arbitration Court, had also argued that the term digital assets should be included in the Russian Civil Law."

The news was reported by local English language newspaper The Philippine Star on June 10.","In addition to Diokno’s remarks, BSP Deputy Governor Diwa Guinigundo reportedly provided further insights into the institution’s stance toward cryptocurrencies during the launch of an unnamed book about bitcoin (BTC).Diokno ostensibly criticized bitcoin’s potential to function as a unit of account, medium of exchange and store of value, claiming that the top cryptocurrency’s volatility inhibits its usefulness on all three points.The governor reportedly recognized that blockchain and certain implementations of distributed ledger technologies can be useful for payments and settlements for peer-to-peer transactions, presenting this as a potential risk to the traditional banking sector:“Game theory dictates possible dysfunction when there is market breakdown, when everyone may distrust one another. There cannot be a total disregard for a central bank or a third party that provides lender of last resort facility.”Guinigundo said the central bank would approach fintech development using regulatory sandboxes in order to balance the prospective benefits of innovative financial technologies with robust consumer and investor protection.The Philippine Star cites fresh data from BSP’s Technology Risk and Innovation Supervision Department, which has reportedly revealed that the value of cryptocurrency transactions almost doubled in 2018 — hitting $390.37 million as compared with $189.18 million in 2017.The data breakdown indicated that conversion from fiat currencies into cryptocurrencies accounted for $208.27 million, crypto-fiat conversion for  $173.33 million, and crypto-enabled international incoming remittances for $8.77 million.In February of this year, the Philippines introduced a new set of rules governing the issuance and acquisition of utility and security tokens.BSP has required domestic crypto exchanges to register as remittance and transfer companies and implement specific safeguards — covering AML, CFT, risk management and consumer protection — since February 2017.Earlier this month, BitMEX Ventures invested in a crypto exchange officially licensed by BSP, and in April, payment services firm Bitspark revealed plans to release a cryptocurrency pegged to the Philippines’ national fiat currency, the peso."

The news was revealed in court documents filed on April 16.,"The twins, who founded crypto exchange Gemini, had accused Shrem of stealing 5,000 bitcoin (worth about $26.1 million at press time) and using the crypto to buy Maseratis, powerboats and other luxury goods. He denied the allegations, which dated back to 2012.Attorneys for both parties have signed the document filed with a federal court in New York, which says the entire civil action is being voluntarily dismissed with prejudice. It adds that the Winklevoss Capital Fund and Shrem will pay their own legal costs and fees, concluding: “The case will not be reopened.”In an earlier court document filed on April 5, reviewed by Cointelegrpah, both parties confirmed that they had reached a settlement. At the time, they were given 30 days to “fully effectuate” their agreement, with an option of proceeding to trial if it was not fulfilled.Following the case’s dismissal, Shrem told Cointelegraph in a statement today:“From day one, I’ve maintained the allegations are bogus, and they are of course. After their attorney was sanctioned and they were ordered to pay my legal fees twice, we recently reached a confidential resolution, and I’m dismissed from the case.”“I’m thankful for Brian Klein and my legal team and pleased to have this case behind me,” he added.The legal firm representing the Winklevoss twins has not replied to Cointelegraph’s request for comment by press time.As previously reported, a judge had ordered the Winklevoss brothers to pay Shrem $45,000 after the District Court of the Southern District of New York reduced the scope of the twins’ claims."

Such listed sites hawk illicit goods, such as drugs, weapons, or stolen credit cards, the police alleged.In a second tweet, the announcement continued to outline that:“The owners of the site raked in millions of dollars through an ‘affiliate marketing’ method, thereby earning from every sale done through them. The payment for the transactions was carried out using bitcoin. The 2 suspects arrested in Israel will be brought before a judge for a hearing regarding their potential detention extension.”While Israeli police confirmed the arrest of two individuals in their 30s in the local cities of Tel Aviv and Ashdod, Israeli newspaper JPost and technology media outlet Tech Crunch reported that further related arrests have also been made by cross-border investigators in France, Germany, the Netherlands and even Brazil.As reported, darknet marketplaces are accessed using services such as the Tor browser, which uses so-called onion routing — a technology for anonymous information exchange — so that users can remain concealed and circumnavigate censorship by disguising their IP-address.The Deep Dot Web arrests follow a joint operation by the German police and Europol last week to take down the dark web marketplace Wall Street Market. The action resulted in the seizure of millions in cash, reported six figure amounts in cryptocurrencies, and other assets, as well as the arrest of three German citizens.While cryptocurrency and its history of usage in darknet dealings became notorious in the aftermath of the closure of the illicit marketplace Silk Road, a two-year study of the dark web ecosystem — published in February 2018 — claimed that bitcoin may be losing its cachet as the number one currency on darknet markets, reportedly due to users’ frustrations with network traffic and transaction fees."

The views expressed here are her own and do not necessarily represent the views of Cointelegraph. This article contains spoilers.The irony of a book about the Winklevoss twins’ journey into cryptocurrency — which stresses over and over again how important it has been to their legacy to eclipse their past dealings with Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg — getting published less than a month before Facebook’s secretive cryptocurrency project was unveiled to the world is almost too obvious a way to begin this book review.“Bitcoin Billionaires: A True Story of Genius, Betrayal, and Redemption” is the latest book in a series of flashy exposés of some of the world’s biggest financial success stories from writer Ben Mezrich. Most well-known as the man that penned the book behind “The Social Network,” a movie that brought the Winklevii into the millennial zeitgeist as two tall, overly handsome, not-so-lovable Men of Harvard, Mezrich’s latest book explores the beginning of Facebook from the perspective of these mirror twins all the way through the making of their own billions in crypto.However, the story behind the all-hail Mark Zuckerberg movie, “The Accidental Billionaires: The Founding of Facebook, A Tale of Sex, Money, Genius, and Betrayal,” shares a lot more than just a title full of billionaires, genius and betrayal — it now shares cryptocurrency.Going back to the start, before this week when Facebook’s Libra project blew up both crypto and mainstream media, the Winklevoss twins were (and still are) arguably two of the biggest names in cryptocurrency. As a managing editor of a crypto publication, I’d been trained to look out whenever either of the twins said or did anything, as even a tweet of 120 characters from a Winklevii could get a story a high number of views.Mezrich’s story gave me a new perspective on this Winklevoss celebrité: Apparently, before they became two of the kings of crypto, they were the black sheep of Silicon Valley. After the drawn-out court case between the twins and Zuckerberg over their right to a small part of Facebook due to their arguably initial idea that inspired Zuckerberg to create the global social network, Silicon Valley apparently cut the twins loose.The way Mezrich writes it, these two newfound millionaires (who had insisted on taking part of their settlement in Facebook stock, an idea that is portrayed as over-exaggeratedly opposed by their lawyers at the time) just could not give their money away. Their pariah status comes to a head in a well-known-ish diner in the valley, when a visibly nervous potential startup founder rejects their money after a previous acceptance, appears scared to be seen with them (although this attitude begs the question, why had he agreed to meet the two very tall, large investors in such a public place?), and explains to them in much overwrought, sweaty detail why their money will never be welcome in Zuckerberg’s Silicon Valley.While this particular conversation with this degree of specificity may or may not have taken place, Mezrich’s point is clear: The Winklevii were not welcome in Silicon Valley.The rest of the book flies by their introduction to Bitcoin for the first time (in a club in Ibiza) —“‘Cryptocurrency,’ Cameron repeated, from his daybed. ‘It sounds criminal. Is it legal?’”— to their fateful first meetings with Charlie Shrem —“Cameron couldn’t help feel the nervous energy bleeding out of the kid — Charlie was actually trembling — or smell the hint of marijuana seeping from his plaid short-sleeve shirt and distressed khaki pants.”— the mutual intense dislike between them and “Bitcoin Jesus” Roger Ver —“As far as Ver was concerned, the Winklevoss twins, celluloid ‘Men of Harvard,’ were the Establishment’s wet dream.”— and the eventual investment in both Shrem’s now-defunct BitInstant and bitcoin (BTC) itself, leaving the twins with 1% of the crypto’s entire supply.Shrem, at this point, has become a major, manic character in both the book and the twins’ life. The book describes their relationship as being on friendly grounds for the majority of their connection to each other, although each time Charlie is introduced, his adjectives become more childlike and a bit more dismissive, up to the point that he is sometimes alluded to as the CEO of his favorite nightclub rather than of BitInstant.By the time that Shrem is jailed, which coincides with the New York State Department of Financial Services’ infamous cryptocurrency hearings with the now-hated Ben Lawsky (the anti-crypto-legislator-turned-entrepreneur who advises New York crypto firms on how to follow the confusing laws he himself created), the twins have written Shrem off as a bad investment.It would be interesting to see how Shrem has reacted to his characterization here, but he’s left me unread on Telegram since November 2018, when I texted him for comments about the Winklevoss’ now-settled lawsuit against him for theft of 5,000 bitcoin around this same time (which, for some reason, was not covered in Mezrich’s book).Bitcoin Jesus Roger Ver is brought in by Mezrich in the role of Charlie’s best friend, mentor and antithesis to the Winklevoss twins. The Winklevii hate him, Mezrich makes that abundantly clear — to the extent that they will never meet with him in-person throughout most of the book.This seems to be a rather extreme reaction as investors in a common project that has a relatively incomptentant CEO that they both know well, but Mezrich paints over their strange inability to even have a normal business conversation with Ver by portraying this Jesus character as what your mom would call a “very bad influence that you shouldn’t play with.” And thus, the Winklevii will not play with him.The move from the Winklevoss twins owning bitcoin to starting a cryptocurrency exchange is explained very quickly, but the point behind the idea has been hammered into the reader’s head the entire book: The Winklevoss twins really, truly love regulation. And what better way is there to ensure regulation in the crypto space than to create an exchange, base the business in New York (the state with the most stringent crypto laws) and then make sure people regulate it?And this is what the Winklevii have done. They started Gemini Trust LLC, which is regulated by the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS),and they were the first to get the SEC rolling on whether or not to accept a bitcoin exchange-traded fund.Back to the book, up to almost the present day, the ending trails off with an almost-unidentified man (surprise! it’s Mark Zuckerberg!) penning a ridiculous letter in January 2018 about his marathoning, Mandarin skills and newfound interest in cryptocurrency.But this book’s author could not have predicted that more than a year later, when the book came out, Zuckerberg’s over-the-top Christmas missive would lead to a media frenzy surrounding the Libra Association, libra stablecoin, Libra Investor Token, and the list goes on.All of this makes the similar titles of Mezrich’s books a bittersweet joke, especially when juxtaposed with the scene in the book in which the Winklevii are pleased that crypto-focused New York Times journalist Nathaniel Popper doesn’t use the word “Facebook” in the headline of his second article about the twins and crypto. Zuckerberg has definitely caught up to them in the crypto space célébrité, even though his project has been met with a significant amount of scorn over its decentralization — or lack thereof.And to add insult to injury — depending on your opinion of Zuckerberg’s pettiness (mine was amplified by a very early scene in the book wherein the Facebook mogul insisted on only meeting with one twin during a mediation due to an apparent fear of being punched) — libra stablecoin, gemini dollar… can anyone here read a horoscope?"

The Office told the Financial Times:“In a case in which a work is registered under a pseudonym, the Copyright Office does not investigate whether there is a provable connection between the claimant and the pseudonymous author.”Moreover, the registering the source code does not protect the intellectual property of bitcoin as an invention.The Copyright Office can cancel a registration application if it is certain that presented information is a false claim and the person claiming to be the author of a work is in actual fact not who they claim they are.Recently, a scandal around bitcoin SV (BSV) — the altcoin backed by Wright —  placed Wright  at the center of international attention when cryptocurrency exchanges began delisting the coin amid Wright’s campaign to deanonymize one of his critics, so called Hodlonaut.Hodlonaut targeted the Australian businessman with offensive tweets, calling him “a very sad and pathetic scammer.

announced that it recruited former Google product director Steve Lee.","Jun 13, 2019",United States-based bitcoin (BTC)-supporting payments service Square Crypto announced that it recruited former Google product director Steve Lee in a tweet published on June 12.,"Square Crypto was announced in March of this year when the organization joined Twitter, and planned to hire crypto engineers and designers to work on the bitcoin and crypto ecosystem, paying them in cryptocurrency.Just hours before announcing Lee’s recruitment, the official Twitter Square Crypto account asked — in what appeared to be a joke — the community to welcome the company’s “summer intern and inaugural hire, Gary Fuches.” Then, the author of the next tweet claimed to be Fuches and noted his commitment to blockchain technology:“Hello everybody! My name's Gary and I'm here to say, I love blockchain in a very big way!!!”A significant portion of the respondents reacted by correcting him and noting that he should have said bitcoin, instead of blockchain. One hour later, the management announced the hiring of Steve Lee in another tweet:“Hey guys. Management again. Unfortunately, things didn't work out with Gary. However, we think we've found somebody who can live up to his commitment to decentralization. Please welcome Steve Lee, aka @moneyball, to the Square Crypto team.”As the next — and last — tweet sent by the account notes, Lee is a former product director at Google, an angel investor and a volunteer project manager for bitcoin development. His LinkedIn profile further notes that he has also been a software engineer at technology giant IBM and a product manager intern at Yahoo. Lee, as some members of the community did in response to Gary’s alleged tweet, noted:“Bitcoin, not blockchain. Very excited about this opportunity!”As Cointelegraph reported at the beginning of May, Square saw a new revenue high from bitcoin sales through its Cash app, while profits from bitcoin sales remained low.In February, Twitter co-founder and CEO Jack Dorsey — also the founder and CEO of Square — said that rolling out the Lightning Network on Square’s Cash App is a question of “when, not if.”"

The article also notes that Facebook reportedly spoke with the Gemini exchange, which was founded by the Winklevoss twins, the well-known rivals of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg.According to the anonymous sources, Facebook has been conducting negotiations with major crypto-related firms in order to ensure that its long-rumored stablecoin is pegged to the value of the United States dollar and is liquid, tradeable and secure.Other firms reportedly included Chicago’s leading high-frequency trading firms Jump and DRW, the report says.All the parties mentioned above have declined to comment on the matter to the FT, with the report adding that the social media giant has required them to sign non-disclosure agreements.While the BBC has recently reported that Facebook’s upcoming cryptocurrency will be focused on payments, the sources reportedly revealed that Globalcoin will be “bigger and more open” than just a payment method for purchases on Facebook. As previously reported, Facebook allegedly plans to integrate its three fully-owned applications — WhatsApp, Messenger and Instagram — to deliver its massively exposed cryptocurrency project.According to the FT, industry experts claim that regulation will be Facebook’s biggest obstacle in delivering its own cryptocurrency.On May 2, Facebook registered a new financial tech firm, Libra Networks LLC, in Geneva, which notably plans to offer services in finance and emerging technologies including payments, financing, identity management, data analysis, big data, blockchain and others.Earlier in April, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss came to an agreement with bitcoin (BTC) entrepreneur Charlie Shrem to end a lawsuit the twins filed against Shrem last year. The brothers had previously accused Shrem of stealing 5,000 bitcoin (worth about $40 million at press time)."

Bitcoin ETF applications.” Traditional cryptocurrency exchanges and ...","May 20, 2019","Registered custodial services, which are common in traditional investment classes, have been on the rise in the digital asset sphere, including for cryptocurrencies.","Branding China Group (BC Group) has recently unveiled its plans for an insured custody service specifically for cryptocurrencies. A conglomerate with a diversified portfolio of blockchain-focused businesses in marketing communications and technology, believes its custody service removes one of the key barriers that have prevented professional traders and institutions from adding digital assets to their portfolios to date.Leading United States crypto exchange and wallet provider Coinbase launched its custody services for institutional investors in July 2018. In an apparent effort to expand on these services, Coinbase is currently in advanced negotiations to buy custody provider Xapo, one of the largest custodians of bitcoin in the world, in a deal reported to be worth $50 million.Crypto hardware wallet producer Ledger partnered with a Hong Kong trust company, Legacy Trust, to offer insured cryptocurrency custody services.A number of regulated financial institutions have also opened up digital custodial services, including Kingdom Trust, Germany's second-largest stock exchange Börse Stuttgart, Swiss private investment bank Vontobel, and major investment management company Fidelity.Private investors typically have their crypto stored in an exchange wallet, an online digital wallet or an offline hardware wallet. For institutional investors, these storage options are too risky and put too much responsibility on the investors themselves to ensure that the large amounts of funds are stored securely.Insured cryptocurrency custody services, much like traditional investment custody services, are third-party providers of storage and security facilities with the main purpose of safeguarding investor assets. These services are aimed specifically at institutional investors — such as hedge funds and other investment funds — and hold the digital assets on behalf of the investor in secure storage locations.Typically, the custodian would be a bank, trust or other regulated financial institution and would also insure investor funds up to a certain amount. However, because of the inherent perceived risk with cryptocurrencies, up until recently, there has been a lack of regulated, insured custodians for cryptocurrencies.The two main reasons are risk reduction and regulatory compliance.Typically, the amounts involved in institutional investments are much larger than with private investment. Uninsured online storage, such as exchange and other digital wallets, pose too much of a risk for institutional investors. And while offline, “cold” storage options — such as Trezor and Ledger — are deemed to be more secure, there’s a risk of forgetting passwords or physically losing the device.With a regulated custody service, the onus to keep funds secure will move from the investor to the specialized custodian. In addition, should anything go wrong, funds will also be insured. Although this does not completely eradicate the risk, it does put it an acceptably low level for institutional investors to enter the market.The second reason why institutional investors need custody services is to comply with regulation.Regulatory bodies around the world, such as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), and the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) require institutional investors to keep customer funds with a regulated custodian. Regulated custodians include banks, savings associations and registered broker-dealers.In referencing the SEC’s rejection of the Winklevoss twins Bitcoin ETF, Hugo May, an investment analyst at crypto investment firm Invictus Capital, highlighted the importance of insured custody services for regulatory compliance:“One of the most important regulatory requirements is sufficient custody solutions. The topic has been a very prominent talking point by the SEC in regards to Bitcoin ETF applications.”Traditional cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets do not necessarily meet these criteria and are not viable options for institutional investors to trade and store customer funds on.Kara Kennedy, custody product manager at Bank of New York (BNY) Mellon, said in a research article that, although there is an increasing demand in the market for a traditional, established custodian to provide custody of cryptocurrencies, there are some significant hurdles that must be overcome if traditional custody banks are to engage with this emerging asset class. These hurdles include operating models, technology, risk, compliance, and legal and regulatory frameworks. According to Kennedy:“Given the market interest, custodians should be considering their capabilities in relation to cryptocurrency servicing; but in order to advance, the industry will have to collectively overcome the issues and uncertainties which remain outstanding.”Whether or not mainstream institutional investment will embrace the cryptocurrency market has long been a debate.But analysts and cryptocurrency commentators agree that a lack of regulated custody services is one of the main reasons institutional investors are still reluctant to enter the market.In an interview with Investing.com, Jae Choi — CEO of blockchain-focused crowdfunding platform Pledgecamp — said one of the key missing pieces of safeguarding crypto assets has been a custodian service:“If you want cryptocurrency to be treated as a traditional asset, you need to offer regulation and custody options that resemble those available for traditional financial instruments or models.”Blake Estes, co-leader of blockchain and distributed ledger technology (DLT) at Alston & Bird LLP, said:""For chief investment officers, there's only downside risk in cryptocurrency. It would take a leap of faith with a new custodian with no brand recognition. That presents a real risk for them.""But with the rise in regulated custodians, this might change.In January, Cointelegraph reported on a survey done by market research company PollRight, which showed a 41% increase expected in institutional investment in the next five years. And in February, pensions and endowment consultancy, Cambridge Associates, said that cryptocurrency represents a sound investment for institutional investors, according to a Bloomberg report.An analyst at the Boston-based consultancy said:“Despite the challenges, we believe that it is worthwhile for investors to begin exploring this area today with an eye toward the long term.’’Although it would be impossible to predict the exact impact of an institutional influx into crypto, the overall consensus seems to be that a boost of capital into the market will bring a significant increase in prices, but with greater stability.Blockchain and crypto-focused crowdfunding startup MediaShares’s CEO, Gene Massey, said in an interview:“Blackrock, Vanguard, State Street, and BNY Mellon are recognized as the largest institutional investors and if they adopt Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies, you will see massive new investments from retail.”In February, Galaxy Digital Holdings Ltd founder and renowned crypto bull Mike Novogratz said in an interview with Bloomberg:“Over the next six to 12 months you are going to see institutions put a small amount of their assets in digital currencies. A small amount of institutional assets is a lot of money.”According to Novogratz, that inflow will set the stage for a rally and should push bitcoin past the $8,000 mark in the short term.A report published in November 2018 by Big Four auditing and consulting firm KPMG argued that, for the cryptocurrency industry to reach its fullest potential, institutional investors must join it:“Institutional participation is required to facilitate scale and increase trust for this emerging economy.”"

When it comes to futures, traders may benefit from being able to buy or sell crypto at a preagreed-upon price on a fixed date in time. These contracts enable them to lock in the value and secure some uncertainty in an unpredictable market.They can also be useful from a speculation perspective, especially if a trader believes that the value of a cryptocurrency is going to rise or fall in future. However, derivatives are not without their risks. While traders are paid the price difference by a broker when their analysis is correct, they would have to compensate the broker if the asset’s value went the other way.One of the main challenges when dealing in crypto derivatives is making sure that prices on brokerage platforms is up to date.Liquid says that its new service, Liquid Infinity, has been specifically tailored to the needs of professional traders. The company’s platform enables traders to leverage their positions up to 100x, “maximizing their exposure with minimum upfront capital.”Mario Gomez Lozada, the chief product officer of Liquid, explained:“We are well-known for our advanced trading platform features geared towards pro traders, in particular our core margin product with up to 25x leverage.“Infinity will enable traders to amplify their risk-to-reward ratios with the existing risk management tools we have in place for our margin product, such as stop-loss orders and other advanced charting indicators.”Liquid says that Infinity is accessible through a “sophisticated user dashboard,” along with other features that include margin trading of up to 25x leverage for a range of other preselected crypto-fiat pairings.The Liquid platform — which is owned by Quoine, a company with offices in Japan, Singapore and Vietnam — says it offers secure cold wallet storage and Know Your Customer (KYC) compliance for both individual and corporate customers.According to the platform, the crypto derivatives offered by Liquid Infinity have the potential to be highly advantageous to market players.The company says that liquidity is essential for ensuring that digital assets can be bought and sold quickly and easily — and that liquid markets usually boast high numbers of buyers and sellers, ensuring there is supply and demand for transactions to take place.Liquid Infinity’s leveraged bitcoin CFD means that consumers can speculate on price movements without actually owning the cryptocurrency themselves. Through this product, traders have an opportunity to predict whether prices will rise or fall against the aforementioned U.S. dollarUSD and Japanese yen — and in some cases, they can capitalize on minor movements in value.Leveraging can help amplify the outcome of correct predictions, but this does present the risk of exacerbating losses if prices go against a trader’s original forecast.CFDs have long been a mainstay of more traditional financial marketplaces, used for shares and forex. However, their presence in the crypto world is quite new, and Liquid Infinity is one of the few players in the industry today, as many crypto exchanges don’t offer CFDs at present.Market players who are accustomed to trading CFDs in other sectors normally find adjusting to crypto quite straightforward, and Liquid says it has tried to make the registration process as quick and painless as possible.Liquid adds that its bitcoin CFD can be a powerful tool for crypto traders who are looking to diversify their portfolios — delivering short-term trades to complement their longer-term strategies.Disclaimer.

We expect the industry to go through a rapid period of institutionalisation and implementation of sound practices over the coming years.”Other industry sectors also paid a price during the so-called “Crypto Winter.” In particular, those associated with mining saw dramatic fluctuations in profitability as prices dropped, triggering staff cuts and downsizing.Last week, Canadian mining giant Hut 8 announced annual losses for 2018 totalling almost $140 million.Sharing the optimism for the future meanwhile was Bin Ren, CEO of digital asset managed Elwood, which co-managed the survey with PwC.“This broader interest from investors and regulators is undoubtedly a positive step towards digital assets being recognised as an asset class with true viability and longevity,” he commented."

talked about as viable alternatives for the country's international trade.","May 29, 2019",Iran’s plan to battle international sanctions through the use of a state-sponsored cryptocurrency has been brewing for over a year now.,"It’s been a viable and exciting option for a country that had been cut off from the global economic community up until 2015 and again in 2017, following a short reprieve after agreeing to dial down its nuclear energy program.Despite all of this, Iran is still grappling with international pressures, including a ban on the acquisition of United States dollars in the country. American regulators are also looking to block the use of cryptocurrency as an alternate means for trade in Iran.Iran has slowly changed its attitude toward cryptocurrencies over the past few years for a number of reasons.Up until the beginning of 2017 the trade and use of cryptocurrency was of little to no concern to the regulating authorities in the country. In fact, data from May 2018 suggests that there has long been a voracious appetite for crypto trading in the country.A major driving force for the adoption of crypto in the country was a decision in January 2017 to stop using the U.S. dollar in Iran. Driven by fresh travel bans imposed by the U.S. administration, the Iranian government looked to leverage the use of other stable currencies to continue foreign trade.It didn’t take long before bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies began being talked about as viable alternatives for the country’s international trade. A few months later, the Iranian government revealed plans to roll out the necessary infrastructure to nurture the use of bitcoin in the country.In the same breath, authorities hammered home the importance of imposing regulations to ensure that the use of cryptocurrencies remains above board in November 2017. The Central Bank of Iran (CBI) and related departments were already hard at work making sure that the use and supply of crypto in the country was being supervised.Just four months later, in February 2018, local press reported that the CBI had made a U-turn in its crypto-friendly approach by announcing plans to control and prevent usage of cryptocurrencies in the country.Less than a week later, news broke that the Iranian government was exploring the creation of a state-backed cryptocurrency. With that slowly simmering in the background, the CBI banned local banks and financial institutions from buying, selling or trading cryptocurrency in April 2018.The explanation given for the ban was based on fears around the use of cryptocurrencies for money laundering and financing terrorism. While it seemed a crippling blow to the crypto community in the country, a government minister revealed that a model for a domestic cryptocurrency had been developed at the end of April.The use of cryptocurrency to bypass international sanctions became more evident as reports surfaced that Iran and Russia were looking into the possibility of facilitating bilateral trade with the use of cryptocurrencies. The countries had begun engaging with each other to explore using cryptocurrency transactions as an alternative to the SWIFT interbank payment system — which Iran has had little or no access to due to the international sanctions.Foundations were laid over the following several months on the proposed state-run cryptocurrency, and the country announced that development was complete in August 2018. The plans were expected to be formally released once the CBI updated its stance on the industry.Around the same time, the U.S. reinstated sanctions on Iran, heightening the need for an alternative to facilitate trade with the global economic community.A month later, Iranian government departments agreed to recognize cryptocurrency mining as a legitimate industry, with a legislative framework still to be developed by the Iranian National Cyberspace Center.In January 2019, the CBI released a statement that cooled the fears of harsh sanctions toward the crypto sector in the country. The institution said it would consult crypto industry experts before finalizing new draft regulations for the sector.Perhaps more exciting was the revelation that Iran was in talks with a number of countries around the possibility of conducting transactions using cryptocurrencies. The list included Switzerland, South Africa, France, the United Kingdom, Russia, Austria, Germany and Bosnia.All of this was revealed during the annual conference on Electronic Banking and Payment Systems in Tehran. Nevertheless, Iran still has yet to unveil the full details of its proposed state-run cryptocurrency.While Iran’s state-run cryptocurrency still remains somewhat of a mystery, blockchain development has come to the fore in 2019. The CBI has begun work on a national blockchain project that promises to overhaul its banking and financial sector.The Borna platform is being developed by the Iranian Informatics and Services Corporation and blockchain solutions provider Areatak. The Borna platform will be built on the Hyperledger Fabric — IBM’s open-source enterprise blockchain solution.Unsurprisingly, parts of the international community have reacted negatively to Iran’s moves to explore and develop a state-run cryptocurrency. Exacerbating this point were reports of significant crypto investments made by Iranian’s in May last year.In August 2018, the U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) called on the global community to monitor the use of crypto in Iran as an illegitimate means of bypassing sanctions. In essence, FinCEN was advocating for the scrutiny of any and all crypto transactions coming from Iran using a variety of intelligence and surveillance tools.Following that, U.S. lawmakers went as far as introducing a bill looking to impart further sanctions on Iranian financial institutions as well as the development of its state-run cryptocurrency. The act would forbid transacting or dealing with any Iranian cryptocurrency, and sanctions would be imposed on any individual that does so.This narrative and the proposed actions follow the aggressive financial sanctions coming out of America toward Iran over the past few decades.As Iranians wait for clarity on the promised state-run cryptocurrency, local crypto users have been dealt another blow to their access to trading support. On May 24, popular cryptocurrency exchange LocalBitcoins announced a ban on users in Iran.The decision was primarily due to the exchange’s headquarters being located in Finland. In an effort to comply with financial regulations of the country, the exchange has had to cut off its user base in Iran.Cointelegraph reached out to Iranian-based developer Arame Bandari, who previously worked as a researcher at Iran Blockchain Labs, for some insight on the current crypto climate in Iran.Bandari explained that the last 18 months have been difficult for the Iranian economy due to the resumption of U.S. sanctions. As a result, the value of the rial, Iran’s national currency, has declined, and people have looked to secure their capital by investing in foreign currencies or alternatives like the cryptocurrencies.This is why LocalBitcoins’ move to end customer support in Iran is a big blow to the sector. As Bandari explained, the exchange saw booming activity in recent months from its Iranian users:“Localbitcoins is one of the most popular cryptocurrency trading platforms in Iran. According to Localbitcoins, in February during an eight week period of rapid growth, Iranians tripled their trade on its P2P platform. Nearly 34.56 billion IRR [$820,805] changed hands during the seven-day period, comprising the eighth strongest week on record when measured against fiat currency.”The platform was highly successful in Iran because of the variety of payment methods it offered to users. Given that Iranian’s don’t have access to international payment platforms like Visa and Mastercard, LocalBitcoins provided easy access to a global trading platform.According to Bandari, underground crypto trading became popular, but users had to trust buyers and sellers who they met through Telegram channels and the likes. LocalBitcoins provided a safer solution that reduced some of the risk.Despite the exchange imposing a fresh ban on Iranian crypto traders, Bandari was optimistic that other exchanges would come forward to provide continued support:“At this moment Iranians have access to LocalBitcoins through VPN [virtual private networks] which is very common in Iran. But I think this kind of restriction will cause a significant migration of Iranian traders to other platforms. We have been witnessed such a migration when Bittrex and Binance banned Iranians. This will be a great opportunity for newcomer exchanges to grab the Iranian exiled traders community.”With the support of LocalBitcoins coming to an end, Iranian crypto traders will have to find other cryptocurrency exchanges to service their needs.According to Bandari, the process is slightly more complicated due to the difficulty of converting Iranian rials into cryptocurrency. A popular way to do this is buying tether tokens (USDT) for rials through tether.land. From there, users can buy bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, then proceed to trade using Bittrex or Binance through the use of a VPN.Another source from Iran highlighted two more popular platforms that have stepped up to fill the void left by LocalBitcoins.Multisignature peer-to-peer (p2p) bitcoin exchange Hodl Hodl has been identified as a preferred alternative. The website has even provided a translation of its page into Iran’s dominant language, Farsi, and is offering discounted exchange fees up until mid-June this year. The website has also set up a dedicated Telegram group to communicate with Iranian users.Another p2p exchange, keepchange.io, also reached out directly to Iranian cryptocurrency users through a blog post on Medium. It is offering users its services, as well as the ability to migrate trading data from LocalBitcoins to the keepchange platforms. Users can also access a “lifetime” trade bonus for referring customers to the exchange.There has been a “gold” lining for cryptocurrency adoption in Iran over the past few months, following a move to develop a gold-backed cryptocurrency in the country.Four Iranian banks joined forces in February to spearhead the creation of PayMon — as the new token will be called. The project involves the Parsian Bank, the Bank Pasargad, Bank Melli Iran and Bank Mellat. Over-the-counter cryptocurrency exchange Iran Fara Bourse will list the cryptocurrency. It’s understood that 1 billion tokens will be sold in the initial release, which has yet to be confirmed.Amid the economic turmoil facing Iranians, the news is a welcome boon for cryptocurrency users in the country. Bandari told Cointelegraph that any viable and trustworthy blockchain-based cryptocurrency solution will provide much needed relief to Iran:“In my opinion, at this stage national any kind of coin or token can help to deal with national payment system or economic problems. In fact cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin can not be used as an alternative payment method for massive intergovernmental trades, but it can be used for small businesses or merchants to facilitate payments which foreign parties.”Given that Iran has been facing harsh economic sanctions from the global community for some time, concerted efforts to nurture blockchain technology, coupled with a cautious approach to cryptocurrency regulation, are setting an interesting precedent.While the everyday crypto user may face some tough times ahead when trying to go about daily trading, there seems to be a glimmer of hope that country will openly adopt and use blockchain technology."

This device is then used to obtain two-factor-authentication (2FA) codes which grant control over the victim’s online account.After describing in detail how the attack had been carried out, Coone noted his recommendations to prevent such attacks, including using a hardware wallet to secure personal cryptocurrency holdings and using a YubiKey for 2FA. In cases in which a YubiKey is not supported, he recommends using Google Voice 2FA, since he claims those numbers are not vulnerable to SIM swapping.Lastly, Coonce also suggests using a password manager and reducing a user’s personal online footprint by publicly sharing less personal information online. He stated that he “can’t stop thinking about the small, easy things I could have done to protect myself along the way,” and added:“Given my naive security practices, I probably deserved to get hacked.”As Cointelegraph reported earlier this month, United States blockchain and crypto investor Michael Terpin has won $75.8 million in a civil case against 21-year-old Nicholas Truglia, who reportedly defrauded him of crypto assets through SIM swapping.Also in May, the U.S. Department of Justice released a fifteen-count indictment charging a hacking group labeled “The Community” with SIM swapping in order to steal cryptocurrencies."

As the press release outlines:“Technologies for flare mitigation [...] are capable of handling the large-scale gas throughputs required by today’s North American shale industry. Crusoe’s technology harnesses otherwise wasted energy for growing industries that require energy intensive computing, such as blockchain and artificial intelligence.”The systems are said to be scalable to up to millions of cubic feet per day and deployable across North America. In an emailed statement to Bloomberg, Winklevoss Capital Sterling Witzke reportedly stated:“Crusoe Energy is in a unique position to reduce the cost of cloud computing and cryptocurrency mining. Their technology is a win-win for the environment, energy producers, and the digital economy.”According to Bloomberg’s interview with Crusoe co-founder Chase Lochmiller, the company is working with — undisclosed — large publicly traded oil and gas companies.As Cointelegraph has previously reported, the high energy consumption required by the mining of certain cryptocurrencies has sparked intense debate within the crypto community and beyond.In late summer 2018, a clean energy expert hit back against the common perception that energy intensivity is in “Achilles Heel” for bitcoin (BTC), arguing that the debate needs to be reoriented to focus on the sources of electrical power, rather than consumption levels."

In this instance, the leaders of the network reportedly duped domestic and foreign clients into handing over around $30 million over several years.Cryptocurrency use is not illegal in Brazil, with the police taking pains to reiterate the impetus for the Indeal raid was the lack of legality behind its business.As Cointelegraph reported, Brazilian police had conducted another operation on a cryptocurrency drug ring in April."
199,https://cointelegraph.com,"Apr 15, 2019",5 Cryptocurrency Tax Questions to Ask on April 15th,https://cointelegraph.com/news/5-cryptocurrency-tax-questions-to-ask-on-april-15th,"The most common tax event from the above is trading one cryptocurrency for 
another — for example, trading your Bitcoin (BTC) for Ethereum ...","Apr 15, 2019","Depending on what country you live in, your cryptocurrency will be subject to different tax rules. The questions below address implications within the United States, but similar issues arise around the world. As always, check with a local tax professional to assess your own particular tax situation.","You need to report your cryptocurrency activity if you incurred a taxable event during the year. A taxable event is a specific scenario that triggers a tax liability. The below are a list of the taxable events as specified by the IRS 2014 guidance:The most common tax event from the above is trading one cryptocurrency for another — for example, trading your Bitcoin (BTC) for Ethereum (ETH).On the other hand, there are other actions that cryptocurrency enthusiasts also commonly take that are not taxable events and do not trigger a tax reporting requirement. Listed below are scenarios in which traders do not trigger a tax event:An exampleLet’s say you buy 2 BTC from Coinbase. You just hold this crypto for the year. In this case, you have no reporting requirement, as you have not triggered a taxable event. Even if you send this to an offline wallet, you still do not need to report this, as merely sending crypto from one place to another is not a taxable event.Now let’s say you send this 2 BTC to Binance and start trading it for other altcoins. Now you have incurred a taxable event (trading one cryptocurrency for another) and you will need to report this transaction on your taxes and file it with your 2018 tax return, even if you lost money on the trade.Keep in mind that mining cryptocurrency is also taxable and is treated as income.If you are simply buying, selling and trading cryptocurrencies you will report these trades on the IRS Form 8949, as pictured below.As seen in the above example, you have sold 0.5 Bitcoin. You acquired the Bitcoin on July 16, 2017, and you sold it on December 17, 2017. You sold the Bitcoin for a total proceed of $9,848.00, and your cost basis was $970.00. This led to your gain of $8,873.00 (reported in column h).You will report each crypto-to-crypto trade and each taxable event from the calendar year on this form.You can use crypto tax software to automatically build this report for you, if you don’t have your own records of the historical prices, dates and fair market values of your trades.Once you have your net gain or loss calculated from Form 8949, the total will simply flow into your 1040 Schedule D. You should include these forms with your entire tax return upon filing.Foreign account holdingsIf you traded on foreign exchanges like Binance, you may additionally need to report these holdings. You do not pay any tax on these holdings, but it is important that you file the following reports if either situation applies to you.FBAR: A taxpayer with a financial interest in or signatory authority over a foreign financial account must file a Foreign Bank Account Report (FBAR) FinCEN Form 114 if the aggregate value of the foreign financial account exceeds $10,000 at any time during the calendar year. Noncompliance with FBAR would subject a taxpayer to steep civil and criminal penalties. Each nonwillful failure-to-file violation can carry a civil penalty of $10,000. Penalties for each willful violation could be the greater of $100,000 or 50% of the amount in the account.FATCA: A taxpayer with foreign financial assets of $50,000 or more must report it under Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) requirements on Form 8938. It is recommended that cryptocurrency-invested hedge fund accounts and cryptocurrency-denominated exchange accounts be reported in the summary information in Part I of Form 8938. Specific information should be given in Part V. Noncompliance with FATCA could subject a taxpayer to taxes, severe penalties in excess of the unreported foreign assets, and exclusion from access to U.S. markets, which could include a regulated cryptocurrency derivatives clearing market.The reality is that no one knows for sure. However, it is not advised.The IRS publicly stated on July 2, 2018 that one of their core campaigns and focuses for the year is the taxation of virtual currencies. Unfortunately, lack of reporting will be treated as tax fraud.Yes.When you realize a capital gain — if you sold your crypto for more than you purchased it for — you owe a tax on the dollar amount of the gain. However, when you sell (or trade) your crypto for less than you purchased it for, you incur a capital loss, and you can use this loss to offset gains from other trades or even a gain from the sale of other property — like stocks in your portfolio.  Whenever your total capital gains and losses for the year add up to a negative number, you incur a net capital loss. If the net capital loss is less than or equal to $3,000 ($1,500 if you are married and filing a separate tax return), then that entire capital loss can be used to offset other types of income — like the income from your job.If your losses exceed $3,000, then the amount over $3,000 will be rolled forward to the next tax year.The bright spot in the 2018 bear market is that your losses can reduce your tax bill.Cryptocurrency exchanges are unable to provide their users with accurate tax documentation. This is a big problem in the industry.By the nature of the blockchain technology that exchanges operate on, users are able to send Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to wallet addresses outside of their own network. An example of this would look like you buying Bitcoin through Coinbase and then sending it to a Binance wallet address in order to acquire new coins and assets on Binance that Coinbase does not offer.Because you can send cryptocurrencies from other platforms onto exchanges like Coinbase at any time, Coinbase has no possible way of knowing how, when, where or at what cost you acquired that cryptocurrency that you sent in. Coinbase only sees that it showed up in your Coinbase wallet.This means that anytime you move crypto assets off of Coinbase or into Coinbase from another location, Coinbase completely loses the ability to provide you with accurate tax information. This is because it has no way of identifying what your cost basis is in that certain cryptocurrency, which is an essential piece to figure out your capital gain or loss. This is also true of all other major cryptocurrency exchanges.The solution to this problem is to leverage crypto tax aggregating tools to collect your data from all platforms to build your holistic tax reports.David Kemmerer is the co-founder of CryptoTrader.Tax, cryptocurrency-focused tax software for automating your tax reporting."

Kik CEO Ted Livingstone, also the founder of Kik’s crypto project the Kin Foundation (KIN), announced the formation of the Defend Crypto fund, which plans to legally challenge the SEC to get regulatory clarity surrounding the definition of securities in regard to cryptocurrencies. The fund will use major U.S. crypto exchange and wallet Coinbase’s custody service. The DefendCrypto campaign comes in the wake of the SEC’s actions against Kik’s $100 million initial coin offering (ICO) sale held in 2017, after which the regulator said that it had violated securities laws.Facebook’s payment-focused cryptocurrency, reportedly called GlobalCoin, could face demographic challenges, according to research from crypto analysis firm Diar. According to Diar, Facebook’s long-rumored native cryptocurrency that will reportedly launch in 2020, could face the aforementioned challenges due to the aging demographics of the social media giant’s user base. The older generation that uses Facebook reportedly does not have enough awareness about digital currencies, and Facebook’s younger user base purportedly is not wealthy enough to use the rumored coin in a significant way. Diar also noted that Facebook will need to enter into partnerships with traditional financial institutions.Bitcoin (BTC) has hit an all-time high versus the Argentine peso during the ongoing decline of the country’s national currency. According to the Financial Times, bitcoin’s price reached as high as 394,000 pesos ($8,801 at press time) per coin, which are prices that have not been seen since the crypto spike in late 2017. Bitcoin’s all-time high in Argentina comes during a crypto bull market this year, in conjunction with the ongoing depreciation of the Argentine peso against the U.S. dollar. In fact, earlier this year, venture capital billionaire Tim Draper had advised the president of Argentina to legalize bitcoin so that economic situation in the country could improve.According to a senior FBI official, U.S. sanctions incentivized North Korea to launch cyberattacks involving cryptocurrency. Tonya Ugoretz, deputy assistant director of the FBI’s cyber division, said at an event this week that the financial strain brought on by sanctions meant that North Korean state actors had turned to cybercrime as a way of bringing in money. Cointelegraph has previously reported that Pyongyang is suspected to be behind several major campaigns involving cryptocurrency ransomware and theft in recent years. Erin Joe, director of the Cyber Threat Intelligence Integration Center under the U.S. Director of National Intelligence, said at the same event that there is a “huge effort in the FBI, and also several other entities across government, looking at ways to stop malicious activity (surrounding) cryptocurrency.”Forbes reported this week that digital currency investment firm Dadiani Syndicate was reportedly approached by a wealthy client to buy as close to 25% of the bitcoin supply as possible. The firm, a peer-to-peer network where people trade with each other in crypto, made news last year when it put 49% of Andy Warhol’s 1980 work ""14 Small Electric Chairs"" up for sale for bitcoin and other digital currencies. This week, the firm’s founder said that ""one of our clients approached us and said they were interested in acquiring 25% of all bitcoin currently available. There are a number of entities who want to dominate the market."" However, Dadiani noted that acquiring a quarter of the current 17.7 million BTC supply would not be possible without significantly affecting the market.The crypto market is slightly down, with bitcoin at around $8,448, ether at $262 and XRP at $0.44.

Speaking in an interview with Bloomberg Markets: Asia, Chu said that bitcoin will continue its bullish direction in line with the rest of the crypto market in 2019 due to three factors: mass adoption by institutions like Facebook, JPMorgan, Rakuten and Fidelity, the crypto industry’s ability to become a “better tech story” about the Uber and Lyft IPOs, and the upcoming bitcoin halving.According to an investigation by security research Harry Denley of MyCrypto, online cryptocurrency paper wallet creator WalletGenerator.net previously ran on code that caused private/public key pairs to be issued to multiple users. The bad code was reportedly in effect by August 2018, and was only patched at the end of May of this year. After researching the live code for the website on GitHub, Denley concluded that there were differences between the code, finding that the keys were deterministically generated on the live version of the website, not randomly. After being contacted by Denley, WalletGenerator.net reportedly fixed the determinism problem, even though it purportedly said after that the allegations could not be verified, and even asked the correspondent if MyCrypto was a “phishing website.”Jens Weidmann, the president of Germany’s central bank, the Deutsche Bundesbank (BBk), has warned central banks about the potential risks of introducing digital currencies. Weidmann, who is the BBk president as well as chairman of the board of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), reportedly said that banks adopting digital money could potentially destabilize the financial system during periods of crisis. In his opinion, easy access to digital currencies could facilitate a collapse of lenders, and would even “fundamentally change the business model of banks” in a good economic environment. He also put forward the idea that easy access to digital money has the potential to lead to increased volatility.An analysis by international hacker and cybersecurity expert group Guardicore Labs has revealed that as many as 50,000 servers worldwide have allegedly been infected with an advanced cryptojacking malware. The malware in question mines privacy-focused, open-source cryptocurrency turtlecoin (TRTL). The campaign was first detected in April, with Guardicore Labs finding that the malware has infected up to 50,000 Windows MS-SQL and PHPMyAdmin servers over the past four months worldwide. The expert group states that the malware campaign is not the usual crypto-miner attack due to its reliance on techniques commonly seen in advanced persistent threat groups, including fake certificates and privilege escalation exploits.After the high-profile shutdown by Europol of one of the most well-known cryptocurrency mixers, Cointelegraph looks at the reasons behind the shutdown, as well as examines the scope and reality of the anonymity behind mixers themselves.As Iranian users lost access to popular online service LocalBitcoins, Cointelegraph dug more into the relationship that the country has with cryptocurrency, both from a state and citizen level.As the top cryptocurrency reached new yearly highs, before briefly dropping back down, Cointelegraph correspondent Joseph Young analyzes the market outlook."

purchase bitcoin using Singapore dollars during the “soft launch.”.","Apr 25, 2019",This article has been updated to include comments from Binance CEO Wei Zhou and to remove an inaccurate reference to Xfers offering a cryptocurrency wallet.,"Binance has launched a new cryptocurrency exchange in Singapore after months of anticipation, albeit with limited features, Binance CEO Wei Zhou told Cointelegraph on April 24.Users of the platform are only able to purchase bitcoin (BTC) using Singapore dollars (SGD,) meaning far fewer trading pairs are available for consumers compared with the company’s main exchange. Zhou noted that additional currencies will be added as regulations allow for it.The Binance Singapore website suggests that the service is being offered in conjunction with Xfers, a local payment service approved by Singaporean regulators. Three steps are listed for new customers: creating an account with Binance Singapore, linking their Xfers account, and beginning to buy and sell bitcoin as they wish.In a comment to Cointelegraph, ZHou said that Xfers and Binance are working together in order to build a key fiat gateway.Zhou also noted:“Our SGD fiat-to-crypto platform has full deposit and withdrawal functionality. During this early initiation of Binance Singapore, we encourage our Singaporean community to share feedback and relay any user-specific issues to our customer service team for support.”As Cointelegraph reported earlier in April, CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) had said Binance was planning to open the branch in Singapore at some point this month — but further details about the fiat-to-crypto exchange service were not forthcoming. Last September, he revealed that private beta testing for the service was about to begin.Vertex Ventures, a subsidiary of Temasek Holdings — an investment company based in Singapore and owned by the government — announced last October that it was investing in Binance to fuel its expansion to the country.At press time, Binance is the world’s second-largest crypto exchange by trading volume, according to CoinMarketCap.Also on April 23, the company announced it has launched its decentralized trading platform (DEX) ahead of schedule — one week after the native blockchain that will power it, Binance Chain, went live.Although Binance DEX trading is only going to be available to the public at a later date, a two-month testnet period has reportedly seen 8.5 million transactions run across a simulated trading environment."

Ministry's criticism of bitcoin as having a lack of intrinsic value. Prior 
to ...","May 8, 2019","A blow was struck to the crypto community in India in late April as reports circulated regarding a proposed ban on cryptocurrencies. India has a strong and passionate community of crypto enthusiasts, however, their steadfast belief in the value of cryptocurrency does not appeared to be mirrored in the diverse organs of the Indian state. Cointelegraph takes a deep dive into the latest developments in the Indian crypto sector and speaks to the experts determined to stick out this turbulent period for investors.","In a development set to further consolidate the Indian government’s reputation for a faltering approach toward cryptocurrency, rumors circulated in late April that various government divisions are considering tabling an absolute ban on crypto in all its forms, according to The Economic Times.The local publication reportedly contacted an official familiar with this latest attempt to ban cryptocurrency in the country. According to the official, the draft bill named “Banning Cryptocurrencies and Regulation of Official Digital Currencies Bill 2019” is currently being discussed by several ministers from a number of government divisions.Although the draft bill has yet to be written into law, it appears that it is already garnering support from various groups attached to the government. A committee formed of — but not limited to — the Department of Economic Affairs (DEA), the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT), the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC), along with the Investor Education and Protection Fund Authority (IEPFA) has allegedly aligned with the decision to outright ban the sale, purchase and the issuance of cryptocurrencies in all their forms.In addition to the 2019 draft bill, the committee is reportedly exploring options to ban digital currencies under the auspices of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).Despite the reporting conducted by The Economic Times, not all members of the crypto community are convinced that the ban is likely to take place at all. Mohammed Danish, a lawyer representing crypto-fraud victims in Indian courts and legal advisor to the crypto news content site Crypto Kanoon, notes that there has not yet been any official government statement regarding the alleged bill:“The discussion about banning crypto in India' finds its source in few news articles and the same has not been confirmed by any official press release till date. However, let's assume that the news is absolutely correct and the inter-governmental committee is inclined to propose a ban on Crypto. The Committee appears to have based its ban proposal mainly on two major grounds viz. 'money laundering' and 'investor protection.”Beyond the speculation enshrouding the very existence of the crypto ban bill, Danish elaborated that, even in the event that the bill does go through, it could end up being counterintuitive:“The committee is failing to appreciate that a law can only make the crypto-activity punishable but it can never control/stop the operation/use of Crypto given to its decentralized nature. It cannot be eradicated from the grey market. A law banning crypto would only help the miscreants as on one hand it will create a dark heaven for the miscreants to defraud and on the other hand the fraud victims will be seen as complicit due to which they will hesitate in seeking redressal even in case of genuine frauds. On the contrary, if the Govt. decides to regulate Crypto in some or the other way, it will at least have some control over the activity to stop the vices. It will also help in achieving financial goals.”The 2019 draft bill is the latest in a series of contradictory actions by the Indian government concerning cryptocurrencies in recent months. Thus, in December, at least two government committees came to diametrically opposed conclusions regarding the legalization and regulation of cryptocurrencies in India within just weeks of each other.One committee ruled that all cryptocurrencies should be legalized. An unnamed, yet senior official that attended the committee’s cryptocurrency panel said that crypto legalization is inevitable:“There is a general consensus that cryptocurrency cannot be dismissed as completely illegal. It needs to be legalized with strong riders.”Only a few weeks earlier, a separate government panel meeting put forward a new legal framework within the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) advocating for a total ban on cryptocurrencies, stating that “any kind of dealing in such currencies should be treated as ‘illegal.’”The Indian government allegedly set up the panel with the aim of establishing a series of “norms” for digital currencies. The committee was fronted by Secretary of the Department of Economic Affairs (DEA) Subhash Chandra Garg and submitted its findings in the form of a report to Indian Finance Minister Arun Jaitley.It’s also important to note that RBI executive director Ganesh Kumar took part in discussions with representatives from G-20 countries calling for the taxation and regulation of cryptocurrencies in order to minimize their use in illicit activity.Although the country has a chequered past regarding openness to cryptocurrencies, it could be argued that the debate regarding either banning or legalizing them began in earnest in April 2018, when the RBI announced its decision to sever ties with those dealing in cryptocurrencies.In the bank’s release entitled “Statement on Developmental and Regulatory Policies,” published on April 5, the RBI outlined its support for the technological innovations supporting cryptocurrencies as having “the potential to improve the efficiency and inclusiveness of the financial system. [...] Virtual Currencies (VCs) [...] raise concerns of consumer protection, market integrity and money laundering, among others.”Despite this initial glimpse of positivity, the RBI soon laid bare its animosity toward cryptocurrencies themselves, stating that it had issued warnings to individuals involved with the crypto industry about “various risks.” The bank further commented that it viewed the risks seriously enough to rescind their offer of services to involved individuals or businesses:“In view of the associated risks, it has been decided that, with immediate effect, entities regulated by RBI shall not deal with or provide services to any individual or business entities dealing with or settling VCs. Regulated entities which already provide such services shall exit the relationship within a specified time.”Speaking at a press conference on April 5, RBI Deputy Governor Bibhu Prasad Kanungo outlined his view that cryptocurrencies could potentially have the power to “endanger financial stability”:“Internationally, while the regulatory response to these tokens are not uniform, it is universally felt that they can seriously undermine the AML (anti-money laundering) and FATF (Financial Action Task Force) framework, adversely impact market integrity and capital control. And if they grow beyond a critical size, they can endanger financial stability as well.”CEO and co-founder of Indian Unocoin Sathvik Vishwanath told Cointelegraph that the RBI’s stance has had an adverse impact on both Indians and cryptocurrency usage:“The present stance of RBI has not only reduced the number of transactions that happening for buying and selling of cryptos but it also has hurt the sentiments of Indians. To get more adoption and acceptance of crypto, initially the government should first clear its stance about crypto followed by the lifting the banking ban for these transactions and finally coming up with the suitable regulations for both trading and payment systems of crypto.”In addition to the RBI’s damning comments regarding cryptocurrencies, the bank announced on Jan. 1 that it would pause its plans to develop and release a digital currency. Initially due for release in April of this year, the RBI confirmed in August that the digital currency would be backed by the rupee in an effort to combat the rising cost of printing paper and the popularity of digital coin usage.A report published by Indian business news outlet The Hindu Business Line quoted an unidentified source who said that the government had had a change of heart:“The government doesn’t want the digital currency any more. It thinks it is too early to even think about a digital currency.”Despite an unstable crypto environment in which any potential fintech advancement could help bring about wider adoption, not all members of the crypto community were on board with the digital currency initiative to begin with. The founder of local cryptocurrency exchange Belfrics, Praveen Kumar, said that now was not the time for the launch:“It is premature for RBI to launch crypto-rupee, as more understanding of the crypto economy need to be achieved. It is a right decision to delay the process and see how the publicly traded peer-to-peer economy is shaping up.””This was not the first instance in which India’s financial institutions made clear their aversions to cryptocurrencies, a prime example of this being the Indian Finance Ministry’s criticism of bitcoin as having a lack of intrinsic value. Prior to this, Indian banks began to limit the functionality of crypto exchange accounts. The atmosphere darkened for Indian crypto enthusiasts to the extent that false media rumors regarding a country-wide ban in early February 2018 led to a drop in crypto markets at the time.With the government’s indecision regarding cryptocurrencies ostensibly representing the most significant hurdle for adoption and usage in India, it appears that the quantity of theories seeking to explain the government’s position on crypto are as numerous as the committees set up to decide its fate.Sathvik Vishwanath told Cointelegraph that this hesitant approach is not atypical of the Indian government regarding new technology:“India is a conservative country. In the past it has only taken the stance of encouraging a technology after it being able to fully regulate. India also has the history of taking knee-jerk reaction when they’re not capable of understanding the pros and cons at hand. We hope crypto industry don’t become prey.”Evan Luthra, an entrepreneur and blockchain expert, outlined his view in an interview, saying to Cointelegraph that India’s large geographic size, bureaucracy and population all play a part in the shaping of the government’s inconsistent approach to regulating cryptocurrencies:“The problem with India and cryptocurrencies is that India is a billion people. It’s a lot of different states that are working with blockchain and cryptocurrency. There are different levels and there is the state government which is also responsible for setting out how the currencies are regulated and how cryptocurrencies are regulated in India.”Luthra also said that it’s important to note that crypto’s existing association with illegal activity is admittedly hard to shake off, though outweighed by the potential benefits that could be brought about in future: “While we see a lot of progress happening in India and multiple state governments pressing forward with blockchain and blockchain based solutions, India has also been the leader when it comes to scam projects. This is because every time an industry grows so fast, there is bound to be scams around it.“In a cash rich economy like india, cryptocurrency has the highest potential to make a big impact. But before we get to that level to see that positive impact, there are definitely going to be a few bad players. And to remove them there’s going to be a rollercoaster ride, involving many ups and downs. We’re going to have to wait for the government officials to understand this technology and these cryptocurrencies.”Although instances of crypto crime in India are well documented, Danish believes that the reputation of cryptocurrencies can weather the storm:“The fact that Crypto is packed with the power of decentralization, it is impossible for it to get rid of this ascription. However, it is pertinent to note that no law has been able to achieve 100% result ever. Despite having in place many strict laws, no crime has ever been extinguished completely. We have cases of murders despite Section 302 IPC prescribing life imprisonment for its commission. The best which can be done is to rein crypto in such a manner that the ease provided by it to the wrong doers can be curtailed considerably.”Although the government appears to be set on either finding a thorough method of regulating cryptocurrencies or banning them altogether, many members of the Indian crypto community are firm in their belief that, as understanding of the technology grows, adoption and acceptance is sure to follow. Thus, Evan Luthra says that, despite any regulatory measures, cryptocurrencies will survive, and it’s up to governments to decide which side of history they want to be on:“As they understand it better every day, regulation will change. As the regulation keeps changing, that will bring the volatility and the hostility that we see right now. The best way for the government to move forward is to accept that fact that cryptocurrencies are not going anywhere. Either they can join the bandwagon or they can be left aside and cryptocurrencies will survive, with or without the government anyways.”For Danish, education and awareness are the two key factors that will shift the current government impasse in India. Danish also explained that the imposition of a blanket ban on cryptocurrencies wouldn’t be a one-trick fix — as without education, members of the public would still be vulnerable to “crypto-crimes” and instances of fraud:“I think there is a need for running general awareness programs about Blockchain, Crypto and Crypto frauds. Illiterate and non-tech savvy people are more prone to fall prey to the ponzi schemes which falsely promise higher returns. I would emphasize that if at all the Govt. decides to ban it, it must make provision for Crypto education so that the people are capable of protecting themselves from the crypto-crimes and criminals in the post-ban era as both these things are going to survive the ban. A Crypto ban can only kill innovation but not the crypto-crime.”With the government’s track record of changing its attitude toward crypto several times in quick succession, it looks like crypto is set to have a complicated path toward acceptance in India, should it ever get to that point. With the upcoming general election set to conclude on May 23, India risks a completely new government and, potentially, a completely new approach to cryptocurrency. With mixed signals from the current government and the spectre of a potentially damning new bill lurking in the shadows, the future of crypto in India remains to be seen."

The smooth shift to Athens A indeed demonstrated the capability of Tezos to evolve without forking, thanks to the features of proposal/selection/voting/test/implementation this blockchain itself encompasses.On the very same day, another fast-growing young company backed by a cryptocurrency, Iota, announced an important step toward total decentralization, substituting its Coordinator mechanism with the new Coordicide tool.Coordicide will perform the same functions of its predecessor, ensuring transaction security and preventing double spending. However, the new protocol will allow the peculiar Iota block creation process to work in a fully decentralized and permissionless manner.The debate over what constitutes the most suitable approach to the exchange business and the declarations of some big companies about decentralized exchanges (DEX) — both for or against it — only add to the fact that the topic of decentralization is still a paramount concern as crypto involves more people and use cases.The evolution of cryptocurrencies as a business increases the amount of interest it generates. As in any business, this involves issues relating to power distribution. But such questions are difficult to answer in a simplistic way.Bitcoin (BTC) defines itself as a peer-to-peer (p2p) network, as per the title of its white paper; the new electronic cash would work in a trustless manner — the 2008's foundation document states — thanks to the consensus of the honest nodes that “control a majority of CPU power.""The dream of money created by the people and for the people, freely circulating across the national borders, and untouchable by the rapacious economic monopolies was very appealing during the years following a dramatic financial crisis, which some may argue left the world suspicious toward governments and traditional financial actors.However, while Bitcoin evolved from being a “cypherpunk” plaything to a relevant business entity, many concerns about its actual decentralization and “internal democracy” arose. In autumn 2016, for instance, two researchers — De Filippi from Harvard University and Loveluck from Université Paris-Saclay — published a paper that criticized the ""highly centralized and undemocratic"" technocratic approach to governance that, in their opinion, characterizes Bitcoin core developers.Defining the small number of individuals in charge to decide which changes shall be incorporated into Bitcoin as a sort of ""benevolent dictator,"" the two researchers noticed:""There exists, therefore, an obvious discrepancy between the libertarian vision of Bitcoin as a decentralised infrastructure that cannot be regulated by any third party institution, and the actual governance structure that dictates the technological development. [...] While the (a)political dimension of the former has been praised or at least acknowledged by many, the latter has remained, for a long time, invisible to the public: the technical decisions to be taken by the Bitcoin developers were not presented as political decisions, and were therefore never debated as such.""Additionally, Vitalik Buterin and Ethereum's core team were labeled with the same title of “dictator” as a consequence of the decision to alter the mainchain to refund the victims of the DAO hack on June 2016.The hack itself and the following debate between the supporters of Vitalik's choice and the defenders of the inviolability of the blockchain stressed, as an article on Wired noticed then, how much human weaknesses were still influencing processes that, theoretically, are managed only by the impersonal rules of mathematics.A similar dispute emerged once again in 2018 about the vote on the Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP-999), which aimed to unfreeze 587 multisig wallets attacked during the July 2017 Parity hack.It is worth noting that the internal debates inside both the Bitcoin and Ethereum communities brought the first relevant cases of a direct democracy instrument being applied, which is allowed by the blockchain architecture itself.Even if the process of development and amendment of the core software remains the privilege of a qualified technical elite, all the nodes taking part in the network can veto a piece of code, refusing to upgrade and forking the blockchain. Therefore, every miner has voting rights that are equal to the hashing power and, if a new alternative blockchain is born, the free and democratic rules of the market would determine which is the more successful coin.This happened, for instance, in July 2016, when the integrity supporters divorced from the amended Ethereum mainchain, giving birth to Ethereum Classic (as well as a new coin, ETC). Similarly, in August and October 2017, when people became unsatisfied with the introduction of SegWit on the Bitcoin network, they tried to find a solution to the block’s dimensions issue, creating, respectively, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Bitcoin Gold (BTG).This dream made of equal rights and free competition, however, is troubled by severe concerns over the actual distribution of mining power that sustains the different blockchains based on proof-of-work (PoW).When considering Bitcoin, for instance, it's easy to understand the distance from its pioneer days and the present: On May 22, 2010, on the legendary first Pizza Day, the hash rate required to feed the whole network was about 109 MegaHash/s (MH/s), while eleven years after, on BTC Pizza Day 2019, the required computing power reached almost 52 ExaHash/s (51,934,800,000,000 MH/s).While mining shifted from an amateurish activity to a capital-intensive business, the community has lost its role as a validator, which became much more of an exclusive prerogative of the giant mining pools that formed an oligopoly.The data published by one of them show that, since April 2013, the three largest mining companies produced more than 50% of the blocks of the system (BTC Guild with 37.83%, SlushPool 11.54% and BitMinter 7.09%). The situation changed very little during the following years, despite the swirling turnover among the companies leading the industry.The dynamic only seems to have scaled down in the very last few months; however, the dominance of the first three players (presently BTC.com, F2Pool and Poolin) is still above 40% of the blocks.Ethereum was born with specific features preventing ASIC-based mining. However, its algorithm could do nothing to limit a concentration of power, which is even more accentuated than in Bitcoin's blockchain: Since the summer of 2017, two pools alone — Ethermine and SparkPool — produced over 50% of the new blocks almost continuously every month.Even if vicious behavior that could undermine the whole crypto economy is rather unlikely in the two leading blockchains, recent events involving the smaller ETC demonstrated that the possibility of a 51% attack is far from theoretical. Last January, the exchange Coinbase revealed evidence of an ETC blockchain reorganization, which included double spending worth over $1.1 million.Proof-of-stake (PoS) could contribute to answering the concerns surrounding the rise in concentration of power within the mining industry and the risk that a malicious super-miner could hijack a whole blockchain.The critical feature of PoS is to bond the rights to validate the new blocks — to “vote” in cases of a fork — to facilitating a “lottery” influenced by the dimension of the stakes “frozen” in the nodes, instead of asking the validators to compete through computing power.This would bring some advantages — considering the fee levels, transaction speed and ecological footprint — as PoS forging is less demanding than PoW mining in terms of fixed capital and energy involved. Besides, the broader adoption of PoS would disrupt the mining business model, undermining the oligopolistic position of the pools that are dominating the market now.However, even if the shift toward PoS would theoretically bring immediate democratization in the way blockchain is being run, in a long-term perspective, it is somewhat unclear if and how forging business would avoid spiralling toward concentration and bringing it from individual geeks to giant multinational companies.Delegate proof-of-stake (DPoS), on the other hand, makes even more explicit the issue of the internal governance and the trade-off existing between scalability and decentralization. This consensus algorithm began to work for the first time in Bitshares, the first blockchain project designed between 2014 and 2015 by Daniel Larimer, also the creator of Steemit and EOS.Since then, the crypto community divided itself between those who equate Larimer to Satoshi Nakamoto and those who see DPoS as an unforgivable sin against the very nature of the blockchain.Cryptocurrencies must rely on blockchains that could guarantee that transactions will be unique and irreversible. However, to reach this advisable degree of security, it seems inevitable that a choice has to be made between either a time-consuming solution that implies a broad and distributed consensus or more effective architectures, which achieve efficiency while harming system decentralization.The so-called “scalability trilemma” was first coined by Buterin and Trent McConaghy to explain how difficult — if not impossible — it would be to attain scalability, decentralization and security, all at the same time.Since security is a sine qua non for every blockchain and scalability is a goal determining the success of a cryptocurrency, decentralization looks to be the odd one out.In DPoS, limiting the validation process to an elite group of nodes — empowered also by the stakes delegated by other members — would enhance the performance, guaranteeing both security (as malicious nodes would be sanctioned economically) and preventing unchallengeable power positions (as delegators could revoke their sustain if they disagree with the delegate's policy).The effectiveness and the actual match between this ideal model and its application could vary enormously from case to case, as everyone who lives in a country ruled by a representative parliamentary system would know.Like in politics, criticism and scandals are commonplace in DPoS. Since its launch in June 2018, the largest DPoS/PoS currency existing on the market, EOS, has been plagued by recurrent embarrassments revolving around its governance model.Decentralization doesn't seem to be a top priority for many DPoS supporters, indeed. For instance, last May, Neo founder Da Hongfei declared in an interview during Consensus 2019 that the high level of centralization of his blockchain is part of a strategy to compete against Bitcoin and Ethereum, in terms of superior performance. Despite some openings to decentralization during the summer of 2018, the Neo Foundation is still controlling half of the supply of NEO coins and the majority of the nodes running the network. ""That's intentional. We want to keep it more efficient,"" the Chinese entrepreneur said.It's then easy to understand why Buterin himself bluntly criticized EOS, Neo and other DPoS projects during his keynote at the last Blockchain Connect Conference in San Francisco on Jan. 11, 2019. In the same speech, Ethereum's co-founder stated his support for options he defined as ""good, legitimate ways to make a blockchain fast,"" without harming decentralization.  One possible solution to the problem of scalability would be the creation of a “second layer” network, that allows transactions to occur off-chain and then ultimately settle on-chain.Only, this secondary network would require some forms of centralization or trusted players to keep the mainnet both safe and decentralized, despite a significant growth in the number and speed of the performed transactions.This is the path by which the Lightning Network is experimenting on Bitcoin's blockchain and what projects such as Plasma, Raiden, Counterfactual and Truebits aim to introduce into the Ethereum ecosystem.Considering the “first layer,” Ethereum core developers have been working for a long time toward a more sophisticated solution. It encompasses both a new approach to PoS block validation, known as Casper, and the possibility for the network to operate through segmentation — called sharding — that allows every “island” of Ethereum to act as parallel blockchains, multiplying the performance of the system as a whole. The two development paths are presently joined under the label of Ethereum 2.0, the new spec of the cryptocurrency that is set to begin operating between 2020 and 2021.Proof-of-stake is indeed quite similar to the original form of democracy deployed in Athens during the fifth century B.C. This form of government was based, in fact, not on a free election but on a draw that could appoint randomly selected citizen as magistrate or as delegates of the “people.” Fate was therefore the guarantor of equality (however, the city denied civil rights to women, slaves and foreigners).Tezos' blockchain defines its distinctive feature as the ability to self-amend and self-govern its code evolution. However, is it unclear if the choice to label its first amendment as ""Athens"" was referring more to the random, PoS-ish nature of the historical Greek democracy or to the allure of participating in a free debate, which the ancient republic earned in collective consciousness.On Feb. 28, Paris-based developer team Nomadic Labs proposed the migration from the original protocol ""alpha"" to ""Athens,"" injecting the network with the hashes referring to two alternative code updates.The reform marked a milestone when considering the process rather than the content: Athens A aimed to reduce the number of Tezos’ native tokens (XTZ) accounted in one ""roll"" (the unit of account for Tezos’ proof-of-stake) and to increase the gas limit for each block, while the Athens B proposal contained only the gas limit increase amendment.As every new piece of code aiming to upgrade Tezos protocol, Athens charged a reward for the developers, if approved: The request was a symbolic amount, sufficient to pay for a round of beers for the team (100 XTZ, less than $150).The Tezos Foundation explicitly chose not to vote or to vote “Pass” during the different phases of the pool, to avoid influencing the results.During the first phase of the process, aiming to choose which proposal should undergo the voting, 170 bakers representing almost half of the XTZ on stake, decided to bring Athens A to the ""Exploration Period.""An even more significant number of participants (194 bakers, 87% of the stake) then expressed their opinion on the amendment, approving it and choosing to test Athens A in a sort of a “48-hours fork,” on a temporary parallel mainnet.  A final round of voting was required after the test (involving 216 bakers, representing 84.3% of the stake) to allow for an automatic update to the new code for all the nodes, which activated Athens A after 12:40 a.m. UTC on May 30.The high level of participation in the vote among the Tezos community is even more remarkable considering the recent failure of another experiment on direct involvement of token holders.Jacob Arluck from Tocqueville Group explained in a post on Medium the significance of Athens and stressed that the voting was indeed just a part of a more comprehensive process aiming to activate the Tezos community as a whole:“It's really exciting because it's the first step towards this idea of self-upgrading, decentralized, internet-native economic infrastructure.”Social networks, web-based platforms, on-chain signaling tools and baker-promoted pools are some of the instruments that guaranteed — in a somewhat unplanned and “decentralized” fashion — the debate among bakers and the delegator token holders.People opposed to the governance architecture seemed to have been the decisive factor and Tezos' co-founder, Arthur Breitman, confirmed to Cointelegraph that the success of Athens relied on a mix of direct participation and the delegation mechanism:""The fear of 'voter apathy' has permeated most discussions of on chain governance. Tezos guards against that issue by borrowing ideas from Gordon Tullock's concept of liquid democracy. The massive participation in the Athens vote and high degree of engagement from the community shows that this approach seems to be working.""The case of Tezos' amendment helps to focalize on the strong similarities between the debate about decentralization in blockchain and some well-established topics in sociology, economics and political science.The dilemma of performance vs. decentralization, for instance, has strong analogies with the debate regarding the relationship between political freedom and economic development. Considering the diverging paths of different developing countries (recently, India and China), argue that autocracy could achieve higher performance than democracy, because it is not impaired by the need to mediate with the public opinion and different groups of interests.Others, for instance, such as Nobel Prize winner Amartya Sen, believe that freedom is a part of the development process as its final aim, as an instrument to check its advancement and as a guiding light to define its direction. Professor Sen also recognizes, however, that real freedom means more than regular formal pools, and it is possible to transfer his concern for genuine political participation to the blockchain-related issues presented above.The effort that the Tezos community demonstrated in its first election is indeed quite similar to that of many opinion groups that try to resist “political laziness,” which affects many large democratic countries nowadays (Breitman reference to Tullock's article was not accidental).It is, however, unpredictable if it would be possible to reach such a high degree of involvement in a broader and more mature network. Bitcoin PoW mining too was somehow a democratic activity when nodes were in the hundreds; the real issue arises when the number of users surpasses the number of people directly involved in system development.Widespread adoption is likely to flood the system with users who are more concerned with issues like transaction cost and speed, user-friendly applications and global acceptance as a means of payment rather than obscure topics like 51% attacks or the scalability trilemma.It is even possible that the average user could freely choose to renounce a significant amount of the libertarian features that have defined cryptocurrencies since their origin, for the sake of more comfortable handling.In 1576, the French political philosopher Étienne de La Boétie clandestinely published his “Discourse on Voluntary Servitude.” The text explained that tyrants (La Boétie also put elected governors among them) could retain their overwhelming power over their subjects because the people themselves forfeit their original freedom.More than violence and intimidation, the French thinker argued that the real causes that brought the majority to accept servitude were the desire for profit and the custom of servitude itself.Even without calling it real “servitude,” nowadays, we are still undoubtedly living in a centralized world, among centralized institutions and using everyday centralized technologies we don't completely understand. It is therefore quite hard that a new frame of mind, more suited to handle the power and the responsibility coming with decentralization, could arise overnight.It is almost impossible to design a perfect voting system that, just using a set of rules, could force people to take responsibility for their freedom, limit media brainwash and prevent bribery. So, it seems quite unlikely that technology alone could assure the cryptocurrencies reach true decentralization under every possible scenario.It is impossible to know which answer to the issue of blockchain governance will become dominant in the future; however, it is plausible that the fundamentals of human behavior will be part of it, alongside mathematics."

Oversight Coming to Crypto?",https://cointelegraph.com/news/erisxs-spot-market-more-institutional-participation-and-regulatory-oversight-coming-to-crypto,"Per the information on its product page, ErisX will support dollar trading 
pair with bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ether and litecoin — in addition to 
bitcoin ...","May 12, 2019","United States-based cryptocurrency exchange ErisX recently announced the public launch of its spot market trading, a move that takes the company a step closer to its goal of being a one-stop shop for the trading of spot and futures contracts in a regulated environment.","Per the information on its product page, ErisX will support dollar trading pair with bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ether and litecoin — in addition to bitcoin trading pairs with the other three cryptocurrencies.Since 2017, ErisX has been building a trusted market infrastructure to support the institutional adoption of cryptocurrency.The Chicago-based company wants to make it possible for players in the capital market to have access to digital assets in the same way — and perhaps at the same venue — that they access traditional financial products like securities. Just before the end of April, there were reports that TD Ameritrade, which has some 11 million retail clients, has been testing ErisX’s crypto exchange and could soon offer crypto trading on its platform, where clients already trade traditional financial products.Beyond crypto spot market, which is what most existing crypto exchanges offer and is also what ErisX’s spot trading is about, ErisX plans to launch a derivatives exchange once the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) approves its application to operate both a derivatives exchange and a clearing house.As a quick refresher, a spot market is a trading venue — digital or otherwise — where financial instruments such as securities, commodities and currencies are traded for on-the-spot delivery. Delivery means the exchange of cash for the financial instrument in question. Therefore, a crypto spot market would be any venue, such as exchanges, where you can instantly trade cryptocurrencies.Trading on the ErisX spot market will work pretty much like existing exchanges like Coinbase. Users will need to go through Know Your Customer (KYC), Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Combating the Financing of Terrorism (CFT) compliance checks before they’re able to use ErisX’s platform. Traditional brokerage firms already do this when onboarding users that trade through brokerage platforms and may not have to repeat the process.Like other U.S.-based crypto exchanges, ErisX has licenses that make it possible for it to support the trading of a USD/crypto pair.Following the closing of the third round of Series B funding, which the company announced alongside the launch of its spot market exchange, ErisX has now raised a total of $47.5 million from 22 investors, according to business information platform Crunchbase.These investors — which include TD Ameritrade, DRW Holdings, CBOE, TradeStation and Nasdaq, just to name a few — are interested in ErisX for a few reasons, all of which sum up to the fact that they see promise in how the crypto exchange is building a robust, transparent, integrated and regulatory-compliant market infrastructure in the crypto space.TradeStation, an American online securities and futures brokerage company, invested in ErisX because it believes ErisX is bridging the gap between the traditional and crypto market. John Bartleman, president of TradeStation Group, in a press release, said:“TradeStation is actively working to help bridge the gap between traditional markets and crypto markets. Our investment in ErisX supports further advances in the crypto market structure and will help bring more established players into the space. Supporting firms like ErisX, that understand regulation and markets, benefits the crypto ecosystem.”TD Ameritrade, on the other hand, has seen increasing demand for the trading of crypto products from its retail customers. So, the American brokerage firm invested in ErisX because it sees the crypto exchange operator as a viable avenue to offer its customers access to the crypto market in a transparent way. Tim Hockey, CEO of TD Ameritrade said:“As investors in ErisX, as well as a strategic contributor in the initiative, we are looking forward to advancing our innovation goals by working with an established, CFTC-regulated exchange that will include digital asset futures and spot contracts on a single platform.”Steve Quirk, executive vice president of Trading & Education at TD Ameritrade, added that:“Our retail clients are seeking to access and trade digital currency products in the same way they do with traditional capital markets — through a legitimate, regulated and transparent exchange. That’s precisely why we chose to invest in ErisX — to make digital currency products more accessible to retail clients.”While U.S.-regulated exchanges including Coinbase and Gemini already offer institutional trading products in some ways, their services don’t cover the extensive needs of institutional investors. Institutional investors typically use leverage tactics to hedge or optimize their portfolio returns through derivatives. Some popular derivatives include futures, options, swaps, warrants, and contracts for difference.U.S.-based derivatives market operators CBOE Global Markets and CME Group were the first to offer cash-settled crypto futures. While CBOE discontinued its bitcoin futures offering in March, industry market intelligence provider Diar pointed at volume data to suggest that CBOE was struggling to compete adequately with CME. CME continues to offer bitcoin futures, with volumes reportedly growing on a monthly basis.However, investors and traders want a futures market for physical bitcoin settlement.In this context, physical bitcoin is the same thing as the bitcoin in your wallet. “Physical” is only a relative term to indicate that actual bitcoin is being traded for cash, as opposed to trades where only cash is changing hands based on the price of bitcoin.During a meeting with the CFTC on Feb. 14, 2018, Richard Gorelick, the head of market structure at the trading firm DRW, said:“We continue to have concerns that the way these futures contracts are pegged to these cash markets, which are less transparent, could result in dislocations in the future. We've expressed our view that we would like to see physically settled cryptoasset contracts to help deal with some of these concerns.”Cointelegraph had reported in June 2018 about possible manipulation of bitcoin prices for gains in the bitcoin futures market. In addition to the risk of manipulation, contracts are inefficient for professional traders who also actively trade cryptocurrency.Garrett See of crypto trading firm DV Chain told the Business Insider:""If they are physical delivery futures, then I know exactly what my P&L [profit and loss] will be if I hold it to expiration. If they're cash settled, I have to make another trade to unwind the spot position at expiration and I have to hope that I can unwind my position at the expiration price (including fees) even though I may not have the ability to trade on the exchanges that are being used to determine settlement price.""The futures products for physical settlement being developed by ErisX — as well as by its competitor, Bakkt — will meet the needs of institutional investors.Bakkt is a crypto exchange platform being developed by Intercontinental Exchange, the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange. Similar to ErisX, Bakkt is developing both crypto spot and futures market. Beyond creating a market infrastructure that attracts institutional players, Bakkt wants to build and develop crypto use cases, according to Bakkt’s chief operating officer Adam White.Following Bakkt’s announcement of a futures market for physical bitcoin settlement last year, See told Business Insider:“If bitcoin is trading at a discount in the spot market relative to the futures market, a trader can go long bitcoin and short the future for a profit. This is hard when a future settles in cash because it requires a trader to make another trade.”The CFTC last year reportedly requested trading data from top exchanges, following reports that the spot market might have been manipulated for gains in the futures market.The introduction of even more advanced futures products, like the ones ErisX and Bakkt are working on, could result in more regulatory oversight of the spot exchange operators. The increased attention could, in turn, drive the exchanges toward maintaining the best and most transparent exchange practices."

The development was announced by major Canadian electricity provider Hydro-Quebec on April 29.","Under the new regulations, the Régie de l’énergie has ordered power producer Hydro-Quebec to allocate 300 megawatts (MW) to the blockchain industry. “This 300 MW will be in addition to the 158 MW already granted to existing customers approved by Hydro-Quebec, and to the 210 MW granted to existing customers approved by municipal distributors,” the announcement further explains.In order to receive some of the specially allocated power, companies must pass a selection process where they are graded on four criteria including the number of jobs created in Quebec, total payroll of direct jobs, the value of investments and heat recovery. Hydro-Quebec says in the release that the new rules will enable the organization to protect the low rates it offers to customers.Canada has been recognized as a leading cryptocurrency nation based on its innovation, low energy costs, high internet speed and favorable regulatory regime. In late July of last year, Hydro-Quebec revealed that the province had an energy surplus equivalent to 100 terawatt hours over 10 years and offers some of the lowest electricity rates in North America.Last June, Hydro-Quebec proposed new rules, under which blockchain-related companies will be required to bid for electricity and quantify the jobs and investment they expect to generate per megawatt.Recently, the Ontario town of Innisfil, Canada, announced it is running a pilot program which will enable residents to pay property taxes with bitcoin (BTC), with possible extensions to other cryptocurrencies including ether (ETH), litecoin (LTC), bitcoin cash (BCH), and ripple (XRP) at a later date."

However, customers reportedly claim that some of them got only part of the money, while most of them did not receive their funds back at all.One of the exchange’s customers told money.pl that he had lost 2.005 bitcoins (BTC) (nearly $15,000 at press time). Another user stated that “on the second day after sending the e-mail I went to the Coinroom headquarters. The lady at the reception did not want to let me in, she claimed that nobody was in the office. Instead, she called someone from the company. I was asked to leave my details. Nobody contacted me.”Spokesman for the District Prosecutor's Office in Warsaw, Łukasz Łapczyński revealed that the office had initiated proceedings against Coinroom in connection with unauthorized activities providing payment services that intermediates in the exchange of cryptocurrencies. The office is also reportedly identifying other possible victims.CoinMarketCap’s cryptocurrency exchange index shows that Coinroom has terminated its activities. The firm’s Twitter page has also seemingly been deleted.As reported in mid-May, blockchain startups RepuX and JoyToken reportedly pulled a joint initial coin offering (ICO) exit scam. The companies reportedly ran their ICO promotions during March and April of 2018, and got away with $4.7 million and $3.3 million, respectively."

trades in only XRP, bitcoin (BTC) and bitcoin cash (BCH). Yet, as ...","May 27, 2019","Japan has been a land of firsts when it comes to crypto, even if ""Satoshi Nakamoto"" isn't really Japanese. It's the country where Mt. Gox — the first major crypto exchange — was based, as well as the first nation to accept bitcoin as legal tender. And last July, it became the first country to host a bank-owned cryptocurrency exchange, when financial services giant SBI Holdings launched the SBI Virtual Currencies (SBIVC) platform.","At the time of its launch, SBIVC — called VCTRADE at the time — enabled trades in only XRP, bitcoin (BTC) and bitcoin cash (BCH). Yet, as limited as it may have been, its attachment to the SBI stable meant that it benefited from access to resources and technology other exchanges in Japan could only envy. And as SBI's latest financials revealed in April, the exchange has grown rapidly, recording pretax earnings of almost 360 million Japanese yen (approximately $3.2 million) for the fiscal year up until March 31, 2019.But while it may still remain something of a minnow in a sea of BitFlyers and Coinchecks, it told Cointelegraph that it has plans to expand in the near and more distant future. Aside from widening its range of tradable cryptocurrencies, it also wants to branch out to institutional investors, as well as take advantages of potential ""synergies"" with its current businesses to provide one of the most secure and convenient exchanges in Japan.Given that SBI had previously partnered with Ripple in 2017 to launch the first commercially available remittance service using XRP, it was perhaps unsurprising that on July 11, 2018, it announced the opening of its VCTRADE cryptocurrency exchange, which first offered only XRP for trading, adding bitcoin and bitcoin cash soon after launch.However, beyond a crypto exchange arguably being a logical extension of a Ripple-based remittance service, SBI told Cointelegraph that it ultimately launched SBIVC because it believes in the innovative promise shown by cryptocurrencies.""The SBI Group believe that innovative technologies, including blockchain and crypto-assets have large potential for changing the financial industry.""On top of this, the SBI spokesperson added that SBI wants to create an ecosystem of interconnected services and platforms, which will create efficiencies for SBI and extra value for customers:""As the group’s basic strategy, we take an ecosystem approach, in which a business would make synergies with its other businesses. SBI Group fully started its digital asset ecosystem in early 2016, and as part of the strategy, launched SBI Virtual Currencies (SBIVC).""Indeed, going as far back as 2016, SBI Holdings was involving itself in the cryptocurrency industry. In February 2016, it invested an undisclosed amount in Kraken, while in October of that same year, it announced a partnership with IBM to test blockchain-based bond trading. And it was at the end of October that year that it first revealed its plans to launch its own cryptocurrency exchange.But once again, plans for an exchange weren't only part of an attempt to construct a joined-up ecosystem of financial services, since SBI is firmly convinced that cryptocurrencies offer practical advantages over legacy structures. ""The SBI Group see many possible advantages and benefits that digital assets would bring to the current system,"" SBI's spokesperson said. ""For one, lower commission fee and transaction period on international remittance.""As for how SBIVC functions right now, its website states that it lets customers trade four cryptocurrencies — XRP, bitcoin, bitcoin cash and ether (ETH) — for Japanese yen. It's currently not possible to trade cryptos against each other, and it's set to delist bitcoin cash in June.Its delisting of BCH raised some eyebrows, with many assuming that it had something to do with the delisting of bitcoin SV (BSV), a fork of BCH that itself had been removed from such exchanges as Binance and Kraken after BSV-affiliated Craig Wright threatened to sue certain individuals for claiming he wasn't ""Satoshi Nakamoto."" Given that SBI has a business partnership with Wright's nChain, it was suggested that the delisting may have been “retaliation” for bitcoin SV's delisting.However, according to SBI, the coincidence was just that, a coincidence, with its decision to remove bitcoin cash ""unrelated to the delisting of Bitcoin SV by several non-Japanese exchanges.” Indeed, its CEO, Yoshitaka Kitao, had previously criticized the bitcoin cash-bitcoin SV hard fork, largely for its being acrimonious.And with regard to its future plans for listing new cryptocurrencies, SBIVC's spokesperson confirmed to Cointelegraph that its choice of coins largely depends on the stability of its chain and community. ""SBIVC decides its listing currencies upon internal principle rules,"" she said. ""These include market capitalization of more than JPY 500 billion, does not have prospects of noxious hard-forks, and other factors including usage, liquidity, safety and profitability.""In other words, SBIVC isn't likely to list a cryptocurrency that has an imminent or near-term risk of forking, something that would presumably create complications for it and its customers. And in keeping with this ethos, its current setup is fairly stripped down and consumer-friendly, given that customers can only trade four cryptocurrencies (soon to be three) for yen, which is achieved simply by depositing yen in their accounts and then buying a corresponding amount of crypto.SBIVC also added the ability to deposit bitcoin, ether or XRP into customer accounts in December, while it plans to add crypto withdrawals soon. This once again underlines its simplicity and its focus on retail customers who might lack specialized knowledge of crypto. However, the exchange confirmed that it is planning, in the not-too-distant future, to cater to more than the average consumer.""SBIVC currently offer services only for retail customers,"" the SBIVC spokesperson said.""After AML/CFT method and custody solution that we are planning to implement are finalized, we would like to move forward and start providing services to institutional investors.""SBI is set up extremely well as a business to provide a variety of crypto exchange services to institutional investors. Not only does it have years of experience as a banking and financial services group, but it has recently been expanding the range of crypto-related products it offers, equipping itself in the process with the infrastructure and tools to offer a sophisticated and comprehensive exchange.In March, for example, SBI revealed that its MoneyTap payment app, which it had developed in partnership with Ripple, had received investments from 13 Japanese banks. That same month, it announced that it had established a spin-off company to manufacture mining chips, while it has invested in a number of cryptocurrency wallets and exchanges, giving it a wide grounding in almost all aspects of the burgeoning industry.Added to these developments, CEO Yoshitaka Kitao became an executive of Ripple Labs in April, indicating that SBI and Ripple will extend their collaboration well into the future — and that SBI isn't planning on walking away from crypto anytime soon.SBIVC's spokesperson told Cointelegraph that SBI doesn't simply want to assemble an ecosystem of interconnected crypto services. It also wants to bring its noncrypto services and infrastructure into play, doing so in a way that makes SBIVC one of the most efficient and secure exchanges in Japan.""Prioritizing customer asset protection, the SBI Group will make use of its synergies between current businesses, such as securities and FX, to acquire new customers.""When it launched back in July 2018, SBIVC had only around 2,000 customers, making it one of the smaller Japanese exchanges. However, aside from making a profit in its first year, there are plenty of other things that indicate it could grow substantially in size in the coming months.First of all, it belongs to an established banking group that reaped 67.3 billion yen (approximately $610 million) in profit in the fiscal year to March 31, giving it the resources to expand and grow. And related to this, it has already proven that it has the fundamentals of providing a secure and easy-to-use exchange, with a recent Nasdaq test finding that SBIVC's business model, Know Your Customer (KYC)/Anti-Money Laundering (AML) measures and exchange governance all met a high standard.It's for such reasons that it is highly probable to expect SBIVC becoming a bigger name on the Japanese crypto-exchange scene. And while this might seem like it's mainly good news for SBI, it's also good news for crypto in general, since the involvement of one banking giant will only encourage more adoption and investment in the future."

I just think it’s a little early on right now.”Rainey also revealed that PayPal made a $500 million worth investment in transportation network company Uber, because the two companies intend to jointly develop a payments platform.In mid-April, PayPal won a cybersecurity patent for a system entitled “Techniques for cryptocurrency ransomware detection and mitigation,” that intends to improve the detection of ransomware and prevent it from locking up users’ access to their files.Last year, PayPal filed another patent to increase the speed of cryptocurrency payments by using secondary private keys to reduce wait times for transactions between merchants and consumers. The patent details how the creation of secondary wallets with their own private keys will make transaction times much faster, “practically eliminat[ing] the amount of time the payee must wait to be sure they will receive a virtual currency payment in a virtual currency transaction.”"

The McAfee Freedom Coin appears to aim for total isolation and independence from traditional currencies, assets and exchanges in an effort to reach “the Holy Grail of cryptocurrency — economic freedom.”According to McAfee, these are the desired properties of the new cryptocurrency:“What is needed is a coin disconnected from fiat currencies and from other crypto currencies alike — a coin with zero cash-in value, yet accepted universally … It is not based on any commodity nor is it connected to the value or behavior of any external item or entity. The value of the coin will always be zero in relation to any other currency yet it's natural market value is free, completely, to grow.”As previously reported on Cointelegraph, McAfee has said he plans to run for President of the United States in 2020 on a boat in international waters, since he has purportedly been indicted by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS).McAfee has reportedly made no secret of his tax evasion, saying that he has not filed taxes for eight years. His presidential campaign is also not a serious bid for the office, but rather a stated attempt to promote cryptocurrencies as a means to securing personal freedom for citizens.In recent news, McAfee said that he has discovered the identity of the mysterious Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto, who is purportedly a man living in the U.S. McAfee apparently was planning to out Nakamoto’s identity, but has put his plan on pause per advice from his extradition lawyer:“The US extradition request to the Bahamas  is imminent. I met with Mario Gray, my extradition lawyer, and it is now clear ... that releasing the identity of Satoshi at this time could influence the trial and risk my extradition. I cannot risk that.

Lee delivered his comments during an interview with CNBC on April 28.,"In the interview, Lee forecasted that bitcoin (BTC) has not completed its upward movement and will likely reach new all-time highs around 2020 based on “11 signs that historically only take place in a bull market.” Lee thusly reiterated his previous prognosis made earlier this month, when he said that “a bull market is likely starting.”Lee explained that three out of those 11 signs — blockchain, technical indicators and trading volumes — indicate that the crypto winter has seen its end. In January, Lee’s team observed that trading volumes on the blockchain turned positive at an annual rate, while the second sign popped up in April, when BTC closed above its 200-day moving average.The third sign, trading volumes, is connected with over-the-counter brokers, who are “really important in terms of how institutional investors trade crypto.” According to Lee, activity levels based on the number of customers increased by 60% to 70%.“I think you’re seeing signs that fundamentals are improving, technicals are improving, and now there’s real activity by, essentially, crypto hodlers. [...] So I think […] a 2.5 standard deviation move for bitcoin would take it to $14,000. I’m not saying that’s where it’s going to go, but that’s the magnitude of move that would be a catch-up.”Earlier in April, Lee said that the “Bitcoin Misery Index” (BMI) — which Lee designed with the aim of informing investors of how “miserable” BTC holders are based on the coin’s price and volatility — recently hit its highest figure since June 2016. He suggested that this could be a mixed signal, also noting that “the main takeaway is that BMI reaching 67 is further evidence the bear market for Bitcoin likely ended at $3,000.”In February, Fundstrat released its 2019 crypto outlook, describing incremental improvements that will purportedly support higher prices for cryptocurrencies. Fundstrat mentioned that the overall interest in crypto might be stimulated by Binance’s recent decision to support credit card crypto purchases, along with the rumors that major companies like Bitfury and Bitmain might consider conducting initial public offerings."

This means that the “first U.S.-based publicly quoted security solely invested in and deriving value from the price of Ethereum is available.” Grayscale’s Director of Investments and Research Matt Beck commented on how investing in Ethereum can help investors build a profitable portfolio, saying:“Cryptocurrencies — such as Ethereum — offer exposure to a unique set of market opportunities and risks that are uncorrelated to traditional assets. As a result, they can further diversify modern portfolios, enhancing returns per unit of risk (when positions are sized appropriately and maintained over long investment horizons).”This closely mirrors CEO of Morgan Creek Capital Mark Yusko’s statement in May, in which he implored investors to hold bitcoin (BTC) due to its low correlation and high diversification.Grayscale Investments, the United States-based investment firm behind ETHE, also offers a trust for bitcoin — Grayscale Bitcoin Trust — as well as trusts for the cryptocurrencies Ripple (XRP), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Ethereum Classic (ETC), Litecoin (LTC), Stellar Lumens (XLM), Zcash (ZEC), and Horizen (ZEN).As previously reported by Cointelegraph, Grayscale got the green light to trade ETHE via OTC markets in May from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), a not-for-profit regulator authorized by Congress.However, Grayscale notes in its disclaimer that the trusts are not registered with the major American governmental watchdog, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC):“The Products are NOT registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) or any other regulatory agency in any jurisdiction, and are NOT subject to the same regulatory requirements as SEC-registered exchange traded funds or mutual funds [...] The Offered Products are being offered in private placements pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by Rule 506(c) under Regulation D of the Securities Act.

The organization’s latest guidance went into greater detail on this subject.Specifically, the organization wants cryptocurrency operators to establish the identity behind crypto funds senders and recipients, conduct proper due diligence to ensure they are not engaging in illicit activity, and develop risk-based programs, among others. Mnuchin said:“By adopting the standards and guidelines agreed to this week, the FATF will make sure that virtual asset service providers do not operate in the dark shadows. This will enable the emerging FinTech sector to stay one-step ahead of rogue regimes and sympathizers of illicit causes searching for avenues to raise and transfer funds without detection.”Simon Riondet, head of financial intelligence at Europol, a European Union law enforcement agency, said earlier in an interview with Reuters that money laundering with cryptocurrencies has been increasing.

slices — sets ...","May 20, 2019","Recently, blockchain-powered network Stellar stopped confirming transactions for more than one hour, effectively going offline.","Although no money was reportedly lost as a result, Stellar’s major issue has now been highlighted publicly: The project is not decentralized, at least not to the extent expected at this point. Notably, the offline scenario was predicted by researchers earlier last month.Stellar is a platform for money remittance. It was launched in 2014 by Jed McCaleb, founder of Mt. Gox and co-founder of Ripple, and former lawyer Joyce Kim. Stellar’s native asset is the lumen (XLM), currently the ninth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap.The Stellar network, in turn, is designed as a decentralized peer-to-peer network of validator nodes. Stellar Core software is used by the nodes to confirm transactions.To reach global consensus with other nodes, Stellar Core runs the Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP). As per the SCP’s white paper, it has “modest computing and financial requirements” compared to more popular decentralized schemes of proof-of-work (PoW) and proof-of-stake (PoS).In other words, instead of using an entire network to validate a transaction like bitcoin does, Stellar relies on the so-called quorum slices — sets of nodes that each validator node chooses to agree with. This system allegedly allows Stellar to unburden the network and host as many as 1,000 operations per second, compared to a much more modest rate showcased by bitcoin (up to seven transactions per second) and Ethereum (up to 15 transactions per second).Together, all quorum slices that make up the validator nodes form a global network, where voting is used to ensure consensus on which transactions are recorded to the ledger. According to Stellar, this process “occurs approximately every 2-5 seconds.”The Stellar Development Foundation (SDF) — a nonprofit organization committed to the development and adoption of Stellar — believes that the network collapsed because “new nodes took on too much consensus responsibility too soon.” Alternatively, as Nicolas Barry, chief technology officer of Stellar, put it, “it was caused by being too decentralized too fast.”More specifically, the outage seems to be directly related to earlier claims that Stellar’s network is too centralized. Last month, three researchers from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) published a paper titled “Is Stellar As Secure As You Think?” concluding that the analysis of the Stellar network proves that it “is significantly centralized.”Specifically, the researchers stressed that the entire Stellar network rested upon a limited amount of nodes, primarily the ones controlled by SDF itself:“We show that all of the nodes in Stellar cannot run Stellar consensus protocol if only two nodes fail,” the research claims. “To make matters worse, these two nodes are run and controlled by a single organization, the Stellar foundation.”Later that month, David Mazières, the chief scientist at SDF and a professor of computer science at Stanford University, penned a response. In it, he confirmed that the configuration of Stellar’s federated Byzantine agreement (FBA), which is a consensus model based on quorum slices, is highly centralized, and said that Stellar developers were “in the process of improving” it. Mazières continued:“We [...] are glad the authors drew attention to this fact. Things have already improved considerably from the configuration analyzed in the paper — for instance the Stellar Development Foundation (SDF) can no longer halt the network, and no two nodes can affect liveness.”Nevertheless, on May 15, at 1:14 p.m. PST, the Stellar network went offline for 67 minutes — according to SDF, while some other reports mentioned “approximately two hours” — after it failed to reach consensus. In a post-mortem analysis, SDF explained that the network froze because too many new nodes were being added in a bid to make it more decentralized:“We’ve seen claims that Stellar is ‘over-centralized’ and that somehow a failure with SDF’s nodes dragged down the whole network. Ironically, the opposite is true. Stellar has added many new nodes recently. In retrospect, some new nodes took on too much consensus responsibility too soon.”Specifically, a node of Keybase — a blockchain startup that SDF has invested in — was taken offline for maintenance. At that time, other nodes were reportedly “shaky or down,” which is allegedly why Stellar came to a halt.Furthermore, SDF claimed that stopping the network is in fact a preferable scenario for Stellar over operating in a faulty state, since the network accommodates financial institutions who supposedly chose it since they “prefer downtime over inconsistent data.” That is why the Stellar protocol didn’t fail, but actually worked as intended, the nonprofit organization argued.“As a fundamental design choice, Stellar prefers consistency and partition resilience over liveness,” the statement reads. “This is different from other blockchains, in which ‘the chain must go on’ even at the price of soft forks.”Additionally, SDF has highlighted that no funds were lost as a result of the incident, and the network is currently “healthy.”According to Yongdae Kim, one of the KAIST researchers who authored the April research on the Stellar network, the collapse happened after some changes were made to its structure.Specifically, Kim told Cointelegraph that, at the time the paper was submitted, if two out of three SDF validator nodes went offline, the Stellar network would collapse.After researchers reported on the vulnerability, SDF allegedly tried to decentralize the network by removing SDF validators from quorum sets. As a result, Stellar became robust against two node failure, but was still vulnerable to three node failure, according to Kim.However, right before the halt on May 15, the network has somehow become unstable in the face of a two node failure once more, Kim said, stressing that none of those node pairs belonged to SDF, given that they had been removed at the time. Eventually, a pair of those nodes went offline, which apparently brought the whole network down.To deal with the aftermath of network failure and bring it back online, SDF included all three of its validators into quorum sets, according to Kim, and hence have returned “back to step 1,” in which if two out of three SDF validator nodes go down, the Stellar network will collapse.“After we reported it [the cascade failure problem] to them, they manually adjusted validator setsfor a long time,” Kim explained to Cointelegraph. Nevertheless, he said the fact that network failure did occur at some point later on “shows that the design makes it difficult to maintain robust network structure against cascade failure.”Outlining the fundamental reasons for why the network is vulnerable to a cascade failure problem, Kim described how node hosts have to manually choose their quorum sets, which is difficult, given the complexity of the network’s design. Moreover, the KAIST researcher stressed that not all nodes are equally robust. “SDF are more robust, but they could be a good target,” he told Cointelegraph.The community’s general reaction was that Stellar is largely centralized, despite SDF actively pushing the opposite opinion. Emin Gün Sirer, co-director of IC3, tweeted:If your entire network is going down because a single entity had a problem, exactly how decentralized can your system be? That's right: not at all.https://t.co/6cEWPTPXYcIn response, Kyle McCollom, product manager at SDF, argued that several nodes were unavailable, while Keybase's node going down for maintenance pushed the network past the threshold:Several nodes were unavailable (""In the past few weeks we saw, repeatedly, misconfigured validators hampering consensus.""), and Keybase's node shutdown pushed the network past the threshold. This happened bc several nodes had a problem, not bc ""a single entity had a problem"".Similarly, a user post on Stellar’s subreddit originally implied that the network couldn’t reach consensus because SDF nodes went down, which was denied by McCalleb in the comment section: Stellar’s co-founder wrote that “the SDF nodes and in fact the majority of validators in the network were still up,” but “couldn't close ledgers safely because they weren't hearing from enough nodes in their quorums.”When asked whether the Stellar network could be called a decentralized one after the incident, Hartej Sawhney, a blockchain expert and co-founder of Hosho, replied negatively, but clarified that no project is decentralized today, as the concept has yet to be properly implemented. “Seems like the issue is less to do with centralization, but more to do with consensus responsibility of new nodes,” he told Cointelegraph.“At this point we of time, Stellar is definitely a centralized network, especially in terms of the liveness aspects, as it was demonstrated in a research done at KAIST,” Eyal Shani, a blockchain researcher at Aykesubir, agreed. “However, this should be no surprise since even the great Bitcoin network can be considered as centralized by many.”XLM’s price has been experiencing a flat base over the past few days, while the market continues to recover from a major correction that happened earlier this week.Moreover, on May 16, soon after the network failure was reported, XLM experienced a solid 15% growth, suggesting that the news didn’t affect the asset’s value.SDF has outlined a number of ways to make the network more decentralized and stable at the same time, as part of consequence management.First, the nonprofit aims to introduce better onboarding for new validators by providing users with published standards and explorers to help them create “good” quorum sets — presumably meaning that SDF will advise hosts on which nodes should be included in their quorum slices to avoid similar incidents.SDF also hopes to achieve better operational standards. “We will increase operator coordination so that maintenance schedules are publicly communicated,” the organization wrote in the blog post. “We will also help operators keep their nodes and their quorum choices up-to-date.”Moreover, SDF aims to improve better monitoring and alerting to warn node hosts about which crucial nodes are missing from the network, as well as to arrange bot-created announcements in the public validators channel anytime a node goes offline. Improved communication will also ensure that the network can be brought back online much quicker, the nonprofit suggests.Kim thinks that none of the SDF’s proposals tackle the cascade failure problem directly, which potentially could lead to further incidents. “Overall, these are good set of mitigations. However, it does not fundamentally solve the problem of Stellar,” he told Cointelegraph. “Without a design change, it would be difficult to improve liveness of Stellar.”Considering that SDF seems to prioritize consistency and partition resilience over network liveness, Stellar moving from the safety of trusted SDF nodes to a more decentralized scenarios could result in new system collapses, Shani of Aykesubir said. “Until they onboard enough serious validators who promise to behave (i.e be up and run the protocol) we could be seeing more halts in the near future,” he told Cointelegraph.Nevertheless, SDF remains optimistic, referring to the recent outage as a stress test, “one that Stellar passed in terms of user safety but failed in terms of uptime.”Time will tell if the nonprofit manages to reinforce its network to prevent further closedowns, but for now, Stellar could be joining the ranks of other major crypto projects that are criticized for a lack of decentralization.Cointelegraph has reached out to Stellar for further comment and will update this article once more information is obtained."
220,https://cointelegraph.com,"Apr 12, 2019",Will China Ban Crypto Mining?,https://cointelegraph.com/news/will-china-ban-crypto-mining,"For instance, when local regulators introduced yet another restraint on 
cryptocurrencies in January last year, Bitcoin swiftly dropped to its 
lowest ...","Apr 12, 2019","On April 9, Reuters reported that a Chinese government agency is considering the elimination of crypto mining in the country. Given that China has been hosting the majority of mining pools on its soil, the global crypto industry might be poised to take a massive hit. However, the plan is not written in stone at this point, and part of community has dismissed it as casual FUD.","Chinese authorities have been spearheading the “blockchain before Bitcoin” approach since September 2017, when the infamous crackdown on local initial coin offerings (ICOs) and crypto exchanges occurred. As of now, people in China can hold cryptocurrencies, but they are prohibited from trading them.The local mining industry specifically has also been subject to repressions. In February 2018, CNN Money reported that the Chinese government pushed crypto miners to make an ""orderly exit"" from the industry due to tax issues and mining being generally dangerous for the environment.Indeed, according to a separate article published by Quartz a month earlier, the country’s top internet-finance regulator, the Leading Group of Internet Financial Risks Remediation, ordered local authorities to use all available options — such as “measures linked to electricity prices, land use, tax, and environmental protection” — to force miners to shut down their business. In addition to that, the agency had allegedly obliged regional authorities to submit regular progress reports, detailing the existing mining facilities in their jurisdictions.In response to the intensifying crackdown, some of China's largest mining players chose to move shop or even change their main line of business. Thus, Chinese ASIC chip manufacturer and mining outfit Bitmain, once the industry’s most profitable company, which is now experiencing significant difficulties caused by the bear market, decided to turn to artificial intelligence (AI) as an alternate revenue source. “As a China company, we have to be prepared,'' Bitmain’s former co-chief executive, Jihan Wu, explained at the time. The company also planned to run a major mining operation in Rockdale, Texas, but had to suspend the plan due to the market collapse earlier this year.However, China remains a mining superpower. According to data from Blockchain.com, most of the largest Bitcoin mining pools are controlled by Chinese organizations. An earlier study conducted by the University of Cambridge argued that the Chinese dominance in the mining market was made possible by the cheap electricity and land available in provincial areas such as Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Yunnan and Sichuan. Reports issued around the same time indicated that over two-thirds of global mining pools were based in China.Now, China's central state planning agency, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), has revealed it might curb crypto mining in the country altogether. Notably, the news was first broken by state-owned newspaper the Securities Times, who reported that the NDRC’s draft list “distinctly reflects the attitude of the country’s industrial policy” toward the cryptocurrency industry, as per Reuters.Thus, the NDRC has reportedly included crypto mining as part of its draft for a revised list of industrial activities the agency intends to shut down because they “lacked safe production conditions, seriously wasted resources, polluted the environment,” among other issues.The move forms part of the NDRC’s wider Catalogue for Guiding Industry Restructuring, which has been issued since 2005 and determines which industries are to be encouraged, restricted or eliminated in the country.The agency has reportedly not set a proposed deadline for eliminating crypto mining industry, postulating instead that it should be dwindled with immediate effect. The public now has until May 7 to comment on the draft.As local newspaper South China Morning Post reported, the new plan brings uncertainty not only to local miners, but to the makers of cryptocurrency mining rigs as well. That would include the aforementioned Bitmain, which, in 2017, controlled an estimated three-quarters of the global market, as well as Canaan Creative, another large Chinese mining hardware manufacturer. Both companies had filed for initial public offerings (IPOs) in Hong Kong, but were met with skepticism by the local watchdog.Additionally, according to its IPO filing, by mid-2018, Bitmain operated as many as 11 mining farms in China, and hence would be largely affected by the NDRC’s reported plans. The company has declined to comment on the issue, as per various media reports.Historically, big news from China tends to affect the crypto market. For instance, when local regulators introduced yet another restraint on cryptocurrencies in January last year, Bitcoin swiftly dropped to its lowest level in more than a month, with Ethereum (ETH) declining 19% and Ripple (XRP) collapsing 29%.Similarly, the new ban, if implemented, is likely to have a strong impact on the global crypto industry, argue some crypto mining consultants, such as Mark D’Aria of Bitpro Consulting LLC. “Short term, it could be extremely disruptive,” he told Cointelegraph. He went on to say:“There will certainly be many winners and losers in the mining industry, as non-Chinese miners would benefit in the short term from significantly reduced difficulty, and from inexpensive surplus hardware as it filters out of China.”However, the ultimate effect largely depends on how, if and when the ban is implemented, D’Aria argues, which is unclear at this time:“If it was decreed that all miners were to shut down immediately, all of that hashrate lost in an instant could significantly disrupt the technical operation of the Bitcoin blockchain, slowing it down significantly until the next difficulty reduction. If this ban was implemented shortly after the last difficulty adjustment, this transitional period could last months.”In the worst-case scenario, D’Aria explains, it could take months for the network to bounce back — but either way, the Bitcoin blockchain should be safe in the long run.“It's yet another example of how resilient Bitcoin actually is — it can be disrupted in the short term, but long term it adjusts to compensate.”He elaborated:“Difficulty is adjusted every 2016 blocks. This takes approximately every two weeks at a stable hashrate. If 80% of the hashrate were to go offline 16 blocks after the adjustment, the next 2000 blocks would take 5x as long to mine (assuming the hardware wasn't rapidly redeployed outside of China.) This two week period would stretch out to over two months. During these two months transaction rate would also be slowed down by 80%, confirmations that used to take minutes will take hours and fees will likely rise dramatically due to competition for block space. At a time when Bitcoin is still widely criticized for being slow and expensive to use, it's hardly going to do Bitcoin any favors. [...] But if China allows miners to wind down over a few weeks, difficulty adjustment will gracefully handle the loss in hash rate, and there would be little noticeable change to the functioning of the Bitcoin blockchain.”If the ban does come through, however, part of the mining economy could move underground, but the overall scope of mining operations won’t be the same for China, which might be dethroned by other countries in that case, D’Aria said:“It [cryptocurrency mining in China] can continue at a very small scale — a basement here, a shed there, etc. However, it is not plausible that large mining farms would be using megawatts of electricity without the authorities noticing. Even if a few chinese miners try to carry on at a small scale, on a global level it would be insignificant. The US, Canada, Scandinavia and a few Eastern European nations would then comprise the lion's share of mining power — and in all likelihood the mining hardware would eventually filter outside of China to those who can still use it.”Other parts of the crypto community don’t see any reason to panic whatsoever. For instance, Dovey Wan, founding partner at blockchain-focused Primitive Ventures, pointed out that the NDRC’s purview in regard to the industries it wants to eliminate seems limited:there is another version of such proposal published in 2011 https://t.co/BY2unufFbdObviously many stuff should be “eliminated” in the 2011 version reappear in the 2019 version 🙃🙃🙃 such proposal in China usually is just “proposal”A similar viewpoint was expressed by an independent crypto industry analyst Katherine Wu, who told Wired that this clampdown seems to be more indirect compared to previous crypto regulations in the country, and many industries on the commission’s list of wasteful activities are still far from what’s described under “immediate elimination.”“It is categorized as an industry that is not encouraged or allowed to expand, but it is not a ban,” Zhao Qianjie, a former employee at BTCChina exchange, told The New York Times, arguing that the government might not impose strict sanctions for local miners.Emin Gün Sirer, creator of the world’s first cryptocurrency to deploy a proof-of-work (PoW) concept and professor at Cornell University, argued that the news “doesn't mean the end of Bitcoin” in a series of tweets.“It just means that most of the hashpower will move across a border, some will go ‘underground’ in China, tucked into backrooms of old factories. Cost of coin production might go up, but that doesn't affect coin price at all.”Sirer then categorized the media reports as “China FUD.” “Though as far as consumer-affecting FUD goes, this is pretty weak,” he tweeted. “The impact is on miners, not regular users.”Instead, Sirer referenced the reports to talk about the status of proof-of-stake (PoS) in the global crypto market, which, in his opinion, has far more advantages compared to PoW.“It's high time some adult looked at what was happening with PoW mining, namely, racks of machines performing useless calculations whose sole purpose is to hold back other racks of machines, and said ‘this is a waste of electricity.’ [...] The coming year will be the year of Proof of Stake systems. They are green, sustainable and quiescent. They do not leak any value from the store of value to the power company. There's no dependency on a state energy commission for their security.”Notably, last week, in the United States, Montana’s county of Missoula adopted new regulations for cryptocurrency mining, requiring miners to use only renewable energy.Nevertheless, while PoS is indeed generally considered to be much more power-efficient than PoW, it might have its own shortcomings as well, warns D’Aria:“Arguably the core difference between PoW and PoS is that PoW is an inextricable link between the blockchain and the ‘real world’, for better or worse. Whereas PoS exists purely as a computational and societal construct, no one has to give up anything extrinsic to the system in order to keep it running, and with nothing to physically anchor it's value to the real world a crisis of confidence in the value of the currency could potentially lead to a death spiral where security becomes so compromised by loss of coin value that it is effectively destroyed. Just because we haven't seen something like that happen to a PoS blockchain yet doesn't mean it can't — there's a first time for everything.”"

Poloniex also claims that it will return the funds to affected lenders as soon as it recovers the lost money. Poloniex suggested that the crash occurred due to a number of reasons, and further explained:“The velocity of the crash and the lack of liquidity in the CLAM market made it impossible for all of the automatic liquidations of CLAM margin positions to process as they normally would in a liquid market. In addition, a significant amount of the total loan value was collateralized in CLAM, so both the borrowers’ positions and their collateral lost most of their value simultaneously.”Last month, Poloniex stopped offering trading in nine coins to customers in the United States.

layer RIF OS — has launched a third-layer scalability solution.","May 15, 2019","RIF Labs — owner of bitcoin-based smart contract sidechain Rootstock (RSK) developer RSK Labs — has launched a third-layer scalability solution capable of processing up to 5,000 transactions per second. The news was revealed in a press release from RIF News on May 14.","As reported, RSK Labs and its decentralized app (DApp) infrastructure protocols RIF OS began as a spin-off from Rootstock, having been initially launched by several senior executives from the latter’s creator — the startup RSK Labs. The two structures became fully integrated when RIF Labs acquired RSK Labs in November 2018.Originally conceived by Bitcoin Core developer Sergio Lerner, the Rootstock sidechain saw several years’ development before its initial mainnet release in January 2018. As blockchain engineer Albert Szmigielski outlined during the project’s early days:“Essentially Rootstock aims to be what Ethereum is, a decentralized, Turing-complete smart contract platform. However, Rootstock aims to utilize the Bitcoin ecosystem rather than creating a new one from scratch.”RIF Labs’ new offering is a third-layer scalability solution dubbed Lumino, now officially live, which supports processing 5,000 TPS on the RSK sidechain.In its ambitions, the solution is close to the Lightning Network, which works to mitigate scalability limitations by opening state channels between users that keep the majority of transactions off-chain, turning to the underlying blockchain only to record the net results.With Rootstock reportedly capable of processing up to 100 transactions per second, Lumino aims to provide an off-chain solution that will facilitate near-instant transaction processing levels regardless of the increasing weight of the bitcoin blockchain.As revealed earlier this week, RIF Labs will now soon be rebranding as IOV Labs, in a bid to differentiate the organization from both the open-source RSK and RIF OS protocols.Lumino is also further reportedly compatible with the Name Services component of RIF OS, which enables users of state and payment channels to use aliases rather than complex hexadecimal addresses.In recent remarks to Cointelegraph, Ethereum (ETH) co-founder Joseph Lubin claimed that the Ethereum blockchain will become about 1,000 times more scalable within 18 to 24 months, once it completes its transition to Ethereum 2.0 (also known as Serenity)."

Kabambe stressed that there is no institution in the government that oversees crypto trading and regulates the parties involved in the industry.In this regard, the governor named major risks associated with crypto investments, including money laundering and security breaches, as well as vulnerabilities to hacks and fraudulent activities.Kabambe also noted that there is no crypto exchange that has been registered in the country, a fact that represents another risk factor for local people wishing to invest in crypto.According to the report, the RBM’s official statement has followed a growing interest from the country’s residents on the matter, including the increased number of crypto-related enquiries to the bank.On the other hand, Kabambe said that the RBM is aware of the potential of blockchain, the underlying technology of most cryptocurrencies that has particular use cases in a number of industries. He added that the bank will continue to track global developments regarding the technology, and reserves the right to review its stance and regulatory position if considers it to be necessary.Earlier this year, the South African Reserve Bank released a consultation paper revealing that the local government did not plan to ban either cryptocurrency trading or crypto payments at the time."

Baron noted, however, that the decision to issue the court order did not prevent the bank from scrutinizing the exchange’s behavior or complying with their risk management policy.In March 2019, the Israeli Securities Authority issued its final recommendations for cryptocurrency regulations.

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.","The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.Instant messaging service Telegram reportedly plans to launch its Telegram Open Network (TON) in the third quarter of this year. It has created a new programming language called Fift, which will help develop and manage TON blockchain smart contracts and interact with the TON Virtual Machine.On the other hand, Facebook is allegedly planning to launch its own cryptocurrency in early 2020. The company expects its large user base to start using its cryptocurrency in a dozen countries for making purchases, transferring money and more. Mark Zuckerberg, the founder and chief executive of Facebook, has reportedly discussed the project with U.S. Treasury officials along with Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England.  Bitcoin bull Michael Novogratz believes that one of the crypto assets created by the above-mentioned companies is likely to be successful and can even have a “chance to be a real currency.” He also reiterated that the “crypto winter is over” in comments this week. And, according to token rating platform ICObench, the ICO sector is showing a higher success rate as the sentiment improves.Bitcoin sv (BSV) was the best performer among the major cryptocurrencies with a rally of above 60% in the past seven days. The boost came amid the news that nChain founder Craig Wright had filed United States copyright registrations for the Bitcoin white paper and the original code used to build Bitcoin. However, the bitcoin community and a few experts do not consider this to be an important event that can alter the fortunes of bitcoin sv. But what do the charts project? Let us find out.The BSV/USD pair skyrocketed this week and reached the overhead resistance of $134.360. However, profit booking and selling just above this resistance resulted in the pair giving up a large part of its gains. The cryptocurrency should find some support at the current levels, failing which, the drop can extend to $82.489 and lower.While the sharp up move from the lows shows buying at lower levels, the failure to hold onto the gains shows a lack of demand at higher levels. The pair will pick up momentum on a close (UTC time frame) above $134.360 and will weaken below $38.528. Until then, it is likely to remain range bound between these two levels.Binance coin (BNB) has been one of the strongest performers among the major coins: it has consistently made new highs and is in a strong uptrend. Riding high on its success, cryptocurrency exchange Binance is reportedly planning to offer margin trading to its clients. The exchange is also giving away $1,000 of $ONE tokens to celebrate the launch of the forthcoming token sale. How far can the rally continue? Let us find out.The BNB/USD pair is in a strong uptrend and has picked up momentum after breaking out of previous lifetime highs. Earlier, the resistance line had acted as a major roadblock, but the bulls are currently attempting to breakout of it. If successful, the rally can extend to $40 and above it to $46.1645899, which is a 1.618 Fibonacci extension level.But the rally is getting vertical and the RSI on the weekly charts is threatening to enter deeply overbought territory. This shows that the up move has been overdone in the short-term, and that a minor correction or consolidation can start between $40 and $46.1645899.Litecoin (LTC) is benefitting from the positive sentiment in the crypto space, and the forthcoming halving has added to the bullishness. A series of tweets by OKEx pointing to some kind of an announcement regarding Litecoin has also heightened interests. Can the upward move continue?  The LTC/USD pair has completed a cup and handle reversal pattern that has a minimum target objective of $158.81. If the momentum continues, the upward move can extend to $172.647. The moving averages completed a bullish crossover a couple of weeks back and the 20-week EMA is sloping up: this shows that the bulls have the upper hand.Our bullish view will be invalidated if the cryptocurrency fails to sustain the breakout and dips below the support of $91 once again. The support levels to watch on the downside are $84.3439, $74.6054 and below it to $60.1980.Two miners who control about 43% of the bitcoin cash (BCH) mining pool, BTC.top and BTC.com, joined hands this week and executed a 51% attack to stop an unknown miner from taking coins that were accidentally sent to “anyone can spend” addresses. In this case, the attackers did not carry out the 51% attack for their own benefit, but still some believe that it shows that the cryptocurrency is too centralized. How does its chart look?The BCH/USD pair is currently rising inside an ascending channel. It has crossed above both the moving averages, which is a positive sign. The bulls are facing selling at the resistance line of the channel, but the positive thing is that the pair has not given up ground. If the price holds above the 50-week SMA, we should see another attempt to breakout of the channel. If successful, a rally to $620 is probable.On the contrary, if the bulls fail to scale the resistance line of the channel, the digital currency can dip to the support line of the channel, closer to $300. A breakdown of this support will break the trend.Dash (DASH) released its latest version 0.14 on the mainnet, which is another step leading to version 1.0, dubbed evolution. The upgrade improves the security of the network against 51% mining attacks, the first for proof-of-work networks, according to Dash Core CEO Ryan Taylor. An analysis by Cryptoslate shows that DASH has seen a growth of 58% in the active address count from 2018 to 2019, the largest growth among the major coins. This was reportedly mainly due to the surge in usage in crisis-hit Venezuela.The DASH/USD pair has been facing resistance at $176.81 since the past week, and a breakout of this barrier will propel the pair to the next level of $229.24. We expect the bulls to again face selling at these levels. Currently, both the moving averages are on the verge of a bullish crossover and the RSI is in the positive territory. This shows that the bulls are at an advantage.  However, if the digital currency turns down from $176.81, it might enter into a consolidation. The support of the range will be at $107.36, and a break of this support will be a bearish sign.The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange."

investment — plans to stick with blockchain instead. Herman Gref, CEO of ...","Jun 16, 2019","Last week, an annual forum featuring Russia’s top people from the economic sector was held in St. Petersburg, and cryptocurrencies were a hot topic there. Notably, government agents and state-controlled businesses were vocal about their interest in blockchain, but seemed to distance themselves from digital tokens.","Meanwhile, the regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies is still missing in the country, despite the fact that local authorities have been tasked to prepare the needed amendment a while ago. So, where is Russia heading in terms of crypto and blockchain?Russia’s stance on cryptocurrencies has been mixed and fluid, as demonstrated by how the “CryptoRuble” — the national stablecoin project — has been unfolding. First, the prospect of  using a substitute for conventional money was deemed “illegal” by financial ombudsman Pavel Medvedev. Then, the Kremlin supposedly decided that a pet stablecoin could “minimize the amount of anonymous transactions,” or even help evade Western sanctions, thereby greenlighting the project. However, the CryptoRuble ended up on the back burner in the end, as the current status of the project is unclear. It was last mentioned in the news in January 2019, when a government official declared that it could go live “in a 2-3 years,” although the Central Bank of Russia (CBR) was acting “very conservatively” about the idea.Cryptocurrencies at large are in a similar situation. In October 2017, President Vladimir Putin claimed that cryptocurrencies “cause serious risk” and are used for crime, citing the CBR’s decision to block websites selling digital assets. Just a month prior to that, Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov argued that the authorities had to accept the idea of the digital currencies market:“There is no sense in banning them, there is a need to regulate them.”There have been numerous attempts to define cryptocurrencies legally since then. At different times, Russian lawmakers have been urged to introduce a regulatory framework by President Putin (twice), the local Supreme Arbitration Court and the Financial Action Task Force.In May 2018, the crypto bill — titled “On Digital Financial Assets” (DFA) — was passed by the Russian parliament but was soon sent back to the first reading stage due to the lack of definitions for key concepts, such as crypto mining, cryptocurrencies and tokens.Last month, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev reportedly said that the popularity of cryptocurrencies “has decreased,” which is why the regulation issue “not that relevant” anymore. Notably, a year ago, he urged the government to legislate at least some basic crypto terms.The current deadline for the regulatory framework set by Putin expires in July.Despite the prime minister’s suggestion that cryptocurrencies have decreased in popularity, they were widely discussed at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum (SPIEF), an annual Russian business event for the economic sector, which took place from 6 to 8 June.The panel dubbed “Blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies: Past, Present, Future” saw Vitalik Buterin, a co-founder of Ethereum; Chris Lee, a financial director at Huobi; Ted Lin, chief growth officer at Binance; and Kevin Shao, among others, featured in the expert pool.Lin and Lee reported an influx of traders of a “new generation” on their platforms due to the recent market growth. According to them, the trend will persist for the near future.Buterin, in turn, talked about Ethereum 2.0, also called Serenity — a major upgrade that is supposed to make Ethereum 1,000 times more scalable in 18 to 24 months.Sergey Shvetsov, first deputy governor of the CBR, reportedly compared cryptocurrencies to a “game” while peaking at the SPIEF. He is quoted as saying:“If we’re talking about cryptocurrencies and forex-clubs, it’s not a financial market, it’s just a game. There are people who like to play, they invest in it [cryptocurrency], but the ripples will affect others. Which is why we have quite a strict policy here.”Hence, the CBR once again stressed its skeptical position toward cryptocurrencies. Last month, Elvira Nabiullina, the head of the Bank of Russia, said her agency was against the idea of crypto becoming a substitute for fiat money.Leonid Petukhov, the head of the Far East Investment and Export Agency, suggested creating an offshore destination for cryptocurrencies on the Bolshoi Ussuriysky island, which lies on the border with China. He told TASS, a Russian news media:“We want to make a large financial center there. Metaphorically speaking, that would involve cryptocurrencies, cryptocurrency exchanges, timber trading platforms — so like domestic offshore, in a good sense. What we did in Kaliningrad.”Petukhov was likely referring to Oktyabrsky Island in the Kaliningrad region, which, along with Russky Island in Vladivostok, became offshore economic zones in 2018. Foreign companies registering in those clusters are exempt from certain levies — for instance, they are free from paying taxes on profits received by way of dividends. However, neither of those zones currently involve any cryptocurrency-related benefits.Herman Gref, CEO of state-owned bank Sberbank, declared that he considers bitcoin a “technical instrument for transactions,” rather than a type of investment. He also referred to his own experience of investments in crypto, revealing that he had bought bitcoin when it was worth about $5 and used it for payment purposes instead of holding the coins.Further, Gref clarified that his bank will not develop any crypto-related services but will focus on blockchain-enabled tools instead. As the CEO put it, the crypto market’s hype has gone, but “regular work with blockchain tech has remained,” which makes him “happy.”Nornickel, the world's leading producer of nickel and palladium, signed a partnership agreement with IBM and the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (MIPT) during the forum. The alliance will establish an education center that will offer blockchain-related programs, both for postgraduate and Ph.D. students.“Students and postgraduates will learn how to apply blockchain technologies, and will gain knowledge about cryptocurrency exchanges, stablecoins, tokenization platforms and similar services,” the parties reportedly declared in a mutual statement.Moreover, Nornickel’s president, Vladimir Potanin, argued that tokenization has the potential to make trading easier, cheaper and more transparent. Earlier in March, he unveiled his company’s plans to create cryptocurrency tokens backed by palladium. Those tokens will purportedly be used for trading palladium through a Switzerland-based palladium fund, as well as on several other digital platforms.Blockchain-based Vostok platform’s main network was launched at SPIEF. The mainnet will reportedly be used to validate transactions, while Vostok’s clients — represented by large Russian corporations and state agencies — will also have the ability to create their own nodes and use private subnets.As Cointelegraph reported last month, the Russian city of Nizhny Novgorod had begun testing the use of the Vostok-powered application “City N,” which allegedly allows residents to file their taxes and verify their identity, among other things.Igor Sechin, head of major Russian oil company Rosneft, reflected on a potential relationship between oil and cryptocurrencies. Specifically, he said that the possibility of paying for oil using digital assets in the future “should not be ruled out.”According to Sechin, Silicon Valley tech giants like Google, Amazon and Apple are beginning to explore the oil and gas sector, which is why a Facebook stablecoin could one day be used to purchase oil by the barrel.Further, Sechin warned there are some obstacles that cryptocurrencies need to overcome in order to draw the attention of energy giants. He was quoted as saying:“Greater flexibility often means greater volatility, and digitalization creates risks for maintaining commercial secrets and leads to the need to create new regulatory mechanisms, additional reservations. Today, technology companies do not have quality answers to these fundamental questions.”Meanwhile, the Russian government continues to consider strict regulations for the cryptocurrency industry. Most recently, a representative of Russia’s parliament mentioned that the officials are considering imposing administrative responsibility for the mining of cryptocurrencies.“We believe that cryptocurrencies created on open blockchains such as bitcoins, ethers, and others are illegitimate tools,” Anatoly Aksakov, the chairman of the State Duma Committee on the Financial Market, told TASS.Things are much more bullish on the blockchain front, however. This week, Russian authorities signed an agreement with Danish logistics titan Maersk to launch TradeLens — a blockchain shipping platform — across all of Russia to digitize paper-based transportation operations. Earlier last month, Russian state-owned holding conglomerate Rostec proposed an ambitious roadmap on applying blockchain in all the governmental data systems — all of which seems to suggest that Russia’s intentions toward the technology are getting increasingly serious."

Furthermore, Zhao also defined the developments “a classic example of short term pain, long term gain.” He explained:“It is inconvenient for people short term, and they take a hit. But long term, it is precisely this type of restriction of freedom that will push people to use crypto. Not a bad thing.”Lastly, he noted that it would be hard to beat the user experience offered by the WeChat payment services if it wasn’t for such restrictions.WeChat Pay reportedly registered a total daily transaction volume of over 1 billion (currency unspecified), while the overall number of users allegedly reached 1.098 billion by the end of last year. According to technology news outlet TechNode, the app is also popular among older people, with 98.5% of Chinese people aged between 50 and 80 WeChat users.As Cointelegraph reported last month, major Chinese city Guangzhou has issued a business license using blockchain and artificial intelligence technology also featuring a WeChat integration.At the end of January, news broke that major WeChat Pay competitor Alipay and WeChat Pay reportedly requested that crypto exchange Huobi remove their payment services from its over-the-counter trading desk."

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.","The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.For the past few days, cryptocurrencies have managed to hold onto a large part of their gains. This is a positive sign, as it shows that the bulls are not in a hurry to book profits. It is also comforting to see that the gains have come on the back of increasing volumes. Bitcoin’s (BTC) trading volume on Coinbase recently hit its highest level since Feb. 4 of last year, which shows that the price is rising higher backed by strong demand.However, the positive sentiment supported by improving fundamentals has led to a number of analysts projecting a vertical rally in bitcoin, similar to the one seen in 2017. Some of the targets currently talked about are $25,000 and $40,000, both within a short span of time. While anything is possible in the crypto markets, we believe that these calls are a little more aggressive. The current rally is likely to face a number of bumps en route to new highs and will test the patience of the bulls. Therefore, we suggest traders wait for dips to buy instead of chasing the price higher.Cosmos (ATOM) was the best performer among the top 20 major cryptocurrencies in the past seven days. The platform surged to second position on Github with 4,245 events in the past 30 days, ending June 4, which is a positive sign. What does the chart project?Due to a short trading history, we shall use the daily chart for analysis. The ATOM/USD pair has been consolidating roughly between $5.660 and $6.603. Attempts to breakout of this range failed on June 3 and 4, which shows a lack of demand at higher levels. However, the dips to $5.660 were purchased on June 5 and 6, which shows buyers willing to get in at support.Consolidation near the highs is a positive sign: it is usually followed by a breakout and continuation of the upward move.A breakout and close (UTC time frame) above $6.603 will resume the uptrend that can carry the price to $7.905. If this level is crossed, the upwards move can extend to $8.794. Our bullish view will be invalidated if the pair plummets below the 20-week EMA, and the next lower support is at $4.8.Litecoin (LTC) is the second-best performer of the past seven days. The upcoming halvening is acting as a bullish factor that has kept the price close to its recent highs. Traders anticipate that reduced supply will result in higher prices. The litecoin hashrate has also been making new highs consistently, which is a positive sign. Can the price continue higher or has it hit a hurdle?The LTC/USD pair is facing selling at the resistance line of the ascending channel. However, the attempts by the bears to sink it have been unsuccessful. Buyers have been stepping in close to $100 and pushing the price right back up, which is a positive sign.If the bulls push the price above the resistance line of the ascending channel, the pair will rally to $158.91. This is the target objective following the breakout from the cup and handle pattern. Above this, we anticipate a move to $184.7940, which is likely to act as a stiff resistance.If, however, the cryptocurrency fails to break out of the channel, the bears will again try to sink it below the breakout level of $91. A breakdown of this and the support line of the channel will indicate a change in trend.This is the third successive week that bitcoin sv (BSV) has been among the top five performers. The surge in price following the news about Craig Wright’s filing for copyright claims on the bitcoin white paper has held up quite well. What is in store in the next few weeks? Can the uptrend resume or will it dump? Let us analyze the chart.The BSV/USD pair has formed an inside week candlestick pattern and is finding support close to a 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of the recent rally, while it is facing resistance near the high of $254. This points to a consolidation in the next few weeks, and a range formation after such a sharp move is a positive sign. After the boundaries of the range are defined, traders can buy closer to the support and sell near the resistance. Currently, we do not find any reliable pattern that offers a good risk to reward ratio.The uptrend will weaken if the pair breaks down of $176.083 and drops to $152.015, which is a 50% retracement level of the recent upwards move. If this level also breaks, the trend will turn down. Conversely, a breakout and close (UTC time frame) above $254 will resume the uptrend and launch the cryptocurrency to $307.789 and above it to $340.248.The website for the Binance decentralized exchange (DEX) plans to block users in 29 countries from accessing the DEX. The exchange has also released its official Trust Wallet for the Binance DEX users, and also plans to issue its own stablecoin within the next two months, which will be 100% pegged to the British pound and will be called “Binance GBP.” Subsequently, the exchange plans to release stablecoins backed by other currencies, barring the U.S. dollar. In other Binance news, a former executive at Dell and the NBA will join Binance as theIR new official strategy officer. Backed by fundamental news, can binance coin (BNB) extend its upwards move or is the rally tiring out? Let’s analyze.In a strong uptrend, the pullbacks are shallow and the price quickly bounces off strong supports because traders jump in to buy on any dip. Backed by momentum, the price quickly rallies to make a new high. The BNB/USD pair has been making a series of new highs after breaking out of the previous high of $26.4732350 in mid-May, which confirms that the pair is in a new uptrend. The first target to watch is $40, followed by a rally to $46.1645899. If the momentum picks up, the upwards move can even extend to $56.0786952.On the contrary, if the bulls struggle to propel the price above the resistance line, a few weeks of consolidation is possible. The trend will turn negative only after the higher highs and higher lows sequence is violated. Until then, the uptrend remains in force.Ripple, the company behind crypto asset XRP, has said that it will take a more conservative approach in reporting XRP sales this quarter. This is being done to allay the fears among institutions and consumers on fake reporting of trading volume in the crypto markets. Thailand’s largest commercial bank, Siam Commercial Bank, has denied that it plans to use Ripple’s XRP token, just days after a tweet that hinted the bank’s plans to do so. Also this week, hackers stole about $10 million worth of XRP from nearly 100 XRP ledger wallets on wallet service GateHub.  The XRP/USD pair has formed a flag following the rise from the lows. A breakout of the flag will point to a resumption of the up move that can carry the price to $0.66413 and above it to $0.76440.Conversely, a breakdown of the flag will be a negative sign, as it shows a lack of demand at higher levels. The pair has support at $0.37835 and below it at $0.355660. The 50-week SMA and 20-week EMA are also close to these horizontal supports. Therefore, we expect buyers to defend this zone, failing which, the trend will turn negative. The next couple of weeks are critical as it will set the direction for the next leg of the move.The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange."

The claim was made in a report released by the research arm of cryptocurrency derivatives exchange BitMex on May 24.","Per the report, the recent BCH hard fork experienced three interrelated issues. Firstly, an apparent bug evidently exploited by an attacker right after the hard fork. The attacker was able to “broadcast transactions which met the mempool validity conditions but failed the consensus checks.” Miners attempting to produce blocks with said transactions were not able to, instead producing empty blocks.The empty blocks reportedly resulted in concern among miners who “may have tried to mine on the original non-hardfork chain, causing a consensus chainsplit.”The third interrelated problem was that the consensus chainsplit reportedly prevented a system meant to recover funds accidentally sent to SegWit addresses from functioning. According to BitMex Research, “[t]his failure may have resulted in a deliberate and coordinated 2 block chain re-organisation.”The report claims:“Based on our calculations, around 3,392 BCH may have been successfully double spent in an orchestrated transaction reversal. However, the only victim with respect to these double spent coins could have been the original ‘thief.’”As BitMex Research reports, the above three issues during the hard fork resulted in 25 transactions (moving 3,392 BCH) not being included in the reorganized chain, which constitutes a double spend.As Cointelegraph reported at the time, the bitcoin SV (BSV) blockchain — the result of a previous BCH hard fork — struggled with its large block size following a series of block reorganizations in April.In January, a deep reorganization of the ethereum classic (ETC) blockchain, which reportedly included double spending, involved more than $1.1 million worth of crypto."

The setup panel will also display the logo of Cryptohopper in another attempt to trick the user.Running the installer is said to install the Vidar information-stealing Trojan, which further installs two Qulab trojans for mining and clipboard hijacking. The clipper and miners are then deployed once every minute in order to continuously collect data.The Vidar information-stealing trojan itself will attempt to scrape user data such as browser cookies, browser history, browser payment information, saved login credentials, and cryptocurrency wallets. The information is periodically compiled and sent to a remote server, after which the compilation is deleted.The Qulab clipboard hijacker will attempt to substitute its own addresses in the clipboard when it recognizes that a user has copied a string that looks like a wallet address. This allows cryptocurrency transactions initiated by the user to get redirected to the attacker’s address instead.This hijacker has address substitutions available for ether (ETH), bitcoin (BTC), bitcoin cash (BCH), dogecoin (DOGE), dash (DASH), litecoin (LTC), zcash (ZEC), bitcoin gold (BTG), xrp, and qtum.One wallet reportedly associated with the clipper has received 33 BTC, or $258,335 at press time, via the substitution address ‘1FFRitFm5rP5oY5aeTeDikpQiWRz278L45,’ although this may not all have come from the Cryptohopper scam.As previously reported by Cointelegraph, a YouTube-based crypto scam campaign was discovered in May, luring in victims with the promise of a free BTC generator. After users ran the alleged BTC generator, which was automatically downloaded by visiting the associated website, they would be infected with a Qulab trojan. Then, the Qulab trojan would attempt to steal user information and run a clipboard hijacker for crypto addresses."

Both companies have rebuffed the allegations and have contested the NY OAG’s injunction order.Bloomberg further cites TokenAnalyst’s data, which reportedly reveals that Bitfinex has had net outflows of over $1.7 billion in bitcoin and ether (ETH) since April 26 — the date of the NY OAG’s court filings. It also claims that bitcoin traded at a premium of as high as 6% in the controversy’s fallout — even as other coins saw losses given tether’s (USDT) prevalence as an intermediary asset throughout markets.Bloomberg states that the premium broke this week, after reports that Bitfinex had successfully raised $1 billion in fresh investment via a private token sale of new native exchange LEO tokens.John Griffin — a finance professor at the University of Texas at Austin — told Bloomberg that “since Tether is insufficiently backed, it means that some of the reserves backing customer assets on exchanges are likely insufficient.” He thus noted that:“Smart customers will not custody their funds on exchanges and pull their crypto off exchanges. This could put further upward pressure on Bitcoin prices as one would rather take fake money and exchange it to Bitcoin.”As previously reported, Professor Griffin was one of the co-authors of a high-profile study of tether’s alleged role in manipulative market practices, publishing a paper in June 2018 that claimed tether was being “used to provide price support and manipulate cryptocurrency prices” — artificially deflating the price of bitcoin to maximize short-term returns on futures contracts."

In using Ripple’s XRP token for such transfers, xRapid can purportedly settle such transactions faster than with fiat currencies or other major digital assets. MoneyGram Chairman and CEO Alex Holmes said:“Through Ripple’s xRapid product, we will have the ability to instantly settle funds from U.S. dollars to destination currencies on a 24/7 basis, which has the potential to revolutionize our operations and dramatically streamline our global liquidity management.”According to its website, MoneyGram is the second largest payments firm in the world, operating in over 200 countries. Much of MoneyGram’s business is in the global remittances market, the value of which is estimated to be worth $600 billion.In March, India’s Federal Bank (IFB), a commercial private bank, partnered with Ripple to use its network for cross-border remittances. The partnership was part of an initiative to apply new technologies to IFB’s remittances network, having also launched two platforms in the United Arab Emirates for making payments to India.Earlier this month, Ripple launched a Brazilian office with the goal of expanding across Latin America.

The organization said that many of the features and risks of cryptocurrencies are similar to those of foreign currency. The society further argued:“...while no government backs cryptocurrencies, the ‘gold standard’ is long gone, and governments only influence, but do not really back, their own respective currencies. Instances of massive currency devaluation are not infrequent and well known. And while bitcoin is not legal tender in the U.S., neither is Canadian dollar, or any other foreign currency.”CalCPA thus urges the FASB to initiate a project for accounting cryptocurrencies and add it to the Board’s or Emerging Issues Task Force’s technical agenda, since it believes that digital currencies will continue to expand in both volume and new fields of application.Authorities in various spheres are seeking regulatory clarity for cryptocurrencies. CalCPA’s request follows a bipartisan letter from 21 U.S. congressmen to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS), requesting guidance on how to report taxes virtual currency.The letter urged the IRS to provide guidance on tax consequences and basic reporting requirements for taxpayers that use cryptocurrencies, claiming that there is still “substantial ambiguity on a number of important questions about the federal taxation” of the emerging type of asset.In response to the request, IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig stated that the agency has prioritized issuing relevant guidance. The instruction will specifically cover issues such as acceptable methods for calculation cost basis, cost basis assignment; and tax treatment of forks."

More than 80% of those surveyed were United States-based institutions, with the rest of the respondents coming from the United Kingdom and Canada.What is most exciting about the survey is that a whopping 54% of respondents said that they “directly invested in cryptocurrencies though the assets themselves.”The other 46% said they gained their exposure through products offered by crypto funds.On Oct. 10, 2018, another report published by a technology news site indicated that multiple prestigious and Ivy League universities in the U.S. had made investments in cryptocurrency funds. Although the report cited an anonymous source, it revealed that “Harvard University, Stanford University, Dartmouth College, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and the University of North Carolina” had all invested capital in the crypto space.Furthermore, Yale University (another Ivy League school) was revealed to have dabbled in the crypto space with an investment that helped Paradigm (a digital currency fund) raise $400 million.With nearly $30 billion in its endowment fund, Yale is believed to be the second-largest endowment after Harvard's $39.2 billion endowment.Even though most universities are financed by the government, educational institutions also get much of their income from the courses they teach. But, unbeknownst to most, these institutions also operate lucrative money machines in the form of endowment funds; that aim to provide supplementary income.Endowment funds come from donations that are given to colleges and universities for the purpose of investment. The institution holds the principal of the investment in perpetuity while making annual payments of about 4-5% to the university’s annual expenditures.With a dual goal of growing the principal as well as generating income, endowment funds have become accustomed to a strict set of guidelines. These guidelines are designed to dictate the allocation of funds. For a long time, the overall principle for most endowment funds was to yield returns while taking the least amount of risk.That was the norm until the appointment of David Swensen over Yale’s endowment in 1985. By reducing the endowment’s commitment to U.S. stocks and bonds from 75% in 1988 to 14% in 2008, Swensen successfully managed to grow Yale’s endowment from a little over $1 billion to its current worth that is just a few points shy of the $30 billion mark.Swensen’s success over the years sparked a revolution in the university endowments space, prompting a move from traditional stocks and bonds to the so-called “alternative assets” (investments that include natural resources, private equity and real estate). Following Swensen’s success, other endowments — such as Harvard’s — were also able to generate huge returns over the years.The two decades leading to the financial crisis of 2008 have presented endowments good alternative assets. Subsequently, we can assume that endowment managers like Swensen have acknowledged that what worked in the past may not work in the future. Therefore, endowments have started devising new investment strategies in an effort to stay afloat.Although respondents form the survey conducted by Golden Custodian acknowledge the risks that the cryptocurrency market is currently facing, only 7% of the respondents anticipate an annual decrease in the funds they have invested.Endowments are showing strong bullish signals by factoring in crypto-related investments into their allocation, without a thought of stepping away anytime soon.In fact, on April 11th, Bloomberg reported that Havard University’s endowment, in conjunction with other investors, has invested a cumulative of about $98.5 million into Blockstack’s token sale.Blockstack is a crypto-based company that is seeking $50 million through its digital-token offering. The funds are set to go into enabling Blockstack to support the development of its own decentralized computing network.According to the SEC filing for the Reg A+ offering from Blockstack, Harvard’s endowment allocation amount sits between $5 million and $10 million. These are funds invested directly into the startup’s token sale, meaning the Ivy League’s endowment is holding some of Blockstack’s tokens.BREAKING: Harvard’s endowment invested $5M - $10M directly into Blockstack’s token sale.This means that one of the leading university endowments is comfortable holding tokens directly.THE VIRUS IS SPREADING 🔥Another university endowment investment in 2019 is the University of Michigan (UoM). With a $119 million endowment, this university is reportedly planning to increase its stake in an Andreessen Horowitz-managed crypto fund.In June last year, the University of Michigan’s endowment invested $3 million to the fund. Although details about the amount were not revealed, UoM’s endowment confirmed its dedication to inject additional investment into the Andreessen Horowitz’s (also called a16z) fund dedicated to crypto.Following the move by UoM’s endowment fund, most onlookers like David Nage (a former family office investor) believe that the rationale that drives the University of Michigan’s interest in crypto is too bullish for the ecosystem. In a posted tweet, Nage mentioned:“University of Michigan’s Endowment invested in a16z crypto back last year but has approved follow on investment recently. The rationale listed below I find interesting and bullish for the ecosystem.”From Nage’s point of view, the huge interest in crypto-based ventures by significant endowments has validated retail investors to stay bullish despite the market experiencing the most extended bear phase.In fact, people are beginning to wonder whether the huge interest in crypto by endowments is healthy. With Bloomberg’s Galaxy Crypto Index hitting its most overbought mark since last year, experts have started to warn that crypto prices are about to collapse once again.As it stands, Swensen’s model of investing has become the investment yardstick for endowments to follow, but only a few schools have managed to pull off what Yale's endowment has accomplished.According to a study conducted with a sample of over 28,000 endowment funds in the U.S., “Major endowments in the United States are [actually] underperforming.” Study says:“The median annual return for the entire endowment sample was 3.75 percent or 1.14 percent below the 10-year treasury bond return.""The researchers acknowledge significant exceptions such as Yale, but they still support the conclusion that college endowments are better off buying treasuries instead.Contrary to expert opinion, however, is Anthony Pompliano, the founder of crypto fund Morgan Creek, who believes that “there’s a belief in the institutional world that if the industry will be around for a long time, it will be very valuable.” He further pointed out:“The smart money is not distracted by price [volatility] but looks at the long-term trends, and believes they’re betting on innovation as a great way to deliver risk-mitigated returns.’’The reality of investing in crypto is that it forces endowment investment officers to adapt to a whole new set of issues. After all, crypto bets are very different from taking equity stakes in regular startups.While speaking to CNBC last year, Bill Barhydt, the CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Abra, said:“People are excited about it but afraid of being the first, or having to explain themselves. That’s the fear vs. greed of institutional investing. There’s a herd mentality there as much as there is in retail investing.”Indeed, compared to regular retail investors, institutional investors are not completely different. While individual retail investors will conduct due diligence before investing, these institutional investors are usually backed by large organizations that require robust conduct in each of their investments, plus a deeper level of due diligence.That is why most onlookers believe that the confidence in crypto as shown by the world’s leading endowments might lead to increased high-profile institutional investment in the cryptocurrencies world by other institutional investors, as was the case in 2017. The only difference is that this time, it will be better controlled.Already, the new interest in the digital coin space by endowments has brought with it a wind of moderate comeback across the crypto market. So far, ether and bitcoin have gained over 66% and 73% respectively this month alone, and XRP — the third-largest cryptocurrency in terms of market cap — has rallied by 48%.Caption: One month performance of the crypto market. Source: coin360.comApart from jumping onto the crypto bandwagon, universities and colleges have grown in their appreciation and understanding of blockchain technology as well. From MIT to Cornell and even Stanford, blockchain courses are growing in popularity everyday. All over campuses, blockchain technology is touted as the next revolution that is set to be as huge as the internet.But, while it is easy for universities to offers courses on blockchain and crypto, what has caught many by surprise is the fact that universities are willing to put their money where their mouth is. Nothing is as powerful as showing your support for an emerging technology than with your wallet.Granted, the investment arm of any university is typically independent of the academics, the move by endowment investors like Swensen, however, is a strong signal that blockchain and cryptocurrencies are here to stay."

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.","The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.The total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies had come scaringly close to breaking down below the $100 billion mark in mid-December of last year. At that time, sentiment was very weak and every rally was being sold on. There were talks of cryptocurrencies never seeing their lifetime highs again.However, fast forward seven months and total market capitalization is inching towards the $300 billion mark. Every dip is being bought aggressively and a few cryptocurrencies have already gone on to make new highs. The sentiment has changed within a short span of time.While the underlying fundamentals had been improving throughout 2018, a few notable events have helped to speed up the recovery of 2019. One among them is the launch of Facebook’s secretive cryptocurrency, Libra. The company is expected to announce the list of the Libra Association founding members and launch the testnet of its blockchain on June 18.Along with Facebook’s crypto project, the markets are also eagerly awaiting the launch of TON, the blockchain platform being developed by messaging app Telegram. With Bakkt having announced a date for bitcoin futures testing in June, hopes are high that the platform will also soon start operations. Unless these events fail to live up to expectations, a sharp fall is unlikely. Let’s look at the top five performers among the major cryptocurrencies in the past seven days.Neo (NEO) co-founder Da Hongfei had recently announced a new $100 million EcoBoost fund that aims to provide support to various projects at different stages of development to build the NEO ecosystem. The first phase of the project has kicked off wherein official partners will be recruited.The recent upgrade of its consensus algorithm on its mainnet is a key step in the development of NEO 3.0, which is expected to be released by the second quarter of next year. Can these developments prop prices higher? Let’s find out.The NEO/USD pair has not shown any fireworks in its rise from the bottom. After every small upwards move, it enters into consolidation before rising again. This looks like an accumulation by stronger hands. The price has sustained above 20-week EMA for the past three weeks and the RSI has rallied into the positive territory, which shows that bulls are in command.Currently, the pair is facing stiff resistance at the 50-week SMA, above which the rally can extend to $20. If this level is also crossed, a move to $25 is probable. The cryptocurrency will pick up momentum if it makes a large range move and follows it up with further gains. Traders can watch for such a move before hopping on to benefit from the positive momentum.Our bullish view will be invalidated if the price reverses direction from the current level and plummets below the 20-week EMA. The next support to watch on the downside is $8.17090666.Litecoin (LTC) has continued to perform well on the back of its upcoming halving, which is 50 days away. In a sign of growing adoption, Glory kickboxing is not only accepting litecoin, but it is also offering an opportunity to pick up a VIP ticket by paying using the cryptocurrency. This adoption is a positive sign. However, after the runup, is it time to book profits or can it move higher? Let’s find out.The digital currency has cleared the resistance line of the ascending channel and is now attempting to ascend the overhead resistance at $140.3450. If successful, it can rally to its target objective of $158.91, above which the upward move can extend to $184.7940.We have spotted a large rounding bottom that is developing on the LTC/USD pair. This bullish setup will complete on a breakout and close (UTC time frame) above $184.7940, with a target objective of $346.498. However, we will not get overly bullish until the pattern completes.The 20-week EMA is sloping up and the RSI has entered into the overbought zone, which shows that the bulls are in command. Nonetheless, the overbought nature of the RSI points to a mild correction or a consolidation in the short-term.If the pair turns down from the current levels or from $140.3450, the bulls will try to defend the support line of the ascending channel. If successful, the uptrend will continue, otherwise, the pair might re-enter the channel. The uptrend will weaken and our bullish projections will be negated if the bears sink the cryptocurrency below the support line of the channel.Bitcoin (BTC) is on fire as every dip is being bought aggressively. Some of the critical news and events that might be helping the rise are the upcoming testing of futures trading on the Bakkt platform, the end of the bear market, the ongoing trade war between China and the U.S., the reported launch of Facebook’s own stablecoin, etc. Can the rally continue and force the investors sitting on the sidelines to jump in, or will the rally fizzle out near the overhead resistance? Let’s find out.The BTC/USD pair is looking strong with the 20-week EMA sloping up and the RSI in overbought territory: this suggests that bulls are in command. The pair has broken out of the recent high at $9,053.12 and will now attempt to reach the next overhead resistance of $10,000. This is a psychological resistance where we anticipate a consolidation or a minor correction.However, the sentiment has become positive and any favorable news is likely to attract buyers. The traders who are waiting to buy at lower levels are feeling left out. Hence, if the bulls propel the price above $10,000, the momentum can pick up and can carry the pair to $12,000.Currently, there is no negative setup on the chart. The first indication of exhaustion will be if the bears sink the cryptocurrency below $7,413.46. That can drag the price towards the 20-week EMA and below it to the critical support of $5,900.Enigma released the testnet of its discovery network and the developers can now build decentralized applications that can be deployed immediately once Enigma goes live on the Ethereum (ETH) mainnet . In a first, Coinbase has also added a course on the Ethereum-based stablecoin dai (DAI) to its Coinbase Earn platform. This provides an opportunity for enthusiasts to know more about the token and earn some DAI. Can ether breakout of the overhead resistance and head higher?The ETH/USD pair is consolidating roughly between $225 and $300 for the past three weeks. This is a positive sign as it shows demand close to $225. The moving averages are on the verge of a bullish crossover, which indicates a change in trend.The longer the consolidation, the stronger the eventual breakout from it will be. If the bulls push the price above $307.67, it is likely to start a new uptrend that can carry the pair to $500, which is likely to act as a stiff resistance.Our bullish assumption will prove to be wrong if the bears defend the overhead resistance zone of $280 to $307.67 and sink the cryptocurrency below the moving averages.A web address is spreading a botnet that installs a monero (XMR) mining component and also holds DDoS capabilities, according to cybersecurity firm Trend Micro. However, in a positive for monero, the CEO of Binance tweeted that if India pushes through the crypto bill, the crypto enthusiasts of the country might shift to privacy coins.The XMR/USD pair has been consolidating between $81 and $100 for the past three weeks, which is a positive sign. The price has sustained above both moving averages, which are likely to complete a bullish crossover. This will indicate a change in trend.If the bulls push the price above $100, a rally to $150 in the medium-term is probable. It is unlikely to be a straight dash to this level as the cryptocurrency might face minor hiccups at $114.840 and $128.650. However, if the sentiment remains positive, these levels will be crossed.The first sign of weakness will be a breakdown and close (UTC time frame) below $81. That can drag the price lower to the 20-week EMA and below it to $60.147.The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange."

The news was reported by Moon’s official Twitter on April 22.,"While Moon’s regular Chrome browser extension is already available on the Chrome web store, the startup tweeted to note that the lightning feature update is still under review, and is expected to launch imminently.As previously reported, the bitcoin Lightning Network is a second-layer solution to bitcoin’s scalability limitations, opening payment channels between users that keep the majority of transactions off-chain, turning to the underlying blockchain only to record the net results.With Moon serving as intermediary, e-commerce sites like Amazon notably will not handle or process the crypto directly. Rather, Moon will process users’ lightning payments and convert them into fiat currencies, before settling the transaction with a given e-commerce merchant, according to Coindesk.Moon CEO and founder Ken Kruger underscored to the crypto media outlet that “there’s no direct merchant integration” with e-commerce sites such as Amazon, outlining that:“We’re integrating with the Visa and Mastercard networks and we get a cut of the interchange fees that merchants pay every time they receive a credit card transaction.”In a discussion of the extension’s functionality, Kruger revealed that at checkout, users will be provided with a QR code that contains the lightning invoice. Having made their payment, they will be redirected back to the regular payments confirmation page of the e-commerce site.  Consumers who want to use their crypto holdings to shop at e-commerce sites like Amazon are also able to use other third party extensions such as Purse.io, or apps like Gyft and eGifter to buy Amazon gift cards with cryptocurrency.As previously reported, blockchain development firm Lightning Labs announced the initial release of the Lightning Network offramp Lightning Loop this March, providing a non-custodial way to receive funds via the network.That same month, Bitcoin mining and development firm Bitfury entered into a partnership with United States payments processor startup HadePay to allow its merchants to accept Lightning Network transactions."

Gox users, the message reportedly says:“The creditors who objected to your self-approved rehabilitation claim withdrew their objections. As a result, the approval of your self-approved rehabilitation claim has become effective, and you no longer need to file an application for claim assessment.”The email screenshot was shared on Reddit by DerEwige, who accompanied the post with a screenshot of the alleged email written in both Japanese and English.DerEwige interpreted the email to mean that even Mt. Gox users who failed to fill out a rehabilitation claim after losing their bitcoin have had a claim automatically made in their name, which has now been approved.The Reddit user added that they were unsure about when any compensation would be paid, and exactly how much bitcoin affected users would receive.Cointelegraph has been unable to verify the veracity of this email. Two Mt. Gox creditors we spoke to said they have received no such message from the exchange.According to users in the MtGoxCreditors Telegram channel, self-admission claims that were not claimed in bankruptcy or civil rehabilitation were no longer objected to if the users were able to identify themselves.The Mt. Gox hack in 2011 — with the exchange shutting down only in 2014 — was the biggest bitcoin hack the world has seen, with 850,000 BTC (worth about $460 million at the time) stolen. The embattled exchange subsequently collapsed three years later, with 24,000 creditors out of pocket.In April, Mt. Gox’s trustee announced that all creditors who filed rehabilitation claims had received a decision, but warned the timing and method of repayment had not been determined."

Chinese people will use the RMB, only the RMB will become a cryptocurrency. The central bank of China will turn it into a digital currency.”When asked if decentralized exchanges can operate in China —  which has previously banned initial coin offerings (ICOs) — Tapscott said that they could, although the government has a serious stance towards curtailing digital currencies.Tapscott suggested that decentralized exchanges will eventually dominate centralized ones thanks to their purported ability to transparency and identify “bad behavior.” All assets, including traditional ones like securities, will purportedly be on decentralized exchanges, said Tapscott.Chinese authorities have long been discussing possible ban of cryptocurrency mining. The National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) has reportedly included crypto mining as part of its draft for a revised list of industrial activities the agency intends to shut down because they “lacked safe production conditions, seriously wasted resources, polluted the environment,” among other issues.However the country remains a major player in the bitcoin market, with most of the largest bitcoin mining pools controlled by local organizations. By mid-2018, crypto mining operator Bitmain reportedly operated as many as 11 mining farms in China, and hence would be largely affected by the NDRC’s reported plans.As for blockchain, China is reportedly leading the world in the number of blockchain projects currently underway in the country. There are 263 blockchain-related projects in China, accounting for 25% of the global total.Last month, a multi-year project called the “Implementation Plan for the Promotion of Transportation Infrastructure Development” was unveiled in Jiangsu Province. Per the plan, blockchain will be one of the technologies local authorities use in overhauling local transport infrastructure."

The study was conducted in Q4 2018 by trade publications Global Custodian and The Trade Crypto, in partnership with blockchain security firm BitGo.","Out of 150 surveyed endowments, 89% of the respondents were reportedly based in the United States, with the rest either in the United Kingdom or Canada.The survey indicated that despite widely-reported concerns around regulation, custody and liquidity, endowments will continue to allocate investments to the new asset class — with only 7% of respondents saying they anticipated any decrease in their allocations over the next year.Jonathan Watkins, managing editor at Global Custodian and The Trade, remarked on the results of the survey, stating that:“All the talk over the past 18 months has been around when institutional investors will begin participating in cryptocurrency investments, but it turns out they had already arrived, in the form of endowment funds.”The survey reportedly revealed that 54% of respondents were directly investing in crypto assets, with 46% investing via various kinds of funds.Over the next 12 months, 50% revealed they expect to increase their crypto investments, with 45% anticipating their allocations will remain at their current levels.According to the survey, the top three characteristics that endowments are seeking when they select crypto funds are that they comply with robust regulation, have sufficient capital flow and liquidity and offer account security.The Trade suggests cautious optimism is an apt overall summary of endowment sentiment in regard to the nascent asset class, citing one respondent’s belief that crypto “is the future of investing,” and others’ characterizations of the process as “a very wild ride” and “hair-raising.”As reported, this February, the University of Michigan’s $12 billion endowment unveiled plans to bolster its investment in a crypto fund managed by U.S. venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz.Details of reported crypto fund investments from Ivy League titans Yale and Harvard surfaced in fall 2018 — the latter of whose ~$39.2 billion endowment for the 2018 fiscal year was the largest of any university endowment globally. Crypto investment claims have also been made for Stanford University, Dartmouth College, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of North Carolina.As reported this month, Harvard’s endowment is set to become a direct investor in a planned $50 million token sale from decentralized computing network Blockstack.

Indeed, comments made about bitcoin at TechCrunch's Disrupt ...","Apr 29, 2019","Marketing loves celebrities — and with good reason. They're “celebrated” people, individuals invested with bulk quantities of cultural capital (i.e., public respect, goodwill and interest), which — if tapped correctly by marketing firms — can be reflected onto endorsed products. This is why they've already proven important for the cryptocurrency industry, which has enlisted the likes of Lionel Messi, Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Steven Seagal for the purposes of drawing the public's attention toward initial coin offerings (ICOs) and new cryptocurrencies.","But while the above have simply been endorsements offered in return for what we can only presume were million-dollar fees, there are a number of other celebrities who support and have supported crypto more meaningfully. From Ashton Kutcher to Serena Williams, these are individuals who have actually bought crypto or invested in crypto-related startups. So instead of merely allowing their names and faces to be associated with altcoin X or exchange Y, they've provided an even stronger backing of crypto by actually putting skin in the game.However, as validating as it may be to hear of another celebrity staking their own money on the success of crypto, celebrity investments won't be enough on their own to drive widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies, since they still remain a relatively rare occurrence. Instead, the crypto industry and community still need to focus on the core fundamentals: building platforms that businesses and the general public actually want to use.On April 17, tennis champion Serena Williams became the latest celebrity investor in crypto. She revealed via her Instagram account that she’d secretly launched an investment company, Serena Ventures, in 2014. And more importantly for the cryptocurrency industry, she also revealed that this company had invested in Coinbase, making her a backer of one of the industry's biggest players.It's not known how much Serena Ventures has invested in America's biggest crypto exchange, although Williams has won nearly $90 million in prize money over the course of her career, while she earned around $18 million in endorsements between 2017 and 2018 alone. She therefore has fairly deep pockets, indicating that her investment in Coinbase could be substantial — if not monumental.Williams isn't the only celebrity to have stumped up venture capital for a crypto-related company. Arguably the most active celebrity investor in such companies is Ashton Kutcher, the actor and one-time Calvin Klein model who launched his own venture capital firm — A-Grade Investments — in 2010. Most notably, he invested an undisclosed sum in crypto transaction processor BitPay in March 2013, while in June 2014, his firm participated in a $12 million funding round for blockchain cybersecurity company BitGo, making it one of the most well-funded crypto-related companies at the time.These multiple investments indicate that Kutcher is a firm believer in cryptocurrency, as reinforced by his comments following the BitGo investment. ""People ultimately want to feel like their wealth is safe,"" he was quoted by Forbes as saying:""Bitcoins themselves are incredibly secure, however the means by which bitcoins are exchanged and stored can be vulnerable. That is why BitGo is such an amazing platform.""Indeed, comments made about bitcoin at TechCrunch's Disrupt conference in 2013 show that Kutcher has been a cryptocurrency devotee for over half a decade — and in recent years, additional investments have reconfirmed his interest in crypto. In 2015, he launched a new venture capital firm, Sound Ventures, which later went on to invest in Ripple (and then to donate XRP worth $4 million to Ellen DeGeneres' wildlife charity in 2018). Sound Ventures has also invested an undeclared amount of money in exchange platform Robinhood, which expanded in February 2018 to offering cryptocurrency trading.Kutcher may be the most committed and outspoken celebrity investor in cryptocurrencies and crypto-related businesses, but he isn't the only famous individual to be all-in when it comes to crypto. One other celebrity venture capitalist who flies slightly more under the radar is Nasir bin Olu Dara Jones, better known as the rapper ""Nas.” Nas launched QueensBridge Venture Partners (QBVP) in 2014, when the firm invested in Bitfury Group as part of a $20 million Series A investment round. QBVP has also invested in BlockCypher and, more recently, Coinbase and Robinhood, while Nas himself has gone on record as saying that ""Bitcoin will evolve into an industry as big, if not bigger, than the internet.""The mention of Robinhood here is interesting, because it seems to be a magnet for investments from celebrity-led funds. Aside from Nas (and Ashton Kutcher), the exchange platform also received funding in 2014 from rapper Snoop Dogg and actor Jared Leto, while in early 2018 it also benefited from funding from Jay-Z's Arrive Venture Capital. And speaking of celebrity overlaps in crypto-related investments, BitPay was on the receiving end of money not only from Ashton Kutcher, but also from famed investor/author/philanthropist Richard Branson, who took part in a $30 million Series A funding round in 2014.Such forays into cryptocurrency funding may not be massively common in the celebrity world, but the fact that they are made by celebrities rather than “ordinary” investors and entrepreneurs should provide some encouragement. That's because, in such cases, the investors concerned are highly public figures who aren't putting only their money on the line when they invest in Coinbase, Robinhood or BitPay, but also their reputations. What's more, as CryptoOracle CEO Lou Kerner told Cointelegraph, their reputations really help to drive wider interest in crypto, particularly if the investors concerned are genuinely enthusiastic about cryptocurrencies:""Investment from a celebrity like Serena Williams often generates press, which has value, but it's pretty ephemeral. There are some celebrity investors, like Ashton Kutcher, that really dig in, leverage their celebrity status to help the company, and add real value.""Other industry figures agree with this assessment. Artem Popov, the co-founder of blockchain-based investment service Roobee, also affirms that celebrity investments can boost public interest, so long as these investments come from individuals who are personally invested in the cryptocurrency space:""Celebrity investments certainly bring hype and make the startup in question more appealing in the eyes of the general public and retail investors. If played right, celebrity involvement can be beneficial, but I believe it should be viewed on case-by-case basis and not taken out of context. For instance, in the case of Serena Williams we're not talking about her directly supporting blockchain or Coinbase.""As Lou Kerner adds, such celebrities as Ashton Kutcher and Nas are ""the exception rather than the rule,"" since most of the celebrities who do associate themselves with crypto do so more in terms of superficial marketing endorsements. And there have been no shortage of these in recent years: Paris Hilton, Floyd Mayweather, DJ Khaled, Steven Seagal, The Game, T.I, Harry Redknapp, Ghostface Killah, Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez, Akon, Dennis Rodman and Shahbaz Khan have all rented their names out to cryptocurrency projects of one stripe or another. And what's interesting to note about such endorsements is that they were all for projects that were either likely to fail or downright fraudulent.In other words, the distinction between celebrity investments and celebrity endorsements provides a useful rule of thumb. Generally, a celebrity will invest their own money in a crypto-related project because they really believe it offers value and will succeed as a business proposition. However, their willingness to be paid for their “endorsement” of a project obviously has no bearing on whether they believe in it, since they will get paid regardless of its success. It's for this reason that individual investors and traders would be better off paying more attention to investments than to endorsements.But even if the number of celebrities who have actually invested in crypto projects can probably be counted on a few hands, there are also a number of celebrities who, rather than getting involved specifically in venture capitalism, have sought to invest in bitcoin, ether or some other cryptocurrency for their own personal advantage. These include the likes of Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, actor Hugh Laurie, rappers 50 Cent and Snoop Dogg, singer Mel B, actor Drew Carey, football player Richard Sherman and musician/actor Donald Glover.Once again, that such people are public figures with thousands or millions of admirers is largely a good thing for cryptocurrency, since their enthusiasm for crypto is likely to rub off onto their fans. As Diego Mourad, CEO of the decentralized stolen item-database S4FE, explained:""People tend to form their opinions and decisions based on their role models, which today are celebrities and not necessarily politicians, scientists or academics. Celebrities have followers, sometimes millions of them. So by just one celebrity turning their attention to cryptocurrencies, millions may be encouraged to look into that topic.""It's not surprising that celebrities have been drawn to crypto — and that crypto-related projects have been drawn to celebrities — because, not only are celebrities usually always open to earning a little extra money via endorsements, but many of them also like to maintain their “fashionable” images and branding by associating themselves with the latest trends and innovations. This is a big part of the reason why they've publicly come out in favor of cryptocurrencies, and given that a large number of them also have plenty of money and time to spare, it's once again no surprise that celebrities have been in a position to invest in crypto in one way or another.That said, it's possible to suggest that the involvement of celebrities isn't as beneficial to the industry as some might suppose. For one, it's clear that, in certain cases, the direct purchase of crypto and even the provision of venture capital by celebrities isn't as effective in enabling the industry to grow as the help provided by established investors and entrepreneurs.""For the core crypto community, however, the so-called 'whale' investors hold more importance,""Artem Popov said. He continued:""Being within the crypto and blockchain industry for long and driving it strongly forward, they bring much more value and trust to a project than just celebrities.""Popov claims that presale investments from large bitcoin holders could be more vital in supporting project’s launch and sparking community interest than anything most celebrities could have provided. And while such investments might not attract the wider public, it's generally the interest from seasoned crypto investors and the community that will help to build the new projects and products that ultimately will win mainstream adoption.Diego Mourad also explained:""In order to become the next step in our financial system, cryptocurrencies must prove their feasibility to the general public. Celebrities or not, this will be the one factor that will rule over the rise or decline of this new technology. Our society is still stuck in a primitive cash-transaction world and it will take some convincing to get them to move to the next step. Celebrities can help this become a reality, but the technology must prove it is worthy of becoming the next phase in our evolution."""

At present, it supports the exchange of Bitcoin and ZCash (ZEC).ZCash — which, at the time of writing, is the 22nd-largest cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization, according to CoinMarketCap — describes itself as a “privacy protecting digital currency built on strong science.” The coin’s founders say that its infrastructure ensures personal details remain completely confidential — all without compromising transaction data being posted to a public blockchain. “Selective disclosure features” also enable consumers to share transaction details for audit or compliance purposes.BitConvert says that it plans to support more cryptocurrencies in the not-too-distant future, all while remaining loyal to its mantra of “anonymous, fast, safe.” Ethereum — along with Monero, another coin that places an emphasis on privacy — are specifically named as two coins that are in the pipeline.The privacy-led exchange says that most transactions can be fully completed and confirmed within an hour — and in many cases, execution times can be as little as five to 30 minutes. While two block confirmations are required for Bitcoin, a total of five are needed for ZCash.BitConvert stresses that its rationale behind eliminating the need for creating a user account is to “fully protect privacy” — and to this end, no personal information is collected when a transaction is taking place, including IP addresses. The company says that it promises these features will not change “so long as our platform is operating,” in an attempt to build trust among users. Data such as the transaction hash, address and amount are kept on record — but this is only to ensure that support can be provided to the consumer in the event there is a complication with a payment.The company says it hopes to blend anonymity with simplicity. It monitors the best rates for Bitcoin and ZCash on a plethora of other platforms, such as Binance and Bitfinex, to ensure its users get the best deal.Given how BitConvert users do not have their own account, the platform says it has taken a strong stance on security — making sure that its services are protected using strong security protocols, while also striking partnerships with dependable trading platforms.BitConvert sets out the procedure for using its exchange in three simple steps. Firstly, users select the crypto trading pair they wish to use (at present, it is limited to Bitcoin and ZCash). From here, they set out how much crypto they wish to convert along with their wallet address. Finally, the user can send their funds to BitConvert and complete the exchange. When it comes to the destination for converted coins, the company recommends its clients “only use trusted services in order to avoid losing their funds.”Privacy has long been a buzzword in the crypto world — and contrary to popular belief, Bitcoin does not necessarily offer its users the anonymity they might expect. Instead, the leading cryptocurrency delivers something known as “pseudonymity,” meaning that consumers only have the opportunity to obfuscate their real identities rather than hide them altogether.Disclaimer.

The two are suspected of being responsible for long-term systematic theft of cryptocurrencies by maliciously obtaining access to other users’ accounts.The two allegedly created credential-stealing clones of major online cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets and sent links to those phishing sites on Telegram groups and other cryptocurrency-related communities. The two are also accused of being responsible for the 2016 Bitfinex hack, which saw multiple accounts being compromised.As Cointelegraph reported at the beginning of June, the funds stolen in the attack above have been recently moved.The police noted that the alleged victims were mostly based out of the European Union and the United States, which resulted in the matter being investigated by multiple law enforcement agencies in several countries.During the raid, the police reportedly found a cryptocurrency wallet containing significantly less funds than the amount that the two are believed to have stolen. Finance Magnates also notes that Eli Gigi is a graduate of an elite technological unit of the Israel Defence Forces that selects youth with outstanding academic capabilities.As Cointelegraph reported earlier this week, a recent Firefox zero-day security flaw was used in attacks against major crypto exchange and wallet service Coinbase. The flaw was purportedly merged with another zero-day flaw targeting Coinbase employees, meaning that there were two separate attacks.While Coinbase was affected, the exchange’s security researcher Philip Martin stated that Coinbase was not the only crypto-related company targeted in the campaign and that there was no evidence of the campaign targeting exchange customers."

The bank previously banned financial institutions from conducting any operations with cryptocurrencies, as well as making investments in such an asset.The bank is purportedly concerned about the anonymity of the sender and receiver in a cryptocurrency transaction, which it worries increases the risk of digital assets’ use in money laundering. A source familiar with the matter told Vientiane Times that authorities do not have a relevant security system to protect cryptocurrency owners.While some countries like, Canada, Malta and Switzerland have embraced the new asset class to varying degrees, officials around the globe are still expressing skepticism toward crypto, while some hardliners call for outright bans.In the United States, where the legal status of crypto can vary state-to-state, California Congressman Brad Sherman recently called for a full ban on cryptocurrencies. Sherman claimed that crypto presents a threat to the power of the U.S. dollar to affect world economic developments.In April, Cointelegraph reported that the Indian government was considering a complete ban of cryptocurrencies under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act since it could purportedly be used for money laundering. The Ministry of Corporate Affairs reportedly stated that cryptocurrencies are used in fraudulent schemes to “defraud gullible investors”.That same month, news broke that Pakistan — which banned cryptocurrency trading last April — is implementing new cryptocurrency regulations in an effort to improve its track record in fighting financial crime. The move was reportedly in part a reaction to demands from international monitoring body the Finance Action Task Force, which has repeatedly voiced concerns about cryptocurrencies’ role in terrorist financing."

securely store reserves of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. Cold wallets ...","Jun 18, 2019",This article was updated to reflect that Bitrue has now acknowledged the hack of its platform.,"Throughout the past six months, seven crypto exchanges have reportedly seen large-scale hacking attacks to the tune of tens of millions of dollars, with the most recent platform to suffer a security breach being GateHub.As the global crypto exchange market continues to see an increasing number of security breaches leading to the loss of user funds, investors may become reluctant to rely on centralized exchanges to store funds.The month of June was characterized by two unfortunate cryptocurrency thefts. On June 26, Singapore-based cryptocurrency exchange Bitrue has acknowledged the fact that it suffered a major attack in which 9.3 million XRP and 2.5 million ADA worth around $5 million at the time were stolen from the exchange’s hot wallets. The statement read:“A hacker exploited a vulnerability in our Risk Control team's 2nd review process to access the personal funds of about 90 Bitrue users.”The exchange also clarified in the thread that all users who lost their digital assets will be compensated, while also apologizing for initially misleading their users by saying that the platform was down for maintenance. Bitrue also provided a link to track the movement of the stolen funds and also acknowledged that it reached out to Singaporean authorities in order to track down the culprits.As reported by Cointelegraph on June 6, the United Kingdom and Slovenia-based crypto exchange GateHub reported the loss of nearly $10 million worth of XRP.In an update published on June 7, the GateHub team noted that an unidentified hacker used a sophisticated method to gain access to a database holding users’ access tokens and steal their funds. In the aftermath, GateHub said:“Through a well-orchestrated attack, the perpetrator gained access to a database holding valid access tokens of our customers. We detected an increased volume of API calls (using these valid access tokens) coming from a small number of IP addresses.”The exchange told its users that it will cooperate with its internal response team, law enforcement agencies, third-party professional security and forensics teams, and investigative authorities to analyze the breach and to potentially find the individual or a group responsible for the breach.Over the years, despite the efforts of exchanges to ramp up security measures and improve internal management systems, hackers have been able to deploy more sophisticated and advanced technologies to gain unauthorized access into corporate wallets and user accounts.In some instances, as seen in the case of Binance’s $40 million security breach, it is difficult even for the biggest crypto exchanges in the world — with in-house security experts — to prevent unexpected breaches.However, it is possible for exchanges to set up systems that allow for the speedy recovery of user funds.Related reading: The Cryptopia Nightmare Drags on as Liquidators Struggle to Reimburse Hacked UsersBinance, for instance, established the Secure Asset Fund for Users (SAFU) in July 2018 to compensate users in the unlikely event of a hacking attack. Binance said in July 2018:“Starting from 2018/07/14, we will allocate 10% of all trading fees received into SAFU to offer protection to our users and their funds in extreme cases. This fund will be stored in a separate cold wallet.”Two types of wallets exist in crypto: hot wallets and cold wallets. Hot wallets are wallets that are connected to the internet and that are easily accessible. Cold wallets are wallets stored offline and are used by major exchanges to securely store reserves of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin.Cold wallets cannot be hacked because they are not connected to the internet — and as such, exchanges hold the overwhelming majority of their reserves in cold wallets.Still, despite having advanced security measures in place, hot wallets can be vulnerable to attacks, so it is ideal for an exchange to establish an insurance fund that is equivalent to the amount held in its hot wallet to prevent a security breach in the future affecting the exchange’s operations.Such a practice does not prevent an exchange from suffering a hacking attack, but it minimizes the magnitude of an incident's impact on the exchange and facilitates the recovery process to be more structured and apparent.The largest crypto exchanges in the global market — the likes of Binance, Coinbase and Gemini — have either obtained insurance from third-party service providers or have internal insurance funds in place to compensate users, should an unexpected incident arise.Coinbase, for example, notes that it maintains a reserve that is larger than its online storage with third-party insurance. The insurance document of Coinbase reads:“Coinbase maintains commercial criminal insurance in an aggregate amount that is greater than the value of digital currency we maintain in online storage. Our insurance policy is made available through a combination of third-party insurance underwriters and Coinbase, who is a co-insurer under the policy.”Gemini obtained the insurance services of Aon and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in October 2018, and Yusuf Hussain, Gemini’s head of risk, said at the time:“Consumers are looking for the same levels of insured protection they’re used to being afforded by traditional financial institutions. Educating our insurers not only allows us to provide such protections to our customers, but it also sets the expectation for consumer protection across the crypto industry.”Since hot wallets or online storage can become vulnerable to security breaches, it is of the utmost importance for exchanges to establish a line of communication with other platforms to trace and potentially freeze transactions when suspicious funds begin to move.According to the GateHub team, some of the funds stolen in the $10 million security breach were sent to exchanges such as Kucoin, Huobi and HitBTC, all of which have Know Your Customer (KYC) policies in place. GateHub acknowledged this fact:“The funds were sent to several exchanges, including Freewallet.org, Changelly, Changenow, Kucoin, Huobi, Exmo, Hitbtc, Binance, Alfacashier and others. We have already contacted each recipient exchange with the aim to freeze and retrieve all customer assets.”If exchanges have an efficient system to communicate when unforeseen events occur, it becomes possible for them to immediately suspend wallets that received the proceeds from a potential hacking attack and swiftly begin recovering funds.In January 2018, South Korea’s four largest crypto exchanges — Bithumb, Upbit, Coinone and Korbit — created a hotline for major exchanges to ensure suspicious transactions could be detected and frozen immediately after being disclosed.Transactions on public blockchain networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum are traceable due to the decentralized structure of the blockchain. Major exchanges are already working with analytics firms such as Chainalysis to maintain a database of suspicious transactions and wallets.The presence of a hotline among major crypto exchanges in the global market would create a significantly more impractical ecosystem for hackers to distribute proceeds from an attack to various exchanges.In previous years, most crypto-related hacking attacks were suffered by minor exchanges that typically could not afford to have an in-house security team and advanced measures in place.However, in the past six months, major crypto exchanges such as Binance, Bithumb and Coinmama have all fallen victim to security breaches, all of which have well over hundreds of thousands of users.Bithumb, which is considered to be one of the two biggest crypto exchanges in South Korea (alongside UPbit), was hacked in March for the third time in two years, in what the exchange suspects to be an insider job.The Bithumb team said:“According to the company's manual, Bithumb secured all the cryptocurrency from the detection time with a cold wallet and checked them by blocking deposit and withdrawal service. As a result of the internal inspection, it is judged that the incident is an ‘accident involving insiders’. Based on the facts, we are conducting intensive investigations with KISA, Cyber Police Agency and security companies.”Last year, cybersecurity company Group-IB reported that seven crypto exchanges were hacked in 2018, with the largest breach suffered by Coincheck leading to the loss of a staggering $534 million worth in crypto.Less than six months into 2019, and already seven crypto exchanges have been successfully hacked — excluding the CoinBene incident, which some suspect may also be a hacking attack.Related to this: Major Crypto Exchange in Korea Shut Down in April: 2018 Was a Nightmare for MostIn March, cryptocurrency researcher Nick Schteringard said that $6 million worth of coinbene coin and $39 million in maximine were stolen from the CoinBene exchange.Blockchain infrastructure firm Elementus said in a report that the funds were quickly sold for ether (ETH) on Etherdelta, fueling the suspicions of investors about the incident. According to the report:“After leaving CoinBene, the tokens were quickly moved into Etherdelta, where they were sold for ETH. A large amount of funds were also moved into centralized Exchanges, including Binance, Huobi, and Bittrex. The funds continue to move into exchanges as I write this.”In April, CoinBene stated that the movement of tens of millions of dollars in coinbene coin and maximine coin was due to a maintenance the exchange carried out, denying any cyber attacks on its platform.The worrying trend in the crypto exchange market is that, within the first six months of 2019, the industry has seen the same number of hacking attacks as in the whole of the previous year, and the security breaches in 2019 were mainly experienced by large-scale exchanges.In the upcoming months and years, the methods and technologies utilized by hackers will continue to become more sophisticated and advanced.While it is challenging to completely prevent unauthorized access, especially in the case of hot wallets, it is possible for exchanges to have proper insurance, an in-house security team and back-up reserves equivalent to the amount of crypto held in online storage to prevent users from being affected in the event of a security breach."

as soon as bitcoin achieved an all-time high at a price of $20,000.","May 16, 2019","The shutdown of Coinnest on April 18, one of the major crypto exchanges in South Korea, showcased the intense brutality of the 16-month bear market, which came crashing down as soon as bitcoin achieved an all-time high at a price of $20,000.","While not many major crypto exchanges have closed their operations in the past year, most exchanges — with the exception of some platforms considered to have real daily volumes by Bitwise Asset Management — have struggled to maintain a stable inflow of revenue.The bear market was particularly difficult for small exchanges that are known to strategically inflate their volumes to appeal to users on leading market data platforms like CoinMarketCap.Profit margins sharply dropped due to an overall drop in daily volumes for smaller exchanges such as Korbit in South Korea, creating a difficult environment to survive in.Cryptocurrency exchanges generate the overwhelming majority of their revenues through fees that occur when trades are executed. When daily volumes of crypto assets drop, exchanges suffer a dip in revenue.Top crypto exchanges in South Korea have reported contrasting results for April, with Upbit pulling in over $110 million in profit and Bithumb suffering over $150 million in losses.According to a report from The Block, Binance generated a quarterly profit of around $71 million from January to March 2019, nearing the annual operating profit of Upbit, South Korea’s largest crypto exchange.Upbit is the only exchange among the top five cryptocurrency exchanges in South Korea’s local crypto exchange market to record a profit in 2018.Bithumb recorded a net loss of $175 million, and other leading platforms like Coinone and Korbit also recorded relatively large losses in 2018 to the tune of tens of millions of dollars.Although a Bithumb representative told MK, a mainstream media outlet in South Korea, that the business of the exchange remains solid, a $175 million loss could have been critical for the exchange if it had not reportedly secured around $190 million in new funding:""Even during a phase in which the cryptocurrency market is struggling, Bithumb is sustaining a solid business with unique services and global market dominance. Bithumb will put in all efforts in protecting user funds.”2018 was particularly hard for exchanges in South Korea because exchanges were prohibited from accepting new registrations for awhile. As such, exchanges experienced a substantial decline in revenues.Last year was challenging even for Upbit, the country’s dominant leader in the cryptocurrency exchange market.A representative of Dunamu, the parent company of Upbit, said that the exchange was able to operate healthily throughout 2018 due to the company’s strategy of reducing marketing efforts and resources by employing a cautious approach in management.“In comparison to other exchanges, Upbit operated with caution by reducing marketing efforts and overall manpower because new registrations were blocked. Most of the revenues recorded by Upbit in 2018 were generated in the first quarter of 2018 when the cryptocurrency market was hot. Upbit actually recorded an increase in revenues and operating profit since 2017.”For smaller platforms like Coinnest, it was virtually impossible to expect any substantial operating income because of the sentiment around the market and the state of the cryptocurrency exchange market in South Korea.Coinnest specifically suffered more than others due to the exchange’s reported $5 million mishap in January, during which the exchange mistakenly sent more than $5 million to clients.  Moreover, on Oct. 18, the former CEO of Coinnest was sentenced to three years in prison and a $2.6 million fine for fraud and for extracting user funds for personal financial gain. According to court documents, the former CEO and two other executives stole more than $30 million from users and reportedly faked around $400 million in volume.Ultimately, citing regulatory uncertainty and a drop in crypto trading volume, a Coinnest representative said that the exchange was forced to close, a fall from grace for an exchange that was once the third biggest in the local market. The exchange’s representative said:“It is a natural result of a decrease in trading volume. Both regulatory issues and business decisions have served as a background for this decision.”Small exchanges across major markets like Japan and South Korea often get acquired by larger companies or declare bankruptcy because of their focus on short-term profitability.For exchanges, a strong network effect is crucial for sustainability. Hence, apart from the top five exchanges in every major region, most exchanges consistently struggle to generate profits.In a bear market, the situation gets worse for both small and large exchanges, as seen in the performance of Coinbase in 2018.On April 18, Reuters reported that Coinbase recorded an annual revenue of $520 million in 2018, which would normally be considered a healthy figure coming off of a brutal 85% correction of crypto assets.But, Coinbase is one of the biggest exchanges in the global market, and it failed to reach its projection by 60%:Net revenues of 520 million dollars with a ~40%+ profit margin for the year of 2018 is beyond excellent! Congratulations @coinbase team.Bloomberg said in October 2018 that Coinbase expected an annual revenue of $1.3 billion in 2018 despite the correction of the market. Given that the document was obtained by Bloomberg late last year, it is likely that the last quarter was distinctly agonizing for exchanges.Coinbase missed its annual revenue projection by a staggering 60% even with the continuous efforts of the exchange to increase the volume of the platform through the addition of new tokens and crypto assets.Throughout the past two years, major exchanges in strictly regulated markets, such as the United States, refrained from prematurely listing tokens due to regulatory uncertainty around the nature of tokens.In April alone, Coinbase listed tokens from Maker (DAI), Augur (REP) and EOSIO (EOS) on Coinbase Pro, following the listing of Stellar’s lumens (XLM) and the highly anticipated support for XRP, the cryptocurrency developed by Ripple.The Coinbase team said after listing lumens in March:“One of the most common requests we receive from customers is to be able to trade more assets on our platform. With the recent announcement of our new listing process, we anticipate listing more assets over time that meet our standards.”In South Korea alone, there are hundreds of cryptocurrency exchanges, with some reports estimating the number of exchanges in the country surpasses 100. Most of these exchanges are small companies that aim to drive short-term profits with aggressive token listings.Due to a lack of resources, when minor exchanges are hit with security breaches, hacking attempts or a drastic drop in trading volume in the cryptocurrency exchange market, they are unable to cope with changes in market conditions.Throughout the past 16 months, exchanges like Coinnest, Coinpulse and Liqui have shut down as a result of liquidity issues, and bigger platforms including QuadrigaCX, Coincheck and Zaif have closed following high-profile security breaches.While Coincheck and Zaif have reopened in Japan with the approval of the Financial Services Agency (FSA), the two firms needed a lifeline from bigger conglomerates to fully compensate all user funds.Zaif reopened on April 19 after securing a deal with Fisco worth around $44.5 million to compensate users affected by the hack.“After that, on condition of financial support of approximately 5 billion yen, transfer of Zaif business from Tech Bureau Co., Ltd. to us was decided. In addition, we have asked customers via the Internet and by telephone etc. for the procedures for consenting to business succession,” Fisco team said.Small exchanges often fall victim to hacking attacks because compliance and security cost a significant sum of money. Well-regulated platforms like Gemini have insurance, in-house security experts and regular audits in place to secure user funds. But small exchanges cannot afford similar resources as major companies.Even Coincheck, which was once the largest cryptocurrency exchange in Japan, did not have proper in-house security experts to oversee the platform:Main takeaways from Coincheck press conf:- only NEM impacted- plans to continue operating, restart trading- not clear on plan to repay customers- no multisig💀- wouldn’t admit security was weak- not sure how hacked, if domestic or foreign hackers- CEO barely spokeFormer Coincheck CEO Koichiro Wada said in April 2018:“We were aware we didn’t have enough people working on internal checks, management and system risk. We strived to expand using headhunters and agencies, but ended up in this situation.”Although an investigation is said to be ongoing in the QuadrigaCX scandal — during which Gerald Cotten, the CEO of the exchange, lost $190 million in crypto and other funds after he reportedly passed away with private keys — the Coinbase team speculated that QuadrigaCX may have also been affected by the bear market and faced liquidity issues. Brian Armstrong, the CEO of Coinbase, said:“QCX was one of the oldest exchanges in existence (founded in 2013). If they planned an exit scam, it likely would have been timed better. They suffered a multimillion dollar bug in June 2017. This is when we start to see movement of funds to ‘cold storages.’”Patterns of sends from cold storage suggest they tried keeping the exchange afloat, and maybe attempted to trade their way out of the hole. Liquidity dried out and the bear market of 2018 may have caught up with them. The sequence of events suggests this was a mismanagement with a later attempt to cover it up.The crypto bear market is crucial because it allows the industry to settle down, reflect, escape the speculative mania phase and rebuild the infrastructure around the market.During an extended correction, the prices of crypto assets plummet and the volume of the market drops, leaving many low-quality projects and exchanges with a few options.The cycle of the crypto market of speculation-correction-build-rally improves the quality of the industry and focuses the resources, capital and labor within the sector to quality companies."

The news was reported by Bloomberg on April 24.","McAfee — who founded the pioneering anti-virus firm McAfee Associates in 1987 — claims his technology expertise has helped him track down the real Satoshi. According to Bloomberg, McAfee said he had communicated with Nakamoto in recent days, alleging that the mystery figure is in fact a man living in the U.S. He reportedly stated:“My entire life I’ve been tracking people who are the best in the world, and hiding their identity. Finding Satoshi was a piece of cake for me.”McAfee reportedly further noted that the alleged Nakamoto “is not a happy camper about my attempt to out him.” Bloomberg adds that while McAfee had at first told the news agency he would make his disclosure within a week, he is now holding back over concerns that the move could make him the target of multiple lawsuits.Himself no stranger to controversy, McAfee has allegedly been indicted by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) over self-avowed tax avoidance, and could thus face potential extradition from the Bahamas, where he currently resides.In a tweet on April 23, McAfee said he was reluctant to wage a battle on multiple fronts, and would thus heed his lawyer’s advice to pull the brake on imminent plans to out Nakamoto:“The US extradition request to the Bahamas  is imminent. I met with Mario Gray, my extradition lawyer, and it is now clear [...] that releasing the identity of Satoshi at this time could influence the trial and risk my extradition. I cannot risk that. I'll wait.”As widely reported, Nakamoto’s sudden disappearance in late 2010 has spawned a myth almost as famous as the cryptocurrency he, she or they invented on October 31, 2008 with the publication of the bitcoin white paper.Parallel to McAfee’s recent claims, controversially self-proclaimed “Nakamoto” Craig Wright has recently published a blog on April 23, alluding to the widespread criticism he has faced in regard to his position and vowing to continue to develop crypto innovations that will place his team “in advance of any other player in the industry”:“By the end of this year I hope that we will have around 1,000 patents published [...] As you have been hiding and calling me names, I’ve been building and creating.”Bloomberg notes that McAfee told the agency that Wright is emphatically not the man he has tracked and identified as bitcoin’s creator.As Cointelegraph has reported, McAfee is meanwhile also planning to run for president in the 2020 United States elections as part of his crypto advocacy efforts. In light of his ongoing legal battles, he has pledged to run his campaign in exile from a boat in international waters."
