The price hopped the $10K barrier at 7:35pm Eastern Time.","At press time, the top cryptocurrency by market capitalization is trading at $$10,080.49 – the highest level since March 8, 2018 – representing month-to-date gains in excess of 13 percent, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.  On a 24-hour basis, BTC is outshining most top 10 cryptocurrencies with 7 percent gains.The price rise is backed by a 12 percent jump in trading volumes. As per data source CoinMarketCap, $21 billion worth of bitcoins have traded across cryptocurrency exchanges in the last 24 hours. Messari, however, is reporting the “Real 10” volume at $1.4 billion.With the move above $10,000, bitcoin has erased more than 40 percent of the sell-off seen in twelve months to December 2018.  Further, prices look set to end the second quarter with triple-digit gains. As of writing, BTC is up more than 130 percent on a quarter-to-date basis.Looking forward, BTC may continue to shine bright as the cryptocurrency is set to undergo mining reward halving sometime in May 2020.The process designed to curb inflation by reducing the reward for mining on bitcoin’s blockchain is repeated every four years and leads to supply deficit.The upcoming reward halving may leave a bigger supply deficit if Facebook’s cryptocurrency Libra ends up boosting bitcoin’s appeal and adoption rate as predicted by some observers.On Tuesday, the social media giant launched the white paper to mixed reviews with pundits it a net positive development for bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general.While bitcoin’s long-term prospects look bright, the cryptocurrency may see a pullback in the short-term. After all, prices have rallied more than 140 percent in the last 2.5-months and bulls usually take a breather following such stellar gains.Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency at the time of writingHot air balloon image via Shutterstock; charts by TradingView"

That, however, makes BTC vulnerable to “sell the fact” trading following the expected white paper launch on Tuesday.Binance.com, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by trading volume, updated its terms of use on June 14 to exclude all users in the U.S.The announcement led to a sharp sell-off in Binance’s very own native asset, Binance Coin (BNB). The price of BNB fell 12.8 percent to 25,209 satoshis (a satoshi being 0.00000001 of a BTC) on Friday, and hit a one-month low of 34,906 satoshis on Sunday.The slide indicates that investors have rotated money out of BNB and possibly into bitcoin, pushing the top cryptocurrency higher, as discussed by Alex Kruger – a prominent Fundamental & Technical Analyst.The upcoming litecoin (LTC) halving, set to trigger on August 5, 2019, will cut the reward gained from mining the cryptocurrency by half, meaning LTC will become a more scarce asset overall.”Halvings’ as they are known, typically result in an overall boost in value for the crypto markets, as the assets themselves become harder to obtain and therefore increase in value.Litecoin has already rallied 353 percent this year and may have added fuel to the ongoing bitcoin’s price rally. It is worth noting that litecoin led the broader markets higher in the first quarter, with 100 percent gains over the period.As noted earlier, bitcoin may see a pullback following Facebook’s announcement on Tuesday. The long duration charts, however, indicate that corrections, if any, could be short-lived.Bitcoin jumped 17.57 percent last week (above left), invalidating the bearish view put forward by the previous week’s close below $8,000.Further, the 5- and 10-week moving averages are trending north, indicating a bullish setup, while Chaikin money flow is reporting the strongest buying pressure since December with an above-0.32 reading.The bullish case looks stronger if we take into account the falling channel breakout on the monthly chart (above right).As a result, BTC could rise to $10,000 over the next few weeks. In the short-term, a price pullback cannot be ruled out.BTC printed 13-month highs above $9,300 on Sunday but failed to close above $9,097 – the high of the bearish outside reversal candle created on May 30.Another failure to secure a UTC close above $9,097 may trigger profit taking on long positions, leading to a price pullback to the 200-hour moving average (MA), currently at $8,300.Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency at the time of writingBitcoin image via Shutterstock; litecoin halving counter via Litecoin Blockhalf"

Prices did print a low of $7,449 on June 6 before closing at $7,806, according to Bitstamp data. Further, Sunday’s drop to $7,511 was short-lived with prices bouncing back to levels above $8,000 yesterday.At the same time, the bulls have repeatedly failed to force a sustained break above $8,000 over the last six days.With prices largely range-bound, the immediate outlook is neutral. A convincing break above the upper edge of the range is needed to put the bulls back in a commanding position. Conversely, a break below the lower edge would again open the doors for a deeper price pullback.As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $$7,820, representing a 1.2 percent gains on the day, having hit a high of $8,057 earlier today.BTC is trapped within a falling channel on the 4-hour chart, and the price bounce from Monday’s low of $7,511 has run out of steam.Further, the moving averages (MAs) are biased bearish. For instance, the 50-candle MA is trending south, having produced a bearish crossover with the 100-candle MA on June 7. The 50-candle MA now looks set to cross below the 200-candle MA.BTC, therefore, risks falling back toward the lower end of the recent trading range of $7,500–$8,100.The case for a pullback to $7,500 looks stronger if we take into account the fact that trading volumes dropped sharply in the last 24 hours as the price recovered from $7,500 to $8,090. As seen above, volume bars have been printing lower highs since May 30.The outlook would turn bullish if BTC exits the falling channel with a high-volume move above the upper edge of the channel, currently at $8,050.The previous week’s candle closed below $8,000, validating the bullish exhaustion signaled by the preceding week’s doji candle.Despite the bearish doji reversal confirmation, BTC is flashing green this week. Prices, however, are struggling to find acceptance above $8,000 – the doji candle’s low.The bearish view would gain credence if the rejection at $8,000 is followed by a drop below $7,500. In that case, a deeper slide to levels below $7,000 could be seen.Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.Bitcoin in a vice image via CoinDesk archives; charts by Trading View"

As of press time, the price has dropped back to above $12,500.The last time bitcoin (BTC) changed hands above $12,000 in January 2018, prices were on the way down, amid the beginnings of a down trending bear market. This time, things are much different.BTC continues to post impressive results up 40 percent in the month of June alone, while its year-to-year performance is up by more than 250 percent, according to data at Messari.io.The hourly chart reveals BTC’s recent movements in a bullish light as each breakout was backed by a strong showing of growing volume.As can be seen above, prices broke from an ascending triangle (typically bullish in nature) on June 25 at 21:00 UTC backed by consistent levels of growing volume, legitimizing the move on its rise northward.A secondary ascending triangle breakout brought prices well above $12,000 and continues to eye off $13,100 in the immediate short-term, as per Fibonacci Extension theory.The recent volatility may also see a short-term move to retest $12,500 given the levels of liquidity currently entering and exiting the markets in rapid succession.The weekly chart also reveals some interesting insights, detailing key levels of support and resistance at $11,500 and $13,700 respectively, whereby a close above or below those levels would dictate the direction of the trend for either a continuation or a pullback in its price.In addition, there has been a strong backing of weekly volume since the new year began, with the exception given to March, that saw below-average volume traded over the month. This is a good sign for the bulls as the moves are backed by strong liquidity and buying pressure.If momentum and market conditions maintain their current course, BTC could set its sights on $13,500 resistance in the coming days.Should prices fall below $11,500 then consider a retest of the $11,000 psychological support zone, overall the trend remains very bullish.Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency at the time of writing.Bitcoin image via Shutterstock; Charts via TradingView"

The move to another 2019 high comes after bitcoin’s price dropped to as low as $10,416 on June 23 before another surge of buying pressure pushed prices back above $10,750 within the same day.From then BTC bolstered 6 percent, rising above $11,000 at around 19:00 UTC on Sunday evening and then reaching over $11,300 two hours later. It’s currently changing hands at $10,768 as per CoinDesk’s price data.BTC’s 2019 bull run has already started off with a bang in recent weeks, a likely a combination of traders buying into their own fear-of-missing-out (FOMO) as well as institutions chasing the tail end announcement of Facebook’s project Libra.However, large levels of volume failed to accompany the rally, beginning at 97.6 billion traded over a 24-hour period and continued to decrease to as low as 67.5 billion by days end, meaning that the move was unsupported and a small sell-off from that point out, was definite.Its “Real 10” volume – a metric that takes into account trading volume from exchanges reporting honest volume figures as identified in a report by Bitwise Asset Management – currently stands at $46.17 billion, a large difference, according to Messari.io.Meanwhile, the rest of the market remains relatively flat today, with but a few in the top 20 posting gains. Cadano (ADA) and UNUS SED LEO (LEO) are the only two in the green within the top 20 at CoinMarketCap and are both posting 0.4-2.4 percent growth, respectively, over a 24-hour period.In addition, the total market capitalization rose to a high of $331.8 billion, its highest point since July 31, 2018, while the market capitalization for altcoins is down $3.8 billion over a 24-hour period pointing to a preference in holding BTC above all else amongst the trading elite.Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency at the time of writing.

After all, the average has consistently reversed price pullbacks over the last four months.This time, however, BTC, may not be able to rise all the way back to $9,000, as the short duration technical charts are biased bearish and the weekly chart is flashing signs of buyer exhaustion, as discussed yesterday.Further, the broader market is also looking exhausted. Notably, litecoin (LTC) is struggling to decouple from BTC with a move higher, even though it is set to undergo mining reward halving in August. The supply altering event tends to put a bid under the cryptocurrency months in advance.BTC breached the 30-day MA on Feb. 8 and has established multiple bullish higher lows (marked by arrows) along that line ever since. Notably, every bounce ended up violating the preceding price high.The price is again attempting a recovery from the 30-day MA as seen above. However, the bounce will likely be shallow or the cryptocurrency could find acceptance below the average later today, as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) has dipped below 54.50, confirming a double top breakdown – a bearish reversal pattern.The moving average convergence divergence (MACD) histogram is charting bigger bars below the zero line – a sign the bearish move is gathering strength.Further, the price drop seen in the last 24 hours validated the bullish-to-bearish trend change signaled by the bearish outside day candle created on May 30.The doji candle created last week represents buyer exhaustion. The 14-week RSI is also reporting overbought conditions with an above-70 print.Meanwhile, the money flow index – also known as volume-weighted RSI – has almost risen to 100 for the first time on record. A reading above 80 represents overbought conditions.The current print of 98, therefore, indicates the recent rally is extremely overstretched and significant correction is overdue.Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.Bitcoin image via Shutterstock; charts by Trading View"

However, much like Wednesday, the drop below the 4-hour chart’s 200-candle moving average (then located at $7,588) was short lived.With the rise back to $8,000, the cryptocurrency has charted a bullish technical pattern on one of the short-duration charts. As a result, the recovery rally may continue, with prices rising to $8,400 over the weekend.The weekly close (Sunday, as per UTC) will also be key. BTC witnessed solid two-way business last week before ending on a flat note, a sign of indecision among buyers. A short-term bearish reversal would be confirmed if prices close below last week’s low of $8,000 on Sunday.Bitcoin’s previous 4-hour candle closed out just above the resistance of $7,924, confirming a double-bottom breakout.The pattern essentially represents a bearish-to-bullish trend change. So, it seems safe to say the pullback from the May 30 high of $9,097 has ended and the path of least resistance is now to the higher side.It’s worth noting that a double-bottom breakout is usually followed by a move higher by roughly the length of the spread between the bottom and the neckline – in this case from $7,450 to $7,924, giving potential a rise of around $470.So, with breakout already confirmed, BTC could climb toward $8,400 over the weekend. On the way higher, BTC may face resistance at $8,350 – the upper edge of the falling channel representing bearish lower highs and lower lows.The rally, however, could be short lived if trading volumes remain anemic. As the above chart shows, trading volumes are locked in a downtrend despite the price recovery.BTC created a long-tailed doji candle on Thursday amid falling volume bars – another sign the pullback may be over.That said, the outlook would turn bullish only if prices see a high-volume UTC close above the 4-hour chart falling channel resistance, currently at $8,350. A channel breakout, if confirmed, would open the doors to $9,000.On the downside, the June 4 low of $7,432 is the level to beat for the bears. A violation there would put the focus back on the bearish divergence of the RSI and the downward sloping 5- and 10-day MAs and allow for a deeper drop to the 50-day MA at $6,915.The long-term outlook will remain bullish as long as prices hold above the May low of $5,263.Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.Bitcoin image via Shutterstock; charts by Trading View"

The cryptocurrency went on to hit an intraday low of $8,000 before printing a UTC close at $8,378.The sudden $1,100 pullback from one-year highs ended up engulfing the price action seen in the previous three trading days – a sign of buyer exhaustion.Further, prices closed below the key support of $8,390 (May 16 high), invalidating the bullish higher high established above that level on May 26.The price pullback looks to have legs, as trading volumes on Bitstamp doubled on Thursday as prices dropped. BTC, therefore, could remain on the defensive in the first week of June.However, the bulls may get a boost, as historical data shows the cryptocurrency tends to do well in the final month of the second quarter.!function(){""use strict"";window.addEventListener(""message"",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[""datawrapper-height""])for(var e in a.data[""datawrapper-height""]){var t=document.getElementById(""datawrapper-chart-""+e)||document.querySelector(""iframe[src*='""+e+""']"");t&&(t.style.height=a.data[""datawrapper-height""][e]+""px"")}})}(); BTC created a “bearish outside day” candle on Thursday, which occurs when the day begins on a positive note but ends with pessimism.That candlestick pattern is widely considered an early sign of bullish-to-bearish trend change, especially when it appears after a prolonged rally.Traders usually wait for a strong follow through – preferably a UTC close below the bearish candle’s low – before adopting a bearish bias.The focus, therefore, is on $8,000 (Thursday’s low). Acceptance below that level will likely invite stronger selling pressure, leading to a deeper drop, possibly to the historically strong support of the 30-day moving average, currently at $7,342.With the relative strength index (RSI) reporting bearish divergence – lower highs as opposed to higher highs on price – and volumes rising sharply, a break below $8,000 looks likely.While the odds are stacked in favor of a deeper correction, the cryptocurrency could still manage to eke out gains in June for the fifth straight month if the 30-day MA reverses the pullback.The cryptocurrency has charted higher lows along the 30-day MA throughout the rally from $3,500 to $9,000.Also, the case for a drop to the 30-day MA at $7,342 would weaken if the support at $8,000 holds ground over the weekend.

On that day, BTC had tumbled by $2,171 from the opening price of $11,393 only to recovery all the way back to $11,191 by UTC close.Bitcoin has recovered more than 50 percent since the low hit earlier today. However, just before press time, its price is still down around 8.2 percent on the day at $7,223.The sell-off seen today doesn’t come as much of a surprise, as the widely followed relative strength index (RSI) has been reporting extremely overbought conditions with a near-90 reading earlier this week.Buyer exhaustion was also evident from BTC’s repeated failure to hold onto 10-month highs above $8,300, as seen in the last 72 hours.What’s more, many in the investor community had associated BTC’s recent rise with Blockchain Week NYC and Consensus 2019. The cryptocurrency, therefore, was perhaps vulnerable to “sell the fact” pullback.A massive unwinding of long BTC/USD positions (profit taking) was seen in the 120 minutes to 04:00 UTC, according to data tweeted by bot powered twitter handle @WhaleCalls.

That resulted in a slide to today’s low of $6,178.The move amounts to short-term bearish reversal, as per technical theory. So, the pullback may not be over yet and we could revisit lows seen today over the weekend.That said, investors should watch out for a bounce from the 30-day MA, as that would imply an end of the correction.

Bulls usually take a breather following such stellar rallies. As a result, a sudden correction cannot be ruled out.Any pullbacks, however, will likely be transient, as more long-term technical studies have flipped in favor of the bulls. Further, the narrative that Facebook’s fiat and bond-backed cryptocurrency Libra will end up boosting bitcoin’s appeal is becoming entrenched within the investor community.Joe Kernen, one of the hosts of CNBC’s Squawk Box, is the latest to join the bandwagon of observers calling Facebook’s Libra a net positive for bitcoin.As can be seen above left, the Chaikin money flow index is trending north and is currently at the highest level since the beginning of April. The indicator turned positive in March, signaling a bearish-to-bullish trend change.The relative strength index (above right) is reporting overbought conditions with an above-70 print, but is still well below the high of 86.00 seen in mid-May. Further, the overbought readings on the RSI would gain credence only if the price shows sign of bullish exhaustion, as discussed yesterday.As of now, the bulls are showing few signs of slowing down.The ascending channel breakout seen on the 4-hour chart indicates a continuation of the rally. The RSI has breached the falling trendline, invalidating the bearish lower highs (bearish divergence) pattern.The breakout is also backed by a surge in buy volume, as represented by the green bar (marked by arrow).Therefore, the path of least resistance is to the higher side and prices could rise to resistances at $11,688 (March 2018 high) and $11,780 (February 2018 high).Watch out for a repeated failure at $11,394 – 50 percent Fibonacci retracement of the bear market drop – as that could yield a pullback to the hourly chart support of $10,550.Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency at the time of writingBitcoin image via CoinDesk archives; charts by TradingView"

According to Binance, stolen funds constituted approximately 2 percent of total BTC holdings of the exchange. In order to prevent user’s funds from being affected and guarantee stable work of the platform, Binance used its SAFU fund to cover the loses. The Secure Asset Fund for Users was established on July 14, 2018 and consists of 10 percent of all trading fees.According to Coinfirm, the hackers then moved 1,060.64474480 BTC or $6,148,122.40 in a number of hops, shedding value each time.

During the same time frame, its dominance rate dropped from 45 to 35 percent. That divergence did not bode well for the price, which ended up falling to $5,800 by the end of June.  Other corrective rallies seen in 2018 also lacked support from the dominance rate.A flow toward bitcoin is usually seen at the start of the bull run, as seen in the chart above. For instance, the dominance rate rose from 38 percent to 66.5 percent in the second half of 2017 when prices went from $1,700 to $20,000.As a result, the recent rise in the dominance rate could be considered a confirmation of a new bull market. A number of technical studies have also echoed similar sentiments over the last few weeks.BTC, therefore, could extend the rally toward $6,544 (Nov. 7 high), although a temporary pullback cannot be ruled out if the immediate resistance band of $6,055–$6,100 proves a tough nut to crack in the next day or two.The above chart shows, BTC closed above the June 2018 low of $5,780 on Wednesday, invalidating the bearish candle created on a preceding day and establishing another bullish higher high above $6,000.As of writing, however, the cryptocurrency is struggling to beat the resistance band of $6,055–$6,100. The cryptocurrency had clocked multiple daily lows in that range in September and October 2018. A break higher would further strengthen the bullish case, opening doors to $6,500.Repeated failure at that resistance zone would validate an overbought reading on the relative strength index and allow a pullback to the ascending 10-day moving average (MA), currently at $5,633.The bullish case would further weaken if prices find acceptance below the 30-day MA, currently at $5,365. However, the average has consistently reversed pullbacks since March and may hold ground again, given the long duration charts are biased bullish.Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.Bitcoin image via Shutterstock; charts by Trading View"

Further, BTC remained on the defensive Tuesday, with prices clocking daily highs and lows within Monday’s trading range.Essentially, BTC’s narrowing price range has created a contracting triangle over the last 24 hours, neutralizing the immediate bullish view put forward by Sunday’s rally.The case for notable price pullback, suggested by repeated bull failures at $8,300 would strengthen if the indecision represented by the contracting triangle ends with a downside break.As of writing, the lower edge of the trading range is seen at $7,805, while bitcoin is trading at $7,824, down 1.6 percent on the day.While the short-term prospects are looking a little bleak, the long-term outlook remains constructive, with cryptocurrency reporting nearly 50 percent gains on the opening price of $5,267 seen May 1. Further, BTC is trading well above the 200-day MA, currently at $4,485.A 4-hour close below $7,805 would confirm a triangle breakdown and open the door for a drop to $7,200.Supporting the bearish case is the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) histogram, which has turned negative.Further, the Chaikin money flow index is losing altitude, indicating weakening of buying pressure.With prices trading well below $8,200, the bearish hammer (or hanging man) candle created on Monday is still valid. That candlestick is widely considered an early warning of a bullish-to-bearish trend change, as discussed yesterday.Add to that, the three rejections at $8,300 seen in the last eight days, as well as the multiple failures to hold onto gains above $8,000, and the cryptocurrency appears overdue for a correction.As a result, the narrowing price range looks likely to be breached to the downside.As mentioned, a range breakdown would open the doors to $7,200. A UTC close below that level would expose the historically strong support of the 30-day moving average (MA), currently at $6,413.Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.Bitcoin image via Shutterstock; technical charts by Trading View"

The views expressed here are his own.","With the announcement of Libra, cryptocurrency has entered the big leagues.Facebook’s entry into this market means every single company now has to take cryptocurrency seriously. Companies around the world are now considering their cryptocurrency strategy.This is not a repeat of the corporate circle-jerks of 2015 and 2017. Then, companies played with the idea of having a “blockchain” strategy. Blockchain was a buzzword and companies indulged their innovation departments in building toys that never saw the light of day as actual products. This time could not be more different. Facebook has hammered the final nail in the coffin of “blockchain not bitcoin.”Facebook has taken blockchain seriously. They understand that “the technology” isn’t cool. What’s cool are the unprecedented products that technology can be used to create: digital cash, new currencies and programmatic money. Every business ever has sought to make money.Now, one of the biggest businesses in the world, has decided to dispense with the middle steps and go straight to the making money part.“Why, the crypto pundits have been asking, ‘Do they need a blockchain for this?’” Libra, after all, will be permissioned. They could have “just used a database.”The answer is simple. Even Facebook could not create this product without the (albeit limited) decentralization that blockchain affords. Facebook needs blockchain for this for the same reason any cryptocurrency needs blockchain. The only central actors that are allowed to issue money are regulated financial institutions. They need to be regulated anywhere that money is issued and used. That is hundreds of different jurisdictions with thousands of different regulations.Blockchains are protocols that create money and transact money in the form of cryptographic proofs. They are unregulated for the same reason peer-to-peer encryption is unregulated: They are too abstract. The combination of decentralized governance and value that results from solving mathematical problems means that regulators even define laws that would be limited enough in scope to make sense and broad enough to be effective.They have tried to regulate cryptography and encryption many times and always failed.Up until now that was a curious fact that polite society had agreed to mostly ignore, sometimes with a derisive chuckle. From now on, it is a fact of business that serious-minded executives need to master.Master it they will, and Facebook has laid out the playbook:Do these things and you a whole world of profiting from seigniorage opens before you. Build loyalty that goes beyond just brand and product to the very means of paying for those products. Collect data previously unheard of, and attribute purchasing behavior to marketing in ways never before possible. Tax every transaction or the interest earned on funds held as reserves. And if you play your cards right, maybe even create money out of thin air.The big leagues attract the big players. Banks, technology companies, giant retailers, telcos, now have no choice but to enter this game.The world will not sit idly by and let Facebook own this new, phenomenal market opportunity. A thousand stablecoins are coming. Starbucks will let you buy your venti with “Starbucks.” Verizon and AT&T will issue money as mobile and smart as the device already in your pocket.Juul will give you discounts if you pay in Jems. The city of Venice will make tourists pay for the burden they have become in, what else, Ducats.Sure, many of these products will have the same fate as Pets.com. Most products fail. So what? Money is a product now, and if there is one thing every business wants to do, it’s make money.Bell via Shutterstock"

After all, prices have found acceptance below the crucial 30-day price average. Further, key technical indicators are flashing signs of bullish exhaustion.Even so, it is still too early to call a bearish reversal as BTC is yet to confirm the most basic of all bearish chart patterns, a paired lower high and lower low.A lower high has been established, though, with the bounce from the June 4 low of $7,432 topping out at $8,135 on June 7.Therefore, the immediate outlook is neutral and a bearish reversal would only be confirmed if BTC drops below $7,432 to print that lower low.With the price currently trading at $7,730, the short-term bullish-to-bearish trend change is less than $300 away.The lower high created by BTC’s shallow bounce from the June 4 low of $7,432 looks to be the right shoulder of a head-and-shoulders bearish reversal pattern.A UTC close below $7,432 would activate twin bearish cues: a lower high/lower low and a head-and-shoulders (H&S) breakdown.The H&S breakdown, if confirmed, would create room for a drop to $5,800 (target as per the measured move method). On the way lower, BTC may find support at the 50-day MA, currently at $7,000.With the relative strength index (RSI) reporting a bearish divergence, a close below $7,432 looks likely.BTC fell 12.6 percent last week and closed Sunday (UTC time) well below $8,000, validating the bullish exhaustion signaled by the previous week’s doji candle.Essentially, the doji candle and the bearish follow-through indicate the period of indecision or exhaustion in the market place has ended with the bears victorious.The risks, therefore, are skewed to the downside.Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.Bitcoin image via CoinDesk archives; charts by Trading View"

Shipment of the first batch won’t be scheduled until August, according to the firm’s website.Even more expensive and powerful products, such as the WhatsMiner M20, launched by ex-Bitmain chip design director Zuoxing Yang, are seeing an increasing level of buying interest. Yang told CoinDesk that the next batch of M20s, which are scheduled for shipment as late as October, is “almost sold out” at the moment. But Yang added another important reason why the industry’s supply is having difficulty catching up with the demand is production capacity due to the limited supply of chips from various vendors to begin with.“Bitcoin’s hash rate increase just can’t keep up with the pace of the price jump,” Yang said. “Production capacity is the bottleneck.”Indeed, the resurgence of mining interest is also reflected in the overall amount of computing power devoted to securing the bitcoin network, which recently hit an all-time high.Based on data from mining pool BTC.com, the latest one day and seven-day average hash rates are at 65 million TH/s and 58 million TH/s, respectively. This aggregated computing power has jumped by about 80 percent since late last year when the 14-day average bitcoin mining hash rate dropped to as low as 36 million TH/s amid bitcoin’s price decline.Assuming all such additional computing power has come from more widely used mining models like the AntMiner S9 or Avalon 851 with an average hashing power of about 14 TH/s, that would translate to roughly 2 million mining units having been switched on over the past few months.As a result, BTC.com estimates that bitcoin mining difficulty – a measure of how hard it is to solve the math problems that earn new coins – will further increase by six percent at the beginning of the next adjustment cycle to an all-time-high level above 7.8 trillion.Bitcoin ASIC miner image via Shutterstock"

Similarly, the rise to $9,366 seen in the U.S. trading hours on June 17 was short-lived with prices falling back to $9,000.While bitcoin bulls seem to be having a breather, the open bets in CME futures have hit record highs for two consecutive days.The open interest – the number of contracts or commitments outstanding in futures at a given point of time – jumped to a record high of 5,311 contracts or $250 million on June 17 and hit a new lifetime of 5,391 on the following day.It is worth noting that open bets have continued to rise along with the price this year and are currently up almost 80 percent from the levels seen in June 2018.A rise in open interest along with the rise in price mostly indicates long (buy) positions are being built up. As a result, bitcoin’s recent rally looks sustainable – more so, as the CME has associated record open bets with an increased institutional interest in the leading cryptocurrency.Further, JPMorgan Chase recently pointed to the difference between trading volumes on cryptocurrency exchanges and CME as a sign of increased institutional activity in bitcoin.Therefore, the cryptocurrency looks set to test $10,000 and may possibly break higher, as suggested by long-term technical charts below.The falling channel breakout confirmed in April indicates the path of least resistance is to the higher side. It is worth noting that a similar bearish channel breakout in October 2015 was followed by a 2.3-year bull run.Also supporting the case for a rise to $10,000 and above is the bullish crossover of the 5- and 10-day moving averages.
The long-term bullish outlook would be invalidated if the price finds acceptance below May’s low of $5,350, although that looks unlikely.That said, the rise to $10,000 could be preceded by a temporary price pullback.The above chart shows sell volumes (red bars) have been bigger than buy volumes (green bars) over the last four days on major exchanges included in the calculation of Bitwise’s “real” bitcoin trading volume.As a result, the price may fall back below the support at $9,000. That would expose the ascending trendline, currently located at $8,690.The case for a pullback would weaken if the price finds acceptance above $9,300 on the back of high volumes.Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency at the time of writingBitcoin image via CoinDesk archives; charts by TradingView"

However, the rise was short-lived as expected, with prices falling back to $7,740 within the last hour. As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $7,840, representing a 2 percent drop on a 24-hour basis.Essentially, the cryptocurrency has failed twice in the last 48 hours to keep gains above $8,300, which validates the extreme overbought conditions reported by the widely followed relative strength index (RSI).While the pullback from highs above $8,300 on May 14 was reversed by the 50-hour moving average (MA) support, the latest fall has taken prices below that line. As a result, a deeper correction is looking increasingly likely.BTC has dived out the bullish channel and could end up forming a double-top bearish reversal pattern with the neckline support at $7,619.A slide to that key support looks likely, as the RSI printed another lower high earlier today, contradicting BTC’s rise to fresh 10-month highs, and is now reporting a descending triangle breakdown.A 4-hour close below $7,619 would confirm a double-top breakdown and create room for a drop to levels below $6,900 (target as per the measured move method).The RSI on the daily chart is also beginning to diverge from the uptrend in price, signaling weakening bullish momentum.The 10-day MA, currently at $7,036, is still trending north, indicating a bullish setup. As a result, pullbacks to $7,000, if any, could be short-lived.The short-term outlook would turn bearish if and when prices find acceptance below the historically strong support of the 30-day MA, currently at $5,923.The case for a pullback would weaken if the price rises back above $8,300.

Essentially, BTC created multiple bullish higher lows along that line over the last four months, as discussed yesterday.Now, the short-term outlook has turned bearish with the first UTC close below the average since Feb. 8. Other widely-tracked technical indicators are also signaling a trend change in favor of the bears.The 14-day relative strength index (RSI) has dived out of the rising trendline representing a rally from December lows near $3,100, and is now teasing a drop into a bearish territory with a reading below 50.00. Further, the 5- and 10-day moving averages have produced a bearish crossover.The Chaikin money flow index – which takes into account both the price and trading volumes – is losing altitude, a sign of weakening buying pressure.The price action seen at press time also indicates that the tide has turned, with BTC struggling to register big gains above the 30-day MA, currently at $7,772.That BTC is revisiting the 30-day MA hurdle is not surprising, as markets tend to crowd out weak hands (buyers in this case) before falling on price breakdowns/breakouts.Overall, the cryptocurrency looks set to test the psychological support of $7,000 over the next few days.On the 3-day chart, the RSI has rolled over from overbought levels above 70, signaling scope for deeper correction. The indicator diverged in favor of the bears (lower highs) earlier this week.The Chaikin money flow index is also beginning to lose altitude on this time-frame.Thus, BTC risks falling to the 200-candle MA, currently flatlined at $7,211.The hourly chart tells a slightly different story, reporting a bullish divergence (higher lows) of the RSI. So BTC may extend its recovery to $8,000, before a potential slide toward $7,000, as suggested by the daily and 3-day charts.The short-term bias will remain bearish as long as prices are held below the 10-day MA, currently at $8,383.Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.Bitcoin image via Shutterstock; charts by Trading View"

The average, currently located at $4,544, is beginning to curl upwards in favor of the bulls for the first time in over 12 months.So BTC looks set to end in the green for the fourth straight month, having rallied 11, 8 and 28.6 percent in February, March and April, respectively.

That is the first bullish crossover between the two averages since July 2015.The development further confirms the long-term bearish-to-bullish trend change signaled by several technical indicators, including a golden crossover, over the last few weeks.The moving average studies, however, are lagging indicators and have limited predictive abilities, as they take old price history into account.Even so, investors may take heart as a similar crossover in July 2015 was followed by a 2.5-year bull run.The 100-day MA has crossed the 200-day MA from below (see above left). The latest bullish crossover comes two weeks after the confirmation of a golden crossover of the 50- and 200-day MAs.The last bull cross of the 100- and 200-day MAs (above right), confirmed on July 26, 2015, remained valid for 33 months, during which the price rallied 8,000 percent to a record high of $20,000.With the next mining reward halving due in May 2020, the doors seem open for BTC rise further over the long-term.The short-term outlook is also bullish. The 30-day MA is trending north with the price creating bullish higher highs and higher lows.

As a result, the third largest cryptocurrency could rise further toward $0.50 in the near-term.While major altcoins have found some love, the flow of money is also heading towards lesser-known cryptocurrencies, as seen in the chart below.The surge in altcoins has pushed their total market capitalization to $95.65 billion – a level last seen on Nov. 8, 2018.The lower highs on both the relative strength index (RSI) and the Chaikin money flow (CMF) on the 4-hour chart (above left) indicate that bullish momentum for BTC has weakened.

A trading pair will be created on Binance.com between the pegged token and bitcoin (BTCB/BTC).The crypto-pegged tokens, based on the exchange’s BEP2 format, will be backed by Binance’s reserves of the pegged cryptocurrency. Before the news was announced Monday, CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao tweeted a warning of an impending move of bitcoin for the purpose.There will be a transfer of 9001 BTC soon, no need to FUD. It’s for a good thing, details to follow. Waiting for whale_alert.— CZ Binance (@cz_binance) June 17, 2019
Binance explained in the post:“Large buy orders will be maintained on the trading pair on Binance.com, with a price spread of around 0.1%. This provides an easy way for anyone to convert from the pegged token back into the native coin on Binance.com. If this buy order is filled, a new order will be placed while an equal amount of funds will be deposited from the reserve address into Binance.com. The sum of the buy order and the funds on the published reserve address will be bigger than the total supply of the pegged token, ensuring there is always 100% backing.”The Binance team reasoned that the increase in the selection of tokens available on Binance DEX will increase trading volume and liquidity, thereby furthering the utility and value of the platform. Also noteworthy is that Binance is eschewing the option to use to cross-chain atomic swaps or other decentralized approaches to enable exchanges of non-native tokens on the DEX.The company said:“While this approach is more centralized than atomic swaps, we believe it provides a higher degree of ease-of-use to most traders. And most traders are already trusting Binance.com to hold their funds anyway.”In the post, the firm said that the new tokens are “proposed” for launch on Binance DEX currently.Additionally, because the reserve addresses will be published on the blockchain, Binance said the new crypto-pegged tokens will be easier to audit than traditional bank reserves.The company is encouraging clients to issue pegged tokens of their own coins on the Binance Chain, offering (though not guaranteeing) to facilitate a pegged/native pair.Earlier this month, Binance also confirmed to Bloomberg that it would soon launch stablecoins on its chain too.Chief financial officer, Wei Zhou, said the first stablecoin offering, to be linked to the British pound, will be live on the platform “in a matter of weeks to a month or two.”Changpeng Zhao image courtesy of Binance"

A similar rejection at that average had ended up killing the nascent bull market four years ago, as discussed on Friday.Further, with the pullback from five-month highs above $5,600 to $5,000 witnessed last week, the widely-followed 14-day relative strength index (RSI) is flashing bearish.So, the path of least resistance appears to be on the downside in the short-term.That said, investors looking to buy at lower levels may be left disappointed if the 30-day moving average (MA), which consistently applied brakes on price pullbacks in March, again fuels a strong bounce.That possibility cannot be ruled out, as the longer duration charts are still looking bullish. For instance, BTC is currently sitting well above the widely tracked barometer of a long-term trend, the 200-day MA, currently at $4,438. Other long-term indicators like the 14-week RSI are also reporting bullish conditions.As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $5,163 on Bitstamp, representing little change on a 24-hour basis, while the 30-day MA is located at $5,107.While the 30-day MA had served as strong resistance in January, on Feb. 8, BTC confirmed seller exhaustion by establishing a bullish higher low and closing well above the 30-day MA after a 7.8 percent rise.The newfound support has reversed price pullbacks ever since. The chart reveals BTC has established bullish higher lows along the 30-day MA throughout the recent rally, from lows near $3,300 to highs above $5,600.Further, the long-term bullish breakout witnessed on April 2 was preceded by a higher low formation on the 30-day MA on March 26.Hence, a bounce from that average would abort the short-term bearish view and could yield re-test of $5,627 (April 23 high).A UTC close lower would imply an end of the rally from the Feb. 8 lows near $3,300 and allow for a deeper drop, possibly to the 50-day MA, currently at $4,649. That’s supported by the short-term bearish technical setup, as represented by the lower highs on the RSI, the bearish crossover of the 5- and 10-day MAs and the downside break of the channel.BTC has created a red candle with long wicks (the gap between weekly high and opening price and weekly low and closing price) and small body (spread between open and close) on the weekly chart. The candle is widely considered a sign of indecision in the market.The candle, however, appeared following a rally from lows near $3,300 seen in February and at the crucial 50-week MA resistance. So, it could indicate, more specifically, indecision among the buyers.Any break below the 30-day MA would validate the bullish exhaustion signaled by the weekly candle and open the doors to deeper price pullback.The long-term outlook will remain bullish as long as the price is holding above the former resistance-turned-support of $4,236 (Dec. 24 high).Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.Bitcoin image via Shutterstock; charts by Trading View"

Prices rallied 54 percent in November 2017 on speculation that the launch of BTC futures on major U.S. derivative exchanges would open the doors to institutional money in the crypto space.So, as long as prices close May above $7,350, the monthly gain would be the highest since November 2017.With long-term technical studies biased bullish, the cryptocurrency looks set to post its best monthly gain since August 2017.The recent rally, however, is looking overstretched on the short-term charts. So, a price pullback and a monthly close below $7,347 cannot be ruled out.As can be seen (above left), the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) is reporting overbought conditions with an above-80 reading. The RSIs on both the weekly and 3-day charts (above right) are also flashing similar signals.As a result, the cryptocurrency may have a tough time scaling the immediate resistance at $8,500 (July 2018 high) in the short-term.It is worth noting that many in the investor community, including Fundstrat’s Tom Lee, have associated the recent rally with the Consensus 2019 conference in New York, which kicked off on Monday. BTC, therefore, could witness a “sell the fact” pullback following the conclusion of Blockchain Week.As for the next 24 hours, the cryptocurrency could fall back to lows near $7,450, according to the hourly chart below.BTC has created a bearish engulfing candle and the RSI has created lower highs as opposed to higher highs on the price.That bearish divergence indicates that bullish momentum has weakened and a price pullback could be in the offing, possibly to the 50-hour moving average (MA), currently located at $7,448.The bearish divergence, however, would be invalidated if the price rises above $8,335. In that case, the cryptocurrency will likely challenge $8,500.Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.Bitcoin and calendar image via Shutterstock; technical charts by Trading View"

That is the longest monthly winning streak and the biggest monthly gain since August 2017.Notably, the leading cryptocurrency by market value has put on a good show despite the losses on Wall Street. The S&P 500 index – a benchmark for global equity markets – is on track to end May with a 6 percent loss.Other riskier assets – the ones which are sensitive to economic growth prospects – are also flashing monthly losses, as seen below.!function(){""use strict"";window.addEventListener(""message"",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[""datawrapper-height""])for(var e in a.data[""datawrapper-height""]){var t=document.getElementById(""datawrapper-chart-""+e)||document.querySelector(""iframe[src*='""+e+""']"");t&&(t.style.height=a.data[""datawrapper-height""][e]+""px"")}})}();Both copper and brent oil, the barometers of global economic activity, have dropped 9 percent and 11 percent, respectively this month. The Chinese Yuan has also shed 2 percent.Investors have clearly sold risk in May, possibly due to the re-escalation of the US-China trade war and the resulting fears of a global economic recession.The flight to safety has boded well for traditional safe haven assets. For instance, gold is reporting a 1 percent monthly gain and the US 10-year treasury yield is down 13 percent or 43 basis points (bond prices and yields move in opposite directions).The gains in the traditional safe havens, however, appear lackluster when compared to bitcoin’s 60 percent rise. That said, it is still too early to conclude that BTC is the new safe haven.This is due to the fact that up until now, BTC has moved mostly in line with the risk assets, as seen in the above chart. For instance, BTC is up 127 percent on a year-to-date basis. The S&P 500 and other major risk assets are also reporting year-to-date gains.Also, BTC largely mimicked the price action in the equity markets in 2018.BTC’s reputation as digital gold will be solidified if it continues to post solid gains during bouts of risk aversion, if any, in the coming months.Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.Bitcoin & bull image via Shutterstock; Graph data via Trading View"

bitcoin ...","May 13, 2019 at 13:00 UTC",Microsoft is launching the first decentralized infrastructure implementation by a major tech company that is built directly on the bitcoin blockchain.,"The open source project, called Ion, deals with the underlying mechanics of how networks talk to each other. For example, if you log onto Airbnb using Facebook, a protocol deals with the software that sends the personal information from your social profile to that external service provider. In this case, Ion handles the decentralized identifiers, which control the ability to prove you own the keys to this data.Christopher Allen, a crypto veteran and the co-founder of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) working group for decentralized identity (DID) solutions, told CoinDesk that Microsoft’s move could impact the entire tech industry.“A lot of enterprise infrastructures use Microsoft products,” Allen said. “So if they integrate this into any of their infrastructure products, they’ll have access to DID.”Indeed, Yorke Rhodes, a program manager on Microsoft’s blockchain engineering team, told CoinDesk that Microsoft’s team has been working for a year on a key signing and validation software that relies on public networks, like bitcoin or ethereum, yet can handle far greater throughput than the underlying blockchain itself.Underscoring the fact that Microsoft was a founding member of the Decentralized Identity Foundation, Rhodes said:“There are systems that we have at Microsoft that give you permissions in an enterprise context, a product called Active Directory, that we think need to be able to recognize these DIDs as well.”He added such infrastructure products and services related to Azure are among the Microsoft’s most popular offerings. This tiny piece in a giant machine, then, could have far-reaching impacts.Meanwhile, an anonymous source with knowledge of Microsoft’s project told CoinDesk that Ion will shift from using bitcoin’s testnet to the bitcoin mainnet later this year. As such, any tech-savvy observer could run a node and contribute to this project.Said W3C’s Allen:“To have Microsoft say they are not scared of bitcoin, and in fact, it has some very good properties and we are willing to take advantage of those properties, is, I think, a step in the right direction.”Stepping back, the difference between a DID under the hood, versus current infrastructure, speaks to the heart of users owning their own content and access. In the example of Facebook and Airbnb, with a DID, Facebook might be able to shut down your social media account but could not revoke access to all the tools that relied on the Facebook ID to log in. Plus, all those personal photos on Facebook would belong to the user, the holder of the DID.Yet Facebook, in particular, may not align with Microsoft’s approach.Another anonymous source told CoinDesk that although Facebook has been invited to participate in Microsoft’s DID projects and community efforts, so far the social media company has declined and instead continued to follow its historic approach to user data.“They’re going in a different direction that’s not as decentralized,” the source said of Facebook.The Wall Street Journal and others have reported that Facebook is looking to build a stablecoin-based payments platform for the social network. Yet Allen said he hasn’t seen any effort from Facebook to support DID standards or community efforts such as W3C, which may create a rift with corporations like Microsoft that are making such standards a core pillar of their business model.Rouven Heck, head of DID at ConsenSys and active member of the W3C, told CoinDesk that Facebook is noticeably absent from community discussions across the tech industry about DIDs.And although Rhodes said he was not aware of any dealings with Facebook, there was clearly a misalignment between the two company’s goals for using blockchain technology.“Facebook is the complete antithesis of consumer privacy,” he said. “Their business model is based on the fact they can monetize data about you.”What’s more, U.S. Senate Banking Committee last week wrote a letter to Facebook that voiced concerns about how the social media company will handle financial data with its crypto project, which is codenamed Libra. Few details about Libra have been shared to date outside of press reports.In the past, Allen said that Facebook only implemented parts of protocols that enabled data sharing “in a proprietary way that only benefited” Facebook.With regards to what approach the social media giant will take to blockchain systems, a Facebook spokesperson told CoinDesk:“Like many other companies, Facebook is exploring ways to leverage the power of blockchain technology. This new small team is exploring many different applications. We don’t have anything further to share.”In contrast to the allegations that Facebook is taking a different direction with its project, both ConsenSys and Microsoft are opting to make open source initiatives core pillars of their respective business models.“If we can create certain standards it will help the system to build up faster, and that’s good for all of us,” Heck said. “The different products we have are all useful across the space and not built into some proprietary niche.”Rhodes agrees with this approach, saying that engaging with the open source ecosystem serves Microsoft’s business objectives. He said the “philosophy of consumer ownership and consumer centricity” are core principles for designing Microsoft’s software going forward.Allen said he hopes a sense of public responsibility will continue to be viewed as a competitive advantage – especially as Microsoft Azure goes head-to-head with Amazon Web Services for cloud market share.“You could have a service that is in the cloud hosted by Microsoft Azure, but is absolutely secure because everything in it is encrypted with your keys that you control and everything that run under your authority, even though it’s in the cloud,” Allen said.In Rhodes’ opinion, current experiments with blockchain technology are comparable to Microsoft releasing Windows 95 in decades past, which helped boost mainstream internet usage through a consumer-oriented operating system.“Networking stacks were very tied to logins to existing networks,” Rhodes said of the pre-Windows 95 internet. “Like that, I think [Ion] is pretty significant.”Microsoft image via Shutterstock"

Back then, the price had advanced for seven successive days – from July 13 to July 19 – to hit highs above $7,500, as per data source CoinMarketCap.The latest six-day winning streak saw bitcoin rise from $8,120 to $9,366, possibly due to the hype surrounding Facebook’s foray into cryptocurrencies, Binance.com’s decision to ban US customers and other factors, as discussed on Monday.On Tuesday, the social media giant officially launched its cryptocurrency Libra to mixed reviews with many experts calling it a net positive development for bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general.Even so, BTC suffered moderate losses, possibly because Facebook’s Libra launch was priced in over the weekend.Looking forward, the long-term outlook remains bullish with technical charts calling a rise to $10,000. However, in the next 24 hours, a correction to key support near $8,700 could be seen.As of writing, BTC is trading largely unchanged on the day at $9,135, according to CoinMarketCap.BTC’s previous three-day candle closed above the high of $9,006 hit on May 30, establishing another bullish higher high. It is worth noting that the cryptocurrency has charted a series of higher lows and higher highs since early February.Further, the 5- and 10-candle moving averages (MAs) continue to trend north, indicating a bullish setup and the widely followed relative strength index (RSI) has maintained the bullish bias with a bounce from the ascending trendline connecting November and January lows.Therefore, the path of least resistance is on the higher side. On the way toward $10,000, BTC may face stiff resistance at $9,642 – 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of the sell-off from $20,078 to $3,193.The bullish bias would be invalidated if the price finds acceptance below the ascending 10-candle MA, currently at $8,477.The outlook would turn bearish if the price drops below recent lows below $7,600, violating the bullish higher lows pattern.The RSI has produced lower highs on the 4-hour chart over the last five days, contradicting the higher highs on price. That bearish divergence indicates scope for a price pullback.The bearish RSI divergence would be invalidated if the indicator cuts through the descending trendline hurdle, currently at 60.As seen above, the price is stuck between the 50-hour and 100-hour MAs.The cryptocurrency bounced up from the 100-hour MA in Asian trading hours. So far, however, the 50-hour MA hurdle, currently at $9,198, has proved a tough nut to crack.A break below the overnight low of $9,005 would confirm bearish lower highs and lower lows pattern and allow a deeper drop to $8,600 – support of the trendline connecting June 10 and June 11 lows.Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency at the time of writingBitcoin image via Shutterstock; charts by TradingView"

The process is repeated every four years and tends to put a strong bid under the cryptocurrency almost 1.5 years in advance, according to historical data.For instance, bitcoin created a long-term bottom 18 months ahead of the reward halving in July 2016 and rallied 178 percent 12 months leading up to the event.With history possibly looking to repeat itself, the path of least resistance is to the higher side. In the short-run, however, the price may pullback to establish a higher low (new base) before rallying further.Bitcoin fell close to 4 percent on Sunday, leaving a red candle with a long upper shadow in its wake – one widely considered a sign of bullish exhaustion.So far, however, the follow-through to that candle has been anything but bearish with the cryptocurrency finding takers near $6,860 earlier today and moving back above $7,000.Further, the moving average studies continue to favor upside in prices. For instance, the 5- and 10-day moving averages (MAs), currently at $6,759 and $6,265, are trending north. The stacking order of the 50-day MA, above the 100-day MA, above the 200-day MA, is a classic bullish indicator.A retest of highs above $7,500 could soon be seen if the contracting triangle seen on the hourly chart (above right) is breached to the higher side.However, both the overbought readings on the 14-day relative strength and Sunday’s candle representing bullish exhaustion would gain credence if BTC finds acceptance below $6,762 (yesterday’s low) in the next 48 hours or so.That could yield a deeper pullback toward the psychological support of $6,000. The probability of a drop to $6,762 would rise if the contracting triangle ends with a downside break.Bitcoin ended last week with 22 percent gains – the third biggest weekly gain since December (marked by numbers above). Further, the cryptocurrency closed above the 100-week MA, which may now offer support at $6,562.Pullbacks to $6,000, if any, following a potential close daily close (UTC) below $6,762, could be short-lived, as the bullish (ascending) 5-week MA is currently located just below $6,050.Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.Bitcoin image via Shutterstock; charts by Trading View"

With that information, the fund sends him a small portion of his year-long bitcoin salary.A fresh batch of donations means the fund is now open to applications from more developers. While many contributors have donated anonymously to the fund, known benefactors including entrepreneur Kevin Pan of Poolin and others from China’s crypto ecosystem.“We collected 50 bitcoin,” Wan told CoinDesk. “Right now, you wouldn’t believe it, there are less than 10 full-time bitcoin developers. …We want to fund full-time independent bitcoin developers.”To be fair, it’s hard to say how many people work full time on Bitcoin Core if you include independent research and open source, nonprofit projects like crypto wallets. Several organizations already support open source development, such as Chaincode Labs, Blockstream, MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative, and Square. In the future, Dovey said, she expects companies like Microsoft to support independent developers.Yet while Woosley expressed ample respect for the above-mentioned companies, he said this fund is the “most independent” funding model for bitcoin development that he’s seen so far.“We should be wary of forming a bias, of groupthink,” Woosley said. “Having diverse funding models helps protect us against groupthink on any given topic.”The fund has no say over what the developers prioritize, although the cofounders are themselves fascinated by updates that relate to the lightning network and fungibility. Instead, the money is distributed based on evidence of past contributions to Bitcoin Core and continued work on any aspect of the project the developer chooses.Prospective applicants can now send their biography information and GitHub profile to Wan’s Primitive Ventures email.Pan, who helps manage the fund’s daily operations, told CoinDesk:“We are looking for someone who’s got a deep understanding of Bitcoin’s architecture and its existing problems to solve…if he or she can train, coach, or facilitate other developers, propose new BIPs [protocol updates] and new directions for technical improvement, that’s even better.”As one of the donors, Qtum Foundation founder Patrick Dai agreed with Dovey and Woosley about the importance of contributing to open source development.“The Qtum project inherited a lot of great technology from Bitcoin’s development work,” Dai told CoinDesk. “There are so many companies and projects and individuals benefiting a lot from Bitcoin software. The easiest way to say thanks is to give some support to the talented developers behind the bitcoin network.”Image of Dovey Wan at Consensus 2019 via Brady Dale, CoinDesk"

Over that period, the cryptocurrency rose 230 percent, propelling prices to a lifetime high of $20,000 in December.With the 165 percent price rise, BTC seems to have left the bear market far behind. In fact, the bearish-to-bullish trend change was confirmed on April 2, when prices rallied $1,000 to levels above $5,000.The cryptocurrency then rose above $8,000 in the run-up to New York Blockchain Week held from May 10 to May 18 and remained bid after the event to hit highs near $9,100 on May 30.The two-month double-digit winning streak has now extended into June, with prices briefly hitting 15-month highs above $11,000 over the weekend. The recent leg higher from $7,500 to $10,000 could be associated with Facebook’s foray into cryptocurrencies.Observers believe that Facebook’s Libra project will not only boost the adoption of cryptocurrencies, but will also strengthen bitcoin’s appeal as an anti-establishment asset.Further, the leading cryptocurrency by market value is set to undergo a mining reward halving in May next year. Therefore, the long-term price prospects look bright.In the short run, however, a repeated failure to hold onto gains above $11,000 could yield a correction. As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $10,880, representing 2.4 percent gains on the day.The RSIs on the weekly, 3-day and daily charts are reporting overbought conditions with above-70 readings.So far, however, prices aren’t showing any signs of bullish exhaustion. The bullish structure of higher lows and higher highs is intact and the 5-and 10-candle moving averages (MA) on all three charts continue to trend north.The overbought readings on the RSIs would gain credence only if signs of bull exhaustion emerge in the form of candlestick patterns such as doji, bearish engulfing, hanging man, etc.The bullish outlook would be invalidated only if and when prices drop below $9,097 (May 30 high), invalidating the bullish higher lows and higher highs pattern.On the higher side, resistance is seen at $11,247 (Sunday’s high) and $11,394 (50 percent Fibonacci retracement of the bear market drop).BTC has failed twice over the weekend to hold onto gains above $10,000 with the RSI charting lower highs (bearish divergence).That RSI pattern would gain credence if the cryptocurrency again fades a break above $10,000, leading to a drop toward $10,000 – the support of the ascending trendline.BTC was expected to put on a good show in the three months to June 30 this year, as a number of technical indicators had turned bullish in February and March.Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency at the time of writingBitcoin image via CoinDesk archives; charts by TradingView"

Indeed, the broader market is flashing green today with nine of the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap rank reporting gains above two percent, the strongest performer of which, Cardano (ADA), is now up 9.71 percent on the day, CoinDesk data shows. In all, the total capitalization of the cryptocurrency market increased roughly 6.3 billion during today’s rally and now stands at $184.3 million, down roughly 78.2 percent from it’s all-time high of $835 billion achieved on January 7, 2018.

","At 21:30 UTC today, the price world’s largest cryptocurrency rose as high as $8,195 on Coinbase, marking a 17.4 percent or $1214 increase during today’s trading session.In the past 24 hours alone, Messari data reveals more than $27 billion worth of bitcoin was traded across exchanges, whereas $2,1 billion was traded solely on the 10 exchanges Bitwise Asset Management identified as the only exchanges reporting honest volume figures. While vigorous, today’s development is not an anomaly. In fact, bitcoin’s price increases have been aggressive for much of 2019 and rose more than $1000 dollars once again just two days ago.In the past 90-days alone the cryptocurrency has increased 127 percent in price, nearly 60 percent of which was accrued in the last 30 days alone, Messari data reveals.The USD value of most cryptocurrencies are seeing notable increases as a result of bitcoin’s rebound, including the likes of Binance Coin (BNB) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) both of whom are reporting double-digit 24-hour gains.That said, bitcoin’s percent share of the capitalization of the total cryptocurrency market is now a 60 percent – its highest since Dec. 11, 2017 according to Coinmarketcap, and a sign its growth is outpacing the rest of the broader market. Interestingly, a very similar and parabola shaped price increase like the one bitcoin has just witnessed occurred at the end of the previous bear market in 2015.As can be seen below, bitcoin’s price trend entered a parabolic rise after reaching a low of $198 on Aug. 25, 2015 followed by a  near 150 percent increase before temporarily topping out at $499 on Nov. 4th of that year.Is #bitcoin repeating history again?The current parabolic rise looks very similar to how the previous bear market in 2014-15 ended. $BTC/USD increased roughly 150% from previous lows on both occasions. pic.twitter.com/LQa8iBnR4S— CoinDesk Markets (@CoinDeskMarkets) May 13, 2019Indeed, history seems to be repeating itself, or at least rhyming, as bitcoin’s market has once again entered a parabolic structure having increased nearly 150 percent from its most recent low of $3,128 set on Dec. 15, 2018.Disclosure: The author holds several cryptocurrencies.

brought together 100 people to collectively execute a “CoinJoin” ...","Jun 10, 2019 at 19:00 UTC",The community behind the privacy-centric bitcoin app Wasabi Wallet recently brought together 100 people to collectively execute a “CoinJoin” transaction on bitcoin in what might be the biggest event of its kind.,"Some context: bitcoin itself is far from private, as users can, via the blockchain, see where coins are being transferred to and from. One effort to afford greater privacy to transactions is CoinJoin, a long-standing technology first proposed in 2013 by long-time bitcoin idea man and cryptographer Greg Maxwell. The idea is that transactions can be made more private by jumbling a number of different transactions together and then redistributing them.At 100 transactions, Wasabi Wallet’s effort might be the biggest, but it’s certainly an advancement for the privacy tech as a whole.“There wasn’t any service created to do such large CoinJoins,” zkSNACKS CTO Adam Fiscor told CoinDesk, which launched Wasabi Wallet last year to make CoinJoin transactions easier to use. Fiscor did add one small caveat that it’s “possible” that Blockchain’s SharedCoin has done one as large, “but I’m not sure if it’s relevant.”As Fiscor explained to CoinDesk, the event represented “the largest practical CoinJoin that can be done on the bitcoin network.” That’s because of some of the built-in restrictions on the bitcoin network, such as the limit on the amount of data that can be included in a single transaction block), as well as the human practicalities of getting so many people to transact together at once.“The third caveat is that it’s pretty damn hard to coordinate 100 people over the Tor network,” Fiscor remarked.And indeed, the transaction took a while to execute. Partially on the Wasabi Wallet reddit, the community tried unsuccessfully for a while to organize a 100 person CoinJoin, getting 94, 97, 92, and even 99 participants before reaching their round goal of 100.Going further, Fiscor hopes this large CoinJoin transaction offers a showcase of the norm for bitcoin’s use into the future.In short, the more transactions in a CoinJoin, the more privacy you get, because with more users it becomes harder to untangle all the transactions that initially went in.“However, ‘anonymity loves company’ the more participants there are, the better your privacy is, and the faster the CoinJoin rounds are,” the Wasabi Wallet website explains.Getting 100 people to join together for a transaction might seem like overkill, but Fiscor sees it as the future because the more transactions in one, the more efficient it is, too.“In the long term bitcoin mixing will be either priced out from the blockchain or improve to be as cost efficient as possible. The more participants there are, the more cost efficiency can be gained,” Fiscor said.And that’s especially the case with upcoming technologies that could  be added to bitcoin — if everyone agrees they should be implemented, that is.There’s “Schnorr,” for instance, a technology that could build in functionality into bitcoin to meld transaction signatures together.“For example Schnorr input signature aggregation is way more efficient with 100 people than with [two],” Fiscor said, adding: “Same goes for Bulletproofs. Or just simply tinkering on the optimal mix outputs given a set of inputs.”Fiber optic cable image via Shutterstock"

The sell-off was extended Tuesday with prices hitting a 2.5-week low of $7,432.The drop below the widely followed 4-hour chart’s 200-candle moving average (MA), then located at $7,970, was short-lived, with prices recovering to $7,900 by the early European trading hours on Wednesday.The bounce, however, has stalled near $7,900 over the last 24 hours. The cryptocurrency’s inability to produce a stronger corrective rally despite the defense of crucial support validates buyer exhaustion signaled by last week’s doji candle.Further, the price recovery seems to have taken the shape of a bearish continuation pattern on short duration technical charts. So, prices may end up falling back to the 200 candle MA support, currently at $7,568.At time of writing, BTC is changing hands at $7,810, representing a 0.20 percent gain on a 24-hour basis.BTC has created a bear flag on the 4-hour chart. Acceptance below the lower edge of that pattern, currently at $7,700, would confirm a flag breakdown – a continuation pattern that usually accelerates the preceding bearish move.This type of breakdown is usually followed by a move downwards of roughly the length of the flag’s “pole” (the height of the preceding bear move) – in this case from $8,834 to $7,432, a drop of over $1,000.So, a flag breakdown below $7,700, if confirmed, would theoretically create room for a drop toward $6,800.The probability of BTC breaking the flag to the lower side is high, as the 50-candle MA is now trending south, indicating a bearish setup, and looks set to cross below the 100-candle MA (bearish crossover).The daily chart is biased bearish, with the 5- and 10-day MAs sloping downwards, the relative strength index (RSI) reporting a bearish divergence and a violation of the ascending trendline representing the rally from December lows.What’s more, prices closed below the crucial 30-day MA on Tuesday, confirming a bearish reversal and have struggled to post big gains above the former support-turned-resistance ever since.So risks are skewed to the downside with scope for a drop to the 50-day MA support, currently at $6,861, in the short-term.The drop to toward the 50-day MA, however, could be preceded by a rally to the $8,200–$8,300 range – that’s if the 4-hour chart 200-candle MA at $7,568 again holds ground and fuels a price bounce above $8,000.Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.Bitcoin image via CoinDesk Archives; charts by Trading View"

His white paper begins by calling out Barry Silbert, founder of Grayscale parent Digital Currency Group:The DropGold advertorial campaign has, in my personal view, been poorly conceived, and–as I have repeatedly stated via social media–is so preposterous in its nature as to be akin to uttering phrases like “drop Oxygen” or “drop Copper.” In short, I believe this campaign will not age well, and that it runs the risk of ultimately undermining the ideals and objectives of the cryptocurrency community, which, for the most part, are well-meaning in their desire to reorient society towards a return to the principles of sound commodity money which have underscored and amplified the proliferation of human cooperative societies from time immemorial until the very recent past (with Richard Nixon’s historically unprecedented and ostensibly temporary suspension of the Gold standard in 1971). To be even more explicit, I am sympathetic to the broad vision of the cryptocurrency community and feel that Grayscale and Mr. Silbert, through these actions, have made a critical error in judgement that is neither representative of the community nor beneficial to its core objectives.Sebag goes on to argue that far from being weightless as suggested in the Grayscale ads, bitcoin actually weighs more than gold. After all, it is hosted on heavy servers!
Courtesy of GoldMoneyFurther, he tells us that gold has implicit utility – as a thing used to create more bitcoin!
Courtesy of GoldMoney“Bitcoin needs gold to exist,” writes Sebag. “Gold doesn’t need Bitcoin to exist.”While Sebag is splitting hairs here – after all, bitcoin, as a digital asset, is invisible, tasteless, and odorless while gold is a physical object you can wear around your neck – his point is simply that we shouldn’t yet discount gold as a valuable asset.The market, obviously, would agree, with gold trading well above $1,000 an ounce.

That’s the biggest monthly gain since April 2018, as discussed yesterday.Importantly, April’s close put prices above the 21-month exponential moving average (EMA), currently at $5,248.That EMA had emerged as a strong price floor in the five months to October 2018, forcing many to conclude that the bear market had ended near $6,000. Bitcoin, however, dived below $6,000 on Nov. 14 – falling to lows near $3,100 by mid-December – and, with that, the 21-month EMA became the level to beat for the bulls.Now that BTC has secured a monthly close above that key hurdle, the long-term bearish-to-bullish trend change confirmed on April 2 looks more credible. As a result, a rally to $6,000 in the next few weeks cannot be ruled out.As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $5,300 on Bitstamp – up 2.4 percent on a 24-hour basis.As seen on above left, April’s candle closed just above the 21-month EMA, the first monthly close above the key average since October 2018.The bullish close comes four weeks after bitcoin first confirmed long-term bullish reversal by violating the most basic of all bearish patterns – the lower highs and lower lows – with a high-volume break above $4,236 on April 2.The chart also shows a falling channel breakout, which indicates a bearish-to-bullish trend change. It is worth noting that a similar bearish channel breakout in October 2015 was followed by a 2.5-year bull market (see above right).Essentially, BTC has activated twin bullish cues – a falling channel breakout and a close above the 21-month EMA – with April’s close at $5,269. These developments are remarkably similar to the ones seen in October 2015.The above chart shows bitcoin has again bounced up from the 30-day moving average (MA), weakening the case for a deeper pullback put forward by the bearish divergence on the 14-day relative strength index (RSI).It is worth noting that BTC has suffered significant price pullbacks following the confirmation of the bearish RSI divergence in the past.This time, however, the pattern seems to have failed, with the price bouncing up from the 30-day MA, a sign of strong bullish sentiment. As a result, BTC could revisit and possibly breach the recent high of $5,627 reached on April 23.The case for a temporary pullback to the 50-day MA, currently at $4,706 would strengthen if and when the price closes below the 30-day MA at $5,184.Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.Bitcoin chart featured image via Shutterstock; technical charts by Trading View"

The leading ...","Jun 1, 2019 at 10:00 UTC","The cryptocurrency markets saw rapid growth in May with quite a few outshining the largest by market capitalization, bitcoin. ","The leading cryptocurrency drew most of the attention, rising 67 percent from $5,265 on May 1st to $8,900 by month’s end. A considerable amount of the gains happened in the lead up to the New York Blockchain event, that took place during the second week of May.For instance, sharp rallies in bitcoin’s price on May 11 and May 13 pushed its price tag above $7,000 and then $8,000 for the first time in over a year. Despite logging its best monthly gain since 2017 however, BTC ranks tenth on the list of May’s best-performing cryptocurrencies, according to Messari.io data.  Names like Chainlink (LINK), Dent (DENT), bitcoin SV (BSV), Holochain (HOT) and bitcoin gold (BTG) took a clear lead, each rising between 65 and 256 percent against their respective trading pairs with the U.S dollar.The total capitalization of the broader market excluding bitcoin reflected the growth by rising to $125.6 billion on May 30th– its highest value in nearly 10 months.The performance of individual altcoins when paired against BTC fared much worse, however.Ether’s pairing with BTC, for example, found itself still unable to scale its 200-day moving average for much of the month, and at the time of writing has only increased roughly 2 percent since May 1 whereas its USD pair is currently up over 60 percent in the same time span.Such a discrepancy between the performance of both pairs can be attributed to bitcoin’s price rally inflating the USD value of most altcoins while devaluing in BTC terms. That said, a number of cryptocurrencies were able to flash strong performances in both categories, case in point being the top five performers for the month of May seen below.BSV | Price: $197 | MCAP: $3.5 billion | Percent Change: +231 percentThe crypto project aptly named ‘Satoshi’s Vision’ claims to be the “original bitcoin,” by restoring BTC’s first protocol while stating that it can massively scale with increased stability.Bitcoin SV had a remarkable run during May and was the clear leader during the second half of the month after prices broke out on May 21, bringing it back above the elusive $100 price tag.Prices peaked at $252 according to data from Bittrex after landing itself in overbought territory and triggering a pullback, as shown by the daily relative strength index (RSI) exceeding a value of 70.BSV/USD remains bullishly bid above a technical resistance level of $148, but a strong close below could re-expose the $90 support in the coming weeks. LINK | Price: $1.01 | MCAP: $364.3 million | Percent Change: +96 percentChainlink’s (LINK) staggering 200 percent rise in mid-May suffered a setback as the monthly close approached, but today remains 96 percent up on the month, placing it firmly in 2nd place within the top 5 performers for May.Concerns are now building for greater drawdown, courtesy of a candle close below the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement line on the daily chart, exposing the neutral pivot along the 50 percent retracement at $0.84.Prices remain bullishly bid above the 200-daily moving average (red line) and above a key resistance that became support at $0.68, but expect a pullback if its price breaks below the neutral 50 percent retracement.DENT | Price: $0.001747 | MCAP: $124.1 million | Percent Change: 78 percentDENT is a token issued on the ethereum blockchain that aims to facilitate global communications via its platform and service offerings. Its performance on the month was bullish to say the least, concluding May with a 78 percent higher price than it started and ranking as the 3rd best performer of the month.However, recent market developments have thrown into contention the short-term bullish trend as prices dipped below a key support by the time the monthly trading period came to a close.Similar to that of LINK, the longer term view remains bullish while trading above the 200-day moving average (red line), which looks set to complete positive crossover with the 100-day moving average on another significant upward move.BTG | Price: $26.71 | MCAP: $475.8 million | Percent Change: +64 percentBitcoin Gold (BTG), yet another bitcoin fork, changed BTC’s proof-of-work algorithm from SHA256 to Equihash, rendering specialized mining equipment obsolete in an attempt to democratize the mining process.Traders heavily favored BTG buy opportunities in May, leading it to place as the 5th best-performing crypto this month, outperforming other notable bitcoin forks such as bitcoin diamond (BCD) and bitcoin private (BTCP).BTG’s rising channel spanning more than four months looks set to break down courtesy of a rising wedge (bear reversal pattern) residing within the channel’s most recent price action. In addition, a long upper wick on the daily timeframe is evidence strong sell pressure still exists above $30.Should momentum falter here, a drop in value toward the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement line at $20.34 may be in the offing, but will remain bullish so long as the channel pattern holds.HOT | Price: $0.002165 | MCAP: $288.4 million | Percent Change: +74 percentHolochain (HOT) is a decentralized application platform that uses peer-to-peer networking for processing agent-centric agreement and consensus mechanisms between users.Beginning in late May, HOT managed to break a key resistance zone of $0.0016, carving out a further 57 percent rise in value before prices peaked at $0.0027 on May 29.From there it has been a downhill battle for HOT with the forfeiture of the 38.2 percent retracement line opening up the neutral pivot point at $0.0018 (50 percent retracement).If prices continue to falter, buying pressure is likely to support HOT near $0.0016 due to it being a previous resistance zone.Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.Balloons image via Shutterstock; charts by Trading View"

BTC is currently flatlined above $7,900 on Bitstamp, having hit lows below $7,600 in the early U.S. trading hours yesterday.Notably, the pullback seen in the last 36 hours marks BTC’s third failure in the last seven days to capitalize on a rally to $8,300.Prices rose to a high of $8,335 on May 14, only to register a UTC close at $7,986. On similar lines, BTC faded the spike to $8,390 on May 16 and closed the day in the red at $7,880.The triple rejection comes after a sharp rally from lows near $5,100 seen at the end of April and could be considered a sign of buyer exhaustion. As a result, a fall back to $7,200–$7,000 could be seen in the next day or two.BTC created a bearish “hanging man” or a hammer candle on Monday, which occurs when the price closes in the red, despite a “buy the dip” mentality. The cryptocurrency recovered from the intraday low of $7,581 yesterday, but closed 2.3 percent lower on the day at $8,005.Put simply, the bears are beginning to test the bulls’ strength and the market may be topping out for the short-term.A temporary bullish-to-bearish trend change would be confirmed if the price closes today below $7,581 (candle low). That looks likely, given the repeated rejections at $8,300 in the last seven days.A close below $7,581 would open the doors for a deeper pullback to the historically strong 30-day moving average (MA) support, currently at $6,333.The bearish hammer would be invalidated if prices find acceptance above $8,200 in the next 24 hours. In that case, BTC may rise to $8,500 as suggested by the bullish longer-duration charts.As seen above, BTC picked up a strong bid near $7,300 and jumped to $8,000 in the Asian trading hours on May 19.With the price rally, both the relative strength index and Chaikin money flow (CMF) invalidated bearish divergences by moving above their respective falling trendlines.A failed bearish indicator divergence is often followed by a big move to the higher side. As mentioned, though, BTC only managed to retest $8,300 before falling back below $8,000, indicating buyers are exhausted after engineering a $3,000 rally in just two weeks.Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.Bitcoin image via Shutterstock; technical charts by Trading View"

Currently, the cryptocurrency is trading at $7,530 on Bitstamp, representing a 4 percent drop on the day. Prices hit an intraday low of $7,468 earlier today.Looking forward, the focus is on the key support at $7,200– a level the bulls must defend, as a break lower would confirm a short-term bullish-to-bearish trend change on the technical charts.BTC dived out of the contracting triangle yesterday, validating bullish exhaustion signaled by multiple rejections at $8,300.More importantly, the range breakdown is backed by a bearish below-50 reading on the relative strength index (RSI) and a drop into bearish territory below zero on the the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) histogram.The path of least resistance, therefore, is to the downside.On the daily chart, early signs of temporary bearish reversal have emerged in the form of a “hanging man” candle, as discussed earlier this week. Further, the daily MACD has turned bearish for the first time since May 2 and the RSI continues to create bearish lower highs.BTC, therefore, could complete the forming double-top pattern seen above with a drop to $7,206 (May 18 low) in the next day or two.A UTC close below $7,206 would confirm a double-top breakdown – a short-term bullish-to-bearish trend change – and would create room for a slide to $6,070 (target as per the measured move method).That said, the historically strong support of the 30-day moving average (MA) is currently located at $6,475. That average is seen sloping upwards to $6,500 in the next couple of days. As a result, any following sell-off could be cut short near that level.The outlook would turn bullish if prices rise above $8,050 in the next 24 hours, contradicting the bearish developments on the short-term charts. In that case, a rally to $8,500 (June 2018 high) could be seen.Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.Bitcoin image via Shutterstock; technical charts by Trading View"

After all, BTC rose by 8.29 percent on Sunday – the fourth biggest single-day gain of May.More importantly, the bulls finally managed to force a convincing break above $8,300, having failed at least three times in the preceding 11 days to hold on to gains above that psychological level.Prices also found acceptance above the July 2018 high of $8,500 yesterday.So, the rally from lows below $6,000 looks to have resumed and only a quick fall back below $8,000 would weaken the bullish case.BTC closed well above the May 16 high of $8,390 on Sunday, confirming a pennant breakout – a continuation pattern that usually accelerates the preceding bullish move.This type of breakout is often followed by a move upwards of roughly the length of the pennant’s “pole” (the height of the preceding bull move) – in this case from $5,562 to $8,390).BTC, therefore, has scope to rally at least to $10,000 (psychological resistance) in the near-term.Supporting the bullish case is the Chaikin money flow index of 0.24 – the highest reading since April 10 – meaning that buying pressure is its strongest in nearly six weeks.Further, the 5- and 10-day moving averages (MAs) are trending north, indicating a short-term bullish setup. As a result, these averages, currently located at $8,288 and $8,048, respectively, and may reverse price pullbacks, if any.BTC’s four-week winning run is backed by five-month highs on the Chaikin money flow index – that is, buying pressure is currently the strongest since mid-December,The 5- and 10-week MAs are also sloping upwards in favor of the bulls.While the relative strength index (RSI) is reporting overbought conditions with an above-70 print, the cryptocurrency is showing no signs of bullish exhaustion. The RSI’s overbought signal therefore stands invalidated.To conclude, BTC will likely break above $9,000 in the short-term and may rise to $9,442 – the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of the sell-off from the December 2017 high to December 2017 low.It’s worth noting that prices are currently up more than 65 percent on a month-to-date basis. Pullbacks due to profit taking are usually observed following such stellar rallies.As a result, the possibility of BTC revisiting the former resistance-turned-support zone of $8,390–$8,000 before rising to $9,442 cannot be ruled out.On a year-to-date basis, bitcoin is now up 136 percent.Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.Bitcoin image via Shutterstock; charts by Trading View"

Similar price action unfolded on Sunday, with BTC hitting a high of $5,782 before ending the day at $5,709.It is worth noting that $5,780 was expected to offer stiff resistance. The level is important because BTC’s sell-off from May 2018 highs near $10,000 run out of steam at $5,780 on June 24. Subsequently, a bounce from that level was followed by an over 40 percent price rise to $8,500 by July 24.Bitcoin’s recent failures to cross that threshold suggest a pullback and a bounce from the historically strong support level may be needed to recharge the engines for a sustained rise to $6,000.The case for a price pullback would further strengthen if President Trump’s re-escalation of US-China trade tensions and the resulting slide in equities ends up sending gold higher. This is because the inverse relationship between BTC and gold has recently been its strongest in over 12 months.So far, however, gold has barely benefited from the flight to safety. The safe haven asset is currently trading at $1,283 per ounce, representing a mere 0.17 percent gain on the day. That’s opposed to futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which is down close to 500 points at press time.As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $$5,617 on Bitstamp – a 1.48 percent drop on a 24-hour basis.BTC is currently reporting losses below the former resistance-turned-support of $5,627 (April 23 high), having failed to close (UTC) above the June 2018 bottom of $5,780 for the third straight day on Sunday.The relative strength index (RSI), which had invalidated a bearish divergence with a move above the falling trendline on Friday, has ended up creating another bearish lower high as opposed to higher high on price.As a result, a pullback to the historically strong 30-day moving average (MA) support, currently at $5,294, cannot be ruled out.BTC seems to be creating a double-top pattern with a neckline at $5,510 on the 4-hour chart. A break below that level would create room for a drop to levels below $5,200 (target as per the measured move method).A drop below $5,510 may happen in the next 24 hours or so, as the repeated failure to find acceptance above $5,870 has been accompanied by the bearish divergence on the RSI.Bitcoin closed last week above the 50-week moving average (MA), further strengthening the evidence for a long-term bullish reversal.The weekly chart RSI is also biased bullish, having convincingly scaled the resistance band of 53.00–55.00 last month.The 5- and 10-week MAs are trending north, also indicating a bullish setup. Notably, both MAs are located at $5,386, so that level could work as strong support this week.With the long-term chart looking bullish, a pullback to the 30-day MA or lower could be short-lived. A strong bounce from that average would likely yield a rally to $6,000.That said, the prospects of a deeper slide below $5,000 would improve if prices see back-to-back daily closes below the 30-day MA.Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.Bitcoin image via Shutterstock; charts by Trading View"

However, BTC remains positive over a 7-day period, up $14 billion on the week amid high volatility and market disagreements on its true price.The reasons for the sell-off could be attributed to large sell-orders liquidating numerous stop-loss positions and invoking general panic amongst traders.Indeed a sell-order on the Bitstamp exchange for example, of 3,645 BTC or $26.8 million in US dollar terms, was executed at around 02:00 UTC on May 17 and could have been one of the major causes for a dip below $7,000.It’s no small secret that when bitcoin moves in value, the rest of the crypto markets may also do so as seen by a large capitulation in daily prices which are currently down between 11 and 22 percent amongst the top 100 at CoinMarketCap.Ether (ETH), bitcoin cash (BCH) and litecoin (LTC) all suffered similar losses losing between 8 and 16 percent in value while stellar (XLM), XRP and cardano (ADA) were the hardest hit in the top 10 by market capitalization, dropping 16.3, 16.5, 16.7 percent respectively.The total crypto market capitalization also took a hit dropping more than $29 billion over the last 24-hours hinting at investor uncertainty as they transition to the sidelines to await bitcoin’s next move.Disclosure: The author holds USDT at the time of writing.

BTC was last seen trading at $5,682, representing a 5.6 percent gain on a 24-hour basis.The rally to 5.5-month highs has strengthened the bullish case put forward by the cryptocurrency’s recent bounce from the crucial 30-day moving average (MA) after a drop when the recent Bitfinex controversy hit the news.Further, it validates April’s bullish close above the former support-turned-resistance of the 21-month exponential moving average of the price.Last but not the least, with the recent bounce from levels below $5,000, the cryptocurrency has invalidated a strong bearish indicator pattern, as seen in the chart below. As a result, prices could rise to $6,000 over the next few days.As seen above (prices via Bitstamp), the 30-day MA has lived up to its reputation of being strong support by reversing the price pullback from highs above $5,600 to $5,000.More importantly, with the bounce, the relative strength index (RSI) seems to have found acceptance above the descending trendline, representing a bearish divergence confirmed on April 24.In the past, BTC has suffered significant price pullbacks following the confirmation of the bearish divergence of the RSI. This time, however, the pattern failed – a sign of strong bullish sentiment.What’s more, the Chaikin money flow index, used to measure the money flow volume over a set period of time (usually 21 days), has risen from 0.0036 to 0.12 in the last few days, confirming the uptrend in price.So, BTC could close well above the April 23 high of $5,627 today, further strengthening the case for a rally to $6,000.On the way higher, BTC may encounter resistance at $5,780 (June 2018 bottom) and $5,880 (August 2018 bottom), as discussed yesterday.Bitcoin has breached the 50-week MA resistance, currently at $5,418, on the weekly chart. However, confirmation of the breakout is needed in the form of a close above $5,418 on Sunday (UTC).The case for a pullback to levels below $5,000 would strengthen if the buyers fail to keep prices above the key average for the second week.Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.Balloon image via Shutterstock; charts by Trading View"

creator Satoshi Nakamoto himself shortly after the software's launch and ...","May 18, 2019 at 10:20 UTC",Can a logo symbolize the ethos of a project? An industry? An entire movement?,"This is perhaps too much meaning to attribute to any one design, but if any logo has come close to the task, it’s that of bitcoin.Belonging to no corporation, no in-house graphic design team at a shiny Silicon Valley startup, bitcoin’s logo has given the faceless project’s many adherents an image to hold on to. And not only to hold on to – but to emblazon on shirts, stick to laptops and stamp on physical coins – giving the digital project a material existence that has been crucial for its propagation.Perhaps more importantly, the collaborative development of bitcoin’s unofficial logo framed its encounter with the rest of the world.In creating a symbol that resembled those of other currencies, bitcoin was visually introduced to newcomers as money. And in elaborating this symbol into a logo that could reside alongside Visa and Mastercard stickers on shop windows, bitcoin was simultaneously and distinctly established as a payment method.But bitcoin’s current logo is far from its first.The story of the bitcoin logo, much like the cryptocurrency itself, is one of evolution, one of facelifts, community collaboration and – occasionally – of controversy.The earliest iteration of the logo was rendered by pseudonymous bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto himself shortly after the software’s launch and featured a BC on a gold coin.Little is known about the original logo, as its creation predated the popular Bitcoin Talk forum. However, it is notable that in imitating the appearance of a gold coin, the icon references metallism. This monetary system, in which the value of money is derived from the exchange value of the commodity on which it is based (like gold or silver), is an ideal to which many bitcoin enthusiasts subscribe.Within Bitcoin Talk, it’s difficult to tell whether users appreciated the original icon or not. Some users proposed alternatives to “BC” such as the Thai baht symbol and the ampersand, while others suggested a combination of both the Thai baht symbol and the Costa Rican colon symbol.Several users suggested adding a T to the symbol – making it BTC – which remains the ticker symbol for the cryptocurrency today.Other users, however, argued that it was unnecessary to adopt a standard symbol at all.“The spirit of bitcoin is that there is no need for a central authority or ‘official’ policy as with other currencies,” one Bitcoin Talk user, Timo Y, wrote, adding:“We should just let it evolve organically, like a word in a natural language.”Satoshi continued to experiment with the logo.He updated his original graphic over a year later, shedding the “BC” in favor of the now ubiquitous “B” with two vertical strokes.The logo was largely well-received by Bitcoin Talk users. However, some objected that the new “B” resembled the Thai baht symbol too closely, and worried that it could create confusion. Others criticized the design for its lack of professional polish.One such user wrote, “Is there a reason we couldn’t adopt something else before bitcoin gets too big and it’s too late to change without hurting ‘brand’ recognition? It seems silly to stick with something that is ‘ok’ when we could have something great.”Out of thin air – that’s effectively where bitcoin’s most recognizable logo, and its creator, came from. With his first post on Bitcoin Talk, a still unidentified user going by the handle “bitboy” forever changed the visual legacy of bitcoin.However, you wouldn’t know it from his humble message:“Hi guys, just drop by to say hi and to share with you some of the graphics I have done. Hope you will find them useful.”And useful they have been. Orange, flat and off-kilter, these graphics are widely utilized and riffed upon today.Bitboy transformed Satoshi’s original concept into a more readable, scalable logo that was more brand-able than a simple gold coin. And this seems to have been intentional. Bitboy’s comments on Bitcoin Talk suggest the designs were created with something akin to marketing in mind.Paradoxically, though, bitboy was inspired by some of the companies bitcoin hopes to unseat.When another Bitcoin Talk user commented that the designs resembled the Mastercard logo, bitboy replied, “That’s the inspiration. The irony is as much as I hate [Mastercard] and [Visa], it is all about perception when it comes to consumer confidence and behavior. Lol”The logo’s nod to Mastercard hasn’t been the only push to define bitcoin as a payment method, and the comparison has since created additional pressure for bitcoin and its developers as the project has had to contend with its scaling limitations.The appeal of bitboy’s designs has also arguably been crucial to the commodification of bitcoin. A Google search suggests bitcoin merchandise has become a burgeoning industry, with more than 11 million results for the search term “bitcoin merchandise” and 34 million results for the term “bitcoin t-shirt.”Still, not everyone has been on board with bitcoin’s de facto logo.Some, like those behind bitcoinsymbol.org, have been campaigning for years to change it. In fact, they don’t want bitcoin to have anything akin to a logo.“It’s a unique image file, just like it could be used by a company to sell or promote a product,” the website, which was created by graphic design studio ECOGEX, objects. “Currencies are represented by symbols like $, € or ¥, aiming to be used everywhere by everybody.”As such, the group advocated for the adoption of the Ƀ, which is a letter in multiple alphabets including that of Latin and several languages in Vietnam. Speaking to their reasons, the group argues, “As a widely distributed, peer-to-peer digital currency, bitcoin needs an open-source graphic identity, designed with open source software by and for the community.”It wouldn’t be bitcoin without a bit of controversy, however.This particular controversy began to brew during the fall of 2016, when Phil Wilson (who uses the handle ‘Scronty’) took to Reddit, claiming that he was one of three persons collectively comprising Satoshi Nakamoto.While Wilson lacks blockchain-based evidence for this – such as the private key to move old funds linked to Satoshi – he published extensive instructions on how to construct both Satoshi’s second gold coin logo and the bitboy’s logos.These directions were part of a lengthy account of bitcoin’s early history that was later published by Wilson on a dedicated website. The elaborate nature of his story prompted some in the crypto industry to wonder if Wilson was, in fact, part of a team that created the bitcoin software.Yet, Wilson also alleged that Martti Malmi, the second-ever developer of bitcoin who is also known as “Sirius,” helped with the execution of the second gold coin logo.But Malmi has denied any involvement, leading many to suspect that Wilson’s claims amount to nothing more than extensive fan fiction about bitcoin’s origin myth.Bitcoin image via CoinDesk archive"

The volume numbers reported by CoinMarketCap and other data aggregators are “wrong” and “wildly inflated,” the firm argued. It did, however, concede that CoinMarketCap has “embarked on a serious initiative to improve transparency, disclosure and accuracy.”On the other hand, the “real” bitcoin market is “extremely efficient,” Bitwise said: “After you remove the fake volume and fake data from the equation, you are left with an extremely efficient and orderly market, and one that is backstopped by a regulated derivatives market of significant size.”It continued:“Public perception, however, holds nearly the opposite point-of-view, believing the bitcoin market to be uniquely disorderly and inefficient.”According to the paper, Binance, Bitfinex, Coinbase, Kraken, Bitstamp, BitFlyer, Gemini, itBit, Bittrex, and Poloniex are the only 10 exchanges with real trading volumes, with numbers that align more easily with related real-world statistics, including gross domestic product, wealth, web traffic and blockchain-related venture investments.In its conclusion, the firm said:“In times of rapid change, people’s perceptions often anchor in the past. People who read about bitcoin today still think about Mt. Gox, when they should be thinking about Fidelity; they think about Silk Road, when they should be thinking about Whole Foods. This vestigial anchoring is made worse by the poor quality of data that permeates large parts of the bitcoin ecosystem, which can create the perception that the market remains inefficient, chaotic and issue-prone.”The white paper comes less than two weeks after the SEC once again delayed a decision on whether to approve or reject Bitwise’s bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) proposal filed with NYSE Arca. The regulator has yet to approve any bitcoin ETFs, though experts in the space and officials with the agency seem to believe that it’s only a matter of time before a proposal ticks all the right boxes.Chart image via Shutterstock "

Prices have been restricted to a narrow range of $8,940–$8,650 for more than 24 hours now.The range-bound trading marks a weak follow-through to Sunday’s bullish close. The path of least resistance, however, remains to the upside with the price staying well above the former resistance-turned-support of $8,390.Further, the price congestion has taken the shape of a technical pattern called a “bull flag” – a pause that often refreshes higher.A break above the upper edge the flag, currently at $8,890, would confirm a flag breakout and accelerate the move toward $10,000.BTC has created a bull flag pattern following an upside break of a pennant pattern on Sunday.A flag breakout, if confirmed, would create room for a rally to $9,940 (target as per the measured move method, i.e. pole height added to the breakout price).The pennant breakout has already opened the doors to $10,000, as discussed yesterday.On the way higher, BTC may encounter resistance at $9,942 – the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of the sell-off from the December 2017 high to December 2018 low.It is worth noting that the 50-, 100-, and 200-hour moving averages are trending north in favor of the bulls. The stacking order of the 50-hour MA, above the 100-hour MA, above the 200-hour MA is also a classic bull signal.A flag breakout therefore, looks likely. The bullish MA studies also indicate that a flag breakdown (move below $8,620), if confirmed, could end up trapping sellers on the wrong side of the market.The daily chart remains biased toward the bulls with the 5- and 10-day MAs trending north and the Chaikin money flow index printing positive – a sign of strong buying pressures.Pullbacks, if any, will likely be reversed by the 5- and 10-day MAs, currently located at $8,454 and $8,193, respectively.Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.Bitcoin image via Shutterstock; charts by Trading View"

Prices hit a high of $8,032 earlier today.  The 7 percent rise from the previous day’s low of $7,468 is noteworthy as the short-term technical charts had turned bearish earlier this week. For instance, bitcoin dived out of a narrowing range on Wednesday, strengthening the case for pullback to $7,200 put forward by Monday’s “hanging man” candle. The rise back to $8,000, therefore, could embolden buyers – more so, as the list of long-term technical indicators signaling a bull market continues to grow.The latest to join the bandwagon is the 200-day moving average (MA) – a widely tracked barometer of long-term market trend. The MA shed bearish bias (flattened out) in the first half of this month and is now beginning to curl upwards, further confirming a long-term bearish-to-bullish trend change signaled by several indicators over the last few weeks. As seen above, the 200-day MA has turned bullish for the first time since May 2018. As of writing, the average is located at $4,500.It is worth noting that moving average studies are based on past data and tend to lag price. The 200-day MA’s bullish turn, therefore, likely reflects the recent price rally.Hence, short-term corrective pullbacks are not ruled out. Should prices move below that MA, the long-term bullish outlook would weaken.As for the next 24 hours, BTC could rise to $8,300, according to a bull breakout seen on the short-term technical charts.BTC witnessed a bull flag breakout on the hourly chart (above left) earlier today – a continuation pattern that often accelerates the preceding bullish move. The cryptocurrency, therefore, has a scope for a rise to $8,400 (target as per the measured height method).The hourly chart also shows an upside break of the falling channel (lower highs and lower lows). The relative strength index (RSI) is now biased bullish above 50, having breached the descending trendline in favor of the bulls earlier this week. Meanwhile, on the 4-hour chart (above right), the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) histogram has crossed over to bullish territory above zero and the RSI has violated the falling trendline in favor of the bulls. With the odds stacked in favor of the bulls, BTC could challenge the recent high of $8,390 in the next day or two. A violation there would expose next major resistance at $8,500 (June 2018 high). Even so, the bulls need to observe caution, as trading volumes have dropped over the last seven days as seen in the chart below.Bitcoin’s rise from last Friday’s low of $6,178 is accompanied by lower highs on the volume bars. That bearish divergence puts a question mark on the sustainability of recent gains and a further rise to $8,300, if any. That said, the case for a fall back to $6,000 would strengthen only if the price closes below $7,206, confirming a double-top breakdown, as discussed yesterday.Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.Bitcoin image via Shutterstock; charts by Trading View"

The follow-through has been positive, as well.Yes, as trading volumes haven’t picked along with the price rise, the breakout lacks substance.For instance, bitcoin’s 24-hour trading volume across all cryptocurrency exchanges currently stands at $19 billion – down 42 percent from the high of $33 billion seen on May 16, according to CoinMarketCap.More importantly, daily trading volume has averaged roughly $18 billion throughout the recent recovery from $7,500 to $8,300, which is significantly lower than the sell volume of $24 billion and $29 billion seen on May 30 and June 4.While the wider market is reported to be rife with inflated volumes, the numbers from major exchanges included in the calculation of Bitwise’s “real” bitcoin trading volume also show the recent price rise is not backed by big volumes.The top cryptocurrency by market capitalization is currently trading at $8,270 on Bitstamp, having hit a high of $8,335 in the U.S. trading hours yesterday.Bitcoin’s daily trading volume consistently printed above its 50-day moving average throughout the price rise from $4,000 to $9,000.However, volume has been sitting below the 50-day average since June 6, putting a question mark on the sustainability of the rally from $7,500 to $8,300.As can be seen above left, bitcoin trading volumes on Bitstamp have tapered off significantly over the last 10 days, with volume bars consistently printing lower highs.Volumes continue to remain low despite the bearish channel breakout witnessed earlier this week – a sign of low investor confidence in the price rise. Further, volume numbers on Coinbase and Bitfinex (above right) paint a similar picture.That bearish divergence of trading volumes indicates the cryptocurrency may dive out of the rising wedge pattern (above left), confirming an end of the bounce from lows near $7,500.A wedge breakdown, if confirmed, could yield a sell-off to $8,000. Acceptance below that psychological support would expose recent lows near $7,500.If trading volumes improve in the next 24 hours, bitcoin will likely rise well above $8,500, validating Wednesday’s falling channel breakout.Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.Bitcoin image via CoinDesk archives; charts by Trading View"

However, it may well be that it is a counter to Wright’s move to assert ownership of fundamental bitcoin property. That came amid a flurry of legal threats from Wright against those who claim he is not Satoshi as he has claimed on various occasions – though he has yet to provide indisputable proof, such as a movement of Satoshi’s bitcoin.Wright is also a key mover behind the cryptocurrency Bitcoin SV (for “Satoshi Vision”) and said he would put the copyright registration in the hands of the foundation managing the token.A press release sent to CoinDesk at the time reads:“In the future, Wright intends to assign the copyright registrations to Bitcoin Association to hold for the benefit of the Bitcoin ecosystem. Bitcoin Association is a global industry organization for Bitcoin businesses. It supports BSV and owns the Bitcoin SV client software.”To be clear, a registration is not recognition of a work’s authorship by the U.S. Copyright Office. The copyright process allows anyone to register a work, often in relation to lawsuits associated with ownership.Indeed, the office said in a press release after the Wright registrations stirred up something of a storm, that it has not “recognized” anyone as the inventor of bitcoin.“As a general rule, when the Copyright Office receives an application for registration, the claimant certifies as to the truth of the statements made in the submitted materials. The Copyright Office does not investigate the truth of any statement made,” the Copyright Office wrote.“In a case in which a work is registered under a pseudonym, the Copyright Office does not investigate whether there is a provable connection between the claimant and the pseudonymous author,” it clarified.The same will apply to the registration by Wei Liu.Bitcoin image via Shutterstock"

The most optimistic are forecasting a rerun of bitcoin’s fall 2015 bounce from its prior post-bubble collapse, which sent it not only back above its 2013 high of $1,150 but all the way to a December 2017 peak of $19,500.At the same time, bitcoin skeptics have pointed to the seeming lack of fundamental news behind the price rise and declared it meaningless. Typical of the genre, Matt Novak at Gizmodo penned an angry screed titled “Bitcoin Surges 15% Overnight Because Nobody Learned Their Lesson After the Last Crash.”One of Novak’s insights: “To be clear, bitcoin is absolutely worthless by any real measure. It’s fake money that’s about as practical to use in the real world as Monopoly bills.”Readers won’t be surprised to hear that I disagree with Novak’s simplistic rant. But I’m also turned off by the knee-jerk cheerleading from crypto traders whenever bitcoin’s price bounces.There’s something fundamentally wrong with reducing the measure of bitcoin’s worldwide importance to a price metric that’s denominated in a fiat currency that its advocates hope to replace. It pushes the debate into an inane all-or-nothing binary set of predictions: bitcoin is either going to zero or “to the moon.”What matters is that 10 years after an unidentified software engineer created it, this decentralized system for recording sequences of transactions continues to do its job, block after block, with no authority in charge, no user able to alter past transactions, and no person or entity able to shut it down.The more this goes on, the more it reinforces the powerful vision behind bitcoin: a peer-to-peer, disintermediated system for exchanging value around the world. And in that context, we can also think of bitcoin the cryptocurrency – differentiated from bitcoin the system – as a unique, provably scarce digital asset that expresses the overall value in that vast potential.A point that’s lost on critics like Novak is that the longer bitcoin simply survives – in the face of the $90 billion valuation that stands as a de facto bounty for hackers to try to take it down, compromise its security or corrupt it – the more its overall value is confirmed.Bitcoin is progressively proving itself to be an unstoppable, digital system of global exchange, one that functions outside of the traditional national government-mandated system of currency and banking. That status is what gives bitcoin its value.Of course, the global impact of the bitcoin value exchange system, and therefore its worth to humanity, will be significantly enhanced if adoption advances to a much wider scale and it is used frequently in the world’s transactions. And, yes, a great deal of development work is still needed if it is to ever reach that point.(Some recent technological leaps such as the Lightning Network and the emergence of decentralized, non-custodial asset exchange technologies offer hope that this scaling challenge can be achieved, though nothing is guaranteed.)However, widespread adoption in payments is not necessary for bitcoin to have value. To understand why that’s the case, it’s useful to think about gold, to which bitcoin is often compared.Similar to bitcoin, gold is a mutually agreed store of value that, for all intents and purposes, lies outside the control of nation-state governments and banks. It’s not widely used as a day-to-day currency, but it does enjoy a widespread, shared belief in its value.Where does gold’s value come from? The answer is somewhat tautological: it comes from that same widely held belief, from a shared understanding in gold’s capacity to function as a depoliticized global system of exchange that’s free of manipulation. Sure, we tend to think of gold in terms of its material qualities: that it’s durable and that it’s shiny in a way that connotes beauty. But its lasting worth really derives from the more esoteric notion that human beings have for a long time deeply held a shared belief in its value.That belief has turned gold into a system for protecting property, a system used through the centuries by refugees, dissidents and investors for moving and storing value and for hedging against lost spending power. That we now have a digital version of this concept, one that’s designed for the borderless, internet-shaped world of the 21st century, is a big deal.When dealing with debates over bitcoin’s value, it’s also worth going a little way down the rabbit hole of thinking about what money actually is. Not everyone agrees on a definition, but I think it’s useful to think of money as a societally agreed system for storing and exchanging value. The system has to have certain properties for people to reach this agreement – it must fungible, durable, transferable, divisible, etc. – but it’s the agreement itself that gives it its value.Here, too, is where many of bitcoin’s detractors get lost.Fixating on the misplaced idea of money as a thing, they exclaim that bitcoin can’t have any value as it isn’t backed by anything. This, of course, also misses the fact that it is backed by the energy and other resources that miners spend to do the computational work needed to secure the bitcoin ledger.But the bigger point is that bitcoin’s value, as with all forms of money, comes from the existence of a wide agreement in its potential use as a store of value and medium of exchange.In bitcoin’s case, the agreement is arguably one that involves 35 million people, if Cambridge University’s latest survey of authenticated users is to be believed. This large level of participation is essentially why bitcoin holds a much greater value than the altcoins that are forks of its code.So, this is why bitcoin at $5,000 is important, not because it’s a sign of that new investors are coming to push up its price again, but because it validates the core proposition of bitcoin’s resilience and promise.Bitcoin puzzle via Shutterstock"

Further, prices also rallied 21 percent and 3 percent in one month following the blockchain week in September 2015 and May 2016, respectively.In last year’s bear market, however, prices dropped from $8,700 to $5,780 in five weeks following the blockchain and crypto gathering in mid-May, indicating that broader market sentiment is the greater driving factor.BTC is trading well above the crucial resistance of $5,780 (June 2018 low) on the daily chart (above left). It’s worth noting that the cryptocurrency has failed three times in the last four trading days to secure a UTC close above that level.The focus, therefore, is on the UTC close. The case for a sustained rise to $6,200 and above would strengthen if the price closes today above $5,780.However, a pullback to $5,000 could be seen in the short-term if we see a UTC close below $5,686 (daily opening price), leaving a candle with a long upper shadow in its wake – an early sign of bearish reversal.A bullish close looks the more likely if we take into account a diamond breakout seen in the 4-hour chart (above right), indicating the rally from the April 25 low of $4,991 has resumed and the next major resistance band of $6,100–$6,200 could soon come into play.That said, a move above $6,000 could be short-lived or remain elusive, with the long duration chart below questioning the sustainability of the recent gains.On the 3-day chart, volume bars have consistently printed lower highs, contradicting the higher lows and higher highs on price.Further, trading volume (red arrows) on red candles (drop in prices) has been bigger than the volume on green candles (uptick in the price), which could be considered a sign of weakening buying pressure.Validating that argument is the bearish divergence of the Chaikin money flow index, which is yet to challenge the high of 0.231 seen on April 2, despite prices being at near 6-month highs.The Chaikin money flow index measures the money flow volume over a set period of time (usually 21 days) to gauge buying and selling pressure.Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.Bitcoin image via Shutterstock; charts by Trading View"

Gox manager Mark Karpeles is looking for a second act.,"Karpeles, the author of the new book “Cryptocurrency 3.0,” has come out as vocal proponent of improved security on the blockchain and bitcoin. “It is dangerous that Bitcoin will continue to exist with the current encryption technology,” he said in a wide-ranging interview with CoinDesk Japan.In February 2014, Karpeles announced that hackers had stolen 850,000 bitcoin from Mt. Gox over the preceding year. The site, originally a “Magic: The Gathering” trading site, morphed into a bitcoin exchange and was one of the first places many crypto luminaries bought and sold bitcoin. The firm went bankrupt. Karpeles admitted fault and Japanese police arrested him. The hack was, in short, the definitive moment for cryptocurrency. In a heartbeat the industry went from clever toy to a serious – and expensive – business.“Although I was able to win my case in March 2019, I am very sorry that I caused a great deal of damage to customers and caused inconvenience to the people involved,” he said.In the interview, he described the difficulties of running a popular exchange from his office in Japan.“When I took over the management of Mt. Gox in 2011, I worked with the members of the field and a team of lawyers from various countries in order to cope with the system issues that will be discovered one after another and the rapidly increasing transaction volume,” he said. “I was monitoring on a 24-hour basis. At that time, it would be nice if I could sleep for 2 hours. Dealing with time difference between foreign countries meant I sometimes had a conferences scheduled for 2 or 3 o’clock in the morning.”“Perhaps now, the people in charge of operating the virtual currency exchange centers have learned to manage this pressure. However, human error can not be prevented as long as risk is covered manually,” he said.Karpeles now believes that administrators must rebuild the entire bitcoin security infrastructure.“There is still the risk of the virtual currency being stolen as a PC or hardware wallet may be hacked. In other words, with the current mechanisms and technologies, it is still impossible to eliminate risk. Innovation of cryptographic technology is a must,” he said.“The point is encryption technology. Bitcoin itself has been using a technology called ECDSA from the beginning, and has never been hacked,” he said. “However, as it is difficult to eliminate hacking damage, you will have to think that there is also no permanently safe cryptographic technology. It is dangerous that Bitcoin will continue to exist with the current encryption technology.”Karpeles wants security to be as simple – and visible – as the move from standard “http” to web sites secured by Secure Socket Layer (SSL) or Transport Layer Security (TLS).To that end, he’s announced the creation of a new startup called Tristan Technologies Co that aims to build this new tech.He said he still finds the cryptocurrency space magical, however, and there is still a whisper of the young man that took over an early exchange and created a worldwide sensation.“As I wrote in my book ‘Cryptocurrency 3.0,’ I love Japanese animation, but one of the most impressive movies I’ve seen recently is ‘The Promised Neverland,’” he said. “It is a story in which children escape from a place where they are trapped. How will each child deal with harsh and unfriendly reality? I watched the anime with great interest.”

exchange by volume was hacked when developer Jeremy Rubin, who has ...","May 8, 2019 at 19:41 UTC",What started with a single tweet quickly turned into an escalating debate Wednesday when the CEO of one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges appeared to entertain the idea of encouraging revisions to the bitcoin blockchain.,"Following Wednesday’s revelation that crypto exchange Binance was robbed of 7,000 BTC (worth about $40 million), a proposal was floated to conduct a transaction “reorg” on the bitcoin blockchain, sparking a fiery debate and community uproar.The idea was suggested a few hours after the world’s largest crypto exchange by volume was hacked when developer Jeremy Rubin, who has worked on bitcoin and Stellar’s core code, tweeted to the founder and CEO of Binance:“[Changpeng Zhao] if you reveal your private keys for the hacked coins… you can decentralized-ly at zero cost to you coordinate a reorg to undo the theft.”Rubin essentially suggested that by getting a majority of miners onboard, the transaction history could be adjusted so that the funds are instead broken up and sent to them instead. This “reorganization” would come at some cost, but it would prevent the 7,000 BTC from staying in the hands of the hackers. Further, it wouldn’t have constituted a pure rollback, or a reversal of the transaction history writ-large.The idea was subsequently raised during an ask-me-anything session held by Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, sparking a round of speculation that ended with Zhao ultimately dismissing the idea.As the tweet caught attention, the conversation quickly boiled over given the topic of discussion – there have been very few changes to the bitcoin blockchain’s transaction history in its 10 years of operation, as doing so has been reserved for dire emergencies in which there may be critical consensus failures.“To clarify, the proposal by [Rubin] and [James Prestwich] is to construct a [transaction] that would keep all other transactions and just distribute the hacker coins to miners,” tweeted Zhou. “It’s not: a rollback of any transaction, nor is it reverting funds back to Binance.”The proposal caused an uproar on social media. As developer Udi Wertheimer tweeted in response:“The idea that this rollback of days would even be practical at all for anyone involved is insane. A day of mining costs 1800 BTC. Rolling back four days costs more than the hack itself.”Others seemed to agree that the sheer financial incentives for such a feat would simply be infeasible.“The losses are still at a minimum [7,250] BTC,” wrote developer Jimmy Song about rough costs for Binance to sufficiently incentivize miners to rewrite part of the transaction history of the bitcoin network.At the same time, infeasibility and impossibility are two separate matters. When explaining why Binance would ultimately not be pursuing a chain reorganization or “reorg” as suggested by Rubin, Zhou listed four separate reasons none of which had anything to do with the monetary cost.“1. We may damage credibility of BTC. 2. We may cause a split in both the bitcoin network and community…3. The hackers did demonstrate certain weak points in our design and user confusion that was not obvious before. 4. While it was a very expensive lesson for us, it is nevertheless a lesson,” listed Zhou on Twitter.Zhou’s reasoning highlighted a key concern many have voiced in the past when it comes to blockchain immutability not just on bitcoin but all proof-of-work (PoW) blockchains.“If you bribe 51 percent of the miners, they will change the ledger for you. [This] tells you just how little irreversibility there is in PoW coins,” tweeted Cornell University professor and researcher in blockchain consensus protocols Emin Gün Sirer.A 51% attack on the blockchain network is not a new attack vector for PoW blockchains. However, as highlighted by Gün Sirer, it’s also not really an attack vector. On very special instances, the majority of self-interested miners on PoW blockchains have voluntarily agreed to alter a transaction history to undo critical situations.While the situation isn’t entirely the same, in the past, blockchain networks have seen their histories altered in the wake of critical moments. This happened on the ethereum blockchain back in 2016 when over $60 million worth of coins were siphoned off from the now-defunct smart contract The DAO. It also happened on the vericoin blockchain back in 2014 after $8 million worth of coins were hacked.While controversial, both decisions were supported by the primary developer community who launched system-wide upgrades or hard forks to enable otherwise infeasible amendments to the blockchain transaction history.Yet those choices weren’t without their repercussions; the resulting ethereum fork resulted in two distinct chains, ethereum and ethereum classic, respectively.Still, many in the bitcoin community took to social media to deride the idea as both infeasible as well against the philosophical underpinnings of the technology.In Binance’s particular case, prominent members of the bitcoin community point out that bitcoin being the world’s largest blockchain is a particularly unique case with a reputation to uphold.“Talk of forking or reorganizing the blockchain is close to heresy,” tweeted billionaire bitcoin investor Michael Novogratz. “When the ethereum community did it the project was like 5 months old. A baby. Bitcoin now has $100bn market cap and is a legitimate store of wealth.”It would also be unfair according to Adam Back – CEO of bitcoin development startup Blockstream – given that the latest Binance hack is nowhere near as severe as previous hacks suffered on the bitcoin blockchain.“A Bitcoin reorg is just not happening, and I doubt any Bitcoin industry, miners nor developers considered it either. Recall 2014 $473mil, 2016 bitfinex hack $72mil, 2019 binance $40mil etc. #NotHappening,” tweeted Back.Binance image via Shutterstock"

However, as bitcoin set the new higher high, the RSI instead formed a bearish divergence – a pattern confirmed with the near 2 percent price drop seen in the last 24 hours.As can be seen above, BTC confirmed a bearish divergence of the RSI with a 2 percent drop to $9,623 on May 6, 2018, and fell 38 percent to lows below $5,800 by the end of June.Before that, the 14-day RSI diverged in favor of the bears with bitcoin’s 6.5 percent price drop to $17,700 on Dec. 19, 2017. That was followed by a quick 36 percent sell-off to $11,200 by Dec. 22.There are earlier notable examples, too (not shown). BTC fell 6.5 percent to $4,600 on Sept. 2, 2017. With the sharp slide, the RSI diverged in favor of the bears and prices tumbled to $2,972 on Sept. 15. Again that was a 36 percent price drop.Another bearish divergence of the RSI on June 12, 2017, was also followed by a quick 20 percent price slide that ended at lows near $2,120 a few days later.If history is any guide, the latest bearish divergence of the RSI could send prices down to $4,912 (April 12 low).The 30-day moving average (MA), which served as strong support in March, is currently located at $4,969. Importantly, the average is still trending north, indicating a bullish setup.A strong defense of that average would revive the short-term bullish outlook and could yield a rally to fresh multi-month high above the recent high of $5,627.A violation there, however, could invite stronger selling pressure, leading to a drop to the 200-day MA at $4,466.The longer-term outlook will remain bullish as long as prices are holding above $4,236 – the bearish lower high created on Dec. 24 and violated on April 2.Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.Bitcoin image via Shutterstock; charts by Trading View"

the 50- and 200-day moving averages – for the first time since October ...","Apr 23, 2019 at 11:00 UTC","With bitcoin’s (BTC) move to five-month highs Tuesday, a notable bull cross of key moving averages has formed for the first time in nearly four years.","The crypto market leader jumped to $5,627 on Bitstamp earlier today – the highest level since Nov. 18 – having revived the short-term bullish case with a repeated defense of key support at $5,170 last week.Meanwhile, the 50-day moving average (MA) has crossed the 200-day MA from below, confirming a long-term bullish pattern known as a “golden crossover” in technical parlance. This is the first golden crossover since October 28, 2015. Many analysts consider the indicator an advanced warning of stronger price gains in the long term.The crossover, however, is based on moving averages, which are backward-looking in nature. For instance, the 50-day MA is based on 1.5-month old data, while the 200-day MA responds to more than six-month-old price action.Hence, the indicator is more a confirmation of the recent bull run, rather than a signal of further price gains.That said, the investor community may take heart from the fact that bitcoin’s previous bull market began just two days after the golden crossover in 2015.As can be seen (above left), the 50-day MA last crossed the 200-day MA from below on Oct. 28, 2015, and prices confirmed a long-term bearish-to-bullish trend change with a close above $319 (July 12, 2015 high) two days later.The follow-through to that positive trend change was strong and BTC went on to reach an all-time high of $20,000 by December 2017.This time round, the confirmation of the golden crossover has been preceded by the violation of the bearish lower highs and lower lows pattern on April 2.While there is a reason to be optimistic, the golden crossover lags price, as discussed earlier. Further, it tends to work as a contrary indicator in the short-term if the market is looking overbought, which looks to be the case currently.The cryptocurrency’s move to five-month highs has pushed the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) above 70 – a sign of overbought conditions. Hence, a price pullback cannot be ruled out in the short term.Supporting that argument is bitcoin’s long/short ratio, which has shed the bullish bias. The ratio of BTC/USD long to short positions on Bitfinex (right) is currently hovering just below 1.00 – the lowest level since early January – having printed a high of 1.53 on April 8.The sharp decline indicates the sentiment has turned from bullish to neutral over the last 15 days. Note that a reading well below 1.00 indicates a bearish bias, while an above-1.00 print represents a bullish market.A close above the April 10 high of $5,466 would establish another bullish higher high and strengthen the case for a rally toward $6,000.However, with the golden crossover accompanied by the overbought readings on the RSI, as well as a bullish-to-neutral shift in the long/short ratio, prices may fail to close above $5,466 or the bullish close could be short-lived.The odds of a fallback to $5,000 would rise if today’s candle ends in the red well below $5,466, validating the lower high (bearish divergence) of the RSI.Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.Bitcoin image via Shutterstock; charts by Trading View"

As part of the move, police seized six servers based in Luxembourg and the Netherlands.Coin mixers or “tumblers” like Bestmixer.io work by pooling funds together and creating a web of new transactions in an effort to obfuscate their original source. Typically, coin mixer users pay a fee on top of the funds they send in, receiving back their money from a wholly new address.Europol alleged that much of the money that passed through Bestmixer.io “had a criminal origin or destination,” contending that “in these cases, the mixer was probably used to conceal and launder criminal flows of money.” The agency said that the service, which launched in May 2018, mixed approximately 27,000 bitcoins.“Today’s Bestmixer seizure shows an increase in law enforcement activities on pure crypto-to-crypto services,” said Dave Jevans, CipherTrace CEO. “This follows on the heels of European AMLD5 regulations and the views expressed by US FinCEN that crypto-to-crypto services are considered to be money services businesses and must comply with those regulations. This is the first public seizure of a bitcoin mixing service, and shows that not only are dark marketplaces subject to criminal enforcement, but other services are as well.”Europol’s statement suggests that the investigation isn’t complete and that authorities intend to follow up on the information gleaned from this week’s server seizures.“The Dutch FIOD has gathered information on all the interactions on this platform in the past year. This includes IP-addresses, transaction details, bitcoin addresses and chat messages,” the agency said. “This information will now be analysed by the FIOD in cooperation with Europol and intelligence packages will be shared with other countries.”“Bestmixer has blatantly advertised money laundering services, and falsely claimed to be domiciled in Curacao where they claimed it was a legal service. The reality is that they were operating in Europe and services customers from many countries around the world,” said Jevans.Mixed marbles image via Shutterstock"

Machado wants to help his homeland while remaining realistic about ...","May 10, 2019 at 13:00 UTC",Open Money Initiative (OMI) co-founder and Venezuelan expat Alejandro Machado wants to help his homeland while remaining realistic about bitcoin.,"The truth is, Venezuelans haven’t abandoned the inflation-riddled bolivar as quickly as he expected, namely because it is so difficult to use digital currencies inside Venezuela’s borders.“No one wants [the bolivar] but people need it to survive,” Machado said.Now his San Francisco-based nonprofit OMI is teaming up with crypto industry incumbents, like the peer-to-peer exchange LocalBitcoins, to explore ideas for making cryptocurrency more useful for people in distressed economic climates like Venezuela.“Access to products is the number one thing,” Machado said of the needs of everyday Venezuelans. “Do I have enough to eat this week or do I need to reinvent the ways that I access food?”So far, better-off Venezeulans have mainly used bitcoin for remittances, freelance earnings from abroad and savings. Meanwhile, users of other cryptocurrencies, like dash, often rely on local ambassadors for fiat liquidity.In order to gain more insight into diverse demographics, OMI co-founder Jamaal Montasser hired Venezuelan recruiters to gather more than 40 participants for studies exploring how people use money in times of political and social upheaval.One such refugee, currently living in Colombia, told OMI the Venezuelan national guard would beat him if he didn’t sell coffee for the government-sanctioned price in bolivars. Another Venezuelan, who now crosses the Colombian border regularly to find work, smuggles back American dollars in her underwear and hair.In such circumstances, a digital currency would seem ideal. But OMI’s research found such users have habits and circumstances that current bitcoin wallets don’t account for.“The things that people wanted to buy, they couldn’t buy with bitcoin,” OMI co-founder Jill Carlson told CoinDesk. “You could find merchants willing to accept bitcoin for more high-end goods, but not for more basic or staple goods. You can’t go buy bread with bitcoin in Caracas.”Montasser said in many Venezuelan stores that do accept cryptocurrency there might only be one particular person who knows how to operate digital wallets. So shoppers need to sync up with that person’s schedule. Indeed, mobile wallets are one of the underlying challenges for bitcoin users in Venezuela because it is common for Venezuelans to pool their money and even share one bitcoin wallet with family or friends.“There’s certainly some type of case to be made for family banking tools,” Montasser said. “What we saw in the field was people need systems and products and tools to help elevate trust with the people that they already interact with.”This supports what Human Rights Foundation (HRF) chief strategy officer Alex Gladstein told CoinDesk about research he is conducting with bitcoin users in Iran, India, and Nigeria.“Both with remittances and commerce, people are using bitcoin as a bridge between two different monies,” Gladstein said of users that leverage bitcoin to access fiat when they need it.HRF is one of several organizations that support OMI so far. Others include the Zcash Foundation, IDEO, Cosmos, Tezos, Stellar and GiveCrypto.To be clear, these organizations, and independent backer Zooko Wilcox of the Electronic Coin Company, all donate to the nonprofit OMI for independent research and insights beyond cryptocurrency.“It is nice to have an autonomous organization, especially when it comes to showing up somewhere without an agenda,” Gladstein said of getting a better understanding of how people are using money.Wilcox agreed, saying protocol-agnostic insights are crucial for crypto companies because it’s still unclear if or how cryptocurrencies could be useful in distressed markets like Venezuela.“It’s really important to connect the technological ideas, the product ideas, even the economic theories that we come up with to real people’s lives,” he said.As such, the OMI team said they are now sharing their research with companies seeking specific product and feature ideas that suit the needs of economically distressed and politically censored populations.“It looks like in this case, with bitcoin in particular, the LocalBitcoins platform became a vital way for Venezuelans to access the global economy,” Gladstein said.According to OMI’s first research report, LocalBitcoins is the primary on-ramp Venezuelans access, precisely because it is flexible for people to adapt their social networks to a P2P format, with more than 37 billion bolivars – or $7.1 million – worth of transactions in the first week of May, according to Coin.Dance.Speaking to the broader significance of this work, Gladstein concluded:“We at the Human Rights Foundation have noticed how closely tied financial freedom and financial access is to other types of civil liberties.”Venezuelan migrant Joaquín in his crypto-accepting cafe image via OMI"

Taproot is expected to be bundled together with an upgrade called Schnorr in a soft fork that developers have been looking into for some time, paving the way for privacy and scalability improvements to bitcoin.Developers have long been thinking about how to arrange this particular upgrade. There have been a number of proposed changes to bitcoin over the years and, as they are all related, it makes sense to implement them together. That includes Merkelized Abstract Syntax Trees (MAST), adding, improved bitcoin smart contracts, Schnorr signatures, which adds another way to sign bitcoin transactions, and Taproot, which adds even better privacy.This pair of Taproot proposals, available on Github, is one more signal the pieces for such a transition are finally starting to come together.It’s important that these technical details are now public because more developers in the community can look at them and see if they agree with the changes. If the community agrees these changes are the right ones to make, then the change could finally go live after being put together over several years.Notably, some think this will be less controversial than bitcoin’s last soft fork activating Segregated Witness (SegWit). Bitcoin cash developers, those who split off from bitcoin because they didn’t agree with the code change, actually really like Schnorr. In fact, they are implementing similar technology in a little over a week.For a bit more detail, Wuille’s first BIP describes a “new SegWit version 1 output type, with spending rules based on Taproot, Schnorr signatures, and Merkle branches.”The BIP primarily describes the timing and methodology to be used for this next upgrade and will include the popular Taproot and Schnorr upgrades to be rolled out while “not adding any new strong security assumptions and “not combining into the proposal any functionality which could be simply implemented independently,” wrote Wuille.While the second describes “the semantics of the initial scripting system under bip-taproot.”Wuille added in his email announcing the BIPs that while proposal includes Schnorr, MAST, and Taproot, one other much-anticipated feature will probably not make it in this time around:“While many other ideas exist, not everything is incorporated. This includes several ideas that can be implemented separately without loss of effectiveness. One such idea is a way to integrate SIGHASH_NOINPUT, which we’re working on as an independent proposal.”Wuille image via CoinDesk archives"

","Overall, the authors suggest bitcoin ought to be considered a strategic position within long-term investment portfolios considering its transparent, immutable and global liquidity. Bitcoin has a distinct set of properties unlike any other asset, the paper says, which allow it to perform well over the course of normal economic cycles as well as market disruptions. Additionally, noting significant shifts taking place in monetary, fiscal and trade policies around the world, Grayscale alleges politicians and policymakers may find it increasingly difficult to manage their economies – thus insinuating a need for investors to take control of their own finances. The report examined five recent macroeconomic shocks in which the digital asset outperformed other investments as a store of value. The authors extrapolated from these case studies – including Grexit, Brexit, China’s structural devaluation of the renminbi and two Trump shocks – that bitcoin could be a useful tool in helping investors insulate their portfolios from any potential market failures. Below are three exegesis of bitcoin’s inherent ability to hedge against liquidity crises.In the first case study, ‘Grexit and the 3-week Greek bank shutdown,’ which spanned from April to July 2015, Greece underwent a physical liquidity crisis as default of sovereign debt seemed inevitable. In a response to financial uncertainty, the Greek government closed state banks and imposed strict capital controls on transactions, beginning on June 28, 2015. These restrictions remained in place for three weeks, while bailout terms were negotiated with international creditors, which sparked apprehensions about the unchecked power of governments over holders of centralized assets in times of crisis. Yet, “during the liquidity freeze, bitcoin emerged as one of the only means by which to transfer value in or out of Greece, reinforcing this new asset’s ability to return the power of control to the individual who holds it,” write Grayscale analysts. Leading up to the resolution to the Grexit crisis on July 13, 2015, bitcoin saw returns of 28 percent versus an average of -1.7 percent for 20 other markets and currencies.Another case study examined the People’s Bank of China’s structural devaluation of the renminbi, and China’s shift in monetary policy between August 2015 and December 2016. Amid stock market turbulence and concerns over the health of the world’s second largest economy, the Chinese government lowered the RMB-USD reference rate 1.9 percent, signaling a shift to “market-driven” pricing and an attempt to stimulate export driven growth. This policy-shift saw RMB’s largest single day drop in over twenty years, as well as a five-month selloff of global risk assets in favor of wealth preservation assets, according to researchers. Again, Grayscale notes bitcoin fared much better. “Between the day of the announcement and the trough of the drawdown, Bitcoin largely outperformed the following major markets and currencies, producing a cumulative return of 53.6 percent versus an average return of -10.1 percent.” Bitcoin was used to hedge against Chinese liquidity risk, caused by local investors sold their assets against a structural currency devaluation.The shock of the U.K.’s referendum vote to separate from the European Union was followed by a knee-jerk selloff and immediate decline in the pound sterling (GBP) and euro, as the market attempted to digest whether Brexit would portend the disintegration of the European Union. During the first one-day global selloff, the researchers found, “bitcoin was a top performing asset, boasting a return of 7.1 percent on strong volume, versus an average of -2.1 percent for the rest of the group” of currencies. Additionally, the researchers find cause to recommend, because the details of the transition plan still being worked out, global investors might consider allocating a portion of their investable assets to bitcoin to hedge against contagion stemming from the Eurozone, the world’s second largest economy.Read more in the full report. Michael Sonnenshein image via CoinDesk archives "

","The Transaction Amount to Active Addresses Ratio (TAAR), first proposed by CoinDesk Contributor and Valiendero Digital Assets Founder Chris Brookins, divides bitcoin’s 24-hour adjusted transaction volume (USD) by the number of its active addresses to identify how much each active address spends in transactions per day on average. If TAAR is high, then it means each user (active address) is transacting in high notional values, in other words, the network “quantity” (how much is being spent i.e. transaction volume) is high per the “quality” (how many users are spending the funds i.e. active addresses). When the quantity and quality of bitcoin’s network are high, then one would expect a positive reaction in bitcoin’s market and vice versa when the ratio is low. Since April of 2013, the oldest data point available via Coinmetrics, this has proven to be the case as it has been made clear bitcoin’s price only enters sustainable trends when it is accompanied by a TAAR trend in the same direction.As is shown above, bitcoin was only able to escape its bear market in 2015 once its network activity picked up pace, made evident by the TAAR finally failing to set new lows along with bitcoin’s price and beginning to trend upwards (highlighted in the red square). This, in a sense, added fundamental validation to bitcoin’s price growth at the time, which often falls victim to pure speculation. Interestingly, bitcoin’s TAAR is once again clearly rising along with its price in a similar fashion to that seen at the end of the previous bear market, potentially suggesting bitcoin’s latest price growth may be sustainable as long as the network activity continues to rise. Corrections in price should be expected, but according to this model, bulls should only be concerned when TAAR loses significant altitude. Now, the sample size is small spanning just six years, so combining this metric in analysis with other metrics would be fruitful in order to avoid outlier signals, but nonetheless, the TAAR does show an increase in bitcoin’s network activity not seen in several months regardless of its connection to prices.

After all, the cryptocurrency decoupled from equity markets and rallied by nearly $4,000 in May.Even so, the correction is noteworthy as it is accompanied by a sharp rally in gold prices. The yellow metal picked up a bid at $1,275 per Oz on May 30 and climbed to $1,344 per Oz on Wednesday – the highest level since Feb. 20.As seen above, the inverse relationship has been in place since the final quarter of 2018.On Nov. 14, BTC dived below the long-held support of $6,000, reviving the bear market which had come to a halt near that psychological support in five months to October. By mid-December, BTC was trading at 15-month lows near $3,100.During the same time frame, gold went from $1,200 to $1,300 and further extended the rally to $1,346 (Feb. 20 high).However, by early May, gold was roughly down 6 percent from February highs, while BTC was trading at $5,500, representing a 76 percent rise on December lows near $3,100.The inverse correlation weakened somewhat in May with gold trading the range of $1,300-$1,270 amid BTC’s sharp rise to $9,000.The two assets, however, are again moving in opposite directions, as mentioned earlier. It is worth noting that correlation doesn’t imply causation.Gold’s recent rally is likely associated with markets aggressively pulling forward Federal Reserve (Fed) interest rate cut expectations.For instance, the probability that the Fed would cut rates in July rose to 72 percent earlier this week – up significantly from 30 percent seen in early May. Further, the Fed funds futures market is now pricing three rate cuts for this year.It is worth noting that correlation does not imply causation. While gold – a zero-yielding asset – is cheering increased prospects of a drop in US borrowing costs, bitcoin is taking a hit, possibly due to chart-driven factors.That said, the inverse relationship warrants attention and potential toppy price action in gold could be considered an advance warning of a bullish reversal in bitcoin.Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.Bitcoin image via Shutterstock; charts by Trading View"

With every move higher, both the short- and long-term bull cases presented by several technical indicators over the last few weeks have gained strength.BTC, therefore, appears on track to test the 100-week price average, currently at $6,506 – a level that last came into play last November.As of writing, the cryptocurrency is changing hands at $6,260 on Bitstamp, representing a 3.45 percent gain on a 24-hour basis.BTC continues to establish bullish higher highs and higher lows on the daily chart (above left) with key moving averages trending north.The relative strength index (RSI) is reporting overbought conditions with above-70 reading.

As of writing, the bulls are showing no signs of exhaustion.Further, the weekly RSI (above right) is currently printing the strongest bullish signal in over 15 months.On the hourly chart, the RSI has breached the ascending trendline to the downside and is rolling over from overbought levels. Hence, we may see a minor pullback to the ascending trendline support, currently at $6,140, before rising toward $6,500.While bitcoin has doubled in value over the last six weeks, altcoins have underperformed big time, as indicated by the massive depreciation of their BTC-denominated exchange rates.!function(){""use strict"";window.addEventListener(""message"",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[""datawrapper-height""])for(var e in a.data[""datawrapper-height""]){var t=document.getElementById(""datawrapper-chart-""+e)||document.querySelector(""iframe[src*='""+e+""']"");t&&(t.style.height=a.data[""datawrapper-height""][e]+""px"")}})}(); The numbers indicate a lack of interest in altcoins despite BTC’s confirmation of the long-term bullish reversal on April 2.The battered altcoins, however, could soon find some love, as their combined market capitalization seems to have charted a bullish technical pattern.The bull flag seen in the above chart is a continuation pattern that often ends up accelerating the preceding rally.A convincing break above the upper edge of the flag, currently at $73.65 billion, would confirm a flag breakout and signal a continuation of the rise from lows near $45 billion seen in February.A flag breakout, if confirmed, could be considered a sign the much-anticipated altcoin rally has begun. As of writing, the total altcoin market cap is seen at $72 billion.Among the major altcoins, litecoin (LTC) could shine bright, as its mining reward halving is due in less than 90 days.The process aimed at curbing inflation by reducing mining rewards by half every four years tends to put a strong bid under the cryptocurrency for months in advance, according to historical data.Litecoin’s channel breakout indicates the path of least resistance is to the higher side.

However, that move was quickly rejected and an increase in selling pressure on today’s open laid the pathway for bitcoin to slide, first to $5,200 overnight, then quickly to $5,018 soon before press time.At press time, bitcoin is trading at $5,068, down over 3 percent for the session, as per CoinDesk price data.The drop may now have thrown a spanner into a bullish market setup that had looked likely to propel prices to highs not seen since late last year. Had bitcoin’s triangle breakout succeeded, a measured move to $5,800 may have been on the cards. However, bitcoin fell $300 short of that target as buyer volume fell short on the day.With bitcoin taking a hit, the wider crypto market is also flashing red at press time.

look set to produce a bullish crossover – a sign of bull ...","Jun 13, 2019 at 11:00 UTC",A long-term bitcoin (BTC) price indicator is about to turn bullish for the first time in nearly four years.,"The 50-candle moving average (MA) on the three-day chart is trending north and could soon cross above the 100-candle, confirming a bullish crossover – the first since October 2015.A bullish crossover, as the same suggests, is a strong indicator of bull market momentum, according to technical analysis theory.In reality, however, both bullish and bearish crossovers tend to lag prices. After all, the MA studies are based on historical data.Even so, the upcoming bullish crossover warrants attention due to the fact that bitcoin broke into a 2.3-year long uptrend with the bullish crossover of the same averages in 2015.BTC’s bear market ran out of steam at lows near $150 in January 2015, following which the price remained largely trapped in $200-$300 range for nine months before confirming a bearish-to-bullish trend change with a move above the July 12 high of $318 on Oct. 28.Notably, the 50- and 100-candle MAs had produced a bullish crossover on Oct. 16 – twelve days before BTC broke into a bull market.The cryptocurrency then charted a steady stream of bullish higher lows and higher highs over the next two years to reach a record high of $20,000 in December 2017.More importantly, lows near $220 seen ahead of the bull cross haven’t come into play till date.The 50-candle MA could soon find acceptance above the 100-candle MA, confirming a bullish crossover.This time, however, BTC may not immediately see a sharp rally as the cryptocurrency has already gained more than 185 percent in the last six months.The relative strength index (RSI) has rolled over from overbought territory, signaling scope for a price pullback and is currently teasing a downside break of the trendline representing the uptrend from December lows. So, a temporary price pullback could be in the offing.It is worth noting that the picture was somewhat different in 2015 with BTC stuck in a $100 range for nine months to October during which the averages bottomed out.Further, the cryptocurrency was up just 67 percent from the bear market low and the RSI was reporting bullish conditions with an above 50-print when the crossover happened on Oct. 16, 2015. Put simply, BTC had room to rally on confirmation of the bullish crossover.As for the next 24 hours, BTC may remain bid, having ended an eight-day long trading range of $7,500-$8,100 with a bullish breakout on Wednesday.As of writing, the leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization is trading at $8,113 on Bitstamp, representing 1 percent gains on a 24-hour basis.BTC found acceptance above $8,100 in the U.S. trading hours yesterday, confirming twin bullish cues – a falling channel breakout and a sideways channel breakout on the 4-hour chart.As a result, the cryptocurrency has scope for a rally to $8,400. So far, however, the upside is being capped by the 100-candle MA, currently at $8,188.The case for a rise to $8,400 would weaken if the repeated rejection at the 100-candle MA ends up sending prices below the ascending trendline support, currently at $7,910.Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.Bitcoin image via CoinDesk archives; charts by Trading View"

mine using computers.” Without spending too much time on this ...","Apr 6, 2019 at 09:00 UTC","UPDATE (9, April 00:09 UTC): Oliver von Landsberg-Sadie, CEO of BCB Group was given a right of reply to defend his statements regarding his findings as cited by Reuters.","———Mainstream news coverage of cryptocurrency is often disingenuous or factually incorrect – that’s certainly no surprise given the nascent technology is widely misunderstood.But if one would have thought that recent milestones – bitcoin’s 10th anniversary, the arrival of crypto projects from the likes of JP Morgan and Facebook – would have encouraged the media to get smarter, this week’s news shows attitudes at major publishers haven’t changed much. This is especially true during times of heavy market activity like that of bitcoin’s April 2 breakout, which saw its price rise 17 percent over a 30-minute period.As CoinDesk readers know, the move was foreshadowed by changes in market data and sentiment. With volatility hitting multi-year lows, multiple technical indicators flashings signs of a bottom and fundamental catalysts (the upcoming halving) combining, there were plenty of developments that signaled a change might be on its way. Still, far from examining developments (or asking serious questions), much of the mainstream media’s coverage devolved into outright theory and speculation. Here’s the worst of what was a genuinely bad bunch. While articles like these from Gizmodo are useful in gauging retail sentiment – ie, determining where the average Joe sits in terms of understanding and valuing cryptocurrency – they, unfortunately aren’t useful for anyone who wants to be informed.Writers like Matt Novak have a point – novice retail investors were given a bitter taste in 2018, when the market for cryptocurrencies took a turn for the worse. Still, that’s no excuse for not educating yourself or your readers, who, without such learning, may repeat mistakes. The article reads:“To be clear, bitcoin is absolutely worthless by any real measure. It’s fake money that’s about as practical to use in the real world as Monopoly bills. Bitcoin is backed by nothing and requires tremendous amounts of energy to mine using computers.”Without spending too much time on this statement, there are a few incorrect passages, that in particular, don’t ring true. For one, bitcoin definitely can act as a medium of exchange. It can be, and today is used to facilitate the commerce and trade of goods between parties, a core fundamental function of modern money. Next, it’s backed by the computer operators that mine the network itself, all of whom invest real dollars, manpower and equipment in ensuring the network is functional. Finally, while the cost of mining bitcoin remains high thanks to its large energy consumption, this does not mean it cannot run off renewable energy and take advantage of natural events that reduce the cost and lessen the impact to the environment. It seems mainstream media tends to forget that the cost of mining bitcoin’s physical competitor, gold, is perhaps even more guilty of harming the earth’s environment as its miners regularly tear apart massive landscapes and leave behind loads of toxic waste.To state that this will forever be bitcoin’s final form borders on ignorance as well, as we have seen time and time again that the evolution of technologies usually comes from a solution to fix a specific problem.One of the least offensive of the bunch, a Reuter’s report that cited a solo “mystery” buy order as the main cause for a huge price spike still offered a confused take by focusing in on a sole market irregularity. In particular, it highlights a claim made by the chief executive of cryptocurrency firm BCB Group, Oliver von Landsberg-Sadie, who argued the case that the move was the responsibility of a single buyer.The article reads:“Today’s gain (April 2) was probably triggered by an order worth about $100 million spread across U.S.-based exchanges Coinbase and Kraken and Luxembourg’s Bitstamp. There has been a single order that has been algorithmically-managed across these three venues, of around 20,000 BTC.”This is hard to corroborate with independent analysis as the article did not provide evidence of the orders, merely statements that negate other factors.  As the price climbed higher, this resulted in a snowball effect of buying as shorts were closed and limit buy orders were triggered, causing its price to rise faster and higher. Using an hourly view of bitcoin’s price we can see just how much volume was recorded during a single trading period by looking at the volume bars and order books and then noting their readings. At 4:00 UTC on April 2, Coinbase recorded a total of 6,889 units in a single hour and Bitstamp handled close to 3,798 units while Kraken had the least at 4,121 bitcoin units traded in the same hour.This created a total of 14,808 units traded in the hour of the surge, yet Reuters and CNBC claimed 7,000 units were purchased on each of the three different exchanges in tandem by a single entity at the time of the surge.Needless to say at the time the numbers didn’t quite add up.Also of note, data shows that growing buy volume began to increase substantially across most major exchanges, not just the three highlighted in the article.However, Oliver reached out to Coindesk in order to support his claim by providing the following:"

He contended in court that bitcoin should be treated as a foreign currency and not be taxed.The Tax Authority, on the other hand, argued that bitcoin is not a currency but an asset, and therefore profits should be liable to CGT.The presiding judge, Shmuel Bornstein, made the point in his arguments that bitcoin as a cryptocurrency could cease to exist and be replaced by another digital currency. Hence, it cannot be considered a currency, especially for tax purposes.As a result of the ruling, Copel is now liable for tax of around 3 million NIS ($830,600) as well as costs of 30,000 NIS ($8,306), according to the report. However, Copel can yet appeal to the Supreme Court for a reversal of the decision.With its ruling, the court has sided with the Israeli government’s position that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are considered property for tax purposes. In February 2018, the Tax Authority issued a notice, saying that profits from cryptocurrencies will be subject to CGT at rates from 20–25 percent.On the other hand, individuals mining or trading cryptocurrencies in connection with businesses, are liable to a 17 percent value-added tax in addition to capital gains tax.Israeli shekels and bitcoin image via Shutterstock"

Users reported encountering problems in posting new trades and updating previous ones on the website.“If you have an account already, you will be able to withdraw your bitcoins, but you will not be able to use the platform for trading,” reads a response by LocalBitcoins to an Iranian user that has circulated in social media and local news websites.A message also appeared on the platform’s Iran country page that read: “Unfortunately, LocalBitcoins is currently not available in your selected region.” On Twitter, the exchange told several Iranian users: “Our services are not available in your region for risk-based reasons.”LocalBitcoins has been perhaps the most popular bitcoin trading website among Iranian users, as it doesn’t require international credit card information – something Iranians have been bereft of for decades – and allows users to pay with their local bank accounts.According to Iranian users, the website was also open to reviewing local bank account documents to resolve potential problems, signaling that they have advisors familiar with the largely isolated Iranian banking system.Moreover, LocalBitcoins was trusted by Iran-based bitcoin users because it holds funds in escrow until both sides have given final confirmation, thereby ensuring transaction safety and lowering fraud.“Since I traded in relatively high volumes, LocalBitcoins was my best option because I could find good offers with real people,” bitcoin trader Soroush Hakimi told CoinDesk.He continued:“In local exchanges, rates are unfavorable in many instances while total volume of assets is low. For instance, you can barely find two bitcoins for sale in any given day.”LocalBitcoins did not respond to several requests for comments by CoinDesk on the reasons behind its decision to ban Iranians. But almost undoubtedly, the escalating “maximum pressure” campaign of the U.S. against Iran has prompted the Finnish website to block Iranian users.Just over a year ago, U.S. President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew from Iran’s nuclear deal with world powers, announcing reimposition of new rounds of stringent economic sanctions.Legitimate Iranian crypto users have already felt the sting of sanctions several times during the past year as multiple exchanges, including Binance, Bittrex and ShapeShift have stopped offering services.According to Milad Jahandar, CEO of Iranian fintech Bahamta, the elimination of Localbitcoins as one of the few remaining viable options for Iranian bitcoiners will lead to more fraud in cryptocurrency-related commerce.“Users will be forced to resort to person-to-person transactions and trusting each other, which increases risks of fraud, sets back the local community, and delays bitcoin prevalence,” he told CoinDesk.Jahandar also believes that excluding users from any country due to political reasons runs counter to the very decentralized nature of bitcoin.“Bitcoin is a global network that knows no borders, colors or ethnicities,” he said. “So when an exchange bans Iranian users, it is basically downgrading its applications to that of fiat currencies.”Still, local Iranians seeking to buy and sell cryptocurrency are not without options. The restrictions are increasingly pushing Iranians toward truly decentralized exchanges that won’t discriminate based on nationality.Programmer Ziya Sadr says two alternatives to Localbitcoins have already proven to be better and are attracting Iranian users. The first is Bisq, he said, an open-source decentralized peer-to-peer application that runs on Tor, and has recently integrated Farsi for Iranian users.“Bisq doesn’t require you to do KYC and all deals run either privately or anonymously,” Sadr told CoinDesk in reference to know-your-customer identification protocols. “This makes it perfect for Iranian users who are always censored or blocked.”He also referred to Hodl Hodl as another option, which is similar to Localbitcoins but has also recently added a Farsi interface for Iranian users.“This seems to be a way for the founders of Hodl Hodl to welcome Iranian users to their website,” Sadr said.Lastly, some Iranian users have also turned to the KeepChange peer-to-peer exchange, which in the wake of the LocalBitcoins ban sought to reassure possible users that it remains loyal to the bitcoin philosophy of preventing government interference and resisting censorship.“Iranian users, as well as any other nationalities anywhere in the world, can use KeepChange for buying and selling bitcoin without worrying of any kind of censorship, sanctions, money seizures, etc.,” the exchange told an Iranian website on May 19.Iran image via Shutterstock"

The addition of bitcoin payouts gives miners more incentive to try the $799 ($699 with a special BTC discount) product.“To get you the most bitcoin possible from your Coinmine One, we had to engineer MineOS to automatically mine whatever crypto converts to bitcoin at the highest rate and then exchange it to Bitcoin for you and put it in your wallet,” said founder Farbood Nivi. “This way you’re getting way more Bitcoin than if the device was mining Bitcoin directly. ”The Coinmine box won’t make you a millionaire overnight. Nivi sees it as a testbed and experimental tool for those who want to dip a toe into the mining process. Given the resource requirements of high-stakes mining, however, the Coinmine offers users a less energy-intensive option.“At today’s numbers, your Coinmine One will generate about $15-20/month of bitcoin in USD prices,” said Nivi. “Of course, that number changes based on the future value of Bitcoin. If the value of Bitcoin appreciates, so will the value of what you made with your Coinmine One.”Nivi also sees the product as a cheaper and faster way to take part in networks like Lightning.“The time to build and maintain a comparable device with mining and a Bitcoin Lighting Node is about $400 if your time is worth $20/hour and it takes you 20 hours to research and build the hardware and software,” he said. “The parts for a miner and a Bitcoin Lightning Node could cost you $500 easily. That’s $900, and you still would have to control your DIY device from a command line with a monitor and keyboard instead of an app you can just tap on.”Coinmine is rolling out the BTC update today and users will be able to mine and even “put their crypto to work,” said Nivi.“We’re also partnering with services like Compound Finance, Cred, and Blockfi so you can put your crypto to work and earn a return on the crypto that your Coinmine makes.

As the price of bitcoin goes up, so does ...","Apr 13, 2019 at 09:00 UTC",Noelle Acheson is a veteran of company analysis and member of CoinDesk’s product team.,"The following article originally appeared in Institutional Crypto by CoinDesk, a newsletter for the institutional market, with news and views on crypto infrastructure delivered every Tuesday. Sign up at the link below.The rally last week in cryptocurrency prices sent tremors of excitement through the mainstream press – is bitcoin “doing its thing” again? Could we be on the verge of a breakout?These reports attract clicks and eyeballs, so I understand why they are run – but their breathless fascination with price volatility and potential profits misses the bigger impact.While we can generally agree that investment gains are good, the broader benefit is this: cryptocurrency price increases throw into starker relief the uniqueness of the asset class.(To avoid over-complicating the discussion, in this article I’ll focus on bitcoin – but the same or similar arguments can also be applied to other cryptocurrencies, depending on their characteristics.)First, let’s compare bitcoin to other commodities.In practically all other instances, a price increase affects supply. When gold or oil go up in price, there is an incentive to extract even more from the ground. Previously unprofitable mines or wells become profitable, and those that were to begin with become more so. Operators will logically seek to maximize the opportunity by producing what they can while prices are good, and supply goes up.As supply goes up, however, demand generally comes down as consumption budgets are reallocated and substitutes are sought. As demand comes down, the price comes down again, which lowers the incentive to produce, which eventually lowers supply. And so on and so on.Comparing bitcoin to fiat currencies displays a similar dynamic. An increase in demand for a currency relative to another one will eventually make goods denominated in that currency expensive compared to alternatives denominated in different ones.With bitcoin, the price does not affect supply. At all. An increase in demand will lead to an increase in price which – without the “correcting mechanism” of a potential increase in supply and/or reallocation of demand – could continue indefinitely.However, all markets need self-correcting mechanisms. One of bitcoin’s is transaction fees – a sharp increase in demand will most likely boost the fees the miners can charge when processing transactions, which could dampen the upswing in volumes.This highlights the second significant differentiating factor, which is bitcoin’s ingenious incentive scheme. As the price goes up, the network becomes more secure.Miners process blocks of transactions and, in compensation, are rewarded with a set number of bitcoins. As the price of bitcoin goes up, so does the value of the reward. More miners will be attracted by the potential profits from both the earned bitcoin and transaction fees. A greater number of miners results in better distributed network maintenance, which enhances the cryptocurrency’s resistance to bad actors.This, in turn, should bolster confidence and demand, which should both increase the price and the network’s resilience even further.This does not mean that a price bump will continue into the stratosphere indefinitely.External factors such as regulation, the emergence of alternatives or even macroeconomic mood could have a significant dampening effect on demand. Internal factors such as forks and governance debates could also have an impact.But one of the overlooked features of bitcoin is that, all other things being equal, it does not have a fundamental self-correcting mechanism like most other assets. Not only will a price increase not trigger a supply/demand rebalancing, it actually enhances the network’s strength and potential demand.“All other things” are rarely equal, however. Sentiment plays a powerful role in all markets, but especially in one such as bitcoin where widely accepted valuation methods don’t yet exist. As we saw in 2017-18, the “reflexivity” (in which perceptions affect the market which affects perceptions) that pushed the market up can bring it back down fast.This, in a sense, is bitcoin’s main self-correcting mechanism: market skittishness. Given the relatively low liquidity and overall lack of transparency, traders and investors seem to follow the well-worn principle: “If you must panic, panic first.”Yet even this is likely to be mitigated over time.The crypto winter was not just about the building of a more robust (and regulated) market infrastructure; it was also about the education of institutional investors, who will no doubt bring more sophisticated trading strategies to the market.While many institutions will probably take positions with a long-term view, we won’t be hearing them cry “To the moon!” There will come a time when their strategy indicates a lock-in of profits, and even a hint of volume selling could be enough to trigger a sharp correction.But the same level of sophistication will also set floors for any correction, and as volumes grow, infrastructure continues to improve and valuation techniques develop, volatility will smooth as will the tendency for large market participants to react blindly to perceived shifts.With this, the cryptocurrency’s fundamental characteristics will increasingly predominate investment decisions. And bitcoin and its peers will continue to show us that cryptocurrencies are, indeed, a different type of asset class.Interested in receiving a weekly email with updates on market infrastructure, regulation and institutional crypto products?

Prior to launch, 500 people, from Saudi Arabia to India, tested the service, according to CEO Mohamed Abdou. Since going live on Saturday, 151 emails have been sent between Dmail’s 600 users.With limited access to cryptocurrency exchanges being a common theme in the Middle East especially, Abdou said the ability to receive or send bitcoin directly to the Blockstack ID’s external cryptocurrency wallet could become a key feature in attracting users to this messaging service.“There is social information, and payment information, already attached to the message,” Abdou said. “Especially in Egypt, I’m trying to do my best to spread the culture of privacy.”Bitcoiners living in Egypt often struggle to acquire cryptocurrency, since electricity for mining is expensive and services like exchanges generally exclude this jurisdiction. The Egyptian government has condemned both trading and commercial usage of bitcoin.“This is also associated with human rights because you have the right to communicate with others in a private and secure way,” Abdou told CoinDesk. “Bitcoin could be useful to software developers who are freelancing all over the world.”Indeed, Blockstack investor and Dmail advisor Mohamed Elkasstawi, founding partner at Zk Capital, told CoinDesk the high level of unemployment among Egyptians could be seen as an opportunity for global companies in the blockchain space. Speaking of blockchain use cases more broadly, Elkasstawi said:“Adoption will come from emerging markets where trust [in traditional systems] is low.”Dmail uses Blockstack decentralized identities (DIDs), which can be linked to GitHub and social profiles, as well as cryptocurrency addresses, in a way that the user controls.The service is currently listed in Blockstack’s App Mining program, which distributes bitcoin grants to projects garnering the most usage and developer contributions.There’s clearly a demand for secure email services, as the current market leader, ProtonMail, reportedly has 10 million users.Dmail messages are encrypted. And, with Blockstack’s storage system, only the DID holder herself has access to any related data. Plus, recipients must indicate their consent in order to receive a message from another ID holder. Recipients can still deactivate the ability for that sender to send new messages at any time.Speaking to the potential of this free Dmail service, Blockstack’s head of growth Patrick Stanley added:“They seem to be a highly motivated team, and developers like them throughout Egypt need better access to funding to build great apps that protect people.”Mohamed Abdou image via Intelli Coders"

of “blocks ...","May 19, 2019 at 09:15 UTC","“I’m interested in blockchain, not bitcoin.”","Admit it, you’ve heard this hundreds, if not thousands, of times. (You might have even said it yourself.) And sure, people know what you’re saying, you’re talking about the “technology underlying bitcoin” and you sound smart enough.Once it became known – or at least presumed – that you could apply cryptography in finance, in ways similar to how it’s used in bitcoin, everyone started making sure that statement fell from their lips. And that refrain – kicked off by bitcoin itself – remains powerful today.Sounds plausible? Sure. But, interestingly, the word “blockchain” doesn’t actually appear in the original bitcoin white paper, released back in 2008. Rather, the white paper uses the words “block” and “chain” separately many times.It describes the word “block” as the vehicle for a bundle bitcoin transactions. Then, these blocks of are linked together, forming a “chain” of “blocks.”So, who created this ultimate industry buzzword?Turns out, the origins of the word are not quite so revolutionary.“The word blockchain was never used in the early days,” former bitcoin developer Mike Hearn told CoinDesk. Although, Hearn did acknowledge that Satoshi often referred to bitcoin’s “proof-of-work chain” in discussions on forums.It seems the first references to the word came about on Bitcoin Talk, a bitcoin-specific forum created by Satoshi, in July 2010 – more than a year after bitcoin’s release.And at that time, these remarks weren’t about how innovative the technology was, but instead were complaints about how long it took to download the bitcoin “blockchain” (the entire history of bitcoin transactions).While compared to today, the download would have far faster, according to one Bitcoin Talk user: “The initial blockchain download is quite slow.”In other words, initially, blockchain was far from the sexy word it is today.It’s hard to pinpoint exactly when the word really took hold.But interest in the term seems to have sprung out of professional organizations and individuals hesitance to align themselves with bitcoin itself because of its bad reputation as the currency for drugs and gray economies.“I think it [became popular] around the time people started going to Washington [D.C.] and trying to make bitcoin respectable by divorcing the currency from the underlying algorithms,” Hearn said.To many, bitcoin the currency could be decoupled from bitcoin the blockchain protocol, and so a whole new industry of so-called “private blockchains,” devoid of a cryptocurrency, emerged. Sure enough, around that time in 2015, Google Trends data show the term surged.“Initially people said ‘block chain’, and then, thanks to a great PR campaign, we were blessed with the much improved ‘blockchain,’ single-word, probably thanks to a community-wide effort near and around the Bitcoin Talk forums,” long-time cryptocurrency developer Greg Slepak said.Not only did it become one word, but it also came in vogue to describe any blockchain that wasn’t bitcoin’s blockchain as “a blockchain.” Bitcoin got to keep the terminology “the blockchain,” giving credence to the fact that it was the first.Yet blockchain has become so divorced from bitcoin that both words typically see a similar spike when cryptocurrency prices start mooning. For instance, the word blockchain saw a huge uptick in Google searches in late 2017.Still, it’s unclear exactly where the idea itself begins. To some, blockchains existed even before bitcoin, although that term wasn’t applied to them back then.For instance, cryptographer Stuart Haber, whose whitepapers on timestamping were cited in the bitcoin white paper, claims to have created the first blockchain called Surety.According to Haber, that has to be the reason why Satoshi cited his work – three times out of just nine total citations. Surety was launched in 1995 for timestamping records, and it’s still running today.Yet, Haber admits that his version doesn’t have all the same benefits of bitcoin since it’s centralized – managed by one company.And that highlights where things get tricky when you’re talking about a blockchain. See, there isn’t necessarily agreement on a single definition of a the technology.The Merriam Webster dictionary actually presents a much older word for blockchain – “a chain in which the alternate links are broad blocks connected by thin side links pivoted to the ends of the blocks, used with sprocket wheels to transmit power, as in a bicycle.”While Google defines blockchain as:But, for those seasoned veterans of the space, even this definition is problematic. Many of these new-age private blockchains don’t record their transactions publicly.“The term has become so widespread that it’s quickly losing meaning,” as The Verge put it earlier this year.Haber pointed to an Indian parable to help explain the incompatible descriptions.In the parable, a group of blind men come upon an elephant and start touching the animal to try and figure it out what it was in front of them.Depending on what part of the elephant each man is touching, their answer changes. For instance, one of the blind men, touching the elephant’s trunk, thinks it’s a snake, while the other, touching the elephant’s leg, exclaims it’s a tree trunk.It’s similar when people define blockchain, Haber said.He told CoinDesk:“Some definitions will be completely silly, showing that people don’t understand what they’re doing, but there will also be a bunch of accurate descriptions of various parts of the vast body of work.”As such, he argues there isn’t just one meaning.Even though, bitcoiners believe a blockchain can only be the one and only bitcoin blockchain, like words, definitions are always evolving and changing.Blockchain shirt image via CoinDesk archives"

Before this lightning feature, roughly 250 beta users already used Moon to spend crypto on e-commerce sites by connecting the browser extension to exchange accounts like Coinbase.Moon CEO Ken Kruger told CoinDesk:“[The extension] will pop up a QR code and it will have the lightning invoice, which you could also copy and paste if you can’t use the QR code for some reason, and you’ll be able to pay with your favorite lightning wallet.”To be clear, Amazon itself never touches bitcoin. Kruger declined to specify which traditional financial institutions are helping convert the bitcoin to fiat on the backend so that Amazon merchants actually receive fiat currency for their wares. However, Kruger added that by 2020 the lightning-enabled feature should work on almost any e-commerce site, regardless of whether that platform accepts bitcoin directly.“There’s no direct merchant integration,” Kruger said, clarifying that Moon also manages payment channels and merely offers a simple interface for sending payments.“We’re integrating with the Visa and Mastercard networks and we get a cut of the interchange fees that merchants pay every time they receive a credit card transaction,” he said.Moon was founded in New York last year and grew to a staff of three people with just $100,000 invested by the Entrepreneurs Roundtable Accelerator. The accelerator’s managing director, Murat Aktihanoglu, told CoinDesk he sees Moon as one of the “anchor” crypto businesses with lucrative potential over the next five years.“We invested in Moon as a long-term portfolio company,” Aktihanoglu said.In the meantime, Kruger said his startup is looking to raise a Series A in 2019 and continue learning from user behavior.“There’s a lot of opportunities to help solve some of those usability problems and getting people onto the lightning network, increasing adoption in that way,” Kruger said. “We’re going to engage with other folks in the lightning community to see what people are doing, what they’re working on and if there are any significant gaps. We’d love to step in and help whenever possible.”UPDATE (April 22, 14:10 UTC): The extension’s lightning network functionality is still being reviewed by the Chrome Web Store and is now anticipated to launch on Wednesday, according to Moon.Moon team image courtesy of the company: (from left) Kemel McKenzie, Ken Kruger and Khurram Kalim"

For instance, on Coinbase and Gemini, the price is around $5,650, while on Bitfinex it is around $5,985.In its methodology description on its website, CoinMarketCap states the conditions for such exclusions saying:“The price of any cryptocurrency is a volume weighted average of market pair prices (1) for the cryptocurrency. … Some prices are manually excluded from the average, denoted by an asterisk (*) on the markets tab if the price does not seem indicative of a free market price; for example, when an exchange disables withdrawals or deposits, or regulatory conditions make it impossible for anyone else outside of a certain geographical region to buy coins. Some prices are also automatically excluded when our algorithms detect that the reported price is a significant outlier when compared to other market pairs for the same cryptocurrency, denoted by three asterisks (***) on the markets tab.”The exclusion from CoinMarketCap’s calculations comes as Bitfinex continues to be mired in controversy. Late last month, the New York attorney general alleged that the exchange, which shares management and owners with stablecoin issuer Tether, lost $850 million of corporate and client funds and subsequently used a loan from Tether’s reserves to secretly cover the shortfall.Bitfinex later claimed that the funds had been “seized” by various authorities and that it was working to retrieve the funds.Bitfinex has now launched what’s termed an initial exchange offering (IEO) to raise as much as $1 billion through a token sale. Though an official white paper for the offering is not yet out, Bitfinex shareholder Dong Zhao has already started taking pre-orders from users who want to participate in the sale.Last January, Bitfinex and Tether were subpoenaed by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, although the regulator did not publicly state why.CoinMarketCap previously changed the way it used data from Bitfinex in response to a report by CoinDesk that pointed out that a trading pair shown on CoinMarketCap – apparently for trades between the tether stablecoin (USDT) and U.S. dollars – did not, in fact, represent a pair available for trading on Bitfinex. In response, CoinMarketCap said it was excluding that pair from its volume data.The data provider also formed a new alliance last week, called the Data Accountability & Transparency Alliance (DATA), with Bitfinex and other exchanges on board, in order to tackle concerns over cryptocurrency data reporting.Bitcoin and Bitfinex image via Shutterstock; Screenshots via CoinMarketCap and TradingView"

But why?,"To those who have been paying attention to the charts, it shouldn’t come as a surprise. The leading cryptocurrency by market value jumped nearly $1,000 to $5,080 in a 60-minute window early on Tuesday, confirming a transition from bear market to bull market that it had been signaling for some time.In fact, after a year-long bear market, savvy traders were waiting on a trend change that would gain credence if and when prices established the most basic of all bullish technical patterns – a higher low and a higher high on its weekly charts. (A higher high would have been confirmed above $4,236.)Looking back, a big move was overdue, as bitcoin’s average daily trading range had slipped to two-year lows in March. An extended period of low volatility often ends up with a violent move on either side.That low volatility period ended with a strong bullish breakout, possibly due to the following three reasons:As mentioned, bitcoin’s charts have been signaling for some time that a bottom may be in the market.This first began in late February, when we reported that bitcoin’s 50-week moving average dropped below the 100-week moving average, confirming a bearish crossover – the first since April 2015.Long-Term Bitcoin Price Indicator Turns Bearish, Suggesting Bottom May Be InAt the time, we wrote that the lagging indicator had turned bearish for the first time in four years, suggesting bitcoin’s price may have bottomed out after a year of declining prices.We wrote:Put simply, it takes a great effort on the part of the bears to push the 50-week MA below the 100-week MA. As a result, the bear market is usually exhausted by the time the crossover is confirmed, which seems to be the case with BTC.That, however, was just the beginning. Several longer duration indicators, like the weekly money flow index (MFI) and the moving average convergence divergence (MACD), would add evidence to the trend.On March 4, the MFI bottomed, contradicting the lower low in bitcoin’s price.That bullish divergence is widely considered an early warning of a bearish-to-bullish trend reversal, a fact we noted at the time. A rising MFI indicates an increase in buying pressure, while a falling MFI is considered a sign of increasing selling pressuresAnother Bitcoin Indicator Signals Price Bottom May Be FormingThe same day, the MACD, a momentum oscillator calculated by subtracting the longer-term moving average from the shorter-term moving average, also turned bullish, a fact no doubt noticed by traders.Yet, these technical developments likely reinforced expectations of a stronger rally ahead of the incoming halving, a scheduled, programmatic reduction in the amount of new bitcoin paid to miners.Bitcoin is set to undergo a mining reward halving in May 2020 and historical data indicates the process tends to put a bid under the cryptocurrency at least a year in advance. (The protocol automatically reduces new issuance after a certain number of blocks are processed, an event that occurred most recently in 2016).What is the ‘Halving’? A Primer to Bitcoin’s Big Mining ChangeMarkets first took note of this possibility in December 2018 after the sell-off ran out of steam near $3,100.The particular price pattern was reminiscent of how the previous bear market had ended at lows near $150 in early January 2015 – 17 months before a reward halving in August 2016.Indeed, historical data shows that bitcoin traders generally respond to the halving, and that the event serves as a signal and potential catalyst.The narrative that BTC is set to repeat history by breaking into a bull market at least a year ahead of the next mining reward halving (due August 2020) has only strengthened over the last three months, possibly leading to the bull breakout yesterday.Indeed, analysts had been arguing for months that with the next bitcoin halving expected to happen in May 2020, the time had come for investors to start paying attention to this pattern.Bitcoin’s Next Halving Rally: Coming Soon in 2019One can’t rule out market irregularities, though, and there appear to have been some yesterday.Reuters reported Tuesday that a single algorithmically managed order worth $100 million spread across several major exchanges – Coinbase and Kraken and Bitstamp – triggered the sudden rally to multi-month highs.Meanwhile, Bitfinex data indicates that the unwinding of bearish bets created upward pressure on prices.BTC/USD short positions plunged from 20,654 BTC to 17,103 BTC between 04:00 and 06:00 UTC yesterday; later declining further to 16,978 BTC – the lowest level since March 2018.Looking forward, BTC could witness a minor pullback to levels below $4,700 in the short-term. The overall outlook, however, will remain bullish as long as BTC remains above $4,236.BTC revisited yesterday’s high of $5,080 earlier today. The bullish move, however, was accompanied by a lower high on the relative strength index (RSI).That bearish divergence indicates scope for a pullback to the ascending (bullish) 50-hour MA, currently at $4,572.But both the triangle breakout and the bullish higher high above $4,236 indicate the tide has turned in favor of the bulls. Validating that argument are the ascending 5- and 10-week moving averages.That said, with the short duration charts reporting overbought conditions, a break above the crucial 21-month exponential moving average (EMA), currently at $5,200, may not happen in the next few days.Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.Bitcoin image via Shutterstock; charts by Trading View"

Trades may be executed at $0.01 per bitcoin, with a listing cycle that can last for as long as 12 months (for the monthly contract) or 70 consecutive eligible contract dates (for the daily contract).Final settlement for both contracts will be at the Bakkt Warehouse.Stepping back, ICE announced last year that it would be launching physically-settled bitcoin futures contracts. Unlike cash-settled contracts, such as what CME Group offers, customers receive an actual bitcoin on the contract’s expiration, and not the fiat equivalent to bitcoin’s price.On Thursday, White wrote that Bakkt’s mission is “ to support the development of trusted infrastructure for securely transacting in the new market for digital assets.”The exchange initially announced potential launch dates last year and January of this year, though both were delayed due to a lack of regulatory approvals. The delay appears to stem in part from Bakkt’s plan to warehouse its own bitcoin and clear trades through the ICE clearinghouse.Bakkt has not yet announced a final launch date.The company first revealed last month it was self-certifying its futures contracts, which included a daily contract that was previously announced and a monthly contract that was not.“This is no small step,” White wrote Thursday. “This launch will usher in a new standard for accessing crypto markets.”He added:“Compared to other markets, institutional participation in crypto remains constrained due to limitations like market infrastructure and regulatory certainty. This results in lower trading volumes, liquidity, and price transparency than more established markets like ICE’s Brent Crude futures contract, which has earned global trust in setting the world’s price of crude oil.”Adam White image via CoinDesk archives"

Another feature makes it difficult to trace the provenance of someone’s bitcoin. The company earns a small fee, in bitcoin, from users that make use of these services.Samourai also provides a privacy-enhancing service called “stonewall” for free. Stonewall creates doubt about the ownership of bitcoin in a given transaction. The company is also offering a forthcoming hardware product, called Dojo, which is a user-friendly bitcoin node built to work with the wallet.Still an alpha release in the works since 2015, Samourai has 27,000 users, according to the company. Its first full version should come out in June. Rodriguez said it will use the funding to expand its development, customer service and quality assurance program, all of which have been put under significant pressure by the wallet’s growth.The products have personally impressed John Carvalho, a longtime bitcoin user who currently works at Bitrefill. Carvalho told CoinDesk:“I have respect for any company that adds utility for Bitcoiners and Samourai is clearly willing to go against the grain to add privacy options for users. If Bitcoin is freedom money, Samourai are freedom fighters.”A similar sentiment spurred the investment itself. Cypherpunk, a venture fund listed on the Canadian Securities Exchange under the ticker symbol HODL, was set up as an investment vehicle to support privacy-enhancing technology.Cypherpunk’s chief investment officer, Moe Adham, said in a press release, “Katana’s technologies will advance the bitcoin project. Privacy is an increasingly important, yet underfunded sector of the market, and it is increasingly coming under attack.”Cypherpunk’s director, Dominic Frisby, told CoinDesk that his fund is looking across a wide array of blockchain technologies for opportunities to undermine global surveillance.“Bitcoin itself scores badly on privacy, but it scores highly on market cap and usage. What bitcoin has that no other coin does is this colossal network effect. That is a powerful thing,” Frisby told CoinDesk.But the fund is not limiting itself strictly to bitcoin. Frisby said:“We’re investing on both sides – in privacy coins themselves and in bitcoin privacy tech. We think there will be growing demand for both.”Katana sword image via Shutterstock"

With version 0.7 of the LND software release coming at an undisclosed date in June, Lightning Labs is launching the most complete build of a network watchtower to date.When someone uses lightning, it’s necessary for someone using it to remain online to make sure their “counterparty” isn’t trying to steal those funds. But this is obviously a UX nightmare; for example, customers don’t have to monitor their Wells Fargo accounts every day to ensure that they’re not being defrauded.The watchtower “watches” for old “states” to be broadcast. In other words, if a bad actor tries to broadcast an old transaction – giving themselves extra money – the watchtower responds by punishing that bad actor.Thus, watchtowers outsource this anti-fraud functionality so users don’t have to do perform this kind of monitoring themselves.Lightning Labs head of cryptographic engineering Conner Fromknecht has been the driving force behind this implementation, even giving a talk on the design decisions (like how they made decisions to preserve privacy) of the implementations at a virtual lightning conference in April. Lightning Labs CTO Olaoluwa Osuntokun and others on the team have collaborated with him design decisions over the past year.As Osuntokun explained to CoinDesk:“A big factor also [in my opinion] is that now we have a direct deterrence in place against any possible breach attempts, now that the tower code is out there in the open, an attacker now has a very strong disincentive against attempting an attack since it’s very possible that the potential victim has a tower watching their back.”The concept for watchtowers aren’t new, as it was first proposed in the original 2015 lightning network whitepaper as a way to prevent fraud.Indeed, Lightning Labs has been working on an implementation since at least the beginning of last year, as CoinDesk reported. But what’s set to be released is, perhaps, the most-advanced implementation intended for real-world use so far.Since inception, there have been some technological tests for watchtowers, including MIT’s Lit, an open-source project led by lightning white paper co-author Tadge Dryja, and Lightning Peach from blockchain services firm Bitfury.But with LND’s forthcoming release, one notable aspect will be that users will be able to tap the watchtowers to watch real-world participants who are testing lightning today.Then there’s Bitcoin Lightning Wallet, which implements watchtowers in what’s known as the “Olympus Server,” but Osuntokun argues it doesn’t have “auto discovery.”The other benefit of LND’s watchtowers, Osuntokun notes, is that can be run by anyone.“The importance of this release is that once deployed, any routing node can run their own tower to protect their infrastructure, also any business using [lightning network] today can also start to run towers to protect their nodes,” Osuntokun told CoinDesk.But not everyone will want to run their own watchtower, especially as they will eat up a lot of data. So people can start connecting to outside towers to protect their money.As more of these towers crop up, users can connect to as many of the towers as they want to make sure they’re not trusting just one tower to make sure their money is safe. That said, this state of affairs might not happen right away.“We’ll also likely see instances of people running towers in the open for their friends to connect to for themselves,” Osuntokun added.Osuntokun expects that the introduction of watchtowers will lead to a “safer network,” paving the way for users to be able to make payments on the network that weren’t considered safe before. That includes allowing users to put more money into lightning channels via a technology named after Spongebob, he said.This coming release is a big step for the long-awaited technology, but Osuntokun and the Lightning Labs team still have future plans for improving the watchtower software.For example, those users set to run watchtowers will be doing so for free. But Lightning Labs is planning an upgrade to allow people to pay small fees to watchtowers so there’s “financial incentive” to run them as well.Interestingly, though, there’s a bit of a debate going on about the necessity of this approach.Lightning co-creator Dryja has argued that if lightning works, watchtowers shouldn’t actually be used very much. That’s because, if the watchtowers work, bad actors shouldn’t try to broadcast old channels states because the watchtowers will ensure the bad actor loses money if they try.And if there are watchtowers at work, such an arrangement should, in theory, serve as a barrier to keep people from trying to commit fraud. Therefore, they’ll rarely be used and get paid for it. But it’s hard to predict such outcomes until the watchtowers have been deployed and start attracting user attention.As they’re trying to keep watchtowers as privacy-preserving as possible, the team is looking into a way for making these payments to watchtowers more private.To that end, they’re looking into creating a “sort of ecash token.” Ecash is the anonymous currency created by cryptographer David Chaum in the 1980s, and is considered to be one of the precursors to bitcoin.The idea is to allow lightning users to pay for watchtowers in a way that isn’t “linkable.”Then, there’s one other big step. Right now, LND is the only main lightning network implementation following the official specifications to have an up-and-running watchtower so far. As such, other implementations will need to implement their own watchtowers as well.CN Tower and lightning strike image via ShutterstockCorrection: An earlier version of this article implied BLW’s Olympus Server is not open source.

","The complaint charges the defendants misappropriated at least 22,858.822 bitcoin—worth at least $147 million at the time—from more than 1,000 customers through a pyramid scheme called the Control-Finance “Affiliate Program.” According to the documents, from May 1 through October 31, 2017, Reynolds exploited public enthusiasm for Bitcoin by fraudulently soliciting customers to purchase and transfer bitcoin to Control-Finance. He alleged his expert virtual currency traders earned up to 45% trading returns per month, and used risk diversification methods to create a “safe haven” from crypto market risks and protect customers’ Bitcoin deposits. “In reality, the defendants made no trades on customers’ behalf, earned no trading profits for them, and misappropriated their Bitcoin deposits,” write the CFTC in a statement. Reynolds also enticed his clients to invite family and friends to the platform through promises of “affiliate” bonuses. The misappropriation scheme relied on creating unique single-use wallet addresses to receive customers’ Bitcoin deposits, which would then be routed to other, pooled wallet addresses held by virtual currency payment processors and exchanges in North America, Europe, and Asia. CFTC authorities allege these uneconomical and confusing blockchain transactions were executed solely to conceal misappropriation. 
Additionally, when customers requested account withdrawals, Reynolds would illegally divert funds from other customer’s to make the payments.Reynold’s concealed the fraud by providing customers with sham account balances and profit figures that falsely reflected trading profits that did not exist. Weekly “Trade Reports,” which identified illusory profitable trades were also fabricated. In its continuing litigation, the CFTC seeks civil monetary penalties, restitution, rescission, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, trading and registration bans, and permanent injunctions against further violations of the federal commodity laws, as charged.The complaint was lodged in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.Pyramid photo via ShutterStock"

While this simple pattern recognition has little fundamental basis, we note that bitcoin does operate on a four-year cycle of sorts, as the halving of bitcoin’s mining reward occurs approximately every four years. Bitcoin has started to form the spring 2019 bottom we began mentioning last year, although a close look at the chart suggests the recovery may be slightly ahead of itself. Looking ahead, if bitcoin were to continue following the same trend, the implication is a slow climb back toward its all-time high of ~$20,000, theoretically reaching that level in March 2021.The analysts also noted more movement in the crypto markets, saying that about “7 million bitcoins have been shaken out of ‘Cold’ (not active for at least six months) status and have begun trading hands again.”

The next halving is expected in 2020.The team also points to increased Wall Street interest in cryptocurrency as a catalyst for price growth, writing:Perhaps most important is Fidelity’s continued push into the space. After the asset management giant launched Fidelity Digital Assets last October and a custody service in March, numerous reports suggest the launch of an institutional digital assets trading business within the next few weeks. Fidelity also released a survey of 411 US institutional investors which found that 40% are open to owning digital assets within the next five years. Another factor may be Grayscale’s “Drop Gold” advertising campaign, which hit airwaves recently and targets digitally native investor base that may prefer bitcoin to gold as a non-government store of value investment. Yet another could be several corporate crypto initiatives from the likes of Facebook, Nike, and others gaining attention in the media.The Cannacord analysts’ bottom line: It’s looking good.“In any event, bitcoin is so far one of the best-performing assets of 2019,” they wrote.Bull image via Shutterstock"

allows people to issue tokens several layers above bitcoin's base ...","Jun 14, 2019 at 13:00 UTC",Many bitcoiners thought it would be a cold day in hell when BHB Network co-founder Giacomo Zucco admitted that all tokens aren’t inherently scams.,"But, as it turns out, all he needed were the right partners. What started as a client’s request for a more secure alternative to ethereum’s ERC-20 tokens will soon emerge as the first unique protocol for issuing tokens via bitcoin’s lightning network.A better token-minting protocol, Zucco said, could be a game changer for entrepreneurs.“If ethereum is going to die eventually, then we have very high hopes that this will be sustainable long term,” the notorious ethereum critic told CoinDesk.This open-source token project, called Spectrum, includes contributions from investors at Fulgur Ventures and Poseidon Group, startups such as Bitrefill and Chainside, as well as support from crypto exchange giant Bitfinex. The goal is to change the perception that bitcoin is too slow moving for experimentation.Indeed, Bitfinex CTO Paolo Ardoino said in a press release that he hopes to issue a Spectrum-compatible version of the tether stablecoin by the end of the year.“Bitfinex will continue supporting Lightning projects and features in our platforms,” Ardoino added.Spectrum, which uses the RGB colored coin standards anchored to bitcoin, allows people to issue tokens several layers above bitcoin’s base layer. This would complement, rather than compete with, sidechain tools like Blockstream’s Liquid, as well as efforts to enable cross-currency swaps with the lighting network.The fundamental difference here is that ethereum-based tokens bake complex logic, such as automated token distribution related to external factors, straight into the assets themselves via chunks of code called smart contracts.Gregory Rocco, a staffer at ethereum venture studio ConsenSys, told CoinDesk that colored coins never really took off because, compared to ethereum’s built-in support for complex functions, the former required external coordination for the tokens to “represent something” beyond simple units.On the other hand, a Spectrum-compatible RGB token will be more like an international socket converter connecting the token to the bitcoin blockchain via the lightning network, and also externally to software that automates functions similar to smart contracts. There’s still some abstraction, but some bitcoin advocates feel the security trade-offs are worth it.“If you want to do something with tokens, we think Layer 3 is the right place to put it,” Zucco said of his Spectrum solution. “With lightning now you can be competitive, fast, creative, reckless.”Federico Tenga, co-founder of the startup Chainside, told CoinDesk some of his consulting clients have already asked for bitcoin wallets that support such units for use cases such as equity tokenization.“Theoretically you could do anything you could do on ethereum,” Tenga said. “Some people may use RGB on Liquid, ideally, if the standard is adopted, it would be useful across different protocols, maybe even centralized databases. Even for atomic swaps, things like that.”By expanding on the earlier work done by Blockstream developer Alekos Filini, Spectrum contributors are looking to provide a do-it-yourself bitcoin toolkit to enable the network effects that propelled ethereum’s popularity.After all, the reason DIY ERC-20 tokens became so popular is that all ethereum-based platforms and wallets were compatible with them. That made it easy for startups and hobby projects to distribute them with some level of liquidity. Along those lines, Spectrum will provide the first bitcoin-centric standard for tokens that can utilize the lightning network for near-instant transactions.Bitfinex will be the first to promote this protocol, via its new tether variant.Bitrefill CCO John Carvalho said he believes the subsequent snowball effect could turn the bitcoin ecosystem into a “playground where people are going to start doing things like they are trying to do on ethereum.”Since Bitrefill recently closed a $2 million seed round, Carvalho said his startup’s goal for 2019 is “to collaborate with more bitcoin businesses to grow the [lightning] network,” including the exploration of token use cases. To that end, Bitrefill is also hiring.On the other hand, Robert Paone, head of growth at the token exchange platform AirSwap, told CoinDesk it would take considerable work for a lightning-compatible token to compete with ERC-20 tokens. Scalar Capital cofounder Linda Xie agreed with Paone, saying Tenga’s wallet alone would hardly give the protocol an edge compared to all the exchanges and wallets that already support ethereum-based tokens.“The infrastructure around lightning is still not robust enough,” Paone said via email. “Lightning Network is still a bit complex and difficult to interact with, at least in comparison to the ease of using an ERC-20 with MetaMask, MyEtherWallet, etc.”Paone added:“Lightning is a long way off from being competitive against ERC-20.”Perhaps the weather in hell is merely lukewarm with a crisp breeze at this point. Despite a lingering distaste for token sales, BHB Network’s Zucco conceded that, as long as clients continue to seek help with token issuance, Spectrum could provide a useful conduit.“If we assume hyperbitcoinization, we assume many people will have a bitcoin wallet,” Zucco said, referring to the idea that bitcoin will become a dominant global currency. “You can leverage Spectrum because it is part of the logic stack you are already using.”Lightning image via Shutterstock"

The still-nascent network is being built by a series of startups and developers in a bid to create a new level of scaling for the network.On Thursday night, the Chrome extension app‘s version 1.0 was released with features that aim to make onboarding new users to the app much easier. These elements include a more comprehensive built-in wallet and better messaging system.The lightning network is still rather experimental, and even risky to use. At the time of its release, Tippin.me drew support because the app is fairly easy to set up and use as long as a user has a Twitter account.But even if it’s easier than many other lightning apps, it still left something to be desired, prompting the app’s developer, Sergio Abril, to work on a series of new updates that were bundled into version 1.0.Notably, users no longer need to set up a third party lightning wallet app to send tips. Perhaps one of the most confusing parts of the app in a prior version was, if you didn’t have a lightning wallet already, you needed to create one to send a tip. But now, that’s not necessary so long as you have a balance on Tippin.me.The caveat here though is that Tippin.me is a custodial app, meaning that the app itself has control of the funds sitting on the website, rather than the user themselves.Tippin.me is even giving out a little bit of bitcoin to people who join – enough that they can send a couple of tips, that is.In addition, users can now use “on-chain” bitcoin instead of just “off-chain” lightning funds to fill up their tipping jar, and can send messages along with their tips.✏️ Now you can leave a note. Always. No matter if you tip using your balance or a regular Lightning Invoice. pic.twitter.com/kKOk4QRFna— Tippin⚡️ (@tippin_me) May 23, 2019Twitter image via Shutterstock"

Matt Corallo, an alum of the 2016 residency, authored notable efficiency improvements such as FIBRE and the rust-lightning implementation, which makes it easier for users to build and interact with layers of the bitcoin network.“Having diverse funding sources for bitcoin protocol development is essential to maintain decentralization,” said Alex Morcos, co-founder of Chaincode Labs, which funds the program. “The good news is that more organizations fund open-source developers than ever before, including the MIT Digital Currency Initiative, Blockstream, DG Labs, Square, Xapo and others.”According to the residency organizer, Adam Jonas, this year’s 12-week program is the longest session to date. Out of 216 applicants from 39 countries, this fourth class will include eight developers completing the entire program. The other five participants, including a few academics who don’t write code, were only able to attend for roughly three weeks of seminars. The second portion of the residency, after these seminars, is focused on supporting residents as they build independent, shippable projects.Announcing our summer 2019 Chaincode residents:AntoineAmiti @amiziCarla @actuallycarlakcElichai @Elichai2Fabian @fjahrHugo @hugohanoiJames @digi_jamesRichard @remyers_Tim @takinbo(1/3)— Chaincode Labs (@ChaincodeLabs) May 23, 2019A significant portion of the program’s reading materials and presentations will also be shared online through sites like GitHub, so that anyone can use them for studying at home.“It’s by far the longest [program] we’ve ever done,” Jonas said. “The whole idea is we’d like to make this residency available to people regardless of their circumstances. … We’ve just made sure that their costs are covered.”These stipends and flexible requirements, tailored to each participant’s needs, allowed people like lightning developer Jamal James to attend. As an entrepreneur and father of three, taking a whole summer off wouldn’t have been feasible. Yet he plans to apply learnings from the Chaincode seminars to his ongoing contributions to open source projects.“Many are learning on their own little by little, like myself. This residency expedites the ramp-up process substantially,” James told CoinDesk. “Many other companies use the bitcoin network for profit but do not contribute to its development progress.”There’s no better place to look for up-and-coming bitcoin innovators than the kitchen of Chaincode Labs.Unlike many other crypto companies, there are no pool tables, bean bags, or motivational posters about the moon. It’s a simple, sunny office in midtown Manhattan where a handful of developers discuss bitcoin and then write code.“It is a privilege to learn with and from one another,” resident Amiti Uttarwar told CoinDesk.As a fresh-faced Coinbase engineer with just a few years of experience, Uttarwar offers a prime example of an applicant who gained entry to the program with a combination of grit and eagerness. So far, she’s taught herself about bitcoin by contributing to the Bitcoin Core GitHub in her spare time.“I’m very content to do things like seeing through abandoned [pull requests],” she told CoinDesk. “It’s something that I can help contribute and learn a lot from.”Uttarwar will be completing the whole summer program and submitting a final project. Speaking about the program’s open source ethos, focused on support rather than instruction, she said:“No one is telling me what to work on. That’s my question to answer and people here are supportive. They discuss what they think are valuable problems to solve, but at the end of the day it’s my own passion that I am here to follow and they’re creating space to encourage that.”Chaincode sign image via Chaincode Labs"

This is the first payment project built on Neutrino, a bitcoin lightning network client, according to the company announcement.","Additionally, Breez has resolved the issue of how to dispute purchases and receive refunds, “so it’s suitable for every kind of purchase right down to a cup of coffee or paying back a friend,” said company founder Roy Sheinfeld, in a statement.When a user — whether an individual or a merchant — installs the app, Breez automatically opens a payment channel to the Breez hub, which is connected to other Lightning nodes, allowing users to transact with anyone on the network.Both parties cryptographically sign an updated balance sheet whenever a transaction is made to reflect the changing amounts of Bitcoin stored in the parties’ respected wallets. When the transaction is finished, the resulting balances are registered on the blockchain. In the event of a dispute, both parties can use the most recently signed balance sheet to recover their share of the wallet.The project, now in beta, builds on the success of Breez’s open network for Android, which the firm says gained hundreds of users in just two months. The beta for iPhone will initially be running on Apple Developer’s TestFlight, the publishing platform for beta apps. Sheinfeld said developing an iOS product allows the company access to around 98 percent of mobile users worldwide.This announcement is concurrent with a $500,000 investment from Recruit Strategic Partners and Fulgur Ventures. Breez spokesperson Nishal Ratanji views the investment as validating the company’s vision for a “Lightning Economy,” where transactions happen without the expense and hassle of intermediaries such as banks, credit cards, online payment processors, and other custodians.“Bitcoin has the potential to make all other mediums of exchange  – including crypto and fiat currency – obsolete,” said Sheinfeld. “Unfortunately, until other technologies caught up with it, bitcoin was expensive, cumbersome and difficult to move.”The company states the additional capital will help develop Breez’s point-of-sale Lightning app used by merchants to accept bitcoin payments. Yuki Tanaka, Vice President at Recruit Strategic Partners and investor in Breez, anticipates “rapid uptake” of the POS technology in markets such as Japan.Breez’ technology has undergone testing in sandboxes and other multi-tiered environments, according to the company.Wallet photo via ShutterStock"

tax treatment of cryptocurrency. The tax collector has identified ...","Jun 7, 2019 at 04:00 UTC",The Takeaway,"Every tax season, cryptocurrency investors in the U.S. struggle to figure out how much they owe the government. But next April it might be a little bit easier.Last month, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) said it would “soon” issue new guidance on the tax treatment of crypto, something it hasn’t done since an initial notice the agency issued in 2014.In its original guidance, the IRS stated that for tax purposes, virtual currency is treated as property and not as currency. But it left a number of key questions unanswered, such as how to value cryptocurrency received as income.The market has become more complicated in the intervening years, with the emergence of phenomena like airdrops and forks that essentially give people free crypto, raising new questions about tax liability.In a letter last month to Rep. Tom Emmer, IRS Commissioner Charles P. Rettig said the forthcoming guidance would address these issues and others. He did not say exactly when it will come out, and neither would the IRS when contacted by CoinDesk.It’s hard to predict when the IRS will publish the new guidance, but as the extended due date for individual returns is October 15, and for pass-through businesses it is September 15, “they may shoot to have guidance out before those extended deadlines,” said Kirk Phillips, a certified public accountant (CPA).Below, we explain the major areas where the crypto community is looking for more clarity from the taxman.One of the most important questions since the publication of the IRS’ first notice has been how taxpayers should determine the fair market value of cryptocurrency they receive as income (in exchange for goods and services, for instance). This is its cost basis.The 2014 guidance says that if a cryptocurrency is listed on an exchange, the fair market value is determined by converting it into U.S. dollars “at the exchange rate, in a reasonable manner that is consistently applied.”However, unlike securities or property, cryptocurrencies can vary in price widely between different exchanges, said Phillips, the author of “The Ultimate Bitcoin Business Guide.”“Every exchange can have its own pricing methodology, and if you’re using ten different exchanges there will be ten different pricing models,” he said.The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) has suggested that taxpayers should be allowed to use the average rate of the day and the average price of different exchanges to calculate the value of their crypto, as well as aggregating indexes like CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.Any of these methods can work as long as taxpayers are consistent in applying them, AICPA said in comments submitted last year to the IRS. Also, it should be possible to use a combination of methods for various instances.“Taxpayers may have one method applied to one wallet and another method applied to another exchange when determining the fair value of all the bitcoin transactions,” the comment says.James T. Foust, a senior research fellow at the industry advocacy group CoinCenter, suggested a similar approach in a recent report.Users should be allowed to use “either the exchange rate data from one exchange, averaged exchange rate data from a fixed set of exchanges, or a third-party exchange rate index” for each cryptocurrency, as long as they use these methods consistently, Foust wrote.An even trickier task is determining the cost of each unit of cryptocurrency that was spent in a taxable transaction, such as a sale.Lisa Zarlenga, a partner at the law firm of Steptoe & Johnson, explained that when you sell cryptocurrency you should specifically identify the fraction you’re selling to calculate a gain or loss.For other asset classes, there are established ways to do this. For example, in stock trading, taxpayers can apply the average cost basis or the “first in, first out” (FIFO) assumption: that they are selling the earliest acquired piece of stock, so the price is determined as the one registered at the time of the first purchase.“But the simplified approach doesn’t apply to other types of property, only to stock,” Zarlenga said. “So one thing the IRS could do is extend it to cryptocurrency, which would be very helpful.”Even that wouldn’t help in every case, noted Phillips. “First in, first out” can be a problem if the price of the earliest acquired coin is zero — if the owner mined it, for instance.Imagine somebody who earlier mined some bitcoin is trying to cash out another coin which cannot be sold for fiat, and so would have to sell it for bitcoin and then sell that bitcoin for fiat. In this case, the bitcoin, bought and immediately sold, won’t bring its owner any profit, but if the cost basis is defined by the first coins this person ever acquired (which is zero), they will have to report a capital gain.In such cases the FIFO principle might become a trap, Phillips said. “It can create a fictitious gain that doesn’t match the economic substance.”At the moment, there are a number of software platforms for calculating taxes on crypto using different methodologies, and the best the IRS can do is to leave it for users to choose, Phillips said. As the technology and the market mature, better solutions can be found, he said.“The best scenario would be to leave it broadly open for the taxpayer to decide what method they use as long as they apply a consistent methodology: you can’t change it around from year to year,” he said.In addition to buying and selling, there is a list of other events that need clarification for tax purposes, including forks, airdrops and staking.All of these involve people receiving one cryptocurrency because they already hold another. For example, anyone who held bitcoin on August 1, 2017, can claim a like amount of bitcoin cash, which was born that day, and of the other currencies that subsequently split off from the main chain.So what do they owe Uncle Sam from this windfall? Foust’s report for Coin Center notes that when a fork happens, owners of the original cryptocurrency can make no effort to take possession of the new coins and never actually get them, and in this case, there should be no tax effect. But if they do get their portion of the splinter currency and sell it, that should be taxable at the time of the sale.It’s important to consider how much control taxpayers have over the situation when they keep their crypto with custodial exchanges, Foust noted. “If a taxpayer holds their cryptocurrency with a custodial exchange, any actions that the exchange takes regarding airdropped or forked tokens should not affect the taxpayer unless such actions were undertaken at the direction of the taxpayer.”The American Bar Association suggested a different approach in its comments on the 2017 fork that created bitcoin cash. The document, submitted to the IRS in March 2018, proposed that “taxpayers who owned a coin that was subject to a Hard Fork in 2017 would be treated as having realized the forked coin resulting from the Hard Fork in a taxable event” and the value of a new coin should be zero.“It means that at the time of the fork they’ll be treated as earning zero dollars in income. So the fork event itself will not result in any tax liability,” Omri Marian, one of the authors of the comments, explained to CoinDesk. “When they dispose of the forked coin, they’ll be taxed on the entire proceeds of the transaction.”Forks can be treated by analogy with traditional financial and business events, Zarlenga said, and it depends which analogy the IRS will see as more appropriate: possible options include events that currently don’t have tax consequences, like a stock split or a cow giving birth to a calf, but also taxable events like getting free samples and using them, finding property or earning dividends on a property.Another relatively new concept, staking, or using one’s coins to participate in transaction validation on proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchains, is a hot topic in the crypto world. As institutional players have taken an interest in putting their PoS holdings to work, powerhouses like Coinbase have started offering staking-as-a-service.Staking should be treated as ordinary income, as mining already is, because these two activities bring taxpayers new coins in a similar way, AICPA’s memo suggests. The expenses on staking, if there are any, should be deducted from such income as ordinary expenses, i.e. expenses that are common and accepted in a certain business.Three of the issues discussed above – cost basis calculation, cost basis assignment, and forks – are explicitly mentioned in Rettig’s letter to Emmer, but there are several others that crypto tax experts hope the upcoming IRS guidance will address.One with serious consequences for taxpayers is whether keeping, buying and selling cryptocurrencies on exchanges registered overseas should be reported under the rules for foreign bank accounts, Zarlenga and Phillips said.U.S. citizens must file a Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts (FBAR) for any such account holding more than $10,000. Also, Americans holding foreign financial assets worth more than $50,000 have to report them under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA). Failure to report can result in severe penalties, Phillips noted.Should these rules apply to crypto? AICPA believes so: the value of crypto kept in foreign jurisdictions should be aggregated with the value of fiat and other assets abroad and reported under FBAR and FATCA, the institute’s comments say.But if taxpayers keep their crypto in personal wallets and control the private keys, this crypto should be considered “cash which resides wherever the taxpayer resides,” and no FBAR or FATCA compliance is needed, the document suggests.Another issue that deserves clarification is the status of small transactions when people use cryptocurrency to buy goods and services, Phillips said. As it stands, they also have to be reported as taxable events, which discourages spending crypto, and exempting transactions up to a certain threshold could eliminate this problem.Then there are charitable donations: right now, if you’re donating any property valued more than $5,000 you need to get a qualified appraisal, an expert estimation of that property’s value.Cryptocurrency should be exempted from this rule as publicly traded securities are, AICPA said. “The rationale is that the prices for these publicly traded stocks are available on established exchanges, thus not requiring a qualified appraisal. The same is true for most, if not all, types of virtual currencies.”While these questions may sound arcane, resolving them would remove a lot of aggravation for taxpayers. Hence, the community is waiting with bated breath to see how the IRS comes down on them.Zarlenga concluded:“This is going to be the first time they are speaking in five years. A lot has happened in the industry, and people are eager for some input.”Tax report form image via Shutterstock"

Since then, averages fees have swelled to around $1 to $2, a move that coincided with bitcoin’s price “break out” earlier this month.Graph via Bitinfocharts.comBitcoin fees are required because there’s limited room in every block added to the bitcoin blockchain – a feature most blockchains face in order to fulfill its goal of giving users control over their money.When the blockchain gets more popular, a user needs to compete with all the other people trying to get their transaction through. As such, a user needs to spend a bit more money on the fee to incentivize the miners securing the network to push through a transaction faster by prioritizing theirs over others.What might be contributing this time around? As bitcoin blocks fill up with transactions, fees increase. And indeed, the number of transactions waiting in the mempool saw a sharp spike earlier this month.As such, sources painted rising fees an inevitability, especially if interest in bitcoin continues to increase.Seoul bitcoin meetup founder Ruben Somsen, who’s been outspoken about fees, told CoinDesk:“As long as more people become interested in bitcoin, fees will inevitably rise.”To an extent, this is simply how bitcoin works.There’s limited space for transactions in the bitcoin blockchain. This is necessary to keep the bitcoin blockchain small enough so that as many people as possible can download all this data to run what’s known as a “full node,” the most secure way of using bitcoin as it gives users the ability to verify each and every transaction.Even with a limited block size, it takes roughly 200 GB to store the full bitcoin blockchain, the size of a small laptop.“Just like bitcoin is limited to 21 million, block space is limited to roughly 15 transactions per second (4MB block weight per 10 minutes),” Somsen said.He added that this limit explains why fees can seemingly jump overnight.“Users should be aware fees can rise abruptly, particularly because the difference between full and non-full blocks is like night and day. When blocks aren’t full, space is practically given away for free. Once they get full, users will have to outbid each other for it,” he said.And while the recent spike in fees is notable, it’s important to note that average fees today are much (much) less than a couple of years ago, showing how high fees can go when hype drives new people to start using bitcoin.Graph via Bitcoinfees.infoSome cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin cash, have tried to get around this hurdle by increasing the block size. And indeed, transaction fees are much lower for those using the blockchain.But bitcoin developers argue this approach makes it more difficult to run full nodes, threatening the security of the network and the ability of individuals to truly provide checks and balances on the network.Meanwhile, since the blockchain is smaller and has less computing power behind it, it’s less secure, as it’s less costly for someone to double-spend a transaction, thus corrupting the blockchain’s integrity.“The concern I hear the most is ‘How can we get the world to use bitcoin without cheap fees?’ This question reveals a misunderstanding between the fundamental limitations of the system and the desired outcome. As much as we’d all like infinitely scaled blockchains with cheap fees, today this is unfortunately not possible,” Somsen argued.Advocates are hopeful that in the long run, though, fees will be reduced by a new technology that’s in the works: the lightning network.Today, the technology is still in beta (though that’s not stopping thousands of enthusiastic bitcoiners from using it anyway). As the technology advances, advocates hope that it will become the main way of making payments on the network (or at least small payments).Lightning still has fees, but right now they’re very low. To get a transaction sent across the network, lightning fees are a fraction of what bitcoin fees are.“Theoretically as it becomes more pricey to get a transaction included in the blockchain, user behavior will adopt to either make their transaction use more efficient or switch to other off-chain methods of transacting such as using lightning or something else,” Chaincode co-founder Alex Morcos told CoinDesk.And other upcoming technologies could help, too. Segregated witness (SegWit), enacted in 2017, has helped to a degree by carving out more space in the blockchain, and pushing down fees a bit. Other technologies, such as Schnorr, could help as well.But some experts guess that even lightning fees will eventually increase as well. Like that growing on-chain transactions will push up lightning fees as well. Obviously, only time will tell.Bitcoin coins image via Shutterstock"

So far, however, the follow through to that bearish-to-bullish trend change has been anything but bullish. The cryptocurrency witnessed two-way business last week, clocking a high and low of $5,347 and $4,912 before closing almost flat at $5,162. So, the rally looks to have stalled due to the following three factors:Bitcoin’s 14-day relative strength index (RSI), a widely followed technical indicator, jumped above 70.00 on April 2, signaling overbought conditions as the price jumped over 18 percent to highs above $5,000.With the price climbing further to a 4.5-month high of $5,345, the RSI rose to near 90 levels, the highest since December 2017. An extreme overbought reading is considered a sign the rally is overdone and is usually followed by a reaction – a price pullback or a consolidation, as is the case currently with bitcoin. Prices then made numerous failed attempts to convincingly scale $5,300 in the eight days before a drop to $4,912 on April 12. Bitcoin’s 24-hour trading volume across all cryptocurrency exchanges, as calculated by CoinMarketCap, doubled to $21 billion on April 2, validating the bearish-to-bullish trend change signaled by the break above the key resistance of $4,236 and the rally to $5,000.As the cryptocurrency extended gains further to a fresh 4.5-month high of $5,347 on April 8, though, trading volumes tapered off to $17 billion, reinforcing the overstretched conditions reported by the 14-day RSI. Hence, the pullback to $4,912 (Friday’s low) was not surprising. Prices have recovered by more than $200 over the weekend, but volumes are down further, to $10 billion. So, the recovery could be short-lived. The financial markets often test buyers’ resolve by revisiting former resistance-turned-support before building on a major bullish breakout. And that seems to be the case here.For instance, BTC cleared the 100-day moving average (MA) hurdle on Feb. 19. The newfound support, however, was put to test multiple times in the 10 days to March 4 before a sustained move higher. On similar lines, prices fell back below the psychological support of $5,000 last Friday and may drop even further to the 200-day MA, currently at $4,527, as the average is widely considered a barometer of a bullish/bearish trend. The case for BTC shaking out weak holders with a drop to the 200-day MA looks stronger if support a $4,912 is breached. On the weekly chart, BTC created a doji candle on Sunday, which is widely considered a sign of indecisive market.  Interestingly, the doji appeared following a high-volume falling channel breakout. So, it could be considered a sign of bullish exhaustion. Acceptance below $4,912 – the low of the doji – would confirm buyer exhaustion, opening the doors for a deeper pullback to $4,527 (200-day MA). On the 4-hour chart, BTC could be creating the right shoulder of a head-and-shoulders bearish reversal pattern.A break below the neckline support at $4,988 would create room for a drop to $4,629 (target as per the measured move method).  As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $5,142 on Bitstamp, representing a 2 percent gain on a 24-hour basis. Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.Bitcoin image via Shutterstock; charts by Trading View"

Though, most recently in February 2019, Sergeant Alvin Shum took aim not only at Bitcoin ATMs, but also the ideological underpinnings of blockchain generally. He wrote, in a report to the Vancouver Police Board: “Given the lack of a central authority, there is no controlling organization who can monitor or regulate the transfer of funds to ensure a legitimate transaction. This creates a prime opportunity for the criminal element to capitalize on remaining anonymous, as they work to defraud unsuspecting citizens, launder money, and make large-sum anonymous transactions.”This lack of regulation, Shum said, will allow for the incubation of organized and petty crime. Indeed, he points to the rising trend of cryptocurrency police filings in Vancouver year over year, which increased 350% from 2016 to 2017, and saw a further 250% increase in 2018. Current reporting rates indicate the Metro Police will receive 840 reports this year, on track for a 300% increase in reports from 2018.It is unclear how many of these crimes were directly tied to the use of cryptocurrency ATMs, though Shum spoke of a “high-pressure” tactic employed by fraudsters to direct victims to withdraw large amounts of cash and deposit it in a Bitcoin ATM to a predefined Bitcoin address. These scams target the most vulnerable segments of the population including recent immigrants and the elderly. Since Shum wrote to the police council, 15 new machines have been added to the Vancouver metro area, according to coinatmradar.com. In January, the city council suggested a bylaw to “regulate the use and operation of cryptocurrency ATMs, including the requirement for a business licence, requirement for signage to advertise common frauds, requirement for identifications to be used to verify the sender and receiver of funds and requirement of security features.”Four months later, at a May 28 council meeting, Mayor Kennedy Stewart pushed for the outright ban crypto ATMs in the city. Defenders of the machines cite the utility for people who have transaction limits on their bank accounts, and the convenience for conducting cryptocurrency transactions. The third largest metropolitan area in Canada, Vancouver only hosts about 12% of the nation’s total crypto ATMs.The first bitcoin ATM ever was installed at a Vancouver coffee shop in 2013, which contained a built-in palm scanner designed to prevent users from processing more than $3000 CAD per day.“We don’t want drug dealers sending a bunch of coke to the States and then withdrawing cash,” said one of the machine’s owners as it was unveiled at its location in 2013. “We don’t want these to turn into money laundering machines; that’s the worst thing that could happen.”Currently, Vancouver lacks standardization for the types of transactions that can be performed on its ATMs. Some machines require a cellphone number and text verification for transactions over $1,000, while for others push the limit to $3,000, according to CoinATMRadar.com. A few machines advertise no limits at all, according to The Star. A decision regarding the regulation, monitoring, or ban of crypto ATMs is currently being researched by city staff who will report back in the fourth quarter of 2019, Alvin Singh, the mayor’s director of communications, told The Star.Image via Shutterstock."

The two mining pools — BTC.com and BTC.top — carried out the move in order to stop the unknown miner from taking coins that they weren’t supposed to have access to in the wake of the code change. That day, an attacker took advantage of a bug unrelated to the upgrade (and subsequently patched) that caused the network to split and for miners to mine empty blocks for a brief time.In the context of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin cash, a 51 percent attack involves an entity or group controlling a majority of the hash rate which thereby allows them to execute several things they aren’t normally allowed to do, such as attempting to rewrite the network’s transaction history.It’s long been a controversial topic and other cryptocurrencies have suffered similar attacks due to a decline in their hash rates.At one point BTC.top did alone control more than 50% of the power. But BTC.com and BTC.top they were able to join together to reverse the blocks of transactions. According to stats site Coin.Dance, the two mining pools currently have combined 44% of bitcoin cash hashing power.The interesting part of this particular attack on bitcoin cash, though, is that it was arguably executed in an attempt to do something ostensibly good for the community, not to reward the attackers or to take the funds for themselves.But not everyone in the bitcoin cash community agrees. As one bitcoin cash developer, going by the moniker Kiarahpromises, put it in an article from May 17:“To coordinate a reorg to revert unknown’s transactions. This is a 51% attack. The absolutely worst attack possible. It’s there in the whitepaper. What about (miner and developer) decentralized and uncensorable cash? Only when convenient?”The inner details of the mining pools’ attack (as well as the attack that prompted the attack) are complicated.“Since the original split in 2017, there has been a significant number of coins accidentally sent to ‘anyone can spend’ addresses (due to [transaction] compatibility of sigs, but no #SegWit on #BCH), or possibly they’ve been replayed from #Bitcoin onto the #BCH network,” bitcoin podcast host Guy Swann said, explaining the situation on Twitter.But once one code change was removed during bitcoin cash’s May 15 hard fork, these coins were suddenly spendable “basically handing the coins to miners,” he added.The unknown miner attacker decided to try to take the coins. That’s when BTC.top and BTC.com swooped in to reverse those transactions.“When the unknown miner tried to take the coins themselves, [BTC.top and BTC.com] saw & immediately decided to re-organize and remove these [transactions], in favor of their own [transactions], spending the same P2SH coins, [and] many others,” Swann went on.But some bitcoin cash users argue this was the right thing to do.“This is a very unfortunate situation, but it is also what proof of work actually is. The miners in this case did choose to drop prohashes block and from what I heard, it is because they deemed a transaction within it to have been invalid,” responded active bitcoin cash supporter Jonathan Silverblood.Still, others think that this is a bad sign for bitcoin cash, arguing that the event demonstrates that the cryptocurrency is too centralized.Yet the thread of a 51 percent attack is a concern shared across proof-of-work crypto networks (and as mentioned above, some blockchains have been left exposed due to falling hash rates). For example, half of bitcoin’s current hashing power is divided among just three mining pools according to stats website Blockchain.Mining software image via ShutterstockThis article has been updated for clarity."

So using bitcoin to get ...","May 2, 2019 at 07:10 UTC",Today marks a week since I left my home in Venezuela.,"So, here I am, watching the news since 6 a.m., haven’t separated from my phone all day. I’m worried about my loved ones, wondering if I could have done more before leaving, but knowing I had to leave anyway.I left everything I knew behind, but I also fled an escalating crisis that jeopardized my income as a remote worker in the crypto space, where I’ve been now for years.For the Venezuelans using cryptocurrency as a tool to survive the economic consequences of a brutal socialist dictatorship, receiving support from the international community has been vital to the reformation process. The trouble is that this attention has quickly deteriorated into a double-edged sword: a trend.In the last few years, Venezuela has become a favorite pop culture reference in crypto, where bystanders – usually from a privileged background and perspective – spout their ill-wisdom about Venezuelan socialism, economy and migration.This situation is particularly common in crypto. People armed with good intentions and misinformation about how Venezuela’s economy works – or better said, how it doesn’t work – spread their confusion and often diminish an extremely painful experience being shared by millions of Venezuelans.So let me, as someone who used bitcoin to survive in Venezuela, clear up the misconceptions: Bitcoin can’t fix the situation in Venezuela.There are no official statistics of how many crypto wallets there are in Venezuela. There’s no way to know how many each person owns. What it is very clear is that beyond a couple of businesses that accept this form of payment and a few trusted exchange platforms online, there are no services for crypto users available in the country.No ATMs. No prepaid debit cards. Just assumptions.The fallacy that bitcoin could “save” a country’s whole economy assumes the country meets all the requirements for mainstream adoption. Just to start, there would be needed widespread computer and financial literacy, reliable electricity infrastructure, stable internet service and an economy that not only allows the majority of citizens to count on a device to keep their digital wallets but also the safe migration from fiat money to digital money.As we can see, the fact that Venezuela serves as a use case for bitcoin does not mean that it currently has the circumstances for broad cryptocurrency adoption.The hyperinflation has stepped all over the Bolivar, as it also impacts US dollar-based prices that rise on a daily basis. So using bitcoin to get dollars, which is what many Venezuelans currently do, is still problematic and vulnerable to inflation issues.There’s also the mining. Venezuela is famous for its off-the-charts rates of bitcoin transactions and mining activity. But the reality is that having access to cryptocurrency is limited to earning freelance income, trading and mining, which unless you are wealthy enough to own your own mining farm, isn’t a feasible option for most Venezuelans.Foreign initiatives to help Venezuelans have instead revealed widespread ignorance about the actual problems that Venezuelans face.Working personally as a contact for the crypto charity GiveCrypto, owned by Coinbase, during 2018, I found a common problem in this initiative that others have followed: the gigantic misinterpretation of how to help from outside.In the case of GiveCrypto, the goal was unreachable from the start: to feed 300 people with $100 in bitcoin. That’s 33 cents per person. To anyone with an understanding of the economic situation of the country, hyperinflation wouldn’t be this underestimated. Sadly, it’s quite commonplace.And this isn’t an isolated case of donations given without much of strategy based on reality.Crypto donations are very popular nowadays, like in the case of AirTM, which has just announced that will be teaming up with MakerDao on its goal to raise $1 million to distribute between its users in Venezuela, with a goal of giving away $10 to each aid recipient. (Such a small amount doesn’t serve as savings or investment, as it easily vanishes for a week’s worth of expenses.)Despite all the international efforts to distribute crypto in Venezuela, so far there aren’t any solutions able to make a sustainable and adequate difference beyond what a similar dollar donation could have achieved. The important thing for these foreign brands appears to be just cramming a blockchain-shaped peg into any hole.Despite this situation, outsider opinions don’t determine the actual impact of crypto adoption for Venezuelans.It’s true that cryptocurrency is very useful for a specific range of activities that support survival, as an income for freelancers, as a form of remittance for families to receive U.S. dollars at minimum commission, and – when the internet and electricity allow it – for those with an extra income who mine from their GPUs or miners.I do believe that bitcoin has the capacity to influence Venezuela’s financial landscape in a positive way. As cash loses its value, citizens are pushed toward digital money and eventually, that money could include cryptocurrencies.While we are in this process, Venezuelans must stop being seen as a punchline for misleading arguments about the benefits of bitcoin. The country situation has shown the many phases of an economic crisis, and there are invaluable lessons that we have learned that give a whole new twist to our view on financial solutions.That said, the crypto industry needs to stop viewing Venezuela as a testing ground for wild ideas and start viewing us as what we really are: irreplaceable partners in the financial revolution.Venezuelan protest via Shutterstock"

None of the merchants responded to requests for comment, but CoinDesk was able to confirm the deals.Sarah Olsen, head of business development at Gemini, told CoinDesk the exchange company is partnering to provide security for the custodial wallet. In return, the app now provides a new way for stablecoin users to use GUSD beyond trading.“Whether that’s a foreigner who’s coming to the U.S. and more easily able to participate in our economy or vice versa,” Olsen said, adding:“The Flexa network is going to be open source so if you’re a merchant anywhere you can integrate to use their network, even without necessarily interacting with the Flexa team directly. This is going to be the first step toward the future of how we transact value.”Indeed, Flexa co-founder Tyler Spalding told CoinDesk the ability to spend cryptocurrency can actually boost its function as a store of value.“You need the other ecosystem to exist,” Spalding said of bitcoin’s value being tied to utility that includes, but isn’t limited to, trading.Plus, users don’t need to have a credit card or bank account to use this mobile app. A 2017 study by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation found that 8.4 million American households were unbanked. Filter said that the eventual goal is to bring buyers and sellers closer together with a digitally native payments system. For now, Flexa’s crypto exchange partnerships manage conversion on the backend.“We’re actually building payment rails on top of cryptocurrency instead of just trying to integrate cryptocurrency into the payment rails that already exist,” Filter said.Gaming image via Shutterstock"

Kurtz Professor of Entrepreneurship, MIT Sloan School of Management.","The following article originally appeared in Consensus Magazine, distributed exclusively to attendees of CoinDesk’s Consensus 2019 event.The promise and potential of bitcoin as a technology is frequently described in terms of a platform. On top of bitcoin’s permissionless blockchain, the argument goes, all kinds of things could be built to reduce the power and profit of trusted intermediaries. If you fear and resent monopolies, particularly those that are becoming more obnoxious as the digital age progresses, this is an alluring future.It may also be an illusion. Not only are the use cases so far rather limited, but increasingly implementations – upon closer inspection – turn out to be “permissioned” blockchains, which are actually some form of relatively centralized shared database controlled by trusted intermediaries.The terminology and rhetoric may have changed, for activities such as organizing supply chains or clearing financial transactions, but the reality looks remarkably similar to what existed before bitcoin was invented. Bitcoin’s arrival, and the disruptive potential it vaguely represented seemed to goad various industries into exploring an old form of distributed database technology. But this is hardly a revolution.Will bitcoin ever have a more meaningful impact on society than this?Before we ponder that more deeply, let’s pause and reflect on what definitely already exists. Bitcoin has proved to be a remarkably robust means of making certain kinds of payments. It is also a store of value, albeit one that is highly volatile. Of course, bitcoin has also spawned a variety of other cryptocurrencies, which range from being reasonable propositions to completely unappealing.In speculating on whether bitcoin and its imitators can progress beyond these modest beginnings, one important historical analogy is useful: the development of railways in the UK. Some initial railways were highly profitable (e.g., the Liverpool-Manchester line) and others were miracles of engineering (the Great Western) but in various senses less successful. Many of them were more humdrum. There was excessive competition in what became known as “The Gauge War,” as well as crazy moments of speculation and plenty of outright fraud. It was the first big capitalist boom, and it set the tone for pretty much everything else that followed.What did railways really accomplish? There were three major impacts, some but not all of which were clear at the beginning.First, railways broke the grip that canals had on the movement of heavy goods. Turnpikes, or toll roads, were fine for small-scale movement of passengers, but anything heavier needed to go by barge. Not surprisingly, canal owners were generally opposed to railway development, spawning fights that went on for years. This pitched battle was obvious to everyone who understood the transportation element in the pricing of coal and other traded goods.Second, railways encouraged people to travel. The number of people traveling by rail, for example between Liverpool and Manchester, quickly surpassed the number who had been brave enough to take a stagecoach.Third, railways created new jobs, but they also destroyed livelihoods. The people who ran and otherwise benefited from turnpikes did not do well. Over several decades, railways were a net positive on the jobs front – including many occupations that were relatively well-paid (although other jobs were most definitely dangerous and underpaid by any reasonable metric). The scale and scope of the economic and social impact was impressive – and likely a surprise to most people.Most canals eventually went out of business, but what’s striking is how long it took. Some waterways remain financially viable at least until the end of the nineteenth century – roughly 60 years after the railway proof of concept was fully established – even though canal owners had done nothing new or clever to assure their survival.A canal is a canal; there’s not much you can do to invest or upgrade this kind of physical infrastructure. The response on the side of the roads was quite different.Over time, road surfaces improved a great deal. And the internal combustion engine, which gave rise to the automobile, proved to be a technological shift just as profound as putting a steam engine on wheels. Nothing lasts forever, as the owners of railway company stock discovered.Take all of this back to bitcoin and assume that only the narrow version survives – solely a payments system. This could still be a major potential competitive threat to all forms of financial gatekeeper, but only insofar as bitcoin can outcompete its rivals among other means of digital payments. Various companies in this arena are trying to build railroads – some focused on functionality, others aiming for more elegant solutions.But for the customer, it’s just about getting from A to B fastest at the lowest cost.You really don’t care how Venmo works, or what happens when you use Apple Pay in a cab or receive a confirmation from PayPal, or even how your credit card works in a foreign chip & PIN sign system. All you care about is: did you know what the price was going to be, and could you settle in a way acceptable to both the payee and you. Various entities are holding risk within that payments system, but not you – at least not in a way that gives you any concern.Bitcoin’s opportunity lies in how well it too can enable more seamless, low-cost digital transactions for people. (I don’t see bitcoin as a rival for cash, which will rise or fall in various societies, depending on whether people like immediate anonymous settlement – and how they feel about carrying around physical bundles with that characteristic.)How will this shake out? Let’s take a lesson from Isambard Kingdom Brunel, builder of the Great Western Railway. Impressive engineering is good, but interoperability trumps it.Brunel’s railway had a broader gauge than most other British lines, but it was eventually forced to adopt those standard gauges to connect with other lines. In the end, the network effect prevails – we go with what works more often and in more places.Bitcoin may have helped spark the railroad age but there is no guarantee it will win. In fact, currently, it looks more like the Great Western – gets the job done, but at relatively high cost in a small community of users, and with features that can only be regarded as strange.(The oddest part of the Great Western operation was a century-long contract (!) that required all London-Bristol trains to stop in Swindon, where there were monopoly providers of refreshments to that line. Lesson for crypto developers: long confirmation times and erratic spikes in transaction fees may seem attractive to some engineers; to ordinary customers these are discouraging.)Bitcoin could still win the competition to provide better, cheaper, more reliable payments. Recent steps promised by Bakkt, for example, can be regarded as encouraging if they bring bitcoin closer to being used in mainstream commerce (e.g., for Starbucks). And every time I hear about the Lightning Network from a colleague at MIT, I also feel that the system is moving in the right direction toward low-cost, peer-to-peer payments.Still, remember, the railway customer does not care if the railway will strengthen or undermine existing landowners or shake up the structure of power. Similarly, whether particular intermediaries will rise or fall is generally a matter of some indifference.All that matters is: will the trains run on time, and how much does it cost to buy a ticket?Boiler room image via Shutterstock"

Traditionally, an RSI value above 70 is considered to be “overbought” and a pullback in price becomes likely, whereas a value below 30 depicts an “oversold” market that is usually due for a positive correction. The RSI of 50 tends to act as the dividing line between a market that is bullish and one that is not. Bitcoin’s RSI on the weekly time frame, which speaks to the momentum of its longer-term trend, is showing newfound strength while printing 65 – its highest value since the week of Jan. 8, 2018, just a few weeks after the cryptocurrency reached its all-time high near $20,000.BTC/USD Weekly ChartAs is shown in Bitcoin’s weekly price chart above, the RSI has indeed surpassed the traditional bull market barrier of 50, as well as the range of 53-60, which acted as a base during the 2016-2017 bull market as well as resistance to its preceding bear market.From early 2014 to late 2015, the weekly RSI was unable to scale above 60, capping any momentum the cryptocurrency had gained during that stretch. In October of 2015, however, the RSI was finally able to break above the level, in turn showing the momentum had gained enough strength to shift the entire market from a bear to bull trend. Bitcoin’s price then went on to rally some 8,000 percent all while the weekly RSI remained above 53.Interestingly, the same development seems to have just occurred with bitcoin’s latest push above $6,000, putting its market momentum firmly back in historically bullish territory.All said, the RSI values on the lower time frames are already overbought so corrections in price can be expected, but the longer term bullish view on bitcoin’s market will remain intact so as long as its weekly RSI can defend 53, the base RSI of the previous bull market.A general rule of thumb is to use indicators like the RSI in conjunction with other indicators to avoid any false signals. In this case, bitcoin’s price trading above the 200-day moving average and its MACD having completed a bullish cross indeed solidify the bullish argument presented by the weekly RSI.Disclosure: The author holds several cryptocurrencies, please see his author profile for more information.Bitcoin bull  via Shutterstock; charts by Trading View"

These sponsors include Naval Ravikant, Balaji Srinivasan, Mark Pincus, Andrew Lee, IDEO CoLabs Ventures, Nic Carter, Matt Walsh, Meltem Demirors, Li Xiaolai, Jehan Chu and Sam Engelbardt.“I’d say Satoshi’s Treasure is so exciting because it’s the pure joy of a treasure hunt,” Carter told CoinDesk. “It’s global and anyone can participate.”Meanwhile, many have formed online teams to collect the 400 key fragments required to move the prize from the game’s bitcoin wallet, Meltzer said. Yet even the dynamics of these teams highlight how bitcoiners are unique compared to other online gaming communities. For example, software engineer John Cantrell cracked the code for one of the first key fragments then promptly detailed on both Twitter and GitHub how he managed to do it.“For me, it’s really all about education,” Cantrell told CoinDesk.Since then, Cantrell also joined several teams and created a free tool called Ordo to help teams organize clues and fairly credit contributions to the hunt, which will come in handy for any winning team looking to divvy up the loot.Cantrell said so far the largest team using Ordo appears to have 600 members.Another large team, called the Magellan Clan, told CoinDesk via email it has 100 members from 30 countries. It even made a unique token to reward people beyond the team who provide tips.With so many players flocking to Satoshi’s Treasure, Cantrell isn’t the only one making tools and services for other players.The 18-person ToshiCiphers clan, for example, has launched a merchandise store for teams looking to make shirts and other swag. ToshiCiphers clan member Devon Kramer told CoinDesk they’ve had four orders for custom shirts so far.While many players in this game were, like Cantrell, already bitcoin veterans, some gamers have been attracted to Satoshi’s Treasure by the collaborative play, rather than the prize itself. Clues are spread both around the physical world and online, requiring a wide range of skills and languages for teams to be competitive.“We have a couple of people who are new to cryptocurrency, didn’t know much about blockchain, but they were brought in by the hunt,” Kramer said.Kramer’s teammate, who goes by Yann, added:“I think we are playing the first Great game of the Augmented Reality Era.”Satoshi’s Treasure hunters image via Jess Wang"

network. Under the hood, once a transaction is broadcast, it ripples ...","Jun 2, 2019 at 10:30 UTC",A newly-proposed relay protocol could reduce the “transaction bandwidth” used up by bitcoin nodes by up to 75%.,"Called Erlay, the proposed protocol alters the way transactions are relayed so that they use significantly less bandwidth, an important resource for the nodes that make up the network. The authors include The University of British Columbia researcher Gleb Naumenko as well as two bitcoin development heavy-weights: Greg Maxwell and Pieter Wuille.The way bitcoin works is that nodes across the world tie together to form a network. Under the hood, once a transaction is broadcast, it ripples through this vast network of hardware.Erlay changes up how the announcement of these transactions is performed. As Naumenko described in a bitcoin dev email announcing the new proposal:“The main idea is that instead of announcing every transaction to every peer, announcements are only sent directly over a small number of connections (only 8 outgoing ones). Further relay is achieved by periodically running a set reconciliation protocol over every connection between the sets of withheld announcements in both directions.”The results, according to Naumenko: “We save half of the bandwidth a node consumes, allow increasing connectivity almost for free, and, as a side effect, better withstand timing attacks. If outbound peer count were increased to 32, Erlay saves around 75% overall bandwidth compared to the current protocol.”One important result of this new protocol, the researchers argue, is that by reducing how much bandwidth this process takes, nodes can increase the number of connections they hold with other nodes.As low-level and technical as it sounds, it’s important research, particularly as it relates to the security of the network itself.The security of bitcoin depends at least partly on connections between nodes. This new protocol could make room for more connections, and the more connected a node is, the more “hardened” it is against network attacks.Naumenko described one such attack to CoinDesk: “The most trivial example is Eclipse attack, when a target node gets isolated from the longest chain, because all its connections are established with an attacker. In this case, an attacker, for example, can make a target node believe that they paid that target node (show shorter chain with that [transaction] in), without actually submitting transactions to the longest chain.”How this attack could impact bitcoin is described in more detail in a 2015 research paper.So, if the protocol is so important for the security of bitcoin, what’s next? Will it be added to Bitcoin Core, the most-popular software implementation of bitcoin?“A couple weeks ago I chatted with several Bitcoin Core contributors and the feedback was generally positive, although they requested more experiments. Now, as those experiments are added, I would give more time for everybody to familiarize themselves with new technical bits,” Naumenko told CoinDesk.As a rule, new technology isn’t added to bitcoin unless the most active contributors to the software, as well as the wider ecosystem that actually operates the nodes (and, unlike miners, don’t receive any kind of built-in subsidy or compensation), agrees with it.“We received positive signals from the community, which encourages us to continue working on the implementation,” he added. If the community continues to like it, then: “The protocol should become part of one of the future major releases (hopefully, the next one).”Fiber optics image via Shutterstock"

Along those lines, mostly when talking about technology satellites, advocates emphasize that the technology has the ability to onboard people who are less fortunate, maybe living in a part of the world that doesn’t have easy access to the internet.But Back actually made the case that it can provide user cases for people in luckier situations, too.First, and perhaps most practically, Back argues that this is actually, in some ways, cheaper than a normal internet connection. You can save on the bandwidth costs of a normal internet connection by outsourcing a satellite to download bitcoin updates for you.Then there’s the privacy angle. If you aren’t careful, anyone can glimpse online to see the IP address associated with your node. But with a satellite connection, it’s much harder to see who’s connecting to it to grab the full node data.“It gives you a great deal of privacy. By using satellite to receive a full node, no one knows you’re participating in the bitcoin network,” Back said.Finally, downloading a bitcoin full node by satellite also offer an alternative in the case of outages, which exchanges and merchants are all privy to as they need to run some form of node to connect to the network This bad for miners, who can lose money, as they won’t be able to mine so-called “block rewards” – each of which is worth $87,000 at current market prices – for however long they lose their internet connection.“I’ve heard firsthand stories from mining farm operators that they’ve been forced to run a farm on a cell phone signal for a week,” Back said, arguing that a satellite is a much cheaper form of backup.Adam Back image via Alyssa Hertig for CoinDesk"

The hourly ...","Apr 10, 2019 at 10:30 UTC",Bitcoin has managed to fend off any further attacks from the bears during April 9’s tug-of-war trading session.,"The cryptocurrency is now trading in a $100 range between $5,187 and $5,287 placing its price firmly above the prior April 4 low and cementing a higher low on the daily chart.The hourly chart is also looking more favorable on the new daily trading period (April 10), with bullish momentum having maintained a hold above $5,200 support over the last 24-hours despite multiple dips in its price.Bitcoin now looks set to continue its climb within the previously discussed ascending triangle – typically bullish indicators – with a measured target set at $5,885 should BTC break above the upper trendline at $5,320–$5,350.So how do we arrive at the $5,885 target? We can roughly calculate the potential move by measuring the height between A and B (the upper resistance line and the lowest drawdown in price within the pattern). That figure is then added to the upper resistance line above point C at the point of breakout, producing a new figure as a price target.As can be seen, an exaggerated bullish divergence has also taken shape on the RSI, recorded from April 8–April 9, meaning a continuation in price is being supported additionally by the indicator on the hourly chart.The daily chart shows the bulls maintained a higher low above April 4’s red candle. That kept intact the bullish market structure above the key 100-period and 200-period moving averages yesterday, which are slowly beginning to converge for a bull cross.Should those two lines cross bullish, then greater buying pressure would become the norm with a new bull run on the cards.The RSI shows a divergence from price, printing lower lows while price continues to print higher lows, signaling greater bullish conditions ahead for the world’s top crypto by market value.Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency at the time of writing.Bitcoin image via Shutterstock; charts via TradingView "

","At 13:15 UTC, the price 11th largest crypto by market cap rank reached a 24-hour high of $139.31, a figure more than 120 percent higher than its UTC opening price of $62.99, according to CoinMarketCap data. On some exchanges, however, BSV’s sudden price surge was even more drastic, increasing as much as 214 percent to reach $195 in the BSV/USDT market on the Singapore-based cryptocurrency exchange Huobi Global.The surge is due in part to the announcement that Craig Wright has registered copyright claims on the Bitcoin Whitepaper and original code and promised to revert the copyright to the Bitcoin Association.A release today notes:Wright intends to assign the copyright registrations to Bitcoin Association to hold for the benefit of the Bitcoin ecosystem. Bitcoin Association is a global industry organization for Bitcoin businesses. It supports BSV and owns the Bitcoin SV client software.Messari data reveals the total exchange reported 24-hour volume for BSV is $447.6 million whereas its “Real 10” volume from the 10 exchanges identified as the sole exchanges reporting honest volume figures in a report from Bitwise Asset Management reveals today’s volume figure is closer to $31.8 million.Bitcoin Satoshi Vision, typically abbreviated as Bitcoin SV, is a fork of the bitcoin cash blockchain and was recently delisted from a number of well known exchanges including Binance, Kraken and Shapeshift due to its main proponent Craig Wright, claiming that he is Satoshi Nakamoto the creator of bitcoin, which many assume to be fraudulent.

quantity field, chose “Market” from the drop-down menu and hit ...","May 8, 2019","If you are interested in buying or selling a cryptocurrency, there are few better places to look than one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trade volume, Binance.","Founded in 2017 by Changpeng Zhao – who earned the number-one spot on CoinDesk’s 2018 Most Influential list – Binance rose to prominence during the historic crypto market-wide bull run in 2017 by supporting a wide array of cryptocurrencies in what was, and perhaps still is, one of the fastest and most reliable trading platforms.In fact, Binance became so popular, so quickly that CZ and Binance both became worth more than $1 billion in less than one year, officially making it one of the first companies to achieve “unicorn” status in the cryptocurrency industry.Yet despite its reputation as a destination for crypto traders, it’s not exactly easy for users who lack a traditional trading or investment background to navigate their way around.In this piece, we take a step-by-step look at how to use Binance and conduct a trade on the exchange.First thing’s first, you’ll need to create an account. Anyone is able to sign up since Binance does not require customer information, but by doing so “you acknowledge and declare that you are not on any trade or economic sanctions lists” as per its Terms of Use.This includes citizens of the member countries in the UN Security Council Sanctions list, the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Treasury Department (OFAC), among other groups.The terms also state each user must be at least 18 years of age. Binance reserves the right to cancel or freeze any account If the terms are disobeyed.If the restrictions do not apply to you, to sign up simply navigate to the homepage and click register.You will then be asked to enter a minimal amount of personal information such as your email address, password, and a referral ID if you have one.As per Binance’s referral system, you will receive 50 percent of your referrals trading fees.After you fill in the required fields, click “Register” and complete the captcha, a confirmation link will be sent to your email address.Once the link is clicked, your Binance account is ready to be used.Now that your account is activated, but before exploring the rest of the exchange, you’ll need to add funds to your account if you wish to buy or sell any cryptocurrencies.Pay with credit cardBinance has a feature that allows users to purchase certain cryptocurrencies directly with their Visa or Mastercard credit card. If you are a qualified candidate, navigate to the “Funds” tab and select “Buy With Credit Card.”You will then be required to enter the purchase amount of the desired cryptocurrency and whether you will be paying with the US dollar or euro. Cryptocurrency purchases by credit card are limited to BTC, ETH, and LTC at this time.There is a minimum processing fee of $10 or 3.5 percent of the total order – whichever is more expensive. After completing this step, you will need to confirm your billing information, email address as well as your identity.A valid government issued form of ID is required to be submitted to confirm your identity.Once all of the required steps have been completed, the newly purchased cryptocurrency should reach your Binance wallet within 10-30 minutes.Deposit from walletYou can also make a deposit by sending funds from a separate cryptocurrency wallet into your Binance account.In order to do this, navigate to the “Funds” tab once again and click “Balances.”On this page, you will see all of the cryptocurrencies available for trading on Binance. To deposit the corresponding crypto into any of these, simply click the “Deposit” button next to the crypto asset of your choice.Next, either scan the QR code from your cryptocurrency wallet or paste in the address and then send.Once that’s complete, wait for the transaction to process and you’ll be ready for trading.Let’s go back to the home page now that your funds are ready to be used.Here, you will again see all the cryptocurrencies that are tradable on Binance and their respective markets.For this example, let’s say you previously deposited 0.0024 BTC (~$10) into your account and now wish to trade it for NEO.First, you’ll need to find the right NEO market.Since you want to spend BTC in order to get NEO, click the “BTC Markets” tab and then type NEO into the search bar.Click the appropriate row and the page where trading takes place will open.Trading moduleThis page may look intimidating, but you can easily get the hang of it with a bit of practice.Plus, most cryptocurrency exchanges have a similar trading interface so what you remember here, in all likelihood, will be relevant elsewhere.The left section of the screen is known as an order book.Here, you will see all active buy and sell limit orders. A limit order is simply an order that will only be placed at the user’s desired price, given there are buyers or sellers interested at that level.If you would like to learn the “in’s and out’s” of an order book, check out our comprehensive guide, but for now all you need to know is that the top of the order book (red) is where the limit sell orders wait to be filled and the bottom section (green) is where the limit buy orders wait to be filled.The right side of the page is more simple – the above section shows the other cryptocurrencies that can be traded and the lower section shows the public trade history of the market currently being viewed.Trade example: Buying NEOThe center of the page is where the real magic happens.Here lays a chart feature that shows real-time price action and technical analysis indicators. Just below the chart is where you will actually execute the trade, so let’s buy some NEO.If certainty of execution is your priority, select market order. If you are interested in only buying at a specific price level, select either limit or stop-limit order.For the purposes of this example, let’s place a market order, which will be placed immediately at current market prices.Now, just enter the amount of BTC desired to be spent and how much NEO you want to purchase. Binance has a useful shortcut for entering the purchase amount and it is based on a percentage of your bitcoin balance (or any other appropriate trading pair).Let’s spend 50 percent of the BTC balance so there is some left over, perhaps for another trade.The last step is to click the big green button “Buy NEO.” Since this is a market order, the trade for 0.58 NEO should have completed instantly, but that is most likely not the case if you selected limit or stop-limit order.To check on the status of your order, look towards the bottom of the page where it says “Open order.” As the title would suggest, if your order has not yet executed, in other words, is still “open,” it will appear in this box until it has either been canceled or filled.When it has been filled, it will show up in the lower box highlighting your 24-hour order history, just as how this order has below.In order to sell, simply follow this same process but execute a market or limit sell order.While Binance does have a decentralized exchange in the works, the existing platform is centralized and susceptible to hacks like many other websites, so it’s recommended funds are only held on the exchange for as long as necessary.In order to withdraw, navigate back to the “Balances” page. If you would like to see only the cryptocurrencies you have a substantial balance in, check the “hide” box.Now select the withdrawal button in the NEO row and have your destination address or QR code handy. Paste the address and select how much you want to withdraw.Last but not least, click submit and wait for the transaction to complete.The Binance Launchpad is a token launch platform exclusive to Binance and plans to offer token sales for new projects.Binance handpicks which tokens to launch based on a number of factors including project maturity, scalability and adoption readiness, team quality and the ability of the project to benefit the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem.To ensure the sales are being conducted in compliance with regulatory regimes around the world, each user must verify his or her Binance account.Completed token sales, as well as those scheduled for a future date, can be seen on the home page of the Binance Launchpad. It’s worth noting that the token sales operate on a “first come, first serve” basis and usually sell out in just minutes, so be sure to do your due diligence.If you successfully participate in a Launchpad token sale, the tokens will be automatically credited to your Binance account.Like most modern cryptocurrency exchanges, two-factor authentication (2FA) is enabled on Binance and is highly recommended to be set up in order to add an extra layer of protection to your account.In order to do so, navigate to your account summary by clicking the user avatar in the top right of the home page.Once directed to your account page, a prompt will likely appear suggesting you to enable 2FA, which happens to automatically pops up when a new user accesses this page.Binance allows two methods for enabling 2FA, via SMS or Google Authenticator.With the SMS version, simply enter your mobile phone number and the verification code sent to the corresponding phone and you will be all set.If Google Authenticator is your 2FA of choice, download the mobile application, open it and scan the QR code provided by Binance. Next, you will be asked to write down a 16-word recovery phrase to be used as a backup in case you lose access to this google authentication.Lastly, you will be prompted to enter your account’s login password and the authenticator code found in the Google Authenticator mobile app. Once complete, this form of 2FA security will be complete.ProsConsImages via Binance website"

That is, as long as they have a satellite receiver with Blockstream Satellite’s specific software installed.goTenna is a startup exploring technology that allows users to connect with others without the internet — to send text messages to others, for example. Instead, they have formed their own “mesh network” for sending messages. The limitation is that a user needs to connect to someone close-by, within a mile, to send a transaction.As of late last year, the goTenna device also connects to their bitcoin wallet on an Android phone that users can put bitcoin in and then use to send bitcoin transactions without an internet connection – as long as they’re able to connect to another goTenna user that has an internet connection.goTenna explained in a statement:“What this means for users is that they will be able to receive blockchain data via a satellite and send signed bitcoin transactions out via the goTenna Mesh network without a direct internet connection.”“The goTenna app is that it lets you send signed bitcoin transactions over our mesh network. If you’re local provider is censoring you or your connection is down for some reason, maybe due to a natural disaster, you can still get it to the internet,” said goTenna decentralized applications engineer Richard Myers in an interview with CoinDesk, adding that it also provides a more private way of sending bitcoin transactions.This integration is part of a larger effort to make it easier for people to send offline transactions if they need to. It also makes Blockstream Satellite, which perhaps sounds more like a sci-fi project than a thing that will actually help people, a bit more useful.“The need for this technology might not be in New York City, but other parts of the world. It could be useful there instead of centralized internet providers,” said Myers, adding that right now, users can send transactions with Blockstream Satellite using other technologies, such as high-frequency radio, but these technologies generally requires “more specialized knowledge.”This technology gives users one other option that Myers argues is easier. “It lowers the bar for who can do this kind of wizardry,” he said.Image via goTenna"

The Fidelity Center for Applied Technology, an R&D division that has dabbled in bitcoin mining, hosted the conference at the financial services giant’s global headquarters in Boston. Fidelity has embraced the crypto markets more than most incumbents; this year it launched Fidelity Digital Asset Services, which handles custody of bitcoin for institutional clients and is expected to roll out trading in the coming weeks.But aside from welcoming the 300 or so attendees and a brief overview of mining history by Jurica Bulovic, innovation manager at Fidelity Labs (a different R&D unit), Fidelity mostly ceded the stage to guest speakers. In their presentations, these miners and others sought to disprove the popular perception that the copious amount of electricity devoted to securing the bitcoin network – 0.26% of world consumption, according to Digiconomist – is an environmental threat.Miners are constantly searching for cheaper energy, and this is why they will be a catalyst for renewable power development in the near future, said John Belizaire, CEO of Soluna. His company is building a large wind power generating farm in Morocco: the primary consumer of that energy will be Soluna’s miners, but the rest will go to the country’s electricity grid, Belizaire said.“Bitcoin is at the center of the next great infrastructure that we’ve never seen before. We’re going to go to places that have incredible renewable energy sites,” he said, predicting that the industry’s image will change as a result:“In a decade we will start referring to bitcoin completely [differently].”Mining will help monetize the building of global computation networks around the globe, as well as new renewable power sites, he said, and, unlike in the past, it will not require government subsidies.The widespread notion that “bitcoin is mainly mined with dirty Chinese coal” is not true, said Chris Bendiksen, the head of CoinShares research department. His team has recently conducted research on the main regions and energy sources for mining.Miners are located mostly in mountainous regions with big rivers and a high share of renewable power in the overall energy mix, CoinShares found: 48 percent of all global mining happens in the Chinese province of Sichuan where renewable energy is prevalent (90 percent of the overall energy mix), and 12 percent takes in other parts of China that together get around half of their energy from renewables.Another 35 percent of mining is done in various parts of the Western world including British Columbia and Quebec in Canada, Washington State in the U.S., and Iceland. The rest of the world is producing the remaining 5 percent, the report says. Most of these places have high shares of renewable, especially hydro-generated energy in their power generation mix.In addition, a lot of hydropower in the world is “heavily underutilized,” Bendiksen says, as hydropower dams are built the regions that have suitable landscapes and big rivers, but are not necessarily heavily populated. Miners can put this capacity to good use, he said.Asked how the data about miners’ concentration was gathered, Bendiksen acknowledged that it mostly comes from miners themselves.“We just trawled the entire internet, including forums of miners, we talked to miners themselves, read news articles,” he told CoinDesk.While miners’ communities, for example, in China, might be very “insular” and uninterested in what the West thinks and knows of them, they still willingly answered questions, Bendiksen said.Another source of readily available, cheap energy can be the natural gas released during oil mining (so-called associated gas), said Stephen Barbour, president of Upstream Data. Oil companies need to get rid of the gas, which they aren’t using, so they burn it. As a result, 140 billion cubic meters of gas are wasted every year, according to General Electric’s data.Barbour said his company developed a system that captures gas at an oil drilling site, transforms it into energy and then uses it for bitcoin mining. According to him, a prototype set up on one such site in Canada, has already helped to reduce carbon emissions there by over 10,000 tons in a year.“It’s been mining since 2017 and it’s been running on vent gas,” Barbour told CoinDesk. In the prototype phase, using a 45-kilowatt power plant and Antminer S9 mining machines manufactured by Bitmain, the system mined around 20 bitcoins over two years.Upstream focuses mostly on oil producers in the Canadian provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan, which are rich in oil. There are also plans for Texas, Barbour said: a small oil drilling company, the name of which he said he couldn’t disclose, purchased a mining data center for an unfruitful drilling site.“A company was searching for oil, it didn’t find any. They did find a lot of gas, but the gas is worthless, you can’t sell it to anyone in Texas right now. So they can either abandon the well and lose money or they can invest in bitcoin mining,” Barbour said.But more often, “oil companies are a bit shy of buying bitcoin mining facilities,” he added. However, associated gas is a liability for them, so helping them get rid of it by mining is actually a service, for which oil companies might let miners on their territory for free, he said.None of this is to say protecting the environment is bitcoin miners’ top motivation. “They probably don’t care at all,” Bendiksen said. However, mining bitcoin on fossil fuels is just too expensive, he added, concluding:“Mining is a relentless driver to lowest global energy prices.”Image of the Fidelity Mining Summit courtesy of Fidelity "

Now with Booking.com, Priceline, Hilton and Marriott, Lolli CEO Alex Adelman told CoinDesk travel purchases account for 40 percent of sales.“We are leveraging our Hotels.com and Booking.com partnerships to begin international expansion in the coming months,” Adelman said about plans for the next six months. “Canada has been in high demand and we think that’s going to be a great test market for us. That will help us expand to other countries as well.”He estimated almost half of Lolli’s “tens of thousands” of users are getting bitcoin for the first time, based on the types of user feedback his team gets. When it comes to trips costing several thousand dollars, including both flights and hotels, some Lolli users have managed to earn more than $100 worth of bitcoin rewards.“We want that number to grow,” Adelman said of new bitcoiners. “Now we’re starting to test content for teaching people what ‘stacking stats’ means. … Hopefully, someday 90 percent of our customers will be new because we want to make the market bigger.”Stepping back, Lolli launched in September 2018 after raising $2.35 million from Forerunner Ventures, Digital Currency Group, Square engineer Gokul Rajaram and other investors.Speaking of Square, the company’s Cash app has its own cash-back rewards system, called Boost. But Adelman isn’t daunted by the prospect of competition. To the contrary, Lolli is starting work on its own mobile app as part of plans for international expansion. Lolli users skew younger than other cash-back-affiliate programs, which is swaying new merchants to join the company’s 900-member network and lure customers away from Amazon.“Most international customers are on mobile, so launching mobile in the U.S. is a good way for us to prepare to go international,” Adelman said. “People who want bitcoin are young, millennial customers that merchants are interested in. there’s an opportunity for merchants to make money and that drives bitcoin adoption.”Switzerland-based Lolli fan Stephanie Verin told CoinDesk she looks forward to the startup’s international expansion, adding:“They managed to went away from this kinda black, gloomy and very masculine branding that a lot bitcoin related content/startups are still using…It’s the first startup I am seeing that is thinking outside the bitcoin ethos and yet is accepted by all the bitcoiners.”Travel image via Shutterstock"

statistical ...","May 3, 2019 at 13:00 UTC","With gold on the defensive and down roughly 6 percent since mid-February, bitcoin may continue to shine brightly in the near future. After all, experts have found the two assets to be inversely correlated.","The 90-day correlation coefficient between bitcoin and gold – a statistical measure of linear interdependence between the two variables – is currently seen at -0.71, the lowest level since March 20.A negative number represents an inverse relationship, i.e. meaning the two variables are moving in opposite directions, which has been the case between bitcoin and gold since November. For instance, the yellow metal found takers at $1,200 on November 13 and was flirting with the psychological resistance of $1,300 at the end of December. During the same period, bitcoin, fell from $6,200 to $3,122, according to Bitstamp data. It is worth noting that correlation does not imply causation. When a strong correlation develops between the two variables, it does not necessarily mean that one is causing or influencing the other. The gold rally witnessed in November-December could be associated with the broad-based US dollar weakness triggered by speculation that the Federal Reserve will pause interest rate hikes in 2019. Bitcoin, however, did not benefit from the same dollar sell-off and tanked to 15-month lows near $3,100.The negative correlation had weakened somewhat in the first quarter with bitcoin recovering to $4,000 by February end amid an extended gold price rally to a February 20 high of $1,346. By February’s end, however, the gold market completed pricing in the Fed rate hike pause, which the central bank confirmed in March, opening doors for the “sell the news” move in the yellow metal.Gold ended March below $1,300 and has remained on the back foot ever since. As of this writing, it is trading at $1,270 per ounce, representing a 5.6 percent drop from February highs. Interestingly, bitcoin surged past key resistance at $4,236 on April 2 – two days after gold found acceptance below $1,300 – and jumped to a five-month of high $5,622, according to CoinDesk price data. This revived the strong inverse correlation with the precious metal. With gold looking increasingly weak, there is reason to believe that the cryptocurrency market leader may extend its ongoing rally past the psychological resistance of $6,000.From a technical perspective, gold is indeed developing a bearish market structure referred to as the “head and shoulders” reversal pattern, which suggests more downside is likely in the near future. The pattern generally appears as three consecutive troughs, the middle of which being the tallest, essentially depicts the failure of a trend to maintain its bullish streak of successive higher price highs. Gold broke down from the pattern on April 16, confirmed by its price finding acceptance below the pattern’s neckline, with its scope now set for the 200-day moving average currently located at $1252. Support will need to be provided in order to avoid further depreciation.That said, we can create a measured breakdown of this pattern by subtracting the size of the head from the breakdown point, which suggests more downside is possible toward $1220. Again, correlation is not causation, but gold’s near-term bearish outlook may be a sign of positive things to come for bitcoin’s direction.Gold image via Shutterstock"

as founder and CEO of the gaming company Pixelmatic since ...","May 24, 2019 at 12:00 UTC",An ardent critic of the hype surrounding crypto token sales is set to do the unlikely: launching a token.,"Samson Mow, the CSO of bitcoin startup Blockstream, has also been serving as founder and CEO of the gaming company Pixelmatic since 2011. The new plan will see Pixelmatic use Blockstream’s new token platform for launching security tokens on bitcoin via its sidechain Liquid.By way of that platform, Pixelmatic will issue tokenized securities for its upcoming game Infinite Fleet, a science fiction, humans-versus aliens space fighting game. “Take command of a fleet and join the epic war for humanity’s survival!” as the game’s Twitter profile reads.Yet perhaps the most unusual part of the plan is that it will be launched on bitcoin – or, at least, a network that is tied to the bitcoin blockchain.Part of why Mow has been so critical of token sales, he argued in conversation with CoinDesk, is that so many of them have been launched on the smart-contract platform ethereum. (He went so far as to contend ethereum has “failed” investors because of its scalability problems.)But perhaps most of all, he’s skeptical of pervasive fraud in the space. “My main criticism is there’s no substance. The leaders of many ICOs have no intention of actually creating something,” Mow told CoinDesk.Mow thinks Infinite Fleet offers substance. “That’s why we’re doing a security token, not a token with no obligation,” Mow said, adding that they’re trying to pioneer a new token model called a “dual-token model,” which effectively uses two tokens for two different purposes.To raise funds, they’re in the process of selling a so-called “security token,” a breed of crypto-token that’s gotten quite a bit of attention recently, as they’re subject to regulation and require investors get a return on their investment.The security token sale is private, with a few “bitcoin OGs” participating so far. With this token, Infinite Fleet is aiming to raise $16 million by the end of the year, when they expect more exchanges to be processing security tokens.Then, the utility token INF will be disbursed randomly to players in the game. Users will receive coins based on “proof-of-participation,” or how much time they put into the game and whether they participate in “major” game events.The idea of creating completely virtual currencies for in-game economies isn’t new, but according to Mow, Pixelmatic is looking to put a unique spin on the idea given its characteristics.For example, one of the most popular MMOs, the World of Warcraft, utilizes in-game gold as a means of payment for items and between players. But persistent issues with so-called “gold farmers” who were selling their funds to other players led game maker Blizzard to effectively peg the value of gold to a “WoW Token” that can be bought and exchanged for either gold or 30 days of play-time. Conversely, in-game gold can be spent on such tokens.Then there’s EVE Online, a similarly sci-fi focused game that utilizes several different currencies across its galactic economy. Such designs can grow complicated and have real-world ramifications: EVE once hired an economist in an attempt to steer the economy away from recessions that could have a negative impact on a user’s gaming experience. Not to mention, the population playing the game is larger than Iceland’s, and one of its “wars” cost an estimated $300,000 based on the value of in-game assets lost.It’s against this backdrop, Mow told CoinDesk last fall, that he originally got interested in bitcoin specifically because he saw a path for disruption of these gaming economies.With Infinite Fleet, Mow envisions this same model, but with a cryptocurrency thrown in, giving it the same benefits.“Our token will be like that but not under our control,” he said, adding that, rather, the players own and control their own tokens.As far as use cases, Mow highlighted one that addresses an issue experienced by players in MMOs where players can pool resources, only to suffer when one bad actor walks away with the loot unseen.“People have been known to infiltrate guilds and steal the funds,” Mow said, arguing that with Liquid, guild members can build a more secure guild model governed by certain rules, like “multi-signature” bitcoin transactions, which require, say, five of 10 guild members to sign the coins with their private keys before they can be released.“There are many interesting applications,“ he argued.So, why is Pixelmatic launching the token on Liquid? Is it because Mow is the CSO of Blockstream, the company the built the sidechain tech?“I do believe in the technology,” Mow said, arguing its “well-suited” for financial transactions because it doesn’t “stuff smart contracts in the chain.”He added that Liquid allows for more privacy than the main bitcoin blockchain because it uses “confidential assets,” an experimental privacy technology that shields the types of assets associated with transactions.He added that, down the road, there are other features that Blockstream plans to add to Liquid, including the lightning network, a technology that could help bitcoin improve its overall scalability.Blockstream has been working on an implementation of lightning specifically for Liquid, which Mow sees as a useful feature that could be used in the game if enough people play it and transact with the native digital currency.“In case of a game, if you have a critical mass of people using the INF token, you can use lightning,” Mow said.Game image via Infinite Fleet trailer video"

Wright, the technologist who claims to be the pseudonymous creator of bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto.","A redacted declaration filing from Kleiman v. Wright surfaced today, which details Wright’s purported ownership and the trustee scheme of the Tulip Trust, which supposedly holds over one million bitcoin. According to the filing, access to the holdings of the trust requires participation of all trustees, at least one of whom he hasn’t been in contact for several years.The court document was originally filed on May 8, and also points to the existence of a second Tulip Trust, known as Tulip Trust II. Days before the document was filed, a federal court ordered Wright to disclose his bitcoin addresses in the ongoing lawsuit. Wright is being sued by Ira Kleiman on behalf of the estate of his brother, the late Dave Kleiman. The nChain chief scientist is accused of scheming to “seize Dave’s bitcoins and his rights to certain intellectual property associated with the bitcoin technology.”Kleiman is seeking half of the 1.1 million bitcoins the two are said to have mined together, or its “fair market value,” as well as compensation for infringement of intellectual property. The initial complaint did not seek to ascertain whether Wright is the person behind the Nakamoto identity, stating that “it is unclear whether Craig, Dave and/or both created Bitcoin.”According to the declaration released Thursday, the Tulip Trust consolidated the bitcoin Wright mined and purchased between 2009 and 2011. The trust first came to public attention through a leaked document on December 9, 2015. Allegedly written in 2011 by Dave Kleiman, a forensic computer investigator and author, the document describes a trust fund containing exactly 1,100,111 bitcoin, “to be managed by at least three people but not more than seven at any time.” The document also declares the bitcoin holding is to be returned to Craig Wright on January 1, 2020.These new developments come amid an ongoing mediation process, which as of June 18 has yielded no results — in the words of the mediator, as reported by attorney Stephen Palley, “we are at an impasse.”As it stands, Wright is due for deposition in Florida on June 28.According to Wright’s court declaration, seven trustees were named, including Craig Wright, David Kleiman, and Ms. Uyen Nguyen — whom Wright claimed he has had no contact with since 2016. That said, Kleiman was the initial, and sole, trustee before others were appointed.Panopticrypt Pty Ltd, an Australian entity now in liquidation was also named alongside an unnamed Seychelles entity and CO1N Ltd., a U.K. entity liquidated in 2017. “The contacts at CO1N were Dave Kleiman and Ms Nguyen, who was terminated as director on June 1, 2016. Presently, there is no one other than myself who was a contact for this entity.” Nguyen was allegedly terminated as director of CO1N in June 2016.The final trustee listed is “the holder of PGP key IDs, which is Satoshi Nakamoto,” with Craig Wright parenthetically related.In the past, Wright has said that the trust is encrypted using a a method called Shamir’s Secret Sharing Algorithm. The only way to access them, he’s said, is to accrue the collective private keys in order to decrypt it.Wright complied with the directive pursuant to a court order to produce bitcoin holdings for all bitcoin Wright mined prior to December 31, 2013. The filings were subsequently sealed. The Tulip Trust II was settled in 2014 in Seychelles with Equator Consultants listed as a trustee. Wright and his wife Ramona Watts are the primary beneficiaries. The holdings of this second trust are unknown.Wright also hinted at an inaccessible trove of bitcoin mined between 2011 and 2013 by staff at HighSecured and Signia Enterprises under his direction, to be held on behalf of the original Tulip Trust. Wright alleges the principles of HighSecured were arrested in 2015.Wright has claimed in the past the Tulip Trust is currently inaccessible. In the court document Wright said:“Access to the encrypted file that contains the public addresses and their associated private keys to the Bitcoin that I mined, requires myself and combination of trustees reference in Tulip Trust I to unlock based on Shamir scheme.”Dave Kleiman passed away in 2013. Last December, the court denied Wright’s attempt to dismiss the lawsuit, saying that he “converted at least 300,000 bitcoins upon Dave’s death and transferred them to various international trusts.”The court filing can be found below:6/20 Filing by CoinDesk on ScribdJustice statue image via Shutterstock"

That’s why we invest in mining farms, equipment and pools and participate in mining ourselves,” Howard Yuan, managing partner of Fundamental Labs, told CoinDesk.But unlike what most retail miners have been doing – buying second-hand miners ahead of the summer – Yuan’s firm is maximizing its mining scale by investing in the latest and most powerful equipment on the market, such as Bitmain’s AntMiner S17.The unit price of these newest mining models made by manufacturers like Bitmain, InnoSilicon and MicroBT, ranges from $1,500 to $2,000 each, and will be ready for shipment in large quantities over the next two months.“We don’t buy old machines since our focus is to participate in mining for the long term. And second-hand equipment like AntMiner S9 won’t be useful once the summer season ends,” Yuan said.The capital for this investment comes from a 300 million yuan, or $44 million, mining fund that Fundamental Labs recently closed, which is the first phase of its overall plan to raise 1 billion yuan ($150 million) this year exclusively for further deployment in cryptocurrency mining.Yuan said the firm was launched in 2016 with about $30 million of its proprietary capital, and has since then grown the total portfolio to over $500 million through five series of funds. Its holdings include an equity investment in Coinbase (which the U.S. crypto exchange confirmed to CoinDesk) and Binance’s BNB token.  The firm declined to disclose the names of its limited partners, except to say they are from the traditional industries as well as family offices in China. Because it’s using brand new products, Yuan said Fundamental also will be less risk-averse than individual miners when facing bitcoin’s price volatility. He told CoinDesk:“We think crypto mining will become more institutionalized in the future. It’s crypto capitalism. Retail miners will be gradually squeezed out because of challenges like price volatility and increasing computing difficulties.”Such new capital entering the crypto mining space with more powerful equipment will likely give another boost to bitcoin’s total hash rate in the coming months. While InnoSilicon and Bitmain’s new products, such as T3 and AntMiner S17 can compute as much as 45 to 50 trillion hashes per second (TH/s), Shenzhen-based MicroBT claims its latest M20S can even reach 70TH/s.Even assuming Fundamental Labs will run all of its 20,000 to 30,000 units with the least powerful of those, its plan could increase the bitcoin network’s total hash rate by at least 1,000 quadrillion hashes per second (PH/s). That would account for about two percent of bitcoin’s total hash rate at the moment, which is around 50,000 PH/s, according to data from Blockchain.info. On May 2, the bitcoin network’s total computing power reached a six-month high above 58,000 PH/s. Mining farm operators in China previously estimated this figure will go up to 70,000 PH/s during the summer.Yuan said with the plan to raise a total of $150 million for its mining fund this year, the firm will further build up and maintain a mining scale that consumes about 200,000 kilowatts per hour (kWh).Given the company only considers the latest mining equipment, which mostly consumes two to three kWh, each, that means it aims to scale up its facility to run 60,000 to 100,000 units of new equipment in total throughout the year.That could translate to a hash rate boost between 3,000 PH/s to 5,000 PH/s to the bitcoin network. By comparison, mining giant Bitmain currently owns about 2,000 PH/s, or four percent, of the bitcoin blockchain’s computing power.After the summer season, Yuan said his firm will shift its focus to other provinces in China like Xinjiang which has more fossil fuel power stations, as well as central Asian countries like Kazakhstan.Howard Yuan image courtesy to Fundamental Labs"

During a conversation centered on the challenges of his new presidency, Bolsonaro talked about projects created by his predecessor’s administration. One of the efforts was a $11.5 million project that aimed to create an “indigenous cryptocurrency”. “We are cutting expenses. We were about to use 40 million Reales to teach natives to use bitcoin,” he said. In fact, Bolsonaro said, he doesn’t even know what bitcoin is. “I don’t know,” he said. “Is it a coin?” The National Indian Foundation (Funai) and the Fluminense Federal University (UFF) created the project in order help bank Brazil’s indigenous people. The country’s Ministry of Human Rights, Family and Women vetoed it in January.The shutdown of the cryptocurrency project was one of the first actions taken by Bolsonaro’s administration. This is the first time the leader commented about bitcoin in public although Brazil is one of the most active countries in Latin America’s blockchain sphere.Despite the president’s initial ignorance of bitcoin, the growing cryptocurrency and blockchain ecosystem in Brazil is impossible to ignore.Bolsonaro’s administration itself also showed certain preferences for blockchain. Back in February, the leader appointed an economist involved in blockchain and cryptocurrency to run the Central Bank of Brazil.Currently, Brazil is one of the biggest cryptocurrency markets in Latin America and has the highest bitcoin trading volume in all the region, reaching nearly 100,000 BTC in April alone.This is not the first time the Brazilian leader has been connected with blockchain. Bolsonaro’s ideology inspired a group of supporters to create an alt-right cryptocurrency named after him, the Bolsocoin, whose apparent goal is to “get mainstream attention and rages [sic] antifa and feminist scum.”"

The Gibraltar-based firm, parent of the startup RSK Labs, claims Lumino can handle up to 5,000 transactions per second (tps).While that may pale in comparison to the 65,000 tps the Visa network is capable of processing (according to the payments giant’s latest annual report), it’s still an improvement over bitcoin’s transaction throughput, which rarely cracks two digits.Conceptually, Lumino is similar to bitcoin’s lightning network, in that it allows parties to transact off-chain, in so-called state channels, until one party decides to record their balance on the blockchain for final settlement.However, in addition to bitcoin, Lumino can also scale transaction volume for the tokens running on the RSK Network, RIF said. There are about a dozen such tokens currently, according to the RSK block explorer.That network, launched in early 2018, is itself a so-called sidechain, or ledger that runs in parallel to the main bitcoin blockchain. An asset can be locked up on the main chain and then traded on the sidechain, and vice versa. This allows for complex things like smart-contract creation and token issuance to occur on the sidechain without burdening the bitcoin network.RSK Labs said in May 2018 that the sidechain, also known as Rootstock, could process 100 transactions per second, but even then recognized that this was not sufficient for mass adoption. Hence its work, already underway at the time, on Lumino.“While the RSK Network added smart contract capabilities and on-chain scaling improvements on top of the bitcoin network, it is not enough to achieve transaction processing levels on par with those offered by major payment processors around the world,” RIF said in a press release Tuesday.Trying to scale purely on-chain will create problems down the line, the company added, “as every record saved on the blockchain needs to be saved forever. It is going to become increasingly difficult to maintain and validate multi-terabyte blockchains in the coming years.” (As of this writing, the bitcoin blockchain is over 216,000 megabytes big, or 0.216 terabytes, according to Blockchain.com data.)
By contrast, Lumino offers “near-instant processing capabilities and network transaction costs at a fraction of a cent,” RIF claimed. Still, Sergio Lerner, head of research and innovation at RIF Labs, was careful to describe the new network as only “the first step towards a scalable network infrastructure.”Lumino also integrates with the previously launched RIF Name Service, allowing participants to create aliases when opening state channels and sending payments, instead of the usual cat-walked-on-the-keyboard alphanumeric strings that can bewilder non-technical users.Sergio Lerner image via CoinDesk archives"

But the Liquid Securities platform will provide a web interface, like the one you’re on right now, on which businesses can issue and monitor tokens. To create one, instead of coding up the rules, the app will feature options to set up the rules, such as regional restrictions and “investor accreditation.”Under the hood, they’ll be enforced by bitcoin’s multi-signature smart contracts.And to deal with the question of regulation, especially seeing as regulators are starting to crack down on tokens in the space under securities regulations, Blockstream will also offer a Liquid Securities API for “additional compliance and legal services.”Liquid Securities image via Blockstream"

According to blockchain data firm TokenInsight, as recently as April 8, an investment in most types of crypto mining equipment would take 200 to 350 days to pay for itself.But bitcoin’s climb from the low $4,000 range in early April to well above $5,000 has resulted in a drop in the payback period (a miner’s price divided by its daily profit) for several secondhand models to less than 200 days. “When the payback period is apparently below 200 days, it has made more miners feel there’s an opportunity,” said Michael Zhong, a mining analyst at TokenInsight. “That further incentivizes their buying demand for secondhand models and leads to a price jump and will bring the payback period back above 200 days again.”This market change is having an impact on businesspeople like Darius Sharif Samani, an independent miner who owns machines in China and brokers equipment sales. When he started asking around in March, Samani managed to buy secondhand AntMiner S9 units for $140, he told CoinDesk. Made by mining giant Bitmain, these machines can run computations at a speed of 14 terahashes per second, or TH/S.Since then, the price for the same machine has jumped to at least above $250, and it would cost more than $280 to buy an advanced version of the AntMiner S9 that generates 14.5 TH/s, while some have even asked for $320 per unit, Samani said. That works out to $22 per terahash.If prices keep rising, equipment purchases could become prohibitive for most. Samani told CoinDesk:“Nobody besides a couple of the well-financed farms is willing to spend $23 per terahash on new hardware.”Some mining equipment wholesalers have even told Samani that some models were sold out.“First time in months somebody told me they’ve run out of certain models, which hasn’t been the case in like, forever,” he said.But he also remains suspicious about whether wholesalers were telling the truth when they made claims about running out of stock.“Some are waiting until a bidding war for some models to start,” Samani said. “There may be lots of individual miners, but they are getting squeezed out.”TokenInsight’s Zhong echoed that sentiment, adding it’s usually the mining equipment wholesalers and secondhand equipment market-makers that are stockpiling gear.Apart from the recent bitcoin price jump, the overall anticipation of cheap hydro-power during the water-abundant summer in China could also be contributing to the increasing demand for equipment.Mining farm operators in China’s southwestern region previously estimated there will be over 1 million machines running in the area during the summer, and that this could push the hash power of the bitcoin network as a high as 70 quintillion hashes per second (EH/s).That would be a new all-time high – the previous record of 60 EH/s was set in August of last year, according to Blockchain.info data.If all of the extra 10EH/s comes from new models like the AntMiner S17, which generates around 45TH/s, that would mean 220,000 additional units devoted to the market in the coming months, assuming bitcoin’s price holds steady. (10 EH equals 10 million TH.)But if it all comes from older secondhand models like the AntMiner S9, each with a hash power of 14TH/s, the number of units coming online would be much higher, at 700,000.Currently, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is now seeing around 50 EH/s in terms of total hash power.Chris Zhu, co-founder of Poolin, a China-based crypto mining pool, said another driver of the increasing demand for secondhand equipment is new capital from newcomers.“There’s a large amount new capital weighing in this year, who didn’t experience mining cryptocurrencies in a water season in a bearish market,” he added. “And they are much less risk-averse.”One new entrant is a $44.5 million mining fund raised by the Shanghai-based blockchain investment firm Fundamental Labs, which is betting on both equipment and mining farm operations ahead of the summer season.Both Zhu and Raymond Yuan, founder of Fundamental Labs, acknowledged that this year there will be more mining farms than usable mining equipment circulating in the market.“There are many what’s called ‘futures farms,’” Zhu said – farm operators who are courting customers without having the actual farm built in advance.These players are hoping to gather money and equipment from customers upfront as the initial capital to build the infrastructure, Zhu said. To him, this strategy is “very unreliable” because “they are promising to build something out of thin air.”Fundamental Labs’ Yuan agreed, saying there’s a limited supply of new cryptocurrency mining equipment from manufacturers. He added:“Mining farm operators may have overestimated the attractiveness of the water season, so the total supply of available equipment slots at mining farms is outnumbering the total supply of mining machines.”Indeed, while major mining equipment manufacturers have launched more powerful machines this year, few have been able to ship market-ready products at a large scale.For instance, Bitewei, or MicroBT as the firm brands itself in English, launched the WhatsMiner M20S in April with a hashing power as high as 70TH/s while consuming as little as 48 watts of power per hash.MicroBT founder Zuoxing Yang told CoinDesk that 1,000 to 2,000 of these will be available for shipment in May but orders larger than 10,000 units have to wait until July and August.Similarly, miners who order InnoSilicon’s newest model T3, priced at $1,580 with a hash power of 43TH/s, will also have to wait until June for shipment.Bitmain, on the other hand, has rolled out its flagship AntMiner S17 and S17 Pro in recent months but the first batch won’t be shipped until sometime in May and those are already marked as sold out. It also appears that Bitmain is holding up some of its S17 products as it is selling the hash power of these machines via cloud mining contracts, as advertised on its website.But as powerful as these new machines appear to be, their payback period is still longer than that of secondhand machines, given their higher costs and a lower bitcoin price compared to the bull market of 2017.“Miner makers also largely rely on the bitcoin price to decide on their production scale,” Zhong said, concluding:“Unless bitcoin’s price can keep steadily above $8,000, otherwise, miner makers won’t likely be producing their latest, more powerful equipment at a large scale.”Bitmain AntMiner image via CoinDesk archives"

Speaking on Saturday at the Magical ...","May 11, 2019 at 19:00 UTC",Mobile phone manufacturer HTC wants to let its smartphone customers plug into the bitcoin blockchain.,"Speaking on Saturday at the Magical Crypto Conference in New York, HTC’s Phil Chen revealed a new low-cost version of its blockchain phone, the EXODUS 1s, announcing that the device will be capable of acting as a full node for the bitcoin network, meaning customers will store the entire blockchain’s data on their devices.The company will also provide a software development kit (SDK) available for its Zion Vault, HTC’s crypto wallet app, and eventually plans to open-source the code behind its social key recovery mechanism.Phil Chen, HTC’s decentralized chief officer, told CoinDesk that the company is targeting a release by the end of Q3.“[The 1s is] going to be a lot cheaper, it will be a lot more accessible,” he said. The device will retail for between $250 and $300.Specifications have not yet been released for the device.The 1s will be based on the HTC EXODUS 1, which was announced at CoinDesk’s Consensus 2018 and released later in the year. While customers could initially only purchase the device with crypto, HTC opened up fiat payment options in February.The most striking promise of the 1s will be its ability to run a full bitcoin node. Chen explained that the company saw that as “a really important piece of the pie” for the bitcoin ecosystem.“We think that’s foundational to the whole decentralized internet and just the whole fundamental premise,” he said. “If you don’t own your keys, you don’t own your bitcoin, you don’t own your crypto.”The EXODUS 1 was designed to let users maintain their own private keys, which in turn formed the basis for this next move, Chen said.He believes that from a technological standpoint, smartphones today are physically capable of handling the effort, noting that computing chips and storage media are constantly becoming cheaper and more efficient.“We expect that phones will be powerful enough,” he contended, adding:“The bitcoin blockchain is about 200 [gigabytes], and it’s growing about 60 gigs per year. And those numbers are reasonable to hold on a smartphone. Imagine the iPod with 256 gigs … of course the music fan wants to keep the whole music library but the crypto fan wants to keep the whole bitcoin blockchain.”By letting users run full nodes, HTC is giving them the ability to verify data themselves, he said.“[You can] be a part of the bitcoin revolution by contributing to the security of the whole network,” said Chen.That being said, the EXODUS 1s will still be capable of conducting normal smartphone operations, with room for music, videos, pictures, apps and dapps.HTC plans to support the bitcoin blockchain at launch, but Chen did not rule out adding support for other networks. The chief considerations include how much memory and bandwidth other networks would require, he explained.“I think running light nodes, like ethereum for example, is definitely doable, [but] it all depends on the spec,” he said.The company also plans to focus on public blockchains, which Chen believes are far easier to support than private networks. That said, HTC is not planning on adding support for any other networks explicitly at this time.“I see bitcoin as one of the most important if not the most important blockchains,” he said. “We definitely want to support that first and given what bitcoin stands for, open, neutral, censorship-resistance.”He also noted that bitcoin is “the most proven” network, and supporting it was at least a little symbolic as well.Once HTC is able to launch the 1s, Chen expects that his team will be able to apply the experience from supporting a bitcoin node to other networks.Its new 1s falls in line with HTC’s goal of contributing to the broader crypto ecosystem.Demand from the EXODUS has been “in track” with HTC’s expectations, Chen said. However, the company is still soliciting feedback from the community. To that end, HTC is publishing its Zion Vault SDK for developers and ultimately plans to make its social key recovery mechanism available for other wallets to utilize (though there is no set timeline for this last part).The company is also continuing to support its existing EXODUS 1 product, adding an Etherscan widget for customers to explore the ethereum blockchain and support for further non-fungible tokens.Chen said the company would continue to develop products for the line, targeting a user-focused experience.“I think people who really care about the public blockchain space see the role we play in this ecosystem. We’ve gotten a lot of support from developers and we’re very authentic about empowering developers,” he said.Image via Magical Crypto Conference "

LedgerX is the second company to receive approval to offer physically settled bitcoin futures; other firms, such as Intercontinental Exchange’s Bakkt, Seed CX and ErisX plan to enter this market. (While Bakkt’s own futures contracts have been self-certified, the firm is waiting for the New York Department of Financial Services to license its warehouse).Unlike the cash-settled bitcoin futures listed by the Chicago exchanges Cboe and CME, in physically settled futures the buyer receives the underlying commodity when a contract expires, rather than the fiat equivalent.Monday’s approval means that New York-based LedgerX can not only list these bitcoin futures contracts but crucially can offer its products to retail clients, not just institutional ones.No timeline was provided for when LedgerX might start to offer futures. but chief operating and risk officer Juthica Chou told CoinDesk that the company was looking to be the first provider of this product in the U.S.“There’s no doubt that we’re looking to be first, we’re looking to be the incumbent,” she said. “We think we’re better positioned and we want to be there to serve customers of all sizes.”LedgerX would follow the same self-certification process that it already underwent to offer swaps and options, Chou said, adding:“Ultimately the products are not that economically different than what we’re already offering … but this would open up to a broader [market].”While Bakkt has previously announced that it would be testing its own physically-settled bitcoin futures contracts in July, a firm launch date has yet to be announced. Seed CX and ErisX have likewise not yet announced when they would launch their futures products (or forwards, in Seed CX’s case).LedgerX applied for the DCM in November 2018 and has since been working with the CFTC. It already offers swaps and options contracts for customers.The DCM application came on top of LedgerX’s existing Swap Execution Facility (SEF) and Derivatives Clearing Organization (DCO) licenses, which approve the company’s exchange platform and clearinghouse, respectively.The new license carries with it the same set of responsibilities that the other two have, Chou said, though securing the latest approval “was a pretty difficult process” due to the issues involved.LedgerX is now eyeing a gradual rollout of its new products, including its retail-focused Omni platform.“We want to be careful and conservative so we’ll soft-launch the Omni product,” she said. “We’ll take customer feedback and we’ll make sure it works.”The company will roll out its existing swaps and options product to all customers, as well as a new block height option product which the company recently self-certified.Chou added:“We have a pretty extensive waitlist and we’ll work through that until we feel comfortable.”LedgerX team image courtesy Juthica Chou"

Dorsey said that he’d interviewed “tens of candidates” for the post before arriving at Lee as his choice.The new hire will take responsibility for building the remainder of the team, as well as defining its future path, he said. Square is currently eyeing a maximum of five engineers and one designer, who will likely work on a single project rather than many.That’s because Dorsey aims to “make some step changes to various aspects of the ecosystem, versus an iteration,” he said.While one would expect devs, the choice of a designer comes as something of a surprise in such a early stage project. Dorsey put this down to the need for the need to make cryptocurrencies more accessible, as well as providing education on the technology.Joking that the team doesn’t want any “jerks,” Dorsey also said that it’s important any candidates must have good technical abilities.“We want to see significant open-source contributions to various projects. Bitcoin Core is a great example of that, but there’s others, too,” he said.As for its particular role in the crypto ecosystem, he explained that Square Crypto might conduct “grungy, but meaningful” code reviews in order to speed up development. While there are plenty of devs helping out on cryptocurrency projects, few are working on checking the correctness of the code, Dorsey said – changing that could give a “huge boost” to the space.Outside that, there’s need for work to improve efficiency and security. “There’s still a number of big flaws within the Bitcoin community right now,” Dorsey told TNW.The CEO also indicated that he wants to keep the role of Square in the mechanics of the team to a minimum, ruling out cheap stock options in favor of optional bitcoin salaries in order to build a desire to better “serve the community.”The work carried out by the team should also be open to the public. While it’s not set in stone yet, Dorsey suggested Square Crypto could operate like a traditional open-source project.Aside from the more general development work of the crypto team, Square is eyeing bitcoin technology in its products too. Back in February, Dorsey announced during an interview with podcaster Stephan Livera that there are plans to integrate the lightning network – a still early-stage bitcoin payments tech – with Square’s Cash app.Jack Dorsey image via CoinDesk archives"

A relatively new cryptocurrency launched back in January, Grin leverages novel technology to obfuscate transaction information.One developer, Daniel Lehnberg, said about the large monetary gift:“A really big and heartfelt thanks. We’ll ensure [we] put that to good use.”Users can donate funds at any point in time to five different public addresses accepting Grin, bitcoin, ethereum and zcash. The most recent donation of 50 BTC was placed in the Grin bitcoin SegWit address and mined on the bitcoin blockchain Sunday.Still, the donation is also a sign that Grin’s funding model may be working.According to a recently released financial report, funding for the project has increased almost two-fold over the past four months from an estimated $65,237.35 to $123,423.73. Now, with the additional 50 BTC donation, the project holds roughly six times the amount of funds it started out with at the top of 2019.Going forward, funds are expected to be put towards project needs including building and deploying key infrastructure, website design and marketing development, mining hardware design and more.Grin application image via CoinDesk archives"

When investors did not get the returns and their mining computers back, several of them filed complaints.Back in November 2018, the FIOD and police raided the suspect’s home and business premises and seized expensive goods such as bags, shoes, and a bike.The FIOD said fighting money laundering is the priority for the government as it is one of the “serious” crimes.Earlier this year, Dutch financial authorities were planning a licensing scheme for cryptocurrency firms to prevent money laundering and terrorism financing.

Casey is the chairman of CoinDesk’s advisory board and a senior advisor for blockchain research at MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative.,"In the relentless cat-and-mouse game between regulators and cryptocurrency developers, the cats are about to add some serious firepower – this time in the form of a global alliance.But if you think the intergovernmental Financial Action Task Force’s forthcoming know-your-customer (KYC) compliance standards spell the end for the mice, think again. If anything, the FATF’s move, expected to be released next month, will drive developers to accelerate work on non-custodial exchanges and other tools that will make it easier for end-users to transact directly outside of regulated intermediaries.As CoinDesk managing editor Marc Hochstein explained last week , the new rules are likely to require exchanges and other custodial entities that take custody of their customers’ cryptocurrency to obtain identifying information about both parties before allowing a transaction over their platforms.Functioning much like the FATF’s “travel rule” for correspondent banks, the new regulatory approach would be backed by the task force member institutions’ unique powers to “graylist”– and ultimately blacklist – entire countries if they are judged to be non-compliant.When combined with the European Union’s forthcoming AMLD5 anti-money laundering rules for cryptocurrencies, the new framework conjures up the image of an all-encompassing global system for cryptocurrency transactions in which no one user is unaccounted for.Libertarian-minded cryptocurrency believers will view this as an abominable surveillance system that contravenes the censorship-resistant principles upon which bitcoin was built.From a practical perspective, the new rules are going to be a burdensome imposition on custody-handling exchanges. It may well spur industry consolidation as smaller players may find the compliance costs too high. Blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis, which counts regulatory agencies among its clients,  argued in a submission to the FATF that the new rules are impractical and would drive more activity in cryptocurrencies into services that make it much harder for authorities to track illicit activity.The rules could also, sadly, add to the “de-risking” problem that excludes billions of under-identified people in developing countries from the global financial system.But all is not lost. In most countries, there is nothing illegal about holding cryptocurrency itself under your own custody. And, as was clarified in  guidelines recently published by the Financial Crime Enforcement Network, or FinCEN, the world’s regulatory institutions won’t, for now at least, be imposing the same KYC requirements on providers of self-custody wallet software.What is likely to emerge, then, in parallel to the FATF-regulated ecosystem of regulated custody-taking institutions, is an entirely separate economy of peer-to-peer exchanges among people who control their own cryptocurrency.If you hold your coins with Coinbase, you will no longer be able to send or receive crypto to or from just any old bitcoin address if it has been through a KYC process. Once you move your funds into a non-custodial account, you’ll be free to send them to any self-custody address, but if you’ve never formally associated your identity with that address via a regulated entity, you won’t be able to transact with a Coinbase address or one administered by any other regulated custody provider.The point, though, is that this otherwise draconian regulatory framework still leaves room for Satoshi’s vision of a peer-to-peer payments system. And with more work on technical and business model development, that system could still become sizable.In fact, the new rules could be a catalyst for developers to more urgently tackle the core technical and logistical challenges that have limited the adoption of self-custody cryptocurrency wallets. These challenges fall under the categories of security, market coordination and fiat on-ramps, all three of which are currently showing significant progress.A key incentive for people to hold their cryptocurrency with custodial services such as Coinbase has been an unwillingness to risk either misplacing their private keys or having them stolen. Stories of hacks and loss abound and have long discouraged newbies from “being their own bank.”In recent years, secure hardware wallets such as Ledger and Trezor have made it easier for people to control their assets without exposing their private keys to online hackers.  But security experts claim to have found vulnerabilities. And the user experience is still far from convenient for the non-savvy.Still, a new generation of smartphones that employ military grade security and end-to-end encryption should make it easier to securely hold cryptocurrency, locally, on a device that easily connects to the Internet for global payments.  HTC led the way in this technology.  Samsung is now catching up.Phone makers are employing sophisticated, locally stored biometric proofs to indelibly tie control to a user. When combined with multi-signature technologies, human-friendly key recovery solutions such seed phrases kept with trusted associates, and a bit of education, the risk of loss can be reduced to an immaterial level.Other changes to the ecosystem, such as decentralized insurance programs and more aggressive measures to hold phone carriers to account for “SIM swap” attacks such as the one that led  Michael Terpin into a lengthy legal battle with a hacker and AT&T, will also boost confidence.Over time, more and more people are going to feel more comfortable managing their own key custody.The next challenge is to reduce the widespread dependence on custody-based exchanges.Cryptocurrency users need to efficiently find buyers and sellers, and until now, that has left them dependent on centralized exchanges, which are key targets of the new regulations.The answer lies in the rapidly growing field of decentralized exchanges, where custody is retained by the investor and where technologies such as atomic swaps allow seamless peer-to-peer transfer of assets without either party being able to defraud the other.As a nascent technology, DEXs currently struggle to attract the liquidity of the larger centralized exchanges, which makes them less attractive. But with Binance having launched a beta version, there is likely to be rapid development in this space.Meanwhile, Boston-based startup Arwen has launched a protocol that would give investors access to the matching engines of large centralized exchanges but allows them to retain custody through a smart contract solution that locks up their coins in escrow. KuCoin has integrated a beta version of the technology into its exchange.Even if decentralized exchanges and self-custody trading can help crypto-to-crypto transactions stay out of the regulatory net, they won’t solve the related problem of access to fiat currency. For the moment, that’s a service that has been almost solely provided by regulated, centralized exchanges.The solution lies with the new batch of stablecoins, where dollar-pegged tokens such MakerDAO’s algorithmic solution, Dai, are competing with reserves-backed stablecoins such as those of Gemini, Paxos and a consortium led by Circle and Coinbase.In theory, there’s nothing technical stopping these stable-value tokens from moving in and out of unidentified self-custody wallets, which offers a way around the fiat on-ramp problem by enabling access to de facto dollars, if not actual dollars. Only when users redeem them for actual greenbacks via the token-issuing companies will they drop into a regulated environment and have to identify themselves.Now, all these services must be underpinned by real fiat resources, which means that stablecoin providers and DEX software providers will still need bank accounts. And given banks’ ongoing reluctance to support cryptocurrency businesses, obtaining them could be a potential obstacle to startups looking to grow of this ecosystem.In this way, banks could continue to be the wedge with which regulators impose limits on the otherwise unregulated cryptocurrency industry.But as I’ve argued elsewhere , banks’ growing interest in other blockchain developments, such as in making markets in tokenized equity and bond offerings, is going to induce them to support tokenized payments. This will eventually demand a more friendly approach to some of these service providers, especially stablecoins.Most banks won’t want to cede the future of digital fiat payments to a competing bank such as JPMorgan , and they’ll be reluctant to let Facebook turn its more than 2 billion active users into an instant global payment network that bypasses banks. Ironically, that could draw them closer to rebel providers of these self-custody-enabling services.The Tom and Jerry show will continue, in other words.

with plans to launch physically-settled bitcoin futures products.","May 13, 2019 at 14:24 UTC",Bitcoin futures exchange Bakkt announced Monday that it is moving forward with plans to launch physically-settled bitcoin futures products.,"In a blog post, Bakkt CEO Kelly Loeffler wrote that Bakkt had “worked closely” with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the regulatory agency in charge of overseeing derivatives products in the country, and would be testing its bitcoin futures contracts this summer.No launch date was announced, and indeed, Loeffler did not explicitly say that the company’s proposal to self-custody its bitcoin and clear through its parent company’s warehouse (Intercontinental Exchange’s ICE Clear US) had been approved.Rather, Bakkt, through ICE, will self-certify its bitcoin futures products, meaning that the CFTC will have to assess whether or not the proposals violate any laws or regulations. If the regulator does not find any issues within a 10-day deadline, the products will move forward.This is different from asking the CFTC to explicitly approve a product, which Bakkt was previously said to be doing. CME and Cboe both self-certified their bitcoin futures contracts when they were first announced in 2017.However, unlike CME and Cboe’s products, Bakkt will deliver actual bitcoin, rather than the cash equivalent, upon a contract’s expiration.The company did not announce a final launch date, but should be able to proceed should the CFTC not raise any objections.According to the CFTC’s Rules and Rule Amendments webpage, the regulator has 10 business days to review the proposed products.ICE published two documents Monday, detailing the listing and self-certification of its two new products.In the blog post, Loeffler wrote that “we’ll be working with our customers over the next several weeks to prepare for user acceptance testing (UAT) for futures and custody, which we expect to start in July.”“We expect to use UAT to ensure that customers have time to onboard and can test the trading and custody model we’ve built to their satisfaction,” she wrote, adding that future details will be shared in upcoming posts.Still, Loeffler shared some new information about Bakkt’s upcoming products.For one thing, the firm will list two different futures contracts: a daily settlement bitcoin future, “which will enable customers to transact in a same-day market,” and a monthly futures contract. This is different from the one-day futures contract that the platform originally announced.Specifically, the firm’s new products will be:Bakkt will also place $35 million of its own funding into the clearinghouse risk waterfall, which “puts our own ‘skin in the game’ and aligns our interests for market integrity and safety with market participants,” Loeffler wrote.In addition, Bakkt plans to use its own qualified custodian to provide custody services, though this remains subject to regulatory approval.Part of this effort will revolve around Bakkt’s efforts to secure a trust company license with the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), rather than secure a federal license.UPDATE (May 13, 15:40 UTC): This article has been updated with additional details.Kelly Loeffler image via CoinDesk archives"

So. Jun 13, 2019 at 04:00 UTC.","Jun 13, 2019 at 04:00 UTC",New research from mobile mesh networking company goTenna explores how mobile communications can be decentralized with the help of bitcoin’s lightning network.,"Technologists have long explored how to use cryptocurrencies and blockchains to build programs where users are more in control of their data. GoTenna, the company behind mesh network devices for internet-less connections, is exploring a novel approach.To that end, the GoTenna team has released a new paper describing how decentralized mesh networks for sending “mobile communications” (such as text messages) could be powered by bitcoin micropayments. What’s more, they’ve establised a new subsidiary Global Mesh Labs LLC to move forward with this goal.“80 billion mobile messages are sent each day via carriers and [Internet Service Providers (ISPs)]. Mobile mesh networks offer an anti-fragile, decentralized alternative that can extend connectivity to places centralized networks can’t,” the project website argues.One hurdle to mesh network adoption is that people aren’t really incentivized to run the infrastructure required to relay data across the network, the paper argues. GoTenna attempts to fix that by describing a new “trust-minimized” protocol with bitcoin’s lightning at the center, called Lot49, which would pay users for relaying data.“Any node can earn a reward for relaying data for others and by being at the right place at the right time,” the paper, written by goTenna engineer Richard Myers, explains.The proposal is reliant on a couple of bitcoin proposals that have been widely discussed, but haven’t yet been incorporated: Schnorr and sighash_noinput. Before building and trying out the protocol, these things will need to be added, if the bitcoin community agrees that they are good changes to make.One is Schnorr, a much-anticipated, new bitcoin signature scheme that was first proposed years ago, and has seen progress recently through the release of test code.“To reduce incentive protocol overhead we propose using signature aggregation, simplex payment channel updates and payment channels formed between mesh nodes within direct communication range,” the paper explains.Light garland image via Shutterstock"

It is worth noting that futures were listed on the CME at the height of the bull market in December 2017. The futures trading activity, however, remained dull throughout 2018, courtesy of the bear market.CME Futures Market – Daily Snapshot
As seen previously, bitcoin futures usually “fill” a gap created by the close of the trading period at the end of the week with a resumption of trade on the following Monday. Large demand in futures contracts usually creates bigger gaps (from the time of close to a new open for the week), thereby risking greater draw down once prices correct.The gaps shown on the CME bitcoin futures daily chart for May 17 and May 31 provide a good example of this.On May 17 the spot price of bitcoin dropped to as low as $6,600 before greater buying pressure pushed prices back above $7,300, completing the 11.74 percent gap left in the futures market four days prior.Again on May 31, after climbing to as high as $9,090 on the Coinbase exchange, BTC’s price retraced 11 percent below $8,000 before resuming its bullish trend, pushing back above $8,200 an hour later and completing the 5.5 percent gap left in the futures market, again, four days prior.Lastly, the latest $145 gap left from yesterday’s close and today’s open created the possibility for a correction to roughly $8,595, which came in to effect early this morning as bitcoin’s price fell below $8,400 on most exchanges.Data from the CFTC also showed open interest in short positions sat at 85.1 percent compared to 62.9 percent for bitcoin longs, hinting at a price pullback in the short-term as investors side with the possibility for a downward move in its price.Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency at the time of writingBitcoin image via Shutterstock; charts via Trading View"

Though the idea has been around since before CoinDesk first covered the idea in January, this paper describes the idea in greater technical detail.Dryja is known for being one of the most prominent technologists behind the “lightning” idea, that bitcoin can scale significantly if transactions are pushed to a second layer. Several groups of developers are working to implement the technology for bitcoin payments, though it’s still experimental and not completely safe to use.Utreexo has a similar motivation, which boils down to making bitcoin full nodes easier to run. Though they take some computing resources to set up, they’re the most secure way of using bitcoin, without needing to trust a middleman to verify that transactions on the network are real.“As the number of users of the system increases, the UTXO set grows, and the resource cost of running a node increases. This has led to a progressively smaller proportion of users running their own node as more users rely on light clients or on [third] party nodes to inform them of the state of the network,” the paper explains.As such, the paper outlines a way that nodes could use cryptographic proofs to store less data without compromising on security. “Nodes using the accumulator need only store a logarithmically sized representation of the UTXO set, greatly reducing storage space and disk seek times,” the paper states.The paper also reveals the results of simulations Dryja has run showing the benefits of the scheme.”Since January I’ve implemented more code and made the code public on GitHub, and gotten performance numbers for bitcoin mainnet download sizes,” he told CoinDesk.Though, looking at these numbers, there is a small catch: although the storage requirements decrease overall, the proofs data increases the network bandwidth load.“In our simulations of downloading Bitcoin’s blockchain up to early 2019 with 500MB of RAM allocated for caching, the proofs only add approximately 25% to the amount otherwise downloaded,” the paper explains.If other developers want to take a look and pick it apart for themselves, Dryja told CoinDesk he released the code as open source so developers can test out the idea.“It’s not integrated into a wallet yet, which will still take some time, but the library is there for people to try out,” he remarked.Image via CoinDesk archives"

Last year he called it “rat poison squared” and said it was a nonproductive asset.When asked at this month’s meeting if he’d ever be involved in the technology, he replied: “I wouldn’t be the person to be a big leader in blockchain.”Warren Buffett image via Shutterstock"

Events · Latest · Opinion ...","May 29, 2019 at 16:00 UTC",The world’s biggest social media company appears dead-set on launching its own cryptocurrency.,"Facebook has yet to announce much on its plans publicly, but media reports on its crypto ambitions have emerged over the past six months, painting a partial picture of how the social network wants to capitalize on blockchain technology.In short, a team led by former PayPal president David Marcus is building an asset-backed cryptocurrency, one designed to operate within the company’s existing messaging infrastructure (WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook Messenger).The only facts arising directly from the company come from Laura McCracken, Facebook’s head of financial services and payment partnerships for Northern Europe, who told German magazine WirtschaftsWoche on June 4 that a white paper for the token would be published on June 18. She also said the token will not be tied to any single fiat currency, but will instead be linked to a basket of currencies.However, indications that Mark Zuckerberg’s company wanted to diversify into fintech first materialized as far back as 2017.Below is a full telling of what is known so far about Facebook’s cryptocurrency.(Editor’s note: This piece will be updated as new details emerge.)Looking back, the first sign that Facebook was prepared to be very serious about distributed ledger technology came in December 2017, when David Marcus joined Coinbase’s board of directors.At the time, Marcus was the vice president of messaging products at Facebook. This would have included two of the biggest messaging platforms in the world, Messenger and WhatsApp (which Facebook acquired in February 2014 for $19 billion).Though giants in their category, neither of Facebook’s messengers have the payments functionality enjoyed by their top rival: China’s WeChat.But Marcus was president of PayPal, the U.S.’s leading online payments company. He’s no stranger to solving this category of tech problems.More importantly, the next clue that Facebook intended to take crypto seriously came in August 2018, when CoinDesk first reported that Marcus was leaving Coinbase’s board.Marcus had been reassigned to focus on blockchain in May 2018. At the time, a Coinbase spokesperson told CoinDesk that Marcus had stepped down to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest.In December 2018, Bloomberg reported that Facebook intended to build a stablecoin. Stablecoins are a controversial kind of cryptocurrency that have comparably frictionless settlements as classic cryptocurrencies, without the price volatility.Long thought to be impossible without excessive centralization (and perhaps even then), they became one of the hottest forms of cryptocurrency last year, as the most popular – Tether’s USDT – faced significant headwinds and investors poured resources into competitors such as Ampleforth, TrueUSD and the ill-fated Basis.At that time, Facebook’s entry was reported as a WhatsApp-centered product, primarily focused on India. That might have only been part of it, or Menlo Park’s ambitions might have since expanded.One source that had visited Facebook told CoinDesk that any doubts about whether the company wanted to do a stablecoin should be set aside. The same source told CoinDesk to look for Facebook to roll out the project with a broad group of noted cryptocurrency companies and leaders backing it, in order to allay doubts that it might be overly centralized.The next month, the New York Times reported that Facebook wanted to unify Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger. No doubt there are many strategic reasons to do this, but for person-to-person payments it also maximizes the universe of people that can exchange the company’s new cryptocurrency.Early in February, Cheddar broke the news that Facebook had acquired a British blockchain company called Chainspace. Cheddar reported this as an “acqui-hire.” That is, it was more about hiring the people than acquiring Chainspace as a business.That said, Facebook had also been acquiring talent the old-fashioned way: with a slew of blockchain-related job postings in early 2019.Shortly thereafter, rumors swirled that Facebook was seeking investors to back its crypto efforts. Many Silicon Valley investors CoinDesk spoke to at the time had “heard” that Facebook was raising money, but details were sparse – especially given the exhaustive scope of Facebook’s non-disclosure practices.At the end of the month, the first hints about timing came out. Those dates have since been pushed back, but readers also got a sense for how the company was operating.Multiple sources have confirmed to CoinDesk that the social media giant really only talks about its blockchain efforts behind closed doors in Menlo Park, physically, and only after everyone involved has signed non-disclosure agreements.Four people that had been briefed on the matter told the New York Times in February that Facebook had already spoken with leading crypto exchanges. In May, Coinbase and Gemini were specifically cited by the Financial Times as two Facebook had discussed listings with.Another major development was Facebook’s announcement of a pivot to privacy, fully articulated by CEO Mark Zuckerberg at the company’s annual F8 event for developers.“I believe it should be as easy to send money to someone as it is to send a photo,” Zuckerberg was quoted as saying during his presentation.While not directly a cryptocurrency announcement, it does fit into the larger story. Zuckerberg described a future for Facebook where the public news feed is no longer the site’s main attraction. In fact, the site could become primarily a platform for millions of private conversations.If this happens, however, end-to-end encrypted content would make targeted ads less feasible. By controlling a new kind of money, Facebook could establish monetizable experiences that could make up for lost advertising revenue.It’s worth remembering, though, that a full 98 percent of Facebook’s $40 billion in revenue came from advertising in 2017. In March, a Barclays analyst said Facebook’s cryptocurrency could earn the company anywhere from $3 billion to $19 billion by 2021.The rumors about Facebook seeking funding for the project first entered the public sphere in a tweet from Nathaniel Popper, a New York Times reporter.But then the Wall Street Journal substantiated the claim in early May, indicating that Facebook was looking further afield than just venture capitalists. Facebook had met with payments firms such as Western Union and Visa, the Journal reported.Meanwhile, Congress began to take notice of Facebook’s efforts and the company subsequently picked up two compliance professionals from Coinbase, with significant prior experience in banking and payments.Other names started becoming publicly associated with the project, with CoinDesk breaking the news that a notable crypto-economist, MIT’s Christian Catalini, has taken a role at the company.Then Reuters found that the social media giant had registered a company in Switzerland, Libra Networks, with Facebook Global Holdings as its stakeholder.The name referenced what the Wall Street Journal had previously identified as a codename for the effort, “Project Libra.” That registration can be seen here, though it simply describes a company working on a combination of financial services products, with blockchain as a component.Le Temps reported that the person helming Libra also runs Facebook in Switzerland, Majella Goss, which operates out of a Geneva coworking space.Beyond the GlobalCoin moniker, the BBC reported that testing should begin by the end of this year and the currency itself should roll out in the first quarter of 2020.Borrowing from the playbook of the Asian e-commerce stablecoin Terra, the BBC story suggests Facebook will seek discounts from online retailers for customers who use GlobalCoin. This could be mutually beneficial both to the retailers and Facebook, as payment services provided by credit card companies come with fees that eat into e-tailers’ profit margins.Reports in early June suggest Facebook may be getting close to launching its cryptocurrency.According to a June 2 Financial Times report, Facebook has been in talks with the U.S. Commodity and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to see if its stablecoin would fall under the regulator’s remit.Then a June 5 report from The Information claimed that Facebook’s digital token is expected to be unveiled in a matter of weeks.Corresponding with previous reports from as early as December 2018, The Information said Facebook’s cryptocurrency will be “designed to function as a borderless currency without transaction fees and will be aggressively marketed in developing nations where government-backed currencies are more volatile.”Subsequent reporting by CNBC listed key staffers involved in the project.On June 14, the Wall Street Journal reported that Facebook had lined up more than a dozen big-name companies – including Visa, MasterCard, PayPal and Uber – to invest $10 million each in a consortium that would govern Global Coin.The report citing anonymous sources came days ahead of the anticipated white paper release.On the same day, the Financial Times said Facebook has hired Standard Chartered bank’s managing director for group public and regulatory affairs, Edward Bowles, who will join in September. The piece added that former U.K. deputy prime minister Nick Clegg had joined the effort in January to head the global affairs and communications team.Facebook image via Tobias Dziuba/Pexels"

network (as opposed to a test one), allowing transactions of real BTC.","Apr 30, 2019 at 13:00 UTC",Japanese startup Nayuta is releasing an in-progress lightning implementation with a compelling new focus: the internet of things (IoT).,"As revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, Nayuta is publishing the first lightning implementation geared specifically toward IoT, or networks of connected devices that feed data to one another. The idea behind Nayuta’s release is that it connects to bitcoin’s live network (as opposed to a test one), allowing transactions of real BTC.To date, Nayuta’s release represents the fourth lightning implementation to officially launch on bitcoin’s mainnet so far, following software pushes from startups Acinq, Blockstream, and Lightning Labs.Called Ptarmigan, the Japanese word for “thunder bird,” the name plays off the fact that the promising bitcoin technology it builds upon is named “lightning.”The startup view micropayments as a major element for the budding Internet of Things industry, which has attracted attention from many big name firms. Some of those companies are investing time and resources at the intersection of blockchain and IoT, and while there’s not one clear direction for how the tech can be integrated into connected device networks, recent headlines make it clear that significant industries are getting involved.The idea behind one aspect — as demonstrated by Jaguar’s IOTA experiment as well as work by startups like Nayuta, is that IoT devices will be capable of making small payments to one another. In the case of lightning, such micropayments could be conducted using bitcoin.As Nayuta co-founder Kenichi Kurimoto explained to CoinDesk:“The lightning network has the following promising characteristics: (a) small transaction amounts, or “micropayments” (b) borderless and cross-domain payments (c) real-time payments (d) large transaction per second (TPS) potential. Especially the combination (a) & (b) has the potential to create a whole new market. Because humans do not want to make payment-action many times, it is required to link with other actions performed by many people or with some kind of autonomous actions.”Nayuta partnered with a major electric Japanese company last year to put lightning payments to the test for recharging electric cars. But while this is also a vision shared by larger companies like Qualcomm Ventures, thus far, these ideas haven’t taken off at a large scale, perhaps partly because bitcoin’s micropayment technology is still under-developed.But Nayuta is trying to put the idea to the test. Soon to follow is a device they call a lightning “shield.” Arduino’s are little computers used mostly by hobbyists to create robots or other technology. “Shields” add extra functionality, from motors for making things spin or better sound. a new type of technology that can be clipped onto an Arduino board.“It means dramatically increasing the number of people who can develop prototypes of IoT applications that use Lightning Network feature,” Kurimoto said, adding:“IoT is one of the important Lightning Network application area, but no one knows what the killer-app is. In such situation, an increasing number of developers and prototyping trials are very important.”But this one adds lightning functionality, or the ability for said device to send or receive small payments.“Our long-term goal is to make Ptarmigan the small-footprint lightning network software that operates on small hardware. This mainnet version experimentally implements an SPV wallet mode with which it operates on an independent node on Raspberry Pi Zero,” Nayuta said in a press release.“SPV,” which stands for simplified payment verification, is a small lightning node on the network that requires an end-user to download less data. A Raspberry Pi Zero is possibly the cheapest computer to date, costing a mere $5.To show how it works, Nayuta has released a short demo video, showing how they sent a lightning transaction over their new lightning shield, causing a strip of lights to shine.Lightning strikes image via Shutterstock"

He also claimed to be selling the cryptocurrency on various cryptocurrency exchanges.As a result, in Wednesday’s ruling, Kelly said that, of the 288 bitcoins, she was “not satisfied” that 7.23 bitcoins (worth around $36,000) were proceeds of crime and that they would not be forfeited.Phan, whose computer holding the bitcoins was seized in 2015, is yet to be sentenced.Handcuffs and bitcoin image via Shutterstock "

Bloom to explain why he shouldn’t be held in contempt. @KyleWRoche— Vel Freedman (@VelvelFreedman) June 21, 2019Florida judge Bruce Reinhart had ordered Craig Wright, who claims to have invented the bitcoin software, to disclose his bitcoin addresses in an ongoing lawsuit filed by the estate of his former business partner, David Kleiman.Ira Kleiman, Dave’s brother, on behalf of the Kleiman estate accused the Australian entrepreneur of scheming to seize a shared holding of bitcoin the two mined together between 2009 and 2011, as well as Kleiman’s intellectual property. The plaintiff seeks the return of half of a 1.1 million bitcoin stockpile, allegedly held in the “Tulip Trust,” which Wright claimed consolidated bitcoin he mined and purchased between 2009 and 2011.According to a court declaration filed on May 8, Wright said seven trustees were named, including Craig Wright, David Kleiman, and Ms. Uyen Nguyen — whom Wright claimed he has had no contact with since 2016. Wright has also said in the past, “Access to the encrypted file that contains the public addresses and their associated private keys to the Bitcoin that I mined, requires myself and combination of trustees reference in Tulip Trust I to unlock based on Shamir scheme.”In the declaration, Wright also pointed to the existence of bitcoin mined under his direction at by staff at HighSecured and Signia Enterprises. Wright said this stockpile is also inaccessible.The existence of a previously unknown second Tulip Trust – to which Equater Consultants is named a trustee – also come to light in the court document.It is unknown how the Federal court has ascertained the existence of bitcoin holdings not previously disclosed by Wright. A transcript of a hearing held on June 11 before Judge Reinhart is under seal, along with the bitcoin listings Wright has provided.Stephen Palley, a lawyer who has followed the case closely but does not represent either party, said, “This is a huge pressure point in settlement negotiations which may or may not be happening.”Here's the deal — Wright could actually be held in contempt, civil or criminal.

resistance range of 53.00–55.00, validating the longer-term bullish ...","Apr 22, 2019 at 11:00 UTC","With a widely-followed price indicator now signaling a long-term bullish reversal, bitcoin (BTC) could extend its recent rally to $6,000 over the next couple of months.","Notably, the 14-week relative strength index (RSI) – an indicator used to identify overbought or oversold conditions – has found acceptance above the key 53.00–55.00 resistance range, which had served as strong support in the 2015–2017 bull market.Essentially, the indicator has jumped back to bull market territory, reinforcing the longer term bullish reversal first confirmed by bitcoin’s violation of a bearish lower highs and lower lows pattern on April 2.As a result, BTC may challenge the former support-turned-resistance of $6,000 in the near term.As of writing, the crypto market leader is changing hands near $5,300 on Bitstamp, representing a 0.20 percent gain on a 24-hour basis. Prices have been largely restricted to $4,900–$5,500 range since April 3 and may see a pullback before prices rise to $6,000.As seen above (left), the 14-week RSI has found acceptance above the resistance range of 53.00-55.00.While a reading above 50 indicates bullish conditions, the weekly RSI established the 53.00-55.00 range as the make-or-break level during the 2.5-year bull market that topped out in December 2017 at a record high of $20,000.At no point during the bull market were the bears strong enough to push the RSI below 53.00. Further, the RSI’s break below 53.00 in January 2018 was followed by a bear market that saw prices slide to lows near $3,100 by December.Also, note how the RSI’s repeated rejection of attempts to climb back above 53.00 in the five months to October 2018 was followed by a high-volume drop below $6,000 on Nov. 14.So, with RSI now having found acceptance above 55.00, the longer-term bearish-to-bullish trend change confirmed by a falling channel breakout two weeks ago looks to have legs, and BTC could rise to the former support-turned-resistance of $6,000 over the next couple of months.Backing that argument are the 5- and 10-week moving averages (MAs), which are sloping upwards in favor of the bulls for the first time since early December 2017. These bullish averages, currently located at $5,045 and $4,505, may act as brakes on any pullbacks going forward.Signs of bullish exhaustion have emerged on the daily chart. For instance, BTC created a doji candle on Friday and remained more or less flat-lined over the weekend. The case for a deeper pullback, however, would strengthen only if the recent low of $4,934 is breached.A break below that level cannot be ruled out, as markets often test the bulls’ resolve immediately after a major breakout. For instance, the 100-day MA hurdle, which was breached on Feb. 19, was put to test multiple times in the 10 days to March 4 before a sustained move higher.On similar lines, BTC may revisit the 200-day MA, currently at $4,482, before rising further.The cryptocurrency, however, may pick up a bid in the next 24 hours, if the bearish pattern seen in the chart below is violated.Currently, BTC is flirting with the upper edge of a bearish channel, having invalidated both a bearish divergence of the RSI and a falling wedge breakdown with repeated defense of support at $5,170 last week.The channel breakout, therefore, looks likely and could be followed by a retest of the recent high of $5,466.On the downside, a break below $5,170 would shift risk in favor of a drop to the recent low of $4,912.Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.Bitcoin image via Shutterstock; charts by Trading View"

Once transferred, Gift and Usifoh would exchange it for their local currency, Nigerian naira.In over six months, the defendants stole 10.88 bitcoins (worth approximately $56,391 at press time) from three victims, one residing in Oregon and two in California, according to the indictment. They also used a photo of a fourth victim to promote their scheme.In total, the prosecutors allege Gift and Usifoh received more than 50 bitcoins ($259,000) through the scam.Largely due to their pseudonymous, online nature, cryptocurrencies are becoming increasingly popular as a means to scam investors. But law enforcement is catching up.Last month, New York prosecutors charged a man in a nine-count indictment for duping investors out of over $200,000 in cryptocurrency and cash.

mining as an industry that needs to be “eliminated.” But even if ...","Apr 11, 2019 at 02:15 UTC",The Takeaway:,"One of these things is not like the others.On Sept. 4, 2017, the People’s Bank of China (PBoC), together with six other central government agencies and financial regulators, banned initial coin offerings (ICOs). Later that month, regulators ordered the country’s bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchanges to shut down. And on April 8 of this year, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), China’s top macroeconomic planner and one of 26 cabinet-level agencies which form the State Council, published a draft proposal to amend the Catalog for Guiding Industrial Restructure.The proposed revision, still pending public consultation, classifies “virtual currency mining, such as the production process of bitcoin” as an industry category that’s undesirable and to be eliminated, together with hundreds of other sectors. The news was widely covered, with most media outlets leaping to the conclusion that China now wants to ban cryptocurrency mining, just as it did in 2017 with ICOs and domestic spot trading.But to call this policy a “ban” in the same sense is misleading at best. The reality is more nuanced, and requires additional context to fully understand.Below, CoinDesk takes a close look at the history of the NDRC’s policy recommendations to clarify what this latest guidance really means – and why it does not automatically amount to an outright ban. The NDRC first published its catalog in 2005, grouping industrial sectors into three types – those the agency advises the country to encourage, restrict or eliminate. It defined those to be eliminated as industries that have obsolete techniques, products, and technology, or which are unlawful, unsafe, wasteful or pollutive.The purpose of the catalog is to serve as a macro-level economic policy to guide local governments on how to allocate their investment and resources to balance local economic growth with overall stability. To give such policy a legal status, the State Council promulgated an “Interim Provisions on Promoting Industrial Structure Adjustment” for implementation in December 2005. According to a translation by LexisNexis (full document included at the end of this article), Article 19 of the Interim Provisions clarifies what local governments shall do with industries that are categorized as to be eliminated.“[Government] Investments are prohibited from being contributed to projects of the eliminated category. All financial institutions shall stop various forms of credit granting supports to such projects, and take measures to recover the granted loans,” the Article reads, adding:“If any enterprise of the eliminated category refuses to eliminate the production technique, equipment or products, the local people’s government at each level and the relevant administrative department shall, in accordance with the relevant laws and regulations of the state, order it to stop production or close it.”Therefore, indeed, local governments are required to take proper actions to implement what’s outlined in the NDRC’s policy guide. But there’s a notable catch: the part about “the relevant laws and regulations of the state.”Kai Xu, a legal practitioner in China with expertise in corporate governance and compliance, explained to CoinDesk that local governments must use related laws and regulations – not the Interim Provisions itself – as a legal basis to take forceful actions to shut down “undesirable” companies. For instance, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce recently published a provision for administrative penalty when regulating businesses like internet advertising and e-commerce. It outlines who is entitled to take forceful administrative actions against companies violating regulations, what the penalties are and how they should be carried out.“Because such an action is an administrative penalty, it must have a legal ground first,” Xu said. “It’s currently unclear [how or what types of laws bitcoin mining should fall under].”He added that the legal nature of the NDRC’s policy is different from that of the ICO ban announced by the central bank in 2017 (which clearly defined the nature of ICOs as an illegal activity, meaning any entity that still engages in that activity is subject to legal actions). “The former is an industry policy and the latter is a departmental regulatory document,” he said. Also importantly, the State Council emphasized at the top of the 2005 Interim Provisions that local governments, when implementing the industrial policy, are also required to balance the government guidance and the functions of the market as well as local interests. It states:“The relevant governments and departments shall, when implementing the ‘Interim Provisions’, correctly deal with the relationship between government guidance and market regulation, give full play to the fundamental role of the market in allocating resources, correctly deal with the relationship between development and stability, that between partial interests and overall interests, and that between immediate interests and long-term interests, so as to keep the stable and fast development of the economy.”Xu told CoinDesk that if the final form of the policy guide includes bitcoin mining as a category to be eliminated, it will be the job of local governments and relevant departments to implement actual executional plans.But he also pointed out there is always the possibility that a policy will not be enforced or implemented in the end, adding:“There are many reasons to that, since executions are carried out by human beings, after all. And there may also be information costs during implementation, as well as conflicts with local interest.” And members of the local mining community have also raised questions about whether it’s reasonable to label bitcoin mining as an industry to be eliminated, arguing that such a decision could potentially conflict with local interest. Alex Ao, founder of Innosilicon, which manufactures cryptocurrency mining equipment, said in China’s Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang and southwestern provinces like Sichuan and Yunnan, there is excessive electricity generated every year that can neither be fully consumed by local demand nor be integrated to the State Grid to be transmitted to regions outside.For instance, the Garze prefecture government in Sichuan has said that in 2017 alone, hydropower plants in the area generated 41.5 billion kilowatt hours (kWh) of electricity thanks to the rainy season in the summer. But a total excess of 16.3 billion kWh went to waste due to not enough local consumption, which resulted in a direct economic loss of some 4 billion yuan, or $600 million, for local hydropower companies. Tyler Xiong, chief marketing officer of Bixin, which operates a mining pool and wallet service, echoed that sentiment.“First, bitcoin mining doesn’t result in pollution. It actually helps consume excessive electricity [generated by local plants] that would otherwise go to waste. And it creates jobs and revenue locally,” he said. “Eliminating that could conflict with local interest because it can benefit the local economy.”The public now has until May 7 to submit feedback on the NDRC draft proposal. While it’s unclear when the final version will be published, the draft comes at a time when Chinese bitcoin miners have been investing to scale up their mining capacity to capture on the cheap electricity during the summer.It’s worth noting that the NDRC had published and revised the policy guide multiple times over the past decade. What happened to some of the industries that were previously labeled as to be eliminated? While it is difficult to grasp a full picture of the actual implementation over the years, one article from the People’s Daily in 2006 described certain issues local governments in Hebei encountered when eliminating energy-intensive sectors such as cement manufacturing, following the 2005 policy guide.The article cited a comment from an official from the NDRC, explaining the policy guide was not a legal basis for taking forceful actions to shut down companies. “It must be done in accordance to relevant laws,” the official said, a point echoed by Xu above. In the cement-making instance, the article said most local governments used laws and regulations relating to land resources and environment management as a legal basis for taking actions.And there are also examples where certain items were first marked for elimination, but later removed from the category, thanks to feedback gathered during implementation.For example, in 2011, the production equipment for manufacturing cold-rolled ribbed bar (a material used in construction) was classified as a sector that should be eliminated. In a revised version in 2013, the NDRC adjusted the wording to specify that only certain types of cold-rolled ribbed bar equipment with productivity below a threshold should be eliminated. The NDRC explained in a separate note that the reason for the revision was because during implementation, the industry had provided feedback that there was still a considerable amount of domestic demand for cold-rolled ribbed bar making. After gathering and studying such feedback with relevant government departments, the Commission agreed that some equipment with higher productivity and efficiency should be kept.None of this is to downplay the attitude shown in the policy guide from the NDRC, which clearly voices a stance of not supporting cryptocurrency mining in China. Yet the main questions that are now in the air is whether the final form of the policy will still include bitcoin mining in the “undesirable” category, and if so, how lawmakers and local governments will carry out the implementation – especially when it conflicts with potential local interest.Interim Provisions on Promoting Industrial Structure Adjustment by CoinDesk on ScribdChinese mining farm image via CoinDesk archive"

But its rotation period is three years, and it approached the Earth many times when there were no big wars.”The Navalny wallet (3QzYvaRFY6bakFBW4YBRrzmwzTnfZcaA6E, listed on the donations page of his website) received its first bitcoin in December 2016 and since then has seen more than 2,000 transactions, including withdrawals, according to blockchain data.Most transactions were worth from a fraction of a bitcoin to several bitcoins. From time to time, larger transactions occurred, bringing in up to 20 BTC at once.Yet Navalny’s political movement, which also accepts donations via bank transfers and PayPal, is not the only dissenting voice in Russia to take cryptocurrency.Investigative outlets including Zona.Media and The Insider, as well as internet freedom movement Roskomsvoboda, accept donations in bitcoin or ether. However, their wallets have accumulated only small amounts of crypto, no more than 2 BTC each.Alexei Navalny image via Shutterstock"

Now, Braiins is moving to make its involvement with Slush Pool more obvious, in part with a redesign of its logo and all its product websites.Braiins creative director Luboš Buračinský told CoinDesk:“After running and developing Slush Pool for the last six years more or less in the background, we’re going to take a more visible public position.”With the rebrand, Braiins wants all its products to fall under one banner. “The rebranding will also unify our other products and services, including Braiins OS,” Buračinský continued.Miners need to run what’s known as “firmware” on their mining devices to monitor the performance. Braiins OS, launched September of last year, differs from other mining firmwares because it’s open-source — it’s not closed off like other proprietary firmwares.“If you own the hardware, you should be able to have full control of it without worrying about some ‘hidden features’,” the project announcement post explains.In addition, Braiins plans to release several new updates to their products in the coming months. The firm is working on a new “payout” feature for the mining pool, which would allow miners to have more control of how they get paid.Further, Braiins is “replacing the CGMiner with Rust implementation” for Braiins OS,  which would make “adding new hardware much easier,” according to the firm.Bitcoin mining stock photo image via Shutterstock"

Ragnar and Giacomo Zucco clubbing people left and right. Wat is going on!?”,"This text from a bitcoin enthusiast friend aptly described the confusion on social media platform Twitter in recent days, when leading members of the bitcoin developer and startup ecosystem have been fighting over bitcoin’s “culture” and whether it needs to be changed or improved.The root of the debate: Does bitcoin have a culture problem? Is there too much “toxicity”? And yet, as Twitter is a free-for-all, there were all sorts of sub-parts to the debate, centering on other questions: Is bitcoin inclusive enough? Why is Twitter so harsh? And what, exactly is bitcoin culture?It’s hard to say exactly how the fiery battle started, but it appears to have stemmed from a tweet from Token Daily co-founder Soona Amhaz stating: “A few bright ethereum core developers have personally confided in me that they turned to ethereum after feeling [antagonized] by the bitcoin community. Play the long game or you will lose talent.”Amidst the discussion that followed came Neil Woodfine, Blockstream’s marketing director, who argued that bitcoin’s culture can seem unwelcoming partly because there are so many fraudsters in the industry trying to make a quick buck.And those in the ecosystem who have been around for more idealistic reasons, have grown to reject this mindset in a sometimes harsh manner.“Bitcoin industry culture is therefore *necessarily* one of extreme skepticism, cynicism, rigorous review, and forthright language,” Woodfine tweeted, adding:“If you’re unhappy with bitcoin culture, sorry, you’re the problem. Bitcoin is better off without you—you’re not cut out for the challenges ahead. You’re not good under pressure, you’re too sensitive, and you lack conviction.”Others on Woodfine’s “side” of the debate (though the debate was so raw and messy it’s hard to determine actual sides) argue that bitcoin’s community has been hardened by past debates over the years. The most well-known of which was bitcoin’s scaling debate, which abruptly ended when a minority of bitcoiners broke off to create bitcoin cash.In short, the argument goes that the reason the community can come off as unwelcoming is because they’ve had to dispel many bad ideas along the way.But Woodfine’s thread, while popular, didn’t sit well with everyone.“This is gaslighting bullshit,” said Neha Narula, research director for MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative, calling Woodfine’s thread a “travesty.”This side of the debate suggests that there’s something wrong with bitcoin’s “culture,” that settling for the way things are is not enough, and that people should make more of an effort to include people in the community.“Always question, never settle, and know that there are lots of us who try to debate, criticize, learn, and improve without being jerks,” Narula went on to write.Others had similar reservations with the idea bitcoin’s culture is static, arguing that the culture isn’t set in stone.“Totally wrong. That some dudes on Twitter can declaim what bitcoin’s culture is and should forever be is ridiculous. We’re still building the culture, and we *can* make it better,” argued Chaincode developer John Newbery, leading into a conversation about how bitcoin developers aren’t a very diverse group and he wants people of various cultural backgrounds to feel more welcome.In what might have been the climax of the debate, bitcoin developer Matt Corallo blocked Blockstream CSO Samson Mow, going on to argue some individuals at the bitcoin tech startup Blockstream’s culture are “toxic.” Corallo helped to found the startup in 2014.It might seem this massive debate came out of nowhere. Tierion researcher Paul Sztorc’s take is that people in the community just didn’t have an outlet to talk about these concerns until this debate blew up.“Usually when people fight, it is because lots of unresolved stuff has been bubbling up over time. Then it is triggered by one little event — the straw that broke the camel’s back, as they say,” Sztorc argued.On that note, some participants see truth in both sides of the debate.“Some people say we should promote better culture that is more inclusive and respectful. Other people say [peer-to-peer] network protocols must remain neutral and not care about cultural issues. They are both right,” argued Ciphrex co-founder CEO Eric Lombrozo, though he later argued that Twitter culture — which he described as “mostly a bunch of dudes trying to win stupid prizes” — isn’t representative of bitcoin’s overall culture.BitTorrent creator and bitcoin developer Bram Cohen also blames the “toxicity” on the social media platform Twitter specifically.“Anyone who persists in being a jerk should eventually be made to feel unwelcome, but the default assumption should be that people simply haven’t learned the norms yet and explain it to them,” he said.Meanwhile, others drew alternative conclusions about the state of the bitcoin community from the debate.As Woodfine tweeted:“After this weekend, let no one ever again claim that bitcoin is an echo chamber.”Bitcoin Twitter image via Shutterstock"

Notably, the app is “non-custodial” meaning that users have control over their bitcoin.Authored by Lightning Labs developers Tankred Hase and Valentine Wallace, the blog post announcing the new app explains:“Driving this release is a complete commitment to scaling the principles that Bitcoin was built on: privacy, security, and self-determination. For that we need to go beyond custodial solutions and enthusiast guides and deliver a great user experience for everyone.”Other apps work with real bitcoin today, including Bluewallet, Zap, and Zeus. But Lightning Labs, originally started by lightning’s creators, is perhaps the largest company to release a bitcoin mainnet app so far.The app works on MacOS, Windows, and Linux devices.Developers revealing the app are quick to note that although this is a mainnet app, it’s still made for “advanced users” who want to test out the budding technology. There’s still a risk of losing money when sending it on what remains an unfinished technology.The other big part of the release is that behind the scenes the desktop incorporates “Neutrino,” a “light client” technology which requires users to download much less of the bitcoin blockchain in order to verify transactions are real. Though other light client technologies exist, Neutrino is more private. (Though, some developers have been known to argue about the protocol’s drawbacks.)Looking ahead, Lightning Labs is eyeballing a release on mobile devices in the future.The blog post explains that Lightning Labs has plans to move into mobile devices soon as well.“[The release] also represents an important stepping stone towards mobile while we continue to invest in performance and stability,” Hase and Wallace wrote. “We’re working as quickly as we can to get our mainnet iOS and Android apps out soon.”Lightning strike over city image via Shutterstock"

","The arrest — which occurred on March 27, 2019 — was part of a wider investigation into a Boston-based drug syndicate that operated through the darknet site EastSideHigh. During the investigation, an undercover federal agent ordered MDMA from the “EastSideHigh” vendors. Later this officer allegedly observed Binh Thanh Le, 22, deposit an envelope containing the agent’s order into a United States Postal Service collection box in Stoughton, a neighborhood in Boston.  Agents devised a sting meeting with Le, arresting him after he transferred bitcoin to the agents. It is unclear if Le collaborated with the federal agents throughout the investigation. Le’s conspirators, Steven McCall, 23, and Allante Pires, 22, were later arrested on charges of conspiring to make and distribute controlled substances, including MDMA, Ketamine, and Xanax. According to the charging documents, Le, McCall, and Pires received wholesale quantities of controlled substances in the mail. The three men then processed and manufactured those controlled substances at an office space they rented in Stoughton. Pursuant to federal search warrants, numerous envelopes containing narcotics connected to this drug distribution scheme were intercepted. The arrests were made following the execution of a search warrant at their office space. Upon entry, the agents found and arrested McCall, who was wearing latex gloves and a respirator, believed to be in the process of filling drug orders. During the search, agents found a computer with the EastSideHigh vendor page open, and numerous packages containing MDMA and Ketamine, various shipping and packaging materials, and a pill press. In total, authorities also seized 20 kilograms of MDMA, more than seven kilograms of Ketamine, over 10,000 Xanax pills, and more than $100,000 in cash.All three men were indicted yesterday in federal court in Boston on charges of conspiring to manufacture and distribute controlled substances.Postal truck fleet photo via ShutterStock"

In fact, the RSI is currently seen at 89.11, its highest level since December 2017.An overbought reading on the RSI is often taken to be a sign of impending bearish reversal. In reality, however, an above-70 print merely indicates that the rally is overdone and a reaction – a price pullback – could be in the offing.These overbought indicators become valid only when the price begins to flash early signs of buyer exhaustion, which seems to be the case with BTC.The cryptocurrency witnessed a sharp drop to $4,800 within two hours of hitting highs above $5,300 at 21:00 UTC yesterday and is now struggling to hold onto price points above $5,000.As a result, price consolidation or a deeper pullback to $4,600 could be seen in the next couple of days.The long upper shadow attached to Wednesday’s candle (above left) indicates the bullish move is running out of steam.Validating that argument is the big bearish engulfing candle seen in the 4-hour chart (lower left), which indicates that the period began with optimism but ended on a pessimistic note.Both candlesticks add credence to the extreme overbought reading on the 14-day RSI (right).On the hourly chart, the RSI has rolled over from the overbought territory, having charted lower highs over the last 48 hours, contradicting the higher highs on price.That bearish divergence also favors a price pullback to key support levels lined up at $4,672 and $4,565 (200-hour MA).Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.Bitcoin image via Shutterstock; charts by Trading View"

The Catalogue was later revised and updated in 2011, 2013, and 2016, respectively, and is undergoing another revision.The public will have until May 7 to share feedback on proposed amendments, after which the final version will be published and become effective.However, it remains to be seen whether the revised guide, if still including such categorization of bitcoin mining in its final form, will have any impact on bitcoin mining in China, since the catalog itself serves as a general direction for future development.Currently, China is still home to some of the world’s largest cryptocurrency mining equipment makers as well as mining farm operations.

There cannot be a total disregard for a central bank or a third party that provides lender of last resort facility.”To balance encouraging innovation with risk mitigation, the central bank prefers to use regulatory sandboxes to keep oversight of such new technologies, Guinigundo said.The central bank execs’ warning comes as use of cryptocurrencies in the Philippines continue to rise. The PhilStar previously reported that virtual currency transactions in the Southeast Asian nation almost doubled from $189.18 million in 2017 to $390.37 million last year, based on data compiled by the central bank’s Technology Risk and Innovation Supervision Department.Those transactions in the Philippines include conversions from Philippines pesos and other fiat currencies to cryptocurrencies and vice versa, as well as inbound international remittances facilitated through cryptocurrencies.In response to the surge in use, the central bank in February 2017 issued a  circular mandating cryptocurrency exchanges to register with the central bank as remittance and transfer companies, and further required these firms to set up safeguards to ensure consumer protection and counter illicit transactions such as money laundering and terrorist financing.The central bank stressed that it does not intend to endorse any cryptocurrency, since it is neither issued or guaranteed by a central bank or backed by a commodity. Nevertheless, the institution said it aims to regulate the tech when used for delivery of financial services, particularly for payments and remittances, to ensure consumer protection and financial stability.To date, 10 exchanges in the Philippines have been registered with the central bank.Philippines coins image via Shutterstock"

three-day chart's 100-candle moving average (MA), currently at $5,238.","Apr 16, 2019 at 11:00 UTC","The stalled bitcoin (BTC) rally could again pick up the pace if a new resistance level above $5,200 is convincingly breached.","The market-leading cryptocurrency picked up a strong bid at lows below $4,200 on April 2 and jumped to 4.5-month highs above $5,300 on April 8, confirming a bullish reversal.The rally, however, has stalled in the last few days, courtesy of overbought conditions and other factors, as discussed yesterday.Notably, the three-day chart’s 100-candle moving average (MA), currently at $5,238, has been proving a tough nut to crack since April 2. As a result, that lesser-known average is now the level to beat for the bulls.A convincing move above that MA resistance could bring in more buyers, reviving the prospects of the further rally.As of writing, bitcoin is trading at $5,080 on Bitstamp, representing a 1.5 percent drop on a 24-hour basis.The 100-candle moving average has recently been put to test for the first time since May 2018. Back then, the average was trending north, indicating a bullish setup and was located just above $8,400.As of writing, it is sloping downwards, representing a bearish bias, and is seen at $5,238. That bearish signal, however, is of little concern to the bulls, as longer duration averages are lagging indicators.That said, bitcoin has repeatedly failed to secure a three-day close above that average over the last 15 days. A break higher, therefore, may embolden the bulls and allow a sustained move higher toward $5,500.That, however, looks unlikely in the short-run, as the repeated failure at the 100-candle MA is accompanied by early signs of bearish reversal on the shorter duration charts.BTC created a bearish outside reversal candle Monday – a pattern that occurs when the day begins on an optimistic note, but ends with pessimism. The candlestick is widely considered a sign of potential trend reversal, especially when it appears after a notable rally, as is the case with BTC.Traders, however, wait for confirmation in the form of strong follow-through, preferably a close below the candle’s low.So, a UTC close below $4,948 (Monday’s low) would shift risk in favor of a deeper drop toward the ascending 30-day MA, currently at $4,550. It is worth noting that the 30-day MA served as strong support throughout last month.A bearish close below $4,948 looks likely, as the 5- and 10-day MAs have produced a bearish crossover, validating the signs of buyer exhaustion seen on the weekly chart (last week’s candle was a doji).That said, the longer duration outlook will remain bullish as long as prices are trading above $4,236.Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.Bitcoin image via Shutterstock; charts by Trading View"

More and more people are paying attention, with staking touted as the best way to make semi-passive returns in a bear market.Coinbase is launching staking support, and new staking coins are cropping up to compete with the established players like Tezos, Dash and Decred.It’s not really that simple. Staking is getting attention for all the wrong reasons, and it’s time to re-examine its role.Misconceptions around how it works and why it exists will have lasting consequences if expectations aren’t set now. Projects that implement any form of proof-of-stake (PoS) need to plan for long-term sustainability, not just the immediate future.Staking is evolving from being a semi-passive reward, to becoming a powerful incentive for participating in governance. Projects that plan for the future will figure out how to incentivize active participation, while those who elect a set of governors based on the quality of their kickbacks won’t last.Choosing to stake on the right projects for the right reasons is the best way to earn rewards.Proof-of-Work (PoW) was introduced on bitcoin as a block validation method to timestamp transactions without the need for a trusted third party. PoW has an established track record with bitcoin securing its network using energy. People began exploring PoS as a way to use less energy to do validation “work.”PoS is more accessible and decentralized, empowering coin holders, who “stake” coins to “forge” blocks by maintaining an online wallet or node.Staking started as just another method for recording transactions securely, but it’s constantly evolving. Some implementations are a hybrid with PoW, while others add delegates who either receive votes from, or are empowered to act on behalf of, the group.As Zaki Manian, co-creator of Cosmos, pointed out in an interview with CoinDesk, “[P]art of the dynamics of proof-of-stake is how frequently do people just vote to give themselves more money?”In this scenario, coin holders collect exorbitant rewards without putting in any work.Staking has been erroneously portrayed as the crypto version of a bond. While there are projects that don’t require any more work than staking funds for a reward, this approach is ultimately unsustainable and will get participants who thought they could “park and earn” into trouble.It’s not unusual for projects to employ a toothless charade for centralized parties to claim they’re not in control. These systems are often overly complicated and characterized by confusing procedures and non-binding voting, which in practice discourage voter participation and lead to voter apathy.When it comes to participation, several staking projects have voting on treasury spending — projects like Dash, Decred and PIVX are paving the way in governance where the community participates in project-level decision making. Decred’s participatory voting feature, for example, allows token holders to vote on everything from protocol decisions to choosing to hire its PR firm.Today, staking spans a gamut of implementations beyond locking up funds, from ensuring the security of a blockchain to changes in consensus rules. PoS doesn’t necessarily imply governance, but its incentive structure combined with governance has radical implications for participation.With the right incentives, staking can not only return rewards, but also give you input on a project’s future direction. When staking your coins, they usually go through a lock-up period while voting — rules on this vary from project to project.After voting, you get your coins back as well as a staking reward.If you vote against the project’s interests, while you’ll still get the immediate staking reward, over time you’ll feel the negative market effects of bad decisions like an all-expenses-paid stakeholder’s ski trip to Switzerland. In a system that gamifies decision-making and other processes, voting on decisions has a longer-lasting effect beyond earning an immediate staking reward.Staking governance is powerful because it embodies a philosophical underpinning of the crypto movement: the belief humanity’s accepted forms of large-scale decision-making aren’t working well.Staking aims to put that into practice — in crypto in the near term and on a societal scale in the distant future. This means eliminating corrupt intermediaries in favor of peer-to-peer interaction, and shirking representative democracy in favor of direct voting.Individual sovereignty is tantamount; if you have skin in the game (i.e. are financially invested), you should help determine the direction of that game. But with that comes the responsibility of making informed decisions, and not necessarily trusting anyone else is going to make them for you. If you want to participate in staking long-term, you need to understand a project well enough to stake it.If you want to have a say in how a project is run, you need to stake one that incorporates your sovereignty as a user. To participate, you need to keep up on changes to its consensus rules and actively vote for what you believe is best for it.Staking can yield significant rewards, but to simply receive compensation for voting sets up a poor alignment structure. Coin holders must understand the responsibility that comes with locking up their coins and use it wisely — and only then enjoy the fruits of their labor.Poker chips via Shutterstock"

Shay is co-founder and chairman of Signature Bank of New York and the author of In Good Faith: Questioning Religion and Atheism (Post Hill Press, 2018).","Allowing Facebook to mint its own coin, the Libra, would turn it into the greatest anti-competitive trust case in history. It would make the early 20th century Morgans or Rockefellers seem downright competitive.Even before it unveiled its vision for a global cryptocurrency this month, Facebook was already a near-monopoly in social media, and part of a duopoly in its main markets. Together with Google, it controls 82% of the digital advertising market.  In the past, Facebook has purchased any company that threatened it, e.g. Instagram and WhatsApp. And, when it spots a company that won’t sell itself or would be difficult to purchase, it uses the “embrace, enhance and extinguish” technique.  Facebook saw Snap Inc. (maker of Snapchat) contesting a small part of its franchise, so it embraced Snap’s best features and integrated them into its app. Now, Facebook is hoping to extinguish Snap as a competitor. Compare the stock performance of Snap and Facebook, and you will probably place your bet on Facebook. But it is not simply Facebook’s business practices that are of concern.  Neither Facebook nor Google charges for their consumer products, obscuring the fact that all-encompassing consumer tracking is their real product. In many cases, their data is better than what the KGB or CIA could have gathered 20 years ago. And their data is certainly a lot cheaper, since it is voluntarily provided and easily accessible. We would not want our government agencies to have this sort of power, nor should we want it to be in the hands of corporations. Facebook and Google have already shown their political muscle. With their duopoly on digital marketing advertising, these companies have transformed the nature of news.  Only a few news sites, such as The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times, can resist their gravitational pull and still attract direct advertisers as well as subscribers.  Most other publications must use Google ads, which provide far less revenue to the outlet, slice and dice their readership, and force newspapers to write clickbait. Ads to readers are so well-placed because of the mountain of information that can be inputted into their algorithms. The same holds true for news content viewed on Facebook. Now, with the Libra project, Facebook wants to exponentially increase its monopolistic power by accessing unparalleled information about our consumer purchasing habits. If allowed to proceed with Libra, a company that knows your every mood and virtually controls the news you see will also have access to the deepest insights into your spending patterns. Of course, Facebook will speak piously about privacy controls and its concern for the consumer, yet it will still figure out a way to sell the data or others who buy the data will figure it out for them. Furthermore, with the richness of the social media data Facebook consistently garners, even anonymized data can be recalibrated to distill specific individual-related information and preferences. Facebook, along with its other monopolist rent-seeking cohorts, such as eBay, Uber and Mastercard, all say they won’t do that.  Quite frankly, there is zero reason to believe such promises. Their culture is based strictly on brand concerns and access to personal data. Additionally, hacks of social media are now so common that we are inured to them. Consumers can have the benefit of a digital payment mechanism without allowing Facebook to gain more power. In the financial services sector, my institution, Signature Bank, was the first to introduce a 24/7 blockchain-enabled payment system. As one would expect, others, such as JPMorgan, are trying to follow suit and will no doubt be competitors someday. Banks and financial institutions are limited in their access to, and transmission of, information, and for good reason. If Facebook, on the other hand, establishes Libra, no other competitor will have equal access to its data, and therefore, a chance at the consumer payment market. In this way, Libra is in keeping with Facebook’s monopolistic business style.Further, the information monopoly Facebook would possess will be similar to what the Chinese government possesses but needs the Great Firewall to execute. Monopolistic forces will produce the same result through different means.Action needs to be taken quickly to stop Libra and break up Big Tech, not only for the welfare of consumers but for the good of the nation.The first step is to force Facebook to divest or spin off Instagram, WhatsApp, Instagram and Chainspace, the blockchain startup it acqui-hired early this year. Facebook also must be mandated to offer a parallel, ad-free, “no collection of information” site supported by fee-based subscriptions. Over time, this would provide some transparency as to the value of the consumer information currently being gifted to Facebook.Google should be forced to divest or spin off YouTube, Double Click and other advertising entities, cloud services and Android. Amazon similarly needs a radical breakup as it too poses systemic threats to a transparent market. (Alexa is a prime example of the private data Amazon gathers on users’ lifestyle and personal habits.)The breakup of these behemoths cannot wait until after the 2020 election.  Such action must be taken on a bipartisan basis as soon as possible. Even once stripped down, Facebook should remain separated from commerce due to privacy concerns. Congress, which has scheduled hearings on Libra for next month, is right to intervene.Editor’s note: Have a reaction to the Facebook news?

170,www.coindesk.com,"Apr 8, 2019",Next Bitcoin Core Release to Finally Connect Hardware ...,https://www.coindesk.com/next-bitcoin-core-release-to-finally-let-hardware-wallets-connect-to-full-nodes,"Bitcoin full nodes allow users to verify that transactions actually took 
place, meanwhile, hardware wallets are considered one of the most secure ...","Apr 8, 2019 at 21:30 UTC",It’s a moment true bitcoin nerds have been waiting for.,"In the coming release of Bitcoin Core, the 18th major version of the cryptocurrency’s most widely used software, the code will finally, natively allow users to connect bitcoin full nodes to hardware wallets.It sounds technical, but it’s a big step for the security for users. Bitcoin full nodes allow users to verify that transactions actually took place, meanwhile, hardware wallets are considered one of the most secure ways to store bitcoin. Thus, making it easier to join the two together is a big win for users who want full control of their bitcoin – and don’t want to lose it.Bitcoin Core lead maintainer Wladimir van der Laan, who is in charge of coordinating the coming upgrade, told CoinDesk it’s one of the features he’s been most excited about for quite some time.Still, the change is part of a much broader effort to make bitcoin full nodes easier to use for people other than just tech geeks. Casa, for example, has launched a node that works without much setup necessary, while developers of the bitcoin protocol are constantly trying to reduce how much data users need to store to run one (as users need to store every transaction ever sent on the blockchain, it’s pretty weighty).As Bitcoin Core contributor Andrew Chow, one of the lead developers on the project, put it on Twitter:“With this [pull request] merged, the upcoming Bitcoin Core 0.18 release will be finally usable with hardware wallets by using [Hardware Wallet Interface (HWI)].”He admits it’s “still command line only and manual,” but argued “it’s a big step forward” because the functionality is finally there, even if in a somewhat clunky form. Developers will continue to make it easier to use down the line.So first off, why use a bitcoin full node in the first place?In order to send a transaction on the bitcoin network, users need to connect to a bitcoin node. Full nodes now require a couple of hundred gigabytes of data, which is a lot, enough to fill a small laptop.But it does serve a purpose, as rather than trust that someone else is feeding you the correct financial information, such as whether you really received a transaction or not, you’re able to validate this information yourself.As the value proposition of bitcoin is to not trust others, some developers go as far as to argue that using bitcoin in a way that removes the full node defeats the purpose of bitcoin.Bitcoin Core contributor Sjors Provoost, for example, has argued that running a full node is helpful for “knowing your bitcoin is real,” offering the example of Segwit2x, a proposed bitcoin fork from 2017 in which some companies, miners, and users proposed upgrading bitcoin to a larger block size.There was concern that in the case Segwit2x broke bitcoin into two, mobile wallets relying on Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) technology would be susceptible to trickery from miners.“That server can in theory also lie about your balance. In a scenario like SegWit2x, it could decide which side of the fork it wants to show you. With a full node you don’t have to worry about that,” Provoost told CoinDesk.Then there’s the issue of privacy.“The wallet software that normally comes with hardware wallets reveals your addresses to a third-party server,” Provoost continued. The full node would replace this wallet software, giving users privacy again.“At the end of the day, it comes down to the trade-off between convenience and trust,” Bitcoin Core wallet maintainer Samuel Dobson told CoinDesk.These problems are what’s fueling the idea that maybe one day “everyone” should run this full node software, so they don’t have to trust anyone else to send them accurate financial information.“Yes, I believe that everybody will eventually run a full node. I wish a future where not having a full node will severely limit your user experience and the realm of things you can do with bitcoin,” as BTCPay creator Nicolas Dorier wrote in a recent blog post.The other piece is hardware wallets are considered the most secure way to store bitcoin. That’s especially true when compared to storing them on internet-connected computers, which are often totally exposed to hackers.“PCs are a much larger attack surface than a small dedicated device to store your keys, designed specifically with security in mind. They’re also less prone to random crashes or corruption which could cause you to lose un-backed-up keys on your computer,” Dobson told CoinDesk.With this new tech in place in the Bitcoin Core software, users can store their bitcoin on an offline hardware wallet, then use their full node to verify the data they’re getting fed, such as transaction data, is correct.The technology has been a long-time coming. Connecting hardware to a full node is also one of the key goals of Electrum Personal Server, pioneered by developer Chris Belcher. “Hopefully this software can be part of the plan to get full node wallets into the hands of as many people as possible,” he said in the project announcement post last year.There are pros and cons to each project, though, Provoost admitted.“The HWI project should reduce the number of separate software components needed, though at the moment I think it’s still less user-friendly [than Electrum Personal Server],” he said.And there’s still a ways to go to get the graphical interface totally working. “Maybe one day in the future we’ll have this graphical picture that I showed you – and after that we’ll have unicorns,” Provoost said in his presentation on the topic.While hardware wallet support in 0.18 has generated much excitement, As usual, the release is filled with other contributions from the pool of global Bitcoin Core contributors.Dobson told CoinDesk about a few features he finds “exciting,” including refinements to a new “language” that the groundwork was laid for in an earlier version of Bitcoin Core. New commands will allow developers to use this language to “import descriptors.”“You can provide such a descriptor to Core […] and it will parse it and import the keys, scripts, etc. into your wallet for you,” Dobson said, explaining further:“This is the first step in a longer term goal to rework the wallet and support these descriptors natively within it, which will clean things up immensely and provide a much more natural behaviours, in line with how you would expect things to behave (and which don’t exactly behave that way currently).”Dobson also pointed to a new “multiwallet” command, which will allow users to pair with multiple wallets within their bitcoin core full node. While the ability to use multiple wallets at once has existed in the code previously, 0.18.0 plugs the feature in the graphical user interface for the first time, so people no longer have to be full-blown developers using the command line to take advantage of the feature.“Version 0.18 adds support to the GUI to do that, as well as a few improvements in how it works too,” Dobson said.As of now, version 0.18 is in the “release candidate” stage of the software development cycle, meaning passionate bitcoin developers and companies are still testing it, picking away at the code in an effort to eradicate any bugs, before it’s released to the larger public to download.According to project developers, it will be available for users to download in the coming weeks.Bitcoin image via Shutterstock"

If it’s outside the authorized area, then it needs to be dealt with as the construction was not approved,” an official from the local land resource bureau said in the report.As the summer rainy season approaches in China, miners have been investing again in Sichuan’s mountainous areas including the Garze and Aba counties, hoping to boost ROI with the regions’ cheap power.In a report published last November by blockchain research firm Coinshare, nearly 50 percent of the global bitcoin network’s hash rate came from facilities located in Sichuan at the time.Recently, the bitcoin network’s total hash rate has climbed to nearly 58,000 petahashes per second – that’s up about 80 percent from last December, when more than 600,000 mining machines were estimated to have shut down amid bitcoin’s bear market prices.The official from the Economic and Information Bureau further indicated that Garze county does not allow bitcoin mining projects.They said:“We don’t allow outside investment in the area to be involved in bitcoin. Even for big data projects, we will conduct an investigation into the nature of the data involved before making a decision.”Mining facility image via CoinDesk archive"

This has long been a point of contention, as critics argue the wallet’s privacy features are insufficient if users’ transaction data is stored on a centralized server anyway.The new node devices will be available this year, the Samourai Wallet team told CoinDesk. Plus, Nodl node owners will be able to update their devices to add Samourai Wallet’s Dojo software. This software will include a feature called Whirlpool, which batches bitcoin transactions together across wallets in order to obfuscate the source of funds.“In addition to Dojo being preloaded onto Nodl devices we will also be preloading Whirlpool desktop mixing, allowing users to access and manage their Samourai Wallet mixing on their desktop,” the Samourai team told CoinDesk.The partnership comes as Nodl sales see an uptick, according to Luczak, expecting to sell roughly 500 devices in 2019 if the current trajectory continues.“For the first time you’ll have a one-click install mixing service that’s available to anyone,” Luczak said.Earlier this month, the company behind Samourai, Katana Cryptographic, announced its first venture funding round: a $100,000 investment from Cypherpunk Holdings.Samurai sword image via Shutterstock"

Casey is the chairman of CoinDesk’s advisory board and a senior advisor for blockchain research at MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative.,"The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers.Given how slowly Washington lawmakers have taken to devise a coherent, informed view of cryptocurrency, the Chair of the House Financial Services Committee’s rapid leap to action last week over Facebook’s ambitious Libra project was remarkably fast.But let’s reflect not on the details of Rep. Maxine Waters’ (D-Calif.) urgent requests that  Facebook to cease work on Libra until after hearings are held or on how European lawmakers made similar appeals. The important takeaway from these legislators’ actions is that they are able to make such demands at all. since this is not the case with truly decentralized projects.Unlike with bitcoin, representatives in Congress can directly identify and talk to the people in charge of the Libra project. They can subpoena them and, thus, pressure them. They might start with David Marcus, head of Facebook subsidiary Calibra, but, ultimately, it’s Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg who’ll give lawmakers the greatest leverage. In this case, the buck stops with Zuck.Now, imagine a Congressional leader calling for a halt in bitcoin development. Who exactly are they going to pressure to end an open-source project involving millions of globally spread mostly unidentifiable developers, miners and users?This distinction – between one project with a single, identifiable authority figure and another whose governance is distributed and leaderless with a founder who has never revealed their identity – goes to the heart of a crypto community critique that the social media giant’s initiative is not censorship resistant.When there’s someone in charge, an interested party – a policymaker, a banker, a regulator, a shareholder – can lean on them to make changes. And when the blockchain consensus model is based on a club-like permissioned membership, a coordinated effort to alter, or censor, the ledger is always possible. And if the ledger or its software can be altered by this pressure, the Libra platform can’t unconditionally promise to support open, unfettered access for users and a permissionless innovation environment for developers.Let’s be clear: Libra’s designers have thought deeply about how to protect their project from Facebook itself, both in a real sense and that of public perception. In its commitment to decentralization, the team has put the code under an open-source license, handed the network’s governance authority to a separate Swiss-based foundation, brought in 27 external partners to work alongside Facebook as independent, permissioned nodes in the network, and verbally committed to transition to a permissionless model over time. There is a structure and roadmap in place for Libra to grow and survive regardless of its genesis as a Facebook project.All that’s fine. But we’re still at the genesis phase, one that is and will for some time hinge on the centrality of a particularly powerful company.At the risk of stating the obvious, Marcus and his team are paid by Facebook. Follow the money, as they say. But also, follow the code.The Libra protocol’s all-important source code is now open-sourced, but it was conceived and gestated inside Facebook. So, whether the project managers and programmers resist or not, the culture of that organization will inherently feed into Libra’s design priorities.The elephant in the room is that a drumbeat of recent news has revealed Facebook’s corporate culture to be profoundly toxic. The company’s model of surveillance capitalism has turned users into pawns in a global game of data manipulation, cultivated echo chambers of narrow-mindedness, done irreparable harm to the worthy cause of journalism, and deeply undermined our democracy.This legacy is the unavoidable reason why people, including lawmakers, are alarmed that Facebook might be on the verge of creating a new international model for money and payments. Rightly or wrongly, there’s a fox-in-the-henhouse optic here that’s unhelpful.Wharton Professor Kevin Werbach argued in the New York Times this week that Facebook’s Libra is a bold effort to win back public trust by leveraging the accountability ingrained in blockchain technology. But at the project’s genesis phase, with no choice but to trust Facebook’s early input, that legacy of prior mistrust could easily become a huge barrier to its progress.Notwithstanding all the above, I actually want Libra to succeed. (Note: I also want Facebook to die. That’s not a contradiction; those two outcomes can and should be separate. In fact, it’s the nub of the issue.)  The Libra team has set its sights on achieving financial inclusion for the 2 billion adults worldwide who don’t have bank accounts. It’s a noble goal, and they are going about in an intelligent way – from a truly international, cross-border, cross-currency perspective. Bring all those people into the international economy and the payoffs could be huge, for them and for the rest of us.And let’s face it, bitcoin has dismally failed to live up to its advocates’ promises of a financial inclusion solution. Bitcoin’s and other cryptocurrencies’ impact on the $800 billion global remittances market is puny.Sure, uptake could rise if the off-chain Lightning Network lives up to its promise to enable larger-scale transaction-processing, if stablecoin projects resolve bitcoin’s volatility problem, and if new encryption solutions can improve both security and user experience with crypto wallets. But these solutions will take time. We need to act now.In the end, it’s not at all clear that global person-to-person payments are a viable use case for bitcoin, perhaps because too many HODLing speculators crowd all the spenders out. And, of course, no other payments-focused cryptocurrency has put a big enough dent in the remittance market.So, perhaps the recipe for a global broadening in payments lies with a cross-border, low-volatility international stablecoin backed by a basket of leading fiat currencies and developed with the formidable programming and marketing resources of 28 tech and financial giants. Also, when you combine Facebook’s, Instagram’s and WhatsApp’s user count, the number of potential wallets runs to 4 billion. Global network effects. Instantly.All other things being equal – that is, if we ignore, for now, the genesis problem of Libra inheriting Facebook’s toxic roots – one could also argue that a permissioned, corporate network is the best approach for the Libra blockchain in place of a fully open, permissionless chain such as bitcoin’s or ethereum’s. The heavy lifting needed for early global traction  – the software development, the marketing effort and the public policy outreach – requires that significant corporate resources be deployed in a targeted, coordinated manner that’s hard for open-source blockchain communities to achieve. There are efficiency advantages to be had from centralization.Over time, as the project grows, Libra hopes to expand the consortium. That could undermine the coordination efficiency, but in a classic centralization-versus-decentralization tradeoff, the addition of new members – more NGOs, some banks, a workers union perhaps, and some public pension funds – will achieve greater diversity and lower collusion capacity. It’s far from perfect but the timed transition brings things closer to censorship resistance at a time in the future when it will matter — if it they get there.As an aside, I also believe Libra’s success would be a positive for bitcoin – and the past week’s price action suggests that the market sees the same.Here’s why: Currently the one value proposition that holds well for bitcoin is that it will be a more liquid, digitally up-to-date risk-hedging vehicle than gold when people need to preserve value in something immune from political and institutional risk. That argument could be enhanced if Libra succeeds in converting billions of people to digital payment wallets, because it will more broadly establish the power of blockchain-based digital money as the way of the future. At the same time, because of its genesis as a Facebook-initiated, permissioned system, Libra will not shake the perception of being prone to political – i.e. censorship – risks. For many, then, Bitcoin, aka digital gold, will become the obvious alternative.The currency-basket-backed Libra token is, however, a real competitor to other reserve-backed crypto-tokens, such as USDC, issued by the CENTER coalition initially formed by Circle and Coinbase, GUSD, Gemini’s stablecoin, and PAX, from Paxos.But we can imagine events working in the latter’s favor. Developing countries like India, for example, may become hostile to a new currency entering circulation that sucks demand away from their local currencies, but they would be more accepting of a digital dollar, given that the greenback already circulates in their economies. Users, also, might be happier holding tokens pegged to single sovereign currencies rather than in a hard-to-measure basket. And if concerns about centralized control undermines trust in Libra or limits innovation, the fact that these tokens are built on truly permissionless blockchains may make them more appealing (even if you still have to trust the reserve-holder to guarantee to the price stability.) Whatever happens, the world of money flows is mind-blowingly huge. There are $6 trillion a day in foreign exchange transactions alone. That allows plenty of room for different models, different tastes, and different trust systems for coordinating digital value exchange.The bigger risk is not that Libra succeeds and enriches Mark Zuckerberg even more but that neither Libra nor one of its crypto competitors ever succeeds in breaking down the barriers to economic participation. Financial exclusion breeds poverty, which in turn breeds terrorism and war.And if we assume that the technology, if it isn’t yet ready, will ultimately get there, then the biggest threat to that is from a policy mistake.The subtext of both Waters’ statements and those of European lawmakers was that this private exchange system can’t be allowed to replace national currencies. Thats’ not what Libra intends, but the perception that it is undermining nation states’ sovereignty over money could stoke fears and lead to a ban on Libra. And if that happens, it sets an ugly precedent for or all other competing ideas, whether it’s USDC, GUSD, PAX or DAI or something else.The projects capacity to foster financial inclusion could also be hurt by the Financial Action Task Force’s, or FATF,  embrace of a new rule for exchanging cryptocurrency.  If ratified by enough countries that could curtail the free flow of cryptocurrency among addresses that haven’t been through a bank-like “know your customer” process. In other words, it could pose a real barrier to Libra’s and everyone else’s dream of financial inclusion for the “unbanked.”The bottom line: the Libra team has its work cut out, and we all have a lot riding on it. The project’s representatives must face the reality that, for now at least, the buck still stops with Zuck, and that regulators will use that against them. We should all wish them success in trying to convince policymakers that an open-system to global financial transactions is important. (It’s encouraging that the Bank of England is taking an open-minded view, proposing that tech companies like Libra be allowed to access funds directly from central banks.)But, by the same token, we must be vigilant against corporate power that could easily convert this important project into something more sinister. Facebook’s own history is a reminder of the risks we face.I wish it were a different company running with this ball right now. But since it’s not, the need for all of us to take a direct interest in this project is even greater.We must demand that our representatives provide clear-headed, informed oversight that holds corporations like this to account and curtails their monopolizing powers. But we should also expect smart, open-minded regulation that encourages companies to compete and innovate in an open system that creates opportunities for everyone on this planet.Image Credit: David Tran Photo / Shutterstock.com"

Research. News; Learn; Research. Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Jun 21, 2019 at 16:00 UTC",A powerful intergovernmental organization devoted to combating money laundering and terrorism financing has finalized its recommendations on regulating cryptocurrencies for its 37 member countries.,"As expected, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) standards released Friday include a controversial requirement that “virtual asset service providers” (VASPs), including crypto exchanges, pass information about their customers to one another when transferring funds between firms.The final recommendation makes official the contentious part of FATF’s February proposal, saying countries should make sure that when crypto businesses send money, they:“… obtain and hold required and accurate originator [sender] information and required beneficiary [receipient] information and submit the information to beneficiary institutions … if any. Further, countries should ensure that beneficiary institutions … obtain and hold required (not necessarily accurate) originator information and required and accurate beneficiary information …”Under the new guidance, the required information for each transfer includes:Calling the “threat of criminal and terrorist misuse of virtual assets” a “serious and urgent” issue, FATF said in a public statement that it will give countries 12 months to adopt the guidelines, with a review set for June 2020.The so-called travel rule is a longstanding requirement for international banks when sending each other money on customers’ behalf. But blockchain industry advocates argued it would be onerous if not impossible to put into practice with crypto, harmful to user privacy, and counter-productive to law enforcement goals.The guidelines also suggest that individuals using crypto wallets to transmit value could be designated VASPs, and thus subject to licensing requirements – at least if they do so as a business.“In cases where the VASP is a natural person, it should be required to be licensed or registered in the jurisdiction where its place of business is located—the determination of which may include several factors for consideration by countries,” the document says.Individuals are not VASPs if they use crypto to buy goods or services or if they make “a one-off exchange or transfer,” FATF said.FATF is also giving countries the option of requiring foreign VASPs that provide products or services within their jurisdiction to register with the appropriate authorities.“Competent authorities should take the necessary legal or regulatory measures to prevent criminals or their associates from holding, or being the beneficial owner of, a significant or controlling interest, or holding a management function in, a VASP,” the guidance states elsewhere.“Such measures should include requiring VASPs to seek authorities’ prior approval for substantive changes in shareholders, business operations, and structures,” it adds.For enforcement purposes, FATF recommends that countries consider using open-source information and web-scraping tools to identify unregistered or unlicensed operations advertising their services. Authorities should also consider public feedback, information from reporting institutions and “non-publically available information,” such as intelligence or law enforcement reports.The guidance even addresses services designed to obfuscate the origin of crypto transfers, saying nations should make sure that providers can either manage or mitigate the risks of transfers that use mixers, tumblers or similar tools. “If the VASP cannot manage and mitigate the risks posed by engaging in such activities, then the VASP should not be permitted to engage in such activities,” the document reads.VASPs should also be able to freeze or prohibit transactions with sanctioned individuals, FATF said.Data analytics company Chainalysis, among others, has warned that instead of more transparency, the now-official rule would spur services to shut down or drop off the radar.But despite hearing such concerns at a private-sector consultation meeting in Vienna last month, which drew 300 attendees, the FATF, led by the United States, pressed ahead.“By adopting the standards and guidelines agreed to this week, the FATF will make sure that virtual asset service providers do not operate in the dark shadows,” U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in remarks to the FATF plenary session held Friday in Orlando, Florida.This will help the fintech sector “stay one step ahead of rogue regimes and sympathizers of illicit causes,” he said, adding:“We will not allow cryptocurrency to become the equivalent of secret numbered accounts [and] we will allow for proper use, but we will not tolerate the continued use for illicit activities.”To be clear: FATF’s recommendations for anti-money-laundering policies are not binding; member countries adopt them by passing legislation or writing regulations. However, countries that fall egregiously out of compliance with FATF standards get put on a blacklist, making them radioactive to foreign investment.The crypto guidelines come a week ahead of the annual Group of 20 (G20) summit in Osaka, Japan, on June 28-29. The G20, comprised of 19 countries and the European Union, has been pushing for international harmonization of crypto regulations.The guidelines also come just before the United States’ one-year presidency of the FATF ends on June 30. Marshall Billingslea, the U.S. Treasury official who holds the rotating post, had listed applying FATF standards to virtual currency among his top priorities.UPDATE (June 21, 20:30 UTC): Details were added to the passage about designating certain individuals as VASPs.Steven Mnuchin image via photocosmos1 / Shutterstock."

Since launch, the company has processed over $300 million in digital asset transactions, according to its own figures.Bitcoin IRA registered as a Third-Party Administrator for BitGo, through its Digital IRA division to handle all administrative responsibilities including transfer applications, compliance, and transaction monitoring.BitGo will protect these new securities by providing cold storage “maintained in a secure, bank-quality vault offline in South Dakota,” with a clearly defined protocol on who can access the holdings, Corcoran said. Apart from physical security, Corcoran claims that the company also exceeds the regulators’ demands for the amount of capitalization and insurance behind the assets.While he was unable to disclose those figures, but said the company acts as a fiduciary. “BitGo is a master engineer of risk and security, whether for largest institutional investor or someone beginning their retirement savings,” said Bitcoin IRA COO Chris Kline. “The whole spectrum will benefit.”These investors are “very diverse. Not the typical archetype seen for traditional assets,” he said.Every generation is apparently interested for different reasons, while Kline is proud of the general parity between male and female investors, as well as with the geographical spread. “We have clients in every state of the union.” “Except New York,” he adds after pausing to reflect on the requirement in the state for the so-called BitLicense.Opening an account is instantaneous, he explained, but, because the firm “can’t automate compliance,” it may take more than a day to pass know-your-customer procedures. Additionally, funding one’s account can take as long as 10 to 15 days depending on the client’s current custodian.Kline suggested that these new IRAs move at the speed of the internet and are a “solution raised from digital era built for digital era.”Coin jar image via Shutterstock"

The company has brought on a number of engineers through its recent acquisitions (Bakkt has also acquired some assets, including personnel, from Rosenthal Collins Group, an independent futures commission merchant).“There’s a lot of interest still in this market,” he said.One of the primary causes for Bakkt’s delays are regulatory in nature – specifically, it is widely believed that the firm’s plan to custody bitcoin itself under federal supervision and settle contracts through its parent firm’s clearinghouse have placed it in a regulatory gray area.While Sprecher did not specifically address what the holdups were, he did note that regulators are still trying to understand the asset class and how to regulate it.“You can’t really get into the true institutional markets that we serve without being highly regulated and highly trusted so the juice is worth the squeeze,” he said, adding:“It’s going well now, there were a lot of things that had to get sorted out with jurisdiction and custody and … banks and those issues that in my mind need to be resolved before adoption of the asset class and we’ve been at the forefront of [this].”The bear market has helped in this sense as well, by giving both regulators and legislators in the U.S. some additional time to determine how they might eventually regulate this space, Sprecher said.Sprecher did not address how much ICE has spent on Bakkt to date, though Scott Hill, chief financial officer at ICE, previously said that the firm planned to invest between $20 and $25 million in 2019. This figure comes on top of $182 million Bakkt raised from investors.Jeffrey Sprecher image via CoinDesk archives"

As SegWit’s use, support, and adoption grows, it will help reduce fees, wait times, and network congestion.”As helpful a change SegWit is for boosting how many transactions bitcoin can support at once, each individual wallet and exchange needs to individually code up support for the new type of transaction. And adding native SegWit addresses takes a bit more time — hence why the change hasn’t been rolled out everywhere.But Gemini – perhaps best-known for being led by entrepreneur-brothers Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss – is eager to adopt the technology in part because it enables lightning, a “layer-two” technology seen by advocates as the future of bitcoin payments.“SegWit transactions also lay the groundwork for more advanced technologies; of which the lightning network is the most well known,” Vadino explains.Gemini admits, though, it still might take a while for the ecosystem to fully adopt the change.“We think it’s the right time to make this change, though there will still be some growing pains,” wrote Gemini software engineer Brian KimJohnson in a blog post that announced the change. “Notably, while some block explorers are capable of tracking native SegWit addresses, the support varies widely from one solution to another.”Binary code image via Shutterstock"

rate, is suing the co-founders of Poolin, the seventh-largest pool, ...","Jun 17, 2019 at 02:10 UTC",The Takeaway,"Cryptocurrency mining giant Bitmain is locked in a legal battle with three former employees who started a rival mining pool.Bitmain, the owner of BTC.com, the world’s top bitcoin mining pool by hash rate, is suing the co-founders of Poolin, the seventh-largest pool, for allegedly violating a non-compete agreement – and it’s demanding $4.3 million in damages from one of them.For their part, the three Poolin co-founders say they were no longer bound by the non-compete, since it was Bitmain that invalidated their contracts for failing to pay compensation on time as agreed. The case offers a rare window on the inner workings and employment practices of Bitmain, one of the blockchain industry’s largest and most powerful companies. Bitmain makes most of its money from selling mining equipment, according to financials disclosed during the firm’s abortive attempt to go public. But it also operates mining pools, essentially software products miners use to split rewards. This service accounted for $43.2 million of Bitmain’s revenues in the first half of 2018, the most recent period for which data is available, compared to $2.7 billion of hardware sales during the same period.There are six lawsuits pending in the Beijing Haidian District court. The three Poolin co-founders –  CEO Zhibiao Pan; COO Fa Zhu; and CTO Tianzhao Li – each sued Bitmain preemptively, seeking to be released from the non-compete. Bitmain, in turn, countersued each of them, claiming they caused significant losses to the company after leaving by operating a directly competing pool. Aside from seeking damages, Bitmain asked the court to order the Poolin executives to resume honoring the non-compete agreement.  The dispute has largely escaped public notice, but video footage recently became available of an April 30 hearing where the two sides made their respective cases. The video only showed discussion of the case between Pan and Bitmain. As such, exact details regarding the other two former employees were not clear until now.The main dispute in these cases boils down to the roles the three Poolin founders played in Bitmain’s flagship mining pool BTC.com, and the non-compete agreements they signed when they decided to leave Bitmain.In a WeChat post written by Zhu and published by a Chinese crypto media outlet in January commemorating bitcoin’s 10-year anniversary, he briefly recounted the trio’s work at Bitmain.Zhu wrote that back in 2015, the three – while still focusing on Bitmain’s original mining pool, Antpool – proposed to launch BTC.com as a parallel service within Bitmain. The idea was not initially supported by Bitmain, Zhu wrote, and the three had to develop and roll it out on their own using Pan’s own capital at the beginning. In 2016, Pan open-sourced the code of BTC.com, which helped lower the threshold for anyone that’s interested in launching a mining pool business. The three collaborators left Bitmain around mid-2017. Under the non-compete agreement, Bitmain would pay monthly compensation to Pan after his departure of about $2,780 for 24 months, and in return, prohibit him from specifically operating a bitcoin mining pool. The compensation for the other two under such agreements was not clear from the court video. After their departure from Bitmain, Pan, Zhu and Li launched Poolin as mining pool for multiple cryptocurrency assets in November 2017. They didn’t launch a pool service for bitcoin until July 2018, when they mined Poolin’s first block of the largest cryptocurrency by market cap.It has since grown into one of the largest bitcoin mining pools. Based on facts agreed on by both sides of the case and presented to the court, as of Feb. 14, Poolin was the third biggest operation by hash rate in the world, after BTC.com and AntPool. All told, miners connected to Poolin had mined 26,825 bitcoin, worth $220 million at today’s prices.Notably, Poolin’s share of the hash rate has dropped since then to about 8.2 percent, and its rank has fallen to No. 7, based on the current distribution of bitcoin’s network computation.Subsequently, Bitmain alleged that such conduct violated the non-compete agreement, and demanded that Pan return all the paid compensation, as well as a fine of $667,000 for reneging.Further, Bitmain’s lawyers argued at the hearing that the revenues Poolin generated from mining the 26,825 bitcoin should be considered a profit made by violating the agreement, which should be paid back as a loss to Bitmain.“Based on the agreement, if it’s difficult to calculate all the direct and indirect loss [for Bitmain due to Poolin’s violation], then the loss should be calculated based on the profits made by the violating party,” one of the lawyers said. “As of Feb. 14, the total profits for Poolin would be 26,825 bitcoin times 4 percent, which was their handling fee, and times bitcoin’s price at the time, which was 24,518 yuan [$3,500],” the lawyer argued.That, added to the alleged fine, would amount to more than 30 million yuan, or about $4.3 million.But lawyers representing the Poolin founders argued to the court that Pan was not obligated to honor the agreement and thus should not be ordered to pay damages. Pan’s lawyers said in the hearing that Bitmain failed to pay Pan the agreed-upon compensation on time, citing lines from the agreement that if Party A (Bitmain) did not pay the compensation within a month since Party B (Pan)’s departure, it would mean Party A voided its obligation.Further, Pan’s lawyers argued the transaction fee Poolin received doesn’t necessarily translate to profits of the company because until the date of the hearing, the firm had not turned a profit. In addition, the fact that Poolin successfully mined 26,825 bitcoin also does not necessarily mean it would be a loss for BTC.com, the lawyer said.“There are a lot more bitcoin mining pools in this network. It’s not just Poolin v.s. BTC.com. Even if Poolin didn’t operate its bitcoin mining pool, it does not necessarily mean Bitmain will be able to mine those coins.” the lawyer argued. So far, it’s not yet clear from the public record whether the court has made a judgment or when it will. The judge asked at the end of the hearing if there was a way for the two parties to settle the case. Lawyers from Bitmain declined to discuss that at the court and suggested waiting until after the hearing adjourned. Bitmain declined to comment or provide further clarification on the status of the cases. Poolin executives did not respond to CoinDesk’s inquiries by press time.This is not the first time Bitmain has had a legal dispute with former senior executives. In 2017, it sued Zuoxing Yang, a former Bitmain chip design director who left to launch Bitewei, a rival mining equipment manufacturer, over patent rights infringement.  Bitmain initially demanded damages of 26 billion yuan, or $3.8 billion, but later reduced the claim to $380,000. In 2018, the court in Xinjiang that oversaw the case dismissed Bitmain’s complaint after Yang successfully revoked Bitmain’s patent over the technology in dispute.Hearing image via Beijing Haidian District Court"

The chain split occurred after the bitcoin cash network tried to upgrade to new software at block number 582,679, according to data from BitMEX Research’s Forkmonitor tool.As noted by a user on Reddit, one version of the software by bitcoin cash developer group – Bitcoin ABC – carried a code bug affecting the bitcoin cash mempool that was unrelated to the upgrade itself.Similar to the bitcoin blockchain, bitcoin cash requires miners to validate transactions and append new blocks. The mempool consists of all pending transactions on the blockchain awaiting approval by a miner.As stated by Reddit user “FerriestaPatronum“:“Looks like there was a small bug in the mempool-acceptance rules for after the [hard fork]…From what I currently understand, it looks like the operation count was being validated with the old rules, not the new one.”Since then, however, developers have released new code to fix the bug. According to data from CoinDance and comments from observers, the bug resulted in a string of empty transaction blocks prior to the fix.Vin Armani – CTO of bitcoin cash application CoinText – reaffirmed to CoinDesk: “Blocks were going in empty for about an hour and a half. Now the mempool is clear and transactions are going into blocks normally. All is back to normal.”Yet it is unclear at this time how many nodes – that is, computer servers running Bitcoin ABC software – have upgraded to the fixed software.In response to the issue, crypto exchange Poloniex announced that it was pausing withdrawals and deposits in light of the hard fork issue.To this, Poloniex Exchange tweeted:“BCH had an issue with the planned hard fork scheduled for today. As a result, we have disabled deposits and withdrawals for BCHABC until further notice. BCH core developers are working on it. Thank you for your patience.”According to the R&D team of mining and pool operations for blockchain startup Navier, the majority of bitcoin cash miners use Bitcoin ABC software as opposed to other bitcoin cash software implementations such as Bitcoin Unlimited (BU).“The majority of bitcoin cash miners use the ABC client rather than the BU client, so people were creating transactions and submitting them to the mempool faster than they could be written to a block and most of those blocks were empty, “ explained David Steinberg, the vice president of Navier.Steinberg emphasized that having a diversity of software implementations could prevent similar glitches in code from tripping up the blockchain network.Steinberg told CoinDesk:“Having a single type of node is a form of centralization – you’re trusting the codebase from the node type you’ve selected to keep working as expected. Ideally, miners would have multiple types of node available to submit to in case something like this happens again.”Having “singularly popular protocol implementations,” according to Steinberg, are especially dangerous during hard forks.“The fact the introduction of this bug coincided with the hard fork exacerbated the issue, since you must upgrade your node to participate in the fork,” explained Steinberg. “For normal incremental updates, not every node will be up to date as quickly, so a problem like this is more likely to affect only a small number of miners.”As such, Steinberg concluded:“I’d say the biggest takeaway here is that programmers make mistakes, and that even decentralized systems can be affected in unexpected ways by the tiniest bits of centralization, like relying on a single codebase.”This is a developing story and will be updated. The excerpt of this story has been updated to clarify that the code bug was unrelated to the hard fork code itself.Crossed fork image via Shutterstock "

Tor’s usefulness in this scenario is interesting because, in addition to this, such an approach helps users blast through some of the thorny networking hurdles that come with setting up a node.As Lopp stated:“With Tor, we were able to punch through all these networking issues.”Casa added Tor support back in April. While it may sound contradictory, one of the biggest issues when setting up a Casa full node (which Lopp said takes up a “significant portion” of staff support time) is making sure that other nodes can see it on the network. To do so, users need to set up “port forwarding.”In theory, this should be a simple process. A user just plugs in the port number the node is running on into their router’s port forwarding website. But users have all sorts of problems, Lopp said, since there are “hundreds of thousands” of different routers with different settings, and some are easier to set up than others.Casa has tried a “universal plug and play” setting to help with this issue, but Lopp said it “works in like less than 50 percent of cases,” whereas Tor just routes around the problem altogether. There is one negative aspect to using Tor, however.“The only downside is you have to get a Tor browser,” Lopp said, which he admitted is not the easiest process. But between using Tor and trying to deal with a router’s port forwarding configuration, Lopp believes the choice is obvious.“It’s easier to do that than going through all this networking complexity,” he said.Jameson Lopp image by Alyssa Hertig for CoinDesk"

Casey is the chairman of CoinDesk’s advisory board and a senior advisor for blockchain research at MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative.,"The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers.“Privacy is dead. Get over it.”We hear that refrain a lot. So often, in fact, that it has (almost) become accepted wisdom for how the digital age must evolve. Sure, there’s concern about the relentless accumulation of data about our online lives. There are even some legislative efforts to hold it back, most notably in Europe.But there’s an all-too common perception that such efforts are doomed, that the encroachment into our private lives can’t or shouldn’t be impeded. It’s a view that’s either framed by a glass-half-full position that the benefits of the Fourth Industrial Revolution outweigh the costs of lost privacy, or by its glass-half-empty alternative: that the data machines of our global economy can’t be stopped whether we’d like them to or not.Yet the irony is that the torrent of information delivered by these machines frequently includes new items that make you stop and question this pervading fatalism. They remind us that lives are at stake, that we must take concrete measures to protect the private realm.This Twitter post by Quartz reporter Mary Hui was one such item:There is usually never a line at the train ticketing machines. Judging from an overheard convo, it appears that people are reluctant to use their rechargeable Octopus cards for fear of leaving a paper trail of them having been present at the protest. pic.twitter.com/s1rsgSnCqL— Mary Hui (@maryhui) June 12, 2019The setting, of course, is Hong Kong, where hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets last week to protest changes to extradition laws that many believe would open a back-door to mainland Chinese judicial oversight. The behavior shown here reflects fears that Beijing is already, in effect, using a backdoor to surveil and control Hong Kong’s citizens, in this case via payments technology.On Saturday, Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam announced that the extradition bill would be suspended, according to the New York Times.Up until now, the Octopus card has been mostly hailed as a success story for the Hong Kong economy. The contactless stored value card, introduced by the Mass Transit Railway system just three months after Chinese sovereignty over the former British colony territory was restored in 1997, has evolved from simply a multi-ride MTR ticket into a widely accepted method of payment around the city. And by reducing the costs that banks impose on credit card payments, it has helped lubricate commerce in Hong Kong.That was all fine until people began to realize that the Octopus network could also be a state surveillance tool, a concern that was, naturally, heightened by the ongoing encroachment of Chinese governance in Hong Kong’s affairs. So, as outlined in a follow-up report from Hui, many of the protesters resorted to the obscurity of cash-purchased MTR tickets instead of using their card. In fact, as others reported, many also went “dark” on social media, foregoing digital tools that had until recently been viewed as empowering the protest movement.In a response to Hui’s post, my fellow CoinDesk advisory board member Dovey Wan showed how these actions in Hong Kong must be understood in the context of current digital life on the mainland. There, the pervasive use of mobile payment apps such as Tencent’s WePay and Alibaba’s Alipay has turned China into a virtually cashless society, one that has also given rise to losses of privacy and alternative workarounds to limit that loss:In mainland cash is almost obsolete, most of economic activities are associated real identities : both Alipay and wechat are under real name system + bio metrics.many important figures/celebs use others’ payment accounts all the time to keep names untraceable in the system https://t.co/66eWY473X8— Dovey Wan 🦖 (@DoveyWan) June 13, 2019I’ve written elsewhere about the dangers of cashlessness if digital payment systems don’t respect privacy. What’s at stake is the fungibility of money itself. But this Hong Kong-versus-China story goes to something more fundamental: the protection of human free will, which also happens to matter enormously to the global economy.A desperate desire to preserve this fundamental right is what drew the masses into the streets last week. They know of the “Black Mirror” implications of China’s “social credit” program for tracking and scoring individuals’ digital activity, which the State Council last week identified as a vital government objective. But while the protesters may not have expressed it this way, they were also fighting to preserve Hong Kong’s vital role in international commerce.When Deng Xiaoping’s “One Country, Two Systems” principle defined how Hong Kong would maintain its own economic and political administration after the handover, it was an implicit recognition that property rights, freedom of the press and other basic rights were integral to the territory’s economy, which China had a strong interest in sustaining.Such assurances then became critical to Hong Kong’s continued status as Asia’s financial hub. They meant the world’s banks could maintain their thriving regional headquarters inside the territory’s glittering office towers, allowing it to function as a kind of East-meets-West transition point. Banks and their clients could do business with China, but enjoy Western legal protections. Trade could thrive.Since then, the formation of special economic zones in booming mainland cities like Shenzhen and Shanghai have drawn banks and other foreign companies into China and have slightly diminished Hong Kong’s clout as a financial hub. Nonetheless, with a trade war growing between the U.S. and China, Hong Kong’s politically and economically liberal status is as important as ever.This is as much in China’s interest as the West’s. As China asserts its international influence through its massive Belt and Road Initiative, for example, we can assume that companies from that scheme’s 60-plus other countries will resist submitting to Chinese judicial oversight.Hong Kong’s legal framework, with its proven respect for property rights, offers a compromise. (The territory was deliberately cited as the anchor jurisdiction for the Belt and Road Blockchain Consortium, which Pindar Wong, another CoinDesk advisor, founded to lay out a Belt and Road framework for arbitrating cross-border disputes over smart contracts.)And while the bill itself has been delayed (but not withdrawn), if hardliners have their way in Hong Kong, it could ultimately set back the initiative and constrain global trade itself.But let’s bring this all back to human beings, money and technology.While we can debate, as four Consensus panelists did last month, whether a fundamental human right to transact exists, we can all agree that economic exchange underpins society and that, therefore, hindering it holds us all back. Orwellian digital surveillance is a particularly powerful hindrance. We must resist it.This is why the pro-privacy principles that underpin early cryptocurrency ideas matter. It’s why coins such as Zcash and Monero, which aim to overcome some of bitcoin’s privacy limitations, are important. And it’s why other new pro-privacy initiatives, such as those enabled by secure multi-party computation, should be encouraged. Its why we should oppose over-reach by regulatory bodies like the Financial Action Task Force.Above all, it’s why we must support Hong Kong’s protesters.

While Google Trends does not provide the exact number of searches, it is apparent the amount of worldwide “bitcoin” searches reached 90 percent of what it was on Nov. 20, as is shown below.!function(){""use strict"";window.addEventListener(""message"",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[""datawrapper-height""])for(var t in a.data[""datawrapper-height""]){var e=document.getElementById(""datawrapper-chart-""+t);e&&(e.style.height=a.data[""datawrapper-height""][t]+""px"")}})}();!function(){""use strict"";window.addEventListener(""message"",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[""datawrapper-height""])for(var t in a.data[""datawrapper-height""]){var e=document.getElementById(""datawrapper-chart-""+t);e&&(e.style.height=a.data[""datawrapper-height""][t]+""px"")}})}();Indeed, “bitcoin” searches sky-rocketed on Tuesday as investors, traders and the media alike were searching for reasons as to why bitcoin’s price surged.Interestingly, most searches came from countries that may not seem to be the most likely of origins.Google’s data further reveals the largest amount of searches on April 2-3 were from St. Helena, Netherlands, South Africa, Nigeria and Austria in that order. The U.S., Canada, and the U.K. did not crack the top 10 of most “bitcoin” searchers, ranking in at 11, 12 and 17 respectively.The significance of a spike in bitcoin searches may seem trivial at face value, but studies have shown there is a connection between the price of the cryptocurrency and its search interest. The core findings suggest periods of low search volume tend to precede large markups in price that coincide with bitcoin’s famous, or perhaps infamously wild market cycles.Disclosure: The author holds several cryptocurrencies, please see Sam’s author profile for more information. Google image via Shutterstock"

platform in Singapore next week, its chief financial officer said.","Apr 17, 2019 at 21:07 UTC","Cryptocurrency exchange giant Binance will launch its new fiat-to-crypto platform in Singapore next week, its chief financial officer said.","CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao announced in early April that the Singapore fiat “on-ramp” would be coming sometime this month. But speaking to CoinDesk Wednesday from Paris, Binance CFO Wei Zhou gave a more precise timeframe.  “Next week we are going to launch the Singapore simple buy/sell on-ramp,” said Zhou, who was in town for Paris Blockchain Week. “It will actually be a new product we are launching, as a very easy buy/sell platform so users in Singapore can buy and sell bitcoin with Singapore dollars.”Zhou said that for now in Singapore, “it will just be bitcoin, but we hope to add more [cryptocurrencies]. For a lot of these regulated jurisdictions, it’s easy to start with things that people know and understand and you can gradually build on that.”Binance began its project of building fiat-to-crypto gateways in January when it partnered with Simplex to let traders use Visa and MasterCard to buy a wide range of cryptos. Then in March, it launched Binance Lite in Australia which allows users to buy bitcoin at newsagents in over 1,300 locations across the country.The company’s expansion in recent months has been both rapid and eclectic, taking in Europe and the U.K. via the islands of Malta and the British Crown Dependency of Jersey. The company has also set up in Uganda citing the need to bring financial inclusion to the underbanked in that region. It is currently the No. 5 exchange by 24-hour trade volume (when excluding no-fee trades and transaction mining), according to CoinMarketCap.  Asked if the exchange had any designs on North America, Zhou said: “We have plans for U.S. but I can’t go into these right now.” Binance has also embarked on plans to start a system of decentralized exchange (DEX), which is going to be built on Binance Chain, the exchange’s home-grown ledger to transfer and trade blockchain assets.  In terms of the timing of that, Zhou noted that the Binance Chain testnet is up and running and “we hope to release the mainnet by the end of the month as well.” He said there are a couple of reasons for pursuing a DEX route. As well as providing trading functionality, exchanges, by their centralized nature right now, hold customers’ assets, making them juicy targets for hackers. “That is a risk that we do not want to take in the long run,” said ZhouSpeaking philosophically, Zhou also pointed out that change is the only constant in crypto. Two years ago 90 percent of trading was fiat to crypto; today 90 percent is crypto-to-crypto, he said. Hence:“I think the key here is that innovation is going to happen regardless of whether it comes from us or other people – so we would rather be proactive.”It’s possible to disrupt your own business model and do so in a virtuous way, Zhou added. “We are almost there, very close.”Regarding the expectation that large swathes of institutional investors from the traditional finance world are waiting to enter the crypto sphere at some point soon, Zhou said Binance has seen institutional trading increase some 40 percent to 50 percent over the past six months. According to Zhou, these institutional traders are leveraging Binance’s application programming interface (API), heralding a new type of institution entering the space. These players wield less capital than, say, a typical tech-focused hedge fund, but they operate in a way that is “highly nimble, highly algorithm-driven and highly efficient,” he said.This will characterize the new money entering institutional crypto trading, said Zhou, adding:“I think right now, all the world is focused on what they call ‘old money’ – which is great, but I think the style of a lot of these institutions just don’t move at crypto speed.” In the context of crypto trading, algorithmic trading strategies interact directly with the technology of an exchange. Traders can develop their own applications, using programming languages like Python, and execute trades using the API. “It’s basically my code fighting against your code fighting against another code – figuring out each one,” said Zhou.Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao: CoinDesk archives"

Listen to what a law enforcement expert has to say.“Identifying owners of non-custodial wallets in majority cases simply cannot be done by private companies with reasonable certainty,” said Jarek Jakubcek, a strategy analyst at Europol, the European Union law enforcement agency. “Thus, mandating businesses to do something that cannot be done is an exercise in futility.”Identifying owners who send transactions from one identified party to another is feasible, assuming that tracing tools “correctly cluster and identify the entities (which they frequently do not),” Jakubcek told me. Of course, this would entail restricting user privacy, and allowing businesses to exchange sensitive personally identifiable information (PII) with one another.And to what purpose? “The majority of exchange-to-exchange transactions are related to trading activities that are naturally not criminal,” said Jakubcek, “so reallocating compliance resources at a high number of relatively low-risk transactions will move the emphasis away from flagging criminal transactions to focusing on low-risk transactions, which will naturally hurt crime prevention.”As a result, he said:“The only benefit for the exchange will be a formal check in a compliance checkbox.”If Jakubcek is right, a substantial part of crypto transactions will move to the underworld, leaving law enforcement and financial intelligence units with nothing, except the trace of transactions.If the proposal is adopted, FATF’s member countries will eventually require all Virtual Assets Service Providers (VASPs) to do the same as other financial institutions do — to transmit information in one way or another.Thereby, there would be several implications:Many industry representatives attended the FATF Forum to receive clarification on this proposal and its implications. (I went as a delegate of the Blockchain and Virtual Currency Working Group, or BVCWG.) Several questions have been brought forward:The FATF has not addressed these questions, and delegates got the perception that nobody knows the solution for being compliant under the proposed rule.FATF’s attempt to apply an outdated instrument to a new vehicle is just the tip of the iceberg, however. The core issue is with the travel rule itself. Nowadays it barely serves its aims.The recommendation, first issued in October 2001 following the 9/11 attacks, was intended to prevent terrorists and other criminals from having unfettered access to wire transfers for moving their funds and to detect such misuse by law enforcement and financial institutions when it occurs.But in practice, the payer/payee data is either modified or not accessible to law enforcement at all.Let’s take a look at “wire stripping.” In plain English, this is when a bank employee willfully and knowingly changes the information on originator and/or beneficiary in the funds’ transfer message, usually sent via the SWIFT messaging service in cross-border payments. No criminals, sanctioned entities or countries are formally involved in the transaction, though in reality, they are.In the last decade, this practice has cost banks such as Standard Chartered, Deutsche Bank and UniCredit S.p.A hundreds of millions in fines to U.S. regulators.Moreover, it demonstrates that the current approach — checking names and addresses of payers/payees — does not prevent the bad actors from getting their money.In 2018 the U.S. government surprised compliance specialists by adding bitcoin addresses tied to two Iranian persons to the sanctions list. It appeared possible and feasible to attribute blockchain addresses for the purpose of further sanctions checks.The response from the industry was immediate: the next day blockchain analytics services added the listed addresses to their databases, and the same day everyone who uses their services got the ability to see (on the blockchain) the sanctioned funds and trace them, to the degree previously not available to investigators.The existing rule was drafted with the idea that the funds transfers require intermediaries and instructions in the form of messages which allow identifying the parties.Now, the value can be transferred peer-to-peer, without the intervention of intermediaries — correspondent banks, international payment systems, other clearing venues. It sounds blatant, but peering networks are here to stay.Of course, they brought freedoms, sometimes uncontrolled (and uncontrollable), but they also brought accountability — in the form of transparency, which, in case of financial transactions, means traceability. So, in the ideal blockchain world, anybody will know what everyone owns.I believe the solution will be found somewhere in between. If we demonstrate that sanctions can be effectively managed through funds tracing rather than applying the overloading screening process on both ends, we will succeed.Image via Shutterstock"

Burrell was taken to custody without bail last August, and later in October pleaded guilty that he had operated a bitcoin exchange without registering the business with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN).The dealer has now also been asked to pay a maximum fine of $250,000, according to Monday’s announcement.Burrell sold hundreds of thousands of dollars in bitcoin to over 1,000 customers, the Attorney’s Office said, adding that he advertised his business on LocalBitcoins.com, negotiated a commission of 5 percent above the prevailing exchange rate and accepted cash in person via ATMs and MoneyGram.Burrell has now admitted that he did not have any know-your-customer (KYC) or anti-money laundering (AML) procedures in place to perform due diligence on the source of his customers’ money.He has also admitted that he initially bought bitcoin through a regulated crypto exchange in the U.S. but later shifted to a Hong Kong-based exchange after his U.S. account was closed over suspicious transactions. He bought bitcoins worth $3.29 million via the Hong Kong exchange from March 2015 to April 2017.Finally, Burrell has admitted that he exchanged his U.S. dollars with a San Diego-based precious metals dealer Joseph Castillo, and that between late 2016 and early 2018, he and others imported a total of over $1 million in U.S. currency almost on a daily basis.Homeland Security Investigations’ special agent in charge, David Shaw, said:“[The] sentencing of Burrell is a reminder to those illegal and unlicensed money transmitters that the laws and rules apply to crypto currency dealings just as they do to other types of financial transactions.”U.S. Attorney Robert Brewer said: “The federal government will continue to investigate and prosecute all white collar criminals who refuse to comply with the anti-money laundering laws of the United States, and who assist others in avoiding scrutiny of their ill-gotten gains.”Bitcoin, gavel and handcuffs image via Shutterstock "

Just a month ago, it was at  2,072 PH/s.Bitmain, based in Beijing, manufactures mining equipment that it sells to others and also mines coins for itself. The firm started disclosing the hashrate of the machines it owns on a monthly basis in July of last year. Archived pages available online show that the hash rate was 1,692 PH/s that month, and then increased to 2,339 PH/s in October. This figure then dropped below 1,700 PH/s in March, in line with the overall decline of the bitcoin network’s total computing power since November of last year as bitcoin’s price plunged below $4,000 during the same period. It then climbed slightly in early April before the latest steep drop. Partly as a result of that drop, Bitmain’s share of the bitcoin network’s total computing power has also shrunk from four percent to now just 0.4 percent. Assuming all the hashing power comes from the more widely used AntMiner S9, each with a hash rate of 14 tera hashes per second (TH/s), Bitmain may have ceased using more than 130,000 machines to mine for itself. The cutback is notable since many miners in China have been gearing up to take advantage of cheap hydroelectric power during the coming rainy season. As recently as March, Bitmain was said to be planning to deploy $80 million worth of its own machines this summer.To be clear: none of this should be taken to mean Bitmain has shut down all its mining equipment. Even as the company’s share of computing power on the network has declined, the denominator has grown: bitcoin’s total hash power just reached a six-month high over 58,000 PH/s on May 2, according to data from blockchain.info. Meanwhile, the hash rate of the bitcoin cash network – which Bitmain has vocally supported – has been steady around 2,000 to 2,500 PH/s since early this year, data shows. When contacted by CoinDesk, a Bitmain spokesperson would not say what exactly led to the decrease in the firm’s hash rate. “It is [in the] natural course of the mining business where the hash rate owned by one body at one instant may be owned by someone else at another instant,” the spokesperson said. Also, Bitmain has been advertising a contract cloud mining service for retail customers called BitDeer that uses the company’s flagship AntMiner S15, S17 and S11 equipment, with many plans marked on the website as sold-out.Bitmain Antminer image via CoinDesk archives."

Microsoft saw Netscape as a threat and sabotaged it. Apple and AT&T similarly blocked Skype in the early days of the iPhone. There are countless other examples of platforms disfavoring complements or customers.Were regulators called in to save the day in all these cases? They were indeed. Telephone networks were designated as common carriers, which came with the obligation to provide non-discriminatory service; Microsoft was forced by antitrust regulators to abandon the practices that squeezed Netscape out of the market; and Apple and AT&T dropped their restrictions against Skype after the Federal Communications Commission threatened them with net neutrality action.It may seem that regulation came to the rescue whenever necessary to restore neutrality. But the truth is that despite occasional corrections, neutrality still remains the exception in the market and in regulatory action.Part of the reason is that the law actually acknowledges that non-neutrality is not all that bad. The ability to deviate from uniform practice is what allows companies to differentiate themselves in the market. Not all grocery stores carry the same products, neither do they all place them in the exact same shelf, and this helps consumers and producers address diversified needs.Even extreme differentiation, like exclusive agreements that make a business proposition unique in the market, can be good. For example, Nintendo’s exclusive console agreements helped bootstrap an entire industry by tying popular games to Nintendo’s consoles thereby increasing competition.It is not that this kind of discriminatory practices have no downsides. Far from it. But it is also a standard assumption in modern market-driven economies is that regulation distorts markets too, and therefore, the enactment of rules requires proof that, left alone, the market would perform demonstrably worse.To decide whether Binance, or any exchange for that matter, should be neutral and not discriminate against crypto assets (be it cryptocurrencies, crypto derivatives or other), regulators would consider a number of factors.Power

The most decisive factor to regulate is sustained monopoly power or dominance in the market.Regulators usually impose neutrality on platforms because users and/or complements (read: cryptocurrencies) can’t or realistically won’t turn to alternative platforms, which would allow the dominant platform to exploit them.If Binance were a monopoly exchange, then delisting a cryptocurrency would result in driving it out of the market. Or, if the cost of switching from Binance to another exchange was prohibitively high, then, similarly, Binance users and listed cryptocurrencies would be trapped by Binance’s choices.But neither of those conditions are true here. There are numerous exchanges on which Bitcoin SV can be traded, and signing up with Binance does not preclude users from trading on other exchanges too. In other words, both Bitcoin SV and users multi-home.In that sense, Bitcoin SV is not in the same position as companies listed on NYSE or Nasdaq, because by and large, companies are listed on only one exchange, and delisting them would mean that they cease to be publicly traded.Harm and market distortion

Regardless of power, would decisions such as Binance’s delisting of Bitcoin SV undermine important public interest goals such as market stability and efficiency, consumer and investor protection, and capital formation?Regulation is more likely if the problematic conduct threatens harm to public interest goals, is frequent, and has long-lasting effects without second-best alternatives being able to contain them.At the moment, the picture is still fluid. For one thing, regulators still grapple with the question of whether crypto assets even form part of financial markets. If they do not, then there would be no legal basis to subject exchanges to financial regulation.Assuming that they do, the frequency of the problematic conduct matters too. Crypto delisting is not unheard of but it is not exactly common either. There is no exact formula to calculate a threshold. In the case of network neutrality rules, fewer than five instances were enough to set the regulatory process in motion, whereas for privacy, numerous and repeated instances by tech giants have not resulted in regulation yet.We also don’t know the extent of the harm of delisting. When the trading of conventional securities is suspended, they effectively disappear from the market, perhaps permanently. On the other hand, despite Bitcoin SV’s delisting from Binance, it still traded on another seven exchanges.To be sure, Bitcoin SV’s price suffered significantly upon the announcement of the delisting on April 15 (from $73 on April 14 to $55 on April 15), and the effects to its medium-long term liquidity and reputation are yet to be accounted for (likely bleak).This, in turn, can have severe consequences for investors’ financial situation.But regulation is concerned with broad effects, not individual actors. The key lies less in the fate of Bitcoin SV specifically, and more in the effect of the practice of delisting in the overall stability of the market. It is a very different situation if delisting is regarded as a normal business practice whose risk is acceptably assumed by investors, and if delisting is regarded as serving no other purpose but to manipulate the market or to defraud investors. Only the latter could invite regulation.Information inadequacies

The market can only work efficiently if all parties are sufficiently well informed to evaluate their options.If investors had perfect information, then their reactions to Bitcoin SV’s delisting would reflect their up-to-date assessment, and there would be no need for regulation to protect them from anything. Any price, reputation and liquidity fluctuations would correspond to investors’ full and accurate beliefs and manipulation by Binance would be impossible.This is clearly not the case here or in any other market. Perfect information is one of the most unrealistic assumptions of neoclassical economics in modern economies.But the obvious solution to information inadequacies is more information and more transparency, not neutrality. The difference is that transparency enables actors to make a (presumably better) choice, whereas neutrality is a choice itself: it mandates a specific treatment (i.e. non-discrimination).Regulators would normally want to start with the least onerous measure (transparency). If it is not effective, they can escalate to neutrality. If still ineffective, they may even dictate the rules of listing and delisting themselves.Unequal bargaining power and anticompetitive conductThe main idea behind non-regulated competitive markets is that actors behave well because market forces discipline them. If, however, the competitive forces exercised by competitors (other exchanges), complements (cryptoassets) or customers (investors) are weak, market players (exchanges) are unconstrained to act in ways that harm others.Think about how much more difficult it would be for an exchange to delist Bitcoin with its much higher market capitalization, velocity and liquidity compared to Bitcoin SV.Evidently, Bitcoin is more valuable to exchanges and therefore the constraints around how exchanges treat it are tighter. In reality, the majority of cryptocurrencies are nowhere near as important as Bitcoin, and the fact that they are not backed by unified institutional actors further diminishes their bargaining power.Large investors could have a similar constraining effect, since exchanges would not want to lose investors who can generate large volumes.For this to work it would mean that cryptocurrency ownership is concentrated in large investors (there is evidence in that direction, for example 42 percent of Bitcoin is owned by the top 0.01 of addresses), but also that these investors are actually active and that churn is high or at least plausible.The factors listed above leave out one important aspect of regulation: the fact that, ultimately, it is a political game, not an academic exercise. If politics favor regulation then that’s the most likely outcome regardless of how the factors listed above weigh in. We even have a fancy name for it: New Institutionalism.As a function of the executive branch, regulation is subject to political pressure and revolves around interest groups. Nascent immature markets, such as that of cryptoassets, are usually captured by the interests of the existing regulatory authority and those of the public.They are captured by the existing authority (in the US, this is the SEC) because they are already in the game and by extending their reach they justify their existence. Widened reach and heightened activity entitles them to more funding and higher rating. Just look at how everyone speaks of the European Commission as the global antitrust and privacy enforcer after having gone after Google and the like.Nascent markets are also more likely to be regulated in the name of the public interest both because people are generally more vulnerable in new market contexts, and because industry interests have not developed lobbying capacity yet. This leaves the field clear to side with the public which is generally seen as the weaker side.A few industry associations are already present in blockchain markets (EEA, PTDL, ISDA) but none seems to represent the collective interests of exchanges. On the contrary, regulatory interest and grassroots support for crypto assets seem stronger.In the end, it is usually not a question of whether a market segment will be regulated or not; rather a question of how it will be regulated.Coin in vice via Shutterstock"

For the study, they crunched data covering a three-year span from January 2015 to January 2018.Of the three cryptos, they found bitcoin was the most discussed, with 3,600 comments posted each day. That’s far ahead of ethereum and monero, which had an average of 500 and 380 comments per day, respectively.The PNNL study, which was notably funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), also showed that people responded more quickly to bitcoin posts, taking an average of 11 minutes to start gathering comments.Posts about monero and ethereum, meanwhile, took on average 20 minutes and 27 minutes, respectively, for the discussion to kick off. Discussions on bitcoin were also the fastest to grow, followed by ethereum, then monero.All this is perhaps to be expected with bitcoin being the top cryptocurrency in terms of market cap and media exposure. However, there were more surprising findings.In terms of how long a post gets discussed, it was monero that came top with the largest median lifetime. Ethereum posts, on the other hand, had the largest possible lifetimes, while bitcoin discussions had the lowest median lifetime of the three coins.Bitcoin and ethereum also produced five times more ineffective posts – those that fail to garner any comments – than monero.The PNNL study, led by Dr. Svitlana Volkova, was launched to better understand online communication patterns and develop a quantitative framework for how such information propagates, according to the press release.Volkova said:“Cryptocurrencies are quite unique observable units of information in the way discussions about them spread across social platforms. … These social signals are quite useful, and by incorporating them with machine and deep learning, we intend to build predictive models that hit on causal relationships between different variables so we can explain model decision-making processes.”PNNL further said that the analysis presented in its study could be used to inform a variety of financial market analytics. The lab intends to expand its research on the spread of cryptocurrency discussions with other viral trends, such as the spread of computer vulnerabilities and misinformation.The PNNL study was presented at the Web Conference 2019 in San Francisco, California on May 17 and can be found online here.Reddit image via Shutterstock"

This will definitely happen,” Draper said.While it is not clear if the President agreed to the bet, the venture capitalist assured journalists that the proposal was a joke.“People are going to choose bitcoin over pesos when they see all they can do with bitcoin. That’s why I made the prediction and then the bet as a joke with the President,” Draper said.Draper is bullish on Argentina but is worried about the President’s future.“His popularity is going down,” Draper said during the panel.The Argentinian peso is currently facing a projected 36% devaluation by the end of 2019. Macri’s government also faces a public debt rise of 77 percent, the highest in Latin America. According to Draper, the solution lies in making Argentina open to investment.“The only way to grow is to be the country all the entrepreneurs want to go to. This is one of those moments when a President can have an important impact on his country,” Draper said.On the other hand, the investor does have great expectations for the Argentinian startup industry and invested $3 million so far into Argentinian entrepreneurship.According to Draper, a real investment in Argentina’s tech infrastructure is key. He told the South American leader that the implementation of 5G wireless in the country was imperative.“I think it’s time to attract investors and venture capital to continue the progress, otherwise the status quo remains and it could lead to a collapse,” Draper said."

Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Jun 13, 2019 at 09:05 UTC",Noted cybersecurity expert and eccentric crypto fan John McAfee has just launched a cryptocurrency trading platform.,"Dubbed “Magic,” the site is touted as allowing users to “trade cryptocurrencies on multiple exchanges within a single dashboard, automatically and manually.”Notably, the exchange appears to be non-custodial, with users’ crypto holdings remaining on eight other exchange platforms. When a trade is executed, funds are transferred from those accounts to complete the transaction. To set this up, users will need to plug in APIs from their other exchanges.In its guide to using the platform, Magic lists Binance, Kraken, Poloniex, Huobi, Bittrex, HitBtc, Exmo and Livecoin as the supported exchanges.Two “portals” are on offer, one for normal spot trading, the other for “shadow trading,” in which a user’s trades will be set to mimic those of pro-level traders who are “ranked by the community by their trading success,” McAfee indicated in a tweeted image.Other features include the “set and forget” ability to set buy and sell orders at the same time. Users can also use the platform to make auto trades on their behalf. There are no jurisdictional restrictions on who can use the exchange.Regarding the security on offer, the Magic’s FAQs say that the site is hosted on “top grade” Amazon Web Service servers that come with DDoS protection and can “scale on demand.”The site also reads: “We are only releasing this platform to the public after extensive testing and auditing processes that stretched months.”Magic seems to have faced a DDoS attack even before launch. In a pre-launch tweet, McAfee quipped:“McAfeeMagic.com still under attack. New I.P. address in Texas. The more this goes on, the closer we get. Amazon AWS servers are “learning” the attack and will be up shortly. Catch up on work, make out with your partner or “flash” a random stranger and video while you wait.”It should be noted, we don’t recommend taking his advice.Just 10 days ago, McAfee also announced he would launch a cryptocurrency dubbed the “McAfee Freedom Coin” this autumn.Somewhat confusingly, he said at the time:“The McAfee Freedom Coin is designed to confront the problem of exchange head-on… It is not based on any commodity nor is it connected to the value or behavior of any external item or entity. The value of the coin will always be zero in relation to any other currency yet it’s natural market value is free, completely, to grow.”However, the token does not seem to be linked to the operation of new exchange, at least not yet.

Charging small fees on such swaps is how the startup turns a profit.“Doing the stablecoin project here with PAX is a really big deal because it’s not just that we are adding a new asset, it’s adding a true dollar balance into the wallet,” Baynham-Herd said of the company’s first stablecoin integration, adding:“Anyone with an internet connection can download a wallet and get USD funds, essentially. … People everywhere can now have access to all sorts of assets the same way they can access all sorts of information.”By Monday, users will already be able to swap assets like bitcoin, ether or stellar for PAX within the wallet itself.While Baynham-Herd declined to say when fiat and traditional assets might be scheduled to arrive, demand for such offerings is already starting to percolate. PAX issuer Paxos, a New York-based startup, also has a commodities-focused operation near Blockchain’s London headquarters.Paxos CEO Chad Cascarilla told CoinDesk the company’s blockchain-based precious metals trading system has already settled $700 billion worth of trades with 55 institutions since it launched roughly 10 months ago. In the near future, Paxos will also launch a new, gold-pegged asset called Pax Gold, which can be redeemed for physical bars of gold from a London warehouse.Baynham-Herd said Blockchain is open to exploring options like Pax Gold, in addition to other stablecoins beyond PAX, because it will allow traditional assets to transcend national borders the way bitcoin already does. Such partnerships could have widespread implications for retail users.Stepping back, Blockchain’s wallets account for 22 percent of all on-chain bitcoin transactions, according to a tweet by Blockchain CEO Peter Smith. Yet the ways Blockchain collects demographic information about these transactions is considered, by some, to be controversial.Baynham-Herd said there are roughly 38 million wallet signups and millions of active monthly users, more than half of whom are located outside the United States. Baynham-Herd said Russia, Nigeria, Brazil and Argentina are home to some of the company’s largest user bases.Like many wallet providers, Blockchain wallets aggregate IP information based on the users’ internet connection. Blockchain also provides optional know-your-customer (KYC) verification for users who want in-wallet trading capabilities or access to perks like the stellar airdrop last November. The company says it now verifies “tens of thousands of KYC users per day.”Bitcoin advocate Udi Wertheimer told CoinDesk he would prefer Blockchain to prioritize Tor integrations and encourage users to do KYC with new accounts instead.“Potentially linking years of bitcoin activity to real-world identity just to get $5-worth of stellar doesn’t bode well for the privacy of end-users,” Wertheimer said.Speaking to this criticism, Baynham-Herd said: “We only collect very minimal information on users.”In the meantime, a company spokesperson said Blockchain is hiring aggressively, growing from roughly 60 employees to around 150 over the past year and looking for nearly 50 more positions this summer.“We’re always hiring,” Baynham-Herd confirmed, adding:“Engineers, product, trading-related positions, the whole spectrum.”Blockchain CEO Peter Smith image via CoinDesk archives"

Israeli news outlet Ynet reports the two allegedly stole over $100 million in cryptocurrency.","The infamous Bitfinex theft of 119,756 BTC shocked the crypto market with the largest loss of bitcoins by an exchange since the Mt. Gox breach in early 2014.Earlier this month, some of the stolen bitcoin were recorded moving from wallets connected with the hack, after three years of lying dormant.Israeli crime news portal Posta reported that several several cyber units across the globe are cooperating in an effort to retrieve the missing funds. The majority of compromised accounts were from users in the U.S. and E.U. In February, Bitfinex announced that some of the stolen bitcoin – 27.66270285 – were returned after being retrieved by the U.S. government.The Gigi brothers Eli, 31, and Assaf, 21, also allegedly constructed a phishing scheme that involved luring investors from crypto trading forums, such as Telegram or Reddit, onto websites that mimicked prominent crypto exchanges. They would collect the traders’ login and wallet information and use it to transfer the funds stored on legitimate exchanges to their own accounts.Police allege they may have used other tactics as well, including dropping links to wallet management software that once downloaded would allow access to the victim’s funds.During a raid of Eli’s house the Israeli police seized one of his crypto wallets, which contained less than the suspected total of stolen funds. They also found two luxury cars.Eli is a former computer science expert in the IDF, which one reddit user said “would be Unit 8200, the largest military branch in the Israeli army. It specializes in hacking, spying and creating computer viruses (Stuxnet) – many of them are now employed by Google, Microsoft and Coinbase.”Eli said in court, as reported by Posta, “I was wrong, I came from a bad place.

While this exchange is not cooperating with EY, it is ...","Jun 20, 2019 at 11:05 UTC","QuadrigaCX’s late founder and CEO used customers’ funds to trade for his own account on other cryptocurrency exchanges, the Canadian firm’s bankruptcy trustee said.","In a bombshell 70-page report released Wednesday, Ernst & Young claimed that Gerald Cotten, who apparently died last December, transferred millions of dollars in crypto out of customer accounts and into other exchanges, with the funds being used to furnish Cotten’s personal lifestyle and trading habits. Overall, it appears that Cotten effectively stole more than $200 million USD from his customers.“Significant volumes of Cryptocurrency were transferred off Platform outside Quadriga to competitor exchanges into personal accounts controlled by Mr. Cotten,” the report said. “It appears that User Cryptocurrency was traded on these exchanges and in some circumstances used as security for a margin trading account established by Mr. Cotten.”Fees and trading losses “appear to have adversely affected Quadriga’s cryptocurrency reserves,” while other sums were sent to wallets whose owners EY could not confirm.Between 2016 and the end of 2018, Cotten transferred 9,450 bitcoin, 387,738 ethereum and 239,020 litecoin out of his exchange’s accounts (respectively, $88 million, $105 million and $33 million USD at present market prices, though their values have fluctuated – and increased dramatically – over that time).Cotten also appears to have created fake accounts on Quadriga, credited them with fiat amounts that did not actually exist, and use this fake fiat to purchase actual crypto from customers, with the largest account using the name Chris Markay.Later, the report says that Cotten margin traded zcash, dash, dogecoin and omisego, where he “generated substantial losses.”An unidentified third exchange received 21,501 bitcoin ($201 million in today’s prices) into an account under Cotten’s name. All but 8 bitcoin were liquidated, netting some $80 million CAD ($60.4 million USD).While this exchange is not cooperating with EY, it is cooperating with local authorities in its jurisdiction. EY is now looking to open “formal channels” with these authorities.Evan Thomas, a litigator with Osler Hoskin & Harcourt in Canada, told CoinDesk that “based on the report, what [Cotten] did was clearly fraudulent and betrayed the trust of Quadriga users.”Cotten’s actions could not have been an accident, Thomas indicated, saying:“It’s possible that he got in over his head and was trying to trade his way out out of a deficit using other people’s money, but given that the fake accounts have existed since at least 2016 and he misappropriated funds for luxury travel and real estate investments, it seems more likely that this was a calculated and deliberate fraud.”QuadrigaCX filed for protection from creditors in January, owing customers $190 million worth of crypto and fiat, most of which it could not access because only its late CEO Gerald Cotten knew where the private keys were.EY’s hunt for the missing funds, first as court-appointed monitor and then as trustee when QuadrigaCX formally entered bankruptcy in April, has largely been fruitless.As of May, the estate had just $21 million of assets to cover $160 million in remaining liabilities, though the most recent report brings the sum closer to $24.5 million.The U.S. FBI is looking into the losses, as are Canadian authorities.EY’s report also detailed rampant mismanagement and poor practices, noting that Quadriga did not keep administrative logs and had no contingency plan for the loss of funds or its leader.What’s more, the exchange seemingly engaged in poor accounting practices.For example, the exchange paid two of its nine payment processors $11.8 million CAD (roughly $9 million USD) in fees alone.Quadriga did not maintain any documentation, however.“The Monitor has been unable to locate any accounting with respect to the pooled Quadriga Funds,” the report said. “The Monitor notes the TPP accounts were used to process User Fiat transactions, fund general Quadriga operating costs and on multiple occasions funds were directed to Mr. Cotten, parties related to Mr. Cotten or counsel/parties acting on his behalf.”It went on to add:“It appears that as and when operating expenses were required to be paid, or when Mr. Cotten desired funds to be transferred to himself or related parties, he simply instructed TPPs to issue payments with no oversight.”EY also believes that properties in Nova Scotia, properties in British Columbia, investment securities, cash holdings, a boat, an aircraft, luxury vehicles and gold and silver coins that purportedly belonged to Cotten, and now belong to his widow Jennifer Robertson were paid for using Quadriga’s customers’ funds, and therefore should be liquidated.“As Mr. Cotten’s and Ms. Robertson’s personal expenditures and the accumulation of their personal assets since 2015 was sourced from Quadriga funds, the Trustee intends to seek the recovery of the Preserved Assets subject to the Asset Preservation Order back to the Estate for immediate liquidation on the basis that the funds which Mr. Cotten directed be paid to them constitute preferences or transactions at under value under the BIA and may be subject to other causes of action asserted by the Trustee,” EY wrote.The proceeds from these sales, if successful, will go to the creditors’ estate, and could total as much as $12 million CAD ($9 million USD).In a separate filing, EY outlined the process that former QuadrigaCX users who lost money when the exchange went belly-up should follow to file claims.“Users will be requested to complete and deliver their Proofs of Claim to the Trustee prior to 5:00 p.m. (Halifax time) on August 31, 2019 (the ‘Claims Submission Date’),” EY said.EY acknowledged in the filing that creditors have encountered difficulty finding the information they need to prepare claims because Quadriga’s website has been down since January.A committee and lawyers representing users “have expressed concern with the platform site being offline as Users cannot access statement details or information necessary to complete their claims,” EY said.In response, EY says it worked with the creditors’ lawyer to help users find ways to retrieve account balance information.That process involves an online portal where users are asked to type in their QuadrigaCX account number and first name.“If a match is found, your balances will be displayed,” the EY-built web page says, warning: “Be sure to print or screen capture the results.”The auditing firm has also modified the standard form for bankruptcy claims “in order to fit Quadriga’s unique circumstances of having claims against it denominated in Cryptocurrency and Fiat,” EY said.The form, which misspells the word “ethereum” and is interrupted by a page break in the filing, looks like this:Thomas told CoinDesk that based on the new reports, there may not be much for customers to recover.“Right now, it looks like the primary source of recovery for creditors will be the fiat and the frozen assets,” he said, concluding:“The report doesn’t address potential damages claims against other parties but that may be something the trustee will consider.”Nova Scotia

So, even ...","Apr 24, 2019 at 21:00 UTC","Imagine this: Alice is one of the “reckless” users testing a new, risky technology.","She’s excited about the potential for bitcoin’s lightning, a technology that advocates hope will bring bitcoin payments to the masses. So, even though developers tell her it’s risky to do so, she’s running the technology on a little computer called a Raspberry Pi anyway, even using it to buy pizza.But Alice’s Raspberry Pi is having trouble, so she reboots her node to fix the problem. But when she turns it back on, she finds that a very important file had become corrupted when the computer shut down.And now, all of Alice’s funds are gone.This troubling problem with lightning has happened to at least a few users. And it’s one of the reasons using lightning today is considered not exactly safe to use. But thousands of users are ignoring this advice, sending payments across the network to see how the novel technology works in action.Luckily, the sixth major release of the lightning implementation LND, released just last week, aims to solve this problem by putting into place the change “static backup channels” as coded by Lightning Labs CTO Olaoluwa Osuntokun.As it stands, the fate of a user’s money hinges on one file.“What happens if your channel.db file gets corrupted? It’s pretty simple: All the funds in your channels are lost,” an explainer article from earlier this month by developer Patrick Lemke reads.As Suredbits CEO Chris Stewart, who has also put together research on the topic, put it in conversation with CoinDesk:“Computers are finicky. Maybe your file system is deleted and you’re like shit, how do I get this money back?”In practice, Osuntokun noted to CoinDesk that this mostly has happened to lightning enthusiasts using Raspberry Pis, which are little hardware devices that cost roughly $30 and are an easy way to stand up a lightning node at a low entry cost.Losing money in this way is not very common, Stewart notes, but he argues that developers are working on “worse case planning.”There are three main implementations of lightning so far (including Blockstream’s c-lightning and Acinq’s Eclair) all of which have implemented this sort of a backup scheme in some form or another.LND’s new technology generates a second copy of the important file, allowing users to save an extra version of their lightning wallet file elsewhere, to minimize the risk of it getting lost or “corrupted,” meaning the data was accidentally altered, like staining a drip of coffee on a white shirt.This is comparable to backing up all your computer files periodically to ensure they’re safe even if the laptop takes its last steps or gets stolen.With bitcoin, each transaction is stored in the blockchain, on thousands of nodes across the world. But with lightning, the off-chain transaction data is stored on your computer – and your computer alone. If you lose or “corrupt” the file storing state of the channels, then those funds are lost for good.Another related scenario: if you accidentally use an old version of the channel.db, which turns out to have the wrong information, then your peer will probably think you’re cheating. Thus, you’ll be penalized, losing money.That’s why this new backup code is so important. To ensure safety of funds, a user needs to save their channel.db backup file in more than one place at once.“If you run the latest version of LND your node will automatically create a backup of all the bits of information that you need to rescue your channels in case your channel.db file is lost,” Lemke explains.“We say safe, as care has been taken to ensure that there are no foot guns in this method of backing up channels, vs doing things like rsync ing or copying the channel.db file periodically. Those methods can be dangerous as one never knows if they have the latest state of a channel or not. Instead, we aim to provide a simple safe instead to allow users to recover the settled funds in their channels in the case of partial or complete data loss,” Osuntokun explains in the “pull request” where he first proposed the change.That said, Lemke stresses that users running the old lightning code are still at risk.“If you run an older version of LND your channels are not [safe] and you should be aware that you are at risk of losing your funds if your disk gets corrupted,” he wrote.So, now that this code has been pushed through, is the problem solved?Not exactly. As you can see, it’s still a bit of a process for backing up the files. While the infrastructure LND puts into place automatically generates a backup file for users, the user still has to be technical enough to configure where to put it.Not to mention, Stewart and Cohen point out one problem with the scheme: it’s not completely trustless. Using this backup scheme, a malicious node could steal a counterparty’s funds.This feature is “good for the average user who’s willing to trust that their peer is not malicious,” Suredbits software engineer Nadav Cohen told CoinDesk, while Stewart noted that the backup solution should work “99% of the time.”But Stewart also highlighted how Suredbits has been working a lot with different exchanges that are looking to eventually adopt lightning.“For exchanges, they absolutely need to a [trustless backup scheme]. They’re dealing with lots of money and don’t want to have the risk of losing a lot of funds,” Stewart said.Osuntokun has this scenario in mind too, noting that Lightning Labs developers are currently building out a feature that works even when a user is dealing with a malicious peer. In the meantime though, they released static backup channels, since they wanted to push out something that works for the most part.“This infrastructure will be built out in the near future, but until then we have this scheme which will also be a fall back in the scenario that any higher level mechanisms fail,” Osuntokun explained.In other words, there’s still building to be done.“We’re not there yet,” as Stewart puts it, arguing there will be more of a need for this kind of feature in the future once people are using the network for even more money.“With wumbo, people will start transacting more. We need to be concerned in that case,” he added, referencing a Spongebob Squarepants-inspired technology that will one day allow people to transfer even more money across lightning.But once developers get this scheme working, Cohen argues that it shouldn’t be hard to put something into place that’s easier for users.He said:“Backups are in the early stages and it’s a solvable problem. Once we have something that works and doesn’t require trust, I don’t doubt that we can make them better as far as latency.”Burning bitcoin image via Shutterstock"

Each of the new backers will invest roughly $10 million in the project as part of a governing consortium for the cryptocurrency.Stripe, Booking.com and MercadoLibre are part of the project, according to the Journal, though the report does not specify what their roles are.Facebook announced it was launching GlobalCoin last December, though the company indicated that it was looking at cryptocurrency as far back as the end of 2017. The crypto is expected to be a stablecoin that will operate within the company’s messaging infrastructure – WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook Messenger.However, Facebook has been tight-lipped about what exactly GlobalCoin will be used for, though the BBC suggested that Facebook may look to retailers, allowing its users to purchase discounted goods using the cryptocurrency. The cryptocurrency would be used to transfer value directly from Facebook to the retailer, cutting out credit card companies in the middle, which BBC suggests would help the retailers’ profits.GlobalCoin is now expected to be unveiled on June 18.Facebook image via Shutterstock"

“probably rat poison squared” is one of his more colourful descriptions.","Jun 16, 2019 at 09:21 UTC",Noelle Acheson is a veteran of company analysis and a member of CoinDesk’s product team. The opinions expressed in this article are the author’s own.,"The following article originally appeared in Institutional Crypto by CoinDesk, a free newsletter for institutional investors interested in cryptoassets, with news and views on crypto infrastructure delivered every Tuesday. Sign up here.Justin Sun, founder of the Tron blockchain, has paid $4.57 million for the privilege of having lunch with legendary investor Warren Buffett.News outlets around the world picked up this news, trumpeting it as yet another example of how ridiculous the crypto sector can be.The gesture is attention-grabbing, true, and not just because $4.57 million is a lot to pay for a meal and a couple of hours of someone’s time. It’s also worthy of a jaw drop given Buffett’s public opinion of bitcoin: “probably rat poison squared” is one of his more colourful descriptions.However, the real event here is being overlooked. Thanks to Sun’s largesse, two extremes of the current investment landscape will sit at the same table and talk to each other. This is more significant than most of us realise.First, let’s look at the extremes that these two ambassadors represent.Warren Buffett is CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, a U.S.-based conglomerate with over $700 billion in assets, including a handful of large enterprises in insurance, transport and consumer goods, a portfolio of minority holdings in household names such as Coca Cola and Wells Fargo, a sizeable equity portfolio, and over $110 billion of cash equivalents.One of the richest men in the world, Buffett made his fortune investing in solid companies with definable markets and tangible profits. He has often said that he doesn’t invest in businesses he doesn’t understand, and it wasn’t until 2011 that he took his first stake in a tech company, IBM, a position that did not do well. In 2017, he bought shares in Apple, which now accounts for the largest position in his equity portfolio. And last month, he revealed a small holding in Amazon.At the other end of the table, we have Justin Sun, an experienced entrepreneur and former Ripple representative, who has built a large ecosystem around a global entertainment platform based on a distributed storage blockchain. Not exactly in Buffett’s wheelhouse, especially since the main use case so far seems to be for gambling, something Buffett has spoken out against in the past.Tron has been criticized for its outlandish publicity stunts, questionable governance and even plagiarism. In spite of that, however, the network’s token TRX has amassed a liquid market cap of over $2 billion, placing it in the top 10 of crypto assets.Can you think of two more different lunch partners?Now let’s pick our jaws up off the floor and look at what this meeting represents.On the one hand, it’s a master publicity stunt for Tron and could well end up being cheap at the price. Sun’s name has since graced headlines in mainstream press around the world. While the tone of the reporting may be of incredulity and perhaps even scorn, his name has appeared in the same sentence as Buffett’s in every single article. The two are now associated in the minds of not just investors who read the financial press, but also of a good part of the world’s population.On the other hand, it’s also good publicity for Buffett, not that he needs it. Affectionately referred to in many outlets as “America’s favorite capitalist,” Buffett has come under criticism recently for his underperformance of the S&P500 over the past 10 years, in spite of handsome outperformance for the previous 30, and for having totally missed the tech boom.With this lunch, the proceeds of which will go to charity, Buffett has shown himself to be gracious and generous. Several well-known commentators tut-tutted that they wouldn’t want to be in his shoes, but Buffett issued a public statement through a spokesperson saying that he was looking forward to the opportunity. Buffett is far from stupid and may well be intrigued by the chance to hear about a totally foreign concept from one of its most high-profile promoters.This brings us to where this meeting might lead.No-one expects Buffett to emerge from the meal a converted crypto evangelist. If he has struggled to understand tech companies (as he puts it) and their focus on revenue growth at the expense of profits, then it’s very unlikely he will appreciate the value in a new type of asset that has no tangible backing, no defined governance and no established income streams.Nor will it produce a Buffett-backed investment in crypto, even as an experiment. Berkshire Hathaway is a public company and its annual general meeting is a massive event, with over 40,000 people travelling from far and wide to question the board on their investment decisions. Imagine them having to justify putting shareholders’ money into “magic internet beans.”What’s more, Buffett has in the past highlighted how hard it is to find viable investments with so much money on hand. The number of listed equities in which he could feasibly invest is limited to around 100, simply because of liquidity concerns and operational considerations.With over $700 billion of assets under management and over $100 billion of “dry powder” (cash that needs to find a profitable home), even a $1 billion investment that produces a 500% return in one year won’t be enough to “move the needle” on the portfolio’s overall performance. Smaller investments, no matter how enticing, are not worth the hassle. And a larger investment in even the most liquid of crypto assets would send the market reeling – not something a smart investor would do.The ideal outcome of the lunch is actually the most likely: that Buffett is less dismissive of the concept of crypto assets than before.This is likely because Buffett recognizes that he has made mistakes in dismissing entire sectors before. “We blew it,” is how he explained his lack of tech investments so far. Given his personal emphasis on lifelong education, we can expect him to at least listen to Sun.And it won’t just be to Sun. The entrepreneur’s bold statements, confusing business strategy and apparent lack of concern for regulatory issues (see the interview our editor-in-chief Pete Rizzo did with him on the main stage at Consensus 2019) will most likely mean that Buffett won’t take him very seriously. But Sun is allowed to invite seven other guests and will hopefully choose ones that can explain crypto assets’ role in the evolution of finance with clarity and sobriety. Virtually all of Crypto Twitter has been jostling for position.Sun is likely to choose well, since association with leading crypto thinkers is part of the stunt. While the rest of us will fantasize about being a fly on that wall, we can be fairly confident that the conversation will be both dense and conceptual.We can also marvel at the genius of the idea. Whatever you may think of Sun, Tron and the outlook for decentralized entertainment, there is no way that this move doesn’t help the crypto sector. Worst case, Buffett is unmoved and continues to think bitcoin is a “delusion.” From what I gather, his opinion could not go lower than it already is.Best case, Buffett emerges with an acknowledgement, however reluctant, that maybe there’s more to this than he realized. That would send a strong signal to institutional investors everywhere that dismissal without at least some investigation is short-sighted and foolish.Total victory would be for Warren Buffett to publicly recognize that he doesn’t understand enough about cryptocurrency to have an informed opinion… yet.Warren Buffett image via Krista Kennell / Shutterstock.com"

In addition to verifying and keeping records of their users’ identities, exchanges and other service providers would have to pass customer information to each other when transferring funds, just as banks are required to do – a procedure known in the U.S. as the “travel rule.”Blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis recently argued that the expected changes, as set out in a draft document in February, would be unrealistic and harmful for the crypto industry.The G20, however considers the threat from crypto assets low, and recognizes their potential. The group said in the communique:“Technological innovations, including those underlying crypto-assets, can deliver significant benefits to the financial system and the broader economy. While crypto-assets do not pose a threat to global financial stability at this point, we remain vigilant to risks, including those related to consumer and investor protection, anti-money laundering (AML) and countering the financing of terrorism (CFT). “It’s also seeking possible additional measures, calling for the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and “other standard setting bodies to monitor risks and consider work on additional multilateral responses as needed.” The G20 welcomed the FSB’s directory of crypto-asset regulators, published in April, and its report on ongoing work, regulatory approaches and potential “gaps” in crypto-asset regulation.Finally, addressing the issue of hacks in the crypto space, the G20 said:“We also continue to step up efforts to enhance cyber resilience, and welcome progress on the FSB’s initiative to identify effective practices for response to and recovery from cyber incidents.”Japanese flag image via Shutterstock"

firm to offer physically settled bitcoin futures contracts. The company ...","Apr 15, 2019 at 14:00 UTC",Cryptocurrency derivatives provider LedgerX plans to become the first U.S. firm to offer physically settled bitcoin futures contracts.,"The company announced Monday that it has filed for a designated contract market (DCM) license, which would allow LedgerX to offer physically-settled bitcoin futures products to its customers. Unlike the cash-settled bitcoin futures offered by CME Group (and previously, Cboe), customers would receive the actual bitcoin underlying a contract after it expires, rather than the U.S. dollar equivalent.And perhaps more notably, LedgerX can target retail investors with its new offering, said Juthica Chou, who serves as both chief risk and operating officer at LedgerX.“We’ll be able to service customers of any size, we won’t be restricted to [institutional clients],” Chou told CoinDesk.Once approved, LedgerX will offer bitcoin, bitcoin options and bitcoin futures to retail customers through a new platform, dubbed Omni.Omni, built on LedgerX’s existing infrastructure, will act as the provider for both custody and trading services. LedgerX’s original platform first received regulatory approval to launch in July 2017, though the platform itself only went live later that year.The new platform will also utilize LedgerX’s existing institutional liquidity pool to “offer retail customers a top tier experience from day one,” Chou said.Launching a retail platform with futures offerings has “always been our plan,” Chou said. The company first began offering physically-settled derivatives products in October 2017, trading $1 million in its first week.“Once the platform had proved stable and we got an operational cadence, we filed for a license with the CFTC,” Chou said, adding:“For us this is a philosophically important move because bitcoin is available to everyone and we … really wanted to make our derivatives products available to all investors as well.”The company filed for a license to offer futures contracts in November 2018, and has been engaged in a “constructive dialogue” with the CFTC since, Chou said. However, she could not comment on a timeline for when the CFTC might approve LedgerX’s application, or on what sort of reception the firm is expecting from customers.The CFTC has already granted LedgerX two licenses, allowing the firm to act as a Swap Execution Facility (SEF), which is the company’s exchange platform, and a Derivatives Clearing Organization (DCO), which is the clearinghouse.LedgerX’s DCM application is therefore just an additional license on top of its existing permissions. Operationally, the company is already set up to provide futures services, according to Chou.She continued:“We’re custodying [bitcoin] in the same way that we currently do, we’ve obviously been live and operational for more than a year and a half, and we have a license from the CFTC, the DCO license, that allows us to custody bitcoin.”Since its launch, LedgerX has provided institutions with regulated physically-settled bitcoin swaps and options products, and claims some 200 different firms as customers.While CME and Cboe both began offering cash-settled bitcoin futures in December 2017, no company has launched a physically-settled equivalent to date – though that’s not for lack of trying.Several major firms plan to launch physically-settled bitcoin futures contracts, including Bakkt, the firm built by New York Stock Exchange parent Intercontinental Exchange; Seed CX, the crypto exchange backed by Bain Capital Ventures; and ErisX, a startup backed by brokerage TD Ameritrade.However, all of these firms, too, are awaiting their own regulatory approvals, giving LedgerX a shot at being the first to go live with an actual product.“This is a natural evolution and it stems from the fact that we’ve been operating a physically settled market for more than a year and a half so it’s been a natural [extension],” Chou said. “We’re always excited to be the first.”Juthica Chou image via CoinDesk archives"

The purchase offer, payment and deeds are uploaded to an immutable blockchain.“The traditional real estate sale process is arduous and broken. Buyers, sellers, and their professional support struggle with overly complex interactions – it’s an opaque, dated, and unnecessarily lengthy process, full of risks such as wire fraud,” said Arrington, founder of TechCrunch, whose most recent venture is into blockchain capital investments and management with his $100m firm, Arrington XRP Capital.“When it comes to expensive property or other expensive goods, these normally already have digital presentation of ownership, that’s why blockchain is applicable to space,” said CEO Natalia Karayaneva. “Blockchain’s main implications, after [virtual] money, is as a technology that enables ownership transfers… it aligns the entire process of any value transfer including real estate.”Propy completed its first deal in 2017, and its first US transaction in Vermont 12 months ago. Worldwide, they have assisted in some form in over 60 real estate transfers. This includes auctioning a 17th century Italian mansion and UNESCO site on its blockchain.The median price of a house sold on its platform is around $1.5 million, said Karayaneva, though the value of the houses is steadily increasing. About 20 realtors have closed deals on the platform, though 3,000 have signed up.Karayaneva believes in two or three years the majority of real estate transactions will be entirely digitized. The company is working with county governments to provide technology that automatically and immediately reports the transfer of title deeds.“We don’t want to work against them. Either we help them or will eliminate them,” she said.The venture capital arm of the U.S. National Association of Realtors (NAR) recently invested an undisclosed amount in Propy via its REACH accelerator program. The company also raised $15.5 million via an initial coin offering in 2017.Arrington previously purchased a $60,000 apartment in Kiev through Propy, using ethereum and smart contracts to settle the deal.Sold house image via Shutterstock"

Research. News; Learn; Research. Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Jun 26, 2019 at 04:00 UTC","Facebook published plans for the Libra cryptocurrency in seven languages, including Indonesia’s Bahasa – a move that offers perhaps the clearest glimpse of what Facebook’s fintech ascent might look like.","“Indonesia has the fourth-highest number of Facebook users in the world,” Pang Xue Kai, co-founder of the Indonesian crypto exchange Tokocrypto, told CoinDesk. “If Facebook’s Libra can address the [local] issues, it has the potential to succeed.”According to the annual media report released by We Are Social and Hootsuite, Indonesia has the world’s highest rate of Facebook post engagement among internet users, over 4 percent, and the highest frequency of online shopping, with 86 percent of Indonesian survey respondents saying they bought something online in the past month.Since nearly 10 percent of Indonesian respondents said they also own some cryptocurrency, double American percentage, Facebook couldn’t have dreamed up a better market for Libra.QCP Capital co-founder Joshua Ho, a trader who works closely with Indonesian exchange Tokocrypto, told CoinDesk Facebook’s Libra ecosystem could be a “gamechanger” in Indonesia.“People are already very aligned with mobile payments,” Ho said. “It is geographically decentralized. Creating banking access is a huge challenge.”Since the Asian financial crisis in 1997, which sparked rampant inflation, economic recession and political turmoil in Indonesia, Ho said cryptocurrency offers an attractive alternative to fiat currencies and banks the population still distrusts.Add all this to the World Bank’s estimate that Indonesia is a collection of islands with one of the world’s largest unbanked populations, 97 million adults as of 2017, and it’s clear why Facebook prioritized publishing its crypto materials in the native language.Anchorage CEO Nathan McCauley, a founding member of the Libra Association, told CoinDesk getting merchants to accept Libra will be a crucial part of encouraging adoption among the unbanked. The Andreessen Horowitz–backed startup will primarily contribute to security and custody features for the Libra ecosystem, especially custody services related to the Libra investment token for institutional investors.McCauley said Anchorage is currently applying for various licenses, but declined to specify which. He said he did not believe the association or its members would require additional licenses for money transmission or custody features for retail users in various jurisdictions.Although Facebook’s dominance across Indonesia’s communication networks is growing rapidly, accessibility can still be hindered by government intervention.“Of course the platform that facilitated a transaction is going to know who the transaction is coming from, who it is going to, and will have the ability to enforce whatever norms, laws or regulations that they need to do so,” McCauley said. “That tends to be jurisdiction dependent and client dependent.”Facebook’s omnipresence in Indonesia raises questions about how Libra will impact retail users.For example, TechCrunch reported the Indonesian government censored access to WhatsApp and Instagram, both owned by Facebook, in May when protests about controversial election results turned violent. Numerous reports have called Facebook a political “battleground” in Indonesia, where data from over a million user accounts was reportedly sold to Cambridge Analytica for targeted political campaigns.A Facebook spokesperson declined to comment on how relations with local authorities evolved since the protests in May, focusing instead on partnerships forged with six fact-checking entities certified by the Poynter Institute to quell the spread of misinformation among Indonesian users.This type of scenario raises red flags for Cornell University professor and blockchain researcher Emin Gun Sirer.“I did not see anything in their roadmap related to privacy at all,” he told CoinDesk about the Libra Association. “I don’t think people are talking about how aggressive the Facebook approach is.”A blog post by the crypto startup Nym went even further. Nym’s CTO, Dave Hrycyszyn, was briefly with the social media giant after the acqui-hire of Chainspace, a startup he co-founded.“Libra will provide Facebook and its partners with the ability to analyze every purchase by every single Libra user,” the blog post said:“While Facebook currently promises that it will not triangulate its vast hordes of personal data with financial transaction information to probe ever deeper into the minds of its human subjects, there are no cryptographic or technical privacy guarantees in Libra to prevent Facebook from doing exactly this.”Mass reliance on the same provider for mobile communication and financial access would give Silicon Valley even more leverage in markets like Indonesia.CoinDesk contributor Daniel Evans noted Facebook’s Libra Association doesn’t have any partners in the region yet and may not be able to operate “freely.”Shaun Djie, co-founder of Tokocrypto’s Singapore-based partner, DigixGlobal, told CoinDesk the fintech ecosystem in Indonesia is currently “very malleable” as young people are “receptive to owning cryptocurrencies.” In general, crypto veterans with experience in the Indonesian market were optimistically curious about Libra.Regardless of privacy concerns, WhatsApp and Instagram would inherently be huge factors in the local Libra ecosystem. Ho confirmed that WhatsApp, with roughly 70 million Indonesian users, is a pivotal tool for local businesses.The Hootsuite report said 90 percent of small-to-medium businesses in Indonesia identified WhatsApp as a tool for communicating with customers. Plus, the report estimated 20 percent of Indonesian internet users are on Instagram, soaring above the global average of 15 percent.Speaking to the local vision for Libra, a Facebook spokesperson told CoinDesk:“Facebook is committed to helping Indonesians come together to build communities and support businesses – both large and small – through initiatives and programs with local partners.”Image of Jakarta, Indonesian rupahs via "

The two experts expect the currency to be used for payments, commerce, applications and gaming — across Facebook’s ecosystem that includes image-based social media platform Instagram and encrypted messaging service WhatsApp. Mahaney and Schwartzman also repeated previously reported expectations that Facebook will release their currency’s white paper on June 18, following in Satoshi’s footsteps to explain the fundamental protocols that will underpin Libra, the internal codename for the project. RBC said it plans to offer an analysis of the paper when it’s released, “to help investors analyze the underlying cryptoeconomics of the token.” The currency is rumored to be a stablecoin backed by a number of global fiat currencies. It has been in development for more than six months — though the company indicated it has contemplated enveloping cryptocurrency into the social network as far back as the end of 2017 — and has 100 staff working on its development.

Wright to disclose his bitcoin addresses in an ongoing lawsuit filed ...","May 6, 2019 at 12:00 UTC",A U.S. federal court has ordered self-proclaimed bitcoin inventor Craig Wright to disclose his bitcoin addresses in an ongoing lawsuit filed against him by the estate of a former business partner.,"Wright is being sued by Ira Kleiman on behalf of the estate of his brother, the late Dave Kleiman. The Australian entrepreneur is accused of scheming to “seize Dave’s bitcoins and his rights to certain intellectual property associated with the bitcoin technology.”Kleiman, therefore, is seeking return of a good portion of 1.1 million bitcoins (worth roughly $6.19 billion as of press time) mined by the two, or its “fair market value,” as well as compensation for infringement of intellectual property.In the latest update from the case, the southern district court of Florida issued an order Friday, stating that Wright must produce a list of his bitcoin holdings as of Dec. 31, 2013. However, Wright asserted that he does not have a complete list of the addresses, according to the document.Wright further claimed that, in 2011, he transferred ownership of all his bitcoins to a blind trust.The court has now asked Wright to also provide a sworn declaration identifying the name and location of the blind trust by May 8. He must also produce a copy of any and all documents relating to the “formation, administration and operation” of the trust by May 9.The court further said:“On or before May 15, 2019, at 5:00 p.m. Eastern time, Dr. Wright shall produce all transactional records of the blind trust, including but not limited to any records reflecting the transfer of bitcoin into the blind trust in or about 2011. The production shall be accompanied by a sworn declaration of authenticity.”Last December, the court denied Wright’s attempt to dismiss the lawsuit, saying that he “converted at least 300,000 bitcoins upon Dave’s death and transferred them to various international trusts.”Craig Wright image via CoinDesk archives"

For instance, the regulator said, Powers conducted around 160 transactions of bitcoins worth about $5 million and also conducted over 200 transactions involving the physical transfer of more than $10,000 in currency, but did not file a single currency transaction report.Powers also processed several suspicious transactions without ever filing a suspicious activity report, including doing business related to the darknet marketplace Silk Road.Powers has admitted to the violations, according to the agency.FinCEN director, Kenneth A. Blanco, said that “Obligations under the BSA apply to money transmitters regardless of their size.”Blanco further said that there were indications that Powers “specifically was aware of these obligations, but willfully failed to honor them,” adding:“Such failures put our financial system and national security at risk and jeopardize the safety and well-being of our people, as well as undercut responsible innovation in the financial services space.”As a result, Powers has been fined $35,000 and is barred from providing money transmission services.Back in 2014, FinCEN ruled that bitcoin payment processors and exchanges are money services businesses under U.S. law. Last year, the regulator said that money transmitter rules apply even to those who conduct initial coin offerings or ICOs.FinCEN image via Shutterstock "
216,www.coindesk.com,"Apr 22, 2019",CFTC Chair Giancarlo Hints at What's Holding Back Bakkt's ...,https://www.coindesk.com/cftc-giancarlo-bakkt-bitcoin-futures,"Bakkt, the proposed bitcoin futures exchange, remains in regulatory limbo; 
CFTC Chairman Christopher Giancarlo wouldn't discuss specific ...","Apr 22, 2019 at 14:30 UTC",The Takeaway,"When Bakkt?The question has been posed repeatedly since last summer, when Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange, first revealed its grand vision for a bitcoin futures platform that would help take the cryptocurrency to the next level of mass acceptance. Bakkt has postponed its launch date twice now, including an indefinite delay at the end of 2018.It’s widely known that Bakkt’s holdup is regulatory in nature, rather than technical. But the specific reasons for the delay have been hazy, the subject of rumor and speculation in crypto legal circles and anonymously sourced news articles.This much is clear: Bakkt needs the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to provide a final green light before it can launch. In blog posts, Bakkt CEO Kelly Loeffler has said the exchange is working with the regulator but offered little in the way of detail. (Bakkt declined to comment for this article.)The CFTC, for its part, has kept quiet about Bakkt, so it’s hard to tell where in the process the agency is.However, CoinDesk recently sat down with CFTC Chairman J. Christopher Giancarlo, who became a hero to the crypto community after advocating for a “do no harm” approach to regulating the space before Congress in early 2018.While he wouldn’t discuss any specific proposals or companies being reviewed, Giancarlo spoke in very general terms about the regulatory issues facing new crypto products, offering insight on how the 45-year-old agency is approaching futures, as just one example.And if you read between the lines, his comments offer some clues about the snags Bakkt has hit.Describing the broad contours of U.S. derivatives regulation, Giancarlo used the language of the community which has nicknamed him “CryptoDad.”“In the world of crypto, everything’s based on certain protocols. Well the law is also a protocol, we work on a really old protocol – in our case it’s over 80 years old,” he said, referring to the Commodity Exchange Act of 1936. “It’s voluminous, it’s thousands of pages of regulations and it’s very detailed.”Under this protocol, which also includes state and federal antecedents and began to take form as far back as the 1860s, regulation of derivatives was bifurcated between the state and federal governments, Giancarlo explained.“The deal that was struck was there’d be federal oversight of the exchanges, derivatives products, certain intermediaries, and the clearinghouses but the entities that actually held custody of financial instruments, like cash, were usually regulated as banks or trusts under state law or a national charter,” Giancarlo said.These custodians, which also include commodity warehouses regulated by state-level agencies or by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, hold the underlying assets and deliver them to customers when their futures contracts expire.“Even when we have a CFTC-regulated clearinghouse, the clearinghouse uses state-regulated custodians or a nationally chartered, OCC-regulated bank for the actual holding of the funds and securities,” Giancarlo said. That said, firms can choose to hold their assets within the clearinghouses themselves.Today, Giancarlo went on, one of the challenges his agency faces comes from evaluating how futures exchanges might store cryptocurrencies. This comes into play when contracts are physically settled, meaning buyers are delivered the actual commodity at expiration.While the bitcoin futures launched in 2017 by CME Group and CBOE were settled in cash – amounting to side bets on the cryptocurrency’s dollar price – Bakkt, along with startups ErisX, Seed CX and LedgerX, aspire to list derivative contracts settled in real bitcoin.“Our statute allows us to regulate the new physically settled cryptocurrencies, but it contemplates an entity using a regulated trust or bank for custody of customer funds, unless they opt to hold the assets in the clearinghouse,” Giancarlo said.In that light, it starts to make sense why the CFTC has been slow to approve Bakkt.According to its past announcements, the exchange initially planned to custody bitcoin through its own digital “warehouse.” Since ICE is not a bank or state-regulated custodian, this would have required an exemption to the rules described by Giancarlo.However, Bloomberg reported last Thursday that Bakkt is now seeking a license from New York state (presumably for a trust company) so it can handle custody.But there’s another issue as well.Zooming out the lens again, clearinghouses act as intermediaries between buyers and sellers in derivatives markets, ensuring that both parties in a transaction uphold their respective ends of any deal. They also serve to reduce the cost and risk in such transactions, as former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke explained in a 2011 speech.But the risk isn’t totally removed – it’s mutualized among a clearing house’s member firms. Hence, if a clearinghouse were to hold bitcoin (in the sense of buying and selling it, not necessarily custodying the private keys), its members would be exposed to the asset’s rapid price swings.“A potential challenge here, and as we saw with bitcoin futures, is that the other asset class participants in the clearinghouse don’t always want the exposure to mutualize their risk on their interest rate or commodity futures with somebody else’s cryptocurrency holdings,” said Giancarlo.Indeed, a number of firms were less than thrilled by CME and Cboe launching bitcoin futures contracts at the end of 2017. One group of clearinghouses, the Futures Industry Association, even went so far as to write an open letter criticizing the CFTC for allowing this. The letter cited bitcoin’s high volatility at the time as their main cause for concern.Based on what Bakkt has shared so far, it plans to clear the one-day bitcoin futures contracts through its parent firm’s regulated clearinghouse, ICE Clear US, which would act as the intermediary.So regardless of how Bakkt custodied bitcoin, it would need to send the assets through ICE Clear US to a buyer – raising the question of how that would sit with the clearing members.CoinDesk reached out to a number of ICE Clear US members. A majority of the firms reached out to did not respond, and several more declined to comment.However, Bob Fitzsimmons, executive vice president of fixed income, currencies and commodities at ICE Clear US member Wedbush Securities, said he had no concerns about ICE warehousing bitcoin, though he did not reference its price.“Our understanding in this process is we would not be handling any of the cash bitcoin or the spot bitcoin or the spot digital currency, so there’s no need for us to have the holding or the handling of it, which is one of the things that scares people,” he said. “In terms of the futures side, we’re very comfortable.”That being said, Wedbush may be an outlier in this view – as Fitzsimmons noted, the firm has long been involved in the crypto space, having published a research report on bitcoin in 2013, and backing Coinbase early in the exchange’s life.With Bakkt in regulatory limbo, it may not be the first company to offer physically-settled bitcoin futures in the U.S.LedgerX, which was founded in 2014 and received CFTC approval to offer bitcoin derivative products in 2017, has offered swaps and options to American customers over the past two years, and now plans to offer its own physically-settled futures contracts in the coming weeks.Juthica Chou, the firm’s COO, told CoinDesk that LedgerX applied to become a Swap Execution Facility (SEF) and Derivatives Clearing Organization (DCO) when it was founded. Like Bakkt, it took some time to get regulatory approval.In 2015, the company’s applications entered an extended public comment period before receiving a final go-ahead two years later. Only then did LedgerX self-certify its physically-settled options and swaps contracts, Chou explained.Under the CFTC’s regulations, a company can self-certify that upcoming products fulfill legal and regulatory requirements, rather than ask the agency to approve a new product. CFTC staff only reviews a product to ensure that it is compliant with the appropriate regulations. If a product does violate any statute or rule, the CFTC can halt the product. Otherwise, the CFTC will allow a product to go forward.CME and Cboe both followed this process when launching its bitcoin futures products just under 18 months ago. Because Bakkt wanted to use its own warehouse to custody bitcoin, it did not follow this self-certification path.Chou noted that LedgerX holds its own bitcoin on customers’ behalf, since the company has a DCO license. In other words, it operates its own clearinghouse, and as such can conduct transactions directly with a buyer, rather than operate through an intermediary (as Bakkt would through ICE Clear). In turn, this means it can handle custody itself.“LedgerX deals directly with our participants, we have no intermediaries,” Chou said. “Ironically, the model that cuts out the intermediaries is the safest model. Too many established Wall Street firms are used to dealing exclusively with intermediaries.”Despite all the setbacks, Bakkt has continued to build up its platform, naming a board of directors, hiring execs, recruiting developers and managers, making an acquisition, and getting a $20 million to $25 million budget from its parent company (on top of $182.5 million raised from outside investors).Still and all, whether and when Bakkt launches will depend on the CFTC, and will require every last detail to match. As Giancarlo put it (again, without mentioning any specific firm or application):“It’s often a fine detail in one protocol or another that makes all the difference.”J.

At one time, a video of the tZERO homepage even showed the little-known blockchain at work.Still, if you haven’t heard of FLO before, you won’t be alone. Maybe Florincoin, the blockchain’s moniker when it first launched in 2013, shortly before the 2014 altcoin boom – will ring a bell, at least those who were in New York at the time.Joey Fiscella was a staple in the growing New York City crypto community during that area. A young, extroverted programmer, he had the ability to schmooze with the best of the business types. While the rest of the scene was focused on bitcoin, to a certain extent litecoin and for the lolz dogecoin, Fiscella was instead always talking Florincoin – a coin that’s visage bears a golden fleur-de-lis.He was a regular at the New York Bitcoin Center and was always handing out thin strips of paper with Florincoin private keys (I used to have one, but as is the nature of small scraps of paper, it has been lost).The idea was simple: Florincoin was bitcoin but with additional room for transaction comments, 140 characters at that time. And those characters would allow a decentralized social media (what else had a 140-character limit back then? Twitter), one that couldn’t be censored or stopped.It’s a dream that’s still being toyed with today – from Steemit to Peepeth to Minds – but since then Florincoin, now FLO, has moved on.Today, most of the developers and businesses involved in FLO are interested in it as an indexing tool, something that could provide the backbone of a blockchain-based Google.Not only has Medici Land Governance begun adding property records on the FLO blockchain (and partnered with the state of Wyoming, the city of Tulum in Mexico and a government official in Zambia), but tZERO is adding digital locate receipts, which locate the ownership of a stock, into FLO to mitigate naked short selling.On top of that, FLO is being utilized by the Open Index Protocol (OIP), a database for decentralized publishing of all kinds, and an app on top of OIP called Alexandria, which allows users to search and browse info in that database.The list of users goes on too.The California Institute of Technology, also called Caltech, uses FLO to store more than 17,000 records of information gathered with microscopes, and just recently announced the creation of another repository of microscope data.So how, a crypto enthusiast might ask, did FLO become a blockchain with actual users (and seemingly without gloating in the hopes of sparking a price pump)?According to Chris Chrysostom, a senior software developer at Medici Ventures, “As a developer I’m always open to looking at other solutions; people mention bitcoin a lot because right now it’s a good starting point for communicating concepts.”But, he continued:“One thing that FLO provides that bitcoin doesn’t is, right now, it has the ability to accept 1,040 bytes of metadata. FLO is able and willing to take on the blockchain bloat that many people are critical of in bitcoin.”To understand how one of the most-anticipated and regulated token projects in the space came to use a blockchain that most people don’t even know about, you have to start with its first real business case.Utilized by husband and wife team, Devon and Amy James, Florincoin became the underlying technology of the Decentralized Library of Alexandria (DLOA).A blatant nod to the ancient world library that was burned down (while it’s become a modern-day symbol for the loss of cultural knowledge, the crypto project used it as a way to illustrate the problems inherent to centralization), the project was initially touted as a decentralized library. According to Amy, the co-founder of the project, in an earlier interview, all types of content, including books, blogs, video, audio and art could be added to the blockchain and secured from censorship.DLOA was the forefather of today’s decentralized content platforms, hoping to untangle the messy distribution models that currently exist for content creators and viewers online.The project chugged along for a couple of years quietly, until Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the World Wide Web and the founder of the W3C, a standards organization for the web, was given a demo of the app.According to Amy, Berners-Lee loved it, but said: “change the name.”So the application – a Google-like search for the data, became just Alexandria and the protocol, which allows content creators to decide how their content is categorized before adding it to the FLO blockchain, became known as the Open Index Protocol (OIP).And as that change happened, the number of bytes that could be stored in a transaction was increased as well – from 140 to 528 and then to 1,040, the limit today. But what’s perhaps the most fascinating about OIP is that in a mess of new competition, the project has stuck with FLO.From Storj to Filecoin or even more broadly ethereum or EOS, there’s a slew of blockchain projects looking to tackle a similar use case – decentralized file storage – and these new players tout advanced architecture that makes their platforms faster, stronger, overall better.But Devon remains unphased by the shiny new toys.“When we started the project, our goal was to build a shared data layer that is censorship-proof, persistent and as interoperable as possible,” he told CoinDesk. “This required certain technical choices, which FLO fit perfectly – and even though other things have been launched since which do a variety of things, they don’t meet those needs better than FLO does.”For that index that OIP is, Devon contends, the project needs full global state replication (to make censorship attempts transparent), proof-of-work consensus (to make censorship attempts expensive and defensible) and the ability to directly benefit from bitcoin’s developer community (a fork of bitcoin).According to Devon, sure, OIP could instead store its index on ethereum, and with that gain a different developer community and plenty of hype.But, he said, the project would lose in other ways. For instance, after sharding is implemented, the project wouldn’t any longer get full global state replication; and after Casper – ethereum’s switch to a proof-of-stake consensus algorithm – the project wouldn’t have the security of proof-of-work.On top of that, the publishing fees would no longer be decided by the OIP working group, and would instead, entirely be a function of the gas costs – priced by the ethereum core developers – of certain operations.For many intents and purposes, FLO has become a kind of single purpose blockchain specifically for OIP. And that wasn’t a bad thing for FLO. While other institutions are starting to use FLO now, for many years Devon and Amy James were the only ones really focused on FLO and they brought in a significant number of the developers that work on the blockchain to this day.Take Sky Young, a senior full stack developer at Alexandria.io, who started working on the FLO protocol because of her role with Alexandria in August 2015.Or Jeremiah Buddenhagen, also known as bitspill, who began developing on the FLO blockchain after he completed and claimed a bounty posted by the Alexandria team to update the protocol. After that, Buddenhagen told CoinDesk, Alexandria offered him contract work until hiring him as a full stack developer in the summer of 2017.Both developers get paid to work on OIP, which many times involves the development of FLO, keeping the blockchain up-to-date, probably more so than it would be were there not a company so tied into its success.Before OIP and Alexandria, there was only FLO’s (then Florincoin’s), creator, a pseudonymous developer going by the moniker SkyAngel. It’s pretty similar to bitcoin’s Satoshi Nakamoto, although SkyAngel remains around here and there, said Fiscella.SkyAngel did not return requests for comment.In June 2013, Fiscella was trolling crypto forums looking for altcoins to mine and stumbled on FLO – hours after the software was released, he began mining the cryptocurrency and after noticing a couple of bugs (nothing consensus-related) in the code, he contacted SkyAngel within a week of its release. He’s been volunteering his time towards development ever since.And while Fiscella got his fair share of shit for messing around with FLO – this was back in the day when people thought all altcoins were useless or worse, scams – there’s a sense of pride now.“FLO is one of the oldest altcoins that is still actively traded and developed,” he told CoinDesk.And it’s done so, he continued, without a pre-mine for developers, without raising huge amounts of money in an initial coin offering (ICO), without even a million dollars from a venture capitalist. Although, the FLO developers have raised $50,000 from the community over the past six years and the OIP and Alexandria team have raised a few $100,000 here and there, which they used to continue FLO development.As such, many of the developers working on FLO right now are also pretty happy with the way it’s all turned out.For instance, Young describes FLO as “hidden” and “undervalued.” And although Buddenhagen was initially only attracted to FLO as a way to make money from small programming gigs, his “appreciation and understanding” has grown significantly over the years.He told CoinDesk, “The big idea that made me want to keep working on this project is the idea of building a public space – allowing users to determine the worth of their own work and for the consumers to determine if it’s appropriate (rather than being held to the mercy of rates decided by a private company or a vague definition of ‘advertiser friendly’).”In describing my story, meeting Fiscella years later at a crypto meetup and thinking, ‘Holy shit, Florincoin still exists,’ Buddenhagen, who’s been in the space since 2013, laughed, saying:“It’s great to see people react when they re-discover that FLO/Alexandria have not joined the ranks of shitcoin yet nor is it merely idling on but has actually grown in the shadows.”It was Chris Chrysostom, a developer that was looking to build a simple application called a bill of sale on a blockchain, that found FLO and eventually brought it into the Medici ranks.While he began the project hoping to utilize bitcoin’s OP_RETURN feature, Chrysostom quickly became frustrated with that because cumbersome to use and doesn’t hold enough data to create anything substantial. So he started looking around, reading through some content about Factom and the Storj white papers, both of which mention FLO (again Florincoin at that time).That led Chrysostom to Alexandria, where he worked alongside Devon and Amy, building out the project’s payment capabilities.Then in July 2017, he was picked up by Medici Ventures.Now a senior software developer at the venture capital subsidiary of Overstock.com, Chrysostom brought to the job his interest in FLO. Chrysostom was assigned to a project within Medici Ventures focused on property rights – the idea being a global property rights registry – and FLO and the work being done by the Open Index Protocol seemed like a natural fit there, he told CoinDesk.“We use it specifically for projects, proofs-of-concept and research for this property rights project,” he said.While Patrick Byrne, the founder and CEO of Overstock, announced a partnership in late 2017 with Peruvian economist Hernando de Soto with a similar intent, Chrysostom said his work using FLO at Medici Ventures was different, yet could easily support the De Soto project if necessary.According to Chrysostom, he was looking for a proof-of-work blockchain with similarities to bitcoin, so many similarities that the development work on bitcoin’s core team could then be applied to the other blockchain as well. For instance, security measures and scaling technologies like Segregated Witness.“FLO was really appealing – bitcoin wants its use case to be focused on value transfer (and that’s fine); FLO has taken it upon itself to have a lot of similarities to bitcoin but with the added feature of application data,” Chrysostom said. “Which is more suited for the property rights use case.”And sure enough, Chrysostom has similar things to say about the project’s ethos and morals.“It’s really appealing that FLO hasn’t gone down the path of turning itself into an ICO; it didn’t try to segregate coins in a certain way, like the staking mechanisms; it’s quite admirable that it has remained an open-source project,” he said, adding:“Four to five years have gone by, and it’s still about what its founding was all about – an open blockchain with a little extra use case. I just find it admirable that it’s stuck to that.”And as for OIP and Alexandria, those teams get Chrysostom’s praise too since, according to him, they focused on building out the software instead of hyping the coin.Chrysostom said:“FLO has been quite the stealth coin in my opinion.”While Chrysostom would, of course, love to see the developers and projects building on FLO get rewarded for their work, he understands that with investment comes responsibilities that might divert the focus away from the open index goal.For Medici Ventures part, it does not provide investment to FLO developers, Chrysostom explained, although he continued, “If the day comes that someone wants to make a pitch to Medici Ventures … I think they’d listen. They listen to all kinds of things.”Still, that’s not to say everything has run smoothly in the FLO community.For instance, toward the end of 2015, customers of Cryptsy, the only digital currency exchange that listed FLO, began having withdrawal issues, and shortly after the exchange claimed it was insolvent after a July 2014 hack.While a class action was mounted at Cryptsy in the aftermath, the parties that brought the class action against the exchange didn’t list FLO as one of the coins you could redeem. According to Fiscella, there are 11.5 million FLO coins in one Cryptsy wallet that haven’t moved since February 2014, so he suspects not that the exchange’s founders ran away with the coins (because then they probably would have sold them off at some point) but that these coins could not be recovered by any party, the exchange or even law enforcement.“It wasn’t worth anything at the time,” Fiscella said. “But FLO was once around 40 cents.”At that price, the coins lost in Cryptsy would have been worth more than $4 million.Since then Bittrex and Poloniex have also listed FLO (actually on the same day in March 2015), although Poloniex removed it shortly after the exchange was acquired by Circle. Poloniex didn’t give a reason for the delisting of FLO, though the coin was taken off the site with a handful of other altcoins.While some thought the reason was low volume, Fiscella argues that other coins that were not delisted had lower volume than FLO, so really he speculates the delisting was about FLO’s low hashrate, which meant that FLO could be relatively easily 51% attacked.This was right around the same time that Crypto 51, a website calculating the cost of 51% attacking (and then double spending) cryptocurrencies, appeared. Once that website was up, a number of cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin gold and vertcoin, began dealing with attacks.And FLO, which was on the Crypto51 list with an attack price of only $300, was exploited on Bittrex in September 2018 and 25 bitcoins were stolen. The attack works like this: an anonymous account deposited hundreds of thousands of FLO coins into Bittrex, traded that FLO for the 25 bitcoins, withdrew the 25 bitcoins and then rewrote about 480 FLO blocks. In this way, the FLO deposit was reversed and the hacker was able to reclaim the hundreds of thousands of FLO they had initially deposited and was also out with the bitcoin as well. The wallet at the exchange then didn’t have the FLO to deposit into the accounts that had bought the altcoin.When Bittrex’s system detected this, it shut down FLO trading for about a month, until the developers fixed the issue.“And by fixed it, I mean we paid 700,000 FLO to Bittrex,” Fiscella said, adding:“And by we, I mean me.”Bittrex did not respond to requests for inquiry.Joey used the FLO he had been mining since the beginning to pay back the exchange and other FLO developers set up a “Big Mac Fund” for Joey, where community members have donated about half of the 700,000 to Joey for his ongoing work on the protocol.Before the attack happened, Fiscella had been discussing the issue with Devon and Amy James, saying they needed to increase the hash rate before something like this happened. But it was too little, too late.After the attack, the developers working on the protocol decided that FLO needed to add some additional security measures to the scrypt-based mining algorithm (an alternative to bitcoin’s SHA-256 algorithm) since scrypt-based mining made it easier for an attack to take place.The developers decided to add an extra rule to the consensus algorithm, a so-called max reorg depth limit feature. This feature requires large reorganizations of the blockchain be rejected, and it’s a similar feature to that used by bitcoin cash and ravencoin.If that sounds like something that could kill a cryptocurrency, make people so skeptical of its security and value that they sell off their bags and leave it to die, it’s definitely happened before.But FLO has endured and actually, it’s developers learned from its mistakes and evolved.“The people who have joined have not asked to be paid, they’re just activists or investors,” Fiscella told CoinDesk, adding: “Everyone joined organically and they’re using their skills and network to grow the community. I think that’s really important.”Today, there are about 10 active mining pools and another 10 that sometimes mine FLO, which increases the robustness of the coin. Also in early 2018, FLO’s code was updated to Segregated Witness, a protocol change that adjusts the way data is stored, making blockchains more scalable.Echoing Fiscella’s comments about FLO being successful because of its determined developer community, Buddenhagen concluded:“They all appear to know what they’re doing and why they’re here putting in the effort whenever/wherever life/work allows the opportunity being that it’s a side project and volunteerism keeping it going, perhaps slowly at times but always moving forward with dedication and purpose.”FLO coins featured image via gunkworks.no; images in the article via Joey Fiscella"

Both his inbox and the inbox of his colleague, developer Valentine Wallace, were flooded with support requests.“We got a ton of feedback,” Wallace told CoinDesk.This bitcoin wallet is a noncustodial way – meaning users hold the keys to their assets – to send nearly instant payments worth less than roughly $1,500. The startup put a cap on transaction amounts (one-sixth of a bitcoin) while working out the kinks.For now, the app’s Autopilot setting relies on the startup’s in-house cluster with three full nodes and is mostly useful for sending bitcoin. Users can only receive as much money as they’ve sent with the app. However, more tech-savvy users are able to use a manual function for setting up their own payment channels and connecting to their own nodes.Hase said, there are plans to reduce reliance on Lightning Labs as soon as Bitcoin Core updates to the Neutrino protocol, which allows the app to tap into an external node that would otherwise be too “heavy” for a mobile device.The next step on the developers’ roadmap is enabling users to easily receive payments with a process called Lightning Loop.This app launch also kicked off the startup’s first monetization strategy: A liquidity service that utilizes Lightning Loop.Looking forward, Hase said, Lightning Labs will offer a monetized service for merchants and other power-users that frequently receive funds.“It’s non-custodial, we don’t hold their funds, but it is a paid service because it requires us to use funds for liquidity and to allow that on the backend,” he said. “I like the Amazon Web Services analogy because it allows the other startups to focus on their business logic while Amazon takes on the infrastructure.”Stepping back, the Lightning Labs team is also working closely with Jack Dorsey’s fintech startup Square. Dorsey, who is an investor in Lighting Labs, said in February that lightning-enabled features were eventually coming to Cash App. Yet, as Wallace pointed out, this app services a distinct function compared to Dorsey’s app.“It makes a lot of sense for our values as a company to have a wallet that’s totally under our control,” she said, adding the Cash App bitcoin feature is primarily a custodial conduit for purchasing bitcoin.Speaking broadly to how this new app, which admittedly has a long way to go until it can easily send and receive diverse bitcoin transaction types, plays into the startup’s long-term plan, Hase said:“Our strategy is to become an infrastructure provider that other apps and merchants can integrate.”Lightning Labs CEO Elizabeth Stark image via CoinDesk archives"

This may have something to do with McAfee’s alleged fear of SEC threats for his previous ICO support.While the underlying technologies are not new, McAfee says, “the uniqueness comes from a new approach to understanding the evolution of cryptocurrency and the mechanisms that have kept the Holy Grail of cryptocurrency – economic freedom – out of our reach.”Many commenters got right to the point.

The legislation would ban the sale, purchase, and issuance of all types of cryptocurrencies.Bank officials said that the RBI was not in communication with governmental agencies during the legislative process and had not received a copy of the bill. The bank forwarded several of Sethi’s questions to the Department for Economic Affairs as well as the Ministry of Finance — including, “What are ‘official digital currencies’ as per the RBI?” The bank has been involved in cryptocurrency legislation as recently as April when the organization unveiled a regulatory sandbox that would allow blockchain products — excluding digital currencies —  to be tested on a sample of consumers. It has not endorsed a full ban on cryptocurrencies in the past. Several governmental initiatives within the world’s second-most populous nation have been undertaken to regulate blockchain, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi first established a panel to study how to regulate the crypto sector in November 2017. The Economic Times reported that a committee in support of a total ban, including representatives of the Department of Economic Affairs (DEA), Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT), Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC), among others was “of the view that already there is a lot of delay in taking action against cryptocurrency.” If passed, those who “mine, generate, hold, sell, transfer, dispose, issue or deal in cryptocurrencies directly or indirectly” could be jailed for up to 10 years.The draft also advocates introduction of an official digital currency for India, the ‘Digital Rupee,’ that would presumably not land users in jail.Image via Shutterstock."

Players can collect and unravel clues any way they want, even selling leads if they choose. Meltzer himself donated a significant portion of the bitcoin loot, with unnamed angel investors capping it off.The game itself has no rules.“Forget about the rules, just go goddamn play,” Meltzer said, adding that so far more than 6,000 people have signed up for the game’s mailing list for key updates.Meltzer enlisted the help of zcash co-creator Ian Miers and 18 other contributors so that no single person knows the schedule or location of all the clues or keys. The logic puzzles are sprinkled across the internet and sometimes printed and pasted in the real world as well.“There are some clues that are very scavenger hunt-y, and clues where it’s purely logic puzzles or math problems,” Meltzer said, adding that the end result will numerically yield a key fragment.The first clue, released yesterday, seems to point users in the direction of the Blockstream satellite, which broadcasts data related to bitcoin.There are plans to eventually launch an app to help players keep track of clues and updates, but it will not be required to play. The app will also be a conduit for sponsorship and partnerships with external brands.“There is a company, basically so that we can pay people’s salaries,” Meltzer said. “Part of the meta game that I think people are going to like is trying to figure out who is behind this.”That being said, Meltzer is just a figurehead. There is no single person, not even a member of the tropical island–based company (which island is a secret), who knows how the game will play out.“When the winning team wins they do so by taking the bitcoin and we have nothing to do with this. We’re not giving the prize,” Meltzer said. “There are so many unknowns in this game that we kind of just want to see what happens.”One prospective player, 15-year-old German developer Malte Lauterbach, told CoinDesk games like Satoshi’s Treasure offer a teen-friendly way for his friends to learn about cryptocurrency.“Earning bitcoin through games is a pretty cool idea,” Lauterbach said, adding his parents don’t like the idea of him getting involved with speculative trading. “It’s pretty cool having diverse teams with players all over the world.”Lauterbach isn’t the only teen interested in Satoshi’s Treasure as a way to earn bitcoin without needing to own a bank account.“A lot of [players] are young, it skews very young so far,” Meltzer said. “I don’t think it will stay that way.”Lauterbach first heard about Satoshi’s Treasure through another gaming community he’s a part of. He and two teen friends from India and the U.S. are building an educational game about cryptocurrency markets on the developer tools site Repl.it, which is offering one bitcoin as the prize for the best money-themed game submission.Amjad Masad, CEO of the developer tools startup behind Repl.it, told CoinDesk:“A year ago we started noticing suspicious activity on our platform, and we found that someone built a huge mining infrastructure to mine bitcoin. We looked into it and found it was this 13-year-old kid. … There’s a huge interest in crypto from young developers.”As for Satoshi’s Treasure, Lauterbach loves the idea of collaborating with people around the world while learning more about bitcoin.Prize money merely offers an enticing twist.“Instead of something like World of Warcraft gold, I could use bitcoin to buy real stuff instead,” Lauterbach said.Buried treasure image via Shutterstock"

Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Jun 23, 2019 at 22:30 UTC","A new cryptocurrency-mining botnet has been detected exploiting Android Debug Bridge ports, a system designed to resolve app defects installed on a majority of Android phones and tablets.","The botnet malware, as reported by Trend Micro, has been detected in 21 countries and is most prevalent in South Korea.The attack takes advantage of the way open ADB ports don’t require authentication by default, and once installed is designed to spread to any system that has previously shared an SSH connection. SSH connections connect a wide range of devices – everything from mobile to Internet of Things (IoT) gadgets – meaning a lot of products are susceptible.“Being a known device means the two systems can communicate with each other without any further authentication after the initial key exchange, each system considers the other as safe,” the researchers say. “The presence of a spreading mechanism may mean that this malware can abuse the widely used process of making SSH connections.”It begins with an IP address.45[.]67[.]14[.]179 arrives through the ADB and uses the command shell to update the working directory to “/data/local/tmp,” as .tmp files often have default permission to execute commands.Once the bot determines its entered a honeypot, it uses the wget command to download the payload of three different miners, and curl if wget is not present in the infected system.The malware determines which miner is best suited to exploit the victim depending on the system’s manufacturer, architecture, processor type, and hardware.An additional command, chmod 777 a.sh, is then executed to change the permission settings of the malicious drop. Finally, the bot conceals itself from the host using another command, rm -rf a.sh*, to delete the downloaded file. This also hides the trail of where the bug originated from as it spreads to other victims.Researchers examined the invading script and determined the three potential miners that can be used in the attack – all delivered by the same URL – are:http://198[.]98[.]51[.]104:282/x86/bash
http://198[.]98[.]51[.]104:282/arm/bash
http://198[.]98[.]51[.]104:282/aarch64/bashThey also found the script enhances the host’s memory by enabling HugePages, which enables memory pages that are greater than its default size, to optimize mining output.If miners are already found using the system the botnet attempts to invalidate their URL and kill them by changing the host code.Pernicious and malicious cryptomining drops are continually evolving new ways to exploit their victims. Last summer, Trend Micro observed another ADB-exploiting that they dubbed the Satoshi Variant.Outlaw, was spotted in the past weeks spreading another Monero mining variant across China through brute-force attacks against servers. At the time researchers hadn’t determined whether the botnet had begun mining operations, but found an Android APK in the script, indicating Android devices may be targeted.Image via Shutterstock."

Research. News; Learn; Research. Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Jun 20, 2019 at 12:00 UTC",Social currency startup Roll has raised a $1.7 million seed round to help content creators monetize relationships with their fans.,"“From our perspective, the most important thing is that creators have to be in control of this economy,” Bradley Miles, one of Roll’s co-founders, told CoinDesk in an interview.Roll’s seed round was led by Arthur Hayes, the CEO of BitMEX. Other investors include Gary Vaynerchuk, Techstars Ventures, Hustle Fund and Techstars NYC.“I am really excited to work with Roll,” Hayes said in a statement. “I believe in their vision that allows influencers and artists to better monetise their contribution to the world economy using digital tokens. It is a worthy vision and a concept that will prove successful.”Vaynerchuk is a digital media and marketing entrepreneur who has also made a number of early investments in major companies, such as Snap, Twitter and Venmo. In crypto, Vaynerchuk previously invested in Coinbase.Miles described Roll as “a blockchain protocol and platform that creates social money.”Content creators – the popular term for online personalities on YouTube and other platforms – often need ways to incentivize their fans to take helpful actions. With Roll, creators could create a specific currency that carries their own brand, running on ethereum.“Social money gives them a simple way to repeatedly generate social activity,” Miles said.So, for example, a creator with a podcast could create a co-branded currency. A news show, for example, might call the currency it creates on Roll “mics.” With Roll, they would create a supply of “mics,” with a limit enforced by its smart contract, and then start creating a market with their users for earning mics and spending them.They could give users five mics if they posted about one of their episodes on Twitter. Then later they might let people join a private video chat with the hosts at a cost of 75 mics. They could also be redeemed to, for example, cut the line at a live event, get a special autograph or other unique things that a random person might not care about but a super fan would value a lot.So the tokens end up having a real value but it’s defined by the creator and the token’s market is likely to revolve around that creator.The idea is that it gives creators a way to activate their fans in a variety of ways that aren’t controlled by the platform they are sitting on. On YouTube, for example, there’s the familiar refrain to “like and subscribe,” but with a loyalty points system that the creators control, they might be able to move fans onto other platforms as well or help give them an incentive to do things in real life.“We’re excited about Roll and the potential for social money to alter the dynamics of social media as it exists today, giving much more control to creators,” Phil Toronto, VaynerX’s SVP of investing, told CoinDesk via email.Roll’s Miles said the company is looking for creators who interact heavily with their fans. They expect to see a lot of early adopters in very interactive online entertainment verticals like beauty vloggers, gaming streamers and fitness personalities.Previously, another token-based startup aimed at this same space first dramatically slowed its rollout plans before ultimately shutting down in June 2018.“We’ve seen creators over the last few years become unsatisfied over the level of control they have over the platforms,” Miles said.By using a blockchain, Roll hopes to build units of value that can exist independently of a creator’s chosen media platform.Siddharth Kalla, another co-founder of Roll, told CoinDesk:“Coming from a philosophical perspective what we are most interested in is the creator should be able to own that relationship with the fans irrespective of the platform.”Describing Roll as a product for the long tail of content creators, the company’s business model is based on this economy growing. Roll will hold a small pool of tokens minted by each creator. Down the road, Roll might work to get its tokens listed on exchanges or create its own. For now, it’s just facilitating their creation.Said Miles:“In the next decade, we see Roll serving as the social money layer that really wraps around the web.”Correction (June 20, 14:38 UTC): Gary Vaynerchuk invested personally in Roll.

As can be ...","Apr 2, 2019 at 16:18 UTC",Bitcoin’s price emerged above three major moving averages for the first time in nearly 15 months on Tuesday.,"The development is a byproduct of the cryptocurrency’s surge above $5,000 during Tuesday’s trading session, representing an increase in excess of 20 percent.A moving average (MA), when used in financial analysis, is simply a continuously calculated average of a certain economic factor like price or trading volume over a specified period of time. The moving average is particularly useful for smoothing out short-term fluctuations in the data set to identify the direction of the longer term trend. Certain moving average durations like the 50, 100 and 200 day MA’s are of more importance when analyzing the price of a traded asset because they tend to display if recent price action is out or under performing its recent or distant trends, which can highlight bullish or bearish market conditions. Perhaps most significant is the 200 day MA, which is commonly regarded as the dividing line between a strong market and weak one.Notably, bitcoin’s price is now trading above these three key moving averages in first since January 13, 2018. As can be seen in the chart above, bitcoin at the time was priced closer to $15,000 before falling below the 50 day moving average, according to Bitstamp figures. Contrary to what occurred today, this was a bearish signal that pointed to a degree of loss to the strength of the short term trend. Not long after falling below the 50 day MA, bitcoin’s price found acceptance below the remaining two moving averages, solidifying the newfound bearish trend. Recently, however, the opposite appears to be the case. Bitcoin’s price began trading above both the 50 and 100 day moving averages on Feb. 18 of this year, suggesting its trend was beginning to pick up strength. Roughly three weeks later 50 day MA crossed above the 100 day MA, which is an example of a moving average trading strategy called the bullish crossover that is generally considered a buy signal. Last but not least, bitcoin’s price was able to trade above the 200 day moving average today for the first time since it fell below the MA on March 14, 2018.Looking back at bitcoin’s historical price data, the 200 day moving average indeed appears to be an important obstacle to gain acceptance above. As can be seen, bitcoin’s price rose 7,500 percent after finding acceptance above it as well as the 50 and 100 day MAs on October 15, 2015. Notably, its price remained above the 200 day MA for the entire uptrend, until after the market had topped in early 2018. It’s important to note major moving averages are also touted for offering price support and resistance, so the 200 day MA is likely to be a stubborn technical hurdle until bitcoin’s price can close on a UTC basis above it.Disclosure: The author holds several cryptocurrencies, please see Sam’s author profile for more information. Stairs image via Shutterstock, Charts via TradingView"

In February of this year Nevada legislators introduced a suite of bills designed to promote blockchain adoption. The state’s attitudes to the emerging technology were truly cut in 2017, after the successful passage of SB398 attracted significant blockchain investment to the state.The most recent deregulatory legislation was lobbied for and supported by the Nevada Technology Association (NVTA), which worked with industry representatives to expand technology education, innovation, and investment to further diversify the state’s economy and promote high-quality jobs.In 2018, the NVTA also supported the creation of the legislative Tech Caucus, a bi-partisan group of state senators and assembly members that support smart tech policy in Nevada.Together the lobby and committee implemented the Wayfair decision for sales tax on online sales, which clarified that in using virtual currency a company does not have to follow the “marketplace facilitator” requirements. Additionally, the NVTA led the efforts to oppose SB195, which would have enacted the Uniform Law for Virtual Currency and the supplemental act, which would require licensing from the Department of Business and Industry for businesses that “engaged in certain business activity involving virtual currency.” “We’re thrilled to see that Nevada continues to take a thoughtful approach to technology,” said Jackie Morck, President of the Nevada Technology Association, in a statement. “By supporting light-touch legislation, our state is clearly committed to supporting innovation and investment.

Brad Sherman (D-Calif.) to ban cryptocurrency purchases in the U.S. is a terrible idea.,"Appearing on CoinDesk Live at Consensus 2019, Paul discussed a number of topics surrounding the cryptocurrency space, including his belief that the federal government should leave the it alone.“Detail wise, I don’t know what they’re doing yesterday or today, but I do know they’re watching,” he said. “Whether it’s gold or peanuts or silver or whatever, they will not just give cryptocurrencies a free ride.”He dismissed Sherman’s call for a ban during a Congressional hearing on May 9. “I look for colleagues to join with me in introducing a bill to outlaw cryptocurrency purchases by Americans,” Sherman said at the time.Paul called the House Financial Services Committee member “just another thug in Washington.”“They happen to believe they know what is best and they will run the show. They want to be the boss, they’re dictators, and he’s not unusual,” he said, adding:“He’s very typical in all degrees in all issues, whether it’s a social issue, like a few years ago when they decided the worst thing in the world is smoking marijuana.”“People like him are driven by power,” he said.“I think anarchy comes from the Brad Shermans of the world, because they break down the world and that’s how you have anarchy in [Venezuela], because of [too much government],” he said.He noted that one of the reasons lawmakers and regulators may be looking at cryptocurrencies in particular is due to the fact that they “challenge the status quo of the monetary system..@ronpaul is on #CoinDeskLIVE at #Consensus2019. Ron Paul. https://t.co/tGLAzxeH02— CoinDesk (@coindesk) May 13, 2019That being said, Paul indicated that the present U.S. monetary system and economy may be running on borrowed time, citing high debt levels as one example.“The system we have today is not viable, it’s out of control, the amount of debt that’s building up we might end up with the dollar but not the system,” he said, pointing to issues such as social, military and corporate welfare as reasons for this.“That is the system, and we are flat out broke, we’ve been broke for some time,” he said. “There will be liquidation, when the debt gets this big, the debt has to disappear.”Crypto may play a role in preventing this he said, adding:“I don’t know how it will evolve and I don’t know the technology but I’m enthusiastic about the alternatives and the competition and the … way it’s set up, that’s what they promised, is limitations.”That being said, the main challenge is “choice.”Individuals need to be able to develop and use alternatives, he said.Asked what sort of cryptocurrency policy he might have if he was running for president, Paul said he would advocate for what is essentially a light-touch regulatory regime, saying:“I can only speak for myself but I think it’s pretty important is not to come in and the first two to three options on cryptocurrency are ‘one’s better than another and we want to manage it,’ no, you turn it loose … you try to keep the government out of it as much as possible.”“There’s probably more regulators on the financial markets than I would have but if you didn’t have anybody punishing people who defrauded people, there’s still a lot of fraud,” he said, though he noted that regulations haven’t prevented fraud either.Ideally, he’d like to decentralize regulatory authority, so that agencies based in Washington, D.C. or New York City don’t control the rest of the nation’s startups and businesses.“Government should be so small that nobody has a financial advantage to being there,” he said.Ron Paul, Pete Rizzo image by John Biggs for CoinDesk"

Last year, the NYPD received only three similar complaints with direct mention of bitcoin.Victims are usually told by impersonators that their Social Security number is involved in illegal activity like drug trafficking or money laundering and that to protect their money or to avoid being arrested victims must send money in bitcoin to a certain address.Scammers use a technology called “spoofing” to manipulate caller IDs to display phone numbers of the Social Security Administration and other official agencies. Sometimes, they also use the names of real officers, the NYPD said.NYPD chief of community affairs, Nilda Hofmann, said:“Sophisticated phone scams use the trust victims have in their own governmental and law enforcement agencies against them. Victims of this type of phone scam are not limited to senior citizens—these criminals are targeting every strata of society and every demographic is vulnerable.”The department noted that it will never call individuals to ask for money or information over the phone.Last month, the Berkeley Police Department also issued a similar warning, saying that scammers masked their own telephone numbers with official numbers on users’ caller id and demand payments.NYPD police car image via Shutterstock "

All despite recent upgrades to stabilize its value through a fee increase.Meanwhile, as seen above, the reaction to the Bitfinex and tether allegations has been negative with the majority of cryptocurrencies flashing red today.Bitcoin has since recovered slightly and is changing hands at $5,138 after dropping to a low of $4,953 on the Coinbase exchange late Thursday.And Whale Alert, a Twitter service that monitors blockchain transactions, notified that hours after the news, 3,999 bitcoin, which was worth $20 million, got moved out from Bitfinex’s exchange wallets to unknown addresses.Such recent moves are indicative of trader’s sentiment who are currently seeking to reduce their risk by transferring funds away from the allegedly troubled exchange.However, others have fared better than some with the majority of stablecoins seeing upside action as investors shift their preference away from Tether to other viable options such as Circle’s USDC or Gemini’s GUSD.Ether is today’s worst performing asset amongst the top 3 major networks, down 6.91 percent and is struggling to find a strong bid beyond $152 after falling from $165 at 21:00 UTC yesterday.Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency at the time of writing.Untethered image via Shutterstock; charts via TradingView"

Not as they wish it to be. This is especially true when putting investment dollars at risk. One needs to ask questions to understand elements influencing the outcome of an investment.One of those questions is: How could things go wrong here?Investment guru Charlie Munger, for example, says: “Invert, always invert: Turn a situation or problem upside down. Look at it backward. What happens if all our plans go wrong? Where don’t we want to go, and how do you get there?”There is potential for catastrophic, systemic risk in crypto right now. Recent events surrounding Binance, Bitfinex and the stablecoin Tether necessitate this conversation.Yet it is strange how infrequently one hears the concept of systemic risk mentioned in this space.The New York Attorney General continues to demand more information from Bitfinex and Tether. The NYAG indicates that there are numerous inconsistencies with Bitfinex/Tether’s statements.This makes them want to “understand what has taken place, and what continues to take place, at these companies.” Even so, a judge has narrowed the scope of information that Bitfinex/Tether need to provide.The prices of “stablecoins” have fluctuated since the NYAG started making noise in April.
Source: TokenAnalystNow, if we read ever so slightly between the lines, there seems to be a suggestion that there may be further improprieties. Or at least the NYAG is reasonably certain it is worthwhile to investigate this further. They’ve already stated that they believe there may be fraud involved.So, it makes sense that they want to find out the extent of it and whether other illegal activities have happened or continue to happen.If this indeed turns out to be the case, enforcement action could be taken by the government against Tether. If such action prevents USDT from being freely traded, holders of tether would then almost certainly sustain significant losses.But that’s only part of the picture. Binance has decided to suspend deposits and withdrawals for a week after a $40 million hack. Suspension of funding flows is never a good thing, especially since Binance’s public USDT wallet has been drained of hundreds of millions of dollars without explanation.Remarkably, USDT is still the most widely used stablecoin. Traders use it extensively to move into and out of positions on crypto exchanges across the globe.However, it’s possible USDT could get locked up or otherwise become unusable. There would likely be a cascade of activity following that. This could cause massive, ecosystem-wide harm to the entire crypto space.Many exchanges (including Binance nd Bitfinex) likely couldn’t function. Assets would likely get locked up in court battles that could take years to resolve. Think Lehman Brothers.When they fell, the rest of Wall Street felt the pain.A long decline (and market hope) for Lehman resulted in catastrophe for the market. SourceAs an interesting side note, it is possible that large traders or other holders decide to sell off USDT. This would be in favor of a coin that is perceived to be safer, like BTC. This could happen with a lot of volume. It could drive up the price of BTC short-term as people exit USDT positions and park funds in BTC.It may be tempting to look at BTC’s recent price increase as a positive sign. Yet it is worthwhile to consider whether it may be due to people dumping tether positions and rolling them into BTC to some extent.Despite bad news, the BTC price keeps going up.Source: TradingviewRegulators could immediately take significant action against Bitfinex/Tether. It could have a cascading effect whereby exchanges simply blow up. To borrow a phrase from Bitmex’s Arthur Hayes, altcoins could get “molly-whopped.”If the government finds conclusive evidence of fraud committed by Tether or Bitfinex, then it stands to reason that decisive action would be taken as a result. The fallout from such a scenario would likely envelop the whole crypto space.Preparing for a potential crypto collapse may be a prudent and rational move. Those with large allocations to digital assets should think carefully. Imagine a large exchange locking up. Or traders panicking from the biggest stablecoin imploding or getting seized by authorities.Do you think crypto investments will be safe then? What exactly will happen to them if everyone is trying to head for the exits?“Affairs are easier of entrance than of exit; and it is but common prudence to see our way out before we venture in.”When the Greek storyteller Aesop said this around the 6th century BC, it is highly unlikely that he was envisioning the digital asset ecosystem. And yet this quote contains untold amounts of wisdom. Much of which applies directly to crypto and digital asset investing.While we do actually hope we are wrong here, we also feel it’s better to err on the side of safety. If there is a systemic shock to the crypto space, it is likely that many investments will suffer. Both liquid crypto assets, and illiquid ones.If the shock is sufficiently bad, it would be reasonable to expect a repricing of assets that could take valuations back to 2016 or 2015 levels.Think about how you would exit a building if there were hundreds or thousands of people trying to exit through the same door as you. Before you walk into that building, you had better have an exit plan (or two) in place.Don’t believe us?

sending out legal letters to those community members that have ...","Apr 16, 2019 at 19:45 UTC",There’s a legal conflict brewing between outspoken members of the bitcoin community and the controversial computer scientist who claims to be the cryptocurrency’s creator.,"It’s a complex story to untangle, but it boils down to Australian computer scientist Craig S. Wright – who has claimed to be bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator since 2016 – sending out legal letters to those community members that have called him a “fraud.”While several news reports, as early as late 2015, identified Wright as Satoshi, and the lead maintainer of bitcoin at the time Gavin Andresen even lent his credence to the unmasking, security experts rebuked the claim, leaving many in the cryptocurrency community unconvinced. Yet, Wright has continued stating that he is Satoshi and those that believe that to be a false claim have continued to call Wright a liar.The latest mudslinging came after “Hodlonaut,” the pseudonymous bitcoin user that created the lightning torch experiment, which promoted bitcoin’s layer-two scaling tech for payments, used his newfound influence to castigate Wright earlier this month.Sometime after the public tweets, Wright sent a letter to Hodlonaut arguing that those calling him a “fraud” are libelous and damaging his reputation – warranting legal action.Yet, the legal threat against Hodlonaut hasn’t worked the way Wright probably wanted – with users worried about expensive and timely court cases and so hesitant to post negatively about him.Instead, though, the threat triggered a wave of community support for Hodlonaut, with many others jumping in to call Wright a fraud.Bitcoin podcaster Peter McCormack also pointed fingers at Wright and received a legal letter, asking him to apologize publicly and delete any incendiary tweets or face legal repercussions. On Sunday, McCormack published a three-page, tongue-in-cheek response saying that he would not apologize, would fight Wright in court and again arguing that Wright “is definitely not the person behind the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto.”To lend support to his argument, McCormack argued anyone can claim to be Satoshi.“‘Hey, I Peter McCormack am Satoshi Nakamoto. I created Bitcoin,’ See, I just did it,” McCormack wrote.A legal letter was also sent to Adam Back, CEO of Blockstream, according to a tweet by the firm’s CSO, Samson Mow.What’s more, exchanges in the ecosystem seem to be lining up in support of Hodlonaut as well. Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) also called Wright a “fraud,” and soon after, announced the exchange would delist bitcoin SV (Satoshi’s vision), the cryptocurrency that Wright supports and which broke off from bitcoin cash late last year after yet another feud involving Wright.Exchange service provider Shapeshift is planning to do the same, and Kraken launched a Twitter poll Monday seeking input on a possible delisting.Wright first came to fame in December 2015, when publications Gizmodo and Wired published investigative articles detailing how he might be the force behind bitcoin’s creation (in the case of Gizmodo, the late Dave Kleiman was identified as a possible collaborator). Those articles were, at the time, the latest effort by the media to identify Satoshi Nakamoto, who disappeared from the scene in late 2010.Months later, a series of new articles – published by the BBC, GQ and the Economist – profiled Wright and his efforts to prove that he was, in fact, the creator of bitcoin. Wright also published a blog post that notably featured a digital signature tied to the ninth bitcoin block.Yet this effort was rebuffed by a wave of security and cryptography experts, and Wright was labeled a fraud by many in the bitcoin community.More recently, Wright became involved in the development of bitcoin cash, which was forked away from the main bitcoin blockchain in 2017. Yet subsequent arguments over changes to bitcoin cash’s code led to plans for bitcoin SV (or Satoshi’s Vision), setting the stage for last fall’s fork.Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin called him a fraud publicly at a conference last year.More recently, Wright has issued legal threats to developers of bitcoin cash.Wright and businessman Calvin Ayre, who has been working with Wright on bitcoin SV, have sent legal letters to a handful of people, including ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin and cryptocurrency blog Chepicap, for alleged defamation.Thus far, McCormack is the only recipient to reveal the contents of his letter to the public. The letter was issued in response to a series of tweets from McCormack that criticized Wright, including one calling him a “fraud” and another calling him a “sociopath.”The letter from the law firm SCA Ontier to McCormack states: “You have … carried out a target campaign on Twitter to harass and libel our client by posting highly defamatory and abusive tweets, knowing they would be read not just by your 52,000 followers, but also by our client.”It continues:“The above publications have caused serious harm to our client’s reputation in this jurisdiction and continue [sic] to do so.”The letter goes on to ask McCormack to delete the tweets deemed defamatory and to issue an apology to Wright.Much of the public outcry against the brewing legal spat has taken place on Twitter, with the contours of the fight being sketched out by supporters of people like Hodlonaut and McCormack and those who are defending Wright and bitcoin SV generally.A key sign of the battle-lines: a wave of bitcoin enthusiasts have changed their  Twitter profile photos to Hodlonaut’s picture, which features a grey cat in an astronaut suit.Going further, some supporters have set up and crowdsourced a legal fund for him, dubbed We Are All Hodlonaut, which raised $20,000 in under 24 hours. As of the time of writing, the fund has amassed in excess of that original goal $28,000 from more than 1,000 supporters, and according to Lightning Labs CEO Elizabeth Stark, most of the contributions came from lightning payments.What’s more, Preston Byrne, an influential lawyer in the cryptocurrency space, tweeted that he is “assisting Hodlonaut pro bono.”Essentially, no. Despite the legal letters, influential people in the community continue to tweet negatively about him and the Nakamoto claim.For instance, developer Jonathan Toomin tweeted in parody:“I am God. If anyone publicly refutes this assertion, I will sue you for defamation. You will then need to prove in court that I am not God, which you will be unable to do.”Chaincode bitcoin developer Matt Corallo stepped in on Twitter to say: “Dunno how British libel suits work,” but if it helps, he offered to fly to the UK to provide “expert witness” and to state “unequivocally, under oath, that Craig is a fraud.”At the same time, others in the space want all the drama to die down, arguing that Wright should be ignored.As Bitcoin Core maintainer Jonas Schnelli tweeted:“He seeks attention with insane methods. Ignore. Ignore. Ignore his lawsuit. Don’t make him feel important. He is a psychopath.”Hodlonaut profile picture via Twitter (Created by CryptoScamHub)"

Ltd., each of which is presented as its own bankrupt firm.As a result, each entity has its own list of assets and liabilities, even though they overlap. As of April 12:“There is a material discrepancy between the reported fiat and cryptocurrency obligations” due to the fact that there were different estates, creditors and known assets, wrote George Kinsman, the EY employee acting as the monitor and trustee.Kinsman also cited shoddy bookkeeping as an issue EY faced when pulling together these numbers.Stepping back, Quadriga entered a civil rehabilitation process at the end of January, when Jennifer Robertson, the widow of Quadriga founder Gerald Cotten, wrote in an affidavit that the exchange was unable to access its cold, or offline, crypto wallets following his death.EY was unable to locate any cryptocurrencies in the cold wallet addresses listed by Quadriga, however, aside from 103 bitcoin accidentally transferred from a hot wallet.Addressing EY’s efforts to locate Quadriga’s missing funds in this week’s report, Kinsman wrote:“A complete and fulsome review of Quadriga’s financial affairs will take considerable time and effort to pursue and may not be possible or cost effective to complete given the lack of available information, the volume of transactions processed and the number of [third-party payment processors] and crypto currency exchanges involved, many of whom to date, have not fully cooperated with the Monitor’s investigation.”EY also holds about $500,000 in cryptocurrency recovered from Quadriga’s hot, or online, wallets “and various other sources.” Broken down, EY holds 61 bitcoin, 33 bitcoin cash, 2,661 bitcoin gold, 851 litecoin and 960 ether. The report did not address what progress, if any, EY has made in locating the exchange’s other missing cryptos.While Robertson initially estimated that the exchange may have as many as 115,000 creditors, Kinsman wrote in the new report that Miller Thomson, the court-appointed representative counsel for the exchange’s users, had presented an omnibus proof of claim for 76,319.Miller Thomson also presented the $214,618,928 CAD figure that is being used to calculate liabilities.In addition to Quadriga’s users, Robertson is listed as a secured creditor, and is owed $300,000 CAD ($223,500 USD) based on her costs in starting the civil rehabilitation process, though Kinsman said he expects this claim to be challenged.Costodian, a payment processor for Quadriga, has also claimed $774,214 CAD ($577,200) in processing fees, though this claim has yet to be resolved in court.Kinsman also addressed the estate of Cotten and Robertson. In a previous report, he noted that it appeared corporate funds may have been used to purchase personal goods, and EY agreed to an asset preservation order with Robertson’s attorneys to prevent the liquidation of any assets.In this week’s report, Kinsman noted that while the order is in effect, “for the purpose of the Quadriga Statement of Affairs the Quadriga Estate has valued this possible asset category at $1,” a placeholder figure that indicates the exchange may have more than just the $21 million in assets that were already listed.While the assets in the estate have not been appraised, “the preserving parties” have told Kinsman that they approximate $12 million CAD (about $9 million USD), meaning they still would be insufficient to fill the hole Quadriga finds itself in.Nova Scotia Supreme Court image by Nikhilesh De for CoinDesk"

The twist is that instead of paper cards, it uses non-fungible tokens (NFTs), or digital collectibles similar to CryptoKitties, to confer ownership of an asset.Unlike most digital games, however, properties that are recorded on the blockchain throughout the gameplay will be truly owned by the players, not the gaming company, Uplandme says. And just like in real life, land in this virtual realm has a fixed supply. “We expect that the game momentum will be driven by the simple fact that there is a natural scarcity of available properties because they are based on real-world addresses,” said Uplandme co-founder Dirk Lueth.Lueth and his partners, Mani Honigstein and Idan Zuckerman, aim to disrupt the $50 billion market for casual (mass market) games.“One game night, while playing Monopoly and watching the Netflix series ‘Stranger Things’ we got thinking about a property game in a parallel universe and realized how properties that are based on real-world addresses can be the perfect collectible NFT,” Lueth told CoinDesk.Angel investors in the seed round include Kai Bolik, co-founder and CEO of Gameduell, a gaming community with more than 70 games and 130 million players worldwide; Jan Sprengnetter, CEO of Sprengnetter Group, a property valuation provider; and Markus Ogurek, a former vice president of Hewlett Packard Enterprise.The lead investor, FinLab EOS VC Fund, is backed by Block.one, the company that built the EOS blockchain, and FinLab AG, which focuses on investing in German financial technology companies. “We invested into Uplandme, Inc. because we like the genuine idea of a virtual property market powered by the EOS Blockchain and the very experienced and passionate team behind it,” said Stefan Schuetze, managing director of FinLab EOS VC Fund.To be sure, Upland is one among many blockchain-based games in various stages of development.Upland players will be able to trade their properties on a marketplace for an in-game currency called UPX. Beta testers are currently able to trade properties in a virtual San Francisco.Monopoly board image via Shutterstock"

The digital currency proposal is yet to comply with regulatory standards, which is the main concern among regulators at an international scale.“There are a lot of regulatory issues that need to be addressed and they’ve got to make sure there’s a solid business case,” Lowe said.The social media platform announcement has already sparked a chain of reactions this week, with distrust being commonplace from regulators and developers alike.The RBA’s Chief extended his reticence to the use of cryptocurrencies in general, arguing that cryptocurrencies “would not take off” in Australia since the population is already used to digital payments controlled by banks.“We already have a very, very efficient electronic payments system that allows anyone of us to make bank payments to another person in five seconds just knowing their mobile phone number,” Lowe said.On the same note, the RBA also published its views on the future of cryptocurrencies in Australia. Unsurprisingly, its conclusions are not very far from its main representative opinions.According to the institution, centralized digital payment methods leave no room for massive adoption of cryptocurrencies, stating that the use of this form of money requires a control that many are against.“Many projects generally come at the cost of making a cryptocurrency more centralized, a feature that may not be attractive to crypto-libertarians and in any case makes them more similar to established payment systems,” the RBA said.Australian flag image via Shutterstock"

Findex also believes that 1 billion of these have mobile phones and 500 million have internet access.However, Findex also says that over half of the 1.7 billion come from just seven countries: Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Nigeria and Pakistan.More than half of these are in places where:Targeting these unbanked just doesn’t seem plausible. How are they going to get in and get people to use it? Who and how many people are realistically going to join?

None are based in Africa or Asia where most of the world’s unbanked actually are.Libra expects to have 100 members by 2020. Perhaps some of them will be in places, with networks, and local ground presence and knowledge, to actually roll it out. Then again, the Breakthrough Initiative, a founding member with Zuckerberg on the board, says its main mission is searching for alien life, so Libra already has outer space covered I guess…Stable currency plans also need further explanation.The countries left where it can access the unbanked sometimes have significant currency swings. The proposal is to make Libra very stable by backing it with a basket of yet undecided fiat currencies hoped to have “low volatility.”OK.Well, the definition of volatility and its adjunct risk is tied to the asset/liability profile of the user. In any economy it’s a better idea that your earnings and debts should be in same currency. There are numerous cases of developing economies taking on debt in or relying on foreign currencies and it ending in disaster.Never mind developing economies, just look at southern Europe and the northern dominated euro. Libra risks inflicting this sort of mess on the people it wants to help and who need this problem even less than comparably richer Europeans.It doesn’t work for countries to rely on foreign currencies. For individuals or small businesses with wages and expenses in local fiat…this looks suicidal.Libra may have good intentions. It needs to answer why this isn’t just a rich country solution being pushed on poor country problems. It’s like when well-meaning philanthropists donate solar panels without engineers to maintain them, or livestock which are ill-suited to the local climate, or irrigation pumps where there is no power grid.The stakes are obviously much higher if a new currency is implemented and it goes wrong.Facebook also have some questions to answer about China.China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is sprawling. China has signed cooperation documents with 126 countries and 29 international organizations, many in the places where Facebook might hope to service.Many large projects are already underway with Chinese cooperation. Ports, railways, highways, power stations, aviation, telecommunications and finance. It seems very unlikely that China wouldn’t also want to target the unbanked in these countries and extend its technological and financial influence.Is Facebook prepared to go up against China? That’s after it’s done looking domestically at anti-trust monopoly cases, objections from regulators, the Federal Reserve and Congress, and internationally at places like the Bank of England or the French Finance Ministry.On the other hand, China has long been a big center for bitcoin miners, cryptocurrency trade and was a major centre of the ICO craze in 2017.It seems highly unlikely that similar-profile Chinese companies to Facebook have not already considered this idea and run some numbers. They are reportedly not following Facebook any time soon.Has someone like Jack Ma figured it’s perfectly fine selling things to unbanked Chinese in the existing way? Is a new system and having to educate people on a new cryptocurrency not worth the hassle? For now, big Chinese technology companies seem happy to stick with conventional payment networks, don’t want a blockchain solution, and don’t want to try a battle with the Chinese treasury.And that brings things to the final thought.Facebook got big by giving away free social media and selling targeted advertising mostly in G7 countries.This works when the targets have money to buy things. What is targeting the subset of 1.7 billion unbanked actually worth? What do they buy that is worth advertising? How is Libra actually intending to make any money?What is the point of Libra? Skeptics and general grumpies might say it’s one of these:This piece truly isn’t about making any judgement on any of the guesses above or any other plans for Libra. Not much has really been announced and it’s too early to assess.However, a dispassionate, fact-based and common-sense analysis shows Libra is likely not anything to do with servicing the 1.7 billion poor and unbanked in developing countries.Maybe the unbanked are a lot richer than we realize or will be soon. Maybe Libra has made more progress than we realize in getting the right governmental permission to access crypto-hostile and generally difficult countries. At the moment this just looks either poorly planned or there are other, smarter things to come. It just isn’t credible that this is about servicing the unbanked.Zuck, if you want help, I have some ideas. You can find me on Facebook.Zuckerberg image via Shutterstock"

This stable coin is similar to Facebook’s Libra, and aims to promote uniformity and reliability among a fractured landscape of digital assets.“I’m really excited about doing this,” Moore told the business media outlet. “I hope it makes me rich.”Moore said he will officially join Decentral on July 1, as chief economic officer and report to Sam Kazemian, Decentral CEO. “These guys are super smart,” he said of his partners.He also told Fox, he believes cryptocurrencies can circulate in the economy in such a way that they don’t conflict with the Fed’s monetary policy, adding, “This is an alternative way of making payments.”Kazemian told Fox that Decentral isn’t trying to compete with the Fed, but plans to introduce their business model to Fed officials at some point.“Decentral will solve the biggest problem facing regulators when it comes to the crypto space: The current instability of pricing,” he said.“Our goal is to be collaborative, not combative,” he said. “The next big wave in the crypto space is a digital currency that is designed to be useful to consumers and keep stable prices instead of acting as volatile, speculative investments. Stable coins are the next big innovation in the crypto industry.”It’s unclear how Decentral will convince holders to trade their crypto for this new token, or how the firm will act to prevent inflation – a core mandate of Fed – if the business does not have authority to act as a central clearinghouse.Kedar Iyer will serve as chief technology officer, Travis Moore as director of software, and Henry Liu as chief operating officer —all of whom have backgrounds in crypto and technology startups. The remaining three partners have political backgrounds.Mike Novogratz is cited as an investor in Decentral’s parent company.Moore previously worked as an editorial writer for the Wall Street Journal, and was a member of the conservative Heritage Foundation. He is also a distinguished visiting fellow to the White House, following his advisement on President Trump’s 2017 tax plan.Moore was picked by Trump in March to fill one of two vacant positions at the Fed, but had not been formally nominated. He withdrew his bid in early May after weeks of criticism about his political partisanship, shifting views on interest rate policy, and sexist comments about women.His discussions with Decentral began at recent SALT conference, a hedge fund and investing confab in early May run by Anthony Scaramucci of SkyBridge Capital.Federal Reserve seal via Shutterstock"

Turkey’s growth as a leading bitcoin market is supported by other data as well.“Turkey is without a doubt the only country that boasts of a high percentage of independent crypto-ownership in Europe and the Middle East,” Cheung said. “It has one of the most robust and promising crypto communities anywhere in the entire world.”The lira accounts for 6 percent of crypto-fiat liquidity in 2019, CoinMarketCap data shows, retaining its 2018 rank as the fifth most popular fiat-to-crypto pair worldwide. According to BtcTurk CEO Ozgur Guneri, inflation is slowly, yet consistently, driving Turkish demand for bitcoin.Guneri told CoinDesk his crypto exchange has also on-boarded more than 30,000 new users so far in 2019.Those sign-ups speak to the relatively high crypto adoption rates in Turkey. A survey conducted in April 2018 by the media arm of ING Bank found that Turkey already had the highest percentage of bitcoin holders in Europe, with 18 percent of Turkish respondents saying they own cryptocurrency. (Globally, Turkey had the highest rate of respondents who expected to hodl long-term, at 45 percent, compared to 21 percent of crypto owners in the United States.)“We have never seen a declining number of users, just the pace of growth might go down a little bit. Even on the most bloody day, we’re signing up new users,” Guneri said, adding that BtcTurk’s retail arm has already seen several days in April with $14 million worth of volume.While these numbers may seem small compared to US unicorns like Coinbase, Turkish traders have garnered growing influence in the global marketplace.Fluctuating inflation has been a primary driver of crypto adoption among Turkish traders, Guneri said. For example, when the lira dropped roughly 20 percent against the dollar in a single day in August 2018, BtcTurk’s trading volume jumped more than 100 percent.“The U.S. dollar and the euro, in my opinion, are not hard money anymore but bitcoin is,” Guneri said. “Bitcoin is the new generation’s store of value, and sometimes a way of speculating, of course.”Meanwhile, Guneri’s Istanbul-based exchange launched institutional services for foreign investors for the first time earlier this month, BtcTurk Pro, in order to capitalize on crypto-to-fiat arbitrage opportunities.Guneri told CoinDesk:“The volatility of the Turkish lira is quite high and couple that with the price of bitcoin … and we have a market that is illiquid enough that sometimes there are inefficiencies that you can benefit from. Yet we are liquid enough for institutional investors to operate.”Due to Turkish exchanges’ strict listing and on-boarding policies mandated by relationships with local banks, many traders acquire their first bitcoin domestically then send the digital loot to global exchanges with a wider range of trading pairs and fiat liquidity options.“Some users can increase their investments in bitcoin during the volatile periods of the Turkish lira,” Turkish vlogger Alp Işık told CoinDesk. “Turkish users generally use local exchanges as a gateway to foreign exchanges.”All things considered, Işık and Guneri both see crypto adoption continuing on a steady upward slope, correlated with volatility for both the lira and bitcoin.Referring to competition among exchange platforms around the world, BtcTurk’s Guneri said:“There is definitely a global space for [crypto-to-crypto], but I think there will be a consolidation in terms of real volume. … There will be significant value in local markets and local knowledge.”Istanbul image via Shutterstock"

on average, active funds have underperformed bitcoin so far this year.","May 25, 2019 at 09:40 UTC",Noelle Acheson is a veteran of company analysis and a member of CoinDesk’s product team. The opinions expressed in this article are the author’s own.,"The following article originally appeared in Institutional Crypto by CoinDesk, a free newsletter for institutional investors interested in cryptoassets, with news and views on crypto infrastructure delivered every Tuesday. Sign up here.It’s not easy being a crypto fund manager. As well as unruly markets and elusive valuations, there’s the increasing competition and pressure on fees. And performance has been lackluster: Vision Hill’s Q1 report showed that, on average, active funds have underperformed bitcoin so far this year.The bear market of 2018 triggered the closure of many crypto funds, and a report released last week by PwC and Elwood Asset Management showed that there are far fewer active funds in existence than we had been led to believe.The report also pointed out that, given a median management fee of 2% and a median fund size of $4 million, operational sustainability is tough: $80,000 recurring income is not enough to cover salaries and other overheads, especially given the likelihood of increasing compliance requirements.The PwC/Elwood report mentions some steps that funds are taking to boost recurring income, such as market making and advisory roles.It overlooks one potentially significant source of revenue, however: crypto lending. Funds could lend out the assets they hold, for a fee.Given the growing demand for crypto lending services, this potential income stream could be enough to give a number of funds a greater chance of survival, as well as inject liquidity and diversity into the sector.It could also, however, add hidden risk to the market overall.Before we look in more detail at this risk, let’s examine the trend toward lower fees.According to the PwC/Elwood report, the median (mid-point) fee is 2%. This is in line with typical fees for “traditional” hedge funds. But there are signs that they are coming down. The report states that the average crypto fund fee is 1.72%, which means that many charge significantly less. This is also in line with the traditional sector, where fee pressure is already becoming the subject of headlines.The pressure is even more acute in mutual and index funds, where fees are moving to zero or even lower. Last year, investment management giant Fidelity offered a mutual fund with no management charge. And earlier this month, the SEC greenlighted a fund from asset manager Salt Financial that promised negative fees.Meanwhile, demand for crypto lending is growing at an astonishing pace, as the inflow of funds into lending startups and the demand from institutions shows. While there is no concrete data on the extent to which crypto funds lend out their assets, there are signs that this practice is spreading.This has potential implications for the entire sector, both good and bad.On the positive side, increased lending of crypto assets could increase velocity and, by extension, price discovery as a greater number of transactions makes it easier for a market to express its views.Furthermore, a growing demand for short selling, facilitated by asset lending, will to some extent enhance liquidity and help to develop a pool of natural buyers – all short sales have to be unwound eventually. This develops a “soft” floor for an asset price.But “more liquid” does not necessarily mean “liquid,” and here is where the risk of market manipulation could seep in.Let’s say I manage a crypto fund that has invested in altcoin A, and let’s say that I lend out part of my stake to counterparty A. In traditional finance, most securities loans can be recalled at any time – let’s assume that I can do the same here. I recall the loan of altcoin A, and counterparty A has to scramble to get it back to me. Whether counterparty A used the loan to sell short or lent it on to counterparty B, it will now have to buy the asset back in the market, probably pushing up the price by doing so.Now, what if I knew that would happen, and used the recall as part of a strategy to boost my fund valuation? True, I probably couldn’t lock in the profit by selling altcoin A without pushing the market back down, but it could serve to fix a higher value on a certain date, which would boost my reported performance, which in turn could encourage more investment in my fund.Plus, there’s the added benefit of knowing that the short sellers got squeezed, and the glory of my outperformance compared to those with a more negative outlook.Obviously, if I got a reputation for doing this, no-one would borrow from me. And the drying up of that revenue stream could mean that I may end up having to liquidate my fund – just imagine what my dumping all of my altcoin holdings on the market (after recalling all loans) would do to other funds’ valuations.One solution could be for investors to insist that the funds they back do not engage in this type of lending activity. But, given the difficulty of covering costs with declining management fees, that could make it less likely that compliant funds survive. And if the returns from lending boost fund performance, am I not obliged to seek the best possible return for my investors? Most investors in crypto hedge funds are themselves institutions, who are also judged by their performance. There is for now little incentive to insist on curbs on lending.Regulation could come in and establish rules over transparency and oversight, as is happening in traditional finance. But regulators are still getting their heads around the crypto space, and are doing so at a cautious pace.In the absence of clear rules, it is up to the sector to keep an eye on developments in both crypto fund administration and crypto asset lending. It is, after all, in its own interest to ensure a smooth and robust market.But self-regulation has its own risks and is hard to execute in as opaque an activity as crypto asset lending. True, blockchain-based transactions are available for all to see – but most crypto asset lending is likely to take place off-chain, as an agreement between two parties.However, letting the practice spread without some guidance could escalate systemic risk. As the traditional markets saw in 2008, the intertwined web of asset holdings through through opaque lending arrangements left institutions vulnerable and investors grasping at air.Crypto markets have enough hurdles to overcome to reach mainstream acceptance. We shouldn’t let hidden risks that develop in front of our very noses to be one of them.Lending image via Shutterstock"

Currently integrated with Telegram, the company tells CoinDesk it has 100,000 users with 2,000 actively using the product.“For mass-market adoption of decentralized banking, you need more people,” said Button Wallet COO Rachael McCrary. “You need to make it easier for people to buy in.”To that end, the company’s new fiat-to-crypto functionality comes as some of the world’s most prominent messaging platforms explore crypto use cases. Facebook’s “GlobalCoin” project is said to center on payments in the social media giant’s Messenger and WhatsApp services. Telegram itself is reportedly nearing completion of its hotly anticipated Telegram Open Network (TON).Button Wallet’s fiat on-ramp stems from a partnership with payment processor Wyre. Jack Jia, Wyre’s director of institutional sales, told CoinDesk via email:“At Wyre, we’re on a mission to help lower the barriers to entry for crypto platforms by offering them compliant ports into a regulated fiat world. … Helping users already familiar with Telegram to easily buy crypto and self-custody funds all within the messenger app is a major achievement by Button Wallet.”Button Wallet is non-custodial wallet that lets users exchange and send a variety of cryptocurrencies, typically in small amounts. The startup was funded last fall with a $470,000 pre-seed round from MIT Play Labs, Ethereum Classic Labs, Seraph Group and angel investors.McCrary says the company has seen a concentration of users in the U.S., U.K., Indonesia, Venezuela and Germany. Initially, only U.S. dollars sent via automated clearing house (ACH) transfer will be supported for purchases. The company says it plans to add fiat currencies from Europe and Asia soon. Bitcoin, ether and DAI are the only cryptos available for purchase with dollars, though the wallet can store several other assets.Next up, Button Wallet says it’s ready to integrate Telegram’s forthcoming GRAM token. There are also plans to plug into other messaging platforms. At the recent ETH New York hackathon, Button Wallet co-founder Alekasndr Safonov said the company built a wallet that works in Discord.“We definitely believe in empowering people to control their own finances in any way they want,” McCrary said, adding:“We’re just a software company giving people another option.”Button Wallet team photo courtesy of the company"

The study further found that the majority (around 60 percent) of these whales are not active traders, meaning they are holding their assets and are not regularly trading on cryptocurrency exchanges.That means they consistently hold 25–40 percent of the circulating supply of ETH and account for only 5-18 percent of transaction volume, Chainalysis said.Further, using a vector autoregression (VAR) model, commonly used in financial time series analysis, Chainalysis found that ETH prices follow bitcoin (BTC) prices. That is, on average, a 1 percent increase in BTC price yesterday leads to a 1.1 percent increase in ETH price today. The study, however, did not find a “statistically significant” impact of BTC prices on ETH’s intraday volatility.The study also analyzed the impact of whales sending and receiving funds to and from exchanges using a VAR model. It found that funds sent do impact volatility but not price, while funds received have no impact either on prices or intraday volatility.“These preliminary findings are consistent with the literature on stock market prices and volatility,” Chainalysis concluded. “Academics have found that large anomalous fluctuations in traded volumes of particular stocks, notably the S&P 500, tend to impact volatility and not price levels.”Ethereum image via Shutterstock; charts via Chainalysis"

It smelled like rain.","From a British mom who works from home as a “bitcoin hobbyist,” to a ripped Kiwi technologist with a thick beard, people who work with bitcoin gathered to joke about Crypto Twitter and nodes.They were in Amsterdam for one of the most prestigious security conferences in the blockchain industry. But on this rainy Friday, they had also come for something more.“It feels like family,” the hobbyist trader said.Many of them paid for beers and snacks with bitcoin, using a lighting-friendly wallet and a point-of-sale device developed by the Amsterdam-based startup Bitonic, founded in 2012.“We may have lost some of the market,” Bitonic’s head of strategy, Daan Kleiman, told CoinDesk about the decision to focus purely on bitcoin, “but we have the freedom to make our own decisions without the pressure from venture capital. This makes our growth very natural and healthy in this complex market with a lot of scams and unrealistic promises.”But growth wasn’t the main focus the following weekend at the conference itself. Instead, the panels and presentations at Breaking Bitcoin 2019 explored the premier cryptocurrency’s vulnerabilities, from political attack vectors to security holes.At the operational end of the spectrum, there was bitcoin advocate Udi Wertheimer, who revealed Wasabi Wallet’s privacy features could actually be leveraged to de-anonymize users. (The wallet’s creator promptly replied on Twitter to discuss issues from the presentation.)Then there were the higher-level challenges, such as the economic and social risks of bitcoin. On a panel exploring the topic, vagabond bitcoin consultant Felix Weis said if the majority of bitcoin users continue to trust custodians and exchanges to hold the private keys to their assets, then such companies could gain disproportionate sway over the technology’s evolution.Each talk left the audience feeling that addressing this specific issue could bring bitcoin one step closer to long-lasting value. And although building a sustainable-yet-decentralized form of money is still an ambitious goal, at best, nothing excites bitcoiners quite like a seemingly insurmountable challenge.Despite how few people spend bitcoin today, with Chainalysis estimating merchant activity represents only 1.3 percent of bitcoin activity, many developers at the conference in Amsterdam use bitcoin for freelance work on open source projects.Such was the case with both Weis and Lightning Labs co-founder Olaoluwa Osuntokun, who paid contributors to his startup’s implementation of the bitcoin scaling solution lightning. From Osuntokun’s perspective, regulation presents a larger barrier to bitcoin adoption than the small pool of users.“The biggest risk likely comes from state-level actors attempting to stifle the development of software related to bitcoin,” Osuntokun told CoinDesk. “Network-level partitioning attacks, and attempts to control the import/export of mining equipment.”During the social risks panel with Weis, Bitcoin Magazine editor Aaron van Wirdum concurred that new regulations like the upcoming requirement by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) – which could force companies to share customer data across jurisdictions any time users send money from one exchange or custodian to another – presents a salient risk to bitcoin users’ privacy and the ability of companies to uphold a cypherpunk ethos.Yet the vibe at Breaking Bitcoin was optimistic, even exuberant. Along those lines, several conference attendees were independent researchers presenting prospective solutions to small, specific problems with using bitcoin.“I’ve progressed from someone who was excited about [bitcoin],” Seoul Bitcoin Meetup founder Ruben Somsen told CoinDesk, “to someone who explains it at meetups, to now potentially contributing something.”Somsen was there presenting his idea for a bitcoin-related protocol for instant off-chain transactions without the hassle of lightning channels.To conclude his presentation, in a way that epitomized the conference’s gamification of criticism, Somen answered audience questions poking holes in his proposal. After all, as Bitcoin Core developer Matt Corallo said during a panel about lightning:“Bitcoin is still in beta … decentralization is an experiment.”Olaoluwa Osuntokun (right) plays a lightning-based game by Donnerlab while onlookers bid from mobile wallets to play the next round.

The price, however, is still down 78 percent from the record high of $1,431 registered in January 2018.Further, the cryptocurrency has retraced meager 16 percent of the sell-off from $1,431 to $82. On the other hand, BTC has retraced more than 40 percent of the bear market slide and is currently trading at a 15-month high of $10,800.Looking forward, ether looks set to extend the ongoing rally, as technical charts are biased bullish.The 50- and 100-candle price averages on the three-day chart have produced a bullish crossover for the first time since in two years. It is worth noting that prices had rallied by more than 900 percent in three months following the confirmation of the bull cross in May 2017.So, if history is a guide, then the cryptocurrency looks set to challenge the April 2018 low of $364 in the next couple of months. A break higher would expose resistance at $401 – 23.6 percent Fibonacci retracement of the bear market drop.Supporting the bullish case is the solid rise in ether’s non-price or on-chain metrics in the last few months. For instance, ETH volumes on decentralized applications (DApps) registered record highs in April, according to crypto analytics firm Diar.Meanwhile, network activity, as represented by daily gas usage, rose to lifetime highs in May.

New York-based payments startup Flexa just raised that amount ...","Apr 11, 2019 at 16:00 UTC",Consider yourself $14.1 million closer to buying your morning coffee with bitcoin.,"New York-based payments startup Flexa just raised that amount in a private token sale involving Pantera Capital, 1kx, Nima Capital, Access Ventures and others.The startup’s token, Flexacoin, is an ethereum-based ERC-20 token that will eventually be used by developers and businesses to stake value on Flexa’s network for merchant payment processing.While Flexa co-founder Tyler Spalding declined to specify which merchants will accept bitcoin through this app, video tests show users buying Starbucks with it. (A Starbucks spokesperson told CoinDesk it is not working with Flexa.)Spalding emphasized that Flexa is a business-to-business startup. Shoppers won’t need to hold or interact with Flexacoins at all. Flexa co-founder Trevor Filter said the details related to such governance and participation are still under development.“The long-term goal is to give over the network to the merchants,” Filter added. “A sort of consortium of their own that allows them to accept crypto.”Stepping back, Flexa is one of several companies to fundraise over the past six months through a private token sale without equity options. The predictions market startup Numerai announced a similar raise in March.Access Ventures partner TJ Abood told CoinDesk his firm would have been interested in an equity offering as well. But as he’s also satisfied with Flexacoin because it allows his firm to participate in growing the network.Businesses, from Access Ventures to merchants, can stake Flexacoin to the network and earn token rewards in a model comparable to proof-of-stake systems like Cosmos or Tezos. Flexa plans to launch a custodial crypto wallet app for its network, with users being able to spend crypto at point-of-sale with a type of QR code scan, similar to Apple Pay.“We wanted the total Flexacoin supply to represent how much money can flow through the system right now,” Spalding told CoinDesk, adding that the network will launch on May 13. “All the participants earn money.”Unlike Numerai’s token-fueled platform, Flexa’s network is not blockchain-based. Flexa’s approach to ethereum-compatibility, without complete reliance on that network, fit into Abood’s investment strategy.“We subscribe to the idea of being a user-owner. Any company that we invest in, we immediately look to be a user,” Abood said. “Making use of the developer tools and all the system tools that exist to be able to deliver a superior product, that’s what drives us.”On the other hand, 1kx cofounder Lasse Clausen told CoinDesk his firm also plans to become a staker because he believes for-profit tokenized networks are inherently better than traditional businesses. Speaking to Flexa’s symbiotic merchant acquisition strategy, Clausen added:“If Flexa were a traditional for-profit venture, how would merchants be able to trust them that they won’t end up raising fees once they have reached enough network effects?”Instead of building a blockchain-based network, Spalding described Flexa’s protocol as an “elegant pipe” that processes payments from various cryptocurrency networks, including bitcoin, ethereum, bitcoin cash and litecoin, to the merchant’s own payment processing system for direct bank transfers.“We wanted to build essentially the Stripe for these type of transactions,” Filter said.Abood said this merchant-oriented structure could entice mainstream brands that are crypto-curious by offering the ability to accept bitcoin without risk. According to Spalding, Flexa will partner with exchange platforms for liquidity on the back-end. Plus, the Flexacoin collateral could be used to compensate if there’s an issue with blockchain settlement.“Flexa plays a critical role in blockchain adoption at-large because it is bridging this digital payments landscape into a brick-and-mortar setting,” Abood said. “It’s opening up the idea of spending cryptocurrency to a much broader audience.”Filter described the Flexa protocol as bolting merchant’s traditional infrastructure to a crypto-friendly bridge, rather than relying on debit cards or credit cards. Since the process uses crypto wallets, there’s no personal information exposed the way a credit card payment would.“I don’t think that blockchains are good for many things,” Spalding added. “But, they are amazingly powerful for fraud-free payments.”In the future, Flexa plans to add support for various exchange-issued stablecoins and other crypto assets. Until then, the focus is on partnering with exchanges and merchants to make custom on-and-off ramps via the Flexa protocol.“A driving source in [mainstream] adoption will be the availability to accept cryptocurrency and that’s a merchant decision,” Abood concluded.Coffeeshop image via Shutterstock"

It could also be public blockchain in the future, but I think it will be hybrid – that is, a combination of public and private blockchains.”When the development of the blockchain is completed, Samsung may also move to launch a “Samsung Coin” token, according to the report.The person said:“The market expects Samsung Coin to come out, but the direction has not yet been decided.”If the company develops a public blockchain in the future, then Samsung Coin could be traded publicly on cryptocurrency exchanges just like bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH). Samsung could also bring blockchain technology to its payments app Samsung Pay, but the move is not yet decided, according to the source.Samsung’s blockchain task force has been in active development for at least a year, and is working on a number of projects, according to the report.Two months ago, the company made a leap into the blockchain arena with the unveiling of its flagship cellphone, the Galaxy S10, which has the ability to store cryptocurrency private keys and other features such as support blockchain-based digital signatures.In March, Samsung officially revealed the cryptocurrency wallet, which is compatible with ether (ETH) and ethereum-based ERC20 tokens, although notably not bitcoin in early glimpses. According to some reports, the wallet is not yet available in some jurisdictions.The S10 also supports decentralized apps (dapps) such as crypto gaming platform Enjin, beauty community Cosmee, crypto collectibles platform CryptoKitties and merchant payments service CoinDuck.Edit (14:40 UTC): Corrected an error arising from translation.

Back then, the cryptocurrency had rallied 73 percent from $0.3350 to $0.5820.The rally seen this month appears modest in front of the stellar gains registered in September 2018. The cryptocurrency, however, may produce much bigger gains in the following months as a widely tracked long-term technical indicator is about to turn bullish.The upward sloping 50-day moving average (MA), currently at $0.3434, looks set to cross above the 200-day MA, currently at $0.3470, in the next few days.That would confirm a “golden crossover” – a pattern which indicates long-term bullish reversal, according to technical analysis theory. Many experts, however, call it a lagging indicator, as the MA studies are based on historical data.An impending golden crossover, therefore, could be considered a product of XRP’s rise from the April 25 low of $0.2825 to the recent high of $0.4787 rather than a hint of further gains.That said, XRP is still down 87 percent from the record of $3.30 reached on Jan. 4, 2018 and far from being overbought. The golden crossover, therefore, may invite chart-driven buying, leading to the next leg higher in the cryptocurrency.As seen above, the 50-day MA is fast closing on the 200-day MA.The crossover confirmation could be followed by a convincing break above the recent high of $0.4787 as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) is currently biased bullish at 61.00 and well short of the overbought territory (above-70).Further, the Chaikin money flow index (CMF) is printing positive, indicating strong buying pressure.XRP jumped 34 percent in seven days to May 19, validating seller exhaustion seen near $0.28 in the first 4.5-months.So far, however, the follow-through to that bearish-to-bullish trend change has not been bullish. In fact, the cryptocurrency formed a hanging man candle last week – a bearish development.The outlook, however, would again turn from bullish-to-bearish only if the price ends below $0.3593 at this Sunday’s close (UTC).Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.XRP image via Shutterstock; Charts by Trading View"

Every third BitBay user also has ETH, Lisk and Ripple. Nine out of ten respondents consider digital currency to be a safe means of performing transactions, though the vast majority of respondents have not made a purchase using cryptocurrencies. Only 25 percent made at least one transaction. Of those that used cryptocurrency as a currency, 15 percent bought electronics, three percent bought food, and two percent used it to travel. Keep in mind that the regulatory position of cryptocurrency in Poland and much of Central Europe is still in flux.The first two categories also appear among the most common answers to the question related to future purchases.

If the dapp economy is sputtering at that point, Lubin will send Song 69.74 BTC.For Lubin to win, Ethereum needs to have five unique dapps achieving 10,000 or more daily active users and 100,000 monthly active users for any six calendar months in any 12-calendar-month period up to and including May 23, 2023.To be clear, this is not a small bet for either side, and both acknowledge that whichever side wins, it will hurt badly. It’s also possible the loser will be giving up considerably more money in 2023 than they would today.When the bet was first made, on May 14, 2018, BTC was trading at $8,577. So, Lubin had effectively bet $598,190 based on prices at the time. That’s $564,307 at today’s prices.The difference in ETH was much more stark, however. At the time of the bet last year, ETH was trading at $722.86. So, Song effectively bet $586,095 at prices at the time – but only $168,030 at today’s prices.If he wins, Song was very clear that the BTC will go straight to him. “I want it to hurt for you,” Song told Lubin. “I don’t want you to feel like you are donating to charity.”“I’m fine with that,” Lubin replied.The terms have slowly been hammered out over the last year since the bet was first spoken into existence. The two sides have been working on a shared document that they’ve committed to share with CoinDesk once the final piece is in place: settling on a public arbiter.“Jimmy’s thesis was that there would be no significant applications on blockchain, and the only thing relevant in blockchain was bitcoin,” Lubin said on CoinDesk Live. “My thesis is bitcoin is awesome, and there’s a narrow set of use cases built on bitcoin and that’s wonderful. We love that, but decentralized applications are also really useful.”There are some definitions of daily active users in the document. The point, Song explained, was for the dapp in question to achieve something like the numbers an Android mobile app would need to be deemed an early success.Critically, Song argued that the transactions only count if they are on chain. It doesn’t matter who pays for the gas to put them on chain, he agreed (the startup itself could front that), but it needs to hit the base layer.The sticking point had been what it meant to spend money, but once Song agreed that it didn’t have to be paid by the user – as long as it hit the chain – terms were done.Lubin proposed a hug and Song accepted.You can watch the full exchange here:All bets are… off? on? @ethereumJoseph & @jimmysong are hashing it out now at #Consensus2019 Watch live on Periscope:https://t.co/FtJVbOEMlJ#CoinDeskLIVE— CoinDesk (@coindesk) May 14, 2019At its core, the bet hinges on whether the decentralized web will come to fruition – and whether ethereum will deliver it.Song argued that centralized technology will always be faster and easier to develop on, and that’s why he doesn’t believe the decentralized web has a future.“The only reason dapps exist is to raise money from gullible people or from greedy FOMO people, and that’s essentially what the ethereum platform has done,” Song said.It’s possible that the world could change in a way that doesn’t fit the terms of the bet. For example, Felix Salmon and Ben Horowitz made a bet five years ago that bitcoin would be widely used in payments. Five years later, Horowitz lost that bet, and yet at the same time he’s still won by investing successfully in crypto.To that point, Lubin noted:“It’s possible that there are many many successful applications on ethereum that are sufficiently decenteralized and they don’t hit exactly those two criteria. So it’s possible I will lose and the ecosystem will be strong.”Screenshot of Joe Lubin and Jimmy Song via CoinDesk Live/PeriscopeCorrection (May 15, 18:57 UTC): According to the terms of the bet, ethereum needs to have five unique dapps achieving 10,000 or more daily active users, not 15, as was previously reported."

payments experiment that has seen participation from hundreds of ...","Apr 5, 2019 at 12:00 UTC","Bitcoin’s lightning torch will soon burn out, putting an end to a global payments experiment that has seen participation from hundreds of recipients, from tech luminaries like Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey to users in countries cut off from parts of the world by economic sanctions.","Users taking part in the venture have been showing the power of lightning’s tech by passing a payment from one person to the next, adding a few cents worth of bitcoin with each step. The so-called “torch” has burned through at least 54 countries so far, showcasing its cross-border prowess.But because of a hard-coded transaction limit of about $170 at time of press (it’s officially 4.29 million satoshis), there’s a limit on how much bitcoin can be sent across a lightning channel at once. As such, users will only be able to pass the torch less than a dozen more times before it hits that limit.Once the torch payment hits the limit (which was put into place for safety reasons) people can no longer add 30 cents or so to the torch with each pass, as was the lightning torch tradition.Of course, it’s impossible to say what exactly what will happen to the torch until it dies out. Will the torch die out? Or, will someone simply start a new one?The pseudonymous Hodlonaut, who started the lightning torch on a whim, has been counting down the remaining spots on Twitter (now down to 10), telling CoinDesk that he is not planning to start up a second torch.When asked whether they’re planning to start another torch as this one dies out, Hodlonaut responded: “I don’t think so. Maybe something else ;)”The possible end to the lightning torch raises what might be an obvious question: what are the key takeaways?Participants argue that, for better or worse, the lightning torch has shown that the technology is unstoppable, as it crossed into more than 50 countries with ease. If one country implements policies that are unfair, bitcoin can bypass this, because payments can’t be stopped by any one person or entity.In addition to passing through so many countries, that the torch was sent to Iran seemed to vindicate this view. Iranian bitcoin user Ziya Sadr tried to receive the torch, but some torch bearers were too scared to pass it to him due to U.S. sanctions potentially making it illegal to do so. But, when an unknown user from Wales passed Sadr the torch, it seemed to secure the view that bitcoin’s lightning is borderless.Sadr agrees with these sentiments. “Bitcoin and lightning are truly censorship resistant and people manifested this too during this very public and bold experiment!” he told CoinDesk, adding:“Bitcoin is borderless and it will not conform to state-backed sanctions and national politics.”According to bitcoin enthusiast and entrepreneur Akin Ferdinandez, the experiment “showed clearly that the world is actually just one place, and with the right tools it’s possible to traverse national borders and reach everyone as if there were no barriers between anyone.”“The torch entering and leaving Iran unimpeded is all the proof you need to show this is true. People really can get along if given the chance,” Ferdinandez told CoinDesk.Hodlonaut also pointed out some of the lesser-known facts of the experiment. For example, a group of Venezuelans received the torch while the country was roiling amid a power outage. With no electricity, they powered their lightning node with a motorcycle battery.Ferdinandez, who carried the torch last week, thinks it shows that even when a technology is early on, it can do good.“It also shows once again that a small number of people can have a hugely significant global impact in a short amount of time if their thinking is right and they have the focus and skills to execute in software,” Ferdinandez (who also goes by the moniker Beautyon) told CoinDesk, adding:“The lesson here is, ‘Do not underestimate bitcoin’.”But while the experiment shows the latent promise of the technology, it also shows how unready it is, Charlie Lee, creator of litecoin, argued to CoinDesk.“I think the torch shows [that] using lightning by running one’s own node and lightning is still not easy enough. Most torch holders end up using a custodial solution, which is not ideal,” Lee told CoinDesk.“Custodial” wallets like Bluewallet have recently sprung up. Lightning users, including those who have participated in the lightning torch, have flocked to them because they make lightning easier to use. They don’t need to set up their own lightning node, a time-consuming process that requires a lot of hard drive space, for instance.While this sounds great, it’s “not ideal” as Lee put it, because custodial wallets have full control of users funds — a characteristic that sort of defeats the purpose of bitcoin as a digital currency that users are intended to have complete control over.“We still have lots of work to do to make lightning easy to use,” Lee said.This technological immaturity is embedded in the very reason the lightning torch is near its end, about to reach its transaction limit. The limit is there for a reason, as it’s one of the features put in place by developers to keep users safe since lightning is still a budding technology susceptible to bugs.Another outcome of the experiment is it has unexpectedly turned into a crowd sourced charity project.Once the torch hits the transaction limit, Hodlonaut and the community plans to donate the torch to the non-profit Bitcoin Venezuela, dedicated to spreading the word about bitcoin as a currency alternative in the economically troubled country.Hodlonaut tweeted:“[These] guys really deserve all the support we can give them. They will receive the #LNTrustChain torch, but that only amounts to around $170.”To expand the donation effort to not only just the few who get to carry the lightning torch, Hodlonaut started a parallel donation effort on Tallycoin, a fundraising platform accepting solely bitcoin and lightning payments.Without a transaction limit to worry about, the fundraiser has snowballed much more money than the torch, attracting has attracted 235 donations totaling 0.38672 bitcoin, worth about $1,553 at time of press.Torch image via Shutterstock"

The company was first rumored to be considering a token sale last month, to make up for an $850 million shortfall in funds.The exchange’s chief technology officer, Paolo Ardoino, previously said that Bitfinex had closed the $1 billion sale last week, with investments apparently ranging from $1 million to $100 million.It was not immediately clear who specifically had bought into this fundraising round, but on Friday, Bitfinex said that it had sold 100 percent of its tokens, in return for $1 billion in USDT.“The overwhelming response and expedient execution of the token sale represents a new milestone for Bitfinex and the greater Blockchain community,” the post said, adding:“In addition to our excitement around bringing such an unprecedented and powerful token to the heart of our community, the Bitfinex team remains dedicated to continuing to grow and develop core infrastructure for our industry as a whole.”The exchange has said in its white paper that it will buy back some percent of its circulating exchange tokens every month, based on its monthly revenue or potentially the unlocking of its funds by a payment processor, Crypto Capital.The New York Attorney General’s office first revealed that Bitfinex lost access to the funds held by Crypto Capital in April, though the exchange reportedly provided conflicting stories about why.In recent court filings, Bitfinex said its funds were seized by authorities in the U.S., Poland and Portugal, but that it was working to regain access.Bitfinex image via Shutterstock"

6.7 percent and ethereum and litecoin loans 3.6 percent each.","Apr 25, 2019 at 13:00 UTC",Genesis Global Trading’s cryptocurrency lending arm continues to grow – and diversify beyond short sellers.,"Announced Thursday, Genesis Global Capital wrote $425 million of crypto loans in the first quarter, bringing its total originations since the business launched in March 2018 to $1.53 billion.Moreover, Genesis’ portfolio of outstanding loans grew 17 percent from the end of last year to $181 million as of March 30. (The average loan is paid off in six weeks, which explains why the amount outstanding at the end of the period is so much smaller than the volume produced during the quarter.)Of that loan book, bitcoin-denominated loans made up 68 percent, XRP loans 6.7 percent and ethereum and litecoin loans 3.6 percent each.But perhaps most notably, short sellers now account for only 3 to 5 percent of Genesis’ bitcoin loans, down from about half in early 2018, Michael Moro, the CEO of Genesis’ trading and lending businesses, told CoinDesk.The ability to sell crypto short, or bet that its price would fall by selling borrowed coins, “was a missing piece for a long time, something that exists in any other existing established world. You can short gold, stocks, why can’t you short cryptocurrency?” Moro said, explaining why Genesis’ loans were initially so popular for this purpose, adding:“But this speculative bet on the downside of bitcoin started to disappear towards the end of 2018 and now it doesn’t exist.”The predominant category of borrowers for Genesis now is exchanges and over-the-counter (OTC) trading desks, which prefer to keep clients’ funds in cold, or offline, storage and settle trades with borrowed coins, he said.If interest in shorting bitcoin has dwindled, that’s not the case for other cryptocurrencies.“Short sellers pretty much exist in altcoins: ether, litecoin,” Moro said. “Maybe there is some kind of bitcoin maximalism built-in in long term, or the cost of shorting it is too high.”There was also “a lot of short interest in XRP” during the third quarter of 2018, “but that trend steadily diminished towards the end of the year and hasn’t reignited thus far in 2019,” according to Genesis’ quarterly report released Thursday.In the report, Genesis shows a clear correlation between the price movements and borrowing activity of the company’s clients. And as ether and litecoin prices go down, the amount of loans rises, Genesis’ charts show.Interestingly, shorting patterns for different cryptos vary, the analysis shows. For example, for bitcoin, so far in 2019 there is little correlation to be seen between the volume of loans and the price.For ether and litecoin, the link is clearer: as the price declines, people borrow more coins, and as it goes up they pay back the loans. However, “unlike ETH, LTC borrow returns preceded major rallies rather than trailed – indicating better information or better understanding of momentum in the asset,” the report says.For example, in early February, there was an uptick in ether shorting when the coin was trading at $100; “loans outstanding ballooned to the highest level over the quarter,” the report says. They dropped 30 percent on February 7, after the price went up to $120. A week later, the price rallied again to $140, lowering the appetite to short.“Our borrowers likely covered shorts after [the] price had already moved against their positions,” the report suggests.As for litecoin shorting: in mid-March, clients borrowed a lot as the price was around $60, “another level speculators believed to be a top. But that belief was not correct and yet again, the shorts covered before the price rallied swiftly to $90. Like clockwork, they re-engaged after the price established itself in the $80-90 range,” the report says.Genesis borrows crypto from “whale” investors, including some individual early bitcoiners, Moro said. The firm borrows at a 4 to 5 percent interest rate and lends at 6.5 to 7.5 percent; the interest is paid in crypto.The company doesn’t hold these coins in cold storage, Moro said: As soon as a borrower pays back crypto, it gets lent out to another client as soon as possible from the hot wallet.“Every coin we have is for lending,” he said.Another, newer part of Genesis’ business is fiat loans, although it’s still in a pilot phase. Launched at the end of 2018, cash loans now account for 10 percent of Genesis’ portfolio.The clients on this side are hedge funds that want to get some extra operational cash without using their clients’ funds, Moro says. They post 120 percent collateral in crypto and are subject to margin calls if the fiat value of it falls below 105 percent.The crypto lending market is starting to get more competitive, with firms like BlockFi and Celsius entering the fray. Moro believes the popularity of crypto loans and crypto-collateralized cash loans is due to the fact that investors want to hold their bitcoin, and to the general maturing of the market.He concluded:“No one wants to sell bitcoin and people want more of it. As for the institutional investor crowd, many entered the market in 2017, and they are used to [being able to] go long and go short, so you have a match of people who want to lend and borrow. Back in 2014-2015, we didn’t have borrowing demand, these people just were not in business yet.”Michael Moro image via CoinDesk archives"

Currently, users need to wait an hour to initialize a lightning channel, but with a technology that Bitrefill is calling “turbo channels,” they’re looking to make that set-up process more smooth for would-be transactors.It just goes to show, as promising as lightning is for scaling bitcoin, developers are still working out all the kinks.Lightning, in general, is quite fast, allowing for transactions to be sent instantaneously, even across the world. But before users can take advantage of this speed, they first need to convert their bitcoin into lightning, which is generally not an instant process. Doing so takes six “confirmations” on the bitcoin blockchain, a wait of roughly 60 minutes, to know the transaction has been settled securely and the network has officially accepted the transaction.With the new Thor Turbo app, users can bypass the initial wait by opening a “turbo channel” with Bitrefill of any size, which they can pay for in bitcoin, ethereum, dash, litecoin, dogecoin. Their technology is based on an idea by developer Martin Habovštiak, which was later put into practice by developer Anton Kumaigorodskiy in Bitcoin Lightning Wallet.Bitrefill CCO John Carvalho said in a statement:“We want to show the world what’s possible with ‘layer 2’ scaling technology. Words can’t do justice to the feeling of using bitcoin instantaneously. Everyone needs to try this, and once they do, they will never go back. This expands the entire paradigm of what’s possible for internet commerce.”Bitrefill is one of the companies that’s been following lightning the longest and most aggressively, even sending one of the first trial payments. The team launched Thor in January to make it easier to receive lightning payments. Thor Turbo is an additional feature that makes it faster for a user to get set up to send lightning payments.That said, Bitrefill knows that the service it offers is risky, as the underlying lightning technology still has lingering bugs, making it risky to use.“Some will call us reckless, but we’re here to pull bitcoin forward and make onboarding the world to bitcoin and lightning as frictionless as possible,” said Carvahlo.Turbo blades image via Shutterstock "

The package also installed a rootkit that prevented the malware’s removal.The firm said it contacted the hosting provider of the attack servers and the issuer of the rootkit certificate.“As a result, the attack servers were taken down and the certificate was revoked,” it said.Notably, the cybersecurity firm said the attack used sophisticated tools like those used by nation states, a factor that indicates elite digital weaponry is becoming more readily accessible to cyber criminals.The package was also written using Chinese language tools and placed on Chinese language servers, according to the firm.Guardicore said:“The Nansh0u campaign is not a typical crypto-miner attack. It uses techniques often seen in APTs [advanced persistent threats] such as fake certificates and privilege escalation exploits. While advanced attack tools have normally been the property of highly skilled adversaries, this campaign shows that these tools can now easily fall into the hands of less than top-notch attackers.”The firm said the campaign demonstrates that strong credentials are vital in protecting companies’ assets.“This campaign demonstrates once again that common passwords still comprise the weakest link in today’s attack flows. Seeing tens of thousands of servers compromised by a simple brute-force attack, we highly recommend that organizations protect their assets with strong credentials as well as network segmentation solutions,” the report concluded.Infected network image via Shutterstock"

Research. News; Learn; Research. Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Jun 10, 2019 at 04:00 UTC",Michael J. Casey is the chairman of CoinDesk’s advisory board and a senior advisor for blockchain research at MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative.,"The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers.Advances in cryptography are converging to help developers bring blockchain applications closer to the core decentralizing principles on which this technology is founded.Inventions such as atomic swaps, zk-SNARKS and Lightning-based smart contracts are allowing developers to realize the dream of true peer-to-peer transactions in which neither party, nor an outside intermediary, can act maliciously. Witness the rising number of non-custodial and decentralized exchange (DEX) services for trading crypto assets.This is exciting. But it also shines a light on another big problem that has curtailed the widespread adoption of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology: secure key management.For too long, the most reliable means of protecting the private keys that afford the holder control over an underlying crypto asset have been too clunky, insufficiently versatile, or difficult to implement on scale. User experience has been sacrificed in return for security.Now, some big strides in another hugely important field of cryptography – secure multiparty computation, or MPC – point to a potential Holy Grail situation of both usability and security in a decentralized system.Progress in this field was marked last week by Tel Aviv-based KZen’s public announcement of the specs for its new ZenGo wallet. ZenGo uses MPC, along with other sophisticated cryptographic tools such as zero-knowledge proofs and threshold cryptography, to share signing responsibility for a particular cryptocurrency address among a group of otherwise non-trusting entities.The beauty of the KZen model is that security is no longer a function of one or more entities maintaining total control over a distinct private key of their own – the core point of vulnerability in cryptocurrency management until now. Instead the key is collectively derived from individual fragments which are separately generated by multiple, non-trusting computers.The model draws on the genius of MPC cryptography.With this approach, multiple non-trusting computers can each conduct computation on their own unique fragments of a larger data set to collectively produce a desired common outcome without any one node knowing the details of the others’ fragments.The private key that executes the transaction is thus a collectively generated value; at no point is a single, vulnerable computer responsible for an actual key. (KZen’s site includes a useful explainer on how it all works.)KZen is not the only provider of MPC solutions for blockchain key management. Unbound, another Israeli company, is going after the enterprise marketplace with its MPC solutions for crypto security.Unbound’s prolific (if blatantly pro-MPC) blog offers different angles on the same argument.It makes a repeated case for why MPC is superior to the two preferred approaches to crypto security of the moment: hardware security modules (HSM), on which hardware wallets like Ledger and Trezor are built, and multi-signature (multisig) technologies, which are favored by exchanges.If KZen and Unbound are to be believed, MPC solutions resolve both the hot-versus-cold trade-off in key management and the dilemma of self-versus-managed custody.Cold wallets, in which keys are stored in an entirely offline environment out of attackers’ reach, are quite secure so long as they remain in that offline state. (Though you really don’t want to lose that piece of paper on which you printed out your private key.)But bringing them into a transactable, online environment poses an overly cumbersome challenge when you want to use those keys to send money. That’s perhaps not a problem if you’re just a HODLer who transacts rarely but it’s a serious limitation to blockchain technology’s prospects for transforming overall global commerce.On the other hand, hot wallets have, until now, been notoriously vulnerable.Whether it’s the relentless “SIM jack” attacks on people’s phones that are emptying out both hosted (third-party custodial) wallets and on-phone self-custody holdings, retail participants’ horror stories are legion. And, of course, we all know the stories of custodial exchanges being hacked – from Japan, to Hong Kong, to Canada, to  Malta.At the same time, the solution that regulated institutional investors are currently seeking – that custodians and exchanges build Fort Knox-like “military-grade” custody solutions  – inherently contain a compromise.Not only does this approach fail to resolve the dependence on a third-party, but there are serious doubts about whether any such solution can be forever safe from hackers, who are constantly improving their methods for getting over firewalls. In best-case scenarios, the constant IT upgrades becomes a massive money suck.None of this is not to say that existing security technologies are useless.Ledger and Trezor’s hardware devices – a more nimble form of cold wallet – are widely used by individuals who are uncomfortable with both external third-party custody and online, on-device self-custody wallets. And, separately, multi-signature (multisig) solutions, in which an m-of-n quorum of keys are required to execute a transaction, have proven robust enough to be used by most exchanges.But in both cases, vulnerabilities have been exposed. And to a large extent those risks come down to the fact that, regardless of the surrounding security model’s sophistication, the all-important keys are always sitting at single points of failure.Just last week, researchers demonstrated how they could hack into a remote hardware security module. The irony: the researchers were from Ledger, which relies on HSM to secure its customers’ keys.Multisig models arguably offer protections across such attacks, because a breach requires simultaneous control of more than one key held in separate locations, but the fact is that multisig solutions have also failed because of both technical and human vulnerabilities (inside jobs).What’s more, both solutions are inherently limited by the need to customize them to particular specifications or ledgers. Crypto developer Christopher Allen pointed out last week , for example, that HSMs are particularly constrained by the fact that they are defined by government standards.And in each case, the ledger-specific design of the underlying cryptography means there is no support for the kind of multi-asset wallets that will be needed in a decentralized interoperable world of cross-chain transactions.By contrast, KZen is boasting that its key-less wallet will be a multi-ledger application from day one.To be sure, MPC remains unproven in a practical sense.For some time, the heavy resources needed to carry out these network computing functions made it a challenging, costly concept to bring into real-world environments. But rapid technical improvements in recent years have made this sophisticated technology a viable option for all kinds of distributed computing environments where trust is an issue.And key management isn’t its only application for blockchains, either. MPC technology plays a vital role in MIT-founded startup Enigma’s work on “secret contracts” as part of its sweeping plan to build the “privacy layer for the decentralized web.”(An aside: Enigma CEO and founder, Guy Zyskind, is also an Israeli. Israel has fostered a remarkable concentration of cryptographic expertise in this space.)It would be unwise to assume that MPC, or any technology for that matter, will provide a perfect, totally infallible solution to security problems. It is always true that the biggest security threats come when human beings complacently believe security is not a threat.However, if you squint hard enough, and think about how this technology’s prospects for better key management can be married to Enigma’s vision for an MPC-based secret contract layer and to the broader march toward decentralized, interoperable asset exchanges, a compelling vision of true peer-to-peer blockchain-based commerce starts to emerge.At the very least, you need to watch this space.Keys image via Shutterstock"

A recent report from Bloomberg – which cited a March 19 email to the startup’s shareholders – noted that some investors had received a 6,567 percent return on their Block.one holdings.However, the Bloomberg report may have been unclear about which investors stood to gain so much.“The buyback was designed for seed investors, who had been in for a long time, and it made room for potential future strategic shareholders in a way that didn’t unnecessarily inflate our balance sheet,” Brendan Blumer, Block.one’s CEO and one of the largest shareholders in the company, told CoinDesk.“I did not participate,” he added.Citing an email sent to shareholders on March 19, the Bloomberg report emphasizes the involvement of PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, along with noted investors Alan Howard and Louis Bacon.The source told CoinDesk that Thiel, Bacon and Howard are strategic investors that came on in July 2018, much later than the seed investors. As such, the source said, Thiel, Bacon and Howard saw a 30 percent gain on their investments – a healthy return but nowhere near the 6,567 percent trumpeted in Bloomberg’s headline.Block.one declined to share with CoinDesk the investor email that Bloomberg reviewed. It also declined to give CoinDesk a timeline for its seed investments. Still, the source said Block.one actually goes back several years.The company’s balance sheet is “stronger than ever,” the source told CoinDesk.Bloomberg reported that the company had $2.2 billion, mostly in U.S. government bonds. The investor letter said it also held 140,000 BTC. If Block.one still holds that much, it would be worth over $1 billion at face value.On Saturday, the company announced a new social media platform called Voice. The company plans to use its reserves to market the service aggressively to the public.A spokesperson for Howard declined a request for comment.

However, such activities continue to proliferate given the relatively low electricity costs in the country.Sanctions imposed by the US on Iran has even encouraged more people in Iran to mine and trade cryptocurrencies as an alternative to fiat currency.In an earlier report by CoinDesk, blockchain researcher Nima Dehqan at Tehran-based crypto startup Areatak said foreign investors from Spain, Ukraine, Armenia, and France have visited their cryptocurrency farms in Iran. Dehqan said his firm has already entered an agreement with an investor from Spain to establish a mining farm in Iran.Dehqan said foreign cryptocurrency investors are keen on farming in Iran due to the cheap electricity in the country which costs well below $0.01 per kilowatt-hour. Further adding to Iran’s appeal to cryptocurrency miners is the recent fall of the Iranian rial’s value due to sanctions imposed by the US, according to Dehqan.Image via Shutterstock."
