May 29, 2019
","Andy Cheung, Head of Operations at crypto exchange OKEx and Sonny Singh, Chief Commercial Officer of the crypto payment processor BitPay joined the Bitcoin bull talk this week, while the cryptoverse got back to their favorite ""time traveler"" for an advice. ","""USD 20,000 is a conservative prediction for Bitcoin price in 2019, as I said last year,"" Andy Cheung wrote in a recent newsletter, adding that the rally won?ôt stop here, ""because more institutional investors are coming into the market and the 2020 halving effect starts to take place.""Bitcoin price (c. USD 8,600) is up by 127% this year and more than 60% in May only.Meanwhile, in an interview with Bloomberg from May 29th, Sonny Singh said he believes that Bitcoin will keep rising, particularly with all the upcoming developments. ?úWho knows what?ôs going to happen?? he says. ?úWe didn?ôt even think about Facebook six months ago [??, it came out of nowhere, which is the most exciting part, because the industry changes so much?? he explains, and adds that this is just the start, ?újust the tip of the iceberg.?ùHe also explains the current rise of digital currency. It?ôs all about fundamentals, he says, unlike the previous upturn and downturn, which were driven by ?úhysteria??and ?úmomentum?? With AT&T, JPMorgan, Facebook, and other major companies entering the crypto space, he finds that people are seeing that digital currencies have real use cases around the world. According to Singh, these companies working with crypto or having their own coin legitimizes the digital currency industry, which also prevents government from illegalizing a particular token; it brings digital currency to billions of people across the world, and also perhaps makes other tech giants join the crypto game. As reported, there are quite a few forecasts going around, like Arthur Hayes, co-founder and CEO of cryptocurrency trading platform BitMEX, predicting that the coin will reach USD 10,000 by the end of 2019, or Jehan Chu, co-founder of Kenetic Capital, believing that Bitcoin will hit USD 30,000 by the end of the year. Meanwhile, digital currency industry analysis service Diar said yesterday that big investors accumulate Bitcoin and are driving the bull market: ?úThe number of addresses holding between 1,000 and 10,000 Bitcoins each has seen a steep rise with a whopping accumulation of 450,000 Bitcoins in less than 9-months.??That means that over 26% of circulating supply, which is USD 36 billion worth of BTC, sits in the addresses with a balance of BTC 1,000-10,000. These addresses have USD 6 billion more than in August 20018, the last time Bitcoin hit USD 8,000.However, the researchers at Bespoke Investment Group, in a note, cited by Marketwatch, reminded about the volatility which has recently increased: ?úBelieve it or not, though, the current drawdown isn?ôt even the largest peak to trough decline that Bitcoin has seen in its short history. In between the all-time highs from June 2011 through early 2013, Bitcoin?ôs price fell more than 93%, and then in the period between December 2013 through March 2017, the price declined nearly 84%. Needless to say, the cryptocurrency?ôs price is volatile!?ùWhile we don't know what is going to happen, the cryptoverse is again talking about the ""Bitcoin time traveler"" from the year 2025, who apparently predicts USD 100,000 by the end of this year.""On average, every year so far, the value of Bitcoin has increased by about a factor ten. From 0.1 dollar in 2010, to 1 dollar in 2011, to 10 dollar in 2012, to 100 dollar in 2013. From now on, there's a slight slowdown, as the value increased by a factor ten every two years, to 1,000 dollar in 2015, to 10,000 in 2017, 100,000 in 2019, and 1,000,000 in 2021,"" reads the original entertaining post on Reddit, published 5 years ago. It goes on to add: ""From here onwards, there's no good way of expressing its value in dollars, as the dollar is no longer used, nor is any central bank issued currency for that matter. There are two main forms of wealth in today's world. Land and cryptocurrency.""Well, let's get back to this in a few years.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

May 11, 2019
","Not much is known about the Bitcoin whales. Sure, we know they're holders of large quantities of Bitcoin, but beyond a few names most of us are in the dark as to who exactly they are and what functions they have within the BTC ecosystem.","As reported in May, there is new information intriguing the cryptoverse as reportedly the Bitcoin whale called ?òLoaded??has moved BTC 40.000 (which translated to USD 211.9 million at the time) crypto-wealth in a single transaction. Well, aside from being public champions of Bitcoin and also investors in numerous crypto-related companies, October report from blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis shows that, contrary to perceptions of volatility and pump-and-dump manipulation, their main function within markets has been to drive the price of BTC upwards.While views on what qualifies someone as a ?úBitcoin whale??vary, it would seem that it makes most sense to regard the top 100 wallets as whales, which would cover any wallet ??not including exchange wallets ??containing anything from BTC 10,000 to BTC 100,000. The reason for this categorization ??rather than, say, the top 1,000 wallets ??can be outlined by data from BitInfoCharts. For instance, in the space of the two months between December 16 and February 26, the top 100 wallets, including those that belong to exchanges, saw their overall balance of BTC increase by 165,000.By contrast, the top 100 to 1,000 wallets saw their balance decline by 132,000 over this period. As explained in further detail below, what this provides is further evidence of the whales' tendency to accumulate Bitcoin during bear markets, while smaller investors tend to sell off (and vice versa).Forgetting the wallets that belong to exchanges, it's hard to pin down just who the 100 biggest BTC wallets belong to, given Bitcoin?ôs pseudonymity.However, thanks to media reports and personal admissions it is possible to provide the names of many of the individuals who belong in this list, even though it's not possible identify specific addresses. So here's a rundown of ten individuals and/or institutions likely to control some of the biggest 100 addresses:Other likely Bitcoin whales: Valery Vavilov (Bitfury co-founder); Anthony Gallippi and Stephen Pair (BitPay co-founders); Gavin Andresen (former lead Bitcoin developer); Dan Morehead (Pantera Capital co-founder/CEO); Anthony Di Iorio (early Bitcoin investor); JL van der Velde and Giancarlo Devasini (Bitfinex/Tether CEO and CFO); Peter Thiel (Partner, Founders Fund); Bill Shihara (Bittrex CEO); Song Chi-Hyung (Upbit CEO).The above list certainly isn't exhaustive, but it's possible to infer the identity of other Bitcoin whales by simply looking into who was an early BTC investor or miner, or into who founded a successful crypto-exchange, business or investment fund. In other words, the Bitcoin whales are pretty much all entrepreneurs who were quick to notice that Bitcoin offered them a massive opportunity to make lots of money.But while this profit-seeking behavior might suggest that Bitcoin whales are responsible for much of the volatility the market experiences, research suggests that their influence on the market is more positive than negative.The report from Chainalysis, for instance, revealed that the 32 largest bitcoin wallets ""traded against the herd, buying on price declines."" In fact, a 2017 research paper found that, even as far back as 2011, the largest traders were responsible more for upward movements in Bitcoin's price, rather than declines.All of which suggests that, even if Bitcoin whales arguably have too much power over the market, they've long been pushing to make this market a success.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

","As it was estimated by many analysts recently, bitcoin price jumped above the psychologically important level of USD 10,000 and even surpassed USD 11,000 for a couple of hours before crashing back into the USD 10,000 zone. Majority of altcoins are also in green today. (Updated on 15:03 UTC: the latest market data have been added.)","After dropping by more than 3% in the past hour (14:58 UTC), bitcoin trades at around USD 10,745 and is still up by more than 9% in the past 24 hours. It's also up by 23% in the past week and by 40% in the past month. Also, compared to June 22 of 2018, bitcoin is now up by 73%. Last time bitcoin was above the USD 10,000 level is March 2018. Bitcoin price today:______________________________________________________Bitcoin price chart (June 2018 - June 2019) :Also, bitcoin dominance, or the percentage of the total market capitalization, increased by almost 1 percentage point, to almost 59%. The total market capitalization is up by more than 7%, to USD 324 billion. ?úThe bounce back of bitcoin has been fairly extraordinary,??said George McDonaugh, chief executive and co-founder of London-based blockchain and cryptocurrency investment firm KR1 Plc.. According to him, ?úmoney didn?ôt leave the asset behind, it just sat on the sidelines waiting to get back in.??<...>I expect prices to surge after this mental marker is reached. Bitcoin is a powerful beast", it forces you to question money, politics, value and profit. Many will decide, as thousands to everyday, to buy some and see what happens, he said," stressing that """"caution is however strongly advised"""" as """"we will see huge corrections again.""""Also", as reported, Tyler Winklevoss, CEO of exchange Gemini, said this week that if Bitcoin breaks USD 10,0, it?ôs going to break USD 15,0, as ?úhe 2nd time breaking 10k will make it feel more ?úreal??to many people.??Others are also waiting for the FOMO (fear of missing out) buying to kick in, while scammers are getting ready, also.Meanwhile, among the top ten coins by market capitalization, XRP is the second best performer after bitcoin (+10%). Ether advanced by almost 8% and surpassed the USD 300 level, where it was in August 2018. Ether is also up by 16% in the past week, 27% in the past month, but is down by 35% in the past 12 months.

","Bitcoin is just at the beginning of its bull run, and it will easily surpass its all-time-high, said Fundstrat Global Advisors??research chief Tom Lee.","According to him, what could power the strong rise in Bitcoin?ôs price is FOMO (fear of missing out). On Monday, in the note to clients Lee wrote that Bitcoin can reach as high as USD 40,000, Bloomberg reported, noting that it might happen ""within a few months"". However, Lee later tweeted that Fundstrat is ""not predicting USD 40k by Dec."", without elaborating. In either case, according to the note, the trigger for FOMO would be a breach of the USD 10,000 level, supported by better market transparency and integrity. In January 2019, he said that USD 25,000 per Bitcoin forecast is a good value for the cryptocurrency. Now, Bitcoin is trading above the USD 9,000 level for the fourth day in a row. It has been at this level only 4% of its history, Lee stressed in an interview with CNBC.?úWe?ôre deep into a bull market, and people are pretty silent about it?? the bitcoin bull said. Facebook has just announced its Libra coin yesterday, but it?ôs not slowing down Bitcoin, which saw a rise of 146% this year alone.In regards to how it?ôll progress from now on, as a guest on CNBC?ôs ?úFutures Now??on Tuesday, Lee said that Bitcoin will ultimately become a reserve currency in crypto. Furthermore, ?úI think bitcoin is easily going to take out its all-time highs??of USD 20,000 from December 2017. Facebook?ôs announcement is ?úa complete validation that mainstream is now focused on cryptocurrencies?? Lee says, and it destroys the argument of believing in blockchain, but not in cryptocurrencies. Still, the main thrust of it revolves around the idea of decentralized finance, he said. ?úI think it is more targeted at stablecoin and creating a new kind of banking system, and it?ôs very complementary to bitcoin.??And while current developments are bullish for Bitcoin and bad for stablecoin and anyone who?ôs been trying to do decentralized finance, as Lee explains, the stablecoins will likely not drop in value. Those that grow are those that are widely used, ?úthat?ôs why Tether?ôs done so well, and I think Libra?ôs ultimately going to be one of the dominant stablecoins?? though convertibility will be an issue, says Lee.

He wrote that many in the crypto sphere were hesitant to agree that the crypto winter was indeed over, saying that they are worried about persistent volatility in altcoins, fundraising issues in the digital currency market, general bearishness, and remaining concerns from crypto?ôs 2018 drop.Meanwhile, Jehan Chu, co-founder and managing partner at Kenetic Capital, a blockchain investment and advisory firm, recently estimated that bitcoin will reach USD 30,000 by the end of the year. ?úWe could go as low as the 6,000 level,??he said in an interview with Cryptonews.com, but finds that various developments, increasing number of institutions coming into the crypto space, and the announcements by major companies might potentially cause a massive rally.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

","Jehan Chu, co-founder of Kenetic Capital, a blockchain investment and advisory firm, believes that Bitcoin price will more than triple and hit USD 30,000 by the end of the year.","Talking on Bloomberg Daybreak Asia, Jehan Chu said that the combination of three important factors will drive the price upwards and fast. Firstly, he states, the story of cryptocurrency is becoming a reality, with multiple, major companies building its infrastructure and providing services. That is, according to him, going to drive adoption. ?úWhat people are really seeing now is that cryptocurrency is not going away?? he says.The second reason he gives for this massive rise is ?úa countercyclical argument?? He explains that, as people are disappointed in companies like ?úUber and Lyft IPOing the market?? they are ?úlooking for a different type of tech story and one that?ôs perhaps accessible to all.?ùThe third reason the upcoming Bitcoin halving ??when the network reduces the Bitcoin block mining reward (currently, BTC 12.5) by 50%. This happens at intervals of 210,000 blocks, which is about every four years and now is estimated to happen in May 2020. ?úTraditionally?? says Jehan Chu, ?úthat?ôs pushed the price into double digit percentage.??As reported, it is estimated that this will be the last halving to have a very significant impact on its price. Meanwhile, in November 2018, Jehan Chu stated that USD 5,500 per bitcoin is a good entry point for those who want to purchase this cryptocurrency. In December 2017, however, he estimated that Bitcoin will reach USD 50,000 by the end of 2018 and confirmed this forecast in January 2018. In December 2018, bitcoin price dropped to almost USD 3,000.However, even if Jehan Chu is right this time, not everyone is convinced that the road to the USD 30,000 is going to be smooth:Also, the co-founder now claims that Bitcoin is going to pull up other coins as well, which will benefit from Bitcoin?ôs higher prices. Jehan Chu states, though, that ?úmany of the different applications that back the cryptocurrencies of their own right, are developing their own story, and developing utility [?? these are the altcoins that have their own large market caps?? giving Ethereum as an example, which ranks two, just behind Bitcoin, with its market capitalization of USD 28.7 billion, compared with the USD 155 billion market capitalization of Bitcoin.Jehan Chu predicts great success for Ethereum as well, finding its growth, development, and adoption ?úoutstanding?? Another coin he finds interesting is Ripple, as he believes that it ?úhas made great headway in providing different types of payment currencies to many of the banks and getting key partnerships around the world."" However, when contacted by Cryptonews.com recently, Ripple declined to disclose their results and how the XRP token is being used by their partners.In regards to a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), Jehan Chu stated that it is projects like Fidelity, E*Trade, TD Ameritrade, and others that will drive the traction and volume increase, ?úand all of these different factors are going to drive adoption, regardless of whether ETF comes tomorrow or in ten years??",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

May 22, 2019
","For the last nine years since the inception of this crypto holiday, the price of Bitcoin on this very day, May 22, would show a substantial rise from the previous year, save for three instances, in 2012, in 2015 and in 2019 (but the day is not over yet.) ","This date is celebrated as the day when we all remember how, on this day in 2010, programmer Laszlo Hanyecz paid another Bitcoin talk forum user for two Papa John?ôs pizzas with 10,000 BTC. At the time, that would be worth about USD 25, but today the same amount is worth almost USD 80 million. Prior to Hanyecz?ôs craving for pizza on that faithful day, the price of Bitcoin was low and rather volatile, negotiated by individuals on the Bitcoin forum. It is recorded that the price when the Bitcoin value at the time of the pizza purchase was 0.0025 cents for 1 coin.However, just a year later, in 2011, the price is 258.7% higher, a jump that was assisted by a great number of events, including the viral video What Is Bitcoin? published by WeUseCoins in March that year (it has more than 9 million views now.) Even TIME magazine published an article about it in April. There were fewer, though notable events in 2012, like March 1st theft of about 50,000 BTC, following a security upgrade in Linode. The price fell to USD 5. Events picked up at the end of that year, like WordPress accepting bitcoins starting November, and the beginning of 2013 with BitPay surpassing 10,000 transactions in January, and Bitcoin capitalization surpassing USD 1 billion in March. By May 22, the price of this coin was USD 124, which is 1,962% higher than year before.The end of 2013 and the beginning of 2014 was a mixed bag for Bitcoin. On the one hand, USD 100 million were stolen from bitcoin wallets, China banned the coin and Norway decided against recognizing it, and there were issues with transactions in several big stock exchanges, making Bitcoin suffer a 30% decrease in price. On the other hand, many more companies and business started accepting and endorsing it, so that by May 22nd 2014, the price of a coin was USD 525.2015 was a troublesome year as in January UK-based exchange Bitstamp announced that they will be offline while investigating a hack which resulted in a theft of about 19,000 bitcoins, and two US Federal agents pleaded guilty for stealing bitcoins during their active investigation into an online black market, Silk Road market. The price that May 22nd dropped to USD 241.The end of that year and beginning of 2016 saw the Unicode Committee adopting the now famous bitcoin currency symbol (??, as well as Craig Wright announcing that he is Satoshi Nakamoto. Among quite a few other events, the price of Bitcoin rose by USD 200 from the previous year, now standing at USD 443.The following three years up to this day were monumental for the coin, seeing a massive rise from one Pizza Day to the next. And while it had its fair share of ups and downs, it always managed to come on top, surviving a difficult crypto winter and numerous issues, but also consistently attracting major players in all spheres of life, including commerce and politics. From May 22 2017 when it was USD 2,303, the price jumped to USD 8,054 on the same day in 2018, dropping to 3,242 in December, only to explode in 2019, reaching USD 8,000 mark in May this year, and later today reaching USD 7,995.This short history shows the trajectory in which, from the day when Hanyecz bought his pizzas till today, the price of Bitcoin rose by almost 320,000,000%. Not bad at all.As, we have mentioned last year, there is even a Twitter account, called @bitcoin_pizza, that only posts how much Hanyecz's pizzas are worth each day, comparing the price to the previous day.The #Bitcoin pizza is worth $79,253,225 today.

","After bitcoin expectedly breached the USD 10,000 level this past weekend and started to playing with USD 11,000, more bitcoin bulls are looking for the new inspiration as FOMO (fear of missing out) ""is already in the air.""","First, right after bitcoin jumped above USD 10,000, professional career trader Peter Brandt tweeted that ""bitcoin takes aim at USD 100,000 target."" ""BTCUSD is experiencing its fourth parabolic phase dating back to 2010. No other market in my 45 years of trading has gone parabolic on a log chart in this manner. Bitcoin is a market like no other,"" the trading veteran said. In April he predicted bitcoin at USD 50,000 within the next two years.Also, Forbes contributor, analyst Naeem Aslam, predicts that the next rally is going to be a lot stronger than the previous. ""One can call it a bubble, but this time the Bitcoin price range could very well be between USD 60,000 to USD 100,000,"" he added.Meanwhile, one of the most famous bitcoin bulls, Anthony Pompliano, co-founder and partner at Morgan Creek Digital, a digital asset management firm, is even more specific. ""I believe that Bitcoin will reach a USD 100,000 price point before December 31, 2021. My current confidence level of this happening is around 70-75%,"" he wrote in his daily newsletter. Pompliano was wrong in 2018 when he predicted that bitcoin could reach USD 50,000 by the end of that year, but he was right when in August of the same year he said that the price is likely to drop by c. 50%, to USD 3,000 before it bounces back to USD 10,000. Bitcoin reached USD 3,200 in December 2018. 
__________________________________________________________________Now, after suggesting to do your own research before buying bitcoin and reminding never invest more than you're willing to lose, Pompliano have also stressed a few things:However, as history shows, only time will tell who is right. For example, in the beginning of June, multiple analysts and traders advised against buying bitcoin when it dropped below USD 8,000. In 10 days it was above USD 9,000.""The first time bitcoin breached [USD 10,000] to the upside was in a frenzy of FOMO as most of the world was just learning what this new digital asset is all about. This time however, the rise seems much more sustainable and the current price more justifiable given the current levels of awareness and adoption,"" according to Mati Greenspan, Senior Market Analyst at eToro, a trading platform. At pixel time (14:28 UTC), bitcoin trades at c. USD 10,900 and is up by 1.95% in the past 24 hours, by 17% in the past week, 35% in the past month and by 83% in the past 12 months.Bitcoin price chart:",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

","As bitcoin price jumped by around 60% in May and competition among miners of the most popular cryptocurrency increased, Bitcoin mining difficulty reached its new all-time high today, making it more difficult for miners to win the precious reward of BTC 12.5.","Meanwhile, hash rate, or computational power of the Bitcoin network is also inching closer to its all-time high reached in October 2018. After the most recent adjustment, the mining difficulty increased by more than 11% today, while major Bitcoin mining pool BTC.com estimates it will increase by almost another 11% in less than 14 days. However, in the past, these estimates were not always accurate.Bitcoin mining difficulty:Bitcoin?ôs difficulty has been again increasing since December 2018. There were in that month two substantial drops (15.13% and 9.56%), correlating with the drop in the price of the coin. Then in the last week of December, it spiked by 10.03%, reaching 5.62 T, and has been on a slow, but steady rise ever since, with just three minor drops, until it reached 7.46 T today.The mining difficulty of Bitcoin is adjusted every two weeks (every 2016 blocks, to be precise) to maintain the normal 10-minute block time. This means that if there are many miners competing among themselves and propagating blocks in less than ten minutes, the difficulty of the next puzzle will be increased; if there are few miners and it takes them much longer to find a solution, the difficulty is decreased - both times just enough to keep block times at around 10 minutes.Bitcoin mining pool distribution in May:In other words, when bitcoin price grows, it is likely that hash rate will increase, which means that there is an increase in the number of miners entering Bitcoin?ôs ecosystem. As competition among miners increases, so does the difficulty of the network, which means that miners need to use more of their computational power to get the mining reward (currently, BTC 12.5 per block, which will be cut by 50% in a year).

Bitcoin has a strictly limited supply of 21 million coins that will ever be minted,"" Mati Greenspan, senior market analyst at the eToro trading platform, said, adding that each time we get a wave of demand, there simply aren't enough coins to go around, which pushes the price up at a rapid pace.The analyst reminded that about 4 million of bitcoins have not yet been mined and another 4 million are estimated to be lost for good. ""So, the circulating supply at the moment is closer to 13 million coins. Of those, there are a lot of people who are simply not willing to sell at any price. So the liquidity of this market is incredibly thin,"" Greenspan explained.He also stressed that bull runs aren't made in a single day and the market has been building up to this ever since the mid-December low. Moreover, the volumes have also been incredibly strong lately. ""As we know, bitcoin tends to go through some massive boom and bust cycles.<...> If the cycle repeats itself and we do see a 1,000% surge from the recent lows, that will bring the price up to USD 31,000. Given that crypto adoption is still in the very early stages, suddenly price predictions like USD 50,000 to USD 100,000 per coin don't seem so incredibly insane,"" the analyst said, stressing that this is still ""an incredibly risky investment"".""There's even a fair chance that it will go from here straight to zero.

","Bitcoin has intrinsic value, admitted a team of strategists at major investment bank JPMorgan Chase & Co and warned that the coin mirrors a boom-bust pattern of 2017.","According to the strategists, bitcoin price now surges beyond its ?úintrinsic value,??trading about twice as high as where the valuation would place it, Bloomberg reported. The team have treated Bitcoin as a commodity and have calculated its ?úcost of production??taking into account the information such as the estimated computational power, hardware energy efficiency, and electricity expense, the report said.The analysts have added, however, that ?úDefining an intrinsic or fair value for any cryptocurrency is clearly challenging. [?? views range from some researchers arguing that it has no fundamental value, to others estimating fair values well in excess of current prices.??It's wonderful that JPM is finally ready to admit that bitcoin has intrinsic value", and it's not at all surprising that they see the current price as overvalued in comparison to their calculations. Yes, bitcoin is well above the mining cost at current rates, but what JPM has failed to take into account is that frequently, when miners are running a surplus, they will start hoarding coins. By withholding supply from the market when times are flush, they aim to further limit liquidity and send prices even higher, commented Mati Greenspan, senior market analyst at eToro. Great to see JPM finally admitting that Bitcoin has intrinsic value. Now wait till they understand that miners who run a surplus tend to begin hording. https://t.co/dWCqeg6PQcThe announcement by the bank comes at the time when they're testing their much hyped JPM Coin, the centralized digital token, that may become something of interest for the broader audience. Meanwhile, other strategists are saying that this latest surge of BTC could actually be signaling the worsening of global economic cycle, as fears of recession grow and amidst the current US-China trade war, according to Business Insider. Michael Hartnett, the chief investment strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, explains that all this is further suppressing the yields on bonds that have already fallen and remain near historic lows in several major countries," while the bond prices in the US are slowly rising. Hartnett said in a recent note to clients that what investors have done is piled into a """"greed trade"""" that includes USD 127 billion in corporate and emerging-market debt.He also said that bitcoin is more appealing to investors during the times of uncertainty", and that the surge above USD 8,"000 """"confirms belief in world of negatively-yielding debt", not actually saying that the rise occurred to the greed trade, but finds it of interest that these two events occurred at the same time. Hartnett stated that BTC?ôs 2017 bubbles was one of the greatest ever and, interestingly, his team had conducted a survey conducted just before it crashed, which ?úshowed that large fund managers thought betting on bitcoin was the most crowded trade in the world?? according to Business Insider.In either case, the cryptoverse is looking for more signs that bitcoin price will continue to rise through 2019. George Kikvadze, executive vice chairman of major cryptocurrency and blockchain venture Bitfury, reminds that we're one year away from the next Bitcoin halvening, when the Bitcoin block mining reward will decrease from 12.5 to 6.25 bitcoins. It is estimated that this will be the last halvening to have a very significant impact on its price.

May 25, 2019
","Adoption is the holy grail of Bitcoin. However, as fantastic as large-scale adoption would be in theory, there remain serious questions as to whether Bitcoin and its blockchain can genuinely handle such adoption. ","Because while Bitcoin has witnessed a number of significant upgrades in recent months and years, these still haven't been substantial enough to push it anywhere near the level where most of the globe could use the cryptocurrency.Indeed, it would seem that Bitcoin's current maximum capacity isn't even 1% of that boasted by the Visa network. Nonetheless, certain Bitcoin Core developers believe that, with the successful implementation of the Lightning Network, it will be able to handle an almost indefinite number of transactions.At the time of writing, the highest number of transactions Bitcoin has processed in a single day is 490,000 (on December 14, 2017), according to Blockchain.com, which works out at just over 20,000 transactions per hour. Meanwhile, Visa is capable of processing a maximum of 65,000 transactions per second, which would work out to 234 million per hour and around 5.6 billion per day.Clearly, this comparison doesn't seem very favorable for Bitcoin, given that it suggests that Bitcoin's capacity is only 0.0087% of Visa's theoretical maximum. That said, Visa claimed (back in 2016) that it actually handles 150 million transactions per day on average, which would mean that Bitcoin's highest number of actually processed transactions works out to 0.33% of Visa's average daily number.However, as keen observers of Bitcoin will be well aware, the cryptocurrency's development community has recently introduced a number of technical updates and innovations. The most notable of these is SegWit, which removes signature data from each block (thereby freeing up space), and which Bitcoin Core developer Nicolas Dorier tells Cryptonews.com increases Bitcoin's maximum capacity further.""This is more or less 720,000 a day maximum, assuming 100% SegWit adoption which is not the case yet,"" he says.And Dorier adds that, because of transaction batching, ""it is possible to send to multiple parties with one transaction for effectively the same space. So as a top-of-my-head number, it would be more around 900,000 payments a day.""In other words, given the current state of Bitcoin, the maximum number of transactions that could now be processed in a single 24 hours is roughly 900,000. As impressive as this might be for a still-experimental technology, this isn't anywhere near sufficient for the cryptocurrency to be adopted and used on anything like a large scale.There's also another issue that limits Bitcoin's adoptability. This is its electrical cost and environmental impact, which have already been well-documented by such researchers as PwC's Alex de Vries (aka the Digiconomist).For example, in March, de Vries published a new article, in which he concluded that Bitcoin was responsible for consuming at least 40 TWh of electricity in 2018, equal to Hungary?ôs domestic consumption. Given a daily average of 223,002 transactions per day (worked out using Blockchain.com data for 2018), this would imply that if Bitcoin reached the scale of processing 150 million transactions per day, it would consume roughly 26,900 TWh per year: 200 TWh more than the amount of electricity the entire world consumed in 2018.Of course, it should be pointed out that Bitcoin's energy consumption doesn't increase linearly with the number of transactions it processes. Meanwhile, if Bitcoin is ever updated to make it capable of processing 150 million transactions per day, it's likely that it would also have witnessed changes to its consensus mechanism and energy requirements.Still, this calculation underlines the difficulty of preparing Bitcoin for mass use, while Alex de Vries himself tells Cryptonews.com that, even if there isn?ôt a direct relationship, power consumption will rise with transaction volumes.""Historically, power use has been growing faster than transaction volumes (significantly increasing the energy footprint per transaction in the meanwhile), so it certainly has the potential to escalate fast,"" he says. ""Note that the underlying Bitcoin markets remain very illiquid to date, so you don't need much inflow for a relatively big increase in market value (the primary driver for electricity consumption).""Despite Bitcoin?ôs current limitations, there are signs that it will be able to accommodate mass adoption in the future. Bitcoin Core developers are working constantly on improvements to its inner workings, with one of the most prominent of these being Schnorr signatures, which aggregates multiple transaction signatures into one.""If fully adopted, we will benefit from a roughly 25% size reduction of transactions,"" says Nicolas Dorier. ""However, signature aggregation has an interesting incentive because it rewards transaction batching more heavily,??he adds, pointing out that batching transactions together would further increase capacity.On top of this, there's the Lightning Network, which while still very much in the ?òtesting phase??has the potential to increase Bitcoin's capacity by a wide margin.""If the Lightning Network spreads out, the question of transaction count will not be very important, as it makes it possible to deliver an infinite number of payments with one transaction,"" says Dorier. ""The transaction count will only be important as a limit on the number of lightning channels which can be created or closed in a day, but I don't think this will be a problem anytime soon, even in the next 10 years.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ethereum followed bitcoin and jumped above the key USD 170 resistance area to move into a bullish zone. More importantly, there was a strong upward move in ripple price above the USD 0.335 and USD 0.340 resistance levels.","Total market capitalization After a successful close above USD 5,100, bitcoin price  extended gains above the USD 5,150 and USD 5,200 resistance levels. BTC even broke the USD 5,220 resistance level and spiked above the USD 5,250 level. At the moment, the price is consolidating gains near USD 5,240 and it may continue to climb towards the USD 5,280 and USD 5,300 resistance levels.
The next main resistance is at USD 5,320, above which the price may revisit USD 5,400. On the downside, an initial support is at USD 5,200, below which the price is likely to find a strong support at USD 5,150.Ethereum price  remained well bid above the USD 163 and USD 165 support levels. As a result, ETH climbed above the USD 170 resistance level and moved into a positive zone.
The price is up more than 3.5% to USD 172, with an immediate resistance near the USD 175 level. The next key resistance is at USD 180, where sellers may emerge. On the downside, the key supports are USD 170 and USD 168.Bitcoin cash price  mostly consolidated gains near the USD 310 level. BCH/USD seems to be facing a strong resistance near the USD 315 and USD 320 levels. On the downside, the main support is at USD 300, below which the price could slide to USD 285.
EOS  slowly moved higher towards the USD 5.50 resistance levels. To gain strength, buyers need a follow through above the USD 5.50 and USD 5.55 resistance levels. The next key barrier is near the USD 5.80 level.
Ripple price  is up more than 6% and performed well after there was a break above the USD 0.332 resistance. XRP/USD even broke the USD 0.340 resistance and it may continue to climb towards the next hurdle at USD 0.345. On the downside, there is a strong support formed near USD 0.332.The past few hours saw a strong rise and many small cap altcoins gained more than 8%, including REP, XTZ, BAT, MKR, KMD, SBV and AOA. Out of these, REP and XTZ are up close to 13%.The overall price action is super positive and suggests more gains in bitcoin above the USD 5,250 and USD 5,300 resistance levels. Similarly, there could be more upsides in ETH, XRP, BCH, EOS, TRX, ADA, LTC and other altcoins as long BTC keeps grinding higher.

","The overall sentiment in the cryptocurrency market is recovering this week with a score of 5.1 for the top 10 coins by market capitalization, compared to last week?ôs 4.84, according to Omenics (previously - Predicoin,) a crypto market sentiment analysis service. However, out of those, only Bitcoin is not in the neutral range, having broken its 2019 high of 7.2 with a score of 7.3.","And with Bitcoin?ôs spot at the very top - for at least the twelfth consecutive week - the number of coins in the somewhat positive zone ends. Out of the remaining nine, four are at or above the halfway point and five are below, and none are brushing too close to the positive and negative zones. Litecoin has the second best score with 5.6, while the worst score belongs to Stellar with 4.4. Sentiment change among the top 10 coins*:
Interpreting the SentScore?ôs scale:
- 0 to 2.5: very negative
- 2 to 4: somewhat negative zone
- 4 to 6: Neutral zone
- 6 to 7.5: somewhat positive zone
- 7.5 to 10: very positiveThis is still a significant improvement compared to last week, when only three coins stood at the halfway mark of 5, and six were below. Only XRP and Binance Coin dropped (from 4.6 to 4.5, and from 4.9 to 4.5, respectively), and EOS remained the same with a score of 5, while the others increased their respective scores. Binance Coin?ôs overall drop can, at least in part, safely be attributed to the Binance hack that marked last week.This is also the most likely reason why the biggest weekly drop belongs to Binance Coin, at 18%. Only its buzz factor is above the halfway point, at 5.8, while technical and fundamental factors are in the somewhat negative range at 3.9 and 3.8 respectively.The biggest winner of the week, meanwhile, is Bitcoin with +5.2% to its score. Its fundamentals got the highest score at 8.4, while the lowest belongs to social at 4.9. Pierre-Alexandre Picard, co-founder of Omenics, explains that this is due to the Binance hack and the subsequent reorg discussion. The high scores can, of course, be attributed to the BTC price jump this weekend.Bitcoin SentScore:Even when taking into account the other 20 coins that Omenics tracks, Bitcoin still has the highest score, followed by Litecoin. Only one token is below the neutral zone - in the slightly negative zone - and that is Augur (REP) with a score of 3.8. Its price is struggling similarly in the past few days, having dropped 2.55% in the past 24 hours as of the time of writing, while most of the rest of the market is in green.___

______","In the world of crypto, news and rumors are rampant but facts are few. This is especially true about supposedly imminent government actions that can make or break investor fortunes.Case in point: The news that?ôs been flying across the internet that the Chinese government is going to ban Bitcoin mining.Some widely followed bloggers give readers the impression that the ban is a sure thing. Truth be told, it?ôs strictly a proposal under review.Chinese miners have seen the handwriting on the wall ever since Beijing imposed a trading ban in the second half of 2017.Even back then, many miners in China figured they could be next in the government?ôs crosshairs. So, any large China-based mining company should have contingency plans in place to move their operations to friendlier jurisdictions.Nowhere within the Bitcoin protocol does it stipulate that Chinese miners must have a presence in mining BTC.Nor is the network reliant on any single entity securing the network via Proof of Work.Quite to the contrary, Bitcoin was conceived as an open-ended system where anyone with the resources to act as a validator can do so.Thus, even if Chinese miners must shut down, they?ôll be promptly replaced by others. Moreover, the reduced competition will make mining Bitcoin more profitable for those who remain in the game.A common gripe about Bitcoin is that a small number of miners in China control most of the world?ôs hashrate (the mining ?úresource??, something that could threaten the decentralization BTC is known for.If others have a better chance to compete with the mining giants in China, that could help enhance Bitcoin?ôs decentralization.Veteran miners have become inured to shocks, the largest of which was the 85% decline in Bitcoin prices. A ban on mining by Beijing would be small by comparison.Moreover, as we explain in our 23-page report that has been so widely acclaimed in recent days, we now have...First, leading cryptocurrencies have enjoyed a major improvement in adoption, especially in terms of their on-chain transactions. On average, their transaction volume has more than tripled in the last year or so.Second, these improvements have been driven by transformational upgrades in industry?ôs dominant technologies, especially the shift from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake. Granted, these upgrades come with trade-offs. But overall the industry is evolving rapidly.And third, as we revealed these trends in our report, few people were aware of these positive trends, and most investors are still in the dark. So although crypto prices have rallied this month, they are still extremely low overall.The combination gives investors the best of both worlds ??vastly improved fundamentals PLUS an extremely low cost of entry at the same time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Finally, it struggled to retain momentum and started a downside correction. It recently broke the USD 5,700 support and it seems like the price may test the USD 5,550 support level in the near term. Similarly, ethereum price moved down and revisited the key USD 160 support level. On the other hand, ripple price moved into a bearish zone, with a close below the USD 0.302 and USD 0.300 support levels in the near term.","Total market capitalization After starting a downside correction, bitcoin price  traded below the key USD 5,720 and USD 5,700 support levels. BTC/USD is currently (08:10 UTC) testing USD 5,650 and it seems like it could extend correction in the near term. An immediate support is at USD 5,600, below which the price could test the USD 5,550 weekly support level.
On the upside, the recent supports near USD 5,700 and USD 5,720 are likely to act as hurdles in the near term. A close back above the USD 5,750 weekly resistance may start a fresh increase to USD 5,850 and USD 6,000.Ethereum price  failed to climb above the main USD 170 weekly resistance and declined recently. ETH/USD broke the USD 165 support and recently tested the key USD 160 weekly support. 
If there is a downside break below the USD 160 support, the price is likely to decline below the USD 158 and USD 155 support. The next major support is close to USD 150.Bitcoin cash price  trimmed most its gains and traded below USD 290. BCH/USD even broke the USD 285 support and it is currently down around 3.5%. If the price continues to move down, it could test the main weekly support near the USD 270 level. On the upside, the USD 295 and USD 300 levels are likely to act as a crucial barrier.
EOS  is down more than 4% and it recently broke the USD 4.85 and USD 4.80 support levels. The price even broke the USD 4.70 support and it seems like it could test the main support near the USD 4.55 and USD 4.50 levels in the near term.
Ripple price  is under a lot of pressure and it recently broke the USD 0.302 and USD 0.300 support levels. XRP/USD is down 2% and it is trading below the USD 0.298 level. On the downside, the next key supports are near USD 0.290 and USD 0.285.In the past three sessions, many small cap altcoins corrected lower and declined more than 5%, including MXM, DGD, ATOM, PAI, SC, MCO, LTC, NEO, XEM, ONT, BAT, MONA, MIOTA and ICX. Out of these, MXM is down around 20% and DGD declined nearly 14%.
Overall, it seems like bitcoin price started a major downside correction. BTC could extend losses in the short term, but the USD 5,550 or USD 5,480 levels are likely to act as strong supports in the near term.

April 08, 2019
","With the price of cryptocurrencies recently rallying, they?ôre also gaining more traction, and many more people are making transactions and thus spending transaction fees. Of course, due to the law of supply and demand, transaction fees get more expensive - but there are ways that you can make sure that you don?ôt overpay them, especially if you?ôre not in that much of a hurry.","Transaction fees are included with your bitcoin transaction in order to have your transactions processed by a miner and confirmed by the Bitcoin network. Simply put, they?ôre payment to the miner for including your transaction into a block. Since there is only 1 MB of space for transactions within a single block, the more you are willing to pay - and thus outbid other users - the more likely you are to have your transaction picked up by a miner. Of course, this means that there is a competition among users of the network to make sure their transactions are going through as soon as possible, even if it means overpaying. Bit Consultants, a Bitcoin education and consultancy organization, suggests that users are needlessly overpaying - more than would be strictly necessary to have your transaction included in the next block.However, you could be overpaying for transactions even if you?ôre not doing it on purpose: wallet developers are often incentivized to make their users pay the highest transaction fees in order to evade customers complaining about their transactions not going through.Fee calculations are horrible. Electrum suggesting 90 sat/byte with an almost empty mempool. So many people paying too much on fees. pic.twitter.com/0GSsyQuzIXMost cryptocurrency wallets have the option of adjusting the fee when sending a transaction, but there is a drawback: you risk having to wait longer for your transaction to be included in a block. ?úSpenders willing to wait a bit longer can still save money,??Bitcoin Optech, an organization that helps Bitcoin users and businesses integrate scaling technologies, wrote in a recent newsletter, adding, ?úFor example, as of this writing [April 2nd], Bitcoin Core?ôs fee estimator suggests a fee of 0.00059060 BTC [USD 2.9] per 1,000 vbytes confirmation within 2 blocks but only 0.00002120 [USD 0.1] for confirmation within 50 blocks - saving over 95% for waiting up to an extra 8 hours.?ùHowever, the fee estimator still adds that, ?úBecause of the decentralized nature of the Bitcoin network and the fact that there is sometimes congestion in the available block space (because of the 1 MB limit), the amounts shown here are probabilistic and there are no guarantees that they will work.?ùAll of these transactions are overpaying fees. Even at these levels next block fee is only 0.00003100 BTC ($0.15).Fees aren't high, the fee estimators are...1. Use wallets with custom fees, RBF, and CPFP2. Manually check mempool before each tx3. Optimize for next block. pic.twitter.com/axbUGbovwOBit Consultants offers a simple solution: use wallets where you can set a manual fee amount, that support Replace-by-Fee (RBF) and Child Pays for Parent (CPFP) features. Replace-by-Fee is the replacement of an existing, unconfirmed transaction with a new one, identical except for the fee, which is usually higher to boost the chance of it being confirmed soon for when you can?ôt wait any longer. Child Pays for Parent (CPFP) is a feature which allows the receiver of a transaction to spend the unconfirmed funds they are expecting. The reason this is helpful is because if you are waiting on a transaction that is stuck because the transaction fees are too low, you can simply send the unconfirmed funds to a different wallet address, with a higher transaction fee. The higher fee will have miners pick up the new transaction and the old as well, and both will be confirmed within the same block. If you?ôre more tech savvy, Bit Consultants also recommends checking the mempool by yourself. The size of the mempool is the aggregate size of transactions waiting to be confirmed. If it does not have a very big backlog, there is simply no reason for you to pay more than the minimum - your transaction will get picked up simply because there are not enough other transactions to gain precedence.Mempool size:",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If an investor has done their own research, understands the risks, believes in the system design, watches the fundamentals, and has a low time preference, they stand a chance to be rewarded handsomely. This doesn?ôt have to be accomplished over night either,"" he wrote in a newsletter, adding that bitcoin?ôs recent move has brought back a level of excitement that the market hasn?ôt seen in over a year.George McDonaugh, CEO of KR1, a listed cryptocurrency and blockchain investment company, reiterated that moving away from a specific catalyst or event, lately there's definitely been positive sentiment in the market these last few weeks.""There's a sense that perhaps we've reached the lows for this cycle and it's onwards and upwards from here on in. I think it's still too early to call it, but it seems that that hasn't stopped a few eager buyers jumping the starting gun,"" he said in an emailed statement.Meanwhile, advisory firm Fundstrat Global Advisors claims that the worst is behind for crypto and ""sceptics are on the wrong side of history."" ""We see fewer reasons to question the recent recovery Bitcoin prices?îthe best quarter since 2017.

The fact that there was USD 415 million worth in short positions on the Bitmex exchange may have been too succulent a target for the market not to move against. There have also been rumours about buying bots going awol after some fake news about an ETF [exchange-traded fund] green light from the SEC [the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission] was released as part of an April fools joke. You literally can't make this stuff up. I'd veer towards the first explanation than the second, going by the fact the ETF rumour came out a full 24hrs after the rally began,"" McDonaugh said.Mati Greenspan, senior analyst at social trading platform eToro, suggested in a tweet that ""judging by the timing, it looks like the pump originated in Japan or South Korea."" While his followers are also pointing at China, the Middle East and India.""The economy is slowing down fast in South Korea and Japan, and the stock market is stagnant, so people are prepared to give crypto a second chance,"" according to our correspondent in South Korea Tim Alper. Also, the fact that South Korean and Japanese giants such as Samsung, Hyundai, Kakao, Rakuten, SBI and many Japanese banks are starting to invest a lot of money into their crypto operations, is creating optimism among buyers and investors, he added.Greenspan also stressed that ""it doesn't seem like too many people are selling the pop.""Bitcoin shorts @bitfinex (blue line) near their lowest levels since February.

","In what was a baffling move to many cryptofans, Craig Wright, who claims to be Satoshi Nakamoto, creator of Bitcoin, has filed registrations with the U.S. Copyright Office and has been granted U.S. copyright registrations yesterday for the original Bitcoin white paper and Bitcoin code (version 0.1).","What this essentially means is that these registrations, ?úBitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System??and ?úBitcoin,??recognize Wright, under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, as the author of the white paper and code. What it does not mean, however, is that this type of registration indicates either ownership or official patent. According to the U.S. Copyright Office, Computer code and white papers can be copyrighted as long as they are considered literary works. The office just registers a person as an author of a work, but does not investigate its accuracy.In either case, Bitcoin SV (BSV), the Bitcoin Cash fork backed by Wright, doubled in value following the news, before correcting lower. At pixel time (15:33 UTC), it trades at USD 104, or 69% more than 24 hours ago. Jerry Brito, executive director at Coin Center, a crypto-focused  research and advocacy center, and Emin G√ºn Sirer, professor at Cornell University and founder and CEO at blockchain startup Ava Labs, discuss this further in their respective tweets.Registering a copyright is just filing a form. The Copyright Office does not investigate the validity of the claim; they just register it. Unfortunately there is no official way to challenge a registration. If there are competing claims, the Office will just register all of them. https://t.co/YA70ALpG1YThe distinction between ""Copyright office recognizes person X as author"" versus ""Copyright office witnesses that person X is claiming to be the author"" is subtle. If someone doesn't understand the law, they'll get confused.?úIn the future, Wright intends to assign the copyright registrations to Bitcoin Association to hold for the benefit of the Bitcoin ecosystem. Bitcoin Association is a global industry organization for Bitcoin businesses. It supports BSV and owns the Bitcoin SV client software,??according to a press release from Wright.There have been numerous debates about who stands behind the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, and once Wright began claiming it was him, skeptics nicknamed him ?òFaketoshi??as he failed to provide any proof of this. Given such heated discussions, people reacted quickly to this news as well, and some have even given finding the true Satoshi another try.sadly didn't find anything. It won't matter because I'd put the odds of a successful faketoshi copyright lawsuit at 0%. Still its fun to dig through Bitcoin history.Others, like John McAfee, a crypto advocate and founder of software company McAfee Associates, and attorney Michael Sevarino, seem to find the whole situation rather silly. Damn!!! My lawnmower mechanic was going to file a copyright for the same paper next week. I told him he should have acted sooner. pic.twitter.com/SeTarGauD4Trademark is similar. That?ôs why I laugh when people act like registering a trademark is like registering a patent and they need to do it early and take it really seriously...He continues to use the media to run his cons targetting specific individuals (not wide audiences)...and people making a lot of publicity for him are helping him out.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

","The recent pump of the Bitcoin SV (BSV) price comes as a reminder of the importance of the Chinese investors in the cryptoverse, even if crypto exchanges are banned in the country with population of more than 1.38 billion people.","The price of Bitcoin SV, the infamous hard fork of Bitcoin Cash, almost doubled in the past 24 hours, raising by 90%, to USD 221 (05:14 UTC), and pushing the coin back among the top 10 coins by market capitalization. BSV is now ranked as the 8th largest coin by market capitalization.BSV price chart:According to Dovey Wan, a founding partner of California-based investment company Primitive Ventures, the pump started around the same time as fake news began circulating in China, claiming that Craig Wright, one of the main supporters of BSV, proved that he's the creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, while major exchange Binance will list BSV again. The claims were debunked by Binance CEO, Changpeng Zhao himself. ""I got pinged 20 times today, clarifying it is fake,"" he tweeted.Craig Wright is often dubbed Faketoshi due to his claim that he is Satoshi Nakamoto and general lack of any sort of proof. Binance delisted BSV in April 2019.Earlier in May, BSV also jumped sharply after Craig Wright said he filed registrations with the U.S. Copyright Office and has been granted U.S. copyright registrations yesterday for the original Bitcoin white paper and Bitcoin code. However, this type of registration does not indicate ownership or official patent. Meanwhile, according to Wan, ""completely fake news"" were ""real enough"" to trick many Chinese retail investors. The trick is easy and constantly used by many scams - all chinese  crypto media circulate the breaking news via picture as above in wechat, instead of news link. So anybody can just use the same theme template and photoshop one ?ùüè?like above""Chinese retail is the best herd ever,"" she added.Due to the crypto exchange ban, local investors are using VPNs (virtual private networks) that help bypass restrictions, while the over-the-counter (OTC) market is another popular option.""There are thousands of telegram [a messaging app] users on the Chinese channels of most exchanges as an example,"" a Reddit user claiming to be from China said.At pixel time, Asia-based exchanges such us Upbit, OKEx and Huobi are responsible for 48% of the BSV trading volume in the past 24 hours (USD 1,9 billion in total, or almost 10% of the bitcoin trading volume).Also, as reported, Chinese crypto investors might prompt another ""epic bull market"" in case of a sudden and sharp yuan depreciation.?úChinese asset holders are not stupid. They see the writing on the wall, and as the CNY has recently crept higher towards the magical 7.00 [yuan per U.S. dollar], Bitcoin exited the doldrums and more than doubled,??according to Arthur Hayes, co-founder & CEO of cryptocurrency trading platform BitMEX.Meanwhile, Eric Meltzer, another founding partner of Primitive Ventures, shared his recent experience in China.Back in Beijing for a few days.

However, his words should be taken with a grain of salt as Multicoin Capital is a well known investor in Binance Coin, the native token of competing major crypto exchange Binance.Also, a Twitter user going by the handle @RydesaurusRex gave a breakdown of the situation in which some are investing a lot of money into BTC on Bitfinex in order to get out of USDT, while others supposedly plan to participate in a rumored initial exchange offering to help Bitfinex raise a billion dollars.   One group of investors is pouring money into BTC on Bitfinex to get out of USDT, and another is lining up to participate in an IEO to help them raise a billion dollars.

Out of the examples Dennean gives in his note, all the asset classes (stocks, oil) collapsed by more than 75% from their peaks, except for one, but including Bitcoin, while only two recovered to previous levels.It is not easy to estimate how long it will take for Bitcoin to retrace its all-time highs, but presumably it will not be any time soon, according to Dennean: ?úWe're struck by how long it took other asset bubbles to recover their peak levels (as long as 22 years for the Dow Jones Industrials) and how pedestrian the annualized returns from trough to recovery often are.??Decades later, some asset classes have still not recovered, the report said.Meanwhile, the crypto-Twitter has reacted enthusiastically to this news, not doubting Bitcoin?ôs recovering abilities, claiming that the analyst ""will be humbled"", according to Twitter user @mBTCPizpie.

","At current prices, the average miner is highly profitable again, with even older gear and high-cost producers currently able to make profit, crypto investment firm CoinShares concluded in its newest report on Bitcoin mining. It also claims that China still dominates both the mining hardware manufacturing sector and mining itself, despite being in a grey area. ","According to the report, due to the assumed  cooling  and  overhead  costs, since  November,  ""the  market-average,  all-in marginal  cost of creation,  at ¬¢5/KWh, and 18-month depreciation schedules has decreased from about USD 6,800 to about USD 5,600.""  Moreover, some miners are even able to mine Bitcoin at less than USD 3,500/btc, the researchers at CoinShares said. At pixel time, bitcoin prices stands at USD 7,720. However, as previously reported, as bitcoin price jumped by 61% in May and competition among miners increased, Bitcoin mining difficulty reached its new all-time high, making it more difficult for miners to win the precious reward of BTC 12.5.Meanwhile, the authors of the report calculated that at current (31 May 2019) prices and 30d average fees per block, Bitcoin miners are earning an estimated total annualized return of USD 6.2 billion per year, 94% of which come from new coins and 6% from fees. Over the course of 2018, fees brought 3% of the total revenue. It is ""certainly a welcome development for miners, particularly considering the upcoming halving of the block reward, now less than a year away."" The Bitcoin mining block reward, BTC 12.5 per block will be cut by 50% in a year. It is estimated that this will be the last halving to have a very significant impact on bitcoin price. Furthermore, the authors estimate that China conducts 60% of global mining, with the Sichuan province alone producing 50% of global hashrate, or computing power of the Bitcoin network. ""It is important to note that Chinese miners already operate in a legal grey area, with large differences in treatment between local jurisdictions, and that concrete, large-scale coordinated action on the ground would likely be required to effectively uproot miners,"" the researchers said, stressing that ""certain local governments seemingly much more inclined to view the industry positively due to its vigorous revenue generation on municipal levels.""When it comes to the other 40% of mining, Washington, New York, British Columbia, Alberta, Quebec, Newfoundland and Labrador, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Georgia, and Iran produce 35% of global hashrate evenly. ?úThe remaining 5% is assumed to be distributed widely enough that the global average energy mix is a good enough fit to estimate their energy sources?? it stands in the report.Bitcoin hashrate chart:Also, CoinShares confirmed their previous findings that the Bitcoin mining industry is heavily renewables-driven. ""Our current approximate percentage of renewable power generation in the Bitcoin mining energy mix stands at 74.1%, more than four times the global average,"" the researches said adding that it's almost 4 percentage points lower than in November 2018, which reflecting the upstart of major mining clusters in fossil-dependent regions such as Iran as well as relocation away from hydro-dependent regions such as Oregon.?úPower is the single complexity of the mining ecosystem that can be controlled or confined. You may not be  able  to  control  hashrate,  price,  or  hardware  costs/specs,  but  locking  yourself  into  an  advantageous electricity contract will allow for flexibility and profitability,??wrote Amanda Fabiano, Senior Program Manager at Fidelity?ôs Center for Applied Technology, in the foreword of the report.The report authors, however, have stressed that the Bitcoin mining industry is still a highly private and secretive one and their estimates ""may be subject to significant potential uncertainty."" In either case, the report concludes that Bitcoin mining tends to cluster around comparatively under-utilized renewables infrastructure: ""This could help turn loss making renewables projects profitable and in time?îas the industry matures and settles as permanent in the public eye?îcould act as a driver of new renewables developments in locations that were previously uneconomical.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Wall Street Journal says SoftBank Group founder Masayoshi Son bought BTC at what later proved to be the top of the market in 2017 and sold his holdings after the price crash of early 2018.SoftBank is a major Japanese financial company, and is also the majority stakeholder in Yahoo Japan. The latter owns a 40% stake in the FSA-licensed BitARG platform, and plans to launch a Yahoo Japan-branded exchange in the near future.SoftBank has made a number of blockchain investments, including funding for an Indonesian incubator project. The group also wants to create a blockchain-powered remittance service for its banking arm.Meanwhile, Reuters reported on Tuesday that the Financial Services Agency (FSA) ??the regulator charged with policing Japanese exchanges ??has raided the offices of Huobi Japan and Fisco(FCCE) following management changes at both exchanges. Reuters says ?útwo sources familiar with the matter??confirmed that the FSA wants to look at the way the exchanges are dealing with ?úcustomer protection and anti-money laundering measures.??The FSA is also allegedly keen to ensure ?úlegal compliance after management changes.?ùBoth operators were involved in takeover activities last year. Huobi took over BitTrade, renaming the exchange Huobi Japan. Fisco, meanwhile, bought out the rival Zaif platform following a crippling Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash and Monacoin hack that brought the latter to its knees in September last year. Fisco is planning to merge its operations with Zaif later this year, but in the meanwhile, the latter has continued to do business, although a number of services remain suspended on the platform.There was some good news for Zaif yesterday, however, as the company resumed trading in Monacoin for the first time since the attack ??just over a month after it resumed Bitcoin Cash trading.Elsewhere, rival exchange BitPoint has become the latest to announce it will not be issuing its Bitcoin Cash customers the Bitcoin SV tokens generated by last year?ôs hard fork. Last week, Cryptonews.com reported that SBI Virtual Currencies was adopting a similar policy toward Bitcoin SV after it decided to delist Bitcoin Cash.BitPoint says it will instead convert all customer Bitcoin SV tokens into yen on Friday this week, at a rate of 6,166 yen to 1 Bitcoin SV.

The price is currently consolidating near the USD 5,200 level, with supports on the downside near USD 5,150 and USD 5,110.
On the upside, the USD 5,280 and USD 5,300 levels are strong hurdles for buyers. A proper close above USD 5,300 is likely to open the doors for a push towards the USD 5,450 weekly resistance. The main weekly support is seen near the USD 5,000 level.Ethereum price  jumped back above the USD 170 resistance after testing the USD 160 support area. ETH even surpassed the USD 180 and USD 182 resistance levels and it is currently consolidating gains.
An initial support is near the USD 176 level, below which the price could test the main weekly support at USD 170. On the upside, a break above the USD 185 level might call for a test of the USD 195 weekly resistance.Bitcoin cash  corrected lower and recently bounced back above the USD 300 resistance level. BCH/USD is currently trading near USD 305, with support at USD 300 and USD 292. On the upside, the main resistance is at USD 326, above which the price could test the last week√¢?¨‚Ñ¢s swing high at USD 348.
EOS  recovered after testing the USD 5.00 and USD 5.05 support levels. The price traded above the USD 5.30 resistance and it recently tested the USD 5.65 level, where sellers emerged.
Ripple price  made another attempt to settle above the USD 0.370 resistance, but buyers failed to gain bullish momentum. XRP/USD is currently trading near the USD 0.355 support, with the key weekly support sitting near the USD 0.335 level.In the past three sessions, a few small cap altcoins traded higher and gained more than 8%, including VEST, XVG, NANO, WAX, DGTX, CRO, STRAT and ETC. Out of these, VEST rallied close to 60% and XVG is up around 16%.Overall, bitcoin price is trading in a strong uptrend above the USD 5,000 support. However, if BTC continues to struggle near the USD 5,300 resistance area, there could be another downside correction below the USD 5,000 and USD 4,900 support levels this week. On the upside, bullish continuation above USD 5,300 could lead the price towards USD 5,450 and USD 5,520.

May 19, 2019
",One of the earliest cited use cases for bitcoin was international money transfers. Many believed that bitcoin would disrupt the global remittance market like nothing before because of the digital currency?ôs ability to process borderless digital cash transactions in a matter of minutes at a much lower cost than traditional financial services providers. ,"Today, bitcoin transactions still occur in a matter of minutes, but fees may vary. Additionally, bitcoin merchant adoption is next to zero in most emerging markets, which means bitcoin remittances need to be converted into local currency. Moreover, while most money transfer operators (MTOs) and banks still charge excruciatingly high fees for remittances, fintech startups such as World Remit and TransferWise have managed to lower the cost of money transfers across the board. In this analysis, we will compare how bitcoin remittances fare in terms of costs versus Western Union and World Remit when sending money from the United Kingdom to Kenya. Western Union is arguably the largest and most popular money transfer operator with agents in almost every country around the globe. However, Western Union has also made headlines for being one of the most expensive methods of sending money abroad. All-in fees to send money overseas can end up costing over ten percent of the notional sent.WorldRemit is the brainchild of Somali-born entrepreneur Ismail Ahmed who was faced with the high fees of sending money back home using MTOs like Western Union and, as a result, launched his own, low-cost money transfer startup. Today, WorldRemit has become a major player in the highly competitive international money transfer market and stands out with its user-friendly platform and the wide range of remittance options it provides. Bitcoin transactions are arguably the fastest and cheapest method of sending money abroad and it is available to anyone in the world with an Internet connection. However, bitcoin has to be converted into local currency by the recipient, which can add substantially to the all-in fee of the remittance transaction, if there is not enough local bitcoin liquidity. In the infographic below, you can find the results of our comparative analysis, which involved sending GBP 250 from the United Kingdom to a mobile wallet in Kenya this May. According to Western Union?ôs online money transfer platform, it costs GBP 2.90 to send GBP 250 via debit card to a mobile wallet in Kenya. However, you will also need to add the mark up on the mid rate that Western Union adds, which amount to around 1.8% for this specific transaction (actual 129.2991 Kenyan shillings (KES) vs. mid 131.715 KES). The total transaction fee, therefore, equates to around 3% of the transaction (GBP 7.50). A debit card to mobile wallet transfer with WorldRemit costs USD 2.99 and the mid-rate markup equates to 2.69% (actual 128.26031 KES vs. mid 131.715 KES). The total transaction fee, thus, equates to around 3.8% (USD 9.50). Working with the assumption that someone sending bitcoin remittances would be a bitcoin holder, the cost to USD 250 worth of BTC amounts to around GBP 0.30 (depending on the fees you or your wallet sets for the transaction). However, for the recipient to then turn the BTC into Kenyan shillings, he or she would have to go through the LocalBitcoins peer-to-peer platform or a trusted local broker on the WhatsApp messaging app to complete the bitcoin to mobile money transaction. Going directly through a local broker, the cost to convert BTC to MPESA (Kenya?ôs local mobile money) will cost you around 2.5%. Although, this figure can vary depending on the GBP/KES exchange rate and the domestic demand for BTC. The total cost of a bitcoin money transfer will, therefore, amount to around 2.5% (GBP 6.25). As our analysis shows, bitcoin remittances are cheaper than other money transfer options, provided the sender is a bitcoin holder and there is enough local bitcoin liquidity for low-cost conversion into fiat currency. Should the sender be required to purchase bitcoin locally before sending it abroad, however, it would actually end up being cheaper using fiat currency-based online money transfer services because the conversion fees of GBP to BTC and then BTC to KES would end up costing more than Western Union and WorldRemit?ôs services. Will bitcoin eventually take a market share in remittances?The remittance market has been a target for a number of bitcoin startups that believe that digital currency is the future of international money transfers. Bitcoin companies like Abra, BitPesa, BitSpark, and Coins.ph, for example, have been launched to penetrate this multi-billion dollar market. According to the World Bank, the global remittance market was worth an estimated USD 529 billion in 2018, which marks an increase of almost ten percent versus last year. Meanwhile, according to a report by blockchain research company Clovr, out of 707 individuals surveyed, 15.8% have used digital currencies to send money abroad. While bitcoin and other digital currencies are yet to become serious contenders in the international remittance market, the signs are there that cryptocurrencies will take a market share in the remittance market even if it takes longer than bitcoin proponents predicted in the early days of cryptocurrency.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

May 02, 2019
","Grayscale, a cryptocurrency asset management firm, owned by Digital Currency Group (DCG), launched a new pro-bitcoin ad campaign ?òDrop Gold??to somewhat mixed reactions. ","According to Barry Silbert, the founder of DCG and CEO of Grayscale, ?úThe bitcoin vs. gold battle begins??as their new ad will be played on TVs across the US. The Drop Gold campaign essentially presents bitcoin as an alternative to gold investments and is promoting bitcoin investment within Grayscale?ôs Bitcoin Investment Trust (BIT), which started trading in 2015 under GBTC, the stock ticker of BIT. Grayscale explains on their campaign site that ?úit?ôs not that gold is bad. It?ôs just that bitcoin is better.??The ad itself asks the audiences of the digital age why they would invest in gold, which they perceive as a thing of the past, and urges them to think about the weight of gold itself and how difficult it would be dragging it around. Digital currencies, however, the ad claims are the future, they?ôre secure, borderless, weightless, ?úand unlike gold, they actually have utility.??There were positive responses to the announcement of this ad campaign, such as Tuur Demeester, the founding partner at Bitcoin alpha hedge fund, Adamant Capital, tweeting ?úFantastic commercial. Really well done, and guaranteed to spark debate and controversy?? and Thomas Lee, co-founder of Fundstrat Global, a New York-headquartered investment advisory firm, agreeing with: ?úYes. It?ôs great Barry. Get the word out!?ùOthers, however, voiced their disapproval. Twitter user @a_goldfanatic argues that: ?úThat's the stupidist ad for BTC you will ever see. Gold isn't the problem, fiat currencies are.??A software engineer, Alessandro Chacon, claims that ?úRidiculous, the battle is not against gold but against central banks. Any hard currency are good and complementary.?ùTwitter user @Pickle_cRypto raised some questions concerning Chacon?ôs statement, saying: ??It?ôs a lot easier to sell BTC as a SoV [store of value] competitor, for which is ideally placed already, rather than a future money for which it still has many hurdles (custody, fees, speed, privacy)?? and ?úIt?ôs better than gold as the supply will become more inelastic soon and finite unlike gold. It?ôs more portable, divisible, less possible (impossible) to mimick/fake when compared to gold.?ùIn response, Chacon, however, argues that ?úYou can use it as SoV from your fiat (which inherently loses value by design), it makes no sense to use it as a SoV from your gold (which works already as a reliable SoV)?? adding ?úYou miss the most important advantage of gold: it's phisycal. It may take tens of years for bitcoin to prove that it's completely secure. That's why every year it becomes more valuable :). So in my opinion, nothing will be won by a campaign: ""replace gold with btc"".?ùalso both alternative assets that people put money into. and when new investors are considering investing in gold they may compare it to bitcoin. seems asinine to not compare the twoThis is not the first time such ad campaigns were launched to promote cryptocurrencies. Let?ôs remember, in October 2018, eToro, a multi-asset platform which offers both investing in stocks and cryptocurrencies, released what became a viral ad featuring actor Kristian Nairn, aka Hodor from the mega-popular TV series ?òGame of Thrones?? garnering millions of views in a matter of days. Just a couple of weeks later, Ripple, a California-based crypto start-up, released an ad as well, similar to Grayscale's, using a plane as a metaphor for fast, direct, and up-to-date currency transfer and mocking the outdated financial system.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

April 11, 2019
","Cryptocurrency exchange Bittrex was denied a BitLicense in the US state of New York, necessary to do business with parties residing in this state. Now, the question remains: where will the 35,000 New York-based users go next? Five other cryptocurrency exchanges holding the license may also hold the answer.","A BitLicense is the common term used for a business license of cryptocurrency activities, issued by the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYSDFS) under regulations designed for companies. This license is not solely reserved for cryptocurrency exchanges, but all companies dealing with cryptocurrencies - thus, even real-time gross settlement system and remittance network Ripple holds a BitLicense in order to operate in NY. However, in the case of exchanges, holders of the coveted BitLicense currently include Gemini, Coinbase, bitFlyer, itBit and Bitstamp that obtained the license only this week. In theory, any of these may receive a part of digital assets of the 35,000 customers Bittrex has in the state of New York, although they will be hard-pressed to find one with as many pairings as Bittrex has - a total of 345. For example, itBit and bitFlyer only offer Bitcoin and Ethereum, traded either against fiat (USD, EUR, and JPY) or against each other, while Bitstamp has slightly more options but still sticks to the basics: to the aforementioned two, they add XRP, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin. Gemini adds some flavor with Zcash, but does not otherwise differ from these. On Coinbase, you will also find Stellar Lumens, Ethereum Classic, Basic Attention Token, USD Coin, and 0x - but nothing like the assets Bittrex offers, which includes the likes of Grin, Dogecoin, Verge, or Monero, among numerous others.Bittrex was denied the BitLicense, the NYSDFS explains, due to a number of factors that include inadequate compliance. Those include lacking KYC (know your customer) procedures that let users claim obviously false names like Donald Duck, Give me my money, and more obscene ones that the regulator refused to provide an example for. The refusal letter also questions the ?úlevel of authority and effectiveness of the Compliance Officer,??and states that ?úBittrex?ôs current policies and procedures are either non-existent or inadequate.?ùBittrex has disputed these claims, saying that a number of samples - especially in regards to customer due diligence - were taken years ago, and that these issues have been fixed in the meantime. ?úThe letter mentions accounts with names that did not match. There were less than a dozen of these names in total and none of these accounts were ever active and none of these accounts ever made a trade. The fact that these accounts were unable to trade demonstrates the effectiveness of our diligence process, rather than a deficiency as NYDFS alleges,??the company explained. Bittrex had first applied for a BitLicense back in August 2015 and claims to have ?úworked diligently with NYDFS to address their questions and meet their requirements??ever since. However, they were doomed to become the first company to be refused a BitLicense in the past two years, and will now have 14 days to confirm to NYDFS that the exchange has ceased conducting business in New York, as well as 60 days in total to transfer any assets owned by New York residents and wind down completely.This may misfire for other Bittrex customers, regardless of their residence, says securities lawyer and Co-Founder of Arca, a blockchain- and crypto-focused investment advisor Philip Liu. ?úSuggest if you have assets with [Bittrex], you move those assets off-exchange pronto. Even if you aren?ôt a NYS resident, if they have significant ops in NY, they may not be able to process withdrawals in short order since the NYSDFS order is to ?òcease business operations,?ô‚Ä?he tweeted.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

","As the crypto market rallied sharply in the last hours of Sunday (UTC time), bitcoin reached its new high of 2019, altcoins followed the suit and the total market capitalization increased by almost 8% in the past 24 hours.","At pixel time (04:42 UTC), the average price of bitcoin is up by more than 8% and is trading at around USD 8,670.

Top 10 coins by market capitalization:Some smaller capitalization coins are showing even bigger gains in the past 24 hours, with maximine coin jumping by almost 39%. At pixel time, 12 coins from the top 100 are in red.The total market capitalization reached almost USD 270 billion, or a level last seen in August 2018.According to David Tawil, president of crypto hedge fund ProChain Capital, this is still the thawing out from the crypto winter that was. ?úThere still may be another pullback before we get to fundamentals truly taking over and speculators and frauds being expunged,??he told Bloomberg on Monday, stressing the importance of crypto adoption: ""The more merchants that accept crypto encourages more people to adopt it and use it.""The most recent major example of adoption comes from American telco giant AT&T that started accepting crypto payments. Also, as reported, preliminary numbers, based on data gathered from twenty merchant service providers, show that in January 2019 more than BTC 32,300 were spent, or 47% more than in January 2018. However, the USD value of bitcoins received by merchant services in January dropped by 70%.Nic Carter, co-founder of Coin Metrics,  a provider of crypto asset market and network data, has also found more signs of increasing bitcoin adoption (based on the Coin Metrics data):New ATH ?ò± (In addresses holding at least 0.1 BTC) pic.twitter.com/waXAptr40EMeanwhile, Juan Villaverde, leader of the Weiss Cryptocurrency Ratings team, in a recent opinion piece argued that next the bitcoin correction ""will be the best bitcoin buying opportunity since 2015.""However, while many industry players claim that this crypto market rally will be different than the last, investors, especially newcomers, need to be aware of the fact that crypto is still a highly volatile asset class that will likely go through its next boom and bust cycle in the coming years.Peter Brandt, a 40-year veteran of the markets, who correctly predicted the bear market of 2018 and now estimates that Bitcoin might reach USD 50,000 within the next two years, commented on the recent rally:This is the FOMO phase of the advance.

","The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said it needs more time before making a final decision regarding Bitcoin ETF (exchange traded fund) and asked everyone for additional comments. And now the cryptoverse is yet again debating the need for this investment instrument that might bring more institutional investors into the crypto market, but might cause other problems, also.","On Monday, the SEC delayed its decision regarding the VanEck (an ETF provider) Bitcoin ETF application again. The new deadline for the decision is August 19 and it can be delayed until October. If approved, VanEck would be allowed to list the first ETF in the U.S. that is fully backed by ?úphysical??bitcoins in its reserves, which is  believed by many to be a huge catalyst for the price of bitcoin.?úGiven that their [SEC] issues are with the underlying Bitcoin market, not sure why they just don?ôt deny it as opposed to stringing along the crypto faithful with false hope,??according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Eric Balchunas.As delay was expected, many considered this decision as a non-event - bitcoin price even jumped following the announcement before correcting lower. At pixel time (06:07 UTC,) bitcoin trades at USD 7.900 and is down 1.25% in the past 24 hours.In either case, this ""non-event"" has renewed debates about the necessity for an ETF to move the market up.For example, Andy Bromberg, cofounder of CoinList, a token sale platform, says he's not sure Bitcoin ETF matters as much anymore. ?úWe?ôre increasingly seeing that retail brokerages are going to offer bitcoin to their clients. Once you see that, once you see this widespread adoption, you don?ôt necessarily need the ETF anymore,??he told Yahoo Finance. However, economist and trader Alex Kr√ºger argues that the SEC approving a bitcoin ETF ""would be a very big deal and go long ways into legitimizing crypto in the eyes of institutional investors with deep pockets.""Many believe a bitcoin ETF has become irrelevant given how Ameritrade & Etrade will soon be adding crypto capabilities.However, the Van Eck bitcoin ETF targets institutional investors, while Ameritrade and Etrade target retail.ETF = securitiesCrypto spot =/ securitiesMeanwhile, another argument against Bitcoin ETF was made in August 2018 when two prominent figures of the cryptoverse - Andreas Antonopoulos and Nick Szabo - warned that an approved ETF ?úmight cause more problems than it?ôs worth.?ù‚ÄúI think it's a terrible idea. <...> ETFs fundamentally violate the underlying principle of peer-to-peer money, where each user is operating not through custodian, but has a direct control of their money, because they have direct control of their keys.

April 15, 2019
","After a few days of silence that prompted various speculations in the cryptoland, major cryptocurrency exchange Binance confirmed that it will delist Bitcoin SV (BSV) on April 22 at 10:00 UTC. (Updated on 15:05 UTC: Updates throughout the entire text)","Bitcoin SV dropped by almost 9% following the news and is down by 8.54% in the past 24 hours (14:55 UTC.)""At Binance, we periodically review each digital asset we list to ensure that it continues to meet the high level of standard we expect. When a coin or token no longer meets this standard, or the industry changes, we conduct a more in-depth review and potentially delist it,"" Binance said, repeating its usual wording for delisting announcements.According to the exchange, all trade orders will be automatically removed after trading ceases in each respective trading pair. Withdrawals of these coins and tokens from Binance will continue to be supported until July 22.On Binance, Bitcoin SV trades against four stablecoins and Bitcoin. BSV/USDT is the largest market with the USD 3.8 million trading volume in the past 24 hours (0.50% of the total trading volume on the exchange, it's the 33rd largest market on Binance.) Also, compared to other exchanges, Bitcoin SV is now trading less on Binance, dropping from second place by transaction volume with 8.28% on Friday, to 6th place with 6.03% earlier on Monday. BitForex, HitBTC and IDCM were the top 3 Bitcoin SV exchanges (almost 40% of the total BSV trading volume) out of 71.Cryptocurrency trader and analyst Luke Martin (a.k.a. Venture Coinist) suggested that any bets that were on BSV are going to flow into Bitcoin Cash (it's up by almost 17% in the past 24 hours.) ""It's already catching serious bids right now,"" he tweeted, adding that Binance announcing they will delist will probably lead to other exchanges doing the same. ""Like it or not - coins need exchanges to survive,"" he concluded.As reported last Friday, Changpeng Zhao, CEO of Binance, hinted on Twitter that the exchange might delist BSV, currently the 12th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.Meanwhile, on Monday, the CEO said: ""I don't choose sides on technology. We let [the] market do that. I am against fraud, such as lying to be someone. As such, it is my strong opinion that: Craig Wright is fraud.??Craig Wright, often dubbed Faketoshi due to his claim that he is Satoshi Nakamoto and general lack of any sort of proof, is the main backer of BSV, the infamous hard fork of Bitcoin Cash.However, as the company remained silent about the delisting until now, it prompted speculations that Binance and its CEO could be going back on their intent to delist Bitcoin SV.He's not going to delist something that brings him revenue. As long as it's profitable for him to have it listed on Binance it stays there.Mission accomplished:Traffic to Binance  and Twitter likes increased.What a hero!In the past, Binance delisted multiple coins without communicating with their teams prior public announcements.Meanwhile, Anthony Pompliano, co-founder and partner at Morgan Creek Digital, a digital asset management firm, suggested on Friday that ""every exchange should delist BSV simultaneously on May 1st in a sign of solidarity behind the only Bitcoin that ever mattered.""Cryptocurrency wallet BitFi also had their reply to the situation ready - they promised to remove support for Bitcoin SV from the wallet, before ?úremembering??they never offered support for it in the first place.However, cryptocurrency exchange Poloniex even went completely the other way, admittedly a day before most of the fiasco went down, by listing Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV available for margin trading for non-US customers.As reported, Wright served legal papers on the individual behind the Twitter account @Hodlonaut (that is not available now). ""The papers warned that Wright had had enough of Hodlonaut?ôs ?útargeted campaign??to harass and libel Wright with ?úhighly defamatory and abusive tweets,"" reported Coingeek, a website owned by another big proponent of Bitcoin SV, Calvine Ayre. Moreover, Wright reportedly offered USD 5,000 in BSV for information regarding @Hodlonaut?ôs true identity.Meanwhile, the community raised USD 28,000 for the Hodlonaut's legal fund.""This decision [to delist] will certainly be reported to the Maltese regulators as this is surely a case of people in trusted positions abusing that trust and playing God with which token gets the most volume and market access. In essence, market manipulation,"" Ayre said on Monday, the Financial Times reported. According to him, the decision seems to be based on the fact that ""they don?ôt like one scientist that works on the platform"" while Wright ""doesn?ôt own BSV, not does anybody, so this appears to be very unprofessional.""Meanwhile, popular podcast (What Bitcoin Did) host Peter McCormack revealed he was also served with a letter from Wright?ôs lawyers, which accused him of causing ?úserious harm??to Wright?ôs reputation by repeatedly calling him ?úFaketoshi??and ?úa fraud??on Twitter. McCormack replied to the letter with responses such as, ?úI find it difficult to understand how I can affect the reputation of your client; this mistakenly states that he has any reputation left,??and ?úFor reference, if you Google ?òCraig Wright is a fraud,??there are currently 6,330,000 results. While we can allow for a margin of error, where there is smoke, there is usually fire, and here there is enough fire to make Mordor feel like a holiday in Iceland.??But the crowning jewel, according to many in the community, was: ?úIn response to your client requirements, please let him know the following: 1. Ha ha ha ha. / 2. No. / 3. No. / 4. Jog on. / 5. ROFLCopter.?ùReplying to McCormack?ôs response to Wright, Changpeng Zhao wrote, ?úMasterpiece!

","After a major breach of Binance?ôs Bitcoin hot wallets yesterday, which reportedly held 2% of total BTC holdings, and in which the hackers stole more than BTC 7,000 (USD 40 million) and obtained a large number of user API keys, 2FA codes, the crypto community is in an uproar. The whole situation is getting a slew of different reactions, but some aspects of it more than others - like the Bitcoin blockchain reorganization or a number of conspiracy theories that popped up like mushrooms after the rain.","In what the crypto community is already dubbing the worst possible idea, Changpeng Zhao, CEO of Binance, mentioned the possibility of attempting a rollback of all Bitcoin transactions in the past few days. The Bitcoin ledger is immutable, in part due to its decentralized nature, and the implication that any one person - CZ included - could be powerful enough to unite enough miners for such an endeavor is disconcerting to many.As developer and Bitcoin enthusiast Udi Wertheimer points out, not only could miners not coordinate among each other for this, but a great number of them, as well as other users, would be punished by a rollback - and the majority of the users that would see their transactions, possibly huge ones, simply disappear have arguably nothing to do with Binance or its hack, and no incentive to undo it. But the implications of this idea even being uttered are big, and he adds, ?úI?ôd argue it [the rollback] would still be impossible, but the drama could be real and painful. That?ôs why we must learn from this, stay vigilant, and not cut people some slack when making these suggestions in ?òtest runs??like this one.?ùAdam Back, co-founder and CEO of Blockstream, a company famed for its Bitcoin satellite, adds, ?úA Bitcoin reorg is just not happening, and I doubt any Bitcoin industry, miners nor developers considered it either.?ùRead more: Could this rollback happen? And what would it truly mean?Another big aspect is tightly tied to the idea that keeping your funds on an exchange is never a good idea. ?úBeing your own bank??has long been the driving force behind Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies, and only recently, the community proposed a Proof of Keys event that would have users move their funds from exchanges to their own wallets under the slogan ?únot your keys, not your Bitcoin.??The idea is that, since there is no central entity responsible for your funds, should anything happen to them - it is ultimately the owners??fault for being reckless.An important lesson: now you know why certain people want their own altcoin with their own chain that they control (even though they claim it's decentralized). If they make a mistake, they can just bail themselves out.That won't happen with Bitcoin. Honey badger doesn't care.Binance claims that it will use the #SAFU fund (Secure Asset Fund for Users) to cover this incident in full and ""no user funds will be affected."" In July 2018, Binance started to allocate 10% of all trading fees received into SAFU. However, some users were afraid that this could be the driving force behind a significant drop in price for Binance?ôs native Binance Coin (BNB). ?úBNB is liquid enough that if the payoff is in BNB you can swap it for BTC,??argues the official Twitter account of fund manager Crypto Quantamental, while user @fiege_max replies, ??MessariCrypto [a crypto metrics website, Messari] has on-chain transaction volume at USD 4.5m for the day. USD 40m in inorganic selling pressure is bound to result in significant slippage and subsequent price decline.?ùUser @CryptoDonAlt also warns, ?úBNB holders celebrating how Binance is handling this issue while ignoring that a lot of the #SAFU fund consists out of BNB. BNB that might have to be sold for BTC to pay for the hack.

April 05, 2019
","Yesterday, we saw a short term downside correction in bitcoin below the USD 5,000 level. However, BTC/USD found a strong support near USD 4,800 and later moved higher. The price is consolidating near the USD 5,000 level and it seems like there could be more upsides above USD 5,040 and USD 5,080 in the near term. On the other hand, ripple price gained bullish momentum and rallied close to 7%. XRP/USD broke the USD 0.360 level and it is currently (08:10 UTC) trading with a positive bias. Ethereum price also climbed higher and broke the USD 160 and USD 162 resistance levels.","Total market capitalization There was a strong buying interest see near the USD 4,800 level in bitcoin price . BTC remained well bid and the price recently moved above the USD 4,900 and USD 4,950 levels. However, the USD 5,000 level is acting as a resistance. The next key resistance is at USD 5,040, above which the price may rise towards the USD 5,120 level in the near term.
On the downside, an initial support is near the USD 4,920 level. If bulls lose control, there are chances of more losses towards the USD 4,800 support area.Ethereum price  formed a strong support near the USD 154 and USD 155 levels. ETH recovered recently and traded above the USD 160 and USD 162 resistance levels. The next key resistance is at USD 165, above which the price may rise towards the USD 170 level.

BCH/USD declined below USD 300 and it is currently consolidating above the USD 270 and USD 275 resistance levels. A fresh increase above USD 300 is needed for a push towards the USD 325 and USD 330 levels.
EOS  is slowly moving higher after testing the USD 5.00 support level. It is currently trading above the USD 5.25 level, with many resistances near the USD 5.35 and USD 5.40 levels. The main support is now at USD 5.10.
Ripple price  started a strong upward move today and broke the USD 0.350 and USD 0.355 resistance levels. XRP is up more than 6% and it may continue to rise towards the USD 0.375 and USD 0.388 resistance levels. The main stop for buyers could be USD 0.400.In the past three sessions, a few small cap altcoins climbed higher and gained more than 8%, including MXM, NPXS, XIN, PAI, QBIT, THETA, CRO and ENJ. Out of these, MXM is up more than 60% and NPXS gained nearly 17%.Overall, bitcoin price seems to be consolidating gains above the USD 4,900 and USD 4,800 support levels. To start a fresh increase, a proper close above the USD 5,000 and USD 5,040 levels is required. On the other hand, a break below the USD 4,800 support might extend correction towards the USD 4,650 level.

May 23, 2019
","Erik Finman, the twenty-year-old crypto millionaire and one of the earliest and youngest investors in Bitcoin, is launching a new Bitcoin investment app called CoinBits. This tool uses an investment strategy known as dollar-cost averaging, applying it to Bitcoin investing. The website states that investing in Ethereum and Litecoin will be available soon as well.","CoinBits, which was available for public testing for some time now, allows users to round up their daily purchases to the nearest dollar and automatically invest the weekly total spare change in fractions of a Bitcoin. ?úIf your round-ups do not meet our weekly USD 5 minimum, we will still debit your account the minimum amount so you don't miss a week of dollar-cost averaging?? the website states.What Finman hopes to accomplish with this app is the simplification of the investing process for people who are just entering the cryptoworld and might find it intimidating. ?úI?ôm focusing all my efforts on solving that main problem first of that it?ôs too hard to get into?? Finman told Cheddar, announcing the launch of the app which is now available to all who are interested. It should be easy to use as ?úit allows you just to sign up, connect your payment information and buy Bitcoin.?ùHe further explains in the interview that users can do a manual investment, or they can set it up so each time they use debit card or credit card, it invests a bit in Bitcoin. That way the application can be ?úrunning in the background, have it on autopilot, set it and forget it.?ùThe website gives a simple example: if you buy fries for USD 1.75, the change of USD 0.25 will automatically be invested in Bitcoin, with no transaction fees. However, users can pause their round-ups and withdraw their money at any time, the site claims. There is also a flat USD 1 same-day ACH (Automated Clearinghouse) processing fee for any transaction made on the app: weekly round-ups, one-time Bitcoin purchases, and cash withdrawals.Also important to note is that, as the FAQ states: ?úYou cannot transfer, trade or withdraw your Bitcoin on CoinBits. You can however convert your Bitcoins into cash and withdraw your money at any time.?ùIn regards to issues Bitcoin is facing, in Finman?ôs opinion, there are four major problems that can be solved, but that might ruin the cryptocurrency in the long run if they aren?ôt. The largest of them is the mentioned existing process which is too complicated and intimidating for new users, making it hard for them to get in. Other three are high transaction fees, low speed, and ?úcultish hierarchies??and infighting. As a reminder, Finman had reportedly dropped out of school to become an entrepreneur, and at the age of 12 used the EUR 1,000 from his grandmother intended for his studies to buy Bitcoins for about EUR 10 each. Now, he's allegedly in possession of about 450 bitcoins, which is worth about USD 3.6 million based on current prices.Just recently, Finman said: ?úI believe that you could be a millionaire by investing in blockchain and bitcoin. [?? if you?ôre not a billionaire in the next 10 years, it?ôs your own fault?? echoing the sentiment he had more than a year ago, despite the bear market that digital currencies went through.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

","Cryptocurrency owners in Japan, beware ??pay your parking fines on time, or the police will take your tokens!","That appears to be the message after police in the Gifu Prefecture seized over USD 3,600 worth of cryptocurrencies from a man who had accrued years??worth of late fees on parking violations dating back to August 2014.Per Reuters Japan and the Okinawa Times, police forces around the country have been looking to take advantage of a new law, introduced last year, which states that cryptocurrencies do have a legal and financial value ??meaning police and courts can be granted the power to seize them. However, this is the first time that the police have made a token seizure of this scale.The man has been described as unemployed, and was residing in Nagoya. Officers say he had repeatedly failed to pay fines for almost half a decade. The police had sent him over a dozen warnings, and paid numerous visits to his house, but eventually concluded that he owned no assets of value besides his cryptocurrency holdings.The move comes just under a year after Hyogo prefectural officers became the first police force in the world to seize tokens for unpaid traffic fines ??taking a much smaller amount of cryptocurrency (around USD 45) from a 55-year-old traffic laws violator.Elsewhere in the country, the head of the Bank of Japan (BoJ) has slammed cryptocurrencies, stating that crypto investment represents mere ?úspeculation.??Governor Haruhiko Kuroda told a parliamentary finance committee on May 9, ?úCryptocurrencies aren?ôt used much for payments and settlements, and are often the target of speculation.?ùKuroda?ôs comments come three months after he told parliamentarians that cryptocurrencies are not legal tender and ?údon?ôt have assets to back up their value,??as reported on at the time by Reuters.Interestingly, on May 8 Mario Draghi, the President of the European Central Bank (ECB), also said ?úcryptocurrencies, or bitcoins, or anything like that??are not currencies, but ?úspeculative assets??that do not have the same stability as the euro.Regardless of the BoJ?ôs stance, however, Japanese banks and its financial sector remain keen on cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. A number of banks in the country have invested heavily in cryptocurrency companies, including exchange platforms.These include the likes of Softbank Group, a financial giant which, per Nikkei, this week announced the sale of its 36.08% stake in Yahoo Japan to its mobile subsidiary SoftBank Corp, which already owns some 12% of Yahoo Japan?ôs shares. The move means the latter will own almost half of Yahoo Japan ??which operates the newly rebranded TaoTao crypto exchange,  a licensed platform that Yahoo Japan bought a 40% stake in last year.Other notable banking firms involved in cryptocurrency in Japan include the likes of the SBI Group, whose chairman recently became a Ripple board member.Meanwhile, some of Japan?ôs biggest commercial banks are planning (or have already moved ahead with) stablecoin launches this year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

","When we think about a war of any sort, trade war included, we don?ôt tend to think about anything remotely positive. Yet, the current US-China trade war, if it spreads into the US bond market, can see China selling-off US Treasuries, which might in turn make certain cryptos soar.","This possibility was presented in an article written by Panos Mourdoukoutas, a columnist, Professor and Chair of the Department of Economics at Long Island University in Brookville, New York, and a contributor to Forbes in which this particular article was published. The article also states that the chances of China making this move are very low as it would devalue the US dollar against the yuan, raising the price on Chinese exports. But what would happen if they do make the move?Mourdoukoutas makes a point that the trade war is shifting from tariffs to technology, which immediately affects digital assets. Bitcoin has gained around 130% since the beginning of the year, but it?ôs not alone, as other major coins are experiencing gain as well.In the last week, BTC saw a rise of 15.11%, ETH 19.92%, XRP 25.6%, and LTC 35.77%. Other major coins in the top 10 list by coin market capitalization have all experienced an increase in the last seven days.And while gold price is almost unchanged compared to the beginning of this year, according to the author, ?úBitcoin is turning into the new gold.??What is happening exactly? Mourdoukoutas explains that what this trade war signals to the worried investors is lack of globalization, so to say, which is vital to them, so they are increasingly ?úseeking shelter in cryptocurrencies.?ùTo go back just a little bit, here is the context as explained by Professor: US Treasuries have served as store of value for years during the uncertain times caused by global geopolitical events, trade wars included. ?úThat?ôs why US Treasuries have also been rising along with Bitcoin as the US-China Trade tensions flared up in recent months?? Countries that have traded surplus with the US would store their excess dollars in the US bond markets. ?úChina has parked over one-trillion in US Treasuries,??Mourdoukoutas says, adding ?úBeijing may begin selling them off if the trade war escalates?? which ?úcould be bullish for competing Treasuries, and for Bitcoin.?ùQuoting Ruggero Gramatica, CEO of startup Yewno, the author explains that, in case the bonds were sold off, that money would go to other Treasury bonds, like German bonds and Japanese government bonds.??Gold still remains as an alternative but with much less return, liquidity, and high carrying costs.Bitcoin, however, could serve as an alternative store of value, which would push their prices up. BTC and other cryptos are ?úarguably a superior store of value due to its durability, limited supply, predictable inflation and ease of transfer?? says Gramatica.Meanwhile, other points have also been raised in the cryptoverse, such as how does the trade war affect mining and new miners.The Trade War literally makes Bitcoin mining in US 25% more expensive, as miners here have to import all machines from China (there are some clumsy workarounds... ) Just FYI how US is in disadvantage when it comes to pretty much all things cryptoMeanwhile, just a while back, Arthur Hayes, co-founder & CEO of cryptocurrency trading platform BitMEX, stated how a sharp and sudden yuan depreciation could lead to the beginning of another epic bull market.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

","After multiple mainstream media outlets reported on the news, not only people rushed to google who this young (almost 29) crypto millionaire is, but were searching for the 'cryptocurrency' term more actively, also. As the graph below shows, Google searches for 'Justin Sun' (the blue line) and 'cryptocurrency' (the red line) jumped following the announcement:The Tron founder confirmed yesterday that he's the winner of the Warren Buffett charity lunch auction on eBay that ended last Friday.

""I want to point out, though, that even one of the most successful investors of all times can sometimes miss a coming wave.

Changpeng Zhao, CEO of major cryptocurrency exchange Binance, confirmed that he was invited, but he ""can't make it. Too far."" While the crypto community suggested that famous Bitcoin educator Andreas M. Antonopoulos, Hester M.

He allegedly used the EUR 1,000 euros from his grandmother intended for his studies and bought bitcoins for about EUR 10 each.

Though some may be quick to dismiss him due to his youth, let?ôs remember that he?ôs already got eight years of experience under his belt.  Finman is a strong proponent of investing in crypto, sticking with it through the bear and the bull market and whatever price swings occur for at least the next decade, believing that that?ôs how anyone can reap the most benefits. He likens the current state of the cryptosphere with the internet in the 1990s ??the very invention that made digital currencies possible ??or major companies like Amazon in their early stages of development, and there is no denying that both have achieved unparalleled success.?úBut the biggest mistake they [people who just recently entered cryptocurrency] can make is to get out of the market now and sell their bitcoins just because of a setback??

","ALGO, the native token of Algorand, a developer of a decentralized digital currency and transactions platform, that was recently listed following its public sale last week, has seen its price crashing in the market following an initial hype.","Despite a seemingly strong team and promising specs, ALGO?ôs price failed to follow through as the coins went into circulation. After an initial pump that brought the price of the coin from USD 2.40 to c. USD 3.30, the price has now fallen by roughly 50% to less than USD 1.70 each (11:41 UTC).According to data from the Algorand Foundation, during the public sale last week, all 25 million tokens were sold at a price of USD 2.40 each, meaning the Foundation managed to raise USD 60 million from the sale.At the same time as the auction, the Algorand MainNet was also launched. This is a network that reportedly can process 1,000 transactions per second, putting it closer to payment networks like VISA, which is said to handle approximately 1,700 transactions per second.Algorand brands itself with a strong focus on decentralization and democratic user participation. It further uses Proof-of-Stake and self-validating transactions instead of the mining-based Proof-of-Work algorithm that Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies use. Algorand was founded by Silvio Micali, an MIT professor and recipient of the Turing Award, an annual prize nicknamed the ?úNobel Prize of computing.?ùAccording to the Algorand Foundation, an additional 600 million ALGOs is to be auctioned off each year, which over time will grow the total supply of ALGOs to 10 billion. Based on the initial valuation of USD 2.40 per coin, that would eventually bring the market cap of ALGO to USD 24 billion, compared to Ethereum?ôs, which is the second largest by market capitalization, current market valuation of USD 32 billion.However, Algorand is facing scrutiny from the crypto community, as industry players such as Jeff Dorman, Chief Investment Officer at Arca, a Los Angeles-based crypto investment management firm, popular cryptocurrency analyst Arjun Balaji and others, question whether the coin?ôs true market capitalization is being correctly reflected. According to them, ALGO is structured so that buyers will be guaranteed to get 90% percent of their money back in a year.Awesome. But before $ALGO twitter goes insane, can we agree that @twobitidiot & @ericturnr will soon have a metric that shows ALGO raised $6mm and not $60mm? ALGO has to keep $54mm in a trust to pay out the inevitable $54mm that is put back to them in 1 yr. Please mkt cap adjust. https://t.co/ILWjOdR4bz(Not involved in any way) Saying they raised $6m is more accurate as they need to hold $54m to cover the 0.90 put.In either case, Algorand has received support from several major exchanges, and is currently available for trading on Binance, Bitfinex, Huobi Global, KuCoin, and several other exchanges.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

","Failed Canadian exchange Quadriga CX was seemingly a fraudulent crypto exchange and does not even ?úprovide any visibility into whether Quadriga was operating profitably or not?? according to the latest report from the QuadrigaCX CCAA (the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act) monitor. And while it claims that the reportedly deceased CEO Gerald Cotten was behind it, it?ôs not yet clear who (if anybody) else was involved and where is the money users lost. ","As a reminder, the CCAA is a Federal Act that enables corporations with financial issues to restructure their affairs, when the company applies to the Court for protection under this Act. Quadriga was granted temporary bankruptcy protection in a Canadian court earlier this year.The assets of Cotten and his wife include real estate, vehicles, aircraft, securities, sailboats, and gold and silver coins, with value of USD 9 million, and the trustee wants to seek recovery and liquidation of the preserved assets for the benefit of creditors and the recovery of Quadriga funds. The report says that ?úthe Monitor has relied upon the information available to it from Quadriga, its independent contractors and other parties with historical involvement with Quadriga?? but states that ?úfunds received from and held by Quadriga on behalf of Users appear to have been used by Quadriga for a number of purposes other than to fund User withdrawals.?ùIt describes the following scheme: Cotten allegedly would set up a fake account, fund it with millions of dollars of both fiat and crypto, neither which exist, then buy real crypto from users and move it off the exchange to ?úcompetitor exchanges into personal accounts controlled by Mr. Cotten.?ùIn the words of the monitor: ?úMr. Cotten created Identified Accounts under aliases where it appears that Unsupported Deposits were deposited and used to trade within the Platform resulting in inflated revenue figures, artificial trades with Users and ultimately the withdrawal of Cryptocurrency deposited by Users and [?? Substantial Funds were transferred to Mr. Cotten personally and other related parties. The Monitor has not located any support justifying these transfers.?ùAs the monitor alleges, ?úpasswords were held by a single individual, Mr. Cotten and it appears that Quadriga failed to ensure adequate safeguard procedures were in place to transfer passwords and other critical operating data to other Quadriga representatives should a critical event materialize (such as the death of key management personnel).??Death did happen and it was impossible for the monitor to verify many of the information or find the missing assets. The exchange was not transparent when it comes to its profitability; it didn?ôt have internal controls or keep accounting records either, and it did not separate customer assets from Quadriga?ôs assets. The report notes ?úthe lack of formal books and records and inability to access certain encrypted devices??At the Filing Date, the report says, approximately 76,000 users were owed a combination of fiat and cryptocurrency by the exchange, including almost USD 5.5 million and close to CAD 67 million, 26,295 BTC, 122,743 Litecoin, 89,924 Ethereum, etc. Total holdings is about USD 162 million, out of which is the equivalent of approximately USD 106 million in crypto and USD 55 million in fiat holdings.
__________________________________________________________________Apparently, in three years between 2016 and 2019, Cotten transferred 9,450 BTC, 387,738 ETH and 239,020 LTC out of Quadriga, but it?ôs not clear if it?ôs from the fake accounts. He used some the crypto as a security for margin trading accounts he himself established on other exchanges. ?úTrading losses incurred and incremental fees charged by exchanges appear to have adversely affected Quadriga?ôs Cryptocurrency reserves.??Some portion of it was returned to Quadriga, but 5.6 bitcoins not returned were transferred to wallets likely owned by Cotten, and 1426.2 bitcoins were moved to wallets of unidentified owners.Cotton had full access to the platform but the system did not record his activities on his demand. ?úUser Account obligations as at the Filing Date indicate Quadriga ought to have held CAD74.1 million and CAD140.5 million of Fiat and Cryptocurrency respectively?? says the report. ?úThe Platform does not report and Quadriga does not track where these Funds, if they do exist, were to have been physically, or in the case of Cryptocurrency, digitally maintained.?ùCotten might have moved the crypto through Quadriga accounts that were under pseudonyms. ?úApproximately 95% of all Identified Account activity was processed through an Account in the name of Chris Markay.??It had USD 166 million of fiat credits and 34,806 BTC and 540,011 ETH in cryto deposits while only 1% of all that was supported by documents as a proof it existed.In regards to the funds recovered so far, the report states: ?úThe Monitor has recovered Fiat totalling CAD 31.5 million from various sources. Subsequent to the bankruptcy date, the Trustee has recovered an additional CAD 0.5 million. The Trustee has identified and is pursuing the recovery of an additional approximately CAD 900,000 from one of the TPPs as a result of its investigation and information obtained pursuant to earlier Orders of this Court?? Furthermore, the Monitor has ?útaken possession of or identified Cryptocurrency valued, in Canadian equivalent dollars as at the Filing Date, at approximately 1.0 million [dollars].?ùMeanwhile, in February, Cryptonews.com reported that many have already suspected that all his might have been a case of mismanagement and an attempt to cover it up.The QuadrigaCX CCAA monitor report was first discovered by Canada-based commercial litigator Evan Thomas.In summary, Quadriga was a fraudulent exchange and insolvent for years. The biggest questions not answered by the report are what happened to hundreds of millions in customer crypto and who besides Cotten participated in this scheme?In either case, as many experts have stressed previously, crypto users should keep their private keys to their coins offline, e.g. in hardware wallets such as Ledger, Trezor, KeepKey and others.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The CEO did not specify how it will change after the update and what other features will be implemented.However, according to Nivi, going forward, the company is planning to release more devices and make new software announcements: ""Software like our operating system MineOS as a standalone [operating system] and apps"". Also, ""services like Compound Finance and Cred that earn you interest on your crypto"" are in the works, the CEO said without specifying. Moreover, the company plans to add support of the Bitcoin Lightning Network in Q3 2019, so their users will be able to send and receive payments and earn routing fees with their bitcoin and use some of the lightning apps.Recently, Coinmine added Grin mining on their device and they're planing to add the HNS coin, the native token of Handshake, an experimental, decentralized peer-to-peer root DNS, and ""a few others this year.""""When we added Grin, a double digits percent of our users started mining it immediately,"" Nivi said, adding that Coinmine will share more data about the company's results over time.Besides Grin, the device can mine Ethereum, Monero and Zcash. A hypothetical calculator on the website of Coinmine shows that after one year of mining with Coinmine One, which retails for USD 799, you might have around USD 230 worth of Ethereum, if its price would be the same as today (USD 240). In the case of Monero, at current prices, you might have c. USD 164 worth of Monero. Meanwhile, if the device is running nonstop for the whole year, it would increase your electricity bill by around USD 200, given that you're paying 12.83 USD cents/kWh, which was the average in the U.S. in March 2019.However, in an article published in February, Nivi argued that ""from an economic perspective, mining can be a much better option for accumulating cryptocurrency than buying.""""With the right framework and models, it can allow people to use their resources to not only acquire cryptos that interest them today, but leave themselves open to new cryptos that should arise in the future,"" he said in an article where he discussed profitability, investment and return on investment in cryptocurrency mining in more detail.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

","Nine American companies are among the world?ôs top 10 blockchain patent acquirers, as big businesses and startups from the United States look to make advances in the technology underpinning most cryptocurrencies.","According to a survey of a total of 11,134 blockchain patents from German IP analyst IPlytics, tech giant IBM is the strongest, measured  by patent family size. (Family patents are essentially patents that have been filed in more than one country. The more countries in which a patent has been  filed, the higher the perceived international market potential for the patented invention.) The company owns a total of 297 patents, 185 of which are family patents. Meanwhile, Blockchain developer nChain, affiliated with one of the main backers of Bitcoin SV, Craig Wright, often dubbed Faketoshi, led the way in terms of individual patents, having filed 443 of them. As a reminder, in May, Wright made headlines with his attempt to copyright the original Bitcoin white paper and Bitcoin code (version 0.1).The lone non-American company making the IPlytics top 10 is the UK?ôs British Telecom (BT) ??formerly a state-owned telecoms provider ??which placed at number 7 in the rankings.
__________________________________________________________________________________Other big companies making the top 10 were Intel, placing at number 2, as well as Accenture, Visa, Mastercard, Microsoft and bank MBNA.The IPlytics figures also reveal that 4,673 blockchain patents were filed in 2018, a figure almost three times as high as 2017?ôs total. And as of April, 2,354 patent filings have already been filed in 2019.The by-country analysis also revealed that Americans dominated proceedings ??coming top with 4,948 applications, with China a distant second, followed by two European countries (Germany and the UK), and South Korea in fifth.Meanwhile, in 2017, out of a total of 406 patents filed, 225 were filed by China, followed by the U.S. with 91 filings, according to the World Intellectual Property Organization. The recent report by the German company was not overly optimistic about the monetization of blockchain. Its authors stated, ?úWe are yet to see where blockchain technology will be applied in the commercial sector. While large corporations such as IBM and Intel have started to build blockchain IP portfolios, most patent ownership is still fragmented.?ùAnd per Herald Kyungjae, the South Korean government?ôs hardline stance on cryptocurrencies may be to blame for the country?ôs less-than-impressive showing in the IPlytics standings.The media outlet quotes an unnamed industry spokesperson as saying, ?úSeoul is promoting blockchain as a growth engine for the economy, but it is difficult for companies to invest heavily in obtaining blockchain patents as they are not permitted to work with cryptocurrencies.?ùAlso, in related news, Mitsubishi Electric and Yaskawa Electric are among 100 major Japanese manufacturers set to share production data with each other to improve efficiency, using blockchain technology to ensure their information remains secure, Nikkei reported today.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

","After independent developers pushed cryptocurrencies closer to giants such as Twitter and Whatsapp, another company just built a bridge towards online retail giant Amazon and is targeting other e-commerce incumbents such as eBay and Ali Express.","Moon, a crypto payment processing startup?ôs service, announced that Coinbase users can shop on Amazon buy paying with Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, and Bitcoin Cash via the Lightning Network technology.""Soon you?ôll be able to shop on any of your favorite e-commerce websites, like eBay, Ali Express and Target,"" the U.S.-based company said on its website.Until now, beta users utilized Moon to pay with crypto on e-commerce sites, and they were able to do so by connecting the browser extension to exchange accounts such as Coinbase. However, thanks to Moon?ôs lightning feature, now any lightning-enabled wallet can be used through Moon?ôs browser extension, the startup explained. The extension?ôs Lightning Network support is pending Chrome Web Store review, it added.The company further stated that there are no fees for purchases made via Moon, that the payments are instant, that all data is encrypted, and that it is not a custodial service. Moon manages payment channels and provides an interface for sending payments. Meanwhile, after installing the extension, users are required to make an account. While making a purchase, they will receive a QR code from the extension, along with the lightning invoice, and they can pay with their lightning wallet of their choice. The extension will recognize the checkout process, and users just need to click ?úPay with Moon??to complete the purchase.Not all e-commerce sites will accept cryptocurrency, which is why, through Moon, users??bitcoin is converted into fiat and then transferred to the sites, though it is still unclear which traditional financial institutions will be doing the actual conversion.Meanwhile, other third parties have also started bringing cryptocurrency closer to other giants. Developer Sergio Abril launched Tippin, a new app for Chrome and Firefox browsers in February 2019, which lets users tip a certain tweet with Bitcoin via the Lightning Network. Furthermore, Wuabit, a Spain-based independent startup, aims to launch a limited public beta of its crypto wallet for the popular messaging app WhatsApp this month, where it will be available through the chat interface, but also for other messaging apps such as Telegram, Facebook Messenger, as well as SMS, as Wuabit co-founder and CEO/CTO Manuel Polo previously told Cryptonews.com.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

","The Financial Action Task Force (FATF), a multi-government body, agreed to implement their previous recommendations that would force governments to tighten oversight of the crypto business. (Updated on 18:04 UTC: updates throughout the entire text.)","Also, countries will be compelled to register and supervise all crypto-related businesses, including hedge funds, exchanges, custodian services, which will have to check their customers and report suspicious transactions. The FATF will monitor implementation of the new requirements by countries and service providers and conduct a 12-month review in June 2020.As reported, cryptoworld has already braced for impact and deemed the recommendations as 'draconian'.Some of the key things from the confirmed FATF recommendations:____""By adopting the standards and guidelines agreed to this week, the FATF will make sure that virtual asset service providers do not operate in the dark shadows. This will enable the emerging FinTech sector to stay one-step ahead of rogue regimes and sympathizers of illicit causes searching for avenues to raise and transfer funds without detection,"" the U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said after the 2019 Orlando Plenary of the Financial Action Task Force on Friday.""In the U.S., I have convened a working group with the Federal Reserve and other regulators to make sure we keep the use of digital assets for legitimate use only,"" he added. Global Digital Finance, an industry body that represents crypto-related companies worldwide, said it welcomed the FATF rules, according to Reuters. However, Teana Baker-Taylor, its executive director, said FATF recommendations to compel firms to include in cryptocurrency transactions details of senders and beneficiaries could be difficult to meet. Meanwhile, Megan Gordon, a partner at Clifford Chance law firm, told Reuters that the rules could spark consolidation in the cryptocurrency sector because of the high cost of implementing anti-money laundering checks for smaller firms.

However, barely a tenth of the respondents believe crypto will be used as a currency in the future. ","The online survey, done through Google Surveys, included a total of 10,000 respondents, evenly spread over 10 European countries: Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain, and the UK. However, the profile of the respondents is unknown and it's not clear how many of the surveyed Europeans own cryptocurrency.In either case, respondents from Norway were the most optimistic ones, with 73% of respondents positive about the future of the industry, while 55% of respondents from France believe the same, putting the country at the bottom of the list. Still, this shows that in all the countries participating in the survey, the majority believes crypto is here to stay.The percentage of consumers who believe cryptocurrencies will still exist in 10 years??time:In what form crypto will exist in a decade remains a mystery to most, as only 8% believe it will become a currency, while only 7% believe it will be used as an investment or security. Only Poles believe crypto might have more of a future as an investment or security than as a currency.The percentage of consumers who believe bitcoin will exist as an investment and security tool in 10 years??time:Although the majority of respondents in each country believes crypto will be around in the future, the same optimism does not apply to Bitcoin itself. Italy is the most optimistic country on the list with 55% of respondents positive about Bitcoin?ôs future, while France is at the bottom with only 40%.

However, the FSA appears not to have yet pushed ahead with proposed plans for initial coin offering (ICO) controls.The government says the move to rename cryptocurrencies as ?úcrypto assets??was made in line with the stance of most G20 nations, who prefer the term ?úasset??to ?úcurrency??when talking about Bitcoin and altcoins.Nikkei also reports that the changes put limits ?úon speculative trading,??and it looks like the laws will now also include clauses pertaining to margin trading, which is considered to be very risky, that fall in line with limits set by the self-governing Japanese Virtual Currency Exchange Association (JVCEA) ??an association comprising all of the country?ôs licensed exchanges. The JVCEA has put a 4:1 cap on margin trading at exchanges.The legal changes also specifically outlaw the manipulation of cryptocurrency markets for the first time, granting the police the power to charge individuals it suspects of attempting to bring about price rises or drops.

","It will take another 12-24 months for the cryptocurrency ecosystem to be ready for institutional money to enter the space, according to Charles Hoskinson, CEO of blockchain consultancy and research firm IOHK that is developing the Cardano platform.","?úThe really smart money is aware that the market is not yet stable and that it is just not at the level of maturity [yet] to support institutional surge,??Hoskinson told Cryptonews.com.He stressed that should institutional investors, such as BlackRock, an American global investment management corporation, allocate 0,5% of their portfolio in cryptocurrencies it would bring billions of dollars into the crypto market.BlackRock ended 2018 with USD 5.98 trillion in assets under management. At the time of writing, crypto market capitalization stands at USD 190 billion.According to Hoskinson, despite regulatory challenges, traditional investors are becoming more comfortable with the crypto ecosystem, while custodial solutions are being figured out, which is necessary for institutional money to enter the space.As reported in May, a survey of more than 400 institutional investors in the U.S. showed that four in ten respondents say they are open to future investments in digital assets over the next five years. Moreover, 22% already have some exposure to these assets.Previously, Hoskinson estimated that it could take 10 years to regain the highs we have witnessed in the crypto market in 2017.  However, he stressed that if he would be good at predicting market movements, he ?úwould be a trader instead of an engineer.?ùIn either case, according to his observations, the crypto market tends to move in spurts. ?úIt [crypto prices] kind of spikes up, dies down and stays flat for a long period of time and then there?ôs another spike. Regardless of when you come in, there is always going to be spikes. So, the dawn of tokens and Ethereum pushed Bitcoin to USD 1,200, the dawn of initial coin offerings pushed Bitcoin to USD 20,000 and created a huge interest. The next spurt will come from institutional money and the dawn of security token offerings (STOs),??Hoskinson said.As reported, the STO market is estimated to grow this year, but at a steady rate - and the explosion might come some time until 2021, according to Carlos Domingo, founder and CEO of security token platform Securitize. As for the main project of IOHK, the Cardano platform recently completed an upgrade dubbed ?òShelley??which is pushing the platform towards its goal of full decentralization. ?úWith the Shelley release, we will move from a federated setting, where all the block producing nodes are run by IOHK, the Cardano Foundation, and Emurgo [a venture fund controlled by IOHK], to a decentralized system where blocks are produced by stake pools. This will be permissionless, in the sense that anyone is free to run a stake pool, and every holder of ADA [the native token of Cardano] can delegate their stake to a stake pool of their choosing,??Philipp Kant PhD, director of formal methods at IOHK, told Cryptonews.com. According to Hoskinson the core goal of Shelley is decentralization. He explains that ?ôByron?? the previous product release, was all about community and introducing the concept of Cardano to the world. ?úBuilding support, getting listed on exchanges, getting APIs [application programming interface] right and being able to build a help desk process and getting a community management right. That?ôs very hard to do. Now we have regular releases, an ecosystem and great infrastructure. Now, that we have that, we start moving from a top down model to a more of a decentralized ecosystem,??said Hoskinson. Separately, IOHK has recently signed a memorandum of understanding with the Ethiopian government to train and hire junior software developers and use Cardano in its agriculture industry. Another initiative launched in Africa involved women from Ethiopia and Uganda have also being taught to code and get to grips with Haskell which is the most important programming language used by IOHK.

June 07, 2019
","The U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange Poloniex faces a backlash from the community that is unsatisfied with their risk management, and they might even face lawsuits in the U.S.  ","As the exchange, owned by major crypto company Circle, explains in yesterday?ôs blog post, altcoin CLAM went through a severe price crash on May 26. Many CLAM margin traders defaulted and Bitcoin margin lenders suffered a loss of 1,800 BTC (c. USD 13.5 million at current market prices). All defaulted accounts have been frozen until the loans are repaid.Poloniex?ôs peer-to-peer margin system works in a way that the lenders are getting the interest for lending, while the borrowers must hold a certain amount of collateral to be able to guarantee that the amount they borrow will be repaid. When a borrower can?ôt pay back the loan, they default. Furthermore, many borrowers who defaulted had used CLAM for collateral, which crashed sharply on May 26 (similar scenario happened on June 6, when the coin flash-crashed again before rebounding).CLAM price chartBy allowing a tiny illiquid shitcoin to be used as collateral, Polo allowed an attacker to washtrade this coin, CLAM, to any price he wants and drive up the value of his own fake collateral.What Poloniex did next is baffling to many. There was a -78% crash on Poloniex CLAM market a few days ago. And there was margin trading on this pair...Poloniex just socialized the -1800btc of ((liquidation)) losses to all BTC margin lenders on the platform with a 16.2% haircut. wowhttps://t.co/jDUXRhs6Mv pic.twitter.com/JErXdR0uB5___""We took a lot of bitcoin.  It's no big deal."" https://t.co/JiD9iBvRUHThe exchange socialized the 1,800 BTC loss and took 16.202% among majority of all active BTC loans, including those that were not active when the crash occurred. What does it mean to socialize losses? In this case, losses are treated as a responsibility of a particular society as a whole (in this case the users of the exchange) and all must contribute to its repayment. The practice is considered unfair, especially since the earning of the property are always exclusively the property of the shareholders and are not socialized. Furthermore, in the U.S., where Poloniex is based, it is illegal to socialize losses, so the exchange might see a number of lawsuits heading their way in that country. ?úAny crypto exchange that socializes losses is begging for a lawsuit,??David Silver, an attorney specializing in securities law, told the Block.According to the exchange, this affected 0.4% of their users, but the community is dissatisfied with their actions. In their post, Poloniex says that it's pursuing the defaulted borrowers in order to get them to return the BTC owned; it's also removing margin trading for CLAM, BTS, FCT, and MAID, adding additional layers to the processes already in place to monitor risk in margin markets, and putting additional market protection in place.The community, however, finds that Poloniex lacked in quality and sufficient number of controls to monitor the liquidity of the asset, which would warn traders in time. Analyst Sylvain Ribes tweeted yesterday in response to the exchange?ôs blog post: ?úUncharitable solution to a problem that should never have been allowed to happen if Poloniex had anything vaguely resembling a risk manager in their staff.?ùCEO of the fund management company Three Arrows Capital, Su Zhu, also tweeted: ?úJust to give you a sense of the intellectual and moral bankruptcy involved here, when OKEx (an unregulated ""Chinese"" exchange) had a similar issue last year on their btc futures, OKEx donated 2.5k btc out of goodwill to help cover.?ùPart of the reason okex was able to do it was bc they've always kept huge amounts of their treasury as btc.The exchanges that keep all their treasures as fiat have no way to cover any sudden losses or issues denominated in btc.Poloniex is ranked as the 71st largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, which stands at USD 33 million in the past 24 hours, according to market data provider Coinpaprika.com.

","The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), the country?ôs leading tax authority, has suggested that cryptocurrency taxation clampdowns are on their way. The agency hinted that individuals and businesses across the country will need to fall in line with compliance regulations ??or potentially face prosecution. (The article has been updated on June 26 in order to include comments (in bold) from the Australian Tax Office.)","Answering to Cryptonews.com questions, the CRA said that its probes have unearthed evidence that non-payment of tax on crypto-earnings is common in Canada.The CRA stated,?úWe have learned that there are many types of cryptocurrencies and cryptocurrency businesses across Canada and that the risk of non-compliance is high, which reinforces the importance of compliance work in this market segment. ?úAs previously reported, the CRA has been operating a specialized cryptocurrency unit since 2017. Earlier this year it confirmed that it was conducting some 60 audits  into companies or individuals involved in cryptocurrency trading and/or mining. 
______________________________________________________________________________The CRA also confirmed that these audits are ?ústill active,??and that the results were ?únot yet available.?ùHowever, the CRA says that it is aware that many cases of tax evasion involve cryptocurrencies. The CRA told Cryptonews.com,?úGenerally speaking, [crypto-related tax crimes] are becoming more sophisticated, and we are seeing a growing number of cases with some kind of cyber or crypto component.??Moreover, Canada is a part of a cross-border investigation with the J5 ??a joint tax authority task force comprising representatives from the United States, the UK, the Netherlands, Australia and Canada. As reported, J5 is involved in more than 50 investigations involving international enablers of tax evasion, including an undisclosed global financial institution and its intermediaries who facilitate taxpayers to hide their income and assets.The CRA said that they are not breaking up the cases into different categories (e.g. crypto-related), because many cases have multiple components to them, not just cyber or enablers of money laundering.""Each of the ongoing investigations involve multiple J5 countries. Targets are a variety of entities, and criminal charges are the goal,"" they added.Also, according to the CRA, J5 aims to learn from international best practices to find ways to share and analyze information more efficiently.""We will significantly improve our knowledge about international cybercrime, the use of cryptocurrencies and the enablers of tax fraud and use this knowledge to take effective action to disrupt these criminal attacks on global financial systems,"" they added.J5 is currently working on developing shared strategies, establishing joint operations, piloting international virtual teams and exploring new ways of strengthening their ability to collaborate globally.""J5 investigations are not just about trying to get tax back, they are about increasing transparency and protect revenue on a go forward basis. By demonstrating that there are significant penalties for participating or facilitating transnational tax related crimes will serve as a deterrent to participate and therefore improve the integrity of the tax system,"" a spokesperson of the Australian Tax Office told Cryptonews.com in a separate interview. 
According to the spokesperson, new regulations and new technologies that look to track and trace cryptocurrencies through the blockchain will continue to increase transparency: ""If we see evidence of criminality we will work with domestic enforcement partners as well as international tax partners to find them.""""J5 investigations are not just about trying to get tax back, they are about increasing transparency and protect revenue on a go forward basis.

","Kenetic will soon be launching a new venture capital fund that is ?úpure equity, obviously blockchain only?? Jehan Chu, co-founder and managing partner at Kenetic Capital, a blockchain investment and advisory firm, told Cryptonews.com in an interview about their plans, the blockchain generation in Asia and gradual decentralization.","Chu shared that Kenetic is in the process of raising money, but already started making investments. They?ôre closing their sixth investment at the moment. In terms of numbers, ?úI will say that we are raising an 8-digit fund,??he said without elaborating any further on the fund and the investments. Also, they?ôve returned all of the principal from the 2018 one-year token vehicle (not a regulated investment fund, as it was a private company), while the company had 50%-60% returns on that vehicle.Their investment thesis is twofold, he explains. The first part is ?úequity focus and later stage in crypto?? They only invest in blockchain projects, mostly looking at those that are slightly later stage, with traction and product market fit revenue, among other things. Some of the projects they invested in include the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission-licensed security token exchange SharesPost, mobile bitcoin wallet app Abra, and BlockFi ??a crypto lending platform with ?úa double-digit growth.?ùThe second part of the thesis is Asia. ?úAsia is the key driver of blockchain globally and will be in the future?? Many events contribute to this, like U.S.-China trade war pushing capital to Asia, the tightening up of intellectual property, the U.S. markets becoming increasingly restrictive, etc. ?úWhile the Internet generation was focused around Silicon Valley, the blockchain generation will be in Asia.?ùFurthermore, to help communities use blockchain, Chu co-founded Social Alpha Foundation (SAF) with his wife, the chairman Nydia Zhang. It is a not-for-profit platform that provides grants and focuses on supporting blockchain education and outreach.?úI think that semi centralization [and enterprise-led adoption] is the gateway to pure decentralization, which I think is the eventual future,??Chu said. ?úAnd I think that in the long run, pure decentralized applications will benefit from the acclimation of users and the normalization of blockchain through [?? semi-decentralized and enterprise-proven pathways.?ùWhile the first generation pure utility token was an experiment of sorts, for the new generation and mature crypto investing, equity and hybrids (equity and utility token), or pure security tokens, will increasingly be part of the equation, as experienced entrepreneurs enter the space.There is an enterprise-led adoption curve, Chu says, ?úand what this means is that the first hundred million customers will be enterprise customers?? Large companies like Facebook, Line, Kakao, Alibaba, JPMorgan, Fidelity, Apple are creating a crypto future for their customers. ?úConversion is much easier than adoption?? Customer acquisition is hard, expensive, and takes a long time. Facebook's latest move ?úabsolutely drives forward the overall mission of blockchain in all of its forms,??as is much easier for them to create a stablecoin and enable it inside of the WhatsApp messaging application, converting hundreds of millions of users. Pure decentralized community has fewer users, and at this rate it will take much longer, maybe a decade or two, to get to real mainstreaming. While lacking anticensorship and efficiency, semi-decentralization has near-term utility and billions of users that can be converted in a couple of years.Major stock exchanges are already looking into how blockchain and tokenization will impact them.?úWe don't know exactly how long it's going to take, but capital markets will either be blockchain-based or tokenized eventually?? Chu says. ?úSo that's not really up for debate. It's a timing issue.?ùChu?ôs most recent prediction was that bitcoin will reach USD 30,000 by the end of the year and he still stands by it, but thinks that we?ôre already seeing the expected pullback. ?úWe could go as low as the 6,000 level,??he says, but finds that various developments, increasing number of institutions coming into the crypto space, and the announcements by major companies might potentially cause a massive rally. All of this makes it easier for institutional investors whose ?úminimum ticket is 100 million??dollars to come in. ?úThere are a lot of people on the edge of the sidelines who are either planning to or are just about ready to come in and it's just a tipping point.?ùThere are many endowments already in the space, and ?úI think that we are exactly where we are supposed to be for institutional participation to take over the space and really drive us from a USD 7,800 bitcoin, well past a USD 30,000 Bitcoin, well into USD 100,000 bitcoin. [?? This is sheer gravity.?ùKenetic started off in 2016, with almost nobody wanting to invest in blockchain, so founders invested their own money. Both Jehan Chu and co-founder Lawrence Chu come from the investing background, unlike ?úpeople from the financial industry who are not used to taking a personal risk.??Chu started his career as a developer, then working as an art dealer, before discovering Bitcoin in 2013. He began investing and building some of the early communities, such as the Bitcoin Association of Hong Kong and an Ethereum community in Hong Kong in 2014. The Kenetic co-founders??investments in early projects and in equity provided a basis of their growth and are the reason Chu didn't find the digital asset world risky. ?úSo it wasn't really a shift?? he says, but ?úa formalization [?? and expansion of what we'd already been doing into a proper platform.?ùWatch Jehan Chu discussing Asia?ôs influence on our digital future at the Fluidity Summit in May 2018:",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

",(A spoiler-free article.),"On Tuesday, the cryptoverse was abuzz over the ""news"" that Game of Thrones, a popular TV series that has recently ended, actor and a lifelong animal rights and environmental advocate, Jerome Flynn, joined a blockchain-based vegan initiative VeganNation. Some crypto media outlets were referring to a press release provided to them, however, the news about the partnership was announced in December 2018.So what was the reason behind this attempt to get more attention? The answer might be simple - Israel-based VeganNation launched pre-sale of its VeganCoin, an utility token, in the end of April and it is still ongoing. According to their website, the soft cap of the token sale is USD 10 million, and the hard cap is USD 60 million. The company did not specify, when will the token sale end. However, in a blog post in December 2018, the same post that announced the partnership with Flynn, VeganNation said their partners ""raised more than USD 7 million for the official currency issue"". According to their ""Green Paper,"" the crowdsale was initially planned for September 2018. In either case, the news about Flynn joining the crypto project is circulating both in mainstream and crypto-focused media.For example, the actor talked about his joining the advisory board of the vegan initiative in an interview with Daily Mail, where he discussed his goal to utilize his fame for promotion of the vegan lifestyle through digital currency, thus economically empowering cruelty-free businesses, and maybe even redeeming his GoT character Ser Bronn. Wow, have all you watched the premiere last night?! ?ëëWinter is coming to VeganNation?ÑÔ∏è?å± Stay Tuned... #gameofthronesCheck out this important message from our advisory and GOT Star ‚≠?pic.twitter.com/jVlAYboIwIThe goal of VeganNation is to support vegan businesses and trade through the use of its own cryptocurrency. According to the company, Flynn has joined the initiative, ?úcreating an international vegan economy based on a virtual currency, the VeganCoin.??In that same blog post, Flynn was quoted as saying: ?úVegan Nation is the basis of an international vegan economy that makes vegan lives simpler, more economically and better for the Earth and the soul of each of us. VeganCoin will allow many more to become vegans and thereby contribute to our ecological footprint.?ùFlynn has been involved in projects and activism campaigns such as Farms Not Factories, Survival International, and White Lions in South Africa. He told Daily Mail: ?úI've not come across anything like Vegan Nation before. It?ôs trying to unite vegans and it's a wonderful idea with so much potential. And it's just starting as well, to develop a global economy, with a vegan infrastructure and economy at the heart of it, is amazing.?ùInterestingly, back in 2017, quite a few celebrities stood behind crypto and in support of it by endorsing or investing in it, such as globally popular Gwyneth Paltrow, Jamie Foxx, Floyd Mayweather, Paris Hilton, and Wu Tang Clan?ôs Ghostface Killah.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

","The text below is an excerpt from The Compendium of Cryptocurrency Remittances by George Harrap, CEO of Bitspark, a bankless money transfer solution utilising blockchain technology.
_____","It is impossible in the remittance world to ignore Western Union (WU).  The solid brand name is more than 150 years old, operates in every country of the world, is in 20,000 remittance corridors with over 550,000+ physical locations.In each country that WU is located in, it has local bank accounts, settlement facilities and an established compliance system. Not to mention, they are the largest online remittance service provider - bigger than every other company combined.Every company in the industry often compares themselves to WU, be it in pricing or distribution. Yet even while all these potential competitors rise and fall, WU continues to grow and outpace them all through sheer size and networks.WU has been a small but important voice in the growth of cryptocurrencies for cross-border payments. Most prominent perhaps was a trial with Ripple for XRP.However given the recent comments by Western Union CEO, it doesn?ôt seem like that is going anywhere. The reason Ripple is not useful to WU is that WU?ôs system is better. Some of this can be seen in the earlier sections about Xcurrent and Xrapid but essentially Ripple brings nothing to the table.Consider the below:1. Xcurrent is a database for settlement between banks. It enables instant exchange of payment data between banks connected in their network for settlement later outside of Ripple via SWIFT. WU has already pioneered this and it is tailored to the intricacies of 180 countries. WU can already net settle between itself and its own bank accounts in every country in the world as WU is on both ends in a closed loop. Banking partners in every jurisdiction help WU manage these payments in a predictable and complaint manner suitable to them - this infrastructure takes a long time to build.2. Xrapid uses XRP for settlement, however, it has no local fiat liquidity in any currency. It is not useful for WU to buy XRP in one location and sell it in another because it is often not possible to buy XRP in a certain location and selling XRP for local fiat for more than 1 to 2 currencies in sizes of <USD 5,000. Xrapid cannot support WU as WU needs to settle hundreds of millions of dollars, today.3. Bitcoin: A cryptocurrency like bitcoin may be viable in some very specific corridors but ultimately WU does not have the problem of capital requirements for pre-funding and arbitrage benefits would be difficult to scale.4. Let?ôs say WU did buy bitcoin or XRP. Who is selling XRP in Ghana? Or Azerbaijan? Or Cambodia? If WU needed to sell it, then they would either be selling for USD or selling to themselves. There is no point trading with yourself as you are essentially mimicking a net settlement database but with an added burden of managing a volatile token that is illiquid.5. WU would also need to be a cryptocurrency exchange on a massive scale. This is something they are not interested in doing. A cryptocurrency exchange is a way to ensure a trade with someone other than yourself and offload your current liability for payment to someone else. This is a tall order, even if WU ?òpartnered??with a bitcoin exchange, none of them cater to any more than 1 or 2 fiat currencies. WU needs 180+ currencies.The previous points apply to crypto, but let?ôs consider some other fintech alternatives. A company like Transferwise gets a lot of press with its endless comparisons to WU and sky-high valuation from venture capitals, but when you look a bit deeper some realities hit.??Transferwise is valued at USD 1.6 billion and pulled in USD 150 million in revenue with USD 8 million in profit.
??WU is bigger than Transferwise, World Remit and every other online remittance company combined with just WUs online payment system.
??WU has access to cash delivery, fintechs online do not. 90% of the remittance world works on cash.
??Often Transferwise and others do not settle in the local currency and, therefore, is not relevant to remittance countries where the payout is in local currency.
??Every top remittance country generally has a banking penetration of <25%. Therefore, a new app or ?òdeposit by bank??website is of zero relevance to someone in a remittance recipient country like Myanmar where people do not have a bank account.
??Fintechs like Transferwise need to settle via traditional FX providers or banks and will be subject to the same wholesale rates and limitations as everyone else.
??The last point is interesting, Transferwise has built a model on using pools of money for settlement and also using local FX companies like currency cloud.
_______The model is as per below:Pool of money A: USD 
Person A has USD and wants EUR     Pool of money B: EUR
Person B has EUR and wants USD
______Instead of doing a cross-border bank transfer for USD to EUR for each transaction, the pool of money in USD can be used to withdraw domestically cheaper to person B. Likewise person A can receive their USD from the pool of EUR domestically, also cheaper. The money in either pool did not need to move in this case, the two payments NET.This is fine for the big currency pairs of USD, EUR, JPY, AUD etc. However, low value remittances are not between these currencies and there is fundamentally always more money going to the destination than is coming out so it is impossible to NET.In a market where you need to be able to settle to exotic currencies, the pooling does not work. At the end of the day you need to have local cash distribution to enter these markets and also local banking partners. Something that the fintechs in Europe and US do not have.WU has local cash distribution points and local banking partners in every country of the world and the numbers speak for themselves.If companies that are trying to tackle the money transfer industry do not focus on cash, then they will never be able to add considerable value to the remittance industry.Western Union does NET settlement internally like these fintech companies but does not make it a marketing venture.Ultimately Western Union has its own FX division which is engaging constantly with the global markets by managing cash floats around the world and trading with counterparties in other currencies enabling them to exchange value.It includes:??Crypto to cash as a revenue opportunity
??Cash balancing between MTOs 24/7 via crypto.
??Linkage via crypto to online e-commerce and other financial services.
??Arbitrage gains in specific corridors.We often make note for MTOs to consider bitcoin and cryptocurrency as an additional revenue opportunity then consider it for settlement later.In the short term, the cash to cryptocurrency market is expanding rapidly, with bitcoin ATM usage growing exponentially. Cash to crypto exchange margins are 7-10% globally and for MTOs who already manage cash, this is an exciting addition to their product suite.Often MTOs may sell mobile top ups, travel packages or food to gain additional margins/customers and cryptocurrency can be considered as another product at another margin, which is growing rapidly. MTOs existing ability to manage cash floats is an added bonus.Another important feature is cash balancing. For large remittance networks with hundreds of locations, there is often the problem of cash balancing between physical locations.All physical remittance and exchange shops needs to have cash on hand to pay out incoming transactions, and often they run dry.In some cases it can mean that the business is not able to operate for the better part of a day or until they can retrieve more cash from the bank.This is particularly troublesome when it might be the end of a day, at bank closing times or when the bank is closed on a weekend and supply of cash is not easily obtained.Cryptocurrency sales are means to balancing cash between locations -  maintaining the equilibrium between optimal locations for people to deposit cash and exchange for digital currencies and cash heavy locations where it is good to sell digital currencies for cash.This self balancing via cryptocurrency requires no overheads, generates solid 7-10% margins and alleviates time and opportunity cost of balancing cash between bank accounts or agents in the field.The growing use of e-commerce globally has created large brands like Alibaba and Amazon, however currently the only means of payment in these online providers is by bank accounts, mobile payments or credit cards.This excludes the booming emerging market economies of the world and the 1.7 billion consumers who have no formal banking relationships.Physical cash agents can become the payment portals in the rest of the world?ôs 150 countries where credit card and banking penetration is low, with locations like WU agents becoming centre points for people buying products from Amazon, Alibaba or elsewhere.There are a few interesting cryptocurrency companies in this space to look at.While cryptocurrency arbitrage is a major selling point for cryptocurrency remittance companies, for WU it would not be their core offering but rather something that might be utilised at times when there is a dearth or excess liquidity in specific currencies.This would likely be managed by the WU trading divisions on a corridor by corridor basis.

Here is how they have ranked the ""most trusted and reliable exchanges"":The ranking components include: geography, legal/regulatory, investment, team/company, data provision, trade surveillance, and market quality. We see that exchanges in the top 10 category have received either AA or A grade, and all are in the 50-59 score range, save for Coinbase that is just above 60, though the differences in scores between an exchange and the one that immediately follows or precedes it is small. While most of these are relatively strong in the investments and market quality categories, certain points have been lacking in the geography and trade surveillance categories.There are ten exchanges, ranking 101 to 110, that have received the F grade. These are: Upbit Singapore (17.90), Coinroom (17.40), Yobit (17.20), Bit-M (16.90), AidosMarket (16.00), IQFinex (15.10), Ethermium (14.60), CryptoExchangeWS (13.10), LiveCoin (13.00), FatBTC (11.20) ??all significantly lacking in the legal category. However, according to CryptoCompare, Exchange Benchmark indicates that the exchanges who got C-F grades have increased market share by 30% in the last 12 months.Meanwhile, one of the top rated exchanges, the U.S.-based Poloniex, faces a backlash from the community that is unsatisfied with their risk management, and they might even face lawsuits. However, news about the exchange's problems surfaced in June, while CryptoCompare based its rankings on data collected in May.Also, following a number of unfortunate events, Coinbase got into the #DeleteCoinbase crisis earlier this year.Overall, the Benchmark is ranking 110 active spot exchanges globally, ?úoffering investors and traders a comprehensive, granular and reliable source of information on the best trading venues?? according to CryptoCompare.The ranking methodology is comprised of a combination of: Trading volume is not used directly in the ranking, as volumes can be easily manipulated, CryptoCompare concludes, and any untrusted exchange can provide false data.  Finally, ?úMetrics were categorized into several buckets and distributed fairly,??they explain, ?úto arrive at a final robust score, ensuring that no one metric overly influences the overall exchange ranking.??Meanwhile, just recently, it was also reported that only 10 out of 83 cryptocurrency exchanges, analyzed by crypto investment company Bitwise Asset Management, passed a test aimed to show if they were reporting systematically inflated bitcoin trading volumes. Out of the above mentioned exchanges, seven were on the ?úpassed??list to: Poloniex, Bitstamp, BitFlyer, itBit, Kraken, Binance, and Gemini.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

","A South Korean cryptocurrency payments platform Nupay is the latest company to be pulled into the aftermath of the long-running major Burning Sun K-pop drug, sex and prostitution scandal.","The scandal originated with a police investigation in January this year of an assault at a Seoul nightclub named Burning Sun, owned by Seungri, a member of popular boyband Big Bang.However, the investigation quickly intensified, with Seungri and a number of A-list Korean celebrities later found to have been involved in high-stakes drug deals and prostitution rings. The celebrities involved have been charged variously with soliciting prostitutes for big-paying clients, sexual assault and illicitly filming and sharing intimate videos of women taken without their consent.Big Bang?ôs talent agency, YG Entertainment ??one of the biggest K-pop talent stables in the country ??has also been implicated directly in the scandal. The Burning Sun scandal, that even has its own Wikipedia page,has also led to street protests. President Moon Jae-in has since ordered an investigation after several police officers implicated in the scandal were also accused of corruption.And now Nupay has been dragged into the scandal. The platform had been using Seungri as a model in its advertising campaigns prior to the scandal. But after the news of the boyband member?ôs arrest broke, a number of Nupay investors demanded refunds.Media outlet Asiae reports that although an unspecified number of investors have already been refunded, others are yet to receive payment ??and some are looking to sue Nupay for fraud.Nupay has turned to YG, Seungri?ôs exclusive agency, demanding a refund for the money it paid to the K-pop talent agency for advertising rights and an exclusive photo/video shoot.However, YG has said that as it had provided (unspecified) ?úsupport??for Seungri?ôs Nupay photo/video shoot, it would only be willing to provide the cryptocurrency company with a ?úpartial??refund.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

","American multinational footwear corporation Nike Inc. filed for a trademark with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) for the term ?úcryptokicks?? What this indicates, according to some in the crypto community, is that Nike might have plans to launch some kind of a cryptocurrency by this name. ","This assumption is further fueled by the contents of the application, filed this April, available to the public on USPTO?ôs website (search for ""cryptokicks"".) What could be understood from it is that Nike is planning to offer ?úfinancial services, namely, providing a digital currency or digital token for use by members of an on-line community.??The application is full of details and it further mentions cryptocurrency software and hardware wallets, that is: ?údownloadable computer software for managing cryptocurrency transactions using blockchain technology; Downloadable mobile applications for providing access to crypto-collectibles, crypto-art and application tokens; downloadable software for use in electronically trading, storing, sending, receiving, accepting and transmitting digital currency, and managing digital currency payment and exchange transactions [??,??among many other specifications for a possible future wallet. Furthermore, it seems that Nike would be creating an online marketplace for buyers and sellers of digital currency assets, featuring footwear and clothing, as well as a website that would feature online bulletin boards, forums, chat rooms, blogs, entertainment services, such as an online game, etc.A trademark law attorney and founder of Gerben Law firm, Josh Gerben, seems to be the first to notice the trademark application: Nike has filed a trademark application for CRYPTOKICKS.The filing indicates that Nike is intending to launch a cryptocurrency called CRYPTOKICKS.Below is my analysis of the filing and its implications ?ëá#nike#cryptocurrency pic.twitter.com/82gAPlzrXyGerben told news publication Portland Business Journal that Nike?ôs competitors have 30 days to oppose this trademark application.

","One of the most popular peer-to-peer (P2P) exchanges, LocalBitcoins caught the cryptoworld by surprise when they apparently stopped offering in-person cash trades on its list of options, leaving its users in 248 countries to search for alternatives.","The news broke out when some of the exchange?ôs users said on the Reddit platform that their in-person fiat trades have been canceled. What this means is that people can?ôt utilize this platform as a way to meet in person and sell Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies for cash or cash for crypto. LocalBitcoins hasn?ôt made any official announcements as to why they removed this option, though some Reddit users have been commenting that the move might be related to the recent legal updates. The Finland-based company declined to comment when contacted by Cryptonews.com.Whether this is temporary or permanent, the question remains what are the alternatives to LocalBitcoins? There are a number of P2P exchanges that traders have been turning to buy or sell their cryptos with cash. Reddit user HeycheFKay, for example, suggests Payfair as a viable alternative, claiming to be an investor and a satisfied user of the platform. Quite a few commenters to their post have agreed, stating that Payfair is a ""good, though underpromoted,"" escrow alternative to LocalBitcoins. PayFair.io is a decentralized escrow platform offering a range of cryptocurrencies to over 35 fiat pairs, which, most importantly for this story, allows cash trades.Other common suggestions online include Bisq and Paxful. Bisq is an open-source, peer-to-peer application that allows in-person cash trades, and enables a number of cryptocurrencies to be bought without registration. Though users complain of a low volume, it has also been mentioned online that this LocalBitcoin situation might bring more people to Bisq. Meanwhile, according to their website, Paxful offers over 300 payment methods to choose from, including cash deposits, gift cards, bank transfers, etc.  CEO of Paxful tweeted:  LocalBitcoins is now Remote Bitcoins. They took down all their cash offers and the refugees are flooding to @paxful VIP support for all Cash vendors! We won?ôt let you down. Cash is still king in the emerging world!Hodl Hodl, a peer-to-peer Bitcoin exchange, is another often suggested alternative, where available payment methods depend on users' location. However, it is not available in the USA. Meanwhile, in direct response to LocalBitcoins, LocalEthereum, a peer to peer marketplace where people can buy or sell Ethereum (ETH), has dropped the trading fee on cash-in-person exchanges to 0%. This option will be available until July 1st, during which period people can meet in person to buy or sell ETH with cash without additional fees.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

","The small and remote Pacific island country, the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI), has announced that they have formed a non-profit organization, called the SOV Development Fund, moving forward with their coin project despite the warnings by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). ","The purpose of this Fund is ?úto support the government in the establishment, maintenance and implementation of the SOV,??the nation?ôs digital legal tender, according to a press release. ?úOnce the SOV is established, the goal is to transition to an alternative governance model based on blockchain,"" the Fund said. In what way is this to be accomplished, it remains to be seen. The Fund, however, will receive 30% of the coin?ôs initial supply.The country uses the U.S. dollar as its currency and is dependent on foreign aid from the United States paid in dollars. It was in early 2018 that the country announced the establishment of their national cryptocurrency, called ?òSovereign??(SOV). In September, however,  the IMF has warned RMI against such a move, calling it too risky to adopt a cryptocurrency as a second legal tender, citing a number of specific reasons, and stating that: ?úThe potential benefits from revenue gains appear considerably smaller than the potential costs arising from economic, reputational, AML/CFT [Anti-Money Laundering and Countering Financing of Terrorism], and governance risks.?ùHowever, RMI replied then that they acknowledge the risk from issuing the SOV, but they are confident that the advanced technology would provide sufficient risk mitigation.How will the SOV Development Fund function? According to the press release, it will be fully independent and will have a board of seven directors. However, two of those directors are to be nominated by the Marshall Islands government, while two others will be nominated by the company that the government hired to develop SOV?ôs compliant blockchain infrastructure, SFB Technologies. After that, a unanimous vote by these four directors will be needed to appoint three more internationally recognized experts in the fields of blockchain, banking, and monetary management. ?úQualified majorities will be required for all major decisions, to ensure the fund operates with prudence and stability and adheres to its mandate?? stands in the release. The Fund?ôs mandate is ?úto maintain the SOV infrastructure long term; to seed the ecosystem around the SOV; to promote the SOV and its uses, both domestically and internationally; [and] to smooth the volatility of the SOV by selling and buying SOV against USD,??said Peter Dittus, Chief Economist for SOV.Meanwhile, in March, Israeli startup Neema, which has partnered with RMI on the development of the SOV, stated that the coin will likely be launched this year, but also that a lot more work is still required to satisfy the United States financial regulators, according to The Times of Israel.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

","Only 10 out of 83 cryptocurrency exchanges, analyzed by crypto investment company Bitwise Asset Management, passed a test aimed to show if they were reporting systematically inflated bitcoin  trading volumes.","The 10 that passed, in the order of their average daily volume during April 2019 from the highest to the lowest, are: Exchange  (Daily volume in million USD):Binance (218)
Bitfinex (78)

Bittrex (8)
Poloniex (4) 
Total trading volume: USD 554 millionSouth Korean exchanges once again were excluded from the analysis, as Bitwise explains, due to their volumes being isolated from the globally connected bitcoin market because of the capital controls.The authors of the analysis aimed to identify the exchanges that were reporting systematically inflated volumes, that is, any reported trading volume that does not reflect legitimate price found in the market. They have put the exchanges through three tests: The paper, which is addition to the research that Bitwise presented to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in March, 2019, confirms their earlier findings that about 95% of all reported volume, or to be more precise, USD 10.5 billion out of the USD 11 billion in reported average daily spot bitcoin volume, is either fake volume or wash-trading. In the paper presenting these findings, published on May 24th 2019, titled ?úEconomic and Non-Economic Trading In Bitcoin: Exploring the Real Spot Market For The World?ôs First Digital Commodity?? authors claim that public perception of bitcoin?ôs spot trading market as being disorderly, inefficient, ?úwith wildly variant pricing and strange volume patterns??is wrong. They find that ?úthe modern bitcoin spot market is both significantly smaller and significantly more efficient than commonly understood?? and that ?úeffective arbitrage keeps prices on real bitcoin spot exchanges around the world in lockstep, with meaningful pricing discrepancies eliminated in a matter of seconds,??especially given the massive changes after December 2017.There are quite a few ways in which exchanges can inflate volume, and have so far suffered little to no consequences for doing so, including but not limited to practices such as: Reasons to inflate volume are usually twofold, according to the paper?ôs authors, the first being trader lead-generation through league table dominance ??major data aggregators, such as CoinMarketCap, are an important source of lead-generation for new exchanges that want to build volume, as they are more likely to attract attention if they are at the top of popular lists. The second motivator to exaggerate volume is listing fees from ICOs ??to attract listing fees from initial coin offerings.After one of the comments to their previous study pointed to a probable gray area, the paper too states that there likely is a gray area between exchanges with 100% real volume and those with 100% fake volume. The authors took Gate.io as an example, stating: ?úWe could reasonably argue with someone about whether Gate.io is a fake volume exchange or not, or whether some percentage estimate of its volume should be applied to our total volume statistics.??They add: ?úThe reality is, however, that Gate.io does not have enough volume for this question to meaningfully alter our conclusions: Gate.io reported [USD] 12 million in average daily volume in the month of April where the total daily volume of the 10 real volume exchanges was [USD] 554 million. Even if we counted all of Gate.io?ôs volume as real, none of our analysis would change.?ùIn an interview with Cryptonews.com in April, Gate.io claimed that their ?úvolume is all real, and right now we?ôre averaging about USD 50 million per day.??The company also said that they?ôre certified by Blockchain Transparency Institute, a group of blockchain data researchers and enthusiasts, that is known for their reports on wash trading (however, the website of the project does not disclose who the members of this for profit group are.)

","Facebook?ôs Libra token is already facing a legal threat, with senior American parliamentarians asking the social network to cease ?úmomentum going forward??while they probe the project ??and take their fight to the greater cryptocurrency industry.","Per an official statement from Maxine Waters, chairwoman of the House of Representatives??Financial Services Committee, and a letter to Walters from fellow committee member and representative Patrick McHenry, it appears that some key American lawmakers take a dim view of Libra ??and cryptocurrencies in general. The social network unveiled its white paper yesterday, but it took politicians just a short time to respond.Waters wrote:?úGiven the company?ôs troubled past, I am requesting that Facebook agree to a moratorium on any movement forward on developing a cryptocurrency until Congress and regulators have the opportunity to examine these issues and take action.?ùShe also added that Facebook had ?úrepeatedly??shown ?údisregard??for customer data privacy, and that it had ?úexposed Americans to malicious and fake accounts from bad actors, including Russian intelligence and transnational traffickers.?ùAnd in a broader swipe aimed at cryptocurrencies in general, she added:?úThe cryptocurrency market currently lacks a clear regulatory framework to provide strong protections for investors, consumers, and the economy. Regulators should see this as a wake-up call to get serious about the privacy and national security concerns, cybersecurity risks, and trading risks that are posed by cryptocurrencies.??______________________________________________________________McHenry, meanwhile, wrote in his letter, a  scan of which was posted in a tweet by CNN reporter Brian Fung:?úIt is incumbent upon us as policymakers to understand Project Libra. We need to go beyond the rumors and speculations and provide a forum to assess this project and its potential unprecedented impact on the global financial system.?ùAs Bitcoin and blockchain advocate Caitlin Long estimated even before the official Libra announcement, Facebook will face ?úregulatory uncertainty??as a result of its token launch, leading to scrutiny for ?úmany outdated financial regulations.??However, Facebook?ôs regulatory reporting program will lead to wider public dialogue in the United States centering on data and financial privacy rules, the reporting of assets held overseas and tax regulations.Meanwhile, as reported, not only American lawmakers are worried about the Libra project. French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said Libra shouldn?ôt be seen as a replacement for traditional currencies and called the G7 countries to prepare a report on Facebook?ôs project for July meeting.Also, Bank of England governor Mark Carney, who met Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg earlier this year, said he is keeping an ?òopen mind??on the potential utility of Facebook?ôs planned cryptocurrency, but warned it may face strict regulation if it takes off, Reuters reported.At the same time, the Bank of Canada said it will review Facebook?ôs Libra whitepaper ?úvery carefully,??The Canadian Press reported.""Global regulators are more scared of Facebook exerting more dominance over more aspects of the economy than they are scared of decentralized, leaderless technologies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. So in this case, Bitcoin and Ethereum and other assets, cryptocurrency protocols essentially get to hide in plain sight for another leg up and growth,"" Ryan Selkis, Messari Inc. co-founder and chief executive officer, said in an interview with Bloomberg.Industry players have also reacted with a mix of positivity and concern following Facebook?ôs Libra announcement ??and you can check out the most important of both here.

","Telegram?ôs new cryptocurrency, the Gram, will go on pre-sale through Japanese exchange platform Liquid by Quoine on July 10, ahead of a full-scale launch slated for October 31.","However, there are several twists in the tale already, as residents of Japan, the United States and dozens of other countries (including North Korea!) will not be eligible to buy tokens.Also, Liquid?ôs pre-sale does not appear to be a listing, per se.

","It was a crazy week for Binance: first, there was the 7,000 BTC hack, which was followed by heated debates about Bitcoin block reorganization, and finished with mutual public apologies.","Now, the major cryptocurrency exchange is working on new security measures. One of the new implementations is going to be a Universal 2nd Factor (U2F) support. It will let users protect their accounts with hardware devices like YubiKey and its alternatives. According to Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, they'll start to support such devices ""very soon"": ""We will run an event and give away 1,000 YubiKeys as soon as that feature is implemented.""YubiKey by Yubico, a Silicon Valley headquartered company, is a U2F device which aims to strengthen and simplife two-factor authentication (2FA) process. It utilizes FIDO2, WebAuthn, and FIDO Universal 2nd Factor open authentication standards, as well as USB-A, USB-C, and NFC technologies.A physical key is deemed to be the most secure 2FA method. Solutions by Yubico are deployed by some of the biggest tech companies including Google, Facebook, GitHub, Salesforce, Dropbox, as well as the governments of the United Kingdom and Turkey. According to KrebsonSecurity, there were no reported or confirmed employer account takeovers since implementing the security keys at Google. The keys work the following way: when logging in into your account, you are prompted to insert the encrypted hardware key into your computer. Hence, even if someone manages to get their hands on your password, they still can?ôt do anything. Besides, the keys don?ôt work on phishing sites. All-in-all, unlike with SMS or Google authentication, there are very few ways for the hackers to get your hardware device. YubiKey can also be used with mobile devices. Consumer grade products retail for USD 20 - USD 60.Congrats for @Yubico and @cz_binance @cz_binance for the future of crypto security... Having hacked before on bittrxx I know how it feels to lose a big portion of my money =( .. U2F security will bring the masses to crypto ! Can't wait !____For example trading bots typically have an API key, just a string password, to login and trade, deposit, or withdraw. That authentication should be hardened with a Yubikey to make it much harder to abuse the API as you can't simply steal a password.There are several U2F hardware key providers. Users can choose devices like Google Titan Key, Thetis, and Kensington but their devices are not as widely supported as Yubico.Binance is not the first exchange to implement U2F authentication. Exchanges like Bitfinex, Kraken, Coinbase, BitMEX, BitBay, BitGo, Coinfloor, and Nanex have already implemented hardware 2FA verification options. Meanwhile, other security-minded crypto exchanges might implement the U2F authentication option in the future as the circle of established and unhacked cryptocurrency exchanges is shrinking.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

","Major cryptocurrency exchange Binance confirmed it will enter the U.S. market via partnership with a local company, BAM Trading Services.

Moreover, the exchange announced it will block Binance.com users coming from the U.S in 90 days.","""Binance will license its cutting-edge matching engine and wallet technologies to its U.S. partner BAM to launch Binance.US, acknowledged by its recently approved FinCEN [The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network] registration on June 11, 2019,"" the exchange said, adding that they'll share more information ""at a later date.""Details about BAM Trading Services are scarce.

","As potential new major competitors pop-up one after another and the old ones are overhauling their businesses, Ripple, a California-based blockchain startup focusing on the banking sector, tries not to show that the newcomers might weaken its positions. ","During Fortune?ôs Brainstorm Finance conference on Thursday, Brad Garlinghouse showed that he was not worried. As a matter of fact, he said that this is going to be ?úthe best week for signed contracts at Ripple ever?? as the announcement of Libra will lead to business for Ripple, because ?úFacebook kind of came out and said ?òwe don?ôt need Western Union anymore?ô‚Ä? This means that more banks may consider using the xCurrent banking payment software and XRP  coin for transferring money across borders. Also, banks may consider switching from the SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Communication) software that is traditionally used for cross-border payments to some newer technologies to be able to compete in the market place.As reported by Cryptonews.com, SWIFT says it isn't scared of blockchain and has been gradually overhauling its network over the past couple of years. Also, George Harrap, CEO of Bitspark, a bankless money transfer solution utilising blockchain technology, recently argued that the reason Ripple is not useful to Western Union (WU) is that ""WU?ôs system is better"". ""Some of this can be seen in the earlier sections about Xcurrent and Xrapid but essentially Ripple brings nothing to the table,"" he said.Meanwhile, Garlinghouse reminded yesterday that Facebook did not launch a cryptocurrency, but wrote a whitepaper, and maybe in a year crypto Libra will be out. He also said he doesn?ôt believe that there will be ?úone coin to rule them all.?ù‚ÄúThe industry has gone from illicit to speculation to utility?îthe entrance of huge tech and finance players speak to that change. But all digital assets should not be lumped together?îyou need to evaluate based on use case.??@bgarlinghouse at @FortuneMagazine?ôs #BrainstormFinance pic.twitter.com/NIbUgAT5EdHe also discussed Ripple?ôs deal with MoneyGram, which involves Ripple purchasing an 8%-10% stake in the major money transfer company. Garlinghouse said that ?úit was a big deal for Ripple and even a bigger deal for the cryptocurrency markets overall.??But while the deal made MoneyGram?ôs shares jump by 168%, it seemed to have had little effect on XRP. ?úThere is a lot of noise?? Garlinghouse says, ?úand I think it?ôs really hard for people looking at these ecosystems to understand what is real and what is noise.??While some in the market do not look convinced it?ôs all that good for Ripple, others have reacted quite positively to all the recent developments with Bitcoin, finding that competition will push Ripple to work faster and better.I'll just say this from a business perspective. There is competition coming from all directions. People are afraid of what could happen. But the reality is competition is fantastic. It will drive Ripple to implement faster and more efficient. Competition lights the rocket fuel. https://t.co/WKMjnEjVvmSenior analyst at trading platform eToro, Mati Greenspan tweeted quoting Garlinghouse saying during the Brainstorm Conference: ""I don't think that there will be one crypto to rule them all. I own bitcoin and am long bitcoin"", and Greenspan commented: ?úQuite a turnaround from [Brad Garlinghouse]. Great stuff!!?? though others have pointed out he?ôs held that position for a while now.
______________________________________________________________________________________Ran NeuNer, CEO of Onchain Capital, a crypto investment and advisory business, also tweeted saying: ?úIronically, I really believe that Libra was the best thing to happen to XRP!?ùAll of these ?úRipple killer??statements are eerily similar to the ?úBitcoin is dead??and ?úEthereum killer??statements... when you?ôre on top everyone is gunning for you.

",Two U.S.-based exchanges have recently announced the delisting of several cryptocurrencies for U.S. customers supposedly in response to the regulatory uncertainty pertaining to what cryptoassets will be considered as securities and which ones will not by the country?ôs financial regulator. ,"Moreover, this past Friday, Binance announced that, starting September 12, it will block U.S. customers from trading on its main exchange, Binance.com, as it aims to launch a local exchange, Binance.US. However, it?ôs still not clear what tokens will be available on this platform.As a result, trading crypto is becoming more limited in the U.S., which begs the question: ?úWhat can traders do about this??ùHere are a few suggestions:In light of the limited asset offering by two popular digital asset exchanges, U.S. traders might need to switch to offshore exchanges to fulfill their altcoin trading needs. Depending on the exchanges in question, that could mean using smaller, unregulated exchanges that are less liquid and riskier to use. However, there is currently nothing keeping investors from trading on offshore platforms. Additionally, U.S. traders could switch trading activities to decentralized exchanges (DEX). In the case of the Binance DEX, which is not fully decentralized, it would mean trading directly within supported wallets. Effectively all Ethereum, EOS and Tron-based DEXs are (still) freely accessible for U.S. traders while the popular decentralized bitcoin exchange, Bisq, can also be used by everyone. Using a VPN (virtual private network) on centralized exchanges that have geoblocked the U.S. or that have limited assets for U.S. customers is a risky affair because should the user be required to fill out a KYC (know-your-customer) form to withdraw funds, a loss of funds could be the result if the user should not have been using the platform in the first place. Finally, U.S.-based traders, especially those trading in high volumes, could switch to trading only the cryptoassets that have been de facto approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), such as bitcoin and ether, plus those that have been approved as security tokens. While that may significantly reduce the investable universe, it would ensure that no funds would be in jeopardy due to any upcoming new regulation in the U.S. As Cryptonews.com reported on May 17, U.S. digital asset exchange Poloniex has ceased to offer the trading of nine cryptoassets over ?úregulatory uncertainty in the US market.??______________________________________________________________________________________Currency pairs for Ardor (ARDR), Bytecoin (BCN), Decred (DCR), GameCredits (GAME), Gas (GAS), Lisk (LSK), Nxt (NXT), Omni (OMNI), and Augur (REP) were disabled for U.S. customers on May 29 because the exchange was not able to ascertain whether these assets will be categorized as securities or not in the future by U.S. regulators. International customers were not affected by these changes. Bittrex also made the decision to delisted a number of cryptocurrencies for U.S. users. In a statement, the company said that ?úcertain markets will no longer be accessible to U.S. Customers. U.S. customers will have access to a more limited number of markets than are available to Non-U.S. Customers on Bittrex International.?ùThe assets in question include Qtum (QTUM), Storj (STORJ), and 32 other altcoins. U.S. customers will not be able to trade in markets for these assets as of June 21 but will still be able to hold these coins and tokens in their Bittrex wallets. While Bittrex does not explicitly state the reasons for banning its U.S.-based users from trading these markets, we can assume that the regulatory uncertainty surrounding what assets are securities and which ones are not will have played a role in the decision. Meanwhile, the non-custodial exchange Binance DEX, that was launched in April ?úto empower community growth and foster the industry?ôs long-term vision of peer-to-peer trading,??states in its terms of service that it will prohibit users from 29 countries, including the United States, from using its platform. However, Binance CEO, Changpeng Zhao, responded to the community on Twitter saying that the website used to access the decentralized exchange, binance.org, will be geoblocking countries but that the blockchain protocol cannot and will not. The messages being passed is wrong. https://t.co/VtrSxEaW22 (the website) blocks certain countries; DEX (the blockchain) does not, it can't. And there are plenty of wallets support trading on DEX directly.Website ??Blockchain. ?òÇ?òÇ?òÇCZ added: ?úYou can trade on @binance_dex using any one of these wallets directly, without going through www.binance.org  at all.??For example, you can use the Binance-owned Trust Wallet to trade directly on the Binance DEX. While this is good news for U.S.-based traders who want to transact in BEP-2 tokens (tokens on the Binance blockchain, Binance Chain), it may still expose Binance to regulatory action in the U.S. because Binance DEX is owned by Binance and is not a fully decentralized network like Bitcoin, for example. Meanwhile, decentralized exchanges might also face certain issues. In November 2018, the SEC charged the founder of the Ethereum-based decentralized exchange EtherDelta with operating an unregistered securities exchange. Given that users can add any token they want on decentralized exchanges, it also means that security tokens can end up on DEXs. Binance could have made the decision to geoblock the U.S. to prevent that from happening.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

","Crypto business is booming. Prices have been surging, the market has experienced a period of bullish growth and some are asking themselves if the heady days of 2017 are back. And just like 2017, much of the market positivity is coming from East Asia again ??South Korea in particular.","But there is just one thing missing. Where is the notorious kimchi premium?From a South Korean perspective, the kimchi premium is possibly one of the most unfair things ever to happen to cryptocurrency prices. The phenomenon was rooted in the early months of 2017, when South Korean traders found themselves paying 10% more than the global average for tokens at domestic exchanges. By mid-2017, that figure had doubled. And by December 2017, the kimchi premium had peaked at a whopping 50%.However, recent data compiled by Money Today indicates that as of September last year, South Koreans are no longer paying more for their tokens than the rest of the world.And even though the market has turned decidedly bullish again, the kimchi premium has shown no signs of returning yet. In fact, the data from early April shows that the ?úbig four??South Korean exchanges (Bithumb, Upbit, Korbit and Coinone) were selling Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin and EOS for prices of about 1% lower than the global average.A Busan-based cryptocurrency trader who goes by the screen name Narstee told Cryptonews.com:?úIf you?ôre cautious and you pay attention to global trends and movements on South Korean exchanges, you can still make good money buying and selling cryptocurrencies. It?ôs a competitive scene, and lots of newer exchanges have big airdrop events. If you are a discerning buyer, you can often get tokens cheaper on domestic exchanges than on overseas platforms ??I know I have!?ùBlockchain technology consultant Mira Kim told Cryptonews.com, ?úI don?ôt want to jinx it, but confidence is slowly returning to the market here. People are increasing the size of their investments after a long period of just letting their savings sit in the bank.?ùSouth Koreans have had plenty of reasons to stay away from crypto since early 2018. The bear market hit the country harder than most.The government?ôs hard-line stance on cryptocurrency has been another deterring factor for some. Seoul has adopted a unique two-pronged policy, hoping to invest heavily in blockchain technology incentives, while at the same time banning initial coin offerings (ICOs) and forcing exchanges to operate in the same business world as gambling dens and night-life venues.This approach has drawn criticism from both the domestic industry and international crypto-advocates like Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin.But many South Koreans ??both young and old ??feel that crypto is still a very attractive financial investment.Property prices have fallen slightly this year, due largely to government intervention in the housing market. But the price drop is still largely insignificant ??dipping by just over 1% since the start of 2019 after years of double-digit growth. Experts agree that houses are still far too expensive for most ordinary folk to consider.And the stock market, which six months ago plunged to its lowest levels since 2008 remains stagnant. Prices are even falling for smartphones and semiconductors, South Korea?ôs most steady-selling overseas exports, with Samsung ??the country?ôs biggest company ??issuing an ominous profits warning last month.Could it be, then, that South Koreans are once again turning to cryptocurrencies en masse? Could we see a return to the days when everyone from schoolchildren to octogenarians was buying big?Kim opined, ?úAfter everything we have been through with cryptocurrency regulations and the long bear market, you could say that investors here are due a break. Maybe instead of the premium, we are now getting a Korean bonus. Long may it last!??

June 08, 2019
","In the eternal struggle to predict the crypto market, ?òpaid groups??have risen in popularity.","While such groups assume various forms, they essentially involve paying one or more crypto analysts for access to a channel ??usually on social media ??in which the payer receives trading tuition, buy or sell signals, opportunities to trade collectively, or some combination of all three.For the inexperienced crypto buyer, such groups may seem like a godsend, particularly when they're run by seasoned veterans. However, some observers of the industry warn that, in many cases, they either provide advice accessible for free elsewhere, or they amount to little more than pump-and-dump groups that exploit their subscribers.Even though Cryptonews.com hasn't tested any of these paid groups yet and certainly can't vouch for their quality, it's worth highlighting a couple of them, purely as a way of providing concrete examples.Infocrypto, for instance, is a Brazil-based website and Telegram channel that offers subscribers daily analysis on Bitcoin movements, chat forums, personal support, and also bot-enabled trading signals. Likewise, Verified Crypto Traders is a Netherlands-based group that offers many of the same services, with a particular focus on BitMEX trading signals.For the curious, it costs anything from USD 99 to USD 228 per month to subscribe to Verified Crypto Traders' various plans, while some other less comprehensive groups go down to around USD 50 or USD 40 a month. Given the expense involved, the question then emerges of whether these groups offer value for money.""Personally, I'm very sceptical about paid groups,"" ex-president of TenX, one of the top 10 initial coin offerings of 2017, Julian Hosp, who?ôs developing his new undisclosed project, tells Cryptonews.com. ""The reason is very simple: if I'm a very good trader, why would I sell this information to the public? The very successful investors that I know, they want to keep their investment information to themselves, they don't want to publicly disclose that.""While Hosp doesn't want to go so far as labelling paid groups as 'scams,' he nonetheless states that he hasn't met anyone working in or with a paid trading group who has consistently made money via successful trades. ""So I would say that most of these traders make money either by selling courses, or by taking a position upfront and then sending out the message that this coin, or this trade, makes a lot of sense right now.""Hosp suggests that such 'pre-positioning' is ""very questionable."" Given his observations and those made, for example, by commentators on Reddit, it would therefore seem that paid trading groups should either be avoided altogether, or at least approached with caution.The trading groups themselves argue against this evaluation, with many pointing to the educational advice they offer as justification for their existence. This, at least, is one of the positions taken by crypto analysts Ryan Wilday and Avi Gilburt, both from the trading analysis website ElliottWaveTrader.net.""The free groups I?ôve seen are just not comprehensive,??they tell Cryptonews.com. ?úOur team does this full time, so we are dedicated. Our members can reach out to us around the clock with questions.

Speaking to Cryptonews.com, he points out that it?ôs unfair to generalize the sector based on its bad apples.?úThe logic is fallacious: many 'paid groups' are scams therefore all are scams,??he says. ?úSadly, its become a bit of a witch hunt on Twitter and scaring a lot of people who could do with some guidance, for a very fair price, from getting it.?ùOne big difference between 'better' trading groups and bad ones is presentation, with the more dubious groups often making unrealistic promises as to what traders could earn by joining them.""Users should be careful of outrageous claims,"" Wilday and Gilburt say. ""Typically a market edge is evident if trades are 60% to 70% successful. I?ôve seen services claim over a 90% edge. That is rare, or perhaps impossible as markets are dynamic.""It's therefore incumbent on any trader interested in a paid group to be careful when selecting one of the many now available, while Wilday and Gilburt also affirm that individual traders always need to take responsibility for themselves and their own trading decisions.Still, even with the existence of more trustworthy groups, Julian Hosp says that in most cases traders would be better off simply following a free group. ?úI would definitely rather take free content,??he says. ?úI?ôm not against buying a course that?ôs reasonably priced, for example. But in general, all the information is out there for free.?ùBut while some groups are more reputable and provide subscribers with training, this doesn't eradicate the suspicion that some are signal groups that use their subscribers to pump an asset their founders or organizers have previously bought. However, despite fears over such groups, Wilday and Gilburt believe that they're actually in the minority. On the other hand, Julian Hosp believes that most of them essentially are 'pump-and-dump' groups.Because of such divergences, the individual trader needs, as ever, to do her own research, since she?ôs the only one she can ever really trust.____Read more:

","Lawyers for under-fire stablecoin Tether (USDT) confirm the token is not backed 100% by cash reserves, but say that it is not obliged to back its token 1:1 with fiat ??sentiments that the market appears to agree with.","At the time of writing (08:36 UTC,) tether still trades above 1 USD. As previously reported, Letitia James, the Attorney General (AG) of the State of New York has taken out a court order against Tether, the Bitfinex exchange and iFinex, the Hong Kong-based company that operates both.The AG has alleged that Bitfinex ?úengaged in a cover-up to hide the apparent loss of USD 851 million dollars of co-mingled client and corporate funds,??and that the exchange had ?úgiven itself access??to Tether cash reserves that were put aside to underpin Tether tokens.Tether?ôs lawyers have hit back at the AG?ôs move, with legal firms Morgan, Lewis & Bockuis and Steptoe & Johnson issuing a memorandum of law to a New York court. The document makes the following claims: Stuart Hoegner, Bitfinex?ôs General Counsel and a lawyer specializing in cryptocurrency-related matters, has also filed an affidavit with a New York court in which he admits,?úTether has cash and cash equivalents (short-term securities) on hand totaling approximately USD 2.1 billion, representing approximately 74% of the current outstanding tethers.?ùHowever, the company also has ?úadditional reserves??though ?úless liquid??assets, Hoegner said without specifying.Meanwhile, the Tether's website claims that the excess of their assets over liabilities stands at almost USD 23 million. Hoegner also notes, that Federal Reserve rulings only require American banks to keep cash reserves ?úrepresenting, at most, only 10% of their liabilities????indicating that the AG appears to be holding Tether up to impossible standards.The strongly worded document also claims that liquidity is no problem for Tether, stating,?úBetween December 2018 and April 29, 2019, the average daily fiat redemption has been USD 566,066.00, with the largest being USD 24.2 million. The vast majority of [fiat] redemption requests of Tether are for less than USD 1 million.?ùMeanwhile, another attorney representing Tether, Zoe Phillips of Morgan, Lewis & Bockuis, said in a separate document that ""the Attorney General appears to believe that Tether must hold USD 1 in cash fiat currency for every dollar of tether. These allegations are wrong on multiple levels.""""More fundamentally, the Attorney General has no authority to dictate how Bitfinex and Tether do business with one another, or the amount of reserves that Tether must hold,"" she stressed, adding that any tether holder dissatisfied with the current arrangement that tether is not fully backed by cash could have freely redeemed his or her tethers for cash, or exchanged their tether for another virtual currency, and can still do so today.USDT transaction count and price (7 days average):Furthermore, Hoegner stated that the AG?ôs injunction was ?úneedlessly disruptive??to Bitfinex, contained incorrect allegations about the company?ôs dealings with Panama-based company Crypto Capital ??and has succeeded in ?úspreading misinformation to the markets.?ùHowever, the Attorney General said last week that Bitfinex lied to its customers when it claimed that ""all cryptocurrency and fiat withdrawals are and have been processing as usual without the slightest interference"" in October 2018.
_____It's $crypto - when has lying and defrauding investors not been the status quo?I'm sorry, but they straight up lied and decided the market. It's not okay and it only came out via the courts, meaning why should we assume this is the sum of all malfeasance (which today's news contradicts)As per my prev. post on Apr 25Reminds me of the Big Short. Defaults and big housing mortgage brokers going under ... rating agencies NOT downgrading the Banks ... market NOT moving.  Everyone sitting back scratching their heads thinking holy shit this whole market is rigged...We all knew it would happen but the irony is all the things people were acusing only actually happened in Oct 18 once they became too big to maintain banking. Yes there are certainly AML issues but Tether played an integral role in the industry until we could get USDC, PAX, etctether is currently 74% backed by cash assets and 26% bitfinex shares. (based on loan doc)so cash value of said assets aside . The concern should be BFX ability to stay operational,pay back the loan,to raise capital to lower the debt( shares) or recovery of confiscated funds pic.twitter.com/nsFRV9xWw5Network effect doesn't explain it because there's no upside above $1. Either the market irrational or it considers the Bitfinex IOU to be good enough collateral.Yes, they could create the illusion that the consensus is that the peg will hold, and, with hundreds of millions they could do so for a while. But that only works if the market is irrational.Interestingly, Tether rather than Dai is proving the demand and value of an unregulated stablecoin. *That* is why it is maintaining its peg.If that happened that would be a scenario where governments allow Tether to gain legitimate banking powers. The power to print money for private profits.... as well as a (potentially unrecoverable) Schrodinger?ôs Cat-style chunk of deposits... a lack of alternatives... and a set of a handful artificial frictions.7) My next favorite: ""The deal was negotiated on an arm's length basis with 'independent counsel.'"" Big time red flag -WHY- because the same guy #GiancarloDevasini signed for both Bitfinex/Tether! Good job catching that @Bitfinexed - That's coming out in the next brief. pic.twitter.com/X1uafRx36MTether premium is decreasing even after the confirmation that Tether only holds 74% of cash on hand. From about 1.3% yesterday, it is now just 0.7%. Bitfinex premium decreased a bit too (but is still large) from 6.3% yesterday to 5.8% now. pic.twitter.com/OXUx9nx0mVThe address distribution matters. If exchanges and large usdt brokers collectively own 25% of supply, if every usdt gets redeemed they'd become bitfinex shareholders solely. There's likely a mutual socialization agreement there.Same is not true for claims on fiat at bfx. https://t.co/8Sp8ASvssuFear inducing headline:?úOnly 74% of #Tether is backed by cash and equivalents?ò±?ùThe truth: Your bank would collapse if everyone tried to withdraw, they have nowhere near 74% liquidity.Calm down people. Buy Bitcoin.Indeed. However, in its present form Fractional Reserve Banking works well as banks can rely on a lender of last resort. Furthermore, for banks, ALM (asset liability management) is crucial, and banks devote extensive resources in hedging asset-liability mismatches.Price is there because of traders' activities. It doesn't have to make sense.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

","After a rumor broke out yesterday that Ripple, a California-based crypto startup focusing on the banking sector, has acquired the major U.S.-based money transfer company MoneyGram, both companies refused to comment. Both have stated that they do not comment on speculations and rumors as a rule, but should there be any official news, they?ôd let the public now. ","The rumor started with a post on Twitter by a trader called CryptHawk, who claims that Ripple has indeed acquired MoneyGram, referring to a ""trusted source"". According to the anonymous trader, the negations for the acquisition were ongoing since November 2018 and that the deal has finally been signed this past Monday.In either case, MoneyGram, which was founded in 1940, was on sale recently as it's trying to deal with falling revenues and restructure its debt pile, which reportedly totaled USD 902.8 million as of the end of September 2018 and comes due next year. According to Reuters, the USD 1.2 billion deal with Ant Financial, owned by Jack Ma, the executive chairman of Chinese giant Alibaba Group Holding and other Alibaba executives, fell through in January, 2018, after a U.S. government panel rejected it due to national security concerns. In a deal with Ant Financial, the company would be sold for USD 18 per share, or more than USD 1 billion. Now, its share price in the market stands at USD 1.41, while its market capitalization is USD 83.5 million, compared with the average market capitalization of USD 501.74 million in the last five years. While the company has been working on meeting the terms of their agreements, fulfilling their obligations, and paying off the debts, Reuters' source said earlier this year ""that a sale of the company is not certain.""Meanwhile, Ripple does not disclose its financials, only revealing sales of XRP, their native token, each quarter. For example, in Q1 2019, Ripple sold XRP worth USD 169 million.For Ripple, founded in 2012, acquisition of MoneyGram would be a huge thing, not to even mention the number of people they could reach and offer their services to. According to their website, MoneyGram operates in more than 200 countries and territories around the world, whether online, with services available through a mobile device, at a kiosk, or in local shops. However, just last month, Ripple partnered with MoneyGram's competitor, money transfer company Ria Money Transfer, a subsidiary of payment service provider Euronet Worldwide, in order to help Ria ?úsettle transactions with increased speed, transparency and efficiency and deliver a better experience to their customers.??XRP, the native token of Ripple, is down by almost 1% in the past 24 hours and by more than 14% in the past week.In the meantime, waiting to see if the rumor is true or not, while some imagine what would this news would mean for their wallets.Oh we wish ?òÇ?òÇ?òÇ?òÇOthers are warning against spreading rumors until a news is confirmed.""Seems like it's out""? Where?You know how harmful this is going to be when your 'insider knowledge' turns out to be bogus, right?I sincerely hope you're not making this up.And are extremely distrustful of the anonymous source on Twitter.@TheCryptHawk has been directly associated with aggressive scams in the past.I'd trust my long-term professional career to a Mexican drug cartel before trusting any information coming from this account.The rest prefer to wait and see.No need to answer everybody, if your information is true you ll be the winner otherwise your reputability will be done.Time will tell",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

","In response to a call to ban crypto in the US, former US Congressman, former Presidential candidate, and Bitcoin supporter, Ron Paul stated that such a ban is highly unlikely, but also that US dollar is going to self-destruct.","As reported, on May 9th, US Congress Representative Brad Sherman called for a bill which would ?úoutlaw cryptocurrency purchases by Americans so that we nip this in the bud?? claiming that digital tokens  aim to destabilize and disempower the country?ôs foreign policy, its tax collection enforcement, and the traditional law enforcement, among many other things.According to Paul, Sherman is speaking ?úfor the deep state establishment, military people and everyone else in the banking system,??Bitcoin Magazine reported. Rep. Brad Sherman?ôs top contributors for the 2017 - 2018 election cycle were related to traditional financial services companies, such as Royal Business Bank, Capital Group Companies, Northrop Grumman, Allied Wallet, and UBS AG.Paul then added that Sherman is ?úrepresenting their position that ?úYou don?ôt mess with the dollar.??But I don?ôt worry about that because the dollar is going to self-destruct.??Indeed, in his 2009 book ?òEnd the FED,??Ron Paul referred to the dollar as a ticking time bomb and has now added that ?úI just want to make sure that there?ôs allowed to be a hedge. [?? And the trust in the dollar has allowed the bubble to get bigger. It?ôs held together for a long time and that?ôs just going to make the crash worse.?ùBut what if dollar does indeed loses its value, what would replace it? Paul believes that alternative currencies and ideas ""might help solve the problems we have,"" adding: ""I think that?ôs what bitcoin offers: an alternative. I want a free marketplace.??He finds that the digital currencies will follow the same economic laws as fiat, ?úbut there is going to be a subjective element to it.??However, despite his political foundation accepts bitcoin, Pol claims he doesn't own this cryptocurrency.The fact is, Paul maintains, that all currencies are volatile, including dollar. However, ?úthe more successful that cryptos are, the more the government will get involved,??he adds. This success worries people like Sherman, because ?úthey know what is going on. His reaction, his emotions are his belief, because he can see what could happen to the Federal Reserve?ôs monopoly over the monetary system. You can?ôt allow people to talk about using alternative currencies. Usually, we punish people for that,??according to Bitcoin Magazine.Meanwhile, the number of major investors and companies that are supporting crypto is increasing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

","Justin Sun, founder of Tron (TRX), won the Warren Buffett charity lunch auction using money of BitTorrent, which ""has nothing to do with cryptocurrency.""","""We paid from the BitTorrent [income], which is our company based in San Francisco. Most of the money is related to our ads revenue from the BitTorrent clients and it has nothing to do with cryptocurrency,"" Sun, who is also the CEO of BitTorrent, said in an interview with Yahoo Finance. Tron acquired BitTorrent for reportedly USD 140 million in 2018 and in 2019 both companies launched the BitTorrent token (BTT) in an attempt to tokenize popular file sharing protocol.As reported earlier in June, the winning bid of USD 4.57 million is one-third higher that the previous record and, a usual, will benefit the Glide Foundation, a charity in San Francisco√¢?¨‚Ñ¢s Tenderloin district that serves the poor, homeless or those battling substance abuse.The Tron Founder said yesterday that the date and location of the lunch have been confirmed but did not reveal more details.  According to previous reports, the lunch should take place at the Smith & Wollensky steakhouse in midtown Manhattan. Also, Justin Sun is yet to announce other seven participants who will join him in the meeting with one of the richest man in the world, prominent investor, who once called Bitcoin ""probably rat poison squared"" and recently said that it's ""a gambling device"". Meanwhile, in the interview with Yahoo Finance, Sun also said that ""it might be unrealistic to convince Warren Buffett, just in three hours, to buy cryptocurrencies."" According to the Tron founder, they want to show Buffett the recent progress of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.He also said he has made ""lots of money"" by using Buffett's value investing strategy.""I was an investor in the stock market for a long time and we'll find a lot of things in common between cryptocurrency and stocks,"" Sun added.Previously, he pointed out that ""even one of the most successful investors of all times can sometimes miss a coming wave,"" reminding that Buffett has admitted he overpaid for a big investment food giant Kraft Heinz Co., while failing to realize the potential of the likes of Amazon.com Inc., Google and Apple.

According to McAfee, the idea is to detach the coin from the ?úfear, greed, manipulation and the vagaries of external economic conditions.?ùWhile it is still unclear how the whole concept is supposed to work, the further details shall be clarified in the Freedom Coin's whitepaper which should be released later.The most sensible view is that the ?úMcAfee Freedom Coin??will be available for transactions directly between user wallets, but not cryptocurrency exchanges so that its value in relation to other currencies would remain non-existent.The initial announcement also included a now-retracted message:?úNo it is is not mined. No, we are not doing an ICO. No, we are not looking for investors. No, we will not be listed on an exchange. No, we will give no more information before release of white paper.

Accidently deleted:THE MCAFEE FREEDOM COIN:https://t.co/FfROeByhKnThere are many original crypto projects in the space, but McAfee?ôs new coin is unique in a way how it will try to remove the currency exchange market from its ecosystem and will rely on private sales or peer-to-peer platforms alone.Private sales are unrestricted. It is organized exchanges that will not be able to play. A private sale does not make a market. Buy gold, diamonds, bonds, stocks - even dollars - we don't care. But an exchange market for anything whatsoever cannot be done.Also, there are many cryptocurrencies that are not traded on cryptocurrency exchanges, so it's difficult to argue that such a project will create some unique value without introducing some kind unique breakthrough innovation. Besides, it is likely to have value in relation to other currencies, even if that value is not public.  Moreover, the entrepreneur has also announced recently that he's going to launch a privacy-focused ""Visa/Mastercard Crypto Debit Card,"" which is reportedly being already tested.Previously, McAfee made the headlines when he promised to reveal the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto but did not do so due to his imminent extradition request to the United States.

The exchange, which was placed into liquidation this week, said in the related FAQ announcement that even if the funds were not affected by the January hack, until the investigation is complete, they can't return any crypto-assets to customers, or confirm whether individual customers will get all of their crypto-assets returned.""The hack earlier this year contributed to the issues which led to the liquidation, the current halt to trading affects the entire Cryptopia exchange,"" the company explained. In February, it estimated that ""worst case 9.4% of our total holdings was stolen."" The document states that ?úwe are now undertaking an extensive process to confirm amounts owing and available to return to customers?? the priority being ?úto secure all crypto-assets at Cryptopia.??However, the FAQ also makes it clear that the investigation will likely take months.Also, the answers provided by the FAQ include that the trading will most likely not resume, that the exchange will not ask for any crypto-assets or confirmation of user details, that it?ôs not possible to confirm any customer balances until the investigation is over, and that it remains unknown when the funds will be returned to the customers, if they?ôll be returned as crypto assets or fiat currency, or if they?ôll be returned at all. No withdrawals will be allowed even if coins are deposited accidentally. In regards to that, the document also states that ?úAt this stage there is no intention to reopen trading on the exchange. Please do not deposit any further coins with Cryptopia?? and the exchange tweeted two days ago, warning people: ?úPLEASE DO NOT SEND ANY DEPOSITS TO CRYPTOPIA.??The post led to a number of debates over Cryptopia?ôs response to the situation, their intentions (including theories of theft), and the future of people?ôs coins.

","When Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao first realized that the exchange had been hacked, and plenty of funds stolen on May 7, his first thought was ?úF***!?? His second thought was quite different: ?úF***!!?? while the third one, and you?ôll never guess it, was: ?úF***!!!??","A cybersecurity incident that results in the theft of BTC 7,000 (USD 40 million at the time) is no laughing matter, and CZ took the time to look back at the past two weeks and share what he now knows had happened, how the company and the community reacted, and which lessons were learned in the process.According to the CEO, these were the questions that he had to deal with:""After 10 seconds of the 'F***, F***, F***' state, I did a quick mental calculation. 7000 BTC, fine, I know we have more than that in our own BTC funds alone. There is enough. A second calculation eased my mind, this was about the same as a quarterly burn we did about a year ago, not 'such a big deal,'"" according to the CEO.CZ stressed out on multiple occasions that transparency and constant communication helped them decrease potential damage to their reputation: ""Get on a live video stream during crises. Your users deserve to know, not just what happened, but what you are doing to handle it, including allowing them to judge your mental state for themselves.""""In the world of technology, you can never accurately estimate how long changes might take. It is quite different when you compare it to repeated, predictable work. Regardless, our users and community needed an estimate, and once communicated, it became a target deadline for our team to deliver,"" the CEO said, referring to the decision to suspend withdrawals and deposits for a week. They were resumed last Wednesday, one day later than estimated.  The CEO also mentioned the ?úWar Mode??everyone switched into. That mode includes a few things, among which is the honest, upfront approach he and his team have had towards the whole situation, as well as the support he, as the frontman, has gotten from his peers. ?úTo bring the system back online within one week, all of our teams did more than a quarter?ôs worth of work in that one week,??he said.Ikea beds were set up, so it was basically a ?úNo Sleep Till Brooklyn??scenario at the headquarters.CZ praised the amount of scrutiny he faced during a livestream, even saying that the body language analysis he was put through was a ?úvery good thing??He also said that between the wholehearted support the company received from the community, as well as law enforcement agencies, the company had gotten plenty of business offers, which he describes as ill-timed.?úThough some clearly intended to help, many were simply trying to sell their services. While all help is fully appreciated, the timing was actually a little off,??he says.

""Before the AMA, I had been up all night and I was really feeling the effects. So, I took a 15-minute nap just before the AMA. Upon waking up, my team told me there was an interesting proposal from a Bitcoin Core developer. I read it for a few seconds. It involved something called a ?úreorg?? While I know it?ôs technically possible for a rollback in a 51% attack scenario, it never occurred to me that it is also technically possible to change one transaction and keep all other transactions intact, while hugely incentivizing the miners. The discussion was already pretty hot on Twitter, so I mentioned it in the AMA as something that was suggested. Little did I know, it was a taboo topic. Lesson learned,"" the CEO said.

","The competition among major exchange tokens is heating up, as UNUS SED LEO (LEO), the recently-issued Bitfinex exchange token, has reached USD 1.5 billion market capitalization in less than two weeks and is inching closer to the top 10 coins by market capitalization as it is already ranked as the 13th largest coin. ","In comparison, it took around six months for Binance Coin (BNB), the native token of another major crypto exchange Binance, to reach USD 1.5 billion capitalization and it took another few months to enter the list of the top 20 coins in March 2018. Then, it fluctuated in and out of the list for months before continuing its climb towards top 10. Now, its market capitalization stands at USD 4.29 billion and BNB ranks as the 7th largest cryptocurrency in the whole market.Now, LEO and BNB are the two largest exchange tokens by market capitalization. Exchange tokens on June 5:__However, starting positions of both coins were different, which also explains the LEO's spurt.LEO chart:__
BNB chart:At first glance, the key difference between the leading exchange tokens is the amounts raised in their funding stages. LEO private sale has helped to raise USD 1 billion from private investors in May 2019, while Binance raised USD 15 million during its initial coin offering (ICO) in July 2017.Besides, during the ICO, one BNB token was sold for USD 0.10, while LEO tokens were initially valued at 1 USD per unit. Moreover, circulating supply of LEO is 1 billion, while there are 141 million of BNBs in circulation.  Both tokens have similar use cases and incentive mechanisms - they can be used for trading discounts and initial exchange offerings (IEOs). Fore example, on June 5, Bitfinex announced that LEO holders with more than 5,000 USDt in LEO will have their taker fees reduced by an additional 10% across all crypto-to-crypto pairs and that ""a number of additional UNUS SED LEO fee benefits will go live over the coming weeks."" Also, supply of both LEO and BNB is deflating through token burns, which is compared by some to equity buybacks.1/ I see LEO is building up quite the hype on CT, and rightly so.  It's very different to every other coin or ico b/c the end-goal is not to ""dump on retail"" but rather to sell to bitfinex, via the burn. (which starts today and goes on forever until there is one LEO remaining)However, LEO burns are set to happen at a faster pace. As per LEO whitepaper, LEO token burn will occur on a monthly basis and will be equal to a minimum of 27% of the consolidated gross revenues of iFinex (excluding the Ethfinex exchange) (iFinex is the operator of Bitfinex and EthFinex) from the previous month. In addition, the company aims to use funds recovered from Crypto Capital and net funds recovered from Bitfinex hack in 2016 to repurchase and burn outstanding LEO tokens.According to unaudited reports, iFinex profit last year was USD 404 million.It is estimated that a single quarterly burn would be worth a minimum USD 28 million worth of LEO. In comparison, the average BNB token burn was worth c. USD 22 million in 2018, while the first burn in 2019 was worth USD 15.6 million.However, while LEO appreciates in value, Bitfinex and Tether, which is also controlled by the same people as Bitfinex, are still in a legal fight against New York Attorney General (NYAG) and are facing market backlash for changing the terms and conditions of USDT, of which only 74% were recently backed with cash and cash equivalent.

","In the relentless effort to utilize the blockchain technology, the new company called Fnality International, a brainchild of 14 major financial firms, is estimated to become operational in 2020. The company will be in control of a blockchain-powered digital cash system and of a token called ?òutility settlement coin??(USC), according to the Wall Street Journal (WSJ).","The report states that USC will be used for payment and as a device that transmits all the necessary data to complete a trade. What this involves and how it will function exactly remains to be seen.Already in September 2015, UBS Group, a Swiss financial giant, partnered with the London-based blockchain company Clearmatics. They?ôve launched the concept of a digital cash system that would allow financial markets to make payments and settle transactions in a quicker and safer manner via blockchain technology. As Reuters reported in August 2017, the group of six major banks led by UBS have joined the project. The Wall Street Journal, however, reports today that, a few years after the story has started going around, it is 14 companies that have invested USD 63.2 million in Fnality International, including Lloyds Banking Group, ING, Nasdaq, Credit Suisse Group, Barclays, and Banco Santander, all led by UBS Group AG, in addition to the firms who?ôve agreed to use USC, such as Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, State Street Bank & Trust Co., Bank of New York Mellon Corp., Mitsubishi UFG Financial Group Inc., Commerzbank, KBC Group, and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp.How the final list will look like and how many more companies will join in support of this new token and system also remains to be seen, but the platform is expected to be operational in 2020, according to the WSJ and an earlier report by Reuters. Supposedly, the main purpose of the blockchain system remains the same: to allow faster and safer trades on a global level. ?úYou remove settlement risk, the counterparty risk, the market risk,??Hyder Jaffrey, UBS investment strategy head, told the WSJ. ?úAll of those risks add up to costs and inefficiencies in the marketplace.??Also, earlier in May, Reuters reported that the banks had been in discussion with central banks and regulators as a group to make sure that their project was compliant with the rules and regulations.Meanwhile, as reported, another banking giant, U.S.-based JPMorgan created JPM Coin to instantly settle payments between institutional clients.

","The most popular crypto market data provider, CoinMarketCap gave 45 days deadline to all exchanges, listed on the website, to provide additional data in an attempt to address the fake trading volume problem.","Now, exchanges are obliged to additionally send live trading and live order book data, the company announced on Wednesday, when it celebrates its 6th birthday.""These data points will enable analyses to determine measures such as liquidity, order book depth, spreads, and other meaningful measures.

The changes will go into effect in 45 days, starting June 14.The list of exchanges, ranked by adjusted volume, includes almost 150 entities that already provide the new required data, while there are more than 100 exchanges that risk to be excluded from the list.Around 95% of trading volume on Coinmarketcap is fake and/or non-economic in nature, crypto investment company Bitwise Asset Management said in March. However, exchanges engaging in wash trading actually follow a predictable pattern so they can be exposed by any trader, as previously reported.  In a recent interview with Cryptonews.com, one of the main competitors of CoinMarketCap, CoinGecko, also said that they're planning to provide more data in the coming weeks and months that might help better evaluate exchanges.Meanwhile, during the next phases, CoinMarketCap is planning to add even more data available for analysis and enable filtering to allow deeper analyses and views into the exchanges√¢?¨‚Ñ¢ operations.

","As the battle of the blockchain protocols heats up, developers, investors and dapp (decentralized application) users are trying to figure out which of the industry players might win the race. ","Cryptoasset research firm Bitassist in collaboration with cryptocurrency data analytics firm Omenics took a closer look at the current state of the four major competitors - Ethereum, EOS, Tron, and Tezos.""While Ethereum dominates as the most decentralised platform, its limited throughput has stunted further dapp activity. What EOS gains in performance capability, it loses in decentralization. Tezos√¢?¨‚Ñ¢ novel governance model has shown strong community ownership of the future of the code base. Tron, while owned by a private company, is the second most distributed platform by node count, second only to Ethereum,"" concluded James Benett, director and co-founder of Bitassist.Among other things, this is what they have compared:""EOS currently has the highest throughput among the four protocols, boasting capacity of up to 4,000 TPS. It is important to note that this number reflects the upper limit rather than the day-to-day reality. With a limited number of dapps and users across the platform the highest required throughput is 80 TPS.""""Ethereum stands out as the most decentralized platform in the group with no single entity responsible for updates to the core code and also no formal option for transaction reversals. <...> Tezos can be considered the second most decentralized platform among the protocols, requiring a minimum of 80% of all stake coins to reach consensus on appending the blockchain. Similar to Ethereum and EOS, Tezos' core code is owned by a foundation rather than a private entity. While Tron may be one of the more distributed platforms it is also the most centralized from a governance point of view. With a private entity owning the Tron platform, there is significant lobbying power than can be cast over block producers.""""A good measure of the distribution of a network is the number and location of the nodes or block producers actively supporting the public blockchain protocol. Network distribution is extremely important when it comes to censorship resistance.<...> The greater the geographic dispersion of nodes, the more resilient it is to state-sponsored attacks and the more valuable the network is an independent database. <...> We also need to consider the number of nodes in the context of the protocol's consensus mechanism. It should not come as a surprise to readers that a Proof of Work blockchain has the highest number of nodes since the network relies directly on the competition between miners' computing power.""30 day moving average ""While Ethereum retains the highest numers of DAU's today, the flagship protocol has been losing ground to its competitors since February 2018. EOS narrowly leads Tron in active users by just 2.3k, with both chasers sitting around 60k active addresses per day, approximately 22% of Ethereum's activity.""""The relevant data is not available for the Tezos platform, however, based on their current TPS capacity we can estimate that they sit somewhere between Tron and Ethereum. The key takeaway from the transaction count data is that Ethereum's economic activity is currently limited by its TPS throughput. During period of high demand, the flagship protocol consistently reached 100% of it available transaction throughput.""""The chart above compares three metrics. The x-axis shows the total number of dapps, the y-axis shows the percentage of total on-chain activity relating to dapps and the volume of the bubble represents the total number of transactions. As the newest of the protocols, Tezos dapp activity remains difficult to obtain and is excluded from analysis. 
Ethereum has a significant lead in terms of number of dapps with 2,2486 as of May 2019. Tron and EOS are in close competition, with Tron leading in total number of dapps by 295 to 271. What EOS lacks in dapps is certainly makes up for in dapp transaction volume with 1.4 million transactions over a 24 hours period or around 28% of the platforms total volume. The Tron protocol has the highest percentage of on-chain transactions being used in dapps, with 50% of its 947k transactions over a 24 hours period being used in dapps. Ethereum has the lowest total dapp transactions of the three, competing just 90,9K over the 24 hours period.""""EOS, ETH and Tron have the highest news sentiment correlation among the protocols. This result is likely driven by EOS and ETH commonly being referenced withing the same news articles. Tezos has shown the lowest correlation with respect to the other protocols, suggesting that news broadcasts often mention Tezos independently of its competition.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

","The new software is available for the Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems, and it comes with a Web 3.0 explorer, thanks to which users are able to explore, conduct transactions, and interact with the blockchain-based dapps. According to the blog post, the built-in crypto wallet enables users to send transactions without needing to install a browser plugin first, such as MetaMask.In order to improve privacy and security, Opera provides a virtual private network (VPN) with a goal to establish an encrypted tunnel that protects users??data from third parties and hides their geographical locations. Furthermore, the wallet keys stay in their respective user?ôs smartphones because the built-in wallet syncs with the one provided by Opera?ôs mobile Android browser.

This time, it's French giant Societe Generale Group (SocGen.)","In April, Societe Generale SFH, a subsidiary of SocGen, sold EUR 100 million, or USD 112 million, of covered bonds (debt backed by mortgages) in the form of digital tokens ??to itself. This could be huge news for digital assets. The bond was issued as a security token on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain, and earned the highest credit rating from Moody?ôs Investors Service and Fitch Ratings, according to SocGen. The company is one of Europe's largest financial services organizations, with almost USD 2 trillion in assets, and 31 million customers in 67 countries.Societe Generale FORGE, an internal startup launched through the bank?ôs intrapreneurship program, the Internal Startup Call, used this transaction in order to test if and how the crypto technology can be utilized for a more efficient way to issue bonds, to cut costs, improve product scalability, reduce time to market, and speed settlement for the securities. ""This startup experiments disruptive business solutions using blockchain technology to develop new digital capital market activities,??SocGen said.Even though traditional finance firms are mostly mistrustful of digital tokens, crypto evangelists predict a wider use of security tokens offerings (STO). On the other hand, to the sceptics, STOs are just a way to inflate the crypto bubble. ?úThe proliferation of tokenization within finance will occur, but don?ôt expect to see it go mainstream anytime soon,??Romal Almazo, who leads the crypto and blockchain practice at Capco, a financial-technology consultancy, told Bloomberg.   As reported, the STO market is estimated to grow this year, but at a steady rate - and the explosion might come some time until 2021, according to Carlos Domingo, founder and CEO of security token platform Securitize. Richard Kemmish, the former head of covered bond origination at Credit Suisse Group AG, in an interview with Bloomberg asked ""whether we are really ready for this"":""One of the things that SocGen seem to have emphasized is improving settlement and clearing, but I?ôm not really sure how much of a problem or expense they are actually avoiding.?ô‚ÄôIn either case, SocGen is no stranger to crypto-related projects. On April 18th, they?ôve made an announcement that their we.trade, a blockchain-based trade finance platform, is now available to their clients in France. The bank calls it ?úthe most advanced platform for digitalizing, securing and financing corporate trades?? which was produced in collaboration with tech giant IBM.Furthermore, last September, SocGen was a part of the joint venture established by fifteen international financing, trading, and production institutions, called komgo SA, developed in partnership with the Ethereum-focused blockchain software technology company ConsenSys. The new platform is based in Geneva, Switzerland and aims to digitalize trade and commodities finance processes, while improving transparency and reducing the risk of fraud.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

",Bitfinex operator iFinex has made some new financial claims in the white paper for its forthcoming initial exchange offering (IEO) ??stating that its platform made a whopping USD 404 million in net profits last year (24% more than in 2017) and paid dividends while they are still struggling to recover allegedly lost USD 851 million.,"iFinex, Bitfinex and the company?ôs stablecoin Tether are still embroiled in a complex legal battle with the Attorney General (AG) in New York. The AG has accused the operator of ?úcovering up??loans and ?úmisappropriating??some USD 851 million ??in a case that involves a Panamanian company, Crypto Capital.As reported earlier this week, Bitfinex has already stated that it wants to raise USD 1 billion through the forthcoming release of its LEO token.And in the white paper, Bitfinex appears to flex its financial muscles, stating that its gross profits for 2018, including consolidated revenue, stood at over USD 418 million. The company also claimed that it paid shareholders dividends of USD 261.7 million last year, or 6% more than in 2017. In comparison, another major and recently hacked exchange, Binance, reportedly made USD 446 million in profits in 2018.However, these startling claims by Bitfinex may possibly need to be taken with a pinch of salt. The company admits,?úFinancial data [is] unaudited and has been derived from our accounting records, but have not been prepared in accordance with the generally accepted accounting principles of any jurisdiction.?ùInstead, the operator says, its financial information ?úis presented in accordance with principles, and reflects all adjustments necessary in the view of iFinex.?ùSome other financial claims made in the white paper include:iFinex has also outlined its plans for the loan money that it says it will shortly recoup from Crypto Capital, stating,??iFinex] will use an amount equal to 95% of the recovered net funds from Crypto Capital to redeem and burn a corresponding amount of outstanding LEO tokens. Net recoveries will be calculated by iFinex in good faith and will be net of legal costs, operational and recovery costs, governmental charges and reserves for contingent costs.?ùThe document also goes on to explain what iFinex says is the nature of its relationship with the Panamanian company, stating that it ?ústrengthened its relationship with Crypto Capital in the immediate aftermath of a service disruption initiated by an American correspondent bank.?ùiFinex says that in late summer last year, the government ?úpartially??seized Crypto Capital funds, after which the Bitfinex operator granted the Panamanian company a ?úsecured, revolving line of credit on commercially reasonable terms.?ùThe document adds,?úBitFinex is actively working in various jurisdictions around the world to expedite the return of these funds, and is confident in the future success of these efforts, although there is no certainty that BitFinex will be able to recover these funds.?ùiFinex executives are due to appear in court in New York later this month to face the AG?ôs charges.Meanwhile, Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin opined, per Bloomberg, that the Bitfinex/Tether situation ?úseems like a really big mess that probably won?ôt get better.?ùHowever, Lubin also stated that he was hopeful of seeing a silver lining. He remarked, ?úThere are other price-stable tokens out there ??many others ??and I think they?ôre going to gain traction because of this. I think that will be a really good thing.?ùIn either case, tether still trades above USD 1, while the risk premium on Bitfinex decreased: recently, bitcoin was trading at around USD 300 premium on the exchange and today it's around USD 70.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

","Blockchain adoption continues apace, but a report from researcher Gartner claims that 90% of already-implemented business blockchain platform solutions ?úwill require replacement within 18 months to remain competitive, secure and avoid obsolescence.??,The researcher believes that the sector will continue to expand", and states that ?úthe business value added by blockchain will grow??to over USD 176 billion by 2025, and ?úexceed USD 3.1 trillion by 2030.?ùHowever, per a press release from Gartner, the company?ôs senior research director Adrian Lee issued a word of warning, stating, ?úMany [chief information officers] overestimate the capabilities and short-term benefits of blockchain as a technology to help them achieve their business goals, thus creating unrealistic expectations when assessing offerings from blockchain platform vendors and service providers.?ùAccording to Gartner, today, the blockchain platform market is composed of fragmented offerings that often overlap or are being used in a complementary fashion, making technology choices confusing for IT decision makers.?úCompounding this challenge is the fact that blockchain platform vendors typically use messaging that does not link to a target buyer?ôs use cases and business benefits. For example, ?òtransactions??was the term mentioned the most in relation to blockchain, followed by ?òsecure??and ?òsecurity.??While these may be functions of blockchain-enabling technology, buyers are still confused as to how these functions are achieved or what benefits blockchain adds compared to their existing processes,"??said Lee.The company does not expect there to be a single dominant blockchain platform within the next five years: """"Instead"," we expect a multiplatform world to emerge.""""Regardless", many companies and major governments believe that they need to steal a march on their rivals when it comes to blockchain adoption ??with many insisting that IT races are rarely won by overly-cautious companies and organizations.Meanwhile, in South Korea, the government says it will use blockchain-powered solutions to catch benefits cheats. According to South Korean media outlet BC Post, the Ministry of Health and Welfare will conduct a research project over the next five months, with a budget of over USD 42,000 ??looking for ways to use the technology to put an end to benefit fraud.The ministry believes that blockchain solutions could help it fight back against fraudsters who copy details from people claiming disability benefits in order to receive government payouts. The ministry says fraud is an increasing problem, and that welfare bills shot up by 10% in 2018.Elsewhere, CNews reports that three of South Korea?ôs biggest energy companies ??the Korea Power Exchange, Nambu Electric Power and the Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO) ??have agreed to work together on a public blockchain pilot project for the issuance of renewable energy supply certificates (RECs).The companies say the solution will help ensure South Korean companies and individuals cannot make fraudulent or misleading claims about the nature of their energy resources.Previously, some of the country?ôs top conglomerates, banks and shipbuilding companies have announced that they are turning to blockchain technology," with many keen to commercialize blockchain products beginning in the second half of this year.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

",New details have emerged showing how some well known players of the cryptoverse are doing. ,"News outlet The Information reported, citing undisclosed sources familiar with the matter, that ConsenSys is looking to raise USD 200. It also added that the company, which focuses on developing solutions using the Ethereum blockchain, has brought in USD 21 million in revenue in 2018 and is projecting a revenue of USD 50 million this year, according to the report. 80% of the revenue should come from its service business with large-scale clients, while the remainder should come from software products. The unnamed sources further allege that the company is looking for a valuation of USD 1 billion, considered unattainable by a number of their would-be investors.Only in December last year, ConsenSys announced their intent to restructure the organization by shifting it into a new phase ?úfor greater efficiency, accountability, and attention to revenue,??along with expecting projects under its umbrella to follow suit. These restructuring efforts were accompanied by layoffs, when a total of 13% of the company?ôs employees found themselves without a job. ??Until now], it has been enough to show up, it has been enough to do something cool, it has been enough to make a splash,??Lubin told news outlet Breaker Mag at the time. The company explained that starting then, underperforming projects will be cut off and projects will be judged on three metrics: revenue or return on investment, benefit to the Ethereum ecosystem, and social good - for which the means of assessment were ?ústill being determined.?ùOne of the major sources for the problems ConsenSys has been having seems to be the bear market of 2018, which caused the Ethereum token to drop sharply. Although the market has since showed signs of recovery, ETH is still far from its all-time high of USD 1,448 in January 2018, currently sitting at USD 163.53 as of the time of writing. This marks a drop of almost 90% - a significant fallback for many Ethereum-focused ConsenSys subsidiaries. ConsenSys declined to comment for this article.Meanwhile, it looks like Binance is growing its quarterly profit again after recording a drop in the third and fourth quarters of 2018. It made USD 78 million in 1Q this year, or 66% more than in 4Q18, but still less than in 1Q18 (-50%,) according to calculations by Cryptonews.com. It's based on quarterly burns of BNB, the native token of Binance. The news was first reported by the The Block. The exchange claims that every quarter it destroys BNB worth of 20% of its profits. In the first quarter this year, they burned BNB 829,888, which is roughly equivalent to USD 15.6 million. However, the company does not specify, whether it's net profit they're referring to.
_____
Binance explains BNB burn:_____""The amount of BNB burned this quarter is about half the amount burned last quarter. But considering BNB has more than tripled in value during these past 3 months, the USD equivalent is significantly higher than last quarter,"" Changpeng Zhao, CEO of Binance, said in a blog post, adding that the price of BNB began to rise before BTC even began to turn around in the market a couple months ago.""This means fewer BNB were spent on trading fees by our users, resulting in lower revenue in BNB, while our revenue denominated in USD rose during this time. Third, with the recent rise in BTC price, we see our revenues in USD terms making a turnaround, too (rising),"" he said. At pixel time, the 24-hour trading volume on Binance stands at more than USD 1 billion. Trading volume on Binance:Meanwhile, Sirin Labs confirmed to Israeli business news outlet Globes that it had recently laid off 15 of its 60 employees.""The company gives some of its work to outsourcing, and plans to focus on development and distribution of the software,"" the report said, citing Sirin Labs that saw disappointing sales of their Finney phone.

","Singapore-headquartered blockchain company Pundi X blames the bear market and long certification process for missed their expansion targets, but claims that their long-term goals remain unchanged. ","The company was not able to ship as many XPOS's - their point of service device that accepts cryptocurrencies - as planned, postponed their XPhone launch, while the date of the public testing of their Function X testnet is not clear now.First, Pundi X shipped only 5,500 units of XPOS out of a target of 50,000. Still, their long-term shipping target of 100,000 shipped devices, set for 2021, remains unchanged, according to their spokesperson.?úSome units are pending because of local certification. Now we've obtained CE [certification which verifies that a device is compliant with EU requirements] and in the process of obtaining more local certifications. Once we finalize the shipment with our partners, we will be able to provide the estimate number for 2019,??the spokesperson told Cryptonews.com.Earlier in April, during the Ask Me Anything session, Zac Cheah, Pundi X founder and CEO, said that they were unable to reach their previous goal due to the bear market and the process of obtaining the necessary certifications. However, according to the CEO, after the certification has been received they will begin to accelerate to get the XPOS compliant with the different markets and increase the activation rate of the XPOS.""<...> we are working hard to engage established global enterprises (especially those) with a large distribution network and footprint. In addition to that, we are exploring the expansion of our XPOS solution footprint by integrating the XPOS into one of the Top 2 point-of-sale manufacturers. We will share the process and details once we have completed the testing,"" Cheah said.The company also claims that XPOS Handy, a more affordable version of XPOS, is now in production and 2,000 units will be produced ""soon.""""The XPOS and XWallet [a mobile app that connects regular digital asset wallets with the Pundi X payment ecosystem] have handled a total of USD 3.9 million in Q1 outbound transaction,"" the CEO said. As or April 10, they had almost 180,000 registered users of XWallet, according to the company.Meanwhile, the company is also at work on their blockchain-based smartphone, called the XPhone, which was initially set to launch in Q2 2019 but has subsequently been moved for the second half of this year. ?úIn late February, we have just finalized specification and price [USD 599]. Testing and detailing are required before we bring the first generation of XPhone to the market,??the spokesperson told us, adding, ?úWe plan to produce 5,000 units of XPhone only. For more XPhone units in the future, we plan to work with phone manufacturers to build the ecosystem together.??Back in February, the company announced a redesign of the phone, which included the X button, allowing users to switch to the dapps (decentralized applications) on the blockchain mode with a press of the button. On the blockchain mode, the services in the XPhone can operate independently of centralized carriers, so that users can route phone calls, messages, and data via blockchain nodes without the need for centralized service providers.As reported, XPOS and XPhones are only a part of Pundi X's plan to build a blockchain with tens of thousands of nodes, as it is developing Function X, ?úa decentralized ecosystem built entirely on and for the blockchain.??In December 2018, the company estimated that the Function X testnet should be available for public testing in Q2 of this year.

","While it?ôs understandable to be wary of new and untested territories, ?úthere are a number of areas where [blockchain] could create value for retail banks,??according to major consulting firm McKinsey and Company.","In the June 2019 article  they claim that while retail banks have been quick to adopt, adapt, and develop digital business models, now being providers of data-based services and mobile banking, they?ôve been very slow in doing the same with blockchain. The authors Matt Higginson, Atakan Hilal, and Erman Yugac explain that: ?úNone of the financial industry?ôs initiatives have been rolled out at scale, and tough regulatory requirements in banking create a high barrier to entry?? adding ?úThe future regulation of blockchain itself remains uncertain.?ùOn the other hand, we?ôve seen investment banks, infrastructure providers, even governments testing the blockchain territory, hoping to increase safety and transparency, while cutting costs. Wholesale banks are partnering with fintechs, launching innovation labs and hackathons, while more than 200 institutions work with the software firm R3 on developing blockchain solutions on an open-source platform. Furthermore, venture-capital funding for blockchains reached USD 1 billion in 2017, the authors of the article say.In his January 2019 article, Higginson wrote that blockchain players, such as Ripple, are ?úincreasingly partnering with non bank payments providers, the businesses of which may be a better fit for blockchain technology. These companies may also be willing to move forward more rapidly with integration.??In the current article, five months later, the authors claim that, overcoming their regulatory concerns, there are some retail banks who have started experimenting with blockchain. One example is Santander?ôs partnership with Ripple in 2018, which resulted in the first blockchain-based money-transfer service, enabling international money transfers in euros and dollars. ?úStill, for the retail banking industry to move forward at scale, further proof of value will likely be required,??the authors state.For example, Germany?ôs central bank president Jens Weidmann said recently that a trial project using blockchain to transfer and settle securities and cash proved more costly and less speedy than the traditional way. However, the prototype ""in principle fulfilled all basic regulatory features for financial transactions.""The authors have discussed three retail use cases ?úthat could eventually be deployed at scale and which offer most in terms of blockchain?ôs three key strengths?îdata handling, disintermediation, and trust.?ùWhile the growing cross-border payments total around USD 600 billion annually, the payment process is ?úclunky, opaque, and highly mediated?? which makes the fees rise. With blockchain, there would be greater transparency and immutability, and estimated USD 4 billion saved annually.They write: ???? blockchain may be able to generate value by fixing certain inefficiencies. If counterparties were to exchange cryptocurrency assets (digital currencies that do not need a central regulating body) rather than fiat currencies, for example, payments could be made and settled in minutes via blockchain, rather than in days as with current systems.?ùRippleNet is an example here, as is the Interbank Information Network (IIN), a peer-to-peer network powered by blockchain technology, launched by JPMorgan Chase in 2017.Barriers to adoption at scale include limitations to anonymity and the current impossibility of real-time settlement.?úKYC protocols are critical tools in the battle against fraud?? stands in the article, with banks losing USD 15-20 billion every year from identity fraud alone. There are also intensifying regulatory pressures to protect customer data placed on banks. The current solutions they employ ?úhave increased efficiency but have led to longer onboarding times and higher costs.?ùWith blockchain, the entire onboarding process is simplified and a lot faster; overlapping KYC and AML compliance checks are eliminated and information burden lightened; banks can disseminate data as it is updated; and it can create up to USD 1 billion of savings in operating costs for retail banks globally and reduce regulatory fines by USD 2-3 billion to USD 3 billion. ?úIn addition, we expect blockchain solutions to reduce annual losses from fraud by USD 7 billion to USD 9 billion.?ùBlockchains is being tested in ID fraud detection. One example is the creation of digital identify networks. In 2017, Bluzelle, a blockchain-based data-storage startup, worked with a consortium of three banks in Singapore. They?ôve tested a platform for KYC, which showed that a blockchain platform would ?úimprove efficiency, cut the risk of financial crime, and heighten responsiveness to performance and scheduling needs?? with cost reduction of 25%-50%.Challenges here include heavy capital costs needed for switching from individual to shared systems and a list of practical challenges that have to be overcome in every step of the way, from the customer, over the merchant, to the bank. ?úIn addition, banks must adapt to a significant evolution in culture, which is predicated on the need to share data.?ùRisk assessment is often complicated, there is a lack of information, and ?úmay not have made enough noncash financial transactions for assessing their creditworthiness. As a result, banks tend to be conservative when making credit decisions.?ùWith blockchain, banks would theoretically be able to see data uploaded by any bank within the network, which would lead to ?úfaster decisions, more efficient processes, and the potential for a more informed credit-allocation process.??Challenges here are both technical and cultural, so it might be more difficult to bring banks and customers on board.The authors find that these three things are needed to increase adoption of blockchain:?úThe key to countering those concerns is to keep an eye on the prize: lower costs, less friction, and a safer retail banking system,'' the authors write.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

","The most recent confirmation that major cryptocurrency exchange Binance  will be rolling out its margin trading feature ""soon"" left the cryptoverse abuzz with warnings that new traders should stay away from this very risky instrument. ","Binance CEO, Changpeng Zhao, hinted about the new feature by posting a screenshot of their upgraded website today, while later the company confirmed to TechCrunch that the margin trading is coming ""soon."" According to the report, it has already been beta tested among selected users.A warning in the screenshot reminds that ?úMargin trading confers a higher profit potential than traditional trading, but also greater risks.

Essentially, the traders are in debt, which is risky. It can reap great rewards, or lead to financial ruin. So it's no wonder that crypto traders warn newbies to be extra careful with this instrument:Trading leverage isn?ôt for a newb.

","Who says the token sale craze is over? Cryptocurrency exchange Bittrex International sold out VeriBlock (VBK) tokens in their Initial Exchange Offering (IEO) within 10.4 seconds from the start, to a total of 855 purchasers, out of which 142 people bought the maximum amount set at VBK 200,000 (USD 20,000.) ","With this token sale, Bittrex beat even Binance Launchpad, the token sale platform of major cryptocurrency exchange  Binance, whose fastest token sell-out time was 22 seconds in the case of Fetch.AI. Bittrex announced the IEO, a fundraising method similar to an ICO (initial coin offering) but facilitated through an exchange, in late March, after a failed attempt at starting one for the RAID token. The sale started at 16:00 UTC on Tuesday, April 2nd, and according to a tweet by Bittrex?ôs official Twitter account, ended within the next 10 seconds. The price was set at around USD 0.1 per coin, and the supply was 70,000,000 VBK, or around USD 7 million. Since only 855 people managed to get their hands on VBK, part of the community is disappointed and even suspects foul play, similarly to what Binance is facing after a token sale on Binance Launchpad is over.?úHi [Bittrex] you lost Trust from your loyal users,??writes Twitter user @Rio_Rv. Others are claiming bots were used to purchase the tokens, pushing out people who wanted to participate. ?úIf it was ended [sic] in 10 seconds then why I haven't got [sic]. I got in within 1 second clicked maximum amount and confirmed. System started to post the error that sale haven't [sic] started yet and after few [sic] seconds it was ended,??writes @Waseemrid.Bots may not even come into the equation, as the enthusiasm from the community could have been the catalyst for such a quick sale. Twitter user @LordCatoshi posted a video of people supposedly waiting for the sale to start and purchasing tokens, to which he jokingly added, ?úNo wonder I have no VBK now.?ùSo I was still wiping my ass while competing with these group for the Veriblock sale on BittrexNo wonder I have no $VBK now pic.twitter.com/CJbOSCup1MHowever, this was the case with Binance Launchpad, that plans to test their new rules in April, also:WOW - @binance Launch Pad hype :-) pic.twitter.com/3VBjWaxCi4Bittrex was not available for immediate comment. They have also not yet revealed their plans regarding the listing of the VBK token on their exchange, simply telling users to ?ústay tuned??for more news. As reported, VeriBlock is a blockchain project that aims to allow any blockchain to use the Proof of Work security that Bitcoin has, regardless of their own consensus protocol, through Proof of Proof - a protocol that records snapshots of any given blockchain and embeds them in Bitcoin transactions. According to the project, this allows the blockchain to inherit Bitcoin?ôs security characteristics by allowing users to determine the correct chain by referencing snapshots in the event of a 51% attack.In case of conflicting snapshots, users are warned about a potential rewrite before they can confirm the transaction, and the system also tells them when the transaction is safe to accept.

","Peer-to-peer transactional system based on blockchain, QuarkChain, launched their mainnet today and claims they already have enterprise-level clients. ","?úThe biggest one is already implemented, and we?ôll be able to share in a few months after the first readouts. There have been two main industries, supply chain and fintech,??Anthurine Xiang, Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) at QuarkChain, told Cryptonews.com. The QuarkChain mainnet implements state sharding, which means that different ledger states can be stored on different shards. Additionally, it features different types of consensus algorithms that are customizable by the user, cross shard transactions, and support for multi-native tokens.As reported in February, Blockchain project Zilliqa (ZIL) launched its mainnet, heralded the first ever successful implementation of a scaling technology called sharding on a blockchain. However, as for who their biggest competitors are, Xiang adds, ?úIt?ôs very different. Binance?ôs biggest advantage is their traffic, not their technology. People like to build on top of that for now.?ùAccording to her, enterprises have bigger requirements and value technology more than traffic.?úWe?ôre the only place where you can find multiple different technologies coexisting. That?ôs why I think we compete with all other public chains in different ways - we?ôre not designed for today, we?ôre designed for the future,??the CMO said.Although having a public blockchain necessitates also having a wallet, QuarkChain decided to go beyond that. ?úThis wallet has a much bigger scope: it doesn?ôt only support QuarkChain, it also supports [ERC20 tokens] and TRON, and it?ôs going to support multiple public chains. We currently have around 50,000 users on our wallet,??Xiang said.The project had also announced their intent to reach 100,000 transactions per second (TPS) this year:?úLast year we reached 55,000 TPS, but I don?ôt think TPS is a problem. Sure, on the testnet you want to demonstrate how fast you can be, but the mainnet is based on real needs. If our customers need more TPS, the mainnet will offer that - reaching 100,000 won?ôt be a problem since we?ôve already reached 55,000 TPS.?ùAlthough the company has no intention to hold a new fundraiser (they raised USD 20 million worth of ether in June 2018) - at most, they intend to charge their enterprise clients for offering dedicated services tailored to their needs. ?úSince all tokens generated on QuarkChain will be native tokens, they will be able to choose whether they want to pay gas fees or hold ICOs (initial coin offerings,) which will be done in QuarkChain tokens (QKC). If you want to open new shards, you need QuarkChain tokens. If you want to issue new tokens, or register a website name, it can be done using QKC as well. The token will be used by people for those large-scale changes, and this will be our revenue model.?ùQKC price chart:The QuarkChain network consists of two layers of blockchains, the first being elastic sharding and the second layer being a root blockchain which confirms the blocks from the first layer. The idea is that a larger number of shards can process more transactions concurrently resulting in a greater system capacity.QuarkChain also targets multiple cheap nodes to form clusters rather than super-full node which often encourages centralization, according to them. ?úThe simplest explanation is that for Bitcoin, there will always be mining pools; for delayed Proof of Stake, it?ôs always a certain number of nodes that can participate in the network. If I?ôm a very small node or miner, and if I don?ôt join a pool or have a very expensive machine, I can?ôt participate in the network. QuarkChain has two layers: the root chain and shards. The root is definitely more difficult in terms of hash power, but the return is also larger. But if I only have a little hash power, that?ôs also fine because I can always mine on the shards. We certainly consider this more decentralized,??Xiang explains.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

","The crypto community had been looking forward to the launch of the Brave Ads service by the Brave browser for a long time, but as it turns out, there is a caveat: they?ôre currently only available in five countries, so the cryptoverse is looking for ways to bypass these restrictions.","Users of Brave?ôs desktop browsers, available for Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems, can now opt into Brave Rewards to view Brave Ads and receive 70% of the ad revenue as a reward in the form of Basic Attention Tokens (BAT). These tokens can then be used to contribute to Brave-verified publishers as a way to show appreciation for their content. ?úSince Brave Ads are opt-in, brands know with certainty that when their campaigns run with Brave, their ads are viewed by people who welcome advertising.

","Nowadays, the idea of exchanges offering fundraising platforms for young projects seems to be everywhere, with competition steadily increasing as more and more exchanges join the fun. The most recent example comes from cryptocurrency exchange Gate.io, which just launched its so-called Gate.io Startup, a token sale platform that will hold its first sale on April 22nd.","The first initial exchange offering (IEO) project that Gate.io Startup will host is called Crypto Neo-value Neural (CNNS) and intends to build a ?úvibrant blockchain ecosphere to facilitate users to discover, invest in, and exchange information and values of crypto assets,??according to the announcement. The total supply that the platform is looking to sell is 600 million CNNS: 150 million in Tether (USDT) and 450 million in Gatechain Tokens (GT). However, since recently launched Gatechain Tokens are not yet available for trading - which will happen after the second phase of distribution, which started on April 15th - 1 GT will be worth 0.6 USDT, and will be adjusted according to the GT daily opening price between April 25th and May 25th. At the price of 0.006 USDT for 1 CNNS, the project will raise USD 3.6 million if the whole supply is sold out. A single individual can buy no less than 20,000 CNNS and no more than 500,000 CNNS, and the Startup adds, ?úIf the project cannot fulfill its fund-raising goal within the given time [between UTC 4:00 and UTC 6:00 on April 22nd], users will get refunded and the project will be delisted.??IEO platforms in general are going to be really interesting because we?ôre gonna be able to do the due diligence for users", because a lot of those users who invested in initial coin offerings didn?ôt necessarily do their due diligence. One of the big ways that we?ôre going to be different is that we?ôre not going to require projects to be raising in Gatechain Token or in our own coin, Marie Tatibouet, Chief Marketing Officer at Gate.io told Cryptonews.com, adding that they don't charge a listing fee.The company has launched its native token called Gatechain Token, which will power its Gatechain decentralized exchange, set for launch in Q4 of this year. Gate.io recently raised USD 64 million in crypto for the project. Currently, the only way to obtain GT is to buy so-called POINTs, which serve as a way to deduct trading fees and similar operational costs at the exchange, and get GT as a reward at a maximum rate of 2.5 GT to 1 POINT. In a recent blog post, the exchange announced they had received USD 3 billion worth of orders placed during the first phase of the POINTs sale and GT distribution. Gate.io thus joins the likes of Binance, OKEx, and Bittrex - all of which have their own token sale platforms - in the so-called ?úkiller app??club, coined by Binance?ôs CEO Changpeng Zhao in February this year.In April, OKEx said that their first IEO lasted 'one second' after investors showed a strong interest in the Blockcloud project.

","One of the biggest trends in crypto right now is for proof-of-stake (PoS) cryptocurrencies, with the likes of Cosmos, PIVX and EOS being some of the more recent examples. And with this trend, there has been an almost parallel growth in third-party staking services, platforms which stake coins on behalf of users who don't have the time or inclination to stake coins for themselves.","However, while such 'Staking-as-a-Service' (SaaS) platforms are in many respects good for investors who want to earn a return on their money without doing much technical legwork, the practice of placing coins with third parties comes with risks.In contrast to proof-of-work (PoW) coins, PoS cryptos reward miners with new coins depending on how much they stake relative to other miners. While this can be a simpler process than calculating the correct hash for a block, it still requires a level of expertise beyond most ?òlaypeople.??Most staking coins make it non-trivial to stake your coins and 'earn' the transaction and block reward fees"," says Bitcoin Core developer Jimmy Song. """"Much like the tax code"," PoS coins optimize on technical competence required so that only the 'worthy' get some of the coins.""""As Song explains to Cryptonews.com"," SaaS platforms have appeared precisely because they help the average investor """"optimize stake rewards without all the headache of running the software."""" This would account for why the industry is now home to the likes of Staked", Anchorage and Coinbase Custody, all of which launched their staking services within the last 12 months.Even more recently, Battlestar Capital launched at the end of March, with its co-founder and chief of research, Jason Stone, telling Cryptonews.com that investors can expert handsome returns," depending on the cryptocurrency.""""The growth in portfolios of Battlestar clients is directly proportional to the coins they deposit with Battlestar"," he explains. """"Some coins", like Zen, deliver 25-35% yield in Zen token," paid by the Blockchain to the staker of Zen.""""However", there are worries that the SaaS system carries several risks. Most prominent of all is the risk of centralization, and as NEM Ventures co-founder Kailin O?ôDonnell tells Cryptonews.com," this has implications for security as well as for the concentration of voting power.""""Any new custodial service introduces risk into the system"," he says. """"Historically"," exchanges have always been a primary target for hackers in the space and SaaS platforms will be subject to the same or similar level of risk.""""Likewise", Jimmy Song explains that custodial services require you to hand over control of your coins to a third party," and that if they """"go bust for whatever reason (hacking", gov't intervention, founder dying with the only private key)," you're out of luck.""""Perhaps more urgently"," Song points out another risk. """"The other thing is that a lot of PoS coins use some form of voting for features"," he adds. """"The third parties could potentially use the voting power to influence the coin's development. Much like mining pools"," the policy may end up being determined solely by the SaaS platforms.""""Staking services acknowledge this risk"," yet they also affirm that it will be slight compared to the risks witnessed with PoW currencies and mining pools.""""I think there's some concern about centralization but I don't think it will get anywhere near as centralized as mining"," Tim Ogilvie ??the CEO of Staked ??tells Cryptonews.com. """"There simply aren't the same cost efficiencies that have forced mining pools to become so dominant.""""One other potential danger of third-party staking is that they could end up infecting crypto with a form of fractional-reserve banking"," something which cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin were designed to avoid.""""Staking-as-a-Service platforms absolutely run the risk of creating a de-facto system of fractional reserve banking", warns Robert Viglione," the CEO of privacy-focused blockchain platform Horizen. """"It lets investors who do so not only earn returns on their staked funds"," but also gives them the ability to redeem their staked tokens whenever they choose.""""Viglione adds that SaaS """"gives the service platforms incentive to lend out the value of the staked holdings to generate further revenue."""" This could be dangerous if the users of these platforms", perhaps wanting to take advantage of arbitrage opportunities, decide to withdraw their staked tokens, something which could result in a 'run' on one or a number of SaaS services.However," the staking services themselves don't think this is a real risk. """"These claims are silly and suggest that the person doesn't understand staking and/or fractional reserve banking"," says Staked's Tim Ogilvie. """"Staking is backed entirely by a staked asset"," there's no concept of rehypothecation or other forms of fractional reserves whatsoever.""""Jimmy Song agrees with Ogilvie?ôs assessment", noting that staked coins generally have to be locked up with the corresponding PoS system and therefore can?ôt really be loaned out to anyone else. Nonetheless, he warns that a much bigger risk is that of inflation.

","After US-headquartered major crypto company Coinbase announced its new Visa debit card for their UK clients this week, another provider or Visa card for payments with cryptocurrencies, Crypto.com, claims it already has more than 100,000 card reservations in the US and Europe. ","?úWe are going to launch in the US soon, and Europe will follow shortly after. It?ôs going to be the only cryptocurrency card available globally this year. We think that we have a product that?ôs very competitive even against major banks. Currently, we have over 100,000 card reservations. That global rollout is a big part of our strategy to increase the size of the platform,??Kris Marszalek, co-founder and CEO of the Hong Kong-headquartered payments and cryptocurrency platform, told Cryptonews.com. The MCO Visa Card, which is paired with their wallet and is accepted by all retailers that work with Visa, is available in Singapore since October 2018. Back then, the company planned to issue 100,000 ?úcryptocurrency Visa prepaid cards??over the next two months. However, Marszalek declined to comment on their results in more detail, only saying that all their services have 400,000 users in total. It includes wallet users, trading, credit services, and crypto payments.Meanwhile, Coinbase plans to support customers in unspecified other European countries in the coming months, however, there is no timeline on the new card?ôs launch in the US. Also, Singapore-based digital wallet and payment card company TenX launched their card in January this year and now their roadmap includes expansion in the Asia-Pacific region in 2019, only.Meanwhile, according to the CEO, crypto trading transaction volume on their platform ?úwent up by 25x??in the first quarter this year.?úWe?ôve released new perks and tighter pricing, and deployed a new trading engine designed to give you the best prices when trading through our app,??Marszalek said, adding that they expect that the next time ?úthe market turns??is probably next year. Also, they?ôre are working on ?úsome new strategies??that would address their users??suggestions that they would like to see ?úmore aggressive portfolio.?ùThe company has also deployed their so-called Chain testnet on March 20th, and the mainnet itself is planned for next year, although there is no date set at this point. ?úWe?ôll start processing transactions with our merchants very soon even though the mainnet is not live yet. Even though it?ôs off-chain, the entire infrastructure will very closely mimic what will happen on-chain when the mainnet is live. The testnet is open-source, so we get a lot of feedback from the community,??Marszalek said.Additionally, the company is looking for partnerships in three specific categories: traditional payments, which means integrating local payment networks in different regions to offer better services; consumer flywheels, which includes companies that will help them reach millions of users; and technology partnerships.?úWe keep the approach that we don?ôt want to invent everything in house,??the CEO said. ?úEach of these categories we?ôve had some good traction so we?ôll be announcing those soon.?ùThe CRO token, which serves to enable interoperability between cryptocurrencies and fiat payments, is one of the two coins that power the project. The other is MCO, used in the ecosystem in order to earn rewards on purchases and staking, and to pay for referrals. In other words, MCO is the app?ôs utility token, while CRO will be the native settlement system.In March, CRO was listed on cryptocurrency exchange Upbit, and it has seen distinct upwards movement in the past week with a total increase of a whopping 80%. However, since it is significantly younger than its MCO counterpart, it is also listed on fewer exchanges, but that is also set to change. ?úOur MCO token is listed on more than 30 exchanges and CRO on just five or six, so this is an ongoing process, and we expect to list on every major exchange to provide maximum liquidity to the token. There?ôs definitely more listings that are going to happen soon. If anyone wants to guess where CRO is going to trade, they can check where MCO is already trading - that?ôs a good proxy,??Marszalek said.CRO price chart:",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

","Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology is being used to hunt down Ponzi schemes related to cryptocurrencies in South Korea, and was already successful in catching two suspects who reportedly cheated around 56,000 people of a total of KRW 21.2 billion (USD 18.7 million). This comes after AI was already proven to be useful in cases such as pump and dump schemes, recognizing such events before they even happen.","Last Thursday, the Seoul Special Judicial Police Bureau for Public Safety arrested two CEOs of an unspecified online marketplace that reportedly preyed upon people with little knowledge about cryptocurrencies, along with 10 other members, all of which had been recruiting people for six months since May 2018 in a Ponzi scheme, Korea JoongAng Daily reported. Along with offering existing members cash rewards for recruiting new people, members were also awarded with 600 M-Coin - the business??official, unlisted cryptocurrency, which was also sold to the same victims for a range between KRW 100 - KRW 500, and the malicious actors told the members that it would rise to KRW 200 - KRW 600, promising immediate profit, according to the report. Since the coin was unlisted, members never made any money - nor could they, it added.?úThrough keywords such as Ponzi, loan and recruiting members, we were able to teach the AI patterns of Ponzi schemes. The program can also identify advertisement patterns and identified the enterprise in question, which [was caught] with evidence provided by an unnamed informant,??Hong Nam-ki, section chief of the bureau?ôs second investigation team, was quoted as saying in the report. This is not the first time AI is being used to catch malicious actors in the cryptocurrency space. In December 2018, a research team from Imperial College London came forward with an idea of how to use the technology to recognize pump and dump schemes. Their machine learning algorithm was taught to recognize unusual buying activity around certain coins, managing to pinpoint six different cases, five out of which turned out to be pump and dump schemes. Pump and dump schemes are quite simple: a group of malicious actors buy some obscure cryptocurrency quietly, and then generate hype around the coin so that other, unsuspecting traders may buy as well which, in turn, makes the coin?ôs price spike. Once the price peaks, the original group sells their hoard and makes a quick profit off anyone who was too slow to sell off.

",Imagine an alternate universe in which Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin never started working on Ethereum because he was way too busy with his internship at gross settlement system Ripple. ,"At the very least, the rankings of coins by market capitalization would be vastly different, but how many other events would have been affected by this change? Luckily, the US Department of Labor had the cryptoverse?ôs back when they decided to refuse Buterin?ôs visa application - and the course of history was set on the right track.Following a story about Chinese entrepreneur Eric Yuan who, after being denied his US visa application eight times, still made it to the US to become the major shareholder of video conference services firm Zoom Video Communications (and a billionaire), Buterin came forward with his own story. Fun fact: I tried to be an intern at Ripple back in the day (mid 2013), but US visa complications having to do with the fact that the company had only existed for 9 months and the minimum was 1 year stopped me.Now Buterin sits in Canada, having had to satisfy his need to work on blockchain projects by publishing the Ethereum whitepaper in late 2013, presumably due to the sorrow that followed having such an excellent opportunity at an existing company ripped away under his nose. Meanwhile, in February, Buterin was making a tongue-in-cheek fun of Ripple?ôs partnership announcements that they have been making on Twitter. I think you want to use XRP. The chart for XRP/XRP would look the same so it's also sound money, but they have Institutional adoption??and Partnerships??so they're better.However, in 2013, Buterin wrote an article where he praised Ripple: ""Altogether, what Ripple has accomplished is impressive. With Ripple, we have a way of sending, receiving, and holding any currency ??not just one specific cryptocurrency ??in a decentralized way.??

","A mobile application called Haven is set for launch in the second quarter of this year, developed by OB1, the company behind the the decentralized online marketplace OpenBazaar, and it is currently entering the testing phase, as Cryptonews.com learned. Additionally, the marketplace is looking to integrate Ethereum, as well as release their own token, during this same timeframe.","Jenn Cloud, head of marketing and communications at OB1, told us that, ?úHaven is a new super-app built on the OpenBazaar network that enables you to shop, chat, and send cryptocurrencies privately from your mobile device.??But the quarter does not end at this, as Cloud said that the company is going to integrate Ethereum and release their own token - but more information will become available as time progresses.The marketplace is currently only accessible through a program, which they explain on their website, ?úInstead of asking people to connect to each other through a website or network that we owned, we wanted to just let users connect directly to each other, exactly how they do with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, but with a nice interface that felt like the payment processors and marketplaces they were used to.?ùHowever, this is also set to change during this year. 
?úWe will also be tackling a web application that will allow users to buy and sell on OpenBazaar entirely from their browser,??Cloud said. ?úWe will also be tackling a web application that will allow users to buy and sell on OpenBazaar entirely from their browser,??Cloud said. As for how they will maintain decentralization and their peer-to-peer workmode, she explains, ?úIt is still being researched as there are many questions which need to be answered, but what changed was primarily the introduction of IPFS-JS. The OpenBazaar code uses IPFS for distribution of content and peer-to-peer networking, and by using IPFS-JS we could run more or less the same OpenBazaar application we have on desktop, except in a browser. Users would have an experience almost identical to using a regular website, but would actually be accessing the peer-to-peer network just as they would from desktop.?ùIPFS-JS is the Javascript implementation of the IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) protocol, which is a network designed to create a content-addressable, peer-to-peer method of storing and sharing hypermedia in a distributed file system. In other words, it is a peer-to-peer distributed file system that seeks to connect all computing devices with the same system of files. This would mean that implementing IPFS as a solution could ensure that OpenBazaar does not fall into the trap of centralization, but removes the need for downloading a program.The improvement of privacy features is also in the pipeline.?úOne improvement underway is working to get Tor [The Onion Router, a privacy-focused browser] integrated without needing to manually configure anything, which will allow people to use Tor with OpenBazaar much more easily. There are other features we are considering such as automatically deleting personal information (such as shipping data) when orders are completed, offering support for privacy-focused operating systems, and creating a separate ?òOpenBazaar-Private??installer which offers a version that uses privacy features by default.?ùA decentralized marketplace is sure to attract some interesting people, both as buyers and sellers, and OpenBazaar is no exception. 
?úWe have seen all kinds of this listed from property and cars, new and used items from electronics to bondage gear to underwear,??Cloud said.
