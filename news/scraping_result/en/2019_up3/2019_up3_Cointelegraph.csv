Earlier in the week, BTC swiftly dropped by 10% after failing to hold above the $8,000 support.","Crypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360By Thursday, BTC/USD was sitting on the bottom trendline of the descending channel and many investors and analysts were calling for a drop to $7,000.A few even predicted that a revisit to the long-term support at $6,500 was on the cards. Despite the bearish bias, traders like Scott Melker and Michaël van de Poppe spotted a series of bullish divergences on the 4-hour and daily timeframe and by Friday morning (Oct. 25) the chart and various indicators on the hourly and 4-hour timeframe were flashing bullish.Investors believed that a quick upside move to $7,700-$7,800 would occur and many expected that bears would open their short positions at the top of this range and eventually push Bitcoin price back down to the mid $7,000s or high $6,000s at worst. Obviously, this is exactly what did not happen and the short squeeze that accompanied the first part of Bitcoin’s 16% rally from $7,450 to $8,600 resulted in the liquidation of $150 million shorts at BitMEX.BitMEX XBT USD Liquidations. Source: Skew.comAfter such a strong move, consolidation around the $8,300 to $8,500 region was the next expectation that traders had in mind. Tackling the $8,800 resistance would have been the next step and it seemed likely that this would play out depending on the state of the weekly candle at closing. Surprisingly, Bitcoin bulls gathered up enough steam for a final hurrah, and towards the evening of the U.S. trading session bulls pressed Bitcoin price far above the $8,800 resistance to set a higher high at $10,540.Analysts and traders will probably spend the weekend searching for the exact reasons that catalyzed today’s strong 36% surge — the biggest daily gain since 2011. Currently, the crypto community is pointing to Chinese President Xi Jinping’s call for the development of blockchain technology throughout the country. Bakkt’s Bitcoin futures back to back all-time high volume achievements are also being cited as a reason for Bitcoin’s surge. BTC/USD daily chart. Source: TradingviewAs shown by the daily chart, Bitcoin bounced off the descending trendline at $7,400, rallied up to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level, then rocketed through the 111, 128 and 200-day moving averages (DMA). The volume profile visible range shows that numerous levels of resistance were sliced through and the wick to $10,542 set a higher high not seen since Sept. 6. Bitcoin stopped its advance right at a high volume node (VPVR) and a move above $10,542 should proceed toward $10,970 and $11,500, and then to $12,000, according to the daily chart. If Bitcoin can clear $12,000 over the coming weeks, it could be set for a blue sky breakout.BTC/USD daily chart.

Source: TradingviewThe 36% surge even altered the trajectory of the weekly MACD, flipping the histogram from deep red to pink and curving the MACD up toward the signal line. As shown by the chart above, barring some unprecedented price reversal, Bitcoin appears set for a pleasant weekly close above the descending channel. Some will even go as far as labeling the current setup a trend reversal. Over the short-term, it is possible that Bitcoin could pull back to the upper arm of the descending channel at $9,360. This point also aligns with the upper arm of the Bollinger Band indicator and after strong upside moves the price has a tendency to settle near the top arm and the middle moving average of the indicator. On the daily timeframe, a drop to the 20-MA of the Bollinger Band indicator would set Bitcoin price near $8,200. Prior to reaching this point, Bitcoin could first retrance to $8,800 and $8,600, points which were reached on Oct. 9 and Oct. 11.BTC/USD 4-hour chart. Source: TradingviewAt the time of publishing, there is a spinning top candle on the 4-hour chart and volume has dropped off significantly when compared against the high volume spike seen on Oct. 26.

Source: TradingviewThe 4-hour RSI has also popped above 85, a point which in the past has marked exhaustion from buyers. The same can be said for the Stochastic RSI (Stoch). If Bitcoin has become overbought on the shorter timeframes, then the current spinning top candle is evidence of this. The current pause in momentum and indecision could also be the result of profit-taking and a drop off in volume as traders are wary of buying the top after such a high volume breakout. If the rally does not resume shortly, most traders will probably observe to see whether Bitcoin consolidates and builds support before entering into new positions. The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author (@HorusHughes) and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

A number of altcoins benefitted from this startling upside move and Ether (ETH) rallied 24.23% alongside Bitcon. ","Daily crypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360This week also saw a deluge of positive news from decentralized finance (DeFi) companies which are expanding, increasing interest payments, and reducing loan interest rates on many of the crypto-based products and services they offer. A few of the major DeFi-related announcements this week were: – Dharma relaunched it’s DeFi platform and now supports DAI and USD Coin (USDC)– Crypto-lending platform Nexo reduced its loan rates to 5.9% on all instant credit lines.– Celcius Network increased the interest of Tether (USDT) deposits to 9.75% and 12% for investors who opt to receive interest payments in CEL token.– Digital asset broker Voyager Digital announced that it would provide 3% interest on all Bitcoin held on it’s platform.While these developments might not be directly connected to the Ether, investors are aware that the number of Ether locked into DeFi platforms has risen tremendously risen throughout 2019 and the majority of DeFi platform are built on the Ethereum Network. According to data from DeFi Pulse there is currently $598.5 million worth of cryptocurrency locked into DeFi platforms and 3.3 million Ether tokens in lockup.Total Value (ETH) Locked in DeFi. Source: Defipulse.comIn a way, DeFi has become somewhat synonymous with Ether and the Ethereum network which could be leading investors to interpret all DeFi news as potentially bullish events for Ether.This week’s 30.29% gain from Ether backs up the claim that the altcoin’s price action has been riveting as of late. The week started with Bitcoin’s collapse from $8,050 which rocked Ether and caused its price to drop out of the descending wedge pattern to form a double bottom at $152.95. Prior to Friday’s massive Bitcoin led rally which saw BTC gain 42% and Ether 24.23%, the altcoin traded in a gray area, nudging quietly against the bottom trendline of the descending wedge. The historic Oct. 25 rally sent Ether price well above the trendlines of the descending wedge to set a near 2-week high at $199.61.ETH USD daily chart. Source: TradingViewCurrently Ether is situated right at the 50-day moving average after setting a 16-day high at $199.61 which was well above the 100-day moving average. A move back to $200 would place price on top of the upper Bollinger Band arm and right at the 200-day moving average (DMA). This move would also align with the steep drop from $204 that took place on Sept.24 and was previously the first sell target for any Ether position opened from $152. The volume profile visible range (VPVR) shows that in the current range from $180 to $206 there is limited overhead selling pressure so in addition to yesterday’s 24.23% gain, momentum traders might pull up their stop orders with the anticipation that volume sustaining on Bitcoin and Ethereum, Ether could still have an additional 11% to run. ETH USD daily MACD. Source: TradingViewThe daily moving average confluence divergence (MACD) also shows promise. The MACD and signal line pulled off a bullish crossover and the histogram flipped positive and currently sits above 0. The magnitude of this move is shown on the shorter time frames and the momentum on the 4-hour MACD histogram reached a high not seen since Sept. 28. The daily RSI has also entered bullish territory (50) ETH USD weekly chart. Source: TradingViewThe weekly time frame shows Ether broke above the descending channel and briefly pierced the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level, a point which is significant to many traders. Above the first take profit level ($204) Ether needs to surmount the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level $211.48 which would also represent a higher high above the 27.8% dump that occured on Sept. 23. An upside move to $211 would also nearly cross above the 20-week moving average on the weekly Bollinger Band indicator. ETH BTC daily chart. Source: TradingViewThe ETH/BTC pairing does not exhibit the same bullish scenario as the USD pairing. The 10% drop on Oct. 26 formed a monthly low (Sept. 26) and a double bottom at 0.018847 satoshis (sats) which is typically a reversal pattern. Ether remains below the 200-DMA and Friday’s drop also plunged the altcoin below the 50-DMA. Without reading into the situation too deeply, it's possible that as Bitcoin made its stunning upside move, traders shifted into BTC to catch the action. The daily MACD, RSI and Stoch RSI are all also uninspiring. Traders can keep an eye on volume and the recently formed double bottom to see if this leads to a reversal. One would expect that if the ETH/BTC pair turns bullish, similarly significant price action will be mirrored on the ETH/USD pairing. In the event that the ETH/USD pairing turns bearish and drops below $170, there is support by the previous double bottom at $152.95 and the support at $146.60.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author (@HorusHughes) and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

The numbers underscore the continued interest in Bitcoin, coming despite the bearish price action in the second half of 2019. Its ability to beat out major fiat alternatives including Visa and Mastercard is meanwhile nothing new. As Cointelegraph reported, in April, new research even suggested that Bitcoin could overtake the fiat payment heavyweights by 2029.“In just 10 years, Bitcoin has managed to compete with the leaders of the payment system industry. Bitcoin’s development is occurring exponentially,” analysis firm DataLight concluded at the time. In the future, as the development of off-chain scaling solutions such as the Lightning Network brings new advances, less and less activity in Bitcoin will occur on the blockchain.

This shows that the crypto space is generating interest among buyers. ","Cryptocurrency market daily performance. Source: Coin360Many major cryptocurrencies are showing signs of selling exhaustion. When the bulls buy breakdowns from critical support levels, instead of panicking, it shows that the sentiment is changing. As the recovery is across the board, it increases the sustainability of the move. Recently, Joel Birch, the founder of crypto hedge fund and market research firm Lunar, said that traders should view a drop below $8,000 as a buying opportunity. Though the initial interest in Bakkt futures was not very encouraging, the platform continues to add new features for institutional traders. On Oct. 24 Bakkt announced the launch of regulated options contract for Bitcon futures starting on Dec. 9. With these tools at their disposal, institutional investors are likely to show greater interest once the market starts a trending move. The recent spurt in volume on Bakkt is also a sign that institutional interest is gradually picking up.In previous analysis we had suggested that the current fall was looking like a bear trap. Now that a turnaround has occurred we must take a closer look in order to see if it is a good time to start buying? Let’s analyze the charts. The failure of the bears to capitalize on the breakdown of $7,702.87 on Oct. 23 has attracted buyers. A failed breakdown of a critical level, followed by a quick reversal is usually a sign that the bears are losing their grip and a bottom is around the corner.As the BTC/USD pair climbed above the previous support turned resistance of $7,702.87, it picked up momentum that resulted in a sharp rally. The pace of the rise from the lows shows aggressive buying by the bulls and short covering by the bears. The up move has broken out of the 20-day EMA, which is a positive sign. The next target to watch on the upside is the 50-day SMA. If this level is crossed, a rally to the downtrend line, close to $10,000, is likely. This is an important level to watch out for because if the bulls scale above the downtrend line, the uptrend will resume. As the sentiment has turned bullish, traders can use dips to $8,200 to buy. A stop loss can be kept at $7,200. Our bullish view will be invalidated if the bears defend the overhead resistance zone and sink the price below the recent lows of $7,297.21. Though Ether (ETH) broke below the initial support at $161.056, the bears could not break below the Sept. 24 low of $151.829. This shows that lower levels are attracting buyers, instead of resulting in a panic.Repeated failures of the bears to break below $151.829 resulted in a sharp pullback. The up move has reached the downtrend line, which is likely to act as a stiff resistance. If this level is crossed, the relief rally can reach $196.483. Above this, the ETH/USD pair can rise to $235.70. Therefore, traders can buy on a breakout and close above the 50-day SMA with a stop loss of $150. The bullish divergence on the RSI also points to a rally. Our bullish view will be invalidated if the pair turns down from the downtrend line and plummets below $150. The bulls purchased the sharp dip to $0.24715 on Oct. 23. This shows that the sentiment is to buy the dips rather than panic and sell positions, which is a positive sign. If the buyers can push XRP above $0.29227 to $0.30368 resistance zone, a move to $0.34229 will be on the cards. Therefore, traders can continue to hold their long positions with the stop loss at $0.24.If the bulls fail to push the price above the overhead resistance zone, the XRP/USD pair might remain range-bound for a few more days. Our positive view will be negated if the bears sink the pair below the $0.24508 to $0.22 support zone. If this zone breaks down, the downtrend will resume. However, we give it a low probability of occurring.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) dipped below the critical support of $203.36 on Oct. 23 but the bears could not capitalize on it because, by close (UTC time), the price had risen back above $203.36. This showed a lack of sellers at lower levels. Failure to follow through on a breakdown, after a bearish pattern is a bullish sign.The bulls have pushed the price above the top of the range at $241.85 and are currently attempting to scale above the 50-day SMA. If successful, the rally can extend to the neckline of the head and shoulders pattern, which might act as a resistance. However, if this level is crossed, a move to $360 is likely.We do not suggest chasing prices higher. Traders can wait for the BCH/USD pair to dip towards $242 before buying. The stop loss can be kept at $196. Litecoin (LTC) has bounced sharply from the lows of Oct. 23. The bulls are attempting to break above the downtrend line, which is a stiff resistance. Above this level, the next resistance is likely to be the 50-day SMA. If the price turns down from this zone, it will extend its stay inside $47.1851 to $59.9743 range. However, if the bulls can push the price above the overhead resistance zone, a rally to $80.2731 is likely. Therefore, traders can buy above $63 and keep a stop loss at $47. Our view will be invalidated if the LTC/USD pair reverses direction from the current levels and plummets below the recent lows of $47.1851.The bulls defended the support at $2.4001 on Oct. 23, which is a positive sign. The sharp pullback in EOS is likely to face resistance at $3.370. If the bulls fail to scale above this level, a few days of consolidation between $2.4001 and $3.370 is possible. A consolidation, if followed by a breakout, signals accumulation by strong hands at lower levels. Longer the consolidation, stronger will be the eventual breakout from it. A breakout of $3.370 can carry the price to $4.240 and above it to $4.8719. Therefore, traders can buy on a breakout and close (UTC time) above $3.370 and keep an initial stop loss of $2.40.Our view will be invalidated if the EOS/USD pair turns down from one of the overhead resistance levels and plunges below $2.4001.Binance Coin (BNB) again took support closer to $18.30. This is the second time the bulls have held this level in the past fortnight, which shows that buyers are using the dips to accumulate. If the bulls can now propel the BNB/USD pair above the channel, it will signal the end of the downtrend. Therefore, we retain the buy recommendation given in an earlier analysis. Our bullish view will be invalidated if the bulls fail to sustain above the channel. A break below $14.2555 will be a huge negative.Bitcoin SV (BSV) found support at the 20-day EMA on Oct. 23, which is a positive sign. The subsequent bounce has been strong and it picked up momentum after breaking out of the overhead resistance zone at $107 to $115.170.With the 20-day EMA sloping up gradually and the RSI in the positive territory, the advantage is with the bulls. There is a minor resistance at $138.95 and above it $160. Instead of chasing prices higher, we suggest traders wait for a dip before buying. Our bullish view will be negated if the BSV/USD reverses direction from the current levels and dives below the support at $90.40.Stellar (XLM) is trying to form a higher floor at $0.056. The bulls purchased the dip to this level on Oct. 23, which is a positive sign. If the buyers can push the price above the downtrend line, a rally to $0.088708 is possible. Conversely, if the XLM/USD pair fails to scale above the downtrend line, it will remain range-bound for a few more days. A break below the immediate support at $0.056 can drag the price to the critical support at $0.051014. If this level also cracks, the downtrend will resume. Therefore, traders can retain the stop loss on the long position at $0.051. Tron (TRX) bounced off the immediate support at $0.0136940 on Oct. 23. It has broken out of the moving averages and is attempting to scale above the downtrend line. Both moving averages are flat and the RSI is close to the center, which indicates a balance between the bulls and the bears.If the bulls can push the price above the downtrend line, a move to $0.018660 is likely. We anticipate the bears to offer a strong defense at this level. If the TRX/USD pair turns down from this level, it will extend its stay inside the range. A break below $0.0116262 to $0.011240 support zone will resume the downtrend. We will wait for a buy setup to form before proposing a trade in it.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

cryptography, a key component underpinning cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.","Oct 26, 2019","The Standing Committee of the 13th National People's Congress in China has passed a new law regulating cryptography on Oct. 26 that will take effect on Jan. 1, 2020, reports local news outlet CCTV. ","Per the report, the new regulatory framework aims to set standards for the application of cryptography and the management of passwords. The new regulatory framework establishes the role of a central cryptographic agency meant to lead public cryptographic work, creating guidelines and policies for the industry. The draft of the law was published on May 7 by a Chinese news outlet. The text is largely focused on government centralized password management and does not explicitly mention cryptocurrency, though it does focus on cryptography, a key component underpinning cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.Wan explained: “The key take away is — the developing of new cryptography, hashing algo, even the usage of the tech, will be in the official legal realm. This means you need to follow the CCP standard for all ‘encrypted’ behaviors, which can be VERY broad, from mining to block propagation.”She concluded that the law is building the foundation for the upcoming Chinese national cryptocurrency, though there is no official timetable for its launch, one Chinese official confirmed in September. As Cointelegraph reported yesterday, China’s President Xi Jinping has called for the country to accelerate its adoption of blockchain technologies. Meanwhile, this past week, Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg warned that Chinese superiority in the digital currency space could put the U.S. dollar at risk in an attempt to sell lawmakers his plans for the Libra stablecoin.""China is moving quickly to launch a similar idea in the coming months. We can't sit here and assume that because America is today the leader that it will always get to be the leader if we don't innovate,” he argued in an official statement. "

Buterin shared a seemingly snarky analogy:“My one-sentence impression of recent quantum supremacy stuff so far is that it is to real quantum computing what hydrogen bombs are to nuclear fusion. Proof that a phenomenon and the capability to extract power from it exist, but still far from directed use toward useful things.”Bitcoin evangelist and educator Andreas Antonopoulos echoed similar sentiments towards Google’s quantum computer at the beginning of October, when he said that the threat to Bitcoin by Google’s quantum supremacy is “zip, bupkis nada:”“What is the effect on mining and the cryptocurrency world in general? Zip, bupkis, nada, nothing really happens. Quantum supremacy – what Google described – is demonstrating the practical applicability of quantum computers to certain classes of problems. Those classes of problems are not the same class of problem we’re talking about when we talk about breaking cryptography.”In theory, quantum computers could vastly speed up the process of solving complex calculations and might therefore pose a real threat to Bitcoin’s proof-of-work mechanism, as well as blockchain technology at large. Quantum calculations will be endlessly superior to modern cryptography, in such a way that it could reverse cryptocurrency transactions and possibly gain access to private keys.Scott Aaronson, a quantum theoretician at the University of Texas at Austin, recently claimed that Google’s quantum computing technology could actually turn out to be a huge help to improve the technology which underpins proof-of-stake (PoS) cryptocurrencies. He wrote on his blog:“A sampling-based quantum supremacy experiment could almost immediately be repurposed to generate bits that can be proven to be random to a skeptical third party (under computational assumptions). This, in turn, has possible applications to proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies and other cryptographic protocols. I’m hopeful that more such applications will be discovered in the near future.”"

Six working days later, a senior banking executive said the status quo would continue until conditions improved.“Once normalcy is restored, we are very confident that we can resume servicing our customers in full capacity,” Salim Sfeir, head of local lender Bank of Beirut, told Reuters on Thursday.Previously, long queues were seen at ATMs as worried consumers attempted to access their wealth. Around 65% of Lebanon is banked, figures say, leaving two-thirds of the country cut off from personal funds. For well-known Lebanese statistician, former trader and author of “The Black Swan,” Nassim Nicholas Taleb, the government’s policy was enough to directly endorse cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.“The most potent case for cryptocurrencies: banks are never there when you need them,” he summarized in a tweet. Taleb continued: “And they are trying to bully the public so they avoid accountability and profit disbursements. Bankers are legal crooks.”The anger is reminiscent of other recent episodes of economic chaos, during which states have withheld money for their own purposes. In addition to Hong Kong this year, an infamous example is India, which in 2016 began a series of botched currency reforms which left hundreds of millions of people holding worthless notes.India’s taste for Bitcoin soon increased dramatically, before a hardline policy saw its exchange sector all but evaporated last year.It is worth noting that unlike banks, the decentralized Bitcoin network operates 24/7 with 99.98% uptime since its inception, according to monitoring resource Bitcoin-uptime."

Designed usually as peer-to-peer payment platforms, cryptocurrencies seek to improve trust, security and privacy by significantly reducing or eliminating third parties. However, by connecting users directly, cryptocurrencies make regulatory oversight far more complex. ","The regulatory control that most governments seek is generally related to money laundering and illegal activity. While cryptocurrency creators have no desire to foster such practices, many nevertheless hope to move away from the sorts of regulatory controls that are seen as centralized, less cost-efficient and often domineering. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg’s newest offering to the tech world is a proprietary cryptocurrency called Libra. Designed as a means of P2P payments on the Facebook platform, Zuckerberg had hoped that his creation would mimic Bitcoin to a degree.Initially the response from insiders was a sense of profound excitement. A host of tech giants signed on financial partners. The news was all about how Libra could change the world, particularly the 1.7 billion adults who remain unbanked across the globe. However, as government agencies have begun offering feedback, the fires have cooled substantially. Most recently, Lael Brainard, one of the governors of the United States Federal Reserve, has stated unequivocally that Libra cannot see the light of day until a number of regulatory standards have been met. What’s more, other analysts have made even stronger statements about the dangers of Libra, and the potential it has to damage society.Related: After 6 Hours of Zuckerberg Testimony, Congress Still Hates LibraThe result has been a massive exodus from the system. Seven of the largest funding partners — including PayPal, Visa, Mastercard and eBay — have all made a hasty retreat from the company. And others are threatening to do the same, as U.S. and international regulators, like the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) continue to clamp down on the new system by offering stricter guidelines on how digital transactions should be managed. One major concern of regulators is that Libra could heavily disrupt the global financial system and potentially be subverted for money laundering or terrorist financing.While not immediately impactful for Bitcoin, this new guidance from the Federal Reserve suggests that coins that do not offer good regulatory control may come under fire. For example, privacy coins like Monero and Dash are under serious scrutiny. These coins offer users complete anonymity in transactions through the use of blockchain technology — a particularly odious feature for regulators. However, while this gap between privacy-based cryptocurrencies and regulators appears to be growing increasingly wide, other coins and platforms have moved into the space, hoping to provide solutions that are meaningful and helpful for regulators.Related: What Role Should Central Banks Have Launching Stablecoins Like Libra?For that reason, platforms such as Particl and Verge, for example, are coming online that allow exchanges to offer some level of regulatory oversight, but still maintain the desired privacy and P2P transactions that cryptocurrency users are pursuing. As a community governance example, Particl is designed with internal regulation, in that it allows for private transactions but also a secondary level of internal governance through user voting. By allowing users to vote against listings that don't conform to the community guidelines, the system is internally regulating. This type of solution offers a middle road between regulators seeking some level of control and the complete anonymity of coins like Zcash and Monero.Other platforms are also seeking solutions that mix private and public transactions. For example, Dash offers private internal transactions between users but requires the coins to be “mixed” with other coins to provide the desired privacy. The founders believe the network should be able to meet the necessary compliance suggestions from FATF.According to Dash CEO Ryan Taylor, “Dash is identical to Bitcoin and is 100% capable of meeting the requirements.”Others, like DeepOnion, are moving in the opposite direction, building on The Onion Router, or TOE, darknet and moving away from any oversight whatsoever. These platforms assume that government will never allow private-style transactions, and are therefore moving underground. While the potential to hide from government will always be there, it seems clear that digital coins that seek a middle ground with regulators pose the greatest hope for mass adoption of cryptocurrencies. New systems that offer a certain level of control (even if only through users) but remain private, allow for a hybrid option that may well represent the future of digital money.Related: What Does Skepticism for Libra Say About Bitcoin?Such systems bring regulators and cryptophiles together. Facebook has promised to work tirelessly with regulators to help bridge the gaps that currently exist. But the departure of its key funding and supportive partners may tell a different story. What’s more, while the coin may offer some benefits for users, other decentralized platforms adhere more carefully to Satoshi Nakamoto’s original vision of a peer-to-peer, digital payment system that is fully decentralized but also highly scalable, safe and secure. While companies have executed permutations of Satoshi’s original vision, most would not deny that clear, consistent and reasonable regulation is required for mass adoption of cryptocurrencies. But ultimately, the cryptocurrencies and systems that do the best job of finding a middle ground between their benefits and regulatory oversight will be the ones that survive and thrive.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.Eric Doyle is an independent tech marketing and PR consultant with nearly 20 years of experience with enterprise and consumer tech brands, including blockchain, fintech, ad tech, AI, e-commerce and entertainment industries"

Bitcoin ...","Oct 25, 2019",A professor at Stanford Graduate School of Business says cryptocurrencies will put an end to the windfall that banks currently enjoy from low-interest deposits.,"In an Oct 24 interview for the university,  Dean Witter Distinguished Professor of Finance Darrell Duffies said that one way or another, cryptocurrencies are likely to upend banks’ business model within the next decade.Professor Duffie said the public should not be misled by the relatively still-low levels of adoption of decentralized cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC); nor should they take the pushback against Facebook’s Libra as the sign of a moratorium on major private initiatives.“The future is coming, and it will be very disruptive to legacy banks that don’t get with the program,” he said.Whether it in the form of a dollar-backed stablecoin, a Facebook product, or a central bank digital currency, the benefits of the digital asset model will likely mean that banks lose their access to lucrative low-interest deposits within ten years, he said, adding: “New payment methods will trigger greater competition for deposits. If consumers have faster ways of paying their bills, and merchants can get faster access to their sales revenue without needing a bank, they won’t want to keep as much money in accounts that pay extremely low interest.”As the report notes, consumers and businesses currently store around $14 trillion in deposits with United States banks alone that pay out an extremely low rate of interest on average.Banks currently pay less than 0.1% interest on checking and savings accounts, and only a slightly higher rate on one-year certificates of deposit. Meanwhile, the amount banks receive from routine overnight loans has climbed from 0.3% in 2015 to over 2% in 2019.This dependence on deposit accounts to process payments by the vast majority of the population ensures huge profits for banks. In addition, banks charge high fees from credit card vendors — a cost that is mostly then passed on to the consumer. Different models for future central bank digital currencies could also develop in ways that would bypass commercial banks for at least part of the payment process. And if adoption is driven by the private sector — as with Libra, due to the unprecedented scale effects it has — it could have a huge impact on the status quo. He argued that the current system is not sustainable and that technology, economics and public pressure will wrest control of the global payment system away from banks.“The smartest banks will be on the front edge of this, but others will be reluctant to cannibalize their very profitable franchises,” he said. To those banks that are slow on the mark, he cautioned:“The future is coming, and it’s not good.”"

Xi made the comments at a Politburo Committee session on blockchain technology trends on Oct. 24.,"Xi stressed that the implementation of integrated blockchain technologies is key in promoting technological innovation and transforming industries. He told the committee:“We must take blockchain as an important breakthrough for independent innovation of core technologies, clarify the main directions, increase investment, focus on a number of key technologies, and accelerate the development of blockchain and industrial innovation.”Xi’s push for greater blockchain adoption comes against the backdrop of China’s long-standing aversion to — and a crackdown on — cryptocurrencies. Authorities in the country first banned ICOs in 2017, quickly followed by cryptocurrency exchanges.There have even been reports that at least one government agency is considering a ban on cryptocurrency mining.Unsurprisingly, the one cryptocurrency that the Chinese government doesn’t seem to have an issue with is its proposed central bank digital currency (CBDC). Despite reports throughout the summer that the launch of this was imminent, officials from China’s Central Bank last month said that there was no timetable for the launch of the CBDC.Meanwhile, Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg has been referencing the threat of Chinese superiority in the digital currency space in an attempt to sell U.S. lawmakers his plans for the Libra stablecoin.""China is moving quickly to launch a similar idea in the coming months. We can't sit here and assume that because America is today the leader that it will always get to be the leader if we don't innovate,” he argued in an official statement. "

Bitcoin? The problem with this argument is that it pits a state-backed ...","Oct 25, 2019","On Oct. 23, Mark Zuckerberg, founder and CEO of social media platform Facebook, appeared before the U.S. House Financial Services Committee to testify on the prospective global cryptocurrency Libra, which his company is backing. He ended up enduring almost six hours of mostly critical questioning, as some of the legislators used the occasion to raise their concerns about many problematic aspects of Zuckerberg’s social media empire, even those not directly related to the cryptocurrency’s operation.","Those who expected the hearings to shed light on many substantive questions regarding Libra’s design and regulatory status that remain unanswered were likely left disappointed. Some observers noted that Zuckerberg was overall successful in achieving his tactical goal, which was to take the beating with humility while getting his main talking points across and making sure to dodge controversial questions. The exchange, however, did not result in much clarity with regard to Libra’s standing with regulators and its overall prospects. As Rep. Patrick McHenry summarized at the end of the hearing, “I’m not sure we’ve learned anything new here.”Indeed, many things that were conspicuous throughout the hearing were already known: that Congress is deeply suspicious of Facebook’s cryptocurrency initiative in the light of the company’s record of high-profile controversies, that some legislators would prefer to break the company up rather than allow it to extend its power into the domain of finance, and that no one fully understands the potential effects of Libra’s launch on the global financial system. If there was anything new in Zuckerberg’s testimony and responses, it was the selection of persuasive tools and the scope of concessions that he appeared willing to make.This was the first Libra hearing for the Facebook boss — previously, it was David Marcus, the head of the forthcoming crypto wallet Calibra, who was dispatched to be grilled on the Hill. As the project seemed to have hit a regulatory wall, Zuckerberg has apparently come to the conclusion that the matter requires his personal attention. The chair of the House Financial Services, Rep. Maxine Waters, welcomed Facebook’s CEO with a rather unequivocal statement in her opening remarks: “As I have examined Facebook's various problems, I have come to the conclusion that it would be beneficial for all if Facebook concentrates on addressing its many existing deficiencies and failures before proceeding any further on the Libra project.”Many of Waters’s Democratic colleagues, who subsequently took the stage, appeared similarly hostile to Libra and Facebook more generally from the outset. They challenged Zuckerberg on a wide array of issues: personal data breaches, discriminatory ad targeting, lack of commitment to diversity, among many others. Rep. Brad Sherman of California invoked the classic “cryptocurrency for criminals” argument, saying: “You’re trying to help those for whom the dollar is not a good currency — drug dealers, terrorists.”Anticipating that, Facebook’s CEO heavily emphasized the patriotic frame, seeking to win sympathies of those concerned with maintaining America’s global influence. He suggested that Libra is the kind of fintech innovation that the U.S. needs in order to stand up to the emerging threat of China’s digital yuan.Related: Digital Yuan: Weapon in US Trade War or Attempt to Manipulate Bitcoin?The problem with this argument is that it pits a state-backed digital currency against one relying on a network of corporate backers. Even to the most hawkish legislators, it may not sound convincing that in order to compete with the Chinese digital currency for global markets, the U.S. should put its faith in Libra, which some believe is itself a potential competitor to the dollar.Naturally, this line of reasoning led to the question: Why not just create a digital version of the dollar? Zuckerberg responded that it would be less attractive to global consumers than a currency backed by a diverse basket of assets. Importantly, he also stated that he would be open to regulations mandating Libra to be majority-backed by the U.S. dollar.Another central theme that Zuckerberg dwelled on was drawing a solid line between Facebook and Libra to convince committee members that the two are distinct entities, and that Facebook will not have any more power over Libra than any other member of the association. He also doubled down on the reassurances that Facebook will not initiate the launch of the cryptocurrency unless it gets all the necessary approvals from U.S. regulators.In illustrating this point, Zuckerberg went as far as to envision a scenario where other members of the Libra Association decide to proceed without securing U.S. authorities’ permission, in which case Facebook would have to pull from the project – something that sounds as realistic as, say, the United Kingdom leaving the Commonwealth.At the same time, the testimony added nothing to the overall understanding of Zuckerberg’s views on what specific regulations should apply to Libra. His responses to specific questions regarding regulation and governance of the Libra Association conspicuously lacked detail, which didn’t help in winning representatives’ endorsements.While some Republican committee members praised Zuckerberg’s entrepreneurial achievements and drive for innovation, not a single one voiced support for Libra during the hearing.  Perhaps McHenry, the ranking member on the House Financial Services Committee, came the closest in calling for a measured approach to the initiative. Just ahead of the hearing, he expressed concern over the possibility that lawmakers may be stifling innovation that they do not fully understand: “My fear is that we now have American innovation on trial by policymakers here in Washington because they don’t understand it. […] Because they’re a big company doing this type of innovation, you have American policymakers trying to pounce on them. This also sends a chilling signal to innovation in the United States.”This sentiment echoes what some of the crypto industry stakeholders have to say on the matter. Patrick McLain, co-founder of San Francisco-based blockchain accelerator MouseBelt, thinks that the hearings are indicative of the legislators’ stance on cryptocurrencies at large and are not about Facebook or Libra:“This is the government putting the very concept of cryptocurrency on trial. Today, lawmakers have drawn a line in the sand that says, ‘Cryptocurrency is unwelcome in the United States, and we will do everything in our power to stop it — including villainize some of the world’s best innovators.’ But cryptocurrency is a borderless and immutable movement that can’t be stopped. Libra may not survive, but something else will.”While some of the issues that members of Congress take with the Libra project are legitimate, others belong to the realm of prejudices that have been refuted by respectable research, suggesting that McHenry might have a point. Tom Robinson, chief scientist and co-founder of blockchain forensics firm Elliptic, told Cointelegraph that the fears of Libra being used by criminals and terrorists are overblown, as it will not prove to be a useful tool for them:“Libra transactions will be transparent and traceable. Law enforcement around the world have repeatedly demonstrated that cryptocurrencies are not safe havens for criminals, because they’re able to trace transactions and identify the individuals behind darknet markets, ransomware attacks and other bad actors. A shift toward crypto-assets would have the opposite effect that is being suggested by many politicians because AML technology is easier and more effective in tracing crypto transactions than fiat.”In sum, regulatory pushback against Libra is fueled both by Facebook’s trust problem and regulators’ lack of understanding of the project’s mechanics and potential effects. While Zuckerberg pledged to comply with all regulations that U.S. government deems necessary to give Libra the green light, he offered little in the way of a comprehensive vision of what such framework may look like. Given the gravity of legislators’ concerns, appealing to the threat of Chinese digital currency competition is unlikely to sway a significant number of lawmakers. After Wednesday’s hearing, the odds of Libra ever seeing the light of day are still unclear, and the project will remain in regulatory limbo until the negotiating parties arrive at a more specific action plan."

The statement seeks to establish the company as a “victim of fraud” and to deny potential accusations of illegal activity by Bitfinex.In the statement, Bitfinex claimed that any allegation that Crypto Capital, which is a former Bitfinex’s payment processor, laundered any illicit funds upon request of Bitfinex or its customers is “categorically false.” The exchange wrote:“This week's developments do nothing to affect or otherwise deter Bitfinex's claims to funds in Poland or anywhere else. We will continue to work to recover all funds for and on behalf of our stakeholders.”As reported, Ivan Manuel Molina Lee, the president of Crypto Capital was arrested by Polish authorities allegedly in relation to involvement in money laundering through cryptocurrencies for facilitating international drug cartels. Specifically, Molina Lee was reportedly detained on the basis of a European Arrest Warrant in connection to $350 million that were previously seized by the Polish Ministry of Justice. As a major crypto payment processor, Crypto Capital reportedly served industry-known crypto exchanges in the past, including Binance, Kraken, BitMEX as well as Bitfinex.As previously reported, Crypto Capital is allegedly responsible for Bitfinex’s loss of $880 million. On Oct. 18, Bitfinex’s parent company IFinex filed a discovery application to regain access to over $880 million in funds tied to Crypto Capital, alleging that simply did not keep the fund of Bitfinex’s clients.In the recent statement, Bitfinex noted that Crypto Capital processed certain funds for and on behalf of Bitfinex for several years. The exchange elaborated that at the time, Bitfinex was relying upon representations from Crypto Capital, including those by Molina Lee and another exec Oz Yosef (Oz Joseph), which eventually turned out to be misleading. Bitfinex said:“Among those misrepresentations, Crypto Capital regularly referred to its integrity, banking expertise, robust compliance programme and financial licences. This was designed to assure us that Crypto Capital was capable of handling Bitfinex's transactions.”Another principal, Oz Yosef, has reportedly been indicted on three criminal counts by the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, according to Bitfinex."

Pay-to-Play Gaming Is Flawed, Blockchain-Based Platform Says.","Oct 26, 2019","Over the past week, the global crypto community bore witness to a unique case wherein California resident and blockchain entrepreneur Seth Shapiro filed a lawsuit against American telecom giant AT&T — alleging that a couple of the firm’s employees had perpetrated a nefarious SIM-swap scheme that resulted in the former losing $1.8 million in various crypto assets.","Shapiro, who is a two-time Emmy Award-winner, as well as an author and adjunct professor at the University of Southern California School of Cinematic Arts, filed the aforementioned lawsuit against AT&T on Oct. 17, claiming that between May 16, 2018 and May 18, 2019, the telecom provider’s employees perpetrated four hacks in total that lead to his personal and confidential data — including usernames, passwords, event calendar, etc. — being leaked to third-party hackers. In this regard, the submitted court documents highlight that the aforementioned developments resulted in the miscreants gaining control of Shapiro’s various cryptocurrency exchange accounts on platforms, such as KuCoin, Bittrex, Coinbase, Huobi, Cryptopia, Livecoin, HitBTC, Coss.io, Liqui and Bitfinex. Not only that, but they were also able to seize control of some of his other digital accounts, such as Evernote.In addition, the plaintiff has also alleged that he is currently in possession of chat logs that clearly show the AT&T employees and hackers discussing their plans to use the stolen funds to acquire their dream cars and other valuable objects. The logs also contain details of how the hackers planned on rerouting the funds to avoid being caught by the police. On the subject, the lawsuit reads as follows:“AT&T employees obtained unauthorized access to Mr. Shapiro’s AT&T wireless account, viewed his confidential and proprietary personal information, and transferred control [...] to a phone controlled by third-party hackers in exchange for money. [...] The hackers then utilized their control over Mr. Shapiro’s AT&T wireless number [...] to access his personal and digital finance accounts and steal more than $1.8 million.”Jim Greer, an AT&T assistant vice president for corporate communications, told Cointelegraph in a statement: “We are working closely with our industry, law enforcement and consumers to stop and prevent this type of crime.”To gain a better understanding of the situation, Cointelegraph reached out to Shapiro and asked him to share some comments regarding the matter. First, Cointelegraph wanted verified whether Shapiro had indeed made repeated attempts to get AT&T’s service operators to prioritize his calls in order to protect his account. Additionally, Cointelegraph also asked him why he failed to notify local police authorities immediately after the first hack — after all, it has been alleged that a total of four breaches took place. Shapiro responded to this by saying:“I did. There’s not much local PDs can do — AT&T has all the information. In my case, I was lucky that the REACT Task force in Santa Clara got a lead and pursued the case. As did the Department of Homeland Security, who have been amazing. I am very grateful to both groups and can give you contacts at each.”  When asked about the crypto assets that were lost as a result of the repeated intrusions, Dwayne Sam — an attorney at Pierce Bainbridge Beck Price & Hecht LLP — and a member of Shapiro’s legal team, provided a legal document that contained the following data:In all, Shapiro alleged that he has had to face a total loss of around $1.7 million in cryptocurrency — $1 million of which consists solely of his personal funds, which he said was savings for his retirement.It should be mentioned that AT&T has had a poor track record when it comes to SIM-swapping incidents, with occurrences more than doubling between January 2013 and 2016. Also, in an earlier case relatively similar to this one — Terpin v. AT&T — a United States court did lay some responsibility on the claimant for failing to secure the account adequately. Thus, when asked if Shapiro’s legal team expected to face similar responsibility from the judge presiding over their case, Sam replied by saying:“Mr. Shapiro’s case will be judged on its own merits. That said, nothing in the Terepin court’s most recent decision could or should be construed as blaming the victim.”Lastly, when asked about how the legal team foresees the judgment of his case panning out in court Shapiro pointed out:“The evidence in this case of AT&T’s culpability and negligence is overwhelming. We fully anticipate that AT&T will be held legally accountable for its actions and those of its employees.”     AT&T’s Greer told Cointelegraph that the company has security measures in place to combat fraudulent SIM swapping, adding:“However, recent high profile cases reinforce the importance of businesses and consumers taking steps to protect against SIM swap fraud, such as not using mobile phone numbers as the single source of security and authentication.Greer went on to say that the company believes what happened to Shapiro is unfortunate, but added: “We dispute his allegations. We look forward to presenting our case in court.”To better understand if the responsibility in relation to this matter lies with AT&T alone or with the firm’s employees who reportedly stole Shapiro’s data, Cointelegraph got in touch with David Reischer, an attorney and CEO of LegalAdvice. He responded by saying Shapiro’s allegation that AT&T being in violation of the Federal Communications Act is absolutely true — especially in regard to the firm failing to protect the confidentiality of his mobile telephone account and other related data. He then went on to add:“AT&T is liable for its employees criminal acts via a theory of vicarious liability that holds a company accountable for the acts of its employees. The chat logs introduced into evidence by Mr. Shapiro further detail the scheme to steal Mr. Shapiro's cryptocurrency and AT&T is equally negligent for not protecting Mr. Shapiro against this scheme and fraud.”Similarly, another important facet is whether or not the issue of contributory negligence arises — i.e., would Shapiro’s activities qualify as contributing to the damage, as he should have known not to use a SIM card as an authenticating factor. On the subject, Jonathan Klinger, an Israeli cyber law attorney and blogger, told Cointelegraph:“It is also quite hard to believe that such a material amount of funds were held in an account that merely needed these factors. One should expect the protection of personal data to be proportionate to the amount of funds that he might lose. In this case, these factors weigh in favor of AT&T. Shapiro has a long way ahead before he might get any compensation, in my opinion.""It is also worth remembering that SIM swapping is a relatively new type of fraud that has been growing at a rapid pace over the past decade or so — especially in the wake of the recent crypto boom. Related: Grand Theft Crypto: The State of Cryptocurrency-Stealing Malware and Other Nasty TechniquesThus, investments made through smartphones, laptops and other digital devices are now prone to certain third-party interference, which one needs to be wary of at all times. On the subject, Alina Kiselevich, a communication specialist with a legal background at Enigma Securities, pointed out to Cointelegraph that, “Mr. Shapiro did everything that a responsible client should do” by repeatedly reporting an attack to AT&T and seeking help from the telecoms company:“As you can see, it was impossible for Shapiro to call the police, because it did not happen between long periods of time, but rather very quickly. Robert Jack and Jarratt White, two people standing behind the theft from AT&T’s side, were confirmed to be employed there, their involvement in the case was also confirmed.”Terpin v. AT&T Mobility: Last year, Michael Terpin, a prominent cryptocurrency advocate and the founder of Marketwire, was the victim of SIM swap fraud involving AT&T. He filed a lawsuit against the firm in August 2018, later winning $75.8 million in a civil judgment — even though AT&T filed for a dismissal of the lawsuit, the plea was eventually overruled by the court.Liu v. AT&T: On Feb. 12, 2018, after Mitch Liu's smartphone started malfunctioning, he immediately went to an AT&T store and spoke to the customer care representative, revealing his Social Security number as proof of identification. He was then provided with a new SIM card, which, once installed, allowed hackers to obtain control of his cell phone data. On March 19, 2018, Liu received a message stating that his social media and cryptocurrency exchange accounts had been compromised, and that a total of $10,000 worth of crypto assets had been moved from his wallets.Sidhu v. AT&T: As per court documents recently obtained by Cointelegrah, early last year, AT&T user Jagdeep Sidhu started experiencing issues with his cell phone. He subsequently acquired a new SIM card and upon restarting his phone, Sidhu immediately realized that his Gmail, Coinbase, Facebook and Instagram accounts had been compromised. Basu v. AT&T: On Aug. 27, 2018, REACT investigators confirmed that an unknown individual was able to gain control of Saswata Basu’s phone and steal his AT&T cell phone account via a SIM swap. Shortly afterward, his Yahoo and Gmail addresses were accessed without authorization. In all, it is estimated that Basu lost around 9,000 DASH and 1,287 ETH.Hui v. AT&T: According to legal data acquired by Cointelegraph, on Nov. 20, 2017, Tina Hui tried to log into her Gmail account only to be told that she had changed her password four hours prior. Upon seeing the message, she immediately sent in a request for a password reset and waited for a two-factor authentication text message to arrive. However, when the message did not come, Hui realized that her cell phone might have been compromised. She rushed to an AT&T store to rectify the issue, but by then, a number of her personal accounts, including her Coinbase wallet, had been hacked into."

layers like mesh radios and SMS.” Meanwhile, the Republic of the ...","Oct 26, 2019",The Central Bank of the Bahamas (CBOB) is planning to release its own fiat digital currency in order to ensure economies’ resilience in the event of a natural disaster.,"CBOB governor John Rolle made the statement during his speech at the Counsellors Limited’s Exuma Business Outlook at Sandals Emerald Bay, local news publication the Nassau Guardian reported on Oct. 25. According to Rolle, digital currency has the ability to free the country from dependency on cash — particularly useful after a natural disaster.The digital currency is being developed under the auspices of Project Sand Dollar and will be the Bahamas’ first digital fiat currency. The currency is expected to be accompanied by an associated digital wallet and a card that will contain identical information. Rolle explained:“It would permit wireless restoration of payments connectively, avoiding the cash shipment and cash handling frustrations. It would permit electronic dispersing of aid and allow families to recapture personal dignity by restoring the flexibility to prioritize the elements of personal need that they prefer to satisfy post-disasters.”Rolle noted that following the recent hurricane, the country’s banking sector saw significant damage to the physical structures of Abaco and Grand Bahamas, which led local banks to shut down operations.Indeed, weeks and even months after a natural disaster like a hurricane, power grids in affected areas remain inoperative. More than 11 months after Hurricane Maria, some places in Puerto Rico were still without electricity.Commenting on the potential impact of practical offline crypto transaction solutions, Richard Myers, a decentralized applications engineer at Global Mesh Labs and goTenna, told Cointelegraph:“In many parts of the rural and developing world internet connectivity is both expensive and intermittent. More solutions tailored to these situations would certainly facilitate the use of cryptocurrencies in places where it is needed. Bitcoin transactions can be made over alternative low-bandwidth transport layers like mesh radios and SMS.”Meanwhile, the Republic of the Marshall Islands is also developing its national digital currency as a way to eliminate the country’s dependence on the United States dollar, which it has been using for decades."

Crypto Platform Sees Its User Base Grow Amid the Global Pandemic.","Oct 25, 2019",The World Economic Forum (WEF) and seven major mining and metals firms are partnering to develop responsible sourcing and sustainability practices using blockchain.,"The Global Mining Review reported details of the new “Mining and Metals Blockchain Initiative” on Oct. 25. The seven partners, together with the WEF, plan to pool their resources to experiment with, design and deploy joint proofs-of-concept as part of an inclusive blockchain platform.Rather than acting individually, the initiative aims to foster industry-wide trust through mutual cooperation and to tackle inadequate standardization and prevent fragmentation in the sector.An industry-wide blockchain initiative has the potential to help the industry both to increase transparency and efficiency and to improve the reporting of carbon emissions, the report notes.Members will reportedly examine issues related to governance, develop case studies and establish a working group. Key areas of collaboration and development will include carbon emissions tracking and supply chain transparency — with projects to tackle provenance tracking, chain of custody and production methods.Jörgen Sandström, Head of the Mining and Metals Industry at the WEF, has given a statement outlining that:“Material value chains are undergoing profound change and disruption. The industry needs to respond to the increasing demands of minerals and materials while responding to increasing demands by consumers, shareholders and regulators for a higher degree of sustainability and traceability of the products.”Alongside the WEF, the initiative’s members are Antofagasta Minerals, the Eurasian Resources Group, Glencore International AG, Klöckner & Co., Tata Steel Ltd. and Tracr, which represents AngloAmerican and De Beers.International regulators and NGOs are also expected to provide input for the firms’ collaborative development of blockchain solutions for the industry.This summer, the WEF published a Blockchain Value Framework guide advising global businesses to invest time in understanding blockchain technology, identifying incentives and accounting for potential risks, and to align its implementation with their strategic priorities.At the end of May, the WEF had announced the formation of six separate “Fourth Industrial Revolution” councils to work on new technology policy guidance.Ahead of today’s industry-wide venture, bilateral blockchain projects in the mining and metals sector have included a Tracr pilot for De Beers and Russia’s Alrosa — the world’s largest diamond mining firm."

Bitcoin ETN Hits $100 Mln, Partners With Xapo. Cointelegraph ...","Oct 25, 2019","Prediction markets are one of the most interesting platforms that have become associated with blockchain technology. However, they are not without fault, with some even having to deal with intrigues and lawsuits.","Additionally, prediction markets suffer from having bad user experience (UX) and sluggish payouts. On top of it, some that cater to more general subjects suffer from having unquantifiable and arbitrary results.Nevertheless, a new player emerges with its next-generation features and sleek interface. Introducing Bispex, the one-stop cryptocurrency prediction market platform.Bispex is a prediction market service that focuses on cryptocurrency price changes. Based in Seychelles, the project aims to provide a go-to place for making predictions regarding future cryptocurrency price changes and the overall market status.At the helm of the operations is CEO Ashish Babar, a young blockchain-savvy entrepreneur. Mr. Babar is joined by other talented and seasoned experts, which are CTO Mike Kwon, CSO Desiree Yoo, and CMO Patrick Chun. Together, they form the executive body of Bispex.Despite scores of already-existing prediction markets today, there aren’t as many that are dedicated entirely to cryptocurrency price changes. The project believes that this is a very thrilling subject, especially that cryptocurrencies are decentralized, thus having frequent price fluctuations.According to Mr. Babar, one of the problems commonly faced by prediction market sites is the scarcity of information that centres on user behaviour and preferences. This is caused by the lack of proper tools and fewer users who could have otherwise helped to improve their UX.Bispex gathers price information fed by a number of reputable cryptocurrency listing websites and other credible entities to make sure that the prediction results will not be manipulated by anyone with a particular bias or ulterior motive.Aside from providing the sheer thrill of making accurate predictions, the founders believe that Bispex will be able to improve the cryptocurrency industry. Having a prediction market that focuses on cryptocurrency price will entice cryptocurrency enthusiasts, including professional crypto traders, into the competition.These traders can provide professional inputs, allowing new traders to understand the market better. In turn, this will help the latter to refrain from making unwise decisions that can cause them to lose money. Furthermore, prediction markets could inadvertently become survey sites that show the overall mood or opinion of many in cryptocurrency trading circles at a specific moment.Bispex is developing its own token, which it is looking to be listed on multiple exchanges in November. Aside from the prediction market, the platform is also considering having a cryptocurrency exchange service in the future. This exchange will allow spot trading, trade mining, and margin trading for its users.Mr. Babar said in a statement:“We’re the new contenders [in the prediction market sector], but we’ll make sure to be at the top. An accurate prediction market with fast asset liquidation — you can bet on it with Bispex.”Interested bettors can follow Bispex through its official Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, and Telegram to know the latest developments from the platform."
24,https://cointelegraph.com,"Oct 25, 2019",Privacy-Focused Cryptos Hunted Down by Forensics and Exchanges,https://cointelegraph.com/news/privacy-focused-cryptos-hunted-down-by-forensics-and-exchanges,"... “First National Risk Analysis 2018/2019,” stating that the growing 
usage of Monero on the darknet makes it more dangerous than Bitcoin.","Oct 25, 2019","As Japan and South Korea — two of the largest cryptocurrency exchange markets in Asia — are increasingly pressuring exchanges to delist privacy-focused crypto assets, and concerns are rising that it could lead to more markets, at least in Asia, to follow the trend of the two major countries.","Meanwhile, Blockchain analytics firms like CypherTrace appear to be developing technologies to better understand the structure of privacy-focused coins and to trace transactions initiated by cryptocurrencies. Speaking to Cointelegraph, a spokesperson for CypherTrace said that the company expects to see some progress by 2020 on privacy coins, stating, “We look forward to some results on privacy coins in 2020.”But as things stand, analytics firms are still not close to finding a solution for tracing transactions processed by some privacy coins like Monero, which may make it more difficult for privacy coins to remain listed on strictly regulated exchanges that support fiat pairs.Japan and South Korea have essentially imposed a blanket ban on privacy-focused cryptocurrencies like Monero (XMR), Zcash (ZEC) and Dash (DASH), which, officers at the Japanese Financial Services Agency like to describe as the “three anonymous siblings.”Throughout the past year, the G-7, an organization consisting of the seven largest economies, and the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), which operates under the G-7, have shown efforts to unify basic regulatory frameworks surrounding cryptocurrencies.With the push of Japan, both the G-7 and the FATF and have pressured major markets to take action against privacy coins, leading large exchanges like UPbit and OKEx to delist Monero, Dash, Zcash and several other cryptocurrencies. On Sept. 10, OKEx Korea said in an official statement translated by Cointelegraph:“According to the statement corresponding to FATF R.16, […] We have decided to take measures to end trading support for stocks classified as privacy-oriented cryptocurrencies, aka dark coins.”As reported by Cointelegraph, UPbit, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in South Korea by volume, also delisted privacy coins due to money laundering concerns. UPbit said in a statement, “The decision to end trading support for the crypto-asset was also made to block the possibility of money laundering and inflow from external networks.”Related: FATF AML Regulation: Can the Crypto Industry Adapt to the Travel Rule?Cryptocurrency exchanges in Japan and South Korea planned to support the stance of their respective governments to prohibit the trading of privacy coins prior to the meetings held by the FATF. However, the FATF released a document following its second plenary meeting entitled, “Outcomes FATF Plenary, 20–22 February 2019,” explicitly stating that entities described as virtual asset service providers will have to comply to the revisioned requirements of the FATF Standards.The revised requirements for virtual asset service providers could make it mandatory for all regulated exchanges located in G-7 countries to discard support for privacy coins, creating a more difficult environment to trade the digital assets.Regulated exchanges in the United States like Coinbase and Gemini have not supported privacy coins since their inception, with the exception of Zcash in the case of Gemini. It remains unclear whether Zcash can be considered a privacy coin, as it provides users the option of processing transactions that are not private.To process private transactions of Zcash, shielded transactions have to be initiated, and on most exchanges and wallets, shielded Zcash transactions are not processed. Due to the ability of Zcash to comply with local regulations, Gemini has supported Zcash since May 2018, and management at the Electric Coin Company has said on several occasions that ECC is working with OKEx and other South Korean exchanges to list Zcash.For privacy coins that purely focus on being private, like Monero for instance, it may not be possible for blockchain analytics firms to establish an efficient method of tracing transactions. As a CypherTrace spokesperson told Cointelegraph:“Monero in particular has a very privacy focused technology including ring signatures and mixing.  Most coins have a much more transparent blockchain and are not actively trying to prevent analysis.”Hence, for Monero and a select few other privacy coins, at least in the foreseeable future, regulated cryptocurrency exchanges that either don’t support privacy coins or have already delisted privacy coins are highly unlikely to list them again.The Federal Ministry of Finance of Germany, which is a member of the G-7, released a report at the end of October entitled, “First National Risk Analysis 2018/2019,” stating that the growing usage of Monero on the darknet makes it more dangerous than Bitcoin. The report says:“Due to the increasing popularity of Monero on the Darknet, it can be foreseen that this crypto asset, especially, will gain more practical relevance in the future in the area of securing and exploitation.”It did not single out Monero, adding that other privacy coins like Zcash can also be used to launder money. The growing pressure from G-7 countries for exchanges to deal with privacy coins will further push the FATF to apply guidelines and standards to prevent money laundering, making it harder for exchanges to support privacy coins.Given its selective privacy option that allows users or service providers like exchanges to choose whether to implement private transactions or not, combined with the support from a top U.S. cryptocurrency exchange in Gemini, Zcash seemingly has the best chance of being listed by exchanges operating in G-7 countries.Gemini is able to process Zcash transactions with the approval from the New York Department of Financial Services likely because it only supports withdrawals for non-shielded transactions.Like how Gemini supports Zcash, the FATF may likely require exchanges to be able to monitor and trace transactions as needed before privacy coins can be listed on major exchanges. Without such solutions, maintaining compliance with the FATF’s requirements could prove too challenging, particularly since they became stricter following the organization’s second plenary meeting in February 2019.Earlier this year, in February 2019, Kimberly Grauer at the crypto analytics form Chainalysis said that Monero is a top priority for the firm, and tweeted, “We can easily track the funds in and out of a DNM [darknet market]. If you ever want to convert your crypto into fiat, you’ll have to go through an exchange, which will force you to KYC, so there’s still hope.”However, if Monero is delisted from exchanges and trades begin to be processed in a peer-to-peer manner, it will become almost impossible for blockchain analytics firms to find the identity behind the Monero transactions. Therefore, delisting of Monero from exchanges could hurt the chances of analytics firms tracing funds involved in criminal activities."
