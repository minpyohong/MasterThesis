earlier today, but the breakout into $10,000 was short-lived.","Oct 26, 2019 at 10:34 UTC","Bitcoin’s price was quoted in five digits across cryptocurrency exchanges earlier today, but the breakout into $10,000 was short-lived.","The number one cryptocurrency by market value jumped to $10,350 at 01:45 UTC – the highest level since Sept. 24 – according to Bitstamp data. Meanwhile, the global average price, as calculated by CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index, clocked a high of $10,332.Just 24 hours ago, the cryptocurrency was reeling under bearish pressures below $7,500 and prominent chart analysts were calling a deeper drop, courtesy of the so-called “death cross” – a bearish cross of long-term moving averages.BTC, however, picked up a bid around $7,500 in the early U.S. trading hours on Friday and rose to $8,800 at 17:20 UTC. Prices then consolidated in the narrow range of $8,500 to $8,700 for a few hours, before printing highs above $10,000 earlier today. Essentially, the death cross trapped sellers on the wrong side for the fourth time since 2014.Bitcoin closed (UTC) at $8,662 on Friday, representing a 16.51 percent gain on the day, as per Bitstamp data. That is the biggest single-day rise since April 2. Back then, BTC had rallied 18.45 percent from $4,133 to $5,080.Further, the rise from lows below $7,400 to highs above $10,300 is reportedly the third-largest 24-hour price gain in bitcoin’s history, as pointed out by crypto-asset analyst Yassine  Elmandjra.Experts have associated the latest double-digit surge with Chinese President Xi Jinping’s comments that the world’s second-largest economy should accelerate its adoption of the blockchain technology. After all, China was one of the biggest sources of demand for cryptocurrencies during the 2017 bull run.Prominent observers like Anthony Pompliano are of the opinion that the Chinese president’s public support of the blockchain technology will force the U.S. and other major nations to embrace the technology, perhaps boosting bitcoin.The investor community, therefore, is expecting the rally to continue. Some observers, however, are worried that the market optimism is premature, as China is developing a digital version of its own currency and is unlikely to lift its ban on bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.It remains to be seen whether Xi’s comments power further gains in BTC. The cryptocurrency is losing altitude at press time.As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $9,320 on Bitstamp, representing a $1,000-plus drop from the Asian session high of $10,350. Technical charts indicate a bullish breakout would be confirmed if prices find acceptance above $9,750.The daily chart shows early signs of a bullish reversal. For instance, bitcoin’s convincing move above $8,352 (Oct. 21 high) has invalidated the bearish lower highs setup. The cryptocurrency has also violated resistance at $8,820 (horizontal line).However, the cryptocurrency is yet to exit the falling channel, represented by trendlines connecting June 26 and Aug. 6 highs and July 17 and Sept. 26 lows.A UTC close above the upper edge of the bearish channel, currently at $9,750, would imply a resumption of the rally from lows near $4,100 seen on April 2 and put the cryptocurrency on the path to re-test of the high of $13,880 hit in June.Put simply, a channel breakout is needed to confirm a bearish-to-bullish trend change.Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.Hot air balloons image via Shutterstock; charts by Trading View"

Earlier this week, the cryptocurrency touched $7,363, the lowest since May 18.Friday’s price jump-started right around 10:15 UTC, right after Xi’s favorable blockchain comments were published in Chinese media.The Chinese president’s statements on blockchain are believed to be his first in-depth remarks on the technology. Chinese officials are developing a digital version of the country’s own currency, but have forbidden other coins from being traded.President Xi said on Thursday:“We must take the blockchain as an important breakthrough for independent innovation of core technologies.”eToro’s Greenspan said that the price jump appeared to be directly correlated with the Chinese leader’s comments.“It seems like this is what investors were reacting to,” Greenspan said. “There’s only so much amount of good news that can be ignored. Xi is one of the most important people in the world.”Bitcoin remains well off its 2019 high of $12,920 reached in June, though prices are still more than double where they started the year.China lion image via Shutterstock"

After all, the 50-day MA responds to the data that is at least 2.5-months old and the 200-day MA is sensitive to 6.5-month old data.BTC topped out at $13,880 on June 26 and fell back to $9,000 in mid-July. The 50-day MA, however, continued to rise and topped out in mid-August, 6 weeks after BTC topped out above $13,800.Meanwhile, the 200-day MA maintained an upward trajectory throughout the sell-off from $13,880 to recent lows below $7,300.Currently, the 200-day MA is sidelined near $8,895 and the 50-day MA is trending south and is now around $8,890.All-in-all, it seems safe to conclude that the death cross is a lagging indicator and happens when most of the correction has already taken place, as tweeted by popular trader @CryptoTutor following the confirmation of the bearish cross on March 31, 2018.As seen above, the April 2014 death cross marked a major bottom in BTC from where the cryptocurrency rallied 100 percent.It’s worth noting the bearish crossovers seen in September 2015 and April 2018 trapped sellers on the wrong side of the market, as discussed last Friday.The latest bear cross poses the same threat, as prices have already dropped more than 45 percent. In fact, BTC is showing signs of life on confirmation of the death cross.At press time, BTC is changing hands at $7,600 on Bitstamp, having picked up a bid near $7,393 earlier today. That said, it is still too early to call a bullish reversal.The range breakdown confirmed on  Wednesday is intact. Further, 5- and 10-day moving averages (MAs) are trending south, indicating a bearish setup. The relative strength index’s (RSI) downside break of the ascending trendline is also a bearish development.BTC, therefore, remains on the hunt for a drop to key support levels at $7,200 (three-day chart 100-candle MA) and $7,000 (three-day chart 200-candle MA).The bearish setup on the daily chart will remain valid as long as prices are holding below the former support-turned-resistance of $7,714.The outlook would turn bullish if and when prices rise above $8,314 (Oct. 21 high). That would also validate the argument that the death cross is a contrary indicator.Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.Bitcoin image via Shutterstock; charts by Trading View"

But the reality is, I think these selloffs are more about lack of money in the system right now. There's just not new money coming in at the moment.""His take? There is no ""buyer of last resort"" in crypto, which means that ""distressed"" assets don't get scooped up.Dorman also commented on the Libra hearings, saying he's not certain they had much effect.""Well, you know, I think retail investors probably aren't spending a lot of time watching C-SPAN,"" he said.You can watch the rest of the interview above or read the transcript below.Brad Keoun: We're here today with Jeff Dorman. He's the chief investment officer of Arca. We're very lucky to have him. He has a long resume of experience. He's a former high-yield bond trader with big firms like Citadel, Merrill Lynch and Friedman, Billings, Ramsey, and lately he's been bringing that experience to bear in the crypto space. Jeff, thank you so much for your time today.Jeff Dorman: Absolutely. Thanks for having me.BK: Yesterday we had a very big move down in bitcoin, and I'd love to get your thoughts there on what happened.JD: Sure, it is always difficult to understand what's causing a price decline or price appreciation. After the fact, you can piece together pieces of news that may have caused it. I think over the last months, not just yesterday, you're definitely seeing some miners selling, which is causing some downward pressure. But the reality is, I think these selloffs are more about lack of money in the system right now. There's just not new money coming in at the moment, and, more importantly, there's no buyer of last resort. In traditional asset classes, you see rotation when equities go to cheap. The distressed bond guys start to buy if distressed bonds or companies by that their own bonds and equities. In crypto, right now, there really is just no buyer of last resort. You're not seeing that rotation yet, so until that until that starts to happen, I think moves up and down are always going to be exacerbated.BK: What's it gonna take for that to happen?JD: It's a good question. I think a lot of it is still the education. I think people are definitely learning. Education is number one. We need to get reputable companies in here who help traditional investors get in here and part of it is simply getting traditional investors to recognize that this really is an asset class that they can you can use for a variety of different purposes, whether that's for hedging with speculation, whether it's for growth.BK: Just sort of anecdotally looking at bitcoin market, and it seems like we'll have these big stair-step moves and then we'll go along in a range, and then we'll have another very large move. I'm curious for people who are kind of kicking the tires on this market. What out of the how did they look at that?JD: I think for the most part, traditional investors are not scared off by volatility as long as there's upside volatility as well right now, but volatility can be managed. There are certainly times when you'll get all sides. There are certainly times where you don't see something coming and you're not hedged or wedged appropriately. For the most part, traditional investors are very good at managing risk, and they're very good at managing volatility so that that's to me, not something that's going to scare people away from this market. I think what will scare them away is not understanding where the volatility is coming from, and I think that's where a lot of the due diligence is going through right now, trying to figure out how it's happening, how they can prevent against it what kind of managers or that they can trust to actually manage that risk for them.BK: What were your thoughts on Mark Zuckerberg's testimony yesterday? And I'm curious if there's any way that sort of maps back to how people think about bitcoin?JD: I think retail investors probably aren't spending a lot of time watching C-SPAN. Certainly traditional institutional investors have that out in the background. So I think it'll certainly shape some narratives in terms of what people take out of it. But me personally, I felt uncomfortable watching it. I don't like when six hours of time is being used and accomplishing very little. I don't think the questions were very good, and as a result, the answers couldn't be very good either. I think it's a good thing that regulation is going to happen, and I think it is a good thing that for good or for bad, the Libra and Facebook project is forcing this into the public narrative faster than maybe it would have otherwise.But in terms of price action, I think a lot of people were excited about Facebook and Libra, which probably contributed to the run-up earlier in the year. And now that that's stalling and not going as well, it's certainly contributing to the downside. But I don't think in a vacuum that that one testimony or anything else that's going on with Libra is really the main driver of crypto.BK: Just looking ahead, a big event next week in traditional finance: The Federal Reserve is gonna have its meeting. And they're expected to cut rates for the third time this year. I don't know if you have any thoughts specifically on what that means for bitcoin in the short term? But maybe long term, any thoughts on on what the Fed is doing?JD: Yeah, the Fed actions to date haven't had much of an impact real time in the price of bitcoin already on any other digital assets except for the July 31 cut. The first cut really did spark a 25 percent rally over the next five days, August 1- August 6, just because it is such a reversal of what had been happening over the last four or five years of going the other way with tighter monetary policy rather than looser long term. So I don't expect next week's cuts to really have an impact. However, you couldn't ask for a better long-term backdrop for bitcoin right now, with anything from what's happening with the QE and all in the repo markets and just constant injections of liquidity, which obviously is going to lead to inflation at some point or just raising the debt ceiling. The political unrest that we're seeing everywhere, from Chile, Argentina, to Lebanon to Hong Kong, low rates everywhere, which is just spurring aggressive investing and obviously creating further bubbles. So long term, I think this is absolutely part of the bitcoin bull thesis. But I wouldn't expect too much of a reaction at all, just based on the rate cut itself.BK: Just a last question here. I was just reading this editorial board piece from Bloomberg earlier this week, and they said that the world economy is quote ""stumbling toward disaster."" And of course you know Michael Bloomberg potentially in the wings of, you know, as a presidential candidate, jumping in. But aside from that, Bloomberg has a lot of credibility and you're a former high-yield bond trader, and one of the things they talked about was how bad it could get in a credit-cycle turn. And I'm just curious, What would that mean for bitcoin if if the U.S. really went into a full-blown downturn?JD: In debt, we're trained to look at downside, not upside, whereas equity guys usually look through rose-colored glasses and look at the upside first.So certainly the people in the debt circles are more concerned about this right now than the equity guys. I think it's a real concern. There are people who, nine years ago, eight years ago were calling for the same demise as people are calling for now and truthfully, nothing has really changed, except for this giant band-aid of liquidity that the Fed and other central banks have put over the problem.So it certainly could get that bad. I don't think the world going into a deep recession or a massive systemic banking failure is going to be good in the beginning for bitcoin. I think correlation goes to one across all risk assets as soon as things get bad. However, long term, it really would be the reminder of why bitcoin exists in the first place. And, you know, a lot of people, especially in the United States, when you're not affected by the issues that are going on elsewhere, with real restrictive government regimes and real currency depreciation, you're just not going to appreciate how important bitcoin really is to the future success of money.But if we go through here in the U.S. because of a global recession, it will wake people up to how important this is that you do need to start thinking about safeguarding your assets again, right? The last time this happened in 2008 there wasn't an alternative. Most of the smartest investors in the world were either shorting equities, and we know that was a disaster. Or they were buying gold, which has been a bad trade for 10 years, or they were shorting sovereign bonds. You know, anything from Italy to Spain to Greece. And that was a disaster because the ECB bailed everyone out. Bitcoin was just getting going. Then it wasn't the viable option it is now. And if you do have a shake-up like that, like I said, near term it's going to be bad for bitcoin. Long term, it will certainly make many more investors and many more people aware that bitcoin is a solution to these problems.BK: Jeff, that is fascinating. And I really appreciate your time and your joining us todayJD: Absolutely. Fun to be here.

Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Oct 25, 2019 at 19:55 UTC","Ethereum’s next system-wide upgrade, Istanbul, is scheduled to arrive on mainnet the week of Dec. 4.","The decision was made during an ethereum core developer call on Oct. 25. Later on Friday, Danno Ferrin, blockchain protocol engineer at ethereum venture studio ConsenSys, proposed activating Istanbul at block number 9,056,000 in accordance with the targeted date of Dec. 4.“From when I calculated … at 14-second block times its 245,544.5 blocks, which puts noon UTC at block 9,055,928.5. So I would propose 9,056,000 as the Istanbul mainnet block target. Please check my math,” Ferrin wrote after the meeting in an ethereum core developers chat room.Update (Oct. 30, 13:09 UTC):@CoinDesk can you please add an addendum to your article stating the 9,056,000 was a preliminary proposal and 9,069,000 is the actual block number?— Danno ""Please check my math"" Ferrin (@shemnon) October 29, 2019During the call, devs also agreed that in the case of any unexpected issues with the upgrade software between now and the week of Dec. 4, Istanbul’s mainnet activation would be delayed one month to Jan. 8.“The thing about the [Jan.8] backstop date is that if we’re going to ship and change the time, we have to build a new client … and get everyone to install the client,” Ferrin said during the call. “At least four weeks for a re-spin is necessary.”During the last system-wide upgrade, Constantinople, ethereum developers did indeed need to delay mainnet activation of the upgrade for a month due to a critical code vulnerability discovered just 48 hours before Constantinople’s scheduled roll-out.This time, ethereum core developers are covering all their bases with pre-determined backstop dates in the event of any unforeseen circumstances.Said Ethereum Foundation developer Piper Merriam:“There’s nothing here that says [we can’t launch] the first week of December. We’re just setting some easy backstop dates now and we can always change our mind later if needed.”Come December, Istanbul is expected to introduce six backwards-incompatible code changes to the world’s second-largest blockchain network.The most controversial among them, known as Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1884, will increase the computational costs of recalling data about the ethereum blockchain for application developers. At the same time, the increased fees will better safeguard the $18 billion platform from potential denial-of-service, or spam, attacks.The other code changes introduce more pricing adjustments to the ethereum platform, as well as new code operations that application developers can leverage to verify and authenticate blockchain data more quickly.Last month, Istanbul was activated on ethereum test network Ropsten. Due to its premature timing, however, miners on the network initially faced difficulty rolling out the upgrade.To prevent further confusion over which version of ethereum software to run for miners (the users who validate transactions and process new blocks on the network), ethereum core developers approved today a new code change called EIP 2124.Originally proposed in May by ethereum core developers Péter Szilágyi and Felix Lange, EIP 2124 introduces a mechanism for users to easily identify what version of software a computer server, also called a node, in the ethereum network is running.“Generally, clients have a hard time following a non-majority chain so usually you have to tweak the clients [manually] … to make sure they’re on the right chain.” said Szilágyi, adding:“All these issues can be fixed by including the fork ID.”Called the “fork identifier,” Szilágyi explained on the call that EIP 2124 is a “tiny and beyond trivial change.” It can be rolled out by any ethereum software client without the need for coordination with other actors.Outside of this, James Hancock, project lead at ethereum startup ETHSignals who most notably tried to initiate a fork of the ethereum blockchain in June, announced that he was joining the Ethereum Foundation to help coordinate ethereum system-wide upgrades, also called hard forks.“I’m joining the [Ethereum Foundation] to help with hard fork coordination,” said Hancock. “For me, I want to focus on getting EIPs ready rather than focus on when are we going to release [an upgrade]. … It’s about changing the attitude from how many forks are we going to have this year to getting EIPs ready [for a fork].”Ethereum image via CoinDesk archives"

Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Oct 26, 2019 at 08:20 UTC",A crypto executive is suing AT&T over a SIM swapping hack that he claims cost him $1.7 million in digital assets in a hit aimed at three executives attending Consensus 2018,"VideoCoin Head of Strategy Seth Shapiro alleged in his lawsuit, filed Oct. 17  in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, that the cell carrier granted hackers repeated access to his SIM card in May 2018, allowing them to clear out his wallets on 11 exchanges worth over $1.8 million dollars. In the almost cinematic 58-page complaint, Shapiro lays out an elaborate web of inside men, internal conspiracy and back-to-back SIM swaps that have already landed at least two former AT&T employees in criminal court:“By utilizing their control over Mr. Shapiro’s AT&T cell phone number—and the control of additional accounts (such as his email) secured through that number by utilizing two factor authentication—these third-party hackers were able to access Mr. Shapiro’s accounts on various cryptocurrency exchange platforms, including the accounts he controlled on behalf of his business venture. The hackers then transferred Mr. Shapiro’s currency from Mr. Shapiro’s accounts into accounts that they controlled. In all, they stole more than $1.8 million from Mr. Shapiro in the two consecutive SIM swap attacks on May 16, 2018.”The lawsuit alleged that two former AT&T employees from Tucson, Arizona, were the key to the operation. Jarrett White and Robert Jack received $4,300 and $585.25, respectively, from hackers referred to in court documents as “The Community” to feed the six-man group a stream of insider intel. It was this backdoor that gave “The Community” access to Shapiro’s cellphone, the document said.Shapiro said that of the $1.757 million stolen, $1 million was his and the remainder to belong to other people who were investing in crypto projects with him.  In addition to Shapiro, the thieves also swapped the SIMs of two other executives at the event, Chris Kitze and Fiorenzi Villani.Although not mentioned in the court filing, all three executives are partners in a series of crypto PR companies and investment funds. In fact, they are all this weekend presenting at a conference produced by the most well-known crypto swapping victim, Michael Terpin, who is also suing AT&T for a SIM heist that cost him $23.8 million, in addition to seeking $200 million in punitive damages.Shapiro, Kitze and Terpin are members of Pro Top Company Services, in Tortola, British Virgin Islands, advertising crypto investment funds. This nine-member company mirrors a second BVI-registered organization, Alphabit Fund, with only seven members, which excludes Shapiro and another executive, their business development representative in Japan. Villani is a partner with Terpin in the Transform GROUP public relations company, and both are organizers of the CoinAgenda conference this weekend in Las Vegas. All four presented at the event last year, though Shapiro was not included in this year’s list of featured speakers.Kitze, a serial entrepreneur with several notable dot-com era exits, was registered at the 2018 Consensus event as an executive at a blockchain company that no longer seems to be in operation.On the day of the theft, Shapiro’s VideoCoin announced the completion of a $50 million initial coin offering (ICO) entirely through private investment, rather than the typical public sale. Investors included Galaxy Investment Partners, ethereum co-founder Anthony Di Iorio, Akamai Co-Founder Randall Kaplan, Science Blockchain and Alphabit Fund.In his account to investigators, Shapiro said he was targeted on May 16, 2018, while attending CoinDesk’s annual Consensus conference in New York. Shapiro said he lost cell reception and went to a Manhattan AT&T store for help, testimony collected by investigators show. AT&T salespersons confirmed his suspicions: he had been the victim of a SIM-swapping hack, the same kind of attack that has allowed hackers to steal from other high profile figures. Shapiro purchased a new phone and SIM card at the AT&T salesperson’s recommendation. He was already fearful, according to the civil complaint, that the hackers would get into his crypto accounts. He thought the new phone would stave off the heist.But “The Community” and their moles inside AT&T were one step ahead of him, a chat stream collected by investigators show:“57 COINS. In bittrex. Trying to stay calm. Rn.” said @ilvebtc in a series of successive texts to The Community group chat, titled “hehe,” on May 16 at around 2:00pm in the afternoon. @ilvebtc had breached Shapiro’s Bittrex account. @coinmission responded: “He probably has way more in other places. He has eth.”A wallet address mentioned in the chat shows over 1,200 ETH, worth about $500,000 at the time routed into the wallet from a Bittrex account. Three equal cuts of 441.6 ETH later flowed outbound. Later in the exchange, @woahk, who is referred to by other members as “Joel,” notes that some unusual activity is happening on the SIM-swapped phone. “He’s trying to get number back. I’m getting text messages.”Joel Ortiz was sentenced in April to 10 years in prison for prolific SIM swapping, becoming the first person in the country to be jailed for such an offense. He had made off with an estimated $7.5 million across 40 hacks; Ortiz’s sentencing documents show that at least $900,000 of that came from Seth Shapiro.AT&T told CoinDesk in a statement that it is refuting Shapiro’s allegations and plans to fight them in court.SIM card image via Shutterstock"

Polish authorities claim that Molina Lee is wanted in Poland for laundering up to 1.5 billion zloty or about $390 million “from illegal sources,” according to the Polish report.Authorities wrote that Molina Lee’s crimes included “laundering dirty money for Columbian drug cartels using a cryptocurrency exchange.”Polish prosecutors claim that Crypto Capital held accounts in Bank Spółdzielczy in the town of Skierniewice and that Molina Lee and Bitfinex laundered illegal proceeds through the country.The company has been in trouble before. Molina Lee is directly connected with a U.S. Department of Justice claim that charged two individuals with running a “shadow banking” service that provided bank accounts for crypto companies. His company, Crypto Capital, allegedly lost $880 million of Bitfinex’s cash, leading to a $1 billion token sale this year.“This the largest effort by Polish prosecutors to secure losses associated with illegal activity,” wrote Polish prosecutors, adding:“The effort was a combined effort between Polisha and international special forces. The proceedings were conducted by prosecutors from the Lower Silesian Branch of the Department for Organized Crime and Corruption of the National Prosecutor’s Office in Wrocław and officers who closely cooperated with Europol, Interpol and US services, including the DEA.”Laundry image via Shutterstock"

supply of ether will continue to grow over time. Currently, inflation on ...","Oct 25, 2019 at 08:00 UTC",The Takeaway:,"As ethereum undergoes a major upgrade in 2020, how might the economics of the second-largest blockchain begin to shift? The next major iteration of ethereum, dubbed Ethereum 2.0, will be based on a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus protocol. This means that transactions on the blockchain will be processed and validated by users who stake wealth as opposed to miners who expend energy.People who stake on ethereum’s PoS network – known as validators – are rewarded by earning annualized interest on their locked-in ether. At present, the minimum amount of ether required to become a validator is 32 ETH, which is equivalent to roughly $5,200.Collin Myers, head of global product strategy at ConsenSys, the Brooklyn-based ethereum venture studio, said validators with 32 ETH can expect to earn between 4.6 and 10.3 percent in annualized returns at the launch of the Ethereum 2.0 network. Myers announced during the recent ethereum developer conference Devcon that he was building a user application enabling validators to calculate annual gross and net returns given varying costs of hardware and electricity.“The ETH 2.0 Calculator [is being] developed for protocol researchers, validators and enthusiasts to increase transparency and education of the Ethereum 2.0 network economics,” Myers said in a Devcon presentation. He plans to launch the web tool in conjunction with the launch of Ethereum 2.0, which is tentatively planned for the first quarter of 2020. Of course, current figures on validator rewards for Ethereum 2.0 are by no means set in stone, as the community is still debating the design parameters of the upgrade.Kristy-Leigh Minehan, former CTO of blockchain and AI startup Core Scientific, who proposed the contentious ethereum mining algorithm change “ProgPoW,” said:“These are proposed suggestions by ethereum research but until we actually roll over to Ethereum 2.0, none of us will know for sure. They’re constantly tweaking it right now. It can be pretty fluid.”Myers said community input on the design of Ethereum 2.0 was imperative.“This is a topic that we will continue to jam on. It’s not completed or ended yet,” he said. “There’s been new things proposed by Vitalik [Buterin] that would [change things] if accepted by the community.” One of the most recent proposals by ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin suggests a sharp reduction in the number of mini-blockchains, or shards, in the initial phases of Ethereum 2.0 deployment. Instead of launching the full network with 1,024 shards, Buterin proposes launching just 64, thereby improving cross-shard communication on the network. This proposal has been well-received by researchers and protocol developers, who say lowering the number of shards will reduce the network’s complexity. But a reduction in shard count means a lower number of validators and total stake needed to secure the Ethereum 2.0 network. “By lowering the shard count, essentially you need to make some other trade-off,” said Myers, adding: “You’re going to have to increase the power of the independent [validators] running on the network. It’s a higher grade of hardware. It’s going to be a bit more expensive for me to participate as a validator.”With these caveats, Myers highlighted three important details about Ethereum 2.0’s economic model that he doesn’t see changing any time soon. According to Myers’ calculations, validators on Ethereum 2.0 who stake 32 ETH have the potential to earn 10.4 percent in annual interest given the assumption the network launches with 2 million ETH staked. This 10.4 percent target return for validators is unlikely to change even with only one-sixteenth of the shards originally envisioned for the network. However, “net issuance” (Myers’s term), which takes account of hardware costs, will likely have to be updated. At launch, validators can expect to receive 5.60 percent of their stake in rewards. If they require a higher grade of hardware to run Ethereum 2.0 software, and there are only 64 shards, returns are likely to fall in value.  “Some say [net returns] will decrease by 20 percent but those numbers aren’t exact and I haven’t made my opinion on that yet,” Myers said.  Validators on a proof-of-stake blockchain like Ethereum 2.0 have a similar responsibility to that of miners on a proof-of-work blockchain. These actors on a blockchain serve to process transactions and append new blocks.  The new model changes the emphasis from computation to control. PoW networks have external costs, such as computational power. Ensuring the honesty of actors on a PoS network are internal mechanisms such as staked value. The more ETH people stake on Ethereum 2.0, the greater its level of security. The fewer shards there are in Ethereum 2.0, the fewer validators it needs to secure the overall network. Jack O’Holleran, CEO and founder of ethereum scalability startup Skale Labs, said of this dynamic rewards model:“On a high level, Ethereum 2.0 is trying to solve the elasticity, as well as, supply and demand, issues of ETH. One real innovative and impactful thing [about Ethereum 2.0] is its dynamic pricing.”Following the launch of Ethereum 2.0, a greater number of validators will be needed to secure the Ethereum 2.0 network and ensure the honesty of all actors. This is because the first stage of deployment, called Phase Zero, only introduces one PoS blockchain: the “beacon chain.” In a subsequent deployment stage, Phase 1, developers plan to launch 1,024 (or 64) other PoS blockchains, known as shards. To secure all these additional PoS networks, Myers said a higher number of validators, and staked wealth, will be needed in the system.As the overall staked wealth of the Ethereum 2.0 ecosystem grows, the lower the annualized reward becomes for each individual validator. The dynamic rewards scheme for Ethereum 2.0 ensures that the network is never over- or under-paying for its security.Fredrik Harrysson, CTO of ethereum software client Parity, told CoinDesk in April:“There’s a sliding scale of rewards that depends on how much ETH is locked up in stake. In a system where you have very small amounts of stake locked up, you want to encourage more people to stake and lock up more ETH to increase the security of the chain.”The aim in Phase 1, according to Myers, will be to reduce reward issuance on 32 ETH for each validator to roughly 7.2 percent in interest and 2.39 percent in net profit. This is comparable to other staking networks, such as Dash and Tezos, which return upwards of 5 percent interest annually. Annualized rewards for validators on Ethereum 2.0 depend on the overall amount of wealth staked as well as the total percentage of validators online actively processing transactions. Should only 70 percent of validators be online at a given point in time on the Ethereum 2.0 network, interest rates drop from Myers’s estimate of 7.2 percent to 5.81 percent, at least according to his calculations assuming 1,024 shards. “[Ethereum 2.0] is a collective rewards scheme. The more people online, the more everyone earns. The less online, the less that people are earning,” Myers said, adding:“This is one of the design parameters of Ethereum 2.0 that is quite innovative and genius on the human level. It encourages getting people who don’t know each other to collectively come together and do something.”Even in the ideal scenario of all validators staking 32 ETH in a 1,024-shard universe, the overall network issuance of ether is designed to never exceed 1 percent supply growth annually. This is meant to guard against inflation, and devaluation of purchasing power for the coin over time. That said, controlling ether supply growth on the current ethereum mainnet has been a persistent source of contention for the ethereum community since launch in 2015. Unlike bitcoin, with a hard supply cap of 21 million bitcoins, ethereum’s supply of ether will continue to grow over time. Currently, inflation on ethereum is approximately 4.5 percent, according to ethereum information site ETHHub. Ethereum inflation rates have been as high as 18 percent, but have fallen significantly recently thanks to a series of system-wide upgrades, called hard forks, where developers reduced block rewards issuance in three increments from 5 ETH/block at launch to 2 ETH/block now. The latest reduction from 3 ETH to 2 ETH was a compromise among ethereum stakeholders who presented conflicting proposals for reducing block rewards. In Ethereum 2.0, new monetary policies are designed to ensure a consistent level of inflation below 1 percent and therefore a steady ETH in the long-run. Of course, all these metrics are subject to revision as developers execute hard forks. “In the early days of this system, we’re going to hard-fork a bunch. This is healthy because it means we’re squashing old ideas and innovating new ideas,” Myers said, adding:“The more we hard fork, the healthier it means we are.” Devcon 5 photo by Leigh Cuen for CoinDesk"

In August, Square Crypto hired bitcoin developer Matt Corallo followed by three other dev hires in September from Facebook, Lightning Labs, and Google.At the New York event, Dorsey also responded to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s testimony before the U.S. House Financial Service Committee on Wednesday, according to tweets from The Hollywood Reporter journalist Alex Weprin.“A lot of it seemed to be based in American tradition,” Dorsey said. “I fear that if we base too much in this one concept, we take away the ability to experiment and expand.”Dorsey added:“We are not just serving an American audience, we are serving a global audience … The internet is somewhat of an emerging nation-state.”In his hearing, Zuckerberg notably said Facebook would be compelled to leave the Libra Association if the project went live before meeting regulatory requirements. The Libra Association is still seeking some 80 additional members before the expected mid-to-late 2020 launch, according to a Libra representative speaking with CoinDesk earlier this month.Jack Dorsey image via CoinDesk archives"
