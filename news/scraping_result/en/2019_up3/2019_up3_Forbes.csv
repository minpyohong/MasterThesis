The world’s most prominent digital currency reached as much as $10,332.41 around 9:45 EDT, CoinDesk figures show. At this point, the cryptocurrency was up 39.8% from the intra-day low of $7,393.26 it fell to earlier in the day, additional CoinDesk data reveals. [Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.]Much of the day’s gains took place within short periods of time, as bitcoin rose sharply during a few hours between the late morning and early afternoon, and then enjoyed another strong rally that started after 8 p.m. EDT. The digital currency rose to more than $8,700 as a result of the first upward movement, and extended these gains to surpass $10,000 later at night. This bullish activity took place after bitcoin suffered some notable losses earlier this week, dropping to its lowest since May. The cryptocurrency’s price declined shortly before Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg provided Congressional testimony regarding Libra, a proposed digital currency project. More recently, technical analysts emphasized that the digital currency was approaching a bearish formation called a Death Cross, which would provide a signal of further losses as a result of a 50-day moving average (DMA) dropping below a 200-day moving average. However, markets received a boost earlier today, when Xi Jinping, president of the People’s Republic of China, emphasized the significant opportunity presented by blockchain technology. Bitcoin’s upward movement forced speculators to close out short positions, triggering further upside. The cryptocurrency’s continued rise helped trigger FOMO (fear of missing out), noted analysts, which fueled additional gains. John Todaro, director of digital currency research for TradeBlock, commented on these developments. “Leading up to Mark Zuckerberg's Libra hearing, bitcoin had sold-off as many traders put on bearish positions,” said Todaro. “The technical set up looked negative, but then President Xi Jinping's commentary around blockchain technology was an unexpected positive catalyst that caught some bearish traders off guard in my view, leading to the upward movement which likely brought in more speculators as BTC traded above key thresholds,” he added. Marouane Garcon, managing director of crypto-to-crypto derivatives platform Amulet, also weighed in, emphasizing the key importance of the comments involving China. “There were quite a lot of liquidations but I think it’s still mostly about President Xi’s announcement because people know that his green light will cause a ripple effect across China,” he stated. “The space needs China’s involvement,” added Garcon. “If China would’ve never banned crypto trading and exchanges the space would be a lot bigger today,” he said. “Having China onboard, in my opinion, is just as good if not better than having America onboard.”Forbes Offer: Stay informed and ahead of the crowd with Forbes Crypto Confidential, a free weekly e-letter delivered to your inbox.

Bitcoin's wild swings this week have revitalized trader and investor hopes that bitcoin could be ... [+] back on course to top its all-time highs. Earlier this week, widely-respected bitcoin analyst PlanB, who created the so-called stock-to-flow bitcoin pricing model, reiterated his expectation that bitcoin will hit $100,000 before Christmas 2021. ""Somewhere between and year and a year-and-a-half after the [May 2020] halving, so say before Christmas 2021, bitcoin should be, or should have been above $100,000,"" PlanB told Global Macro Investor founder Raoul Pal. ""If that’s not the case, then all bets are off and [the model] probably breaks down. I don’t expect that to happen.""The stock-to-flow pricing model calculates a ratio based on the existing supply of an asset against how much is entering circulation. Commodities such as gold–with the largest stock-to-flow ratio of 62, meaning it would take 62 years of gold production to get the current gold stock–have a higher stock-to-flow ratio and are valued by investors for their scarcity. Silver has the second-largest stock-to-flow ratio with 22 years for its production to reach the current silver stock. Bitcoin currently has a stock-to-flow ratio of 25 though the model sees this increasing to 50 following the scheduled 2020 bitcoin halving.In May next year, unless the bitcoin network computing power radically changes, the coin reward for mining new bitcoin blocks will drop from 12.5 bitcoin to 6.25 bitcoin–cutting the supply of new bitcoin coming onto the market by half. Earlier this year, Morgan Creek Digital co-founder Anthony Pompliano similar predicted bitcoin will hit $100,000 by the end of 2021, pointing to looser monetary policy from the world's central banks and bitcoin's next halving as a ""perfect storm""–though not everyone agrees. The bitcoin price stagged something of a recovery this week but remains far from its year-to-date ... [+] highs of almost $14,000 per bitcoin set in late June. Following bitcoin's spike yesterday, those in the bitcoin and crypto industry were quick to jump on recent developments as an explanation for bitcoin's uptick. ""I do think Mark Zuckerberg’s testimony got a lot of people worried of a bigger retaliation from regulators, but after most of the questioning had nothing to do with cryptocurrency or libra and with reports of China premier Xi describing blockchain as a 'rule of law network'–spirits have risen and the bull is back,"" said Alex Mashinsky, chief executive of New York-based crypto lending platform Celsius Network.China's president President Xi Jinping said on Thursday that the country should ""seize the opportunity"" of bitcoin's blockchain technology, taken by some that China could ease its strict bitcoin and crypto restrictions.Ahead of Xi's comments, Facebook's chief executive Mark Zuckerberg was savaged by U.S. senators over his plans for a bitcoin rival, dubbed libra, leaving crypto investors with fresh fears there could be a global crackdown on bitcoin and other digital tokens."

""Sentiment in the crypto market is very low right now,"" eToro senior market analyst Mati Greenspan wrote in a note to clients before the pump earlier today. This sentiment slump meant investors bet against the bitcoin price, predicting it would move lower.When the bitcoin price recovered a couple of hundred dollars per bitcoin in just a few minutes, some $150 million worth of short positions on the Seychelles-based BitMEX crypto exchange were liquidated, according to bitcoin and cryptocurrency analytics provider Skew.This triggered what's known as a ""short squeeze,"" where an asset rapidly increases in value due to short sellers trying to cover their positions, resulting in buying volume that drives the price up.""Sentiment can change pretty quickly in this market, especially while volumes are low,"" Greenspan added in his earlier note. A small uptick in the bitcoin price led to millions of dollars of bitcoin short positions being ... [+] liquidated. Bitcoin volumes have been struggling recently, leaving the market especially vulnerable to so-called whales placing large orders or liquidating short positions. Bitcoin trading volume among the top ten biggest bitcoin and crypto exchanges has fallen to under $200 million a day, according to bitcoin and crypto data company Messari, down 20-fold from a peak of $4 billion per day just a few months ago.Adding to the market turnaround, bitcoin futures exchange Bakkt recorded a new all-time high in daily trading volume with 1156 futures contracts traded today. It was Bakkt's lacklustre volumes that many believe triggered bitcoin's fall from its $10,000 plateau late last month."

Bitcoin prices began climbing after he provided these remarks, and but intensified their ascent as market factors drove the digital currency higher. The cryptocurrency enjoyed these gains after a period where many investors had been watching the markets for the possibility of a Death Cross, a bearish formation that takes place when the 50-day moving average falls below the 200-day moving average. Fortunately, this Death Cross did not materialize, according to a BitBull Capital analysis of Bitstamp data. “China’s endorsement of blockchain technology helped Bitcoin recover, and along the way, a short squeeze helped push prices even higher,” said Joe DiPasquale, BitBull Capital’s CEO. “The death cross has, for now, been averted, since the 50-day and 200-day moving averages have not yet crossed,” he stated. “That being said, Bitcoin still needs to cross $9,000 to get out of the danger zone,” added DiPasquale, emphasizing that while the digital currency has “recovered,” it “remains under the major resistance zone between $8,700 and $9,000.” Unless bitcoin can break through this area of resistance, the cryptocurrency will “likely” “fall back,” he stated.

While many questions at the hearing went predictably to Facebook’s ad revenue process, censorship practices on posts, its reputation on data and impacts of foreign adversaries using the platform to influence the 2016 Presidential election, a nuanced policy result entered into the debate. ","INDIA - 2019/10/09: In this photo illustration a popular cryptocurrency Bitcoin logo seen displayed ... [+] on a smartphone. (Photo Illustration by Avishek Das/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)A bill titled “Stablecoins Are Securities Act of 2019”, discussed how managed stablecoins should be treated as securities under the SEC. It was over five years ago when U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) called on U.S. regulators to ban bitcoin. In the July hearing, Congressman Warren Davidson (R-OH) created a great deal of excitement in the cryptocurrency space when he stated, “There’s Bitcoin and Then There’s Shitcoin (Libra).” Indeed, Congress has come a long way in being able to decipher between different blockchains, including a much more decentralized Bitcoin blockchain model operating since 2009, against what starts out as a more centralized approach with Libra. The Ranking Member of the House Financial Services Committee, Patrick McHenry (R-NC), noted on a recent podcast with Laura Shin called “Unconfirmed” that “Bitcoin will be of enormous value”. It is clear that while Congress was originally very explicit to the point that many who discussed policy on the subject of cryptocurrency with Congress would avoid using bitcoin and go through great pains to separate bitcoin the cryptocurrency from blockchain the technology. Indeed, the fluctuations in prices for cryptocurrencies painted a picture similar to the “Wild West” that caused a great deal of unease as the public started to profit in 2017 with a boom in prices, followed by a bust that left many disgruntled. As companies continued to see potential value in these new types of digital coins, soon the idea of finding a way to create stability by backing them with FIAT currencies on a 1-to-1 basis became extremely popular. Companies in the industry space such as Tether queued the banks to look at this stable phenomenon, as JPMorgan Coin was introduced. Soon, it’s very likely Facebook got the memo and realized the creation of a cryptocurrency was a worthwhile endeavor for enabling global payments on a mass scale if the price could remain “stable”. In a response similar to the idea of simply banning Bitcoin in 2014, many in Congress see Libra as an impending threat to the U.S. dollar and that, while Bitcoin likely cannot be banned in the U.S. as has recently been mentioned, perhaps Libra could be stopped through legislation. Indeed, the worst case outcome for any of the cryptocurrencies established on blockchains would be to receive the treatment as a security. This is the death knell for most companies as needing broker-dealers to facilitate transactions on digital tokens that are not truly “equities” means business cannot exist or scale in any meaningful way. So, for a bill that is described as “Stablecoins Are Securities Act of 2019”, the problem of course is how broad of a definition this implies. As the bill refers to “managed stablecoins”, perhaps the “basket of currencies” that Libra was originally thinking of to create stability might shift to different iterations backed directly by a FIAT currency, to avoid the “security” label. Of course, this still indicates that, from a policy perspective, while no bill has been introduced to ban Bitcoin, no one ever expected the introduction of Libra would result in additional scrutiny for cryptocurrencies providing stability in value. Thus, while bitcoin’s virtues of decentralization are being extolled in comparison to other cryptocurrencies, it seems that the bigger threat to the status quo is not decentralization through blockchain technology, but rather the mass distribution of digital carbon copies of tokens that provide a derivative of a fiat currency. For more details on the “Stablecoins Are Securities Act of 2019”, see the draft bill below: "

The rally has spread across the entire cryptocurrency market, with 60 out of the top 100 cryptocurrencies advancing.What can explain this change in the game for major cryptocurrencies? “Halving, according to Daniel Haudenschild, CEO of SIBEX. ""We are coming into a time where the Bitcoin price is being affected by halving, with Bitcoin’s inflation rate recently dropping from 3.8% to 1.8%,” he says. “Prices typically increase significantly leading up to the halving and have been followed both times by a 10x move just a few weeks later. The 2016 halving started a rally that brought BTC prices from $600 to $19,000 just one month after the halving.”koyfin_20191026_085932654That’s why all eyes should be on Bitcoin for clues into the future. “The BTC price is still the major factor in alt coin prices,” he adds. “Recent downward corrections are symptoms of large block movements in a market with no functioning OTC infrastructure. However, these are minor compared with the rally normally associated with a halving.""koyfin_20191026_080403436Meanwhile, there’s the abundance of liquidity, which fuels speculation in all risky assets. NASDAQ shares, for instance, has been rallying to new highs in recent weeks.koyfin_20191026_081049594And there are seasonal factors, which create a bullish sentiment for risky assets.Still, technical analyst, Nicholas Pelecanos, Advisor to NEM Ventures, sees the digital currency to be range bound for the rest of the year. ""Bitcoin has broken to new lows that we have not seen since June. Currently we are seeing a fairly clear bullish divergence in the BTC price, but I would not be surprised if the recent lows are retested in the short to medium term. After the 50% fall in price from the highs set earlier this year, I’m largely expecting the BTC price to range until the end of the year.”While this pattern could scare away investors, it could be good for traders. “This does not mean that trading opportunities won’t be abundant, as a BTC range can be greater than 30% from the support to the resistance and generally a flat BTC allows for more capital to flow into ALTs.""Provided, of course, that these traders can time the market."

It has lost seven of its largest partners in less than a month: PayPal, Visa, Mastercard, Stripe, Mercado Pago, Booking Holdings and eBay. 21 members of the group still remain, including Uber, Spotify and Vodafone. And although Zuckerberg has pledged to cooperate with regulators, there is still red tape to negotiate and politicians to appease before libra can be launched.Zuckerberg appeared before the committee ostensibly to provide an update and more clarity on plans for Facebook’s libra cryptocurrency, but he never clearly explained how Facebook is expecting to profit from libra, and, if the project isn’t about money, why it’s taking on such a complex project at all.Not everyone was convinced by Zuckerberg’s testimony: Congressman Brad Sherman of California dismissed cryptocurrency as technology that is only useful for criminals, and warned that these new types of assets have the potential to threaten the U.S. dollar’s dominance over the global financial system. And committee chairwoman Maxine Waters didn’t hide her contempt in her opening statement:“It would be beneficial for all if Facebook concentrates on addressing its many existing deficiencies and failures before proceeding any further on the libra project,” she said.Wtih libra in the spotlight, bitcoin sank to a five-month low on Wednesday. Prices fell to $7,307.39, their lowest level since May 18.  At this point, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market value had lost nearly half of its value since reaching nearly $14,000 in June. Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer of asset manager Arca, said that “increased regulatory scrutiny” drove the sale of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in the hours leading up to the hearing.But bitcoin regained those losses and much more with a meteoric rise Friday. It rallied nearly 40% in a 24-hour span, briefly exceeding $10,000 late Friday night for the first time in more than a month before settling back to a little more than $9,000.Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse weighed in on the issue, telling FOX Business on Wednesday that Facebook “deficit of trust” has hurt the libra project. Garlinghouse also chastised Zuckerberg for telling Congress libra is a way to extend America’s financial leadership: “Last I checked it is based in Switzerland.”Ripple announced on Tuesday that it is opening an office in Washington D.C., which according to company officials makes it the first and only cryptocurrency and blockchain company in the industry with an office devoted to government and regulatory affairs.Plus: Ripple’s XRP has added some 30% to its price since the end of September.In other news, this week also brought the announcement that a coalition of major accounting firms are teaming up with ConsenSys, Microsoft, and others to create a risk assessment tool that provides accountants, auditors, CFOs, and compliance leads with guidance to evaluate digital assets and blockchain technology. HTC now has an entry-level blockchain phone [The Verge]Casa Is Helping Bitcoin Investors Pass on Their Holdings When They Die [CoinDesk]Binance to Launch Venus Cryptocurrency [Bloomberg]"

","On September 30, 2019, a company called Block.one paid a $24 million fine for an unregistered securities offering as part of a settlement with the SEC. Block.one publishes EOSIO and EOS is one of many blockchains built on EOSIO. EOS was created by the developer community. Block.one doesn’t own, manage, or monitor the EOS Public Blockchain. The settlement relates specifically to the ERC-20 token sold on the Ethereum blockchain between June 26, 2017 and June 1, 2018, which is no longer in circulation or traded, and will not require the token to be registered as a security with the SEC nor will there be ongoing reporting requirements. The settlement relates specifically to the ERC-20 token sold on the Ethereum blockchain between June 26, 2017 and June 1, 2018, which is no longer in circulation or trade and will not require the token to be registered as a security with the SEC. On October 10, 2019, the CFTC’s new Chairman Heath Talbert announced Ethereum is a commodity. Ethereum is the second largest blockchain by market cap, with EOS in the top ten. Color macro shotWhat is also interesting is Block.one’s opening of an office in Arlington, Virginia, right next to Washington D.C., with numerous politicians including the Virginia Governor at the opening, indicating the potential of up to 200 blockchain jobs. As I reported earlier this week, Ripple just opened up a major political and regulatory affairs office in D.C. as well. These moves indicate an increased effort by the industry in working the SEC and CFTC. One theory in regulatory relations that goes back quite a while, is the concept of a race to the bottom. Regulators - or countries - attempt to lower the threshold on regulations to attract businesses to its jurisdiction. For example, the Libra Association established itself in Switzerland rather than the United States, perhaps as a result of the Swiss law for nonprofits that makes it easier and less likely to face stringent regulation. In fact, many in Congress asked Libra why not or to please consider re-establishing itself in the U.S. For U.S. regulators, a race to the bottom will occur when an agency may lower its standards in some ways to attract more businesses to be under its purview. While this may seem counterintuitive, the many regulators in the U.S. do have a healthy sense of competition between each other and can equal measures of power and influence in D.C. Indeed, regulators facing a lower amount of entities to regulate translates to budget and job cuts for the regulators of that agency. Customers line up in front of an IndyMac Bank branch in Santa Monica, California, on July 14, 2008. ... [+] Federally-seized IndyMac Bank was due to reopen Monday after suffering one of the biggest bank closures in US history, as the troubled US mortgage industry struggles to stem further meltdown.The regulatory Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) announced Friday it had placed the California-based bank, worth an estimated 32 billion dollars, under the control of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). The mortgage lender, which will reopen as IndyMac Federal Bank, marked the largest bank failure in a year of mortgage and foreclosure crisis highlighted by a surge in defaults and a plunge in housing prices which are rippling through the US economy. AFP PHOTO GABRIEL BOUYS (Photo credit should read GABRIEL BOUYS/AFP via Getty Images)The Global Financial Crisis showed a textbook example of the worst kind of impact from a “race to the bottom”. The Office of Thrift Supervision served as the regulator of Countrywide, IndyMac, Washington Mutual, and AIG - all headline-grabbing bank failures. When a bank fails that is of a significant amount, there is a statutory “Material Loss Review” (MLR) investigation of the regulator and the facts and circumstances of the bank failure. In the case of IndyMac bank, one of the most egregious examples of a regulator placating a bank it was responsible for examining was noted in the MLR below: “...OTS allowed IndyMac to record an $18 million capital infusion from the holding company, received in May 2008, as though it was available on March 31, 2008. This allowed IndyMac to inappropriately report that it was at the well capitalized level as of March 31.” A race to the bottom can lead to the regulator taking the side of the industry it regulates. This is another concept known as regulatory capture, a symptom of this race to the bottom. For cryptocurrency companies, the idea of regulators lowering their standards is probably a breath of fresh air. Indeed, the many regulators in the U.S. economy can make for a costly and confusing dilemma for these companies. With some of the rhetoric in Congress lately on cryptocurrency and blockchain, the idea of a race to the bottom for this industry is actually a much-needed solution to the potential stifling of this innovation that sends U.S. companies overseas. As regulators embrace cryptocurrency and blockchain innovations, the true test will be in the actual, ongoing work of regulating these companies once better clarity is established and the dust settles. Congress and the public relies upon the regulators - and the inherent trust placed in them - to ensure that, as leeway may be offered providing at times “light-touch” regulation, that these do not mean either ignoring the failings of a company to comply with regulators, or in the very worst case with IndyMac bank, being complicit in falsifying regulatory reports on the status of a particular company’s financials. Correction: On Monday, October 28, this article was clarified to reflect that the settlement applies solely to the ERC-20 token raise, where the token is no longer a security and that Block.one is the publisher of EOSIO, a platform for several blockchains to be built upon, including the EOS public blockchain that has EOS as a native cryptocurrency.

The goal of ICOs was not necessarily to sell shares. Rather, they were created to issue tokens with no need for stock exchanges or intermediaries like banks.","ICOs' hype started with Ethereum token sales (which is now the No. 2 crypto by market cap). According to ICObench statistics, at least 5,156 ICOs have been created since 2014, with a total $26.17 billion funds raised. But the party didn't last so long. When bitcoin's price started to slide in 2018, the same happened to funds raised by ICOs. In the first quarter of that year, ICOs raised $3.9 billion. However, in Q2, that number slid slightly to $3.8 billion. Q3 saw $1.7 billion in sales, and Q4 saw $0.8 billion.Many crypto investors have lost interest in ICOs, and new token sale formats have been created, namely security token offerings (STOs) and initial exchange offerings (IEOs). But how do these three formats stack up against each other?ICOsIn a classic ICO, a startup issues its tokens and sells them in exchange for other tokens (like bitcoin or Ethereum) through its website. Today, the largest ICO is the EOS project, which raised more than $4.2 billion at the end of its token sales in June 2018.On the darker side of things, in my experience, the ICO format could allow token issuers to completely avoid responsibility for fulfilling obligations. This attracts swindlers and casts a shadow even on bona fide projects. This factor became the main reason for the transition to new models where the risks for investors are reduced.STOsAn STO is the regulated issuance and distribution of tokens that perform the functions of securities (stocks, bonds or derivatives). During this process, I've noticed that bureaucratic procedures slow down and complicate the process, significantly increasing the entry threshold for investors. In addition, STOs significantly limit their number of participants.The STO boom expected in the second half of 2018 or first half of 2019 did not happen. According to PwC Strategy report released in June, the biggest STO of the year of that time was BoltonCoin, which raised $68 million. In comparison, the biggest IEO -- launched by Bitfinex -- raised a whopping $1 billion. So, most investors chose the classic ICO model or went for the IEO, like Bitfinex did.IEOsAn IEO is the newest and most popular token sale format, from what I've seen in the industry. It's often seen as the most balanced option, since it comes with minimum bureaucratic procedures and simultaneously guarantees a certain investment reliability degree.The first IEOs have been held on Binance Launchpad since December 2017, but this format really gained popularity in January 2019 with the BitTorrent token sale, which caused widespread discussion and sparked new hype.According to an InWara report, in the first half of 2019, 59 IEOs were created, and their total funds raised totaled $1.625 billion.Pros And ConsSo, what makes an IEO so attractive for cryptocurrency investors?IEO AdvantagesIEO DisadvantagesInvestors In the IEO eraNowadays, token sales give private investors the opportunity to contribute their money and savings to promising startups without any regulations. This leaves out the need to pay extra money to intermediaries, like in pre-IPO or IPO deals.After “cryptowinter,” the token sale market has considerably matured and stabilized. Still, investors in this market haven't changed. The majority of them, in my experience, are short-term speculators seeking to make three, five or even 10 times returns within one year. That was theoretically possible in the past, but it’s hardly likely now.New crypto investors should study prospective projects before investing in them. It is worth studying some historically successful projects and highlighting their key success factors. Look for these factors in new projects, especially IEOs.ICO, IEO, and other similar models are investments in startups, most often in their very early stages. This is always a big risk. Venture investors have a rule: Out of 10 selected projects, three will completely fail, three will go into the reeds, three will not bring significant profit and only one will find great success.The FutureDespite the booming popularity of IEOs, ICOs and STOs are still relevant. There are still projects that hold token sales on their own -- without relying on exchanges.Above everything else, any token sale is a tool. Any investment instrument carries risks, and these risks are traditionally higher for nonregulated instruments. But, if you can learn to use these instruments competently and diversify your investments, you could achieve great results."

Price Picture · Big Four Accounting Firm Wants To Empower Enterprises ...","Oct 25, 2019,05:56am EDT","Do you know how to invest in the private capital market?  Not many people do.  It is complicated, requires a lot of paperwork, has low transaction volume, comes with risk and volatility, and not very liquid. ","Could distributed ledger technology (DLT) be used to reduce back-office fees and expand the market for this asset class? I interviewed Oscar Jofre, CEO and co-founder of KoreConX, who believes his platform and infrastructure can help.KoreConX is a company working to change how businesses raise capital.  Mr. Jofre is an advocate for using DLT to bring transparency to a fractured process.  Mr. Jofre mentioned, “There are over 90,000 companies in our platform from around the globe who have raised more than $6.6 billion. Companies who use the KoreConX platform raised capital working with broker-dealers or direct offerings on their own. We are purely providing the technology to make sure they are fully compliant and to manage the entire process.”What is the private capital market?  What are the problems?The private capital market represents companies not publicly traded on stock exchanges. Private funds, venture capital investors, and some mutual funds are typically the main buyers.  Investments can be in new start-up enterprises, mature business, or sometimes struggling firms. This type of asset is considered to be highly risky.  One critical problem, the team at KoreConX explained, was the lack of market access for small firms. Dr. Kiran Garimella, KoreConX’s CSO and CTO, said, “The majority of participants in private capital markets are smaller entities who are closely connected with local companies and investors. They cannot afford huge expenses for integrated systems.”  KoreConX specializes in connecting all sizes of firms rather than limiting their scope to more mature enterprises.  Interestingly CEO Oscar Jofre’s background is crowdfunding, which is a driving influence in his business.Jason Futko, CFO and co-founder, said, “It is often difficult for companies in the private capital markets to identify investors to present their opportunity. The fragmentation in this market can make it difficult to find investors or other professionals to help you grow your business.” On June 26th, 2019, Broadridge bought from Northern Trust a similar blockchain platform.  There is competition in this space from many players. Mr. Jofre said, “There are companies like Carta, Capshares, ComputerShare, AST, and Link Group that offer some of the features KoreConX provides in our all-in-one platform. We have a much different view of the market. To truly transform it, we need to make sure all participants have all the tools they need. If they don't, then we will never see any great change in the private capital markets.”KoreConX launched on October 11th, 2019, their new blockchain ecosystem for fully compliant digital securities worldwide.  Their mission is to ensure compliance with securities regulation and corporate law.  The KoreConX platform includes securitized token issuance, trading, clearing, settlement, management, reporting, and corporate actions.As explained to me by the management team, the lack of data integrity and regional knowledge of jurisdictional compliance can restrict investment opportunities offered to the public.  Mr. Futko continued, “Obviously part of the solution under KoreConX has to be around connecting document fragmentation, providing access to professionals and creating trust through our blockchain, which ensures both business and regulatory logic.”Why can blockchain technology help now?The KoreConX team stated that the private capital markets serve over 450 million private companies worldwide today.  They have a lack of document transparency and high fees. Compare this to public capital markets, which have established listing standards and rules.  Furthermore, open markets are used every day and can handle many transactions.  Dr. Garimella said, “Blockchain offers technology that provides solid mechanisms for trust through immutability and consensus among parties.”I asked Mr. Jofre to explain why his work was different from larger companies, like Broadridge? He responded, “KoreConX is entering a market with many providers who have a single feature or application. For private capital markets to be as efficient, as public listed markets, it needs an infrastructure layer and an application layer.  KoreConX brings both.  We do not exclude anyone because of size or geography.”"

[+] ""Open Topps Baseball Series 1 Cards "" event at the Topps' offices on February 10, 2016 in New York City. (Kris Connor/Getty Images)","Once present at every deli, gas station and department store, baseball cards have found a resurgence online. Instagram albums and live YouTube box breaks have replaced baseball cards shops and card shows. Author Eric Moskowitz details navigating a new community of dealers and collectors in his Atlantic article, “How Baseball Cards Got Weird.” “I was born in the late '70s and grew up in what we now think of as a junk wax era when people were totally crazy about baseball cards,” Moskowitz said on the Baseball Happenings Podcast. “You could not go into a 7-Eleven, supermarket or a greeting card store without finding all of the rack packs and wax pack boxes crowded by the register.” “It's easier to find actual major leaguers in my neighborhood than it is finding their cards.” Imagine Moskowitz's surprise when he could not find one pack in his baseball crazed Washington Heights neighborhood. He said you were more likely to run into David Ortiz getting a shape-up than spot a Topps logo at the legion of street corner bodegas. “I live in Washington Heights, which is a baseball epicenter of New York City,” he said. “Around Father's Day, somebody asked us, ‘Does anyone know where I can buy some baseball cards?’ And it was like crickets. Nobody knew. “You used to be able to walk out your door and find cards anywhere—even street vendors on the sidewalk. That's all gone in our neighborhood here. There's a barbershop where like every Dominican player on a visiting team goes when they're here to play the Yankees or the Mets. They get their hair cut at the Jordan MVP barbershop on 189th and Broadway. So, it's easier to find actual major leaguers in my neighborhood than it is finding their cards. I could not have imagined that scenario as a kid.” Now in his early 40s, Moskowitz sampled new baseball cards digitally on his way back into the hobby. He got his feet wet by watching various baseball card dealers known as ""breakers"" who live stream opening their products. Customers buy into slots (teams, players, etc.), and the breakers do the sorting. From the confines of his home, Moskowitz discovered his new baseball card store with Gargoyle Card Breaks. He bonded with their owner Billy Byington and his customers through chat room discussions. “When I found Billy's break at Gargoyle, it was very clear he had a community,"" he said. ""I was very transparent. I told people that I'm here as a collector coming back after 25 years, but I'm also working on a magazine piece about the state of cards. Everybody sort of jumped into the chat saying, ‘Oh man, you're so lucky you found Billy. His prices are fair, he's a great guy and you will see the same people come back every night. And it's not just because we're obsessive addicts, but because they have a great rapport.’” As Moskowitz developed a feel for this new voyeuristic collecting world, he found traditional set cards (also called base cards) became this era's junk wax. Loose packs at local shops, shows, and national retailers were tagged as the hobby’s third rail as consumers searched for a less tainted buying experience. “What I learned that day is the pack has become radioactive,” he said. ""The pack used to be the essential building block of card collecting. You got a pack of cards, originally probably a dozen or 15 [cards] and a stick of gum. “Now even at the low end, you're guaranteed to get one, two or three autographs, a relic or a serial-numbered card in a box. Nobody wants a straight pack. They want a chance of getting a fresh box or case to make sure they're not getting the warmed-over leftovers after somebody found the big hit from a box.” With high-value inserts buried throughout cases across the country, earnest collectors vie to pull one of these rarities. As the stakes have skyrocketed, sports cards have attracted attention from investors such as entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk. Topps captured Vaynerchuk’s hobby involvement in a series of sets earlier this year. Moskowitz spoke with Gary Vee to get his pulse on collecting’s re-emergence. “He thinks short of an economic crash, that this has not yet crossed over into something that is sort of universally cool, or totally mainstream yet,” he said. “It's still coming back, and he thinks the white-hot moment is still a year away.” Moskowitz urges one to use a sense of caution, especially when looking at their cards as an investment. He likens the rise of curious investors dipping their toes into the card market to those who jumped into cryptocurrency a short while ago. “It makes you think a little bit of that Bitcoin moment,” he said. “People who were throwing their money at crypto were maybe people who didn't have it to lose. … I think something like cards [is] obviously volatile, and anyone who is getting into cards as a primary investment is taking a big risk.” His Atlantic piece supplied a fresh outsider perspective, vocalizing someone peering around the hobby's edges looking for a comfortable entry point. Thumbing through his new acquisitions, Moskowitz resonated in his rediscovered enjoyment.“I think that they're fun,” he said. “I had kind of forgotten how much I loved it, and I've gotten totally hooked again. I would be lying if I said I wasn't excited if I got a card that was worth something, but I wouldn't advise it as a retirement plan. On the other hand ... the trends are that as part of this comeback, card values have been going up again.”"
