CoinDesk",https://www.coindesk.com/most-bitcoin-buyers-are-in-the-money-ahead-of-the-halving-data-suggests,"However, the current state of the bitcoin market is warning of a 
post-halving price pullback. The number one cryptocurrency by market value 
is ...","May 8, 2020 at 19:12 UTC","With bitcoin more than doubling in price since “Black Thursday” nearly two months ago, nearly 85% — or 25.79 million — of addresses holding the cryptocurrency are now “in the money,” according to blockchain intelligence firm IntoTheBlock. However, the current state of the bitcoin market is warning of a post-halving price pullback. ","The number one cryptocurrency by market value is trading near $10,000 at press time - up nearly 160% from the low of $3,867 registered on March 12, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price.An address is said to be in the money if the current price of bitcoin is higher than the price at which the coin was purchased or sent to the address. While 85% of the addresses are in the money, 10.8%, or 3.28 million addresses are out of the money or have acquired coins at an average price higher than the current market price. The remaining 4.1% (1.24 million) are at the money, meaning the average price they acquired their bitcoin is around current market levels. Such a structure may not bode well for the cryptocurrency in the near term. With the majority of addresses already in a state of profit, some observers expect selling pressure to emerge over the weekend or following the mining reward halving expected on May 11. “We anticipate a number of investors will take advantage of rising prices ahead and into the halving to realize gains in the short term,"" said Ed Hindi, CIO of Tyr Capital Arbitrage SP, which focuses on liquidity provision and arbitrage within the cryptocurrency markets.See also: Money Reimagined: Picasso Up, Main Street DownMeanwhile, market intelligence firm Glassnode tweeted on Thursday that more than 80% of the current bitcoin supply is profitable and significant increases to BTC's price in anticipation of the halving could trigger some to realize gains in the short term.A post-halving drop looks quite possible because the retail participation has gone up over the past few months. The number of addresses holding at least 0.1 BTC began increasing exponentially from February and recently rose to a record high of 3,014,888, according to Glassnode data. The address growth continued even while bitcoin’s prices slid from $10,000 to the $3,867 seen in the first half of March. Put simply, some investors look to have acquired coins at below $5,000 are now sitting on more than 100% returns. Gains of that magnitude may lead more than a few small traders to lock in profits at current prices. The potential bullish impact of the reward halving on bitcoin’s price has been extensively discussed over the past few months. At the same time, the participation from large traders, popularly known as whales, and macro traders and institutions has gone up. The number of addresses holding at least 10,000 bitcoin recently rose to the highest since August. The metric has increased by over 10% since early March. Open interest, or open positions, in bitcoin futures listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange jumped to a record high of $489 million on Thursday. The CME open interest is widely considered as a proxy for macro traders or institutions. See also: Open Positions on Bitcoin Options Pass $1B for First TimeThus it appears large traders have priced in halving at least to some extent and may book profits following the halving, pushing prices lower. “As institutional investors have got involved, we believe the longstanding and well documented buy the rumor and sell the fact trading strategy will be a key driver of short-term price action,” said Hindi. While the cryptocurrency could come under pressure after halving, analysts are confident the dip would be short-lived.This is because the current macro environment may likely bolster bitcoin’s appeal as a hedge against inflation. Not only is bitcoin’s pace of supply expansion scheduled to drop by 50% next week, the supply cut is happening at a time when the major central banks are pumping unprecedented amounts of liquidity into the system to counter the negative impact of the coronavirus outbreak on the economy. “If inflation reigns going forward, bitcoin will go off the dial. I am currently amassing BTC,” said Clem Chambers, founder and CEO of financial markets website ADVFN.com. Richard Rosenblum, co-founder of crypto trading firm GSR, said the general retail and traditional financial communities are severely under-allocated versus traditional asset classes.As of now, Renaissance Technology and legendary trader Paul Tudor Jones II are the only known traditional market bigwigs to have forayed into cryptocurrencies. See also: Bitcoin Breaches $10K for First Time Since FebruaryThus, there are plenty of interested investors still waiting on the sidelines who could enter the market on price dips. Historical data also support the argument that post-halving dip would be short-lived. Bitcoin fell by nearly 30% in the four weeks following its second halving, which took place on July 9, 2016. In the following months, however, the cryptocurrency steadily gained altitude and rose to fresh record highs above $1,160 in March 2017. The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Data from major ...","May 8, 2020 at 12:27 UTC",Open contracts on bitcoin options rose to record highs on Thursday as the cryptocurrency’s price rose into five figures.,"Data from major exchanges – Deribit, LedgerX, Bakkt, OKEx, and CME – shows that open interest on options rose above $1 billion, surpassing the previous all-time high of $970 million registered on Feb. 14, according to crypto derivatives research firm Skew. The metric has increased sharply from the low of $410 million observed in March when the bitcoin market crashed on ""Black Thursday,"" March 12.Deribit, the world's biggest crypto options exchange by volume, contributed nearly 90% of the total on Thursday as open positions on the Panama-based exchange reached a record high of $903 million.Global options trading volume also jumped to $213.7 million yesterday, the highest level since the March 12 crash, while bitcoin itself clocked a two-month high of $10,062 on CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price index. At press time, bitcoin had dropped back to near $9,830, representing a 1.5% drop on the day, but an over 10% gain on a week-to-date basis. Options are derivative contracts that give the buyer the right, but not the obligation to buy or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A call option gives the purchaser the right to buy, while the put option gives the buyer the right to sell. Open interest refers to the number of options contracts that have
been traded but not yet liquidated by an offsetting trade or an exercise or
assignment. While open interest represents the number of contracts open at a
given point of time, trading volume refers to the number of contracts traded
during a specific period. The surge in open interest looks to have been caused by increased demand for put options, or bearish bets.  See also: Bitcoin Halving, Explained “Post-March crash, put options have been bought for downside protection primarily. As the market has rallied, more interest has entered via increased put accumulation,” said Tony Stewart, a derivatives trader and analyst in Deribit’s Market Insights channel. Validating Stewart's argument is the one-month put-call skew’s recent rise from -3% to 9.1%. The positive figure indicates that put options are costlier due to drawing greater demand than calls. Similar sentiments are being echoed by the put-call ratio, which rose to a 10-month high of 0.81 on Monday, according to Skew data. The put bias seen in the options market suggests investors may be hedging for a potential post-halving price drop. Bitcoin is set to undergo its third mining reward halving on Tuesday, following which the reward per block mined will drop to 12.5 BTC to 6.25 BTC. That the supply-altering event is a long-term bullish development has been extensively discussed by the analyst community for many months. Bitcoin’s price has rallied by nearly 160% since bottoming out at $3,867 in March and has recently decoupled from traditional markets as hype over the event mounts. Such strong rallies ahead of major events are often followed by price pullbacks. Historical data shows the cryptocurrency suffered a 30% drop in the four weeks following its second reward halving, which took place on July 9, 2016. “We may see the market drop by 25%-35% from the peak, but we expect it to be followed by a period of range-bound trading over a number of months and then a gradual move back up. The longer-term horizon for bitcoin is extremely bullish but in the short-to-medium term, we think we’ll see a lot of disappointed players out there,” said Ed Hindi, CIO of Tyr Capital Arbitrage SP, which focuses on liquidity provision and arbitrage within the cryptocurrency markets.See also: Bitcoin Breaches $10K for First Time Since FebruaryHence, it's not surprising that trades are buying hedges (puts)
against long positions in the spot or futures market. Bitcoin is widely expected to remain bid over the weekend due to ""FOMO"" buying from retail investors. FOMO, or fear of missing out, refers to panic buying in a rising market. Until the halving has passed, more price rises look likely. “$10,000 has already been breached and the psychological resistance of that has been overcome. We are keeping our eye on $10,500 as the next key level,” said Matthew Dibb, co-founder of Stack, a provider of cryptocurrency trackers and index funds. Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency at the time of writing.

Even if they don’t agree with his stance, he’s a well-known hedge fund investor, one of the great commodity inventors of all time, an iconic name in the “smart money” set. Most investors tend to follow the “smart money” – perhaps not right away, but the external validation from someone paid to be skeptical of hype will most likely act as a trigger for many. On the whole, investors tend to move as a herd.","Even more interesting are the reasons given: According to reports, he is buying bitcoin “as a hedge.” This is very different from funds speculating on bitcoin’s price going up. This is a hedge position, which is more fundamental and long-term. You're reading Crypto Long & Short, a newsletter that looks closely at the forces driving cryptocurrency markets. Authored by CoinDesk's head of research, Noelle Acheson, it goes out every Sunday and offers a recap of the week – with insights and analysis – from a professional investor's point of view. You can subscribe here.It also indicates an understanding of bitcoin’s value proposition. Crypto investors got excited when it was revealed a few weeks ago that Renaissance Technologies was contemplating trading bitcoin futures. Reniassance’s Medallion fund is a quant fund, interested in discrepancies in volatilities and other relatively obscure metrics. It doesn't really care about the underlying asset. Tudor Investment Corp., however, has studied bitcoin enough to understand its monetary properties and technological resilience.  This isn’t an institutional investor pontificating about the need for real assets in the face of unlimited money issuance and economic strain. This is hedge fund royalty publicly acknowledging that he is betting on bitcoin as a hedge. This is different.Back in 2015, in what feels like a lifetime ago but is only slightly more than the average age of your standard laptop, I read an article in CoinDesk about a conference held in Hong Kong. It featured a photo of a panel session that had generated a lot of excitement. For the first time, approximately 90% of Bitcoin mining hashpower (the computational capacity of network processing) was on the same stage. To many of us back then, Bitcoin mining had the allure of secrecy and power – it was the motor of the industry, and yet we knew so little about it: the who, the where, the with what.Fast forward to today, and bitcoin mining is still dominated by large mining pools based in China. But the sector has changed so much. First, the balance is shifting, with the growth of mining business in Europe, North America and elsewhere. Earlier this week, the Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance launched an interactive chart of hashpower distribution, which shows a notable drop in China’s concentration. (Tune in to our show on Consensus: Distributed TV tomorrow at 2:30 p.m. ET to hear Christine Kim talk to some of the principals leading this shift).  Second, the sector is much less secretive. A few days ago, mining pool Poolin released a report with detailed information on hashrate distribution and the energy costs of different machines, an unusual trove of information from a key industry operator. Miners appear to be more willing to talk: my CoinDesk Research colleague Christine Kim hosted a series of podcasts talking to miners about their businesses, and many contributed comments to our Bitcoin Halving Report. There are even miner-centric newsletters and podcasts. What’s more, some key miners are now listed companies, complying with the requisite disclosures which lend insight into how mining businesses are run. There is also a notable shift in the style and profile of bitcoin miners, towards more sophisticated structures and financial engineering. I’ve written before about how bitcoin markets are growing up. Bitcoin mining is, too. Some leading derivatives exchanges are offering increasingly flexible products. Rather than the quarterly maturities most common in traditional options, bitcoin options are now available for a range of settlement dates, which gives producers more flexibility.  Going even further, some infrastructure participants are designing tools specifically for miners. Late last year, crypto liquidity provider GSR announced a partnership to develop a “tailored risk management solution.” Some lenders have talked about structuring collateralized loans specifically for miners.And earlier this week, crypto data provider Coin Metrics unveiled a new type of hashrate index, which could remove some of the subjectivity of the traditional hashrate measure and serve as a basis for hashrate derivatives, allowing miners to hedge one of their main sources of uncertainty. Outside of financial products, the business itself becoming more investable. Cloud mining removes the need to deal with hardware issues, and some unrelated businesses are entering the mining game.With all this going on, it’s not hard to see why the third Bitcoin halving (in which the number of bitcoins issued to miners for their processing work gets halved), expected tomorrow, is so different from the previous two. The sector’s resilience no longer lies at the mercy of bitcoin issuance and market price. These are significant, yes, but there is a growing array of tools to mitigate their impact, and the profile of the participants in the mining industry is becoming more diverse. This adds resilience.The financialization of mining may dilute some of the original ethos of bitcoin as a decentralized, hard form of money; but the flexibility and relative stability it could add should make the market more resistant to protocol adjustments and price swings. U.S. job losses announced this week broke all records (20.5 million for April, 10 times the previous record decline in 1945), but that didn’t stop the S&P’s perplexing rise, which makes me wonder where investors think the earnings boost will come from. It’s not like companies will be buying back their own shares in bulk in this environment. Maybe the market thinks the Fed will start buying shares? Also disconcerting are indications that the futures market is pricing in negative rates. But is that enough to spook the market? Not yet. Momentum investing seems to be the ruling strategy. Speaking of momentum, bitcoin breaking $10,000 did not attract the fanfare it would have a few weeks ago. Just as well, since it was fleeting. (The chart below was compiled before an almost 20% drop, to just over $8,200 at time of writing on Sunday evening.) Crypto asset manager Bitwise has published a report that shows even a small allocation of bitcoin to multi-asset portfolios would have boosted cumulative returns, even if it was bought at the December 2017 high and rebalanced. TAKEAWAY: The advantages of a low correlation. Given the hype around the potential price impact of the upcoming bitcoin block subsidy halving, many believe the price will continue to go up afterwards. History shows that is not necessarily the case. TAKEAWAY: One of the reasons could be profit taking (“buy the rumor, sell the news”). Another could be an uptick in selling pressure as miners liquidate inventory to compensate the cut in income. Some investors probably fear weakened network resilience as a sell-off could push even more miners out of the market. Tomorrow’s halving has the added overlay of heightened general market risk. So, the bitcoin price might continue its upward trend post-halving … or, it might see a correction.Crypto data site Coin Metrics has created a hashrate index, intended to serve as the base for derivative products that could help miners and investors hedge their positions. TAKEAWAY: Miners can control their own hashrate, but they have no way of knowing how much of the total processing power of the sector their share accounts for – the hashrate index is based on an estimate derived from the time it takes to mine recent blocks. The new “observed work” metric aims to remove some of the subjectivity around hashrate observations, and could form the basis of hashrate derivatives. As I stressed in THE BRIEFING above, the crypto mining sector is maturing at a breathtaking pace. Transactions on the Ethereum blockchain have reached their highest level since the summer of 2019. TAKEAWAY: This is likely due to the strong growth in stablecoin transactions and supply – most stablecoins run on Ethereum. It could also be partially due to the impending network shift to proof-of-stake, as the number of addresses holding 32 or more ETH – the minimum required to become a network validator – has increased sharply.Tether is easily the leader in the stablecoin pack in terms of market cap and growth – yet that growth is not evenly distributed amongst its various forms. Supply on Omni, the first tether blockchain, is declining, while that on Ethereum and Tron is growing fast. TAKEAWAY: This discrepancy shows why it’s important to look into the nuts and bolts of the blockchain on which your stablecoin of choice runs. Omni, based on the Bitcoin blockchain, is more robust than other blockchains, and has multisig capabilities (which allow for more complex transaction configurations). However, it also suffers sudden transaction fee spikes and longer confirmation times. The decline in its use shows what stablecoin characteristics users value more. Every day, around mid-morning New York time, the average bitcoin transaction fee spikes for up to an hour, then returns to normal. A recent paper claims that this is due to crypto derivative exchange BitMEX’s policy of transmitting thousands of transactions at once, at the same time every day. TAKEAWAY: Bitcoin transaction fees are not obligatory, but are usually estimated by wallet software according to the network congestion at the time. Users tend to accept whatever is proposed, since insisting on paying lower fees implies a potentially longer processing wait. What’s interesting here is that exchanges can influence the fees that users pay miners, even without being at all involved in the transaction.Nearly 85% of bitcoin addresses are “in the money,” having accumulated their bitcoin at a lower average price than the current market price. TAKEAWAY: Some investors believe this implies potential selling pressure, as investors start to take profits. Crypto data provider CryptoCompare has released its April 2020 Exchange Review, which shows that derivatives volumes fell by 25% over the month, while spot volumes were down only 13%. TAKEAWAY: Part of the derivatives decline may be the fallout from the March crash, as high-risk traders retreated to lick their wounds. BitMEX, traditionally the largest crypto derivatives exchange by volume and one of the protagonists behind the Black Thursday slump, has lost its throne, slipping to fourth place, behind Huobi, OKEx and Binance. It seems that network effects aren’t everything when it comes to market infrastructure totem poles. Volumes on most derivative exchanges may be down (see above), but open interest on the CME is at an all-time high. TAKEAWAY: The CME’s volume is negligible in comparison to offshore exchanges such as OKEx and Binance, but it is the derivatives platform that regulated U.S.-based financial institutions must use. Renaissance Technologies recently disclosed that it was contemplating trading crypto derivatives on the CME; and Paul Tudor Jones' revelation earlier this week has led many to speculate he’s behind a large part of the open interest growth. Whoever is accumulating positions, the OI growth on the CME is a sign that institutions are coming back into the market after the risk-averse retreat following Black Thursday in March. And the fact that the OI growth is outstripping volume growth shows that these accumulators are not short-term traders.The Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance has launched a new interactive Bitcoin mining map, which visualizes the average monthly share of Bitcoin’s hashrate by country for the first time, and provides an exclusive visualisation of China’s hashrate distribution at the provincial level. TAKEAWAY: China has 65% of bitcoin hashrate. This is lower than in the past, and is likely to continue to shift as hardware technology advances and business models become more financialized. My colleague Christine Kim is hosting a talk on Monday, May 11 as part of our Crypto Long & Short show at Consensus: Distributed, in which she’ll be speaking to representatives from some of the large North American crypto mining groups that are emerging. Digital Assets Research has produced a review of notable institutional interest in blockchain projects and crypto assets. TAKEAWAY: This was a fun read, I confess I’d lost sight of many of these projects. The report shows that, while the initial hype has been subdued under a barrage of delays and corporate shifts, there is still a significant amount of work going on in so many different areas of capital markets. Even if most of the projects do not end up in production, this will further our collective knowledge of the limitations and the potential. Iran’s Ministry of Industry, Mine and Trade has granted a cryptocurrency mining license to Turkey-based iMiner, which plans to operate up to 6,000 mining rigs in the city of Semnan.  TAKEAWAY: Without going into the utility of the potential use case in nations hit by sanctions and the punitive effect on individuals and businesses of a lack of dollars, one aspect investors should keep an eye on is broadening adoption. This is an example, and given Iran’s famously low average energy cost, could end up becoming a robust industry in the country. (Also, keep an eye out for Leigh Cuen's series looking at cryptocurrency adoption in emerging markets.)Crypto exchange Bitfinex has launched a derivative (BTCDOM) that allows investors to take a position on bitcoin's overall share of the cryptocurrency market. TAKEAWAY: The relatively light oversight on some offshore exchanges allows for rapid creativity when it comes to crypto derivative products. Greater choice for investors and traders is not a bad thing, if the risks are identified and monitored. Swiss fintech firm Amun has launched a daily inverse token, BTCSHORT (BTCS), which returns gains based on inverse price movements of bitcoin in a given 24-hour period. The product complements a recent bitcoin inverse exchange-traded product (ETP) released by Amun in January. TAKEAWAY: Hedging has long been a part of advanced crypto portfolios, the emergence of tokens such as these should make more sophisticated portfolio structures available to a wider audience, as they don’t require complicated margin provisioning, and they can be used for hedging but also as a speculation tool. Eris Clearing, the clearing and settlement arm of crypto platform ErisX, has been granted a BitLicense from New York's Department of Financial Services. TAKEAWAY: Not an easy thing to get, given the procedural hurdles and the cost – since the requirement went into effect in 2015, fewer than 30 firms have been awarded the license. This places another institutional-grade exchange within reach of Wall Street firms (that aren’t based in New Jersey).The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

With its flagship AntMiner bitcoin mining equipment still dominating the hardware market and its mining pools accounting for about a quarter of the Bitcoin network’s computing power, it retains a uniquely powerful place in the ecosystem of by far the largest cryptocurrency and blockchain project. ","That’s not to say it isn’t also controversial. Its vocal support for a Bitcoin hard fork (Bitcoin Cash) in 2017, following contentious community disagreement, won the company, and its masterminds, many enemies. This post is part of the CoinDesk 50, an annual selection of the most innovative and consequential projects in the blockchain industry. See the full list here.Over the years, Bitmain has been involved in many controversial developments to the point that the Chinese crypto community refers to its foes as the “mining avengers.” In 2017, Bitmain filed a lawsuit against Yang Zuoxing, the former design chief behind Bitmain’s AntMiner S9 who started a rival miner manufacturer MicroBT, over patent infringement. But Bitmain lost the case eventually. Then in 2018, it brought another lawsuit over non-compete violation against the former creators of Bitman’s mining pool BTC.com, who left the company to start a rival service PoolIn, which has become the world’s top two bitcoin mining pool by total hash rate.Bitmain’s story started with Wu Jihan, one of the earliest bitcoin evangelists in China, translating Satoshi Nakamoto’s white paper to Chinese in 2011. He invested in probably the world’s first known bitcoin-denominated initial public offering in 2012. It was a project started by Jiang Xinyu, a.k.a Friedcat., who was crowdfunding bitcoin to roll out an application-specific integrated circuit just for bitcoin mining.The hardware sold well initially and sensational success followed. In 2013, Wu, with a finance and psychology degree from China’s prestigious Peking University, decided to start his own company to manufacture mining hardware. He was joined by Zhan Ketuan, his partner on the technology side, who, in six years, would find himself ousted from the company in a coup started by Wu.Bitcoin’s last halving event in the summer 2016 marked the beginning of two years of extraordinary growth at Bitmain. In 2017 alone, still only four years old, it made $1 billion in profits. It made another $1 billion for the first six months in 2018 and then went on a high-profile fundraise in the summer, netting $700 million from external shareholders with a bet. The deal is this: if Bitmain can’t go public within five years since the fundraise at an agreed term, external investors could require the company to redeem all of their investment with an interest. At that time, Bitmain was boasting a hardware market share of nearly 80 percent. So the agreed term for the IPO was nothing but ambitious: raising at least $500 million at a valuation of no less than $18 billion.So much has changed in 2019, since its first IPO attempt failed in March in Hong Kong. Its rising rival, MicroBT, whose founder won over Bitmain’s patent infringement lawsuit, is seriously undermining Bitmain’s market dominance.In 2019, Bitmain’s mining pools BTC.com and Antpool lost the top two spots to F2Pool and Poolin, the latter of which still has an ongoing case with Bitmain over alleged non-compete violation.When Wu Jihan returned in a coup in November 2019 to kick out his founding partner Zhan, he told his people he’s back to save the sinking ship. Whether his tough comeback will work as he expected is yet to be proven, although it appears prepared to roll out more powerful equipment to weather the upcoming halving.It remains to be seen if Bitmain can replicate the sensational success it once had following the 2016 bitcoin halving. The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The first installment explored bitcoin adoption in the Middle East and the second covered Africa.","Some believe the broader economic crisis might lead to “dollarization” in emerging markets, where people increasingly use global currencies like dollars instead of their local fiat. It remains unclear how bitcoin will play into that prospective shift, as bitcoin is still too immature to be predominately used as a competing currency. But crypto entrepreneurs are still giving it a try anyway.The Colombia-based startup Valiu offers Latin Americans access to remittances and bitcoin-backed, synthetic dollar savings accounts. This means you can send fiat across borders and, when you’re not cashing out, the value is denominated in dollars by behind-the-scenes bitcoin derivatives. Register: Leigh Cuen Hosts “Crypto Across Emerging Markets” on May 11 at Consensus: DistributedWhen the startup partnered with the Open Money Initiative for market research, it found demand from members of the Venezuelan diaspora for fiat remittances and dollar-denominated savings spurred by Venezuela’s pre-coronavirus economic collapse. “We have a trading and risk engine where we buy and sell bitcoin, that’s how we provide the service,” Valiu CEO Simon Chamorro said.Users can pay in debit, credit or even cash to get into the system, Chamorro added. Bitcoin is then used to transfer value on the backend. “It was an incomplete solution to offer [pesos-to-bolivar] remittances because as soon as they received the money, they had to spend it,” he said. “We knew we needed a dollar solution.”So far, in 2020, the Valiu mobile app garnered 40,000 downloads and roughly 5,000 monthly active users. Chamorro said there’s also growing demand from Mexico and Argentina because, like Venezuela and Colombia, these nations are experiencing high inflation and are home to many migrant communities. Indeed, researcher Matt Ahlborg wrote LocalBitcoins users in Argentina set new record highs this week with more than $105,000 in daily volume on LocalBitcoins. Meanwhile, dollar-denominated stablecoins offer another type of dollarization. Argentinian crypto exchange founder Federico Ogue, CEO of Buenbit and Buendolar, said many users who are buying cryptocurrency for the first time are attracted to dollar-denominated stablecoins, like dai. This is also thanks, in part, to active marketing campaigns supported by the Maker Foundation. These new clients tend to buy small amounts, Ogue said. Even so, he said there were so many new users during the lockdown that volumes nearly doubled on the peak day in April. With regards to bitcoin, Ahlborg’s tally of volumes from both Paxful and LocalBitcoins show peer-to-peer trading volumes in Argentina may be growing at a slower rate than other Latin American crypto hubs like Venezuela or Colombia. So far, it appears MakerDAO may be the most widely promoted altcoin project in both Argentina and Brazil. Over in Brazil, the Stellar-based Moeda Marketplace spun up a food market during the coronavirus crisis. The startup works with agricultural companies like Agro Organic to offer 80 different food products with a two-day delivery time. In the first few weeks of operation, the startup earned $20,000, serving 300 customers. Next, the plan is to expand to several major cities in Brazil.Unlike Venezuela and Argentina, which were already embroiled in an economic crisis, Brazil’s economy was relatively stable before the coronavirus hit. As such, crypto adoption has been much lower in Brazil despite its size. The local stock market provided sufficient investment opportunities for traders, without needing to look abroad. Plus, Binance’s Brazil communications lead, Mayra Siqueira, said bitcoin has a reputation problem in her homeland. Before the pandemic, people overwhelmingly associated cryptocurrency with scams and quick riches. Siqueira said there are roughly 60 crypto exchanges operating in Brazil, out of which the leading exchange has only opened 1.5 million accounts to date. But awareness is growing, Siqueira said, with Binance onboarding 16% more Brazilian users in Q1 2020 than in Q4 2019.   Now that Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro is leaning toward “authoritarian” tendencies, she said, more people are looking to bitcoin as a long-term savings option or a way to transact across borders.“There’s a fear that we might be becoming a dictatorship again,” Siqueira said, referencing the military regime that gripped Brazil for two decades until 1985. “We’re not seeing international investment coming to Brazil any time soon because we’re politically unstable. We’re going to see more crypto adoption because of that.”In some ways, Moeda is an example of that. The token project leverages global platforms like Binance for small loans and operational liquidity while serving local clients in Brazil.  CoinDesk senior reporter Leigh Cuen hosts the “Crypto Across Emerging Markets” panel on May 11 at 7:30 p.m. ET at Consensus: Distributed, CoinDesk's first virtual, free conference. Register here.Rosine Kadamani, founder of the educational Blockchain Academy in Brazil, described Moeda as Brazil’s first “true initial coin offering” back in 2017. Since then, the startup has worked with small businesses in ways that “represent an interesting gain for all the involved.” Critics might argue Moeda doesn’t need a token to serve these Brazilian businesses. Regardless, the company appears to be performing like other comparable tech providers in the region. Plus, Moeda CEO Miss Reis was already working with agricultural cooperatives for years before the crisis hit. Unlike dai adoption, which is promoted by the Maker Foundation, the Stellar Foundation is not affiliated with Moeda in any way. As such, the Brazilian case illustrates that crypto usage in “emerging markets” isn’t uniform at all.Although some Brazilians have already lost their life savings in ill-advised crypto investments, Siqueira said, that doesn’t mean altcoin projects in emerging markets are inherently exploitative or artificial. Sometimes inflation drives crypto adoption, especially when paired with weak banking infrastructure. But Siqueira said Brazilians trust banks more than they do in Argentina, for example. In this case, it’s not that bitcoin users generally distrust local banks. Instead, there’s simply higher demand for accessible and transparent loan services than there is local supply.  So some entrepreneurs take initiative on their own and use altcoins to find international lenders or investors interested in small-to-medium scale opportunities. Digital payments, in general, make it cheaper and easier to transact across borders. So a modest profit can be more attractive to lenders and investors abroad. Someday traditional institutions may be more accessible. As of today, cryptocurrency provides a workaround.Jorge Farias, a Venezuelan expat and CEO of the Panama-based startup Cryptobuyer, said this year his company plans to establish 20,000 crypto-friendly point-of-sale devices across Venezuela. This bitcoin business also supports altcoins like ether and dai, because it’s profitable for Cryptobuyer to do so. Other bitcoin companies are interested in supporting tokens as well. “We’re not closing the door on stablecoins. We can also use them as collateral,” Chamorro said of trendy altcoins like dai.As for Chamorro’s case in Colombia, he said his startup’s $1.25 million raise from Y Combinator in San Francisco went a lot further than it might for competitors because most of his staff lives in Latin America. Across the board, all parties agreed access to education is the crucial factor that enables adoption, not scams. “Brazil requires more education,” Binance’s Siqueria said. “As soon as we see a better fiat offering in Brazil, we’ll see a lot of growth.”CoinDesk senior reporter Leigh Cuen hosts the “Crypto Across Emerging Markets” panel on May 11 at 7:30 p.m. ET at Consensus: Distributed, CoinDesk's first virtual, free conference.

holdings. Phan was attracted to the “philosophy of bitcoin” and ...","May 9, 2020 at 11:00 UTC",The first woman to gain more than a million YouTube subscribers is now going all-in on bitcoin to promote financial freedom to her loyal fanbase.,"“I kind of view bitcoin as similar to YouTube, which was part of the decentralization of content,” said beauty mogul Michelle Phan. “[Bitcoin] is the decentralization of power.” Phan, who turned online beauty tutorials into a $50 million business, learned about bitcoin while researching gold in 2011. When Phan started raking in money on YouTube, she wanted to diversify her holdings. Phan was attracted to the “philosophy of bitcoin” and already had a knack for teaching online. Jack Dorsey is perhaps the only other bitcoin mogul with a comparably mainstream reputation. Likewise, Phan now has a hand in several complementary companies, including an investment in the music startup Thematic, which helps YouTubers use music without violating copyright infringement. Since the beauty industry has yet to recover from the makeup crash of 2019, it’s increasingly common for women to shop online or run direct-to-consumer brands predominately sold through the social media strategies Phan pioneered. Fans can expect her to continue investing horizontally, in different components of the internet-native retail chain.My viewers are hungry for more than makeup and skincare. They want to know how to protect their purchasing power.In some ways, the beauty industry is now comparable to the crypto industry. Digital marketing is dominated by social media influencers like Phan, who modeled how such influencers can make money without compromising on honest product reviews. Beauty product consumers create passionate, highly engaged online communities. (Debates about facial scrubs and lipstick on such forums can be as controversial as the most toxic Bitcoin Twitter debate.) In that world, Phan is seen as much more than a lipstick peddler. She broke the monopoly once held by fashion magazines to shape makeup trends. On Monday, May 11 at 5:30 p.m. ET, you can ask Michelle anything during an AMA at Consensus: Distributed, CoinDesk's first virtual, free conference. Register here.Beauty influencer Roxette Arisa, who has nearly 1.2 million YouTube subscribers and marketed Em Cosmetics, described Phan as an “inspiration” who popularized themed tutorials, like “Sailor Moon” or “Bad Girl,” and beauty content aimed at more than triggering purchases. Phan has a holistic, health-oriented approach, distinguishing her makeup brand through educational content as well. “We’ve seen a huge shift from traditional sources [like magazines] to digital media,” Arisa said. “She [Phan] was doing stuff no one was doing at the time. Her production value was so high and she was always coming up with different looks.”While tech bros in Silicon Valley chase venture capital by promising to “disrupt” a sector, Phan actually did it, completely bootstrapped. She retained a loyal audience for more than a decade by inviting fans to view themselves as self-taught experts, too.As such, Phan started using her social channels to promote bitcoin when the recession started in March. This is, in part, because her businesses and brand were finally mature enough to afford an unconventional risk. Most beauty influencers focus on makeup tutorials, not financial literacy. Plus, Phan said an economic crisis like this one is “when bitcoin really shines.” “Now my viewers are hungry for more than makeup and skincare. They want to know how to protect their purchasing power,” Phan said. “I am investing a lot of my time and energy into helping promote mass adoption for bitcoin.”For fans like crypto-savvy investor and skincare connoisseur Katherine Wu of Notation Capital, Phan has a trustworthy brand that Wu is excited to see expand to financial education. “She very much shaped my relationship with makeup, skincare and, in some ways, charting an off-beat path,” Wu said. “Michelle has a very different reach and audience than people like Jack Dorsey and Andrew Yang.”From Wu’s perspective, Phan isn’t just another famous bitcoiner. Phan makes the technology seem less intimidating. In fact, she makes it seem completely normal, in a good way. ALSO FROM CONSENSUS MAGAZINE 2020:The CoinDesk 50, by CoinDesk staffCrypto in Corona: From Switzerland to Liberland, by Jeff WilserThe Men Who Stare at Charts, by Ben MunsterThe Changemaker: Glen Weyl Puts His Radical Ideas Into Action, by Jeff WilserThe Man Who Saw a Currency Cold War, by Jeff WilserGeneration Crypto, by Jess Klein“Bitcoin has enabled a lot of people to pursue career paths in ways that were not possible before,” Wu said, adding many aspiring entrepreneurs are inspired to follow Phan’s self-sovereign approach. “So she could play a bigger role in bringing her core base into crypto.” Phan is building a retail empire by incorporating bitcoin, a public good created by a group outside herself, into her broader business model. She said she’ll start with educational content, then potentially move on to working with e-commerce startups like Lolli and Fold, which helps users earn and spend bitcoin.“Of course I want to accept bitcoin, but I feel like consumers aren’t ready yet to purchase things with their bitcoin,” Phan said. Michelle has a very different reach and audience than people like Jack Dorsey and Andrew Yang.Instead, she believes now is the time to focus on teaching people how and why to hold their own bitcoin. She’s already earned fans’ loyalty for years and can grow with them as the economy changes. Plus, as an employer with a dozen people on staff, Phan also needs to prioritize revenue and stability for her cosmetics brand during the COVID-19 crisis. “It’s benefited us, being direct-to-consumer, because that’s what we’re used to. Anyone in retail right now is suffering,” Phan said, adding that bitcoiners’ self-sovereign ethos shaped her entrepreneurial approach. “The beauty of my brand is I own it, I own 100% of it.” It was a hard road that led Phan to own a lucrative brand that she controlled enough to take a risk on promoting bitcoin. She told Racked her father had a gambling problem and, as the daughter of Vietnamese refugees, her family “grew up poor.” Phan uploaded her first makeup tutorial to YouTube in 2007, when she was 19. She was thousands of dollars in debt, but started earning roughly 25 cents a week from her videos within the first year. As her popularity grew, Lancôme hired her in 2010 as its official video makeup artist. In 2011, around the time she started tumbling down the bitcoin rabbit hole, Phan also co-founded the beauty subscription company IPSY, which raised over $100 million in venture capital. It is still considered one of the leading beauty startups in the market today. When Phan launched her first product line with L'Oréal in 2013, it flopped because it was deemed too expensive. Phan was already juggling a successful company, IPSY, the paparazzi and her model boyfriend, Dominique Capraro, who speaks Italian and could grate cheese on his abs. Unlike the lam-bros chasing women and fame, Phan had it all before she took a risk by going public about bitcoin. She could have let the L'Oréal blunder fade into history and ditched startup life for the red carpet. But Phan is a builder, not a celebrity. She bought back the cosmetics line in 2015, eventually relaunching Em Cosmetics as her own company, running it her way. By 2019, the brand was so popular some products sold out. Phan played a pivotal role in decentralizing the beauty industry, once dominated by retail gatekeepers and fashion elites. Now a generation of women are making and selling products with direct-to-consumer or peer-to-peer distribution strategies. Next, the 32-year-old bitcoiner set her sights on changing how people talk about money.  “You’re buying digital real estate. … There could be future cryptocurrencies backed by bitcoin, but bitcoin is the reserve,” Phan said. “Bitcoin is the truest money that we should have had since the beginning of time.”The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

There were only five minutes left on the clock. Zhao was looking confident; he had just batted away a thorny question about an ongoing lawsuit. It was looking like the home stretch. Then it hit. Shin asked the one question Zhao really didn't want to have to answer, but many want to know: Where is Binance's headquarters?This seemingly simple question is actually more complex. Until February, Binance was considered to be based in Malta. That changed when the island European nation announced that, no, Binance is not under its jurisdiction. Since then Binance has not said just where, exactly, it is now headquartered.Little wonder that when asked Zhao reddened; he stammered. He looked off-camera, possibly to an aide. ""Well, I think what this is is the beauty of the blockchain, right, so you don't have to ... like where's the Bitcoin office, because Bitcoin doesn't have an office,"" he said. The line trailed off, then inspiration hit. ""What kind of horse is a car?"" Zhao asked. Binance has loads of offices, he continued, with staff in 50 countries. It was a new type of organization that doesn't need registered bank accounts and postal addresses. ""Wherever I sit, is going to be the Binance office. Wherever I need somebody, is going to be the Binance office,"" he said.See also: Binance Is Not Under Our Jurisdiction, Says Malta RegulatorZhao may have been hoping the host would move onto something easier. But Shin wasn't finished: ""But even to do things like to handle, you know, taxes for your employees, like, I think you need a registered business entity, so like why are you obfuscating it, why not just be open about it like, you know, the headquarters is registered in this place, why not just say that?""Zhao glanced away again, possibly at the person behind the camera. Their program had less than two minutes remaining. ""It's not that we don't want to admit it, it's not that we want to obfuscate it or we want to kind of hide it. We're not hiding, we're in the open,"" he said. Shin interjected: ""What are you saying that you're already some kind of DAO [decentralized autonomous organization]? I mean what are you saying? Because it's not the old way [having a headquarters], it's actually the current way ... I actually don't know what you are or what you're claiming to be.""Zhao said Binance isn't a traditional company, more a large team of people ""that works together for a common goal."" He added: ""To be honest, if we classified as a DAO, then there's going to be a lot of debate about why we're not a DAO. So I don't want to go there, either.""""I mean nobody would call you guys a DAO,"" Shin said, likely disappointed that this wasn't the interview where Zhao made his big reveal.See also: Binance CEO Says Crypto Exchange Has Applied for a Singapore LicenseTime was up. For an easy question to close, Shin asked where Zhao was working from during the coronavirus pandemic. ""I'm in Asia,"" Zhao said.

","According to a source close to Zhan, who was ousted by his rival co-founder Wu Jihan last October, the former executive was recently granted the right to recover his status as the legal representative of Beijing Bitmain Technology by the Beijing Haidian District Justice Bureau. On Friday morning local time, as Zhan attended the bureau to collect his new registration license as part of the recovery process, he was surrounded by dozens of men including Bitmain’s Chief Executive Liu Luyao, according to the source, who was at the scene at the time.According to a report by Chinese news source Caixin on Friday, as officials from the Justice Bureau attempted to hand over the updated license to Zhan as the firm's new legal representative, Liu abruptly took possession of the license, saying, “The business license is company property, how can it fall in to the hands of an individual?""According to a video circulating on WeChat seen and verified by CoinDesk, the tensions between the two sides later escalated into a physical confrontation. After the Justice Bureau reported the incident to the police, both parties were taken to the local police station. The confrontation marks the latest development in Bitmain's internal struggle following last year's sudden coup, and deepens the uncertainties surrounding the firm's senior management ahead of a planned initial public offering in the U.S.Zhan's latest partial legal victory returning his legal representative status followed an another win last month. A legal representative for a Chinese company usually holds broad powers to act on a company's behalf. In a statement issued by Bitmain on Friday, the company takes its aim at the Justice Bureau, saying the decision to reverse the registration is a ""mistake"" made by the government agency that ""has severely violated the Company Law [of China]."" ""We recognize Liu Luyao as the currently effective legal representative of Beijing Bitmain,"" the firm said. ""During this period, we will not acknowledge any action taken by Zhan Ketuan as a legal representative of Beijing Bitmain and reserve the rights to file legal claims against Zhan and related parties.""However, the internal fight to control the world's largest bitcoin miner make is far from over.

note ...","May 11, 2020 at 00:01 UTC","National economies are sinking into a recession but the bitcoin economy remains healthy and is still growing throughout the coronavirus crisis, even surging to $10,000 on May 7.","Crypto hedge funds, in particular, are reaping the benefits of volatility. For example, Eric Ervin, co-founder of Blockforce Capital in San Diego, said his fund’s returns are up 18% so far in 2020.“In these wild months, we’re capturing half of the upside,” Ervin said, referring to the economic rollercoaster that took off in March. “Bitcoin’s really taken a lot of market share back from Ethereum … really dominated as Ethereum tries to figure itself out.”It’s important to note bitcoin’s market dominance during a global crisis is a cause of correlation, not causation. The godfather cryptocurrency was already surging in 2019. According to the annual report released Monday by Elwood Asset Management and the consulting company PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), the value of assets under management at crypto hedge funds more than doubled in 2019 to reach $2 billion.According to PwC partner Henri Arslanian, co-author of the report that surveyed over 50 funds, more crypto hedge funds trade ether (ETH), 67%, than any type of crypto derivatives (56%), although bitcoin still reigned supreme in 2019 (97%).Read more: Crypto M&A and Fundraising Dropped Sharply in 2019: PwC ReportArslanian said the coronavirus crisis inspired more investors to adamantly ask how hedge fund managers reduce counterparty risks, for example, not leaving too much money on any single exchange. If these concerns are quelled, more investors appear eager to enter the market, he said.""One macro trend we’ve seen since the coronavirus is more general interest in cryptocurrencies,” Arslanian told CoinDesk in an interview.The vast majority of these funds serve family offices and high-net-worth individuals, an average of 28 individuals per fund, suggesting the technology’s leading use case isn’t “financial inclusion” quite yet. (Many of these funds alone represent more global market share than the known peer-to-peer bitcoin trading volumes of some countries.)This is why bitcoin appears to be correlated to traditional assets like stocks. When the same small groups own significant chunks of multiple markets, their behavior influences those markets in similar ways. Diversifying ownership is the only way to decorrelate an asset class. In the meantime, traders and investors are making a killing. The PwC report found the percentage of crypto hedge funds with more than $20 million under management jumped up from 19% to 35% of surveyed funds – shocking growth considering the median starting point for these funds was $2 million. “We’re starting to notice people are taking our calls a little bit more. There’s a little more interest,” Blockforce Capital’s Ervin said. Plus, the market shocks in March didn’t feel like an emergency to veteran bitcoin traders.Paul Veradittakit, co-founder of crypto investment firm Pantera Capital, agreed, saying his fund spent a lot of time so far in 2020 educating nervous investors.“We wanted to make sure the investors knew what was going on in the market,” Veradittakit said. “We’re rebalancing a bit more into bitcoin to focus on what we think will be the rallying point for crypto during this time.”Read more: ‘Black Thursday’ Distortion Makes Bitcoin Options Look CheaperAlthough the venture arm of Pantera is now focused on fewer startups and ensuring those investments have at least 18 months of runway, Veradittakit said overall 2020 has seen the fund’s largest amount of deployed capital to date. A few funds, including Scalar Capital and Polychain Capital, declined to offer comment on their updated strategies by press time.“[Black Thursday] wasn’t that uncharacteristic of bitcoin, historically,” Ervin said, adding the same concept applies to ETH, which outperformed bitcoin in some previous years.“[Big business] has embraced Ethereum, and that’s meaningful,” Ervin said. “There’s a significant amount of resources dedicated to Ethereum.”That’s why the competition is more crowded than ever before. The PwC report tallied at least 150 active crypto hedge funds, more than 63% of which were launched in the past two years.

Jones’ flagship $22 billion Tudor BVI Global Fund has been authorized to hold as much as “a low single-digit percentage exposure percentage"" of its assets in bitcoin futures, according to a note sent to investors this month. It is not clear whether the fund has begun buying futures, what kind (physically delivered or cash-settled), on which exchange it would do so or whether it plans to also trade the underlying commodity.Bitcoin Halving Interest Doubles (Five Times Over)With fewer than four days left till bitcoin's halving, popular interest in the once-every-four-years event is reaching a fever pitch. Google Trends, a barometer for gauging interest in trending search topics, shows searches for ""halving"" or ""bitcoin halving"" at five times the peak in 2016, when the blockchain underwent its previous halving event.

","The doubling would happen ""within a year,"" Vice President of Product Michael Jack told CoinDesk. He said Coinme bitcoin ATM growth ""both on a per location and overall basis, has been very strong.""The company already has plans to plug Coinme's exchange API into more kiosks, though Jack did not specify how soon this would happen. Coinstar has a global fleet of nearly 20,000 kiosks, according to its website. The deliberations come as Coinme lays claim to a veritable accomplishment of the COVID-19 era: It's bringing in new customers, even while other businesses flounder. Coinme CEO Neil Bergquist told CoinDesk that 40% of transactions since late February are by first-timers.One reason for the surge may be the placement of Coinme bitcoin ATMs almost exclusively in supermarkets and pharmacies, just about the only brick-and-mortar establishments that remained open to consumer foot traffic through COVID-19 lockdowns.Read more: Bitcoin ATMs Expand Despite Shelter-in-Place RulesThat twist of fate let Coinme ""provide uninterrupted access"" to customers, Bergquist said. As panicking shoppers flocked to grocery stores in mid-March on lockdown supply runs, some were apparently also bulking up on crypto: Bitcoin transaction volume at Coinme kiosks is up 40% since late February. Coinme also saw a “slight uptick” in $1,200 transactions – the same dollar amount as coronavirus stimulus checks sent to Americans by the Treasury Dept. – “although we're not seeing a strong correlation,” Bergquist said.“The recent increase in sales certainly helped remove any concerns around company performance and durability during the pandemic,” Bergquist said.The news immediately follows Coinme's Thursday announcement that it had raised $10 million in Series A funding from Coinstar, Blockchain.com Ventures, Hard Yaka, Nima Capital and Pantera Capital, who led the ongoing round with $5.5 million. Pantera now controls a seat on the Coinme board of directors.Even before the spike, Pantera partner Paul Veradittakit said his VC firm likes Coinme’s boots on the ground business model. He said it appeals to consumers curious about bitcoin and who are certainly familiar with the concept of ATMs but perhaps not ready to open an account with an online exchange.“People aren't there yet in terms of education, people aren't there in terms of technology,” he said. “This is the way to get the mainstream user, the general public, the folks that are going to grocery stores” to buy bitcoin.Bergquist said Coinme would use the cash to expand its business in Latin America. Because it builds an exchange API rather than an actual machines, Coinme can plug bitcoin buying into just about any compatible device: “kiosks, ATMs, [Point of Sale], and merchants” in Latin American countries, Bergquist said.“They want to be the backend, they want to be the pipes to make money move around the world in a much more seamless way,” said Veradittakit.CORRECTION (8 May 15:17 UTC): A previous version of this story incorrectly reported that Michael Jack was President of Product Management and that Coinstar would roll out new machines that feature Coinme.

Lousy For Main Street. May 8, 2020 at 17:07 UTC Updated May 10, 2020 at 
19:03 ...","May 8, 2020 at 17:07 UTC","In early March 2012, three years after the biggest financial disruption in 80 years, with 8% of the U.S. workforce unemployed, with four million American homes foreclosed and with Europe tearing itself apart over fiscal austerity measures to contain a debt crisis, someone forked over $119 million for a painting.","The price, paid by an anonymous bidder at a Sotheby’s auction for Edvard Munch’s “Scream,” smashed the record price for fine art set when Pablo Picasso’s “Nude, Green Leaves, and Bust” sold for $106.5 million two years earlier. What was striking when I wrote about this eight years ago, was that the trend in the consumer price index was then extremely soft. The scourge was not inflation but employment-killing deflation. The Federal Reserve had slashed rates to zero and was spending hundreds of billions of freshly created dollars on government bonds in a mostly failing bid to recharge investment and consumer spending and drive CPI inflation up to its target rate of 2%.You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. You can subscribe to this and all of CoinDesk’s newsletters here.Meanwhile, rare art prices were soaring – a powerful illustration of the inequitable payoffs from monetary and fiscal stimulus. An April 9 viral tweet showed that a similarly stark contrast is already playing out in the even harsher crisis of COVID-19. With its unlimited “quantitative easing,” or QE, campaign  throwing trillions of dollars not only at Treasury debt but at risky “junk bonds” too, the Fed is handing Wall Street an asset inflation payoff while Main Street stares down the barrel of deflation. As investor Preston Pysh points out in the first episode of The Breakdown’s “Money Reimagined” limited podcast series, the absence of mainstream inflation seems incongruous, even frustrating, to people – including many in the crypto community – who assume rampant central-bank money printing will destroy consumers’ spending power. They are looking, he says, in the wrong place: QE inflation will manifest not in the prices of everyday things but in assets owned by the wealthiest in society. Like stocks. And Picassos.  “That’s where I think the ‘money printer go brrrrr’ meme is confusing a lot of people,” Pysh said, referring to a Crypto Twitter favorite inspired by this tweet from investor and Consensus: Distributed speaker Meltem Demirors “Because they are looking at the CPI bucket and you’re not going to see it there.”There’s a lesson here for bitcoin investors but before I get to that, let’s be blunt about society’s core problem. It is not consumer inflation, not for now, at least. It is the failure of  a Wall Street-dependent monetary policy framework that socializes the losses and privatizes the profits of wealthy financiers while disenfranchising everyone else. As Pysh explains, the world economy is stuck in a broken cycle that stems from the world’s heavy addiction to dollars. The reserve-currency dollar’s dominance of global credit markets ensures that during crises, it almost always experiences a self-fulfilling appreciation that helps nobody other than holders of U.S. financial assets. Overseas debtors scramble for greenbacks to make payments in response to skittish creditors’ margin calls, only to face even bigger problems as their depreciating local currencies make their dollar debts even harder to pay. The Fed has no choice but to flood the world with dollars to prevent markets from seizing up. In the U.S., meanwhile, foreign inflows and the Fed’s emergency measures lead to lower interest rates, which lets the government roll over debts and make stimulus payments despite a dangerously expanding deficit. Washington’s loyalties being what they are, very little of those politically directed bailouts make their way into American consumers’ pockets. What they get – courtesy of the stronger dollar – is lower inflation, or even income-depleting deflation. Right now, burdened with student loans and credit card debt, that’s the last thing they need.What ordinary people most want, presumably, is a share in that sweet asset inflation that wealthy art collectors and stock investors enjoy. One strategy for achieving that may lie with  a brand new digital asset class, one that barely existed during the previous crisis but which now stands alongside rare art, gold and stocks as a potential beneficiary of the Fed’s unlimited stimulus spending. I’m talking, of course, about cryptocurrencies and, in particular, bitcoin. Some of the logic behind demand for 19th century expressionist classics at times like this could apply to bitcoin. A key, but not only, reason why the price of rare works of art rises in crises – as well as Manhattan real estate, exclusive yachts, and stocks subject to company buybacks – is because, relative to the ever-increasing supply of stimulus dollars in financial asset owners’ bank accounts, these things are scarce. They have a measurably finite supply. It’s the luxury lifestyle version of Venezuelans dumping unwanted bolivars in return for cans of soup.Now, for the first time, we have digital scarcity – assets whose supply cannot be randomly increased by someone who controls them even though they exist within the cut-and-paste world of the internet. Scarcity is the real problem that bitcoin solves. In fact, as odd as it might sound in a capitalist society that equates value with productive utility, bitcoin’s core value proposition is really just that it is provably scarce. Next week’s anticipated halving in bitcoin’s issuance rate, an event no one can stop, reinforces this idea of provable, measurable scarcity. As investment firm Grayscale, a unit of New York-based Digital Currency Group, CoinDesk's parent company, puts it, bitcoin is undergoing “quantitative tightening” while central banks are doing “quantitative easing.”Early Friday morning UTC, this new store-of-value asset, described by many as “digital gold,” jumped over $10,000 for the first time in two and a half months, though it couldn’t surpass the 2020 high of $10,598 from mid-February. (Notably, prices for physical gold, the world’s traditional scarce-supply safe haven, have regained all their lost ground and are now pushing toward the record highs they reached in 2011.) Either way, bitcoin’s strong gains through April and early May have revived the conversation around why, in this digital era, an asset of this kind holds value. Bitcoin’s mathematically determined scarcity offers a direct counterpoint to the unbounded QE issuance of fiat currency, whose numbers are now so huge, writes Bloomberg’s Jared Dillian, that money is losing its meaning. And while there are forks of bitcoin that seek to compete with it, the oldest cryptocurrency’s two-third stake of all crypto market cap gives it, much like gold, a cultural status as the digital store of value.Hugely influential hedge manager Paul Tudor Jones II seems to get the now. But you know what, unlike buying a Munch painting, you don’t need to be as rich as a hedge fund titan and be on an auctioneer’s privileged bidder list to buy bitcoin.Speaking of how the Fed is quantitatively easing while bitcoin is quantitatively tightening, check out this chart. Under its unlimited, unending asset-buying program – sometimes dubbed “QE Infinity,” the Fed is essentially buying everything its mandate allows it to buy. Between Feb. 26 and April 29, it has added an unprecedented $2.5 trillion to its balance sheet of bonds and other securities. For comparison, the previous most aggressive expansion period, between Sept. 10 and Nov. 12, 2008, when the Fed was backstopping banks and dealing with the swirling fallout from Lehman Brothers’ collapse, it added $1.3 trillion to its balance sheet. The scale now is mind-boggling. There are signs of surging African interest in bitcoin. In this tweet thread, data scientist Matt Ahlborg uses interactive charts from Useful Tulips, the data visualization site he founded, to highlight sharp recent gains in the value of daily SubSaharan African  transactions on peer-to-peer exchanges LocalBitcoins and Paxful. Volumes on those sites – which allow people to exchange bitcoin for fiat currencies directly with each other – reached a record dollar-equivalent volume  exceeding $10 million on May 3. Part of that reflects the higher bitcoin price, but the extent and multi-country breadth of the move hints at bigger factors than market impact. Ahlborg declared, “Africa may have already taken over Latin America as the epicenter of utility Bitcoin usage globally. If you aren't paying attention to this market, you are WRONG!”CoinDesk columnist John Paul Koning suggested Ahlborg’s definition of “utility” could be a stretch, as it might include normal speculation, scams and fraud. Even so, something is making Africans, across multiple countries, trade more bitcoin. Is this crisis related? A response to dollar shortages? I’m inclined to agree with Ahlborg on this: pay attention to Africa.COVID-19 economic stimulus measures have varied greatly worldwide. Much like public health policy, they have been hastily delivered on a go-on-your-own-way basis because there simply was not time to coordinate internationally. (National coordination was hard enough.) The upside of all this is that in a year or so’s time, economists will have a nice pool of comparative data to measure what works and what doesn’t. When they get around to that, the COVID-19 Economic Stimulus Index developed by Ceyhun Elgin, Gokce Basbug and Abdullah Yalaman, could prove pretty useful. The three economists rapidly pulled together an analysis of 166 countries to produce a database of measures that cover six variables under three categories: fiscal policy, monetary policy, and balance of payment/exchange rate policy. After a barrage of regulator criticism upon its launch last year, Libra’s leaders vowed to take note. It’s now clear they listened. After last month shifting the corporate consortium’s digital currency model away from its controversial basket-pegged system to one of single-currency stablecoins, Libra this week announced the appointment of a CEO with a resume that’s hard to beat if you need someone who can talk the talk with regulators. Before his appointment, Stuart Levey was Chief Legal Officer at HSBC, which had hired him explicitly to clean up the mess left by its massive money laundering scandal, for which it ended up paying a $1.9 billion fine. It’s pretty clear why HSBC had hired Levey: his previous job was as Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence under both the Bush and Obama presidencies. Libra knows where its biggest battles lie.Correction 5/10/20 1:40 p.m. UTC: This piece originally misspelled the name of the founder of Useful Tulips.

16,www.coindesk.com,,How Leading Crypto Traders Make Money (and Retain Sanity) - CoinDesk,https://www.coindesk.com/the-men-who-stare-at-charts,"Charts tracking the price of bitcoin dominate six buzzing monitors in the

of ...","May 8, 2020 at 12:15 UTC","Charts tracking the price of bitcoin dominate six buzzing monitors in the third-floor office of a rotting, centuries-old tower block in the heart of Kiev. A pattern emerges among the shifting forms and shapes, and Brian – a 33-year-old trader who asks we use only his first name – reacts swiftly, punching his extemporaneous analysis into a chatbox on the messenger app Telegram. He has identified the distinctive downward twist of a “falling wedge formation.” To those in the know, that means: The price is going down at a diminishing rate, and should presently head moooooonwards.","A succinct bulletin summarizing this prognosis flashes on the cellphone screens of the roughly 300 traders in Brian’s VIP-only cryptocurrency trading group, “WhaleTank.” Each of these members is paying big bucks to hear Brian’s informed, round-the-clock insights and – quite literally – follow his every move. For the knockout price of 0.1 percent of a bitcoin per month (roughly $90, at time of writing), WhaleTank’s members are able to program their algorithm-enhanced ""trading bots"" to copy Brian’s trades, riding in the slipstream of each rollicking Fibonacci curve. He is the rising tide that lifts all boats ... or, if he messes up, the whirlpool that pulls them under.Mercifully, he is a “very good trader,” says one follower known only as “Adrenalin.”Brian belongs to an underground, largely anonymous collective of high-octane cryptocurrency traders who seek their fortunes in the scantily regulated – and heavily manipulated – crypto markets. While large funds dominate the broader sweeps in bitcoin’s price, thousands, if not millions, of traders exist at the fringes, working from Miami beach townhouses, grim Glaswegian bedsits, tricked-out studios in Kiev, a world apart from Wall Street. Instead of holding the asset long-term and praying for a windfall, they trade the twists and turns, profiting when it goes up and profiting when it goes down. If you’re a talented trader, why bother with an investment bank or a hedge fund or even a crypto hedge fund, when you can trade 100X leverage (read: very dangerous) on BitMEX, and get all of your trading tips from Discord? The normal rules do not apply in the world of cryptocurrency. In the stock market, traders make predictions by peering into “fundamentals,” the reality behind a company’s valuation. They can check the news, call up the CEO, sleep with the intern. You can’t do that with bitcoin, or the embarrassingly unregulated “altcoin” markets, where useless money-grabs with names like “morguecoin” are minted ad infinitum. The controversial belief among many traders is that price movements in these markets rarely conceal a deeper reality – they reveal only the frantic movements of the traders themselves. “Nobody can look at the P and L of ‘The Bitcoin Company,’” says Scott Melker, a 43-year-old DJ turned trader who goes by the name “Wolf of all Streets” on Twitter, where he has more than 70,000 followers. Cryptocurrencies go up and down because people buy them and sell them, he says. And why do people buy them and sell them? Because other people buy them and sell them. “It’s the ultimate self-fulfilling prophecy,” he says. Reduced to raw numerical data, that wild rondelay of buying and selling begins to form predictable patterns, which can be understood through “technical analysis” – or TA, the practice of reading charts. Melker is an avid fan: every evening, after a day of comparatively normal life – doing the rounds on the cryptocurrency conference circuit (now largely relegated to Zoom), writing newsletter entries, shitposting on Twitter, relaxing with his children – he will pull up a chart on his computer and begin to search for patterns, specifically those which alert him to the “visitation of human emotions on traders – where are they going to be greedy, where the smart money is going to prey on their fear.” It could be any old coin, he doesn’t care. “They could be curing cancer or I could be trading stuff that could be giving cigarettes to children in Africa,” he laughs. “I wouldn’t know.”Traders exist at the fringes, working from Miami beach townhouses, grim Glaswegian bedsits, tricked-out studios in Kiev, a world apart from Wall Street.He’ll look through Discord, Twitter, Reddit, hunting for signals. If you’ve spent time on “Crypto Twitter,” you’ll have seen the sort of stuff he trawls through each day. Frenetically superimposed scrawlings on charts bearing names that sound like military tactics: “moving wedge formation,” “double top,” “cup and handle formation.” Maybe the odd parody formation, like “vomiting camel.”When he spies an opportunity – let’s say “Thorecoin” is eyeing a bullish increase past its $0.00034 support price – he’ll plan a trade and set an alarm. Sometimes he’ll take a chart’s predictions at face value, if he trusts the source. But he’s not normally one for the astrological stuff. (“The pattern doesn’t work because it’s the ‘natural flow of nature,’” he says. “Those patterns work because everyone is watching them.”) Most likely, he’ll engage in a sort of meta-play: making predictions based on the credulity of those who do believe TA speaks to some sort of ineffable cosmic principle. If everyone’s watching the same line on a chart, he says, “It becomes a thing, and the price breaks out, and you go, ‘Oh my God! Technical analysis works so well.’”If he’s lucky, he’ll then cash out – in USD. “My interest isn’t to have tens of millions of dollars worth of bitcoin,” says Melker, who believes in the technology’s promise but is hardly an evangelist. “I have to sell my bitcoins for actual dollars. A lot of people think they’re professional traders but they’re not taking profits in dollars. The most essential part of being a trader is, you have to ring the cash register, you know?”_____Melker, trading only ten minutes a day as he does, lives life a little more fully than certain other traders. Consider the case of “Young Tilopa,” a pseudonymous trader based in Glasgow, who, every day, rises at 7 a.m., showers, walks his dog, slams down a coffee, pulls up an app called “Sierra Charts” and proceeds to gaze unblinkingly at charts for pretty much the rest of the day, doing very little else. Most of the charts are black or dull grey, streaked through with wild white zig-zags that pulse arrhythmically, like blips on a heartbeat monitor. “It’s kind of a lame profession,” he says, noting that many of his fellow traders are single, fairly lonely males in their twenties and thirties. (Many of them are students enrolled in his trading course, one of his few respites from ... trading.) Traders are often super smart and razor sharp, he says, but in that tragicomic internet way – their jokes belie the essential bleakness of their lives. “Essentially, you’re an independent trader sitting in your room all day, staring at charts, and sometimes you think, ‘What the f--- am I doing?’” he says. “It’s sometimes meaningless – you’re not interacting with anyone.” (COVID-19, as you can imagine, has not made much of a difference.)Named after an 11th century Buddhist monk, Tilopa takes a singularly Zen-like approach to trading. He analyses “technical events,” market shifts determined by idiosyncrasies in trading platforms (that is, exchanges). Unlike other traders he doesn’t merely predict: He seeks to understand  “market microstructure, how the market moves,” he says. The atomic, subatomic order of things. Suppose you’re trying to figure out whether a car will stall: it’s the difference between observing the actions of the driver – a flashing indicator; a rightward pull on the wheel; a foot on the accelerator – and checking the engine. For years, Tilopa did exactly that, inhaling volumes of academic papers on market dynamics. One of his favorite “technical events” to exploit involves a “stop loss.” When a trader activates a stop loss, he is effectively saying to the exchange, “Hey, if the price dips below X, sell all my holdings! I’d sure prefer to not be wiped out if the market craters!” It is a purely technical thing – a command to an algorithm. But the use of stop-losses, says Tilopa, betrays a certain amount of greed: in a time of cautious optimism, traders hungry for profits will edge their stop-losses lower and lower, as if playing chicken with themselves … and then, if it’s their unlucky day and the markets lurch into freefall, the stop-losses will trigger and their worldly assets will be sold off. Whereas Tilopa merely surfs the riptides churned up in the wake of these movements, “whales” lurk in the deep, making tremors. They are immensely wealthy, capricious, and anonymous. They have accrued such a large share of the market that they can effectively bend it to their will. Word is, many of them exist in a criminal underworld, and use a dollar-denominated cryptocurrency called “Tether” because they cannot access real dollars. And they prey on the weak. Spying a large gathering of stop-losses, for instance, a whale may deliberately crash the market below the stop-losses’ threshold – profiting from the ensuing rout. This move is known as the “stop-loss hunt.” Predatory indeed.With whales at large, traders are advised to remain vigil. Joe McCann, a Microsoft strategist who moonlights as a cryptocurrency trader, knows that letting his guard down could cost him. By way of defense, he has designed and coded a labyrinthine, fully automated risk management system, which “monitors my positions off-exchange,” he says. “If my account ever gets blown up, then it's 100% my fault.” ALSO FROM CONSENSUS MAGAZINE 2020:The CoinDesk 50, by CoinDesk staffCrypto in Corona: From Switzerland to Liberland, by Jeff WilserMichelle Phan: The Beauty of Bitcoin, by Leigh CuenThe Changemaker: Glen Weyl Puts His Radical Ideas Into Action, by Jeff WilserThe Man Who Saw a Currency Cold War, by Jeff WilserGeneration Crypto by Jessica KleinIn cryptocurrency trading more generally, discipline is key. “The best way to know what techniques to use is to patiently study your character, emotions and ways of thinking,” says the Venezuela-based Luis J. Sarmiento, the 23-year-old co-founder of AltSignals, a Telegram trading group which charges $107 per month to its over 40,000 members. Sarmiento claims to have generated profits of 529 percent since early 2018, and learned The Way from an old hand who, once training was over, simply vanished into thin air, like Yoda. (“I met my trading master in a forum in 2016,” he said. “I never knew his name. And in 2017, he simply did not reconnect to the chat.”) I met my trading master in a forum in 2016. I never knew his name. And in 2017, he simply did not reconnect to the chat.For the few who are sufficiently disciplined/lucky – an increasingly small number of people, as traders point out – the sheer weirdness of the cryptocurrency markets can also make for a thrilling, if financially lethal, day-to-day. Traders speak especially fondly of what they call “crypto native” opportunities, trades that would be impossible in the mainstream financial markets. McCann, for instance, is intrigued by cryptocurrency-based “flash loans” which are instantly originated and repaid. A confident enough trader can conceivably take one out, trade it to profit, then immediately pay it back with no loss incurred. Such a thing is inconceivable in the mainstream financial markets.Picture it: You borrow, say, $1 million from Wells Fargo. You blow it all on the stock market and then, somehow – in the space of mere milliseconds – you’re able to generate enough money to pay it all back, and keep a massive surplus. Impossible. Yet, in crypto, a trader actually pulled this off, sucking $350,000 from decentralized exchange “BZX,” in a matter of seconds. The wildest part? Had the trade fallen flat, the loan would have never happened. The blockchain just ... wouldn’t have recorded it.“There’s really no real-world analog” to flash loans, notes Nic Carter, a partner at Castle Island Ventures. “Which is maybe why people are so fascinated by them.”While cryptocurrency trading is a risky business, to some it’s simply … business. Clad in a crisp, white shirt and creaseless trousers, Brian rocks up to a literal office every day, in Kiev. Working around the clock with his fleet of analysts, he makes use of complicated statistical models built up from a variety of sources: historical data, arcane predictive “indicators,” tabs kept on rival traders. (Even second-rate traders can offer valuable “counter-signals,” he says. “Those who want to be as accurate as possible must take every single factor into account, and analyze every single indicator.”)The walls of the office are yellowing and worn; a six-screened, 3.60 gigahertz hydra of a computer stares the traders down, flashing with to-the-nanosecond updates. Harvesting as much raw data as exists on this material plane is Brian’s secret sauce, and he boasts of an astonishing prediction rate, of well over 90 percent. “Our price predictions are not only correct, but accurate to the dollar,” he says. His analysis “goes much deeper than your everyday trader – we go way back in time into the chart, years, decades.”Read more: Bitcoin Halving, ExplainedThe highs are high, the lows are low. Brian recalls a bumper week in which he turned $15,000 worth of Bitcoin into $60,000. “I nailed every single trade that week,” he recalls. (Although, he adds, he “managed to lose it all months after.”) Sometimes it doesn’t quite pan out. Once he let $200,000 shrink to $30,000 in a matter of days, although this, he explains, was well before bitcoin’s legendary hockey-stick swerve to $20,000 in 2017, when people mostly bought and held the asset. That left them at the mercy of market forces, he says. “We were just holding bitcoin as believers – I wasn't as immune as I am today.” (Although the record shows that people were doing bitcoin technical analysis at least as early as 2011.) Now, Brian plays the market – obsessively. Although he is operating his business at a 100% loss (roughly $10,000 a month in revenue, $20,000 in expenses, much of it on marketing), he trades as close to 24/7 as humanly possible. Passion propels him – and unlike in traditional stocks, the markets never close. “To get such good results, you must be in love with the asset and follow it through 24/7,” he says. “Bitcoin is something many have fallen in love with, and they open the bitcoin chart every 10 minutes. You won't ever see something like that with the traditional stocks.” Currently, Brian is working on an uber complex trade relating to the breathlessly anticipated May 11 “halving” event. That event, which will see the supply of new Bitcoin’s precipitously drop, is expected (well, hoped) to cause a huge surge in demand, and a long-term price boost thereafter. Believers support their conviction by drawing on elaborate theories of supply and demand, and point out that similar rallies have followed previous halvings. And it’s looking pretty hopeful: Bitcoin’s price has been climbing steadily over the past few days, as if excitement is steadily mounting...Brian, regrettably, has looked at the charts and arrived at a very different conclusion. It’ll probably be a case of “buy the rumor, sell the news,” he imagines: a brief, self-fulfilling frenzy – caused by people buying into what they think will be a fundamentals-driven rally – followed by a quick plummet as the winners cash out. Not only does the data on previous halvings support this, he says (at 3 a.m. on a Wednesday), but the patterns on the charts tracking Bitcoin’s current, prodigious rise don’t bode well either. He delivers to me his jargon-larded, fully incomprehensible prognosis. “I got bearish divergences on 4H charts, overbought on the 1D chart … And the ichimoku cloud is only going to give us that bullish cross once the price corrects itself, and it breaks out of the cloud … Therefore I can say we are to correct ourselves, most likely to 0.3fib…”To translate: Brian is referring to two different timeframes on the chart, one which staggers the price movements into four-hour batches (4H) and another which staggers them into one-day batches (1D). Each of these timeframes gives a different sense of the trajectory: The 4H timeframe displays a “bearish divergence,” evidence that the price rally isn’t going as well as expected, and could be in for a prompt “reversal.” The 1D timeframe signals that the rate at which the price is increasing is actually too fast compared with historically successful rallies. That’s what “overbought” means: a surfeit of people have bought in, and the uptick may not last long.After parsing these signals, Brian plotted the two lines together and colored in the shape subsequently formed. If the price trends below that shape – known as the “Ichimoku cloud,” after the Japanese journalist who invented it in the 1930s – he expects any emerging “bullish” trend to be short-lived. Which, unfortunately, is the case now. But crucially, he also has a hunch that for this halving, the fundamentals are stronger than usual – that is, the real-life changes behind the price movements are tangible enough that mere chart-reading could be insufficient. For once, Bitcoin is subject to a readily visible, quantifiable change in its supply. That has caused Brian’s predictions to falter more often than usual in the past few weeks, implying external forces are at play. This all goes to show how TA is far from infallible. Traders acknowledge the discipline is better understood as a “risk management tool,” a way to avert the more dramatic losses. And treating chart-reading as an exact science, in general, is controversial. “Hard” scientists stress an epistemic distinction between the financial models that crypto traders employ and those employed by physicists or chemists. That latter group builds predictions based on carefully controlled models intended to approximate the structure of reality. TA advocates, by contrast, can only use “pure induction,” assumptions based on past trends whose future results cannot be guaranteed: Just because a well-placed Golden Cross formation resulted in an “upside rally” the last twelve times doesn’t mean it’ll happen again. It’s like driving your car “using only the rear-view mirror,” as one person put it on Reddit. Writer and former options trader Nassem Taleb, in his book “Fooled by Randomness,” argued that people who use TA are in thrall to the vicious, circular logic of “survivorship bias”: they declare it useful because it works for them. And those for whom it doesn’t work? They’re not doing it properly! Alas, it comes as a mighty shock when they, too, wind up destitute. Writes Taleb, “Option sellers, it is said, eat like chickens and go to the bathroom like elephants” – tiny gains, immense, ruinous losses. Similarly, Brian notes the prevalence of  “confirmation bias” among traders. “It’s easy to find both bearish and bullish signals in the charts, and traders often choose whichever aligns with their emotions,” he says.Worse, through the very process of trading, crypto traders often end up disrupting the very systems they are trying to observe. Their own interventions – unlike those of scientists – can’t be controlled, and they ripple out into a chaotic system that responds to the very act of trying to predict them. How can you predict a thing that’s being manipulated before your very eyes?These are criticisms that largely ricochet off the thick skins of cryptocurrency traders; indeed, there is a broad recognition that although these diagnoses are legitimate, they are hardly terminal. As with much in the cryptocurrency world, the very elements of cryptocurrency trading that make it so attractive to speculators – wild volatility, theoretically unsound underlying principles – also make it attractive to the ethically challenged. Melker gives an example of a particular fraud he’s observed, endemic to paid Telegram groups. “There are players who literally draw the charts with their orders,” he says. “A [Telegram group] leader would be like, ‘I’m watching this coin, it’s about to break out.’ And then it breaks out – because he bought it.”“It’s guaranteed money, every single time.”The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

","For daily insights and unique perspectives listen or subscribe to the CoinDesk Podcast Network with Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Pocketcasts, Google Podcasts, Castbox, Stitcher, RadioPublica, IHeartRadio or RSS. This episode is sponsored by ErisX, The Stellar Development Foundation and Grayscale Digital Large Cap Investment Fund.“There is really very little difference, at least in the point of origin...whether something is a scam,” Byrne said, regarding inaccurate blogs and representations of software projects. “Take Ethereum, for example. Ethereum had all manner of promises that were made...the statements coming from the Ethereum Foundation were somewhat more measured.” Regardless of whether any particular project is an attempt at fraud, it’s likely that online money schemes of every variety will become more common during this coronavirus crisis. According to Thomas Papageorge, head of the Consumer Protection Unit at the San Diego District Attorney’s office, there’s a “clear pattern” of more white-collar crimes since the recession began. “The rate of incidents, the amount of fraud, does increase dramatically during an emergency situation like this,” Papageorge said. “I’ve heard about new types of scams that involve cryptocurrency … investment scams and bogus advice about protecting your savings or bitcoin.”Bitcoin evangelist Andreas Antonopoulos tweeted that fraudsters were impersonating him to offer unemployed people fake jobs, identity thieves looking for personal information. Likewise, CoinDesk impersonators are also targeting people across the sector.See also: Why the Dollar Has Never Been Stronger or More Set Up to FailAccording to Carnegie Mellon University economics professor Sevin Yeltekin, the financial stressors people are experiencing today make them “more vulnerable to those scams.” However, there is a silver lining, she said, because businesses that survive the current recession will do so because they reimagined how they operate, including “risk management.”Even tech-savvy people like Lisa Gus, startup investment lead at the Government Blockchain Association and co-founder of the startup WishKnish, can be vulnerable to fraudsters in such stressful times. Gus said she spent several weeks being led on by a scammer impersonating a Binance employee before her startup’s security solution MetaCert identified a phishing domain behind the fraudster’s email account, support@communitybinance.org. “About LinkedIn, I’m not the only one being inundated with fake [investment] offers...the amount of propositions I’ve been getting [is up],” Gus said. “Especially for larger companies, it’s impossible to track profiles that are associated with them.”With regards to this instance, a LinkedIn spokesperson recommended members “take precautions” in these trying times and “report any messages or postings they believe are scams to us so we can investigate.""Larger companies often charge early-stage blockchain projects for working together, whether it’s cited as marketing costs or listing fees. In Gus’ case, the fraudster had due diligence paperwork and non-disclosure contracts, which made the scammer’s request for a bitcoin deposit less suspicious. As for retail users, ShapeShift CEO Erik Voorhees has “definitely seen more phishing attempts” since early March. Likewise, a Binance spokesperson said so far in 2020 the company saw an average of 180 scam reports per month, which dwarf the unreported instances. So the exchange offers a public verification tool to check whether websites, phone numbers, emails, Telegram and WeChat handles are actually affiliated with Binance. That’s why the blockchain explorer Etherscan launched the “EthProtect” program in April, to tag wallet addresses reportedly used for fraud. Etherscan CEO Matthew Tan said the company uses internal “circuit breakers” to minimize false positives and aims to provide users with “actionable data” to make “informed choices” about who they transact with. See also: Udi Wertheimer on Cypherpunk Myths and Bitcoin in Real LifeAs for the attorney Byrne, he said in some cases cryptocurrency projects may run afoul of consumer protection issues, even if they are not considered unregistered securities, frauds or scams. “There’s a range of representations of things, what you can say about things, that aren’t necessarily true but aren’t fraudulent,” he said. The fact is, cryptocurrency now exists. People will use it unethically, the same way they do with all other forms of money. But there are lawful and constructive ways to use the technology as well. “You can operate a bitcoin business in a regulatory compliant fashion,” Byrne said. “However, it requires a lot of work and advice and design to do that correctly.”Want more?

19,www.coindesk.com,,"Meet Brian Klein, Crypto's Own 'High-Stakes' Trial Attorney - CoinDesk",https://www.coindesk.com/meet-brian-klein-cryptos-own-high-stakes-trial-attorney,"Several of his former clients described him as a friendly, personable 
attorney. Two of them, noted bitcoin entrepreneur Shrem and Hutchins ( ...","May 10, 2020 at 15:00 UTC",Call him the David Boies of crypto.,"Brian Klein may not be a household name in the blockchain space, but several of his clients – Erik Voorhees, Charlie Shrem and Block.one, to name a few – certainly are. The self-described “high-stakes trial attorney” has exploded onto the scene in recent years as a successful defender in numerous civil and criminal cases in the technology and cryptocurrency worlds.He’s now representing Virgil Griffith, the Ethereum developer and former Ethereum Foundation head of special projects accused by the U.S. government of traveling to North Korea to speak at a conference and discuss sanctions evasion using cryptocurrency. In January, Griffith confidently entered an “innocent” plea before a district judge, kicking off the months-long, multi-step discovery and eventual trial process which Klein hopes will lead to an acquittal. CoinDesk met with Klein in mid-December, partly in the hopes that he would chat about this case but largely to get a sense of the attorney whose name kept popping up on the radar. Perhaps unsurprisingly, he declined to comment about Griffith’s case beyond previous statements declaring his belief that his client would be exonerated. Dressed in a plaid shirt and gray jacket, he shared his insights on litigating in the fintech space, working with entrepreneurs and crypto overall.“It’s very enjoyable representing entrepreneurs and founders, they’re the people really building the industry,” Klein said of crypto, a space where he’s worked since 2013. “I think a lot of people in this space feel a lot of camaraderie with each other even though it's a competitive space and that makes the industry a lot of fun to work for,” he said. “There’s no reason you can’t have lots of digital currencies, lots of tokens out there. I think it’s vindication.”Klein began his legal career at the New York University School of Law, has lived on both the East and West coasts of the U.S. and is now a partner at Baker Marquart LLP. In his past, he’s worked at Wilson Sonsini Goodrich and Rosati, Skadden Arps, Brafman & Associates and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Central District of California.He had the option of continuing to work at large law firms but chose to join Baker Marquart, a small, Los Angeles-based law firm boasting fewer than 20 trial lawyers on its website, said Klein, who will speak Monday at Consensus: Distributed.“I wanted to represent [both] individuals and companies and it’s really hard to do both at big law firms because of conflicts,” he explained. He joined Baker Marquart in 2012 and entered the crypto space a year later after reading guidance from the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) and writing an article on the subject. “I’m a libertarian by nature and I have a lot of issues with how big finance is [treated] globally, and in our country, and it leaves a lot of people outside looking in,” he said, referring to un- and underbanked individuals unable to access the modern financial system.See also: USA v. Virgil Griffith: What We Know (and Don’t) in the Bombshell Crypto Sanctions CaseWhile Klein’s record is prominent, his peers were downright effusive. David Silver, a prominent litigator in the crypto space in his own right, told CoinDesk that Klein provides “the best representation possible by the best lawyer available.”“I only hope I never need his counsel, but if I did I would hire him in a second,” he said. Likewise, Compound Finance General Counsel Jake Chervinsky told CoinDesk that Klein is “one of the best defense attorneys in the crypto industry.” Marcia Hoffman, who joined Klein in representing cybersecurity researcher Marcus Hutchins, told CoinDesk Klein’s first reaction to a new case is to determine “how do we get a handle on what’s happening.”“He will just come right in and immediately is thinking about ‘how do we get this situation under control,’ ‘how do we put ourselves in the best position moving forward,’ which can be really stressful,” she said.Over a breakfast of oatmeal, fruit and a bagel at a downtown Manhattan hotel – and later, during a hearing – Klein maintained a soft-spoken tone but projected confidence in his past work and future efforts. Several of his former clients described him as a friendly, personable attorney. Two of them, noted bitcoin entrepreneur Shrem and Hutchins (otherwise known as MalwareTech, one of the researchers who halted the WannaCry ransomware attack in 2017), both said Klein spoke to them as friends outside their legal cases. “I still talk to him very frequently just about life in general,” Shrem told CoinDesk.His personable manner was on display during Griffith’s arraignment. Prior to the hearing’s start, Klein appeared to be reassuring his client while sorting the case’s projected timeline.“It’s okay,” Klein told Griffith after sidebarring with the assistant U.S. attorneys prosecuting the case. Then the two men sat down and began a protracted, whispered conversation. As a lawyer, Klein “managed expectations very well,” Shrem said, referring to the expectations Klein set for his case and how he predicted certain options would play out. As a client, Shrem said he never felt like he’d lost control of his case. Among other details, he praised Klein’s management style, saying Klein coordinated his team of attorneys to minimize the costs to Shrem during a case against Winklevoss Capital Management, the family office started by Gemini founders Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss.See also: Freedom Fighter or Fool? Jury’s Out on Arrested Ethereum Developer Virgil GriffithKlein said he’s available 24/7 for his clients, and while “it’s sometimes disruptive to your personal life,” he’s found it’s helped him overall.Hutchins said Klein had checked in during holidays and invited him to several events during his time in the U.S. (A U.K. resident, Hutchins was unable to leave the U.S. during his case.)“My impression is that he's a great lawyer but also a kind person. He took my case pro-bono because I didn't have the money to afford legal counsel,” Hutchins said. “I've also seen him go out of his way to help out people in similar situations.”Still, his friendliness doesn’t stop Klein from winning his high-profile cases. Hutchins was sentenced to supervised release and the judge in his case advocated for a full pardon; Shrem won $45,000 in legal fees after settling the Winklevoss’s case against him (the twins’ lawyer was fined $15,000 for “improper behavior” during the case); and Block.One agreed to pay $24 million in a settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, with the agency granting a waiver essentially ensuring the EOS token is not deemed a security. Klein told CoinDesk he’s bullish over the long term about cryptocurrencies, citing bitcoin’s status as a form of digital money not controlled by any government or single, centralized entity.Still, he said, “I think there’s a lot of work to do here.”The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

American users, collateralized by bitcoin. Mauricio Di Bartolomeo is a ...","May 10, 2020 at 13:06 UTC","MakerDAO is the Godzilla of DeFi, a decentralized beast born of Vitalik's nuclear bomb: Ethereum.","At $350+ million in crypto locked into MakerDAO's smart contracts, it dominates the chief use case of the second-biggest blockchain. Like the celluloid firebreather before it, other similar beasts followed. The most well known are companies like Compound, Synthetix and dy/dx, making them equivalent to moviedom's Mothras, Rodans and Gameras. Gojira and his ilk are known as kaiju, and DeFi is crypto's equivalent.  In both the films and on the blockchains, regular denizens cannot look away, as each illustrates a grand potential but leaving the occasional inadvertent destruction in their wake. Both kinds of kaiju are weird, big and disruptive, and each can have only one King of Monsters.This post is part of the CoinDesk 50, an annual selection of the most innovative and consequential projects in the blockchain industry. See the full list here.On Ethereum, it all started with MakerDAO, a protocol that turns anyone's ether (ETH), USDC or BAT holdings into loans of a dollar-pegged stablecoin minted for this purpose: dai. This is Maker's magical idea. The money lent did not exist before the loan was made. It manifests the credit theory of money explicitly. And people actually use it.Maker was founded in 2015 by Rune Christensen of Denmark, where the MakerDAO Foundation is largely (but not entirely) based. Christensen was motivated to make a cryptocurrency without price volatility. He and his cohorts came up with dai, and unlike most stablecoins, which are backed by fiat deposited in a bank, dai is backed by trustlessly staked cryptocurrency. Each dai token is worth $1 because that's the value the smart contracts enforce, primarily by collateralization rules.Not satisfied with letting adoption of dai play out as it will, however, the team has invested in building up networks in specific parts of the world. That's what convinced a Canadian startup to begin lending dai to its Latin American users, collateralized by bitcoin.Mauricio Di Bartolomeo is a Ledn co-founder and a native of Venezuela. He always wanted his company to serve Latin America, and he first encountered MakerDAO on a trip through the region to spread the word about Ledn's bitcoin-collateralized lending project. He was surprised to find the Maker Foundation already there educating would-be crypto users about MakerDAO and dai.""What really came to light in that experience was how hard they were working in the region,"" he said. ""With the community came the liquidity around dai.""Ledn started surveying potential users to see what sort of asset they would like to borrow against bitcoin. They got a very strong response for dai as an option, Di Bartolomeo said. Some users wanted to participate in DeFi. Some just didn't have bank accounts. In either case, dai was the cryptocurrency they knew, so that's what they wanted. Di Bartolomeo credited old fashioned community building to the local adoption.Still another Latin American entrepreneur we spoke to had a compelling vision for making his product essentially free to crypto users with dai, but it didn't fly.Matias Nisenson of Argentinian game company Elemental wanted to let users stake dai to play rather than pay. Elemental created the game CryptoWars that used to be a gigantic, multiplayer resource management game (it's pivoting now). The idea was going to be that players could put up some dai, Elemental would deposit it on Compound and keep the interest in exchange for letting its owners play, but players could still get their dai back any time.The game had managed to mainly cultivate a user base out of ETH holders, people who could take advantage of the tournament prizes they offered each weekend. Still, Nisenson said, it was ""too much of an investment for a user to just play a game. Too heavy."" Even if it meant they got to play the game essentially for free.It was a good deal, but players didn't think giving up ETH's upside was worth it.Like Godzilla himself, who came to function as humanity's protector, strange giants always unsettle mere mortals. After all, both tend to crush some underfoot on occasion, despite good intentions. People on the internet are still getting accustomed to DeFi's weird and surprising titan, no matter what its potential might be.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Kostecki originally planned Massive Adoption for November 2019, but ...","May 8, 2020 at 09:00 UTC","The organizer of the canceled Massive Adoption crypto conference, which boasted a potential audience of 1,500, is being sued over allegations that ticket refunds are too slow.","The putative class action lawsuit was filed Thursday in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado by Ashley Gentry, a would-be attendee of Massive Adoption, and alleges fraud, breach of contract, conversion and unjust enrichment. The suit is calling for the organizer, Jacob Kostecki, to refund would-be attendees, as well as punitive damages and the costs of the lawsuit. David Silver, the attorney who filed the lawsuit, told CoinDesk he was doing so pro bono, and would not be accepting payment or fees for the case.Silver has long been active in the crypto space, and has filed suit against Cryptsy, BitConnect, YouTube and the Tezos Foundation in the past. Crypto exchange Coinbase participated in a settlement connected to the Cryptsy case.Also read: I Attended a Bitcoin Conference in VR and Still Got SickKostecki originally planned Massive Adoption for November 2019, but rescheduled to late February 2020. He canceled the event by the end of January 2020, however, and promised refunds to customers. An update on his website said he had ""inadequate funding,"" and fewer guests and sponsors than he needed to maintain the event. A later update on his website, which went down for some time between February 2020 and late April, said, ""Due to a series of local conditions, global markets, operator errors and mistakes the conference was cancelled late January.""Kostecki said in the update he had begun processing refunds in March, and would continue through July 2020. A countdown clock on the updated site appears to be counting down to Friday, July 31, 2020. Kostecki did not immediately return a request for comment. Silver told CoinDesk via email that, ""we approached Mr. Kostecki several weeks ago with a simple offer to resolve the debts he has already acknowledged he owes to the would-be Massive Adoption attendees.""In April 2020, Silver tweeted that he would work with any attendees owed under $1,000 for free to ensure refunds. At the time, Kostecki responded, ""If you believe that this will accelerate the relief to ticket holders instead of hinder it then that is your decision.""Kostecki declined the offer, Silver said. In the new update to his website, Kostecki said ""the reaction to Covid-19 has delayed refunds vs internal milestones,"" a claim he has also previously made on Twitter.See also: Coronavirus Concerns Cause Another Crypto Event to Be PostponedIn his most recent tweet, dated April 26, on an account dedicated to Massive Adoption, Kostecki said, ""Refunds continue being made,"" and that he had been in touch with ""dozens of people"" over the past two months. He maintained that he would meet his July 31 deadline.The lawsuit is being filed as a putative class action because some of the would-be attendees have small claims, and may not be able to file individual lawsuits, Thursday's filing claimed.""We are still willing to work with Mr. Kostecki on formulating a quick and simple resolution, but the fact that we filed the lawsuit shows that Mr. Kostecki’s hollow Twitter promises are not enough,"" Silver said.Read the full complaint below:The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Standardization of money came relatively late to the world. One of the lessons of history is that with globalization comes a tendency for a particular currency to become the number one dominant currency for transactions, for trade, for international reserves. A great question to ask is: globalization enters this phase of crisis: will there be some other transition from the dollar to another currency? Or could we see a reversion to a multipolar, multi currency world?” On the first episode of Money Reimagined, we looked at the strange paradox of the U.S. dollar. On the one hand, massive stimulus fueled by ""money printer go brrr"" should suggest for inflation. At the same time, however, there is no denying the dollar is stronger than ever, rising in value compared to other currencies in spite of that inflation potential. There is a sense among many, however, that this strength is relative, temporary and, above all, unsustainable. In a world where a global dollar-based monetary system does not serve the interest of the world, what replaces it? This episode is about the sovereign contenders - in other words, the currencies that would work through existing power structures and paradigms but replace the dollar with something else. We look first at the euro. Created in the wake of the Cold War to bind a newly reborn Europe in shared identity and economic destiny, it entered the COVID-19 crisis in a beleaguered state. Brexit had taken the most valuable economy out of the union and flagging economies within it created significant fragility. What’s more, Europe simply doesn’t have the monetary tools available to a country like the United States. Peter Zeihan, the geopolitical strategist and author of ""Disunited Nations,"" explained it like this: “There’s nothing that the Europeans can do in terms of stimulus spending without raising debt. Even if they decided to do something like QE - which last time took years - they would now have to have the debate over who gets how much. The Europeans are having a hard time raising the capital necessary for dealing with this crisis, whereas the US can just flip a switch.” CoinDesk Chief Content Officer Michael Casey pointed out the European Union is also dealing with questions of political validity, with COVID-19 exacerbating a fundamental issue. “The capacity of the EU to act in unison and the common interest the EU is supposed to represent kind of fell apart. All of a sudden, borders got shutdown and it was each nation to him or herself. So the EU’s validity to manage this has been challenged. COVID is a force for decentralizing power. From a currency perspective, the value of these currencies are political questions. Therefore the EU’s political validity is being questions right now. I’m not sure that’s going to be a very positive environment for the euro.” The next contender profiled is the Libra project. While much of the initial conversation about the libra currency focused on the past transgressions and potential political illegitimacy of its founding organization of Facebook, for economists and system thinkers, the most powerful idea contained in the project was the idea of a global currency standard backed by a basket of the world’s fiat rather than pegged to any single currency. In many ways, this harkened back to John Maynard Keynes’ Bretton Woods proposal for a bancor - separate from the individual currencies of nations around the world. Indeed, in many ways, the most interesting impact of Libra initially was getting global central bankers like Mark Carney to propose their own ""synthetic hegemonic currencies.""Finally, we look at China’s digital currency or DCEP. Is it an unbelievable surveillance honeypot? An attempt to front run the West on a key technological innovation? A method of extending economic spheres of influence? Or is it all of the above?Listen to Money Reimagined - Episode 2 to find out. Music by DJ J-Scrilla ""Faith In My Money (Money Printer Go Brrr)"" from the new “Sound Money” album.Produced by NLW and Adam B.

Money Re-Imagined is about the battle for the future of money and the post COVID-19 world and it's a hell of a story. This episode is sponsored by ErisX, the Stellar Development Foundation and Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund. Here's your host NLW.NLW:Welcome back to the breakdown. So on the first episode of this special money reimagined series, we looked at this strange, almost schizophrenia narratives around the U S dollar. On the one hand: money printer go BRRRRRRRR massive stimulus and increasingly exotic forms of QE would suggest for future inflation right? On the other however, in practice the dollar has gotten nothing but stronger and become even more in demand during the crisis.The goal of that episode was to maybe piece through and figure out how these two things, how these two narratives might not be mutually exclusive. NLW:On this episode, however, we are turning our attention and instead we'll be looking at the contenders in this battle for the future of money. These are the insurgents that would replace the dollar in the global order and in particular in this episode, the insurgents who would replace it in an inside the system formal way. So before we fully dive in, let's get some historical context from Niall Ferguson. He's a historian and senior fellow at Stanford's Hoover Institution and the author of works like The Ascent of Money. It wasn't always a foregone conclusion that the world would be organized around a single dominant standard like the U S dollar. In fact, as Ferguson argues here, this was a byproduct of globalization.Niall Ferguson:Some of the greatest theorists about money... Hayek, for example, Friedman, thought it better for the to be multiple competing currencies rather than a single global standard. And there were plenty of periods in history when that was the case. There were multiple currencies in, for example, 17th century Europe, and there were in fact many different forms of payment across the United States in the 19th century. Standardization of money came relatively late to the world. It began with the British gold standard, which by around 1900 was a global standard pegging currencies to a specific quantity of gold. I think one of the lessons of history is that with globalization comes a tendency for a particular currency to become the number one dominant currency for transactions, for trade, for international reserves. In the 19th century, it was the British pound. In the 20th century, it became the U S dollar.Niall Ferguson:And a great question to ask is globalization enters phase of crisis. Will there be some other transition from the dollar to another currency or could we see a reversion to a multipolar, multicurrency world of the salt that we've seen in previous eras.NLW:""A unipolar monetary order"" was a byproduct of globalization. Globalization is being unwound right now and unwound in an accelerated fashion, thanks to COVID-19 so when it comes to the U S dollar system, does this mean an unraveling too, and if so, who might be stepping up? That's really the whole point of today's episode. Let's look first to the Euro. If the Genesis of the global dollar standard that we're on now was the end of world war two and the Bretton Woods conference, the Euro came about as Europe tried to Reforge both a shared identity and a shared economic destiny after the fall of the Soviet union. Agreed upon in principle in the Maastrichtt treaty in 1992, the Euro would come into being real form.NLW:About a decade later. It quickly became the second most widely used reserve currency after the U S dollar, but as Europe and the Euro came into the COVID-19 crisis, both were on kind of shaky ground. Brexit had taken the most valuable economy out of the European union and flagging economies within the union created pretty significant fragility. In this clip, we revisit comments from the geopolitical strategist and author of Disunited nations, Peter Zeihan.Peter Zeihan:The degree to which the United States is the sole... Sole store of value in the global system was already pretty extreme in the last few years, and it's only gone up during the crisis because there's nothing that the Europeans can do in terms of stimulus spending without actually raising debt. Even if they decide to do something like QE like the United States has done, they don't have to have to have the debate, which last time took years over who gets how much of whatever the stimulus spending happens to be and no one wants to throw money... Any more money than they have to in the black hole that has become Greece, Italy, despite the death rate and how tragic that is has had 30 years to clean up their banking sector, they've actually gone the wrong direction and no one in Europe wants to be responsible for paying for that.Peter Zeihan:So aside from some German debt, because there's actually a shortage of high quality debt in Europe, the Europeans are having a hard time raising the capital that is necessary to deal with this crisis, whereas the U S can just flip a switch and that's what we've done. If the Euro continues to exist, it will exist over a shriveled demographically spent economy that is no longer capable of exports. That's not a functional bloc and that's their best case scenario. More likely, this whole thing just breaks up. And the United States basically absorbs a huge amount of capital from Europe.NLW:CoinDesk chief content officer, Michael Casey takes this argument around the Euro farther saying in some ways it's inherently a question of political validity.Michael Casey:So the, the Euro is actually a really interesting way to think about some of the other questions. Those of us who are interested in cryptocurrencies and new currency designs go about perceiving things because in of itself, right. It was a really interesting experiment. It's an entirely different way of thinking about issuance of a sovereign currency because it's a Federation of otherwise sovereign Nation States who are yes, are bound with some level of political unity but within the EU, but are otherwise independent but have this one common currency. And that disconnect between sort of the local political power and the reduced political power at the EU level... And the common currency is actually at the heart of the Euro crisis that we saw maybe 10 years ago. The capacity of the EU to act in unison and the common interest that the EU was supposed to represent kind of fell apart, right?Michael Casey:Everybody was each to their own, Italy was unto its own Spain with central. All of a sudden borders got shut down. It was all each nation to him or herself as the pandemic took hold. So that is kind of validity as an entity to manage this I think has been challenged somewhat. COVID-19 is a force for decentralizing power. It's pushing interest down to the local level. And so I think from a currency perspective, the value of these currencies are political questions. Therefore the EU's own sort of political validity is being challenged right now. I'm not sure that's going to be a very positive environment for the Euro.NLW:Of course, the contenders in the battle for the future of money aren't just other sovereign currencies that exist today, like the beleaguered Euro. Coming up after the break, we turn our attention to something more digital and potentially even more disruptive.Announcer:Support for this podcast and this message come from ErisX with ErisX.

What if we made money truly global, stable and secure? What if everyone was invited to the global economy with access to the same financial opportunities? Introducing Libra, a new global payment system designed for the digital world, backed by the belief that money should be fast for Opai and Lagos. Simple for Saul's family business in Manila. And secure for Betsabe when sending money home to Mexico City. It's powered by blockchain, making it safe and accessible no matter who you are or where you're from....NLW:In July of 2019 Facebook stunned the financial world with the announcement of Libra. Libra was a new global money to be governed by an association of corporations and nonprofits. Importantly, and disruptively Libra wouldn't get it stability from a peg to a single fiat currency, but instead would be backed by a basket of fiat currencies. Now, much of the ensuing attention focused on questions of Facebook's legitimacy in leading the project. They had outstanding and unresolved criticism around data practices and in the U S in particular, there were huge issues with the government vis-a-vis the 2016 elections. For economists and systems thinkers however, it was this basket of currencies idea that was the most interesting thing. For some, it looked like a modern day version of the Bancor, a global pan-national currency, first proposed by John Maynard Keynes at Bretton Woods. Macro researcher. Luke Grommen provides a quick synopsis of that proposalLuke Grommen:At the end of world war II at Bretton Woods, there were two options. John Maynard Keynes proposed something called the Bancor, which was a neutral settlement asset that floated in all currencies and would have basically prevented systemic deficits and surpluses from building up over time that we have since seen. Because we didn't go with the Bancor. We went with a proposal from the United States as voiced by Harry Dexter White, which was the dollar is the center of the system. The dollar's pegged to gold at $35 an ounce and everything else is then tied to the dollar and it provided the U S what De Gaulle called ""exorbitant privilege"".NLW:When Facebook proposed the structure for its Libra, it sparked conversations at the highest level of global central bankers about whether the dollar system was to the continued benefit of the world. In this clip, Ferguson again discusses a similar sounding proposal from the then bank of England governor Mark Carney for what he called a quote, synthetic hegemonic currency.Niall Ferguson:Mark Carney gave a brilliant paper at the Jackson Hole Federal Reserve conference last summer in 2019 in which he argued that it was inherently unstable for the United States dollar to be ""world money"" for a variety of reasons. One of which being that that puts the position of the Federal Reserve into being essentially the world's central bank when it's mandated just to be the U S national central bank. Carney argued that we should be looking at ways of creating some surrogate digital currency linked potentially to more than one of the existing currencies. This bore more than a passing resemblance to what Facebook was trying to do with Libra, which was going to be a digital currency linked to existing currencies that would be held in a Swiss based reserve. We are, I think in other words, in an era of experimentation,NLW:""An era of experimentation"". As it turns out that experimentation would not be limited to the wide eye dreams of tech companies. If U S regulators reacted to Libra with scorn at their past transgressions and the established monetary order took it as a moment to discuss a highly theoretical new non sovereign currency system. There was one party that reacted to Libra as a direct competitive threat. Coming up after the break, why one of the most speedy and significant responses to Libra came from ChinaAnnouncer:Support for this podcast and this message come from Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund.

It's the only publicly traded investment product that offers diversified exposure to large cap digital currencies all from your brokerage account. For more information, visit grayscale.co/coindesk.NLW:Even before the discussion of Libra and central bank digital currencies, China had built up a comparatively advanced system of mobile money. Niall Ferguson puts it in the context of how robust the Chinese corporate mobile money system is as compared to the experiments we were just discussing.Niall Ferguson:In fact, the most advanced of these experiments since Carney's paper is just a sketch and Libra is still at the launchpad stages in China where the Chinese technology companies have created a new kind of payment system, payment platforms like Alipay and it's 10cent equivalent, which are no longer just confined to China but are being adopted in more and more emerging markets.NLW:The relationship between private companies and the Chinese state of course, something very different from that of governments and companies in the West, but still if the Chinese communist party enjoyed the ability to surveil transactions through relationships with Ali pay and WeChatPay a digital currency would be something completely different. And on a whole different level, castle Island ventures, Nick Carter puts the opportunity for them pretty bluntly.Nic Carter:You know, China has grasped that if you control someone's finances and more generally someone's credit relationships that you effectively control that individual and you have full transparency into what they're doing and what their life is like. And so you have granular discretion to modify their behavior in any way.NLW:China began researching a prospective digital currency between 2014 and 2015 in the aftermath of Libra. However, there was a new significance in communications from the People's Bank of China who were dead set on sending a clear signal to the world that they intended to be the first major nation to bring a digital currency to market. Matthew Graham is the CEO of Sino global capital and has been based in China for the better part of seven years. In this clip he discusses how the crypto tech and finance communities in China responded to the increased focus on a Chinese DCEP or digital currency and electronics payment system last year.Matthew Graham:You know, I think it's important to understand that there are many different ecosystems and many different constituencies that play into something like that. So I think for some of the crypto OGs in China, it's just a question of what even is this? Is this crypto? Is it not crypto? How do we interact with something like DCEP and people choose to do that in a number of ways. For some people, they saw it as an opportunity to introduce new people to crypto through kind of a halo effect. For other groups of people that I saw it as a business opportunity where they could service many of the companies such as Alibaba and Ping An, which is a huge insurance company that are trying to find ways to integrate blockchain into their business. For companies like 10cent and Alibaba that have huge existing digital payments businesses with Alipay and with Tenpay, which is WeChatPay. I think there's a little bit of an under-covered story, which is that the Chinese government with DCEP is potentially competing with their enormously lucrative digital payments businesses. So there are a lot of moving parts here. There are all kinds of interacting. But the one thing then in common is that there were more eyes on blockchain and on crypto, both in China and internationally as a result of DCEP. And of course, Libra as well.NLW:Going into 20, 20 many believe that China's DSF would be one of the most important stories, not only in crypto but in global financial markets as a whole venture capitalist. Catherine Wu put it like this in January of 2020,Katherine Wu:I think every major Chinese tech company will launch a blockchain solution and all of their payment platforms will incorporate the Chinese DCEP, which is their digital currency, electric payment system. You know, I've always long thought that the only state backed stable coin or digital currency or whatever you want to call it, that will gain adoption and wide usage would be a China state backed currency instead of something like Libra. And you know, we sort of saw the announcement of DCEP, like sort of, this fall, but I think this reality will gain fruition in 2020.NLW:Interestingly, some argued that if anything COVID-19 created even more of a motivation for China to push forward with their DCEP project.Michael Casey:China's economy went into a tailspin before everybody else's. It went down into lockdown earlier than others. And the Chinese government needs these rapid growth rates to basically stand-up the political bargain that they've maintained with their population for the, for the last, you know, 30 odd years. We control your lives. Um, you know, we, we have certain constraints on your ability to move capital and to do certain things, but in return we'll give you economic growth and wellbeing and it'll continue to improve your lives. So on that basis, the Chinese have from time to time, just put their foot on the accelerator and thrown massive amounts of stimulus money to build bridges to nowhere and all sorts of ghost cities and everything else and managed to keep the machine going, building up massive amounts of debt in the process. And now they have to come out of this.Michael Casey:And so say that that bargain is under threat because of the slow... The massive downturn we will have faced. How do we get out of it? There's two things I think that they do. You know, one is they entered into a currency war. It's just, it's what you do. They desperately need to boost it and the currency is one tool that they have, um, from that is in terms of the value of the Yuan. And the other is that they use all this technology to absolutely fast track, innovation and development both domestically and overseas with all of their various partners using the digital currency as the vehicle through which they integrate all of those relationships.NLW:That was CoinDesk's Chief Content Officer Michael Casey, again, on how COVID-19 has created a new context for China's DCEP currency. All right, let's take a moment to gut check on the actors in this battle for the future of money. The Euro is in its own crises as it tries to figure out the politics of individual national healthcare response in the context of a common economic response. This is especially tricky as the ability for the European central bank to engage in the sort of quantitative easing that has become de rigueur in the USA is being challenged in court. Add it up, and you certainly don't see or don't expect a big move into the Euro. What about China? As we've seen, there's no doubt that they're moving aggressively forward with their digital currency project. The problem is that the fancy new digital model is still resting on shaky foundations.NLW:First, the world's opinion of Chinese leadership is flagging. Reuters is reporting that an internal report presented to the leaders of the CCP concluded that anti-Chinese sentiment, was at the highest it's been since Tiananmen square. Second, the Yuan to date has been primarily an internal currency. Peter Zeihan explains:Peter Zeihan:China's a bit of a black box because they... What data they do share, they tend to lie about. But we know that 99% of the Yuan in circulation is all within the mainland. It's not an internationally traded currency at all.NLW:And what about Libra? Well, the basket of currencies approach may have intrigued economists and even a few global central bankers. It created an instant regulatory brick wall in the USA. Libra tried to argue that the US's position in the global order was being maintained by having the USD comprise the largest single stake in the basket.NLW:Something like 50% of the basket was intended to be U S dollars. What's more, as they saw their positive message of banking, the unbanked wasn't working. Libra switched pretty aggressively to an argument that if we don't do this, China will. US regulators simply weren't buying it and this is to say nothing of the European countries who immediately called Libra an afront to their monetary sovereignty. By April of 2020, project lead, David Marcus summoned all of his optimism to announce that they had decided to pursue the much less ambitious model of ""individual fiat pegged stable coins"". Instead of allowing anyone to build wallets and applications for the currency, it would be entirely permissioned and within the system instead of the disruptor that would usher in a new non-sovereign modern bancor, they were effectively setting themselves up to compete with tether and USDC and maybe to build the rails and be the consultants for central banks who wanted to make their own digital currencies.NLW:From this vantage point, the continued supremacy of the U S dollar in its current form seems assured, but we don't live in a world anymore where the only types of money are those that come from governments or even work through the official channels. The times, '03, January, 2009 ""chancellor on the brink of a second bailout for banks"". These are the words embedded in the Bitcoin Genesis block words that harkened back to the last financial crisis, even as Libra failed to impress. There were those in power who recognized a new force on the scene. Representative Patrick McHenry in his opening remarks at the first Libra hearing.Representative Patrick McHenry :Change is here. Digital currencies exist. Blockchain technology is real, and Facebook's entry in this new world is just confirmation, albeit at scale. The world that Satoshi Nakamoto, author of the Bitcoin white paper envisioned and others are building is an unstoppable force. We should not attempt to deter this innovation and governments cannot stop this innovation and those that have tried have already failed.NLW:In our next episode of money reimagined, we look more closely at that unstoppable force.
