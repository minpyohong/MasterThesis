","The bitcoin price lost more than 10% in a matter of minutes yesterday evening, dropping to lows of $8,100 on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange before rebounding to settle around $8,600. However, an outage on major U.S. bitcoin and crypto exchange Coinbase just after bitcoin's price plummet left many users unable to trade—the second time in less than a month Coinbase has buckled under stress.Coinbase users were unable to trade bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for around an hour last ... [+] night, with systems apparently overwhelmed just as the bitcoin price suddenly dropped.""How many times do we have to say take your bitcoin off of Coinbase if you want to have access to it,"" Rachel Siegel, a bitcoin and cryptocurrency content creator, warned via Twitter, adding, ""this is not the first time Coinbase has gone down and it surely will not be the last.""""Coinbase acting like the NYSE circuit breaking,"" joked Jason Williams, cofounder and partner at bitcoin and crypto hedge fund Morgan Creek Digital, suggesting that Coinbase outages could dampen spikes and dips in the bitcoin price. Coinbase acknowledged the outage and said it was ""investigating this issue"" before declaring the incident resolved three hours later. Coinbase has been contacted for further comment.Intermittent Coinbase outages are becoming a predictable problem for users of the popular San Francisco-based bitcoin and crypto exchange.At the end of last month, just as bitcoin rallied some 15% to around $9,000, Coinbase experienced a similar outage—despite data provider Skew finding Coinbase volume was not excessively high relative to other peaks in trading volume during the past two weeks.Some Coinbase users were unable to access their accounts between 5:26pm PDT and 9pm PDT last night ... [+] just as the bitcoin price dropped sharply. Coinbase also went down in March, leaving users locked out of their accounts during the broad coronavirus crash that wiped more than 20% from bitcoin's value in mere minutes. Users reported at least two similar issues over the course of 2019.Problems for Coinbase come as the bitcoin and crypto community is gearing up for next week's highly-anticipated bitcoin supply squeeze, known as a halving. The looming bitcoin halving, set for early on May 12, will be the third since bitcoin was created just over a decade ago, and will see the number of bitcoin rewarded to the so-called miners that maintain the bitcoin network halved—dropping from 12.5 bitcoin per block to 6.25.Many expect bitcoin volatility and trading volumes to spike this week."

Photographer: Luke MacGregor/Bloomberg","Bitcoin prices have floundered lately, failing to recover much of their losses after falling sharply on Saturday. The digital currency fluctuated between $8,000 and $9,000 today, after losing more than 16% of its value yesterday, CoinDesk figures show. The cryptocurrency rose to more than $9,800 on Saturday, before plunging below $8,200, additional CoinDesk data reveals. [Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.]When explaining this recent price action, several analysts pointed to anxiety surrounding the upcoming halving, which is currently scheduled to take place tomorrow at roughly 7 p.m. ET. “I think people are nervous before the halving,” said Marouane Garcon, managing director of crypto-to-crypto derivatives platform Amulet. “There’s a lot of hesitation and uncertainty surrounding the event and it shows,” he stated. “People are waiting for a price jump after the event before they fully commit,” said Garcon, emphasizing that this is what is needed for bitcoin to “reach its previous levels.”Denis Vinokourov, head of research for London-based digital asset firm Bequant, also spoke to this reluctance.He noted that while “bulls” recently “managed to push Bitcoin above $10k level,” there was a “distinct lack of follow through action, which suggests hesitation and market nervousness ahead of key risk event.”The upcoming halving is creating uncertainty, something considered anathema to many investors. John Iadeluca, founder & CEO of multi-strategy fund Banz Capital, weighed in on this situation. “On one hand, the Bitcoin halving offers an immensely bullish point of view in that miners will shift to a more pseudonymous network backend maintenance position with exchanges and institutions assuming a role in facilitating economic participation,” he noted. “An environment of the like is frightening, and combined with the fact that miners receive less after the halving on May 11th, there could arise the possibility of drastic decrease in mining activity,” said Iadeluca. “Alongside the halving is an influx of new interested investors and users who will flock to retail exchanges to start with Bitcoin, and with Coinbase, arguably the most popular retail crypto exchange, suffering outage once again with days left to the halving, new as well as institutional investors would feel fear,” he concluded.

Just don’t tell Americans. A statement released today detailing the investment opportunity makes it very clear in bold letters at the top: NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION TO UNITED STATES NEWSWIRE SERVICES OR FOR DISSEMINATION IN THE UNITED STATES. In spite of being traded on the Canadian exchange, the value of the investment is denominated in U.S. dollars.While not technically the widely anticipated bitcoin exchange traded fund (ETF) that many institutional investors have been waiting for, this is a closed end fund better described as an exchange traded product. The price of bitcoin increased 5% over the past 24-hours, crossing $10,000 last night, and was trading at $9,995 at the time of publication, according to OnChainFX.com.The investment, co-led by Canaccord Genuity Corp. and Echelon Wealth Partners Inc., also including Leede Jones Gable Inc., Mackie Research Capital Corporation and PI Financial Corp. is not allowed to be marketed to U.S. investors as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has been reluctant to approve similar products for U.S. investors.A disclosure at the bottom of the statement reads: “This news release does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any of the securities in the United States. The securities have not been and will not be registered under the United States Securities Act.” Sorry Americans.While 3iQ’s Bitcoin Fund product isn’t registered to serve U.S. investors a number of U.S. firms were involved in its creation, including New York-based ARK Invest, Van Eck and Doyle Capital. Both VanEck and Jack Tatar of Doyle Capital Management have confirmed they were also investors. The fund uses the MVIS index developed by VanEck.“My goal and my involvement in this product has been to get an easy to invest product to investors looking to get exposure to bitcoin,” says Tatar, who also edits investment newsletter Forbes Crypto Asset & Blockchain Advisor. According to Tatar the Canadian fund’s shares can be purchased via certain brokerage firms including Fidelity and Interactive Brokers.Founded in 2012 to help build institutional grade investment products for cryptocurrencies, 3iQ Corp. acted as the manager and portfolio manager of the Fund.The previously announced offering closed yesterday at a price of U.S. $11.87 per Class A unit and U.S. $11.63 per Class F unit for total gross proceeds of approximately US$48 million.  The Fund’s investment objectives are to provide investors who might not otherwise be permitted to hold bitcoin to gain exposure to the daily price movements of the asset and the opportunity for long-term capital appreciation.The completion of the fund marks a milestone for Canadian institutional and accredited investors, while the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has shot down multiple applications for similar products, including from Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, Bitwise and more recently Wilshire Phoenix. Those who participated have the option to purchase up to an additional 15% of the Class A units issued on the closing date of the Offering, for 30 days from today."

(Photo by Jacques Witt / POOL / AFP) (Photo credit should read JACQUES WITT/AFP/Getty Images)","Recently, an internal Chinese state report was released, prepared by a thinktank long associated with China’s intelligence agency (the Ministry of State Security or MSS for short) which hinted at the possibility of conflict with the United States. It concluded that anti-Chinese sentiment was at its highest since the Tiananmen Square Massacre. Back then, international powers sanctioned China and the Chinese state was isolated. Since then, China has emerged and grown into the world’s second largest economy.A source with knowledge of the letter compared it to the Novikov telegram. Novikov was the Soviet ambassador to the United States during the immediate post-war period. In 1946, he dispatched a message to Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov warning of America’s foreign policy, presaging the decades-long Cold War between the Soviet Union and the United States of America. There are signs of a coming economic decoupling everywhere you look and a potential cold war. China is doubling down on censoring criticism of its handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. It has reportedly detained the maintainers of Terminus2049, an independent online repository that hosted censored news articles about the COVID-19 outbreak. Local authorities are now using the police to threaten the relatives of the victims of the COVID-19 pandemic in Wuhan who want to sue the government. Meanwhile, tensions have risen as countries and organizations such as Sweden, the United States, the European Commission and Australia have asked for an independent investigation into the origins of the pandemic while China has pushed back.How might Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies fare in a US-China trade war that worsens? There are some notable downsides. It’s possible that faced with a larger break in economic ties, China might impose stricter capital controls on its population and redouble efforts on its own central bank digital currency, trying to cut off China and its citizens from the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. It’s also possible that Bitcoin will suffer short-term price decreases, since it has taken on more of a speculative position given institutional investor interest.Yet, there are some surprising ways Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies might actually see an upside with a US-China cold war. The first notable one is that it is likely existing fiat and capital gateways between the largest and second largest economies would become significantly disrupted. Already, in Hong Kong, credible fears have arisen that with the coming “economic storm”, that the “One Country, Two Systems” framework that helped Hong Kong form a credible capital bridge between China and the rest of the world might be in the process of being abandoned.China’s economy still has a large export-driven component to it — though it has receded from a 2008 peak of about 36% of GDP, at 20% of GDP, exports still represent a significant chunk. Those businesses and exporters are not all suddenly going to be able to shift from the extra margins export gives them without significant economic pain. There will be a need for cross-border capital flows as existing capital bridges decay — something cryptocurrencies might play a role in. After all, cryptocurrencies trade at a premium on Asian exchanges, and has a slightly inverse correlation with the Chinese Yuan. Secondly, as both parties start retrenching towards spheres of economic influence, with China likely gravitating towards Southeast Asia, Africa and Belt and Road countries and the United States trying to patch up relationships with its North American, South American and European counterparts, both spheres are going to suffer from less economic growth because they will not be able to take advantage of comparative advantage and free trade across the board. This is likely going to be a deliberate choice when it comes to certain industries: for example, you might want to keep medical supplies and their manufacturing strictly within the bounds of your closest political sphere of influence.Yet the effect of this in aggregate will be a likely global decrease in growth rate right as economies are struggling out of the gate thanks to the effect of COVID-19 lockdowns. The Great Depression was worsened and extended by the effect of tariffs and economic tension between different partners — as well as tightening monetary policy. It is a lesson writ large for those that manage the monetary system, one of the only analogues central bankers are going to find for the current situation and one they go to readily (Ben Bernanke, for example, was noted for calling upon his research into the Great Depression to guide choices he made in the 2008-2009 Great Recession).What this will mean in the short-to-medium term and perhaps over a longer time horizon if economic growth doesn’t pick up is that there is going to be loose monetary policy, which should have inflationary effects as the monetary base increases to try to stimulate growth. This will help support investment assets like cryptocurrencies for institutional investors — and help advance a very stark contrast between the deflationary economics of cryptocurrencies and inflationary policies of monetary authorities. Billionaire investor Paul Tudor Jones made this argument as he was loading up on Bitcoin, saying that the cryptocurrency reminded him “of the role gold played in the 1970s [as an inflationary hedge].”Finally, as more and more business and services are forced to move online due to multiple lockdowns, the potential for digital means of exchange to power larger parts of the economy will remain quite large. With tension between China and the United States, a global standard for digital currency from a central bank will succumb to competition between two different standard-bearers who are quickly becoming fierce geopolitical rivals. This may help accelerate cryptocurrencies as consumers look towards a truly global cross-border payments system. A potential worsening of the US-China trade war and subsequent cold war would have many unforeseen consequences. Yet, packed within the effects are both some downside risks for cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin — as well as some surprising and strong upside factors."

The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down almost 18% year to date after recovering from a 33% drop earlier, but Bitcoin is even over the same time frame after its recovery. Many expected that this general sense of instability around the world would be Bitcoin’s (and digital currency’s, in general) time to shine. However, this belief may stem from a misunderstanding of digital currencies. Or, perhaps, since this pandemic is unlike anything the digital currency industry has experienced before, we simply should not have these expectations at all.We have seen an increase in over-the-counter trading (OTC) volume in February and March of 2020 of digital currencies, ever since the pandemic has become major news around the world. Initially, the digital currency market experienced decreased prices across the board as many investors liquidated their holdings. However, these investors were not simply capitulating their holdings for cash, but rather reinvesting in “stablecoins” such as Tether, which is pegged to the U.S. dollar. Since stablecoins are pegged to a fiat or national currency, they are significantly less volatile than traditional stocks and digital currencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and pose a greater store of value. That is not to say that Bitcoin and other digital currencies have been faring poorly, however. In fact, while Bitcoin is even on its year to date (YTD), it is up over 30% from April 2019 to April 2020 and up 12% from March 15 to April 15 of 2020).Despite this, many critics of digital currencies have hammered the industry and its supporters, stating that digital currencies are not the safe haven they thought they were. These critics believed that, in this pandemic, we would see digital currencies boom, and while Bitcoin did top $10,000 in February of 2020, it has not lived up to their expectations. However, those in the digital currency industry would argue that Bitcoin did exactly as expected in the environment: Investors either capitulated their holdings for cash or liquidated and reinvested in other safer stores of value such as stablecoins. Who is right in this situation? The answer is, simply, both. When viewing an industry as new as the digital currency industry, we are restricted in the amount of historical data we can analyze. Since this industry has never faced a global pandemic like we are facing now, it is almost impossible to accurately hypothesize how the industry will respond.So, what exactly is the bottom line here? Are digital currencies the safe haven we thought they were or not? Since Bitcoin has been referred to as “digital gold,” we have seen many investors turn to Bitcoin as a store of value, but due to the recent drop in the price of Bitcoin, it became just like every other financial asset. However, the answer is more complex than that. While Bitcoin has been even year to date and up over the past 12 months, the safe-haven view of Bitcoin has been split among investors and countries. In certain countries with strict capital controls, digital currencies like Bitcoin have shown their benefit of being able to transact freely. In general, digital currencies have proven themselves to be a great benefit and store of value during this pandemic because they allow traders to buy, sell and convert from their homes much faster and at significantly cheaper fees than fiat currencies.In regard to stablecoins, the G20 has been considering the implementation of proper regulations around them due to the increased interest and investment in recent months. However, it seems that the overall uncertainty in the markets stemming from fear of the pandemic is keeping investors from moving more into the market; they would rather hold on to cash until we can start to see the light at the end of the tunnel.It is also important to note that Bitcoin’s movement is also being caused by speculation regarding the upcoming “halving” event, which is set to take place on May 15, 2020. Here, the mining/issuance of new Bitcoins is going to be cut in half, tightening the supply of Bitcoins in the market. Assuming that demand for Bitcoin remains the same, the reduced supply would result in an increase in price. However, the majority of this price change was first experienced at the end of 2019 when investors began “hodling” Bitcoin in preparation for the halving event. “Hodling,” originally a misspelling of ""holding"" that has since become the standard term, refers to the “buy and hold” strategy. It could simply be that many investors have been holding on to their cash and waiting for this halving moment to jump into the market.While this pandemic has caused widespread fear and uncertainty in the markets, and uncertainty about the future, investors have been looking for opportunities to safely invest their hard-earned cash. Some stocks are seemingly “pandemic-proof,” such as Amazon (AMZN), but others are too volatile to speculate and invest in. We initially saw an increase in investments for digital currencies, pumping the price of Bitcoin to above $10,000 and other coins like Ethereum (ETH) above $280. Since then many investors liquidated their holdings and moved into stablecoins, due to their less-volatile nature of being pegged to a fiat currency while providing the benefits of being a digital currency. However, I suspect that the majority of the investors are waiting for things to clear up before investing their cash. At this point, we can speculate and invest in what we view are safe havens until we can see the light at the end of the tunnel."

A trend that could continue and be made more challenging by recent volatility.David was hired last month as Global Managing Director of European and Asian Markets to drive the Company's institutional growth. He sees Pacific-based expansion as a critical component for financial services growth in volatile global markets, some hostile to blockchain-based ventures. He said, about their Asian expansion plans, ""With 4.5 billion of the world's 7.5 billion people, and a young demographic tilt, it only makes sense that a technology-oriented firm like BlockFi sees Asia as one of our big opportunities. On the institutional side, sentiment is beginning to shift. Recently, Arrano Capital, a fund manager gained approval from the Securities & Futures Commission in Hong Kong for a bitcoin tracking fund. There is also the talk of China developing a central digital currency. We would like to be on the ground as the wave of adoption builds momentum, not after."""
10,https://www.forbes.com/,,How To Navigate Regulation Crowdfunding With Crypto And Blockchain,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonbrett/2020/05/10/how-to-navigate-regulation-crowdfunding-with-crypto-and-blockchain/,,"<div class=""content-data light-text""><span class=""hidden pageviews-wrapper""></span><time>May 10, 2020,</time><span class=""time""><time>08:07pm EDT</time></span></div>","Read this article to learn from a seasoned entrepreneur who has been working for 20 years at her craft how to take advantage of SEC Regulation Crowdfunding. Regulation Crowdfunding is an exception at the SEC that allows companies to raise up to $1,070,000 through an online platform to the public. She found that to receive the necessary SEC approval for her second crowdfunding campaign, it was unspoken but necessary to drop the use of crypto and blockchain. From challenging the typical way of raising money through venture capital to navigating the U.S. regulatory landmines for fundraising, this is a story you do not want to miss. ","Dawn Dickson, Founder and CEO of PopCom Dawn Dickson is the founder and CEO of PopCom, a company she has been working on since 2012 that is an automated retail technology company with a hardware and software (SaaS) solution for self-service retail. Essentially, PopCom makes vending machines and kiosks smarter by allowing retailers to collect important analytics at the point of sale and deliver targeted content, similar to how Google analytics analyzes web traffic. With her business involving automated retail technology and self-service machines, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in increased demand for her company’s products, making her investor pitch that much easier. Dickson is the first Black woman to raise over $1 Million under SEC Regulation Crowdfunding (Reg CF) using a security token offering (STO). Currently in the middle of her second Reg CF, PopCom has raised $800,000 in about a month and a half.And if you believe you can start up a technology company easily, she will tell you to start by getting an education in technology first and prepare for months and months of planning before you go to investors - privately or publicly - to raise money. And if asked about her achievement in her first crowdfunding campaign, Dickson will highlight that she formerly had become the first woman … not just the first black woman … to raise $1 million using a blockchain token offering. And as for a disadvantage, according to Dickson, being a graduate from The Ohio State University as opposed to a coastal college and living in the flyover state of Ohio were her biggest obstacles to raising capital for her business. The obstacle of not having the right network to fundraise for her company were the motivation to seek equity from the public. ‘The Jobs Act by Obama leveled the playing field and access to capital for businesses and allows leverage community from accredited and non-accredited investors,’ Dickson explains. For early stage deals where a company is not yet publicly traded, she notes, ‘...an accredited investor needs to make $200,000 as an individual or $300,000 if you are married, and have $1,000,000 in net worth’. Dickson notes these investors are the ‘...same people over and over again who are benefitting from the success of these early-stage companies where the wealth is circulated around the same group of accredited investors.’ Dickson explains she educated herself about how to do a crowdfunding campaign, as has been made possible by President Obama with the Jobs Act. She realized she had families, friends, and a community of supporters that were not accredited investors, but were educated investors with disposable income and understood the risks and rewards of an early-stage investment in a company. Dickson’s time spent in TechStars built her credibility and helped teach her how to raise private venture capital. She notes that, to date, PopCom has raised over $3 million, of which the first million was raised from venture capital and accredited angel investors in 2017-2018. However, it was in 2019 when she took the leap to do a crowdfunding, and it was not an easy decision. When she did her first crowdfunding campaign, Dickson was out of ‘runway’ and spent her last $10,000 to pay for the platform and audited financials to conduct the 2019 campaign. Dickson notes, ‘No institutional investors were supportive of crowdfunding because it takes control out of their hands. They did not teach me about crowdfunding and, no, they did not support it. One investor actually said to me, if you do this, I will never follow on [with an investment]’. Dawn Dickson / Twitter / Crowdfunding Campaign Message That campaign, Dickson states, was the, ‘…First time people had really seen on a mass level a black person [who] does something like this,...[as I was the] first black female founder, first female founder to raise million dollars in a crowdfunding campaign,’ Dickson proudly proclaims. Her first crowdfunding campaign was oversubscribed, with $1.3 million, and now, she is at $800,000, closing in on the $1,070,000 limit for this campaign. Dickson noted that for her, the preparation to be able to answer any question during the fundraising and to not do it defensively is key. ‘In the VC world $1,000,000 is not a lot of money, but with crowdfunding, people are like you blew the money from 2019 already?’ states Dickson. She also emphasizes that a person should really start with going to school and learn about technology before starting a technology company. She cautions that, ‘...[to build a] tech company, you must have technology education, either whether you go to school for it or you go to Techstars or Y Combinator or [another] accelerator to get the proper mentorship and education to grow a company, to build a team, to give yourself credibility, to grow your network.’ This time, her crowdfunding campaign provides equity in the company in the form of stock certificates and is not a token sale. While the last round was a token offering, Dickson comments the SEC does not fully support token offerings. ‘They act like they are okay with crypto and blockchain but their actions show the opposite,’ states Dickson. In that the benefit would be selling the tokenized shares for liquidity on a secondary trading platform, until the SEC decides to approve this, there is no real benefit to having a ‘crypto’ security token offering anyway. A token is a digital version of a share instead of a paper share; the primary benefit of using a token for funding is so you can sell the token for liquidity. Dawn Dickson, Founder and CEO of PopCom, testifying at a U.S. Small Business Committee Hearing on ... [+] March 4 called 'Building Blocks of Change: How Small Businesses Can Benefit From Blockchain Technology' Additionally, these investors could possibly have the option to convert to a tokenized share if the SEC does clear the way for a secondary market. However, for this fundraising round, it was removing any signs of using crypto in her offering. ‘If we included crypto or tokens in our offering document we did not feel confident that the SEC would approve our offering. It’s an unspoken rule. Our new page has no mention of blockchain because they [the SEC] don’t like it,’ Dickson explains. ‘I testified before Congress to help legislators understand the negative stigma put on blockchain is because of bad actors, and they are restricting companies that want to use this technology for good...Should people quit using the fiat dollar because some people are scamming with that?’ Dickson exclaims. When asked if she thought the SEC has a bias against tokens, and if so, where she believes this resistance to tokenized securities comes from, Dickson answers quickly, ‘2017. When many people were becoming millionaires from Bitcoin and the government and banks could not control those markets. That’s just my opinion.’ Dickson encourages people to look into the fact that with COVID-19, the SEC has provided relief and made it even easier to crowdfund, making it a great time to learn crowdfunding. Crowdfunding can be for as little as $50,000 to $100,000 to get the minimal viable product going, according to Dickson. With her second crowdfunding campaign almost concluded, Dawn Dickson will be someone to watch. Her leadership is already illuminating some of the real-world challenges of navigating as a crypto or blockchain company. Most importantly, she has opened the door to a new class of thirsty investors using blockchain tokens and blockchain technology for crowdfunding."

How To Make Money In Post-COVID-19 Times,https://www.forbes.com/sites/nataliakarayaneva/2020/05/09/how-to-make-money-in-post-covid-19/,,"<div class=""content-data light-text""><span class=""hidden pageviews-wrapper""></span><time>May 9, 2020,</time><span class=""time""><time>01:33pm EDT</time></span></div>",What Should Startups And VCs Build? How To Make Money In Post-COVID-19 Times,"It certainly feels strange to read articles on how to make money during these COVID-19 times, especially now - when the world is in a state of turmoil. Quite contrary to capitalist principles, the pandemic seems to have brought humans together in empathy. Unity after tragedy is taking effect, helping us focus more on one another rather than on our personal selves. In this case, we can credit ourselves for choosing life over money.This is a hard time for all of us. We must re-evaluate our businesses, investments, the status quo, and even our core values while preparing to crawl out of shelter-in-place directives to a new reality. What should we focus our energy on during this major transition period? As Marc Andreessen recently noted, “It's time to build.” However, his statement sparks a set of questions, such as, “What should we be building?” Below, I share my thoughts on what is relevant for startups and VCs in the tech, real estate, and blockchain industries:As a former real estate developer, I created real-world, tangible assets. I could see happy people living in my buildings, a clear indication that my efforts were worth the result.In my current role as a software developer, things are more complicated. I must evaluate the fundamentals and the importance of my creations. This is not relevant to just me. The entire tech community must evaluate its contributions. Are the projects we are building becoming part of the core infrastructure of the future, or are they simply window dressings (or “icing on the cake”)? In the past, fundamental technologies such as e-signatures and e-notaries have not been recognized as essential “pills” but rather as know-how that is akin to “vitamins,” at least in the real estate industry. Everyone understood the inevitable uniqueness of the emerging innovative tech branches, but nobody wanted to wait for governments and industries to make the shift toward this direction. Today, years later, we see DocuSign (founded by Tom Gonser) and Notarize (a five-year-old company founded by Pat Kinsel) among the top-performing stocks. These firms are finally getting the attention that they deserve.The pandemic forces old-fashioned industries such as real estate to adopt new technologies. It also forces overhyped emerging tech such as blockchain and AI to be re-evaluated and shifted toward incentivizing startups to “buidl” useful apps that are relevant for the future.The real estate market and proptech companies are in an ambivalent situation: the market is alive but uncertain, and the demand for more digital transactions is surging. Some business models, such as iBuyer platforms, are not viable for operating during crises (you can learn more in my Forbes article); iBuyer companies, such as Opendoor (founded by entrepreneurs including Eric Wu and Keith Rabois), are now just beginning to resume their operations. Business models that do survive the hostile pandemic environment will ultimately find themselves in much better shape than ever.Fortunately, the U.S. real estate industry reached a level of digitalization that allowed the market to prevent itself from coming to a complete halt during the pandemic. When it comes to furthering digitalization, there are enormous opportunities for entrepreneurs, existing tech-driven companies, and investors. My company, as a part of the real estate digital ecosystem, felt the demand for property deal transactions to take place firsthand and exclusively online, similar to Notarize.com (which is leading in its niche by offering notary public services 24/7 in an entirely digital way). Other industry participants are offering virtual tours, improvements of self-made pictures and virtual staging such as BoxBrownie.com, and other digital services. However, complete digitalization of the real estate space is only the first step. To fully meet the needs of consumers, modern-day companies will also need to face and tackle other challenges.One such challenge is affordability. It is crucially important that tech products are affordable for consumers, taking into account current financial and economic uncertainties. This rule is especially true when it comes to recurrent payments, such as commitments to SaaS subscriptions.Last but not least, a much greater challenge is bringing up the overall health of the real estate market. It is obvious that if a housing crisis develops and sales stop, software products will not be in demand until the market bounces back. There are currently signs of a housing crisis in some areas, such as NYC’s Manhattan and SoCal. Other areas, including China, are showing rapid recoveries in the post-COVID-19 market space.We have yet to see COVID-19’s full impact on the real estate industry. In one of his recent tweets, Redfin CEO Glenn Kelman predicts stability:“Prices aren’t dropping now. Supply is down 25% YoY. Buying demand is nearing pre-pandemic levels. Urban condos & vacation homes are hard to sell. Other homes aren’t. Mortgage forbearance, & the drop in working-class home-ownership, have precluded the immediate foreclosures of ‘08.”I also expect to see further changes in the emerging technologies fields, such as blockchain technology. Last year, the burden of federal regulations imposed on Facebook prevented the company from launching its new digital currency alongside the network supporting it. Recently, Telegram became contractually obligated to pay its investors back 72% of their investments for missing the Telegram network launch.The reality is that we do not need more protocols and more networks; we need products. Facebook can build a digital wallet, experimenting first with existing stablecoins and/or bitcoin. Such exposure to the masses would help to bring real innovation to the world. The same applies to Telegram (although, I believe that Pavel Durov, the founder of Telegram, will further deliver great products).The ugly truth is that inventors and VCs in the blockchain space are hunting for overhyped newborns that can potentially make 10x ROIs within several years. This leaves me with the impression that nobody cares about the real uses of the underlying technologies. Many first-layer networks, such as EOS, Algorand, NEO, and Tezos, received so much capital that they created funds to fund applications on top of their networks. Oddly enough, almost no impactful apps have been launched from these new networks. One reason could be that the focus of the aforementioned funds falls on the second-layer application rather than on the actual product design for end users.The doors for hype and speculation are wide open. However, our focus should not bypass the core human principles of improving the quality of people’s lives. We should be focusing on products that can make a change tomorrow or next year, not just the products that can make a change 10 to 20 years down the road from now. The focus should be on how one investment or technology can make the lives of people better and of higher quality, especially when we witness how fragile our world is when confronted with a devastating pandemic.Fortunately, blockchain technology is coming back to the conversation, due to governmental privacy control dynamics in many countries and numerous conspiracy theories resulting from the pandemic. Members of society are concerned about the sharing and storage of their own data, limited choices, and imposed controls by governments over a vast number of layers of daily life. However, with the help of decentralized protocols for votes and the storing and sharing of data, the issue is fortunately solvable. People who are fighting for change at the state level can improve the way that governance works today. These key individuals can start learning about and working on consensus mechanisms that blockchain technology is capable of offering; this is a space in which there are currently skilled engineers but not enough leaders with soft skills.Andreessen encourages us to build. There are various interpretations of his encouragement: from focusing on physical infrastructure and buildings to continuing developing software tools. What we are building often depends on venture capitalists like Andreesen, who are betting on the future that they foresee. Depending on the decisions of these VCs, the journeys of many inventors and entrepreneurs will be affected for the years to come.The venture capital industry, which has been driving innovation alongside entrepreneurs, can improve. As of now, it is broken in many aspects. Startups are being taught to be short-minded, to overhype, and to deliver revenue. Some of these companies burn cash within one year just to get to the next round of investment (as we have witnessed with WeWork). Thus, the businesses may prioritize fundraising and unhealthy metrics over true innovation and value creation. In my previous article on proptech, I gave an example of how the current framework between startups and VCs force proptech companies to turn themselves into brokerages, lenders, or title companies instead of firms that focus on fundamental innovation.The system is broken because raising a successful series A round depends solely on finding one lead investor. Everyone else comes along after the one lead is onboarded, due to the hype amongst investors. Oftentimes, the due diligence that is conducted neglects the experts’ feedback, team’s achievements and focuses on verifying demand amongst other investors, rather than focusing on engineers, consumers, or industry experts. (I often witness this pattern in Silicon Valley and, in particular, in the crypto space.)The ICO period, the pros together with the cons, gave us hope regarding problems related to the traditional venture capital model. With ICOs’ inventive crowdfunding opportunities, startup founders were no longer dependent on an extremely narrow pool of institutional investors. The token sale approach represented the democratization of access to private equity. However, the major problem with the ICO model was that it was too immature and opportunistic; it had a lack of limitations and a lack of control over valuations, exchanges, and the sizes of capital that were raised by founders.There should be a middle ground in place, where founders can negotiate and work with multiple investors (and not just one lead) to win investments. One option could be fixing the capital size so that it covers a longer runway; however, the funds would need to be delivered in tranches that depend on the achievement of certain milestones. This, in my opinion, would work better than having just nine to twelve months of capital for the runway, before the founder would need to get involved in six months of fundraising to ensure the growth of the company for the next twelve months. In fact, a similar idea was proposed by Vitalik Buterin, who introduced a solution that would help to revolutionize the ICO process and ultimately tackle the current flaws and imperfections of the ERC20 standards.Andreessen Horowitz demonstrated the first signs of willingness to change the venture capital industry. The important thing to note is that the aforementioned firm is a believer in blockchain tech; in fact, founders Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz were also two of the earliest and strongest believers in the Internet. The company recently announced its second crypto fund and a team led by Chris Dixon and Kathie Huan, as well as the addition of new member Ariana Simpson. Furthermore, a16z changed the structure of its fund, allowing the company to now bet on riskier investments.It is crucially important that we re-evaluate what we fund and what we build. We must focus on making 9x in three years, rather than 3x in one year. Inventors should invent. Builders should build. The funding loop should increase in length for startups that aim to make fundamental changes; there should be more milestones and more complex, deliverables-based financing. I will believe that change is happening when hard-working builders like James Ehrlich, a Stanford-based entrepreneur focusing on resilient habitats, get extensive financing; when scientists get more attention from VCs, when startups in modular construction and construction analytics like TraceAir receive more media and investor attention, and when companies like Notarize obtain valuations similar to that of the “not-so-useful” Juicero. These companies probably now have the attention and demand that they deserve, thanks to the pandemic. However, this was not the case a year or two ago (I have been following the progress of these teams).It might sound like naive idealism, but I am a true believer that entrepreneurship is not just about making money. It has a higher purpose: creating value, building tangible products, and delivering on innovations that humanity needs. Over the long term, investors and founders should capitalize on creating value, rather than on creating hype and betting on speculation. Money is an effect, not a cause. Building useful products will not only make society happier and safer; it will also make money for everyone involved. We just need to figure out how to fix the system to make it focus on “usefulness.”"
