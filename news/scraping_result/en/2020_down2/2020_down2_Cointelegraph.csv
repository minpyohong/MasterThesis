mainstream market hype surrounding the event has grown ...",,"With Bitcoin’s (BTC) third mining rewards halving just over 24 hours away, mainstream market hype surrounding the event has grown exponentially, especially after balancing on the $10K threshold for some time. On May 9, BTC dropped to the $8,100 mark before making a small recovery to around $8,800.","Nevertheless, the fact that BTC has overall been able to stave off bearish market pressure instilled a certain amount of confidence in the hearts of investors all over the globe — despite Bitcoin facing a 15% value slip on May 9.Additionally, it bears mentioning that since dropping to a price point of around $3,867 registered on March 12, Bitcoin’s value has almost tripled, so much so that a report released by blockchain research firm IntoTheBlock claims that nearly 85% — or 25.79 million — of all wallet addresses holding Bitcoin can currently sell at a profit from their holdings.With all of that information out there, it is worth delving deeper into the question of what do Bitcoin’s key market indicators actually suggest about the currency’s future after its halving event, and whether or not the crypto asset is destined for a major financial upswing — as many pundits have repeatedly pointed out since the start of the year.To get a better understanding of everything that’s happening right now with the halving, Cointelegraph reached out to Pascal Gauthier, the CEO of Ledger, a hardware crypto wallet manufacturer, who believes that Bitcoin’s Fear and Greed Index has remained very conservative all through March and April. However, he did add that his firm has noticed a huge decoupling of people’s interest in crypto — which surged through social media and Google searches — amid the volatility fears surrounding the crypto markets. He also opined that as the halving nears, the greed aspect of the F&G Index seems to have increased quite exponentially, adding that this phenomenon can largely be attributed to the aforementioned event.Similarly, David Waslen, the CEO of HedgeTrade, a blockchain-based forecasting platform, believes that with the halving just a day away, Bitcoin is hovering in the neutral zone of the fear and greed index, coming off a long bearish stretch in the excessive fear zone. He added: “With record-high exchange volumes and all the money pouring into stablecoins (that could easily move into Bitcoin), this neutral phase may not last long.”The aforementioned sentiment is also echoed by Jeffrey Liu Xun, the CEO of XanPool, a peer-to-peer fiat gateway, who opined that while BTC’s Fear and Greed Index has been exhibiting neutral signs, the greed element seems to be taking over and increasing quite rapidly. Xun further said: “The F&G Index just swung from ‘extreme fear’ into the neutral territory and seems to be gathering steam towards the ‘Extreme greed’ territory.”Bitcoin’s halving is a fundamental event that most people from within the crypto community look forward to every four years, as it directly relates to the supply and demand of the premier crypto asset. And while the halving does not always have a direct relation with the Fear and Greed Index for BTC, it certainly has an effect on the cryptocurrency’s hash rate 100% of the time. This is because, after the event, block-reward sizes become smaller, which leads to a drastic increase in mining efficiency-related requirements. To get a more holistic view of how the halving will impact Bitcoin’s hash rate, Cointelegraph reached out to Lennix Lai, the director of financial markets at crypto trading platform OKEx. In his view:“In the short term, we may see some miners being unable to continue in the game. This means that the hashrate has the potential to go lower. However, with enhanced equipment and miners becoming more efficient, hashrate will gradually pick up again.”Similarly, Marie Tatibouet, the CMO of Gate.io, a Bitcoin exchange platform, pointed out that if one were to go by previously recorded data, Bitcoin halving events have traditionally been followed by a gradual increase in the network’s hash rate — only to dip once again three months after the event. She further said: “The hash rate also surged at a rapid pace after the second halving in 2017. If we buy some of these data trends, I believe the hash rate will increase in the one month window after the halving.”Lastly, a number of experts also tend to agree with the notion that a rise in the hash rate will most likely be witnessed in the near future since a large number of BTC miners may have to start consolidating their resources in order to stay afloat within this space. Not only that, but it is also entirely possible that the day-to-day workings of this burgeoning sector may become defined by the activities of a fair few individuals or groups who own sizeable rigs and have the necessary capital to weather the imminent threat of reduced block rewards.As the reduction in Bitcoin’s block reward quotient will become apparent immediately — i.e., the amount of BTC received per block will drop from 12.5 to 6.25. This reduction, in Lai’s opinion, will most likely force smaller-scale miners to potentially go out of business and lead to an increased amount of sell-off pressure, which, in turn, may result in the crypto market turning bearish in the short term. However, in the longer term, Lai believes that BTC’s price will rebound because, from a macroeconomic perspective, BTC has begun proving itself as a safe-haven asset.Also, following the halving, if Bitcoin’s hash rate falls, then historical data seems to point to the fact that the currency’s price will most likely follow suit. In this regard, looking at data from 2012 and 2016, the premier crypto asset’s price rallied before each event and corrected itself shortly after. Similarly, in both cases, the medium-term saw BTC’s value rise by a whopping 10,000% in 2012 and then again by 2,500% in 2016.Xun, too, believes that in the short-term, a price dump may occur. In this regard, he clarified: “I see a local top occurring on the halvening date + - 2 days or so. And then the price trading lower than that for a short term period.” However, Kade Almendinger, a co-host of the Dark Side of the HODL Moon podcast, firmly believes that any potential monetary upsurges in BTC’s future may have already been factored into the currency’s existing value. He added:“We already saw a price run-up from April 28th to the 30th and then a sell-off correction later on the 30th of April. It came up again on May 6th and seems to have some support at $9,200. The bulls will likely push it higher pre-halving and I wouldn’t be surprised to see $10K plus BTC prior to the halving, with a modest sell-off and price correction post halving.”Considering the post-halving surges that followed the first two halvings, it would not be surprising to see a similar growth spurt in BTC’s near-term future. However, this time, owing to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, experts are eagerly waiting to see how the current situation affects the premier crypto’s financial future — especially as the virus continues to bring stock markets all over the world down to their knees. On the subject, Tatibouet stated:“I believe the COVID 19 pandemic has a great role to play in the larger scheme of things. Initially, it created some anxiety in the investor community and then eventually it stabilized. We have seen BTC trading on our platform increase after the COVID-19 hit China. I think the rise in Bitcoin trading volume, in general, is responsible for Bitcoin’s recent recovery and eventually its stability.”Similarly, Lai, too, believes that the current crypto market looks cautiously bullish despite the COVID-19 crisis plunging the global economy into a massive depression. In this regard, he added: “Most central banks have been considering alternative non-currency asset classes. However, they have their limitations when it comes to hedging the risks initiated by COVID-19-induced global lockdown, especially in the equity market.”In order to evaluate whether BTCs current financial momentum is sustainable or if it’s just a by-product of widespread market fear of missing out, or FOMO, it is worth considering the fact that the ongoing optimism surrounding the industry might be because the Bitcoin network has matured over the past decade — so much so that it now supports hundreds of exchanges, futures markets, lending programs, wallets, swap platforms, as well as various blockchain-based financial applications. In this regard, Waslen added:“People are bullish for sure, and maybe some of that is based on hype. But it’s also because of all the building that’s been going on plus the fact that Bitcoin has the largest, decentralized computer in the world providing security for its global users. For 10 years, it’s been going strong, has not been hacked, and has exceeded the ROI of every other asset (over the decade).”Lastly, Gauthier believes that the pandemic has caused traditional finance players to re-evaluate their long-held beliefs in such a way that many mainstream corporate entities have started looking at Bitcoin as a legitimate store of value — something, he believes, has helped create positive momentum for the premier crypto asset.Most crypto pundits are of the opinion that BTC’s financial potential cannot be ascertained accurately in the short-term due to a number of technical variables that are difficult to evaluate. Additionally, with Bitcoin’s current value hovering at levels much lower than what they were back in 2017, many of the “get-rich-quick type individuals” have largely disappeared from this space, thus leaving the ecosystem largely in the hands of those who are interested in making use of the digital potential of BTC to create novel financial platforms, as well as other similar offerings. Speaking on Bitcoin’s future, Adam Traidman, the CEO and co-founder of BRD, a cryptocurrency wallet provider, told Cointelegraph:“Warren Buffet won’t invest in Bitcoin because it’s too volatile, yet look at oil. The old ways of thinking are behind us. Compared to a majority of other assets, if you held Bitcoin throughout this year, you would’ve ended up towards the top. There’s a reason that a lot of long-time Bitcoin enthusiasts say that no matter what happens with volatility, at the end of the day, if you believe in the future of Bitcoin, any of these prices are a great deal.”"

In the futures market, traders use debt or leverage to trade with ...",,"As the Bitcoin (BTC) price abruptly dropped from $9,500 to $8,100, some traders on Binance claimed that their winning short trades were unfairly cut short. ","A trader named AthenaBank wrote on May 10:Deleverage? Binance close my short after I make 7 times my investment. What's going on? Where is my short? The BTC dropped to $8,000. Who pays the difference?But, the closure of the shorts was systematic and the process is called auto-deleveraging.In the futures market, traders use debt or leverage to trade with larger capital. Binance, as an example, allows a trader to use 125x of their initial capital. If a user has $1,000, the user can trade with up to $125,000.The role of a cryptocurrency exchange is to match orders between buyers and sellers. Hence, if trader A wants to short Bitcoin at $9,500, the role of the exchange is to find trader B that wants to buy BTC at the same price.A problem occurs when the Bitcoin price sees an abrupt increase or decrease in price. More traders rush to short BTC, and as the price declines rapidly, it creates an imbalance in the orderbook.When there is a big orderbook disparity, it can potentially cause a cascade of liquidations and cause the price of Bitcoin to plunge to abnormal prices. Such a price trend was seen on March 12, when the price of BTC crashed to as low as $3,600 on BitMEX.Major Bitcoin futures exchanges like BitMEX and Binance Futures use a system called auto-deleveraging to ensure their orderbook remains balanced. When the insurance fund is not enough to cover for liquidations, then other trades are cut short to cover for the remaining liquidations.Example of an auto-deleverage Bitcoin trade. Source: AthenaBankBinance Futures says:When a trader’s account size goes below 0, the Insurance Fund is used to cover the losses. However, in some exceptionally volatile market environments, the Insurance Fund may be unable to handle the losses, and open positions have to be reduced to cover them.In such a case, highly leveraged trades are likely to have their trades sized down first. Traders that use 75 to 125x are often in the top percentile and are first to have their trades cut in abnormally volatile market conditions.One trader explained:There is a light for the auto deleverage queue on the trading page when you're in a position. Deleverage is used as insurance for long liquidation in this case to help sustain cascading liquidations and resulting in mega dumps. High leveraged trades are usually first.Auto-deleveraging happens quite frequently in the cryptocurrency market because Bitcoin is significantly more volatile than most traditional assets.The tendency of the price of Bitcoin to sway in a direction rapidly within a short period of time makes it challenging for exchanges to maintain balance in the market.Cointelegraph reached out to Binance for a comment but did not receive a response by press time."

4,https://cointelegraph.com,,Bitcoin Pre-Halving Hash Rate Volatility to Shake Up the Mining Sector,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-pre-halving-hash-rate-volatility-to-shake-up-the-mining-sector,"As the halving approaches, Bitcoin's hash rate sees major volatility. So 
what does it mean, exactly? 26766 Total views. 109 Total shares.",,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) mining hash rate is seeing major volatility ahead of the halving event, scheduled for May 12, as the mining sector is preparing for a major reshuffle. On May 3, the hash rate set a new all-time high, or ATH, of more than 142 exahashes per second, beating its previous record reached in March 2020.","The metric has not been only going upwards, however. Experts describe the hash rate during the early months of 2020 as “incredibly volatile,” as it ranged from around 70 EH/s to 120 EH/s. Chances are, the hash rate will start falling once the halving happens, but will soon start bouncing back — here’s why. Why does hash rate even matter? It is the simplest way to evaluate the network’s health. Put simply, hash rate is the amount of computing power miners are using to validate the Bitcoin blockchain. The more power, the more difficult it is for bad actors to compromise the blockchain’s security. A higher hash rate also means greater competition among miners to validate new blocks, as it increases the difficulty of mining new coins.Last month proved to be the most volatile period for BTC’s hash rate this year. Things were largely shaken up by the so-called “Black Thursday,” the day Bitcoin’s price bled by nearly 50%. The drop happened on March 12, just four days after the hash rate reached an ATH of 123 EH/s, triggering a major sell-off on trading platforms worldwide. This, in turn, affected the hash rate’s performance. By March 25, the metric fell down to just 76 EH/s, its lowest level since September 2019.A volatile Bitcoin price is one of the key factors behind the “incredibly volatile” metric, Pankaj Balani, CEO at crypto derivatives platform Delta Exchange, confirmed in a conversation with Cointelegraph. Black Thursday prompted a substantial amount of miners to unplug their equipment, Balani explained: “A price drop of this magnitude is likely to have seen numerous miners switch off operations — at least temporarily — as BTC mining suddenly became unprofitable. As the price of BTC dropped by 50%, miners saw their revenues shrink by a similar amount, with only the most efficient miners being able to absorb the cost. Whether these miners have been able to restart their operations or not remains in doubt.”Other possible causes include the omnipresent coronavirus pandemic. Balani explained that the rise of COVID-19 has forced many miners to either shut down or reorganize their operations, thereby contributing to the reduction of BTC’s hash rate. “If the pandemic has not reached its end by fall 2020 we should expect to see further volatility in Bitcoin hash rate and price,” he warned. Moreover, the Delta Exchange CEO suggested that the supply chain disruption caused by the global lockdown barred some miners from being able to switch to more sophisticated equipment that is required to compete in post-halving conditions. The halving will cut the block reward in half — meaning that miners will begin receiving 50% fewer BTC for verifying transactions, and will have to replace unprofitable units with more efficient equipment. According to Mark D’Aria, the CEO of Bitpro Consulting LLC, the hash rate has been so volatile because newer ASICs — units designed to mine cryptocurrency with industry-scale output — are continually improving in efficiency, while the BTC price has been generally fluctuating between $5000 and $10,000 for several years:“As the average unit becomes more efficient, it puts more pressure on the less efficient units. For example a year ago an [Bitmain Antminer] S9 could have turned a reasonable profit at $9,000/BTC, but at today’s rates, it may not be efficient enough to stay profitable at $9,000. So you’ve got miners turning marginally profitable equipment on and off more frequently.”The time might indeed have run out for the S9 series, as a recent report by cryptocurrency research firm TokenInsight showed. The unit’s profitability was around 35% in the early months of 2020 before plummeting into negative territory amid the March crypto crash, although it bounced back to roughly 20% last month. “The only way they may be profitable is if a miner finds extremely low electricity costs, which is challenging,” Alejandro De La Torre, vice president at major mining pool Poolin, explained to Cointelegraph.Related: Bitcoin Halving History: Hash Rate as a Clue to What Will HappenSo what will replace those failing machines? A next generation of ASICs, capable of producing 100–120 terahashes per second, has already been unveiled by mining hardware giants like MicroBT and Bitmain. Pankaj Balani described a fierce competition between the two:“Increasingly efficient miners are making their way to the market now, with both Bitmain and MicroBT racing to bring their miners to market in time for the halving. These include the AntMiner S17, S19 and S19 Pro models and the MicroBT WhatsMiner M30S — both touted to be the most profitable miners on the market.”Although some of the new devices are already being plugged in, they mostly won’t be shipped out until the halving. The hash rate is therefore likely to drop right after the event takes place. Marc Fresa, founder of United States-based company Asic.to, which specializes in producing firmware for mining machines, told Cointelegraph:“You can expect the hashrate to decrease as profitability for miners across the board are slashed. This result will cause the older generation miners to be unplugged unless they can find a new home with extremely cheap or free power. That being said historically just give it a little bit of time and the hashrate will be at a new all-time high. We can not forget that the next generation machines are just now starting to be plugged in and firmware optimization for the current generation makes them very competitive even post having.”Alejandro De La Torre shared a similar sentiment. “The addition of new, more powerful miners has caused volatility to the hash rate,” he told Cointelegraph. Nonetheless, another hash rate ATH may be on the cards before the halving takes effect, De La Torre added. He highlighted three factors behind his forecast, namely that these are the last days for miners to make use of 12.5 Bitcoin rewards; the increased BTC price further adding to their profits; and a rise in transaction volumes, which will increase the fees miners get for each verified block.As for the global distribution of the hash rate after the halving, the situation is less clear. As recently reported by Cointelegraph, 40 mining operations in China had to close shop due to the March crash making S9-based companies unprofitable, with F2pool reporting that roughly 2.3 million miners had gone offline since March 10. So does that mean China could be dethroned as the cryptocurrency mining king? Bitcoin Mining Map, launched by the Cambridge University’s Centre for Alternative Finance earlier this week and showing the average monthly hash rate produced by country, suggests otherwise. It confirms that China is still largely dominant when it comes to mining, with 65% of the global total (the U.S. comes second with just 7.24%). Although China appears invincible with these statistics, the situation could soon change due to the halving and COVID-19 pandemic, as Balani argued:“Relatively low electricity prices throughout China have for years resulted in high levels of mining activity in China relative to elsewhere. Whilst this has worked to facilitate incomparable growth throughout the Chinese mining sector, it has also resulted in the proliferation of relatively inefficient mining infrastructure. With only efficient miners to be left behind now; it remains to be seen whether Chinese miners are able to keep up or not.”Balani continued that COVID-19 has severely affected the Chinese mining industry, but with that being said, he concluded, “We can predict further difficulties for all regions in the months to come.” De La Torre, however, suggested that Xinjiang — China’s top mining region — will indeed remain dominant: “The rainy season is just beginning and all the new mining equipment is manufactured in China.” Nonetheless, De La Torre noted, mining will continue to expand across the globe: “The reason being that miners now have various new ways to finance their operations,” while miners in the west have found cheaper electricity sources. “This trend will continue into the future,” he claimed, asserting that the mining industry is poised for some big changes."

Halving",https://cointelegraph.com/news/the-market-perceives-positive-sentiment-heading-into-the-2020-bitcoin-halving,"As Bitcoin (BTC) fast approaches its scheduled third halving, several

this ...",,"As Bitcoin (BTC) fast approaches its scheduled third halving, several metrics are now pointing toward positive market sentiment going into this most-anticipated event.","The perpetual funding rate serves as a useful indicator to gauge overall market sentiment. When the rate is positive, long positions periodically pay short positions and vice versa. Funding rates also tend to correlate with market sentiment, meaning that when the market is strongly bullish or bearish, funding rates tend to be positive or negative, respectively.The perpetual funding rate turned extremely negative during the Black Thursday market crash and crept back up to near-positive territory following the market crash, but it faced difficulty breaking to the positive side. The funding rate has weakly broken to the positive side during the first week of May while the Bitcoin network is gearing toward the third halving.Traders are consistently buying put options, as indicated by the put–call ratio rising since the market crash in mid-March and reaching a three-month high. Generally speaking, a rising put–call ratio indicates bearish sentiment in the options market. However, I hold the same perspective as Matt D’Souza, a hedge fund manager at Blockchain Opportunity Fund, which is that a constantly rising put–call ratio could be interpreted as a bullish indicator, thus acting as a contrarian view that traders are bullish for Bitcoin’s price and are holding Bitcoin and buying put options as hedges and insurances rather than speculation. As D’Souza said:“A rising put to call means many investors are buying downside protection. I love it as a contrarian indicator. So when put/call gets extreme or greater than usual, I actually get bullish because I take a contrarian position. I like to do the opposite of the herd. This is most importantly, take the other side for the most part when the ratios go too far in either direction.”The Bitcoin options flows can also confirm the belief that traders are buying options for the purpose of hedging, as there are more put buyers than put sellers in volume. If there is significant volume on the sell side, it reflects market participants’ concern about a potential market downturn.The Spent Output Profit Ratio, or SOPR, has broken and stayed above 1 as the market recovers from the Black Thursday crash.During March and April, values of SOPR above 1 were rejected, indicating a micro bear market. However, as the market approaches the May Bitcoin halving, we have seen SOPR values from the last week of April break 1 and reject going below 1.People, in general, are much more comfortable selling when they are in profit. When the market sentiment turns positive, people are reluctant to sell at a loss, thus an SOPR below 1 is rejected.As the world is fighting off the COVID-19 pandemic, it is also worth considering this global situation. We believe there is still significant market uncertainty ahead, especially going into the halving, which has coupled with that uncertainty.The market data points toward a positive but relatively weak sentiment, possibly indicating the market is cautiously optimistic about the current market structure.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.Johnson Xu is a devoted fintech professional with a background in finance and computer science and with substantial exposure to the cryptocurrency/blockchain industry.

This news was made available as part of an effort to drive crypto adoption in the hyperinflation-stricken country. ","Earlier today, Panama-based cryptocurrency merchant-gateway startup Cryptobuyer announced a partnership with Venezuelan company Mega Soft, which processes payments for thousands of local businesses via its platform called “Merchant Server.” The platform will now accept Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Dash (DASH), Litecoin (LTC), Tether (USDT) and dozens of other cryptocurrencies along with fiat, thereby adopting the technology on a national scale. Merchants that are paid with cryptocurrencies will have the possibility to instantly settle them to fiat or to store them for future purposes.Venezuela’s hyperinflation rate hit 10 million percent at some point last year, making it extremely inefficient to store VES, the local sovereign currency, for longer than one day. Although inflation has since slowed, cryptocurrencies remain a much more stable medium of exchange in Carcas, local reports show.“This is real financial inclusion,” Farias said of the new partnership in an email sent to Cointelegraph, arguing that cryptocurrencies are even more convenient for everyday shopping in countries like Venezuela than foreign fiat currencies: “The use of cash like US Dollars is complicated by many times not having the necessary change at the time of a purchase forcing people to buy more products than they need is here where the use of cryptocurrencies is much more versatile in countries where payment systems are inefficient”Farias noted that Cryptobuyer’s solution has already been in use in “more than 400 stores” in Venezuela, including a Burger King branch in the Sambil area of Caracas. The companies will now start activating the crypto-friendly system in thousands of “Merchant Sever”-affiliated businesses. “We must have most of them operational by June,” Farias told Cointelegraph.When asked whether the new system supports Petro, a controversial cryptocurrency championed by President Nicholas Maduro, the Cryptobuyer CEO replied that it is not something they have contemplated thus far."

Barrier",https://cointelegraph.com/news/miners-in-europe-gear-up-for-bitcoin-halving-but-energy-costs-still-a-barrier,"While it may be a stressful event for holders of Bitcoin, it is even more 
so for those that have made it their business to produce Bitcoin: the 
miners.",,"As the Bitcoin halving approaches, miners across the world have been forced to make adjustments in order to adapt. The halving will see Bitcoin’s (BTC) production cost double overnight, but luckily the cryptocurrency has been reacting positively to the upcoming event.","While almost everyone in crypto is bullish about the event, and with good reason, the path ahead for Bitcoin’s price post-halving is unknown, especially given the coronavirus pandemic and the massive wave of unemployment that has come with it. While it may be a stressful event for holders of Bitcoin, it is even more so for those that have made it their business to produce Bitcoin: the miners.For Bitcoin miners in countries with subsidized electricity such as Venezuela or low electricity prices such as China, where most of the hashing power on the Bitcoin network resides, a production cost increase can prove manageable. Even those with medium-range prices but geared with the latest mining equipment are prepared. But for those in the higher electricity brackets, such as the ones found in Europe, their operations may rely heavily on Bitcoin’s post-halving price action.So, here is how miners in Europe, where electricity prices are some of the highest in the world, have prepared for the halving.While some may indeed be forced to shut down if the price doesn’t go their way, miners have known about the halving for a long time and have been able to prepare for the event. According to Jake Stott, a member of the founding board of dGen — a Berlin-based think tank that recently surveyed many key European players in the industry — miners have had the opportunity to upgrade:“The great thing about the Bitcoin Halvening is that it is a known revenue shock. Miners will have been preparing for this day since the last halvening for years ago. Upgrading to the latest machines, newest infrastructure, sourcing cheaper power sources and pooling together with the right group are all key. Miners are well prepared for all scenarios regarding the Bitcoin price.”While having the most up-to-date equipment and infrastructure is important, it will only do so much. Youssef El Manssouri, the co-founder and CEO of Sesterce — a French company providing mining services — told Cointelegraph:“It is very complicated to anticipate what will happen after the halving, the most logical thing seems to be to prepare the worst case scenario by trying to negotiate the electrical contracts and renewing the fleet of machines. This is what we have been doing at Sesterce for several months in anticipation.”Equipment upgrades and cheap electricity sourcing through partnerships are the first steps for miners in Europe, but there are also other solutions that can prepare them for the volatility that may grab hold after the halving, including hedging strategies and credit accruement. According to Antoni Trenchev, the co-founder of crypto credit issuer Nexo, this is already happening in the region. He told Cointelegraph:“There is a growing array of financial instruments available for digital asset management and with that — a set of services specifically catering to miners’ needs. Notable examples of these center on miners locking in an average selling price into the future or insuring against hashrate changes via upcoming hashrate derivatives. Miners form a sizable portion of Nexo’s client base and many of them opt for our standard crypto-backed credit line to maintain and grow their operations or cash in on newly minted BTCs.”Although miners in Europe are doing their best to cope with the halving, the event brings the long-term viability of mining under question. Can the activity be sustained in Europe? Will co-location become the norm? Or can companies and governments in the region begin to compete with other countries where mining is becoming a full-blown industry? El Manssouri believes that Europe can be competitive:“We are seeing more and more European countries understanding mining and the underlying sovereignty issues. We have large power plants in Europe that are producing a lot of losses and a lot of lost revenue, and it's up to us to make sure that we make up for those losses in the mining and power industry so that in the long term Europe can do well.”Leveraging excess power and renewable energy may be the answer for the European mining industry, and this is something that is already happening, according to Whit Gibbs, the host of the mining-centric podcast Hashr8. But there may also be an answer in different forms of mining other than Bitcoin. Gibbs told Cointelegraph:“Despite not getting as much attention nowadays, parts of Europe are still great for mining. Iceland and Sweden seem to be the most popular facility locations. I've heard there are German power producers who have begun mining with their excess energy, much like producers in the States are doing. Interestingly enough, some of them are not exclusively mining Bitcoin but are outfitting GPU and FPGA facilities to capitalize on more speculative mining plays.”There are also other advantages that extend far beyond electricity cost and quality. When it comes to a nascent industry such as cryptocurrency mining, regulation is a decisive factor. A ban on crypto mining can put miners out of business in a blink of an eye, so the government’s outlook on mining and cryptocurrencies as a whole is quite important. According to Gibbs, “Europe is far more receptive to bitcoin and crypto, than other places where energy is cheaper and this may be a decisive factor.”In fact, regulation and political stability have been the main strengths cited by miners and other industry players that Cointelegraph spoke too in the region. Some believe this factor is so important that it can even make Europe one of the most attractive places for industrial miners, as Stott told Cointelegraph:“I would say Europe is one of the most viable markets long term for the mining industry. Political stability is key to this industry and as larger and larger sums of money are invested into the space many will look at Europe for their mines.”Political stability and a generally positive outlook on crypto are great, but they are somewhat worthless if they don’t translate into palpable benefits for miners. Luckily for those that are pursuing mining in Europe, initiatives such as the tax breaks introduced by Portugal for cryptocurrency issuers are beginning to pop up. Stott added:“It is clear that this kind of initiative can only encourage people in this direction, Portugal seems to have a more innovation-oriented policy recently and we can only congratulate them on this, but in order to be a truly competitive choice in the eyes of large mining infrastructures, it will be essential to be able to offer multi-MegaWatt contracts at prices as competitive as in Texas or China.”So, from alternative electricity sourcing to government incentives, Europe has a lot of positive factors that can be easy to overlook, which means miners should be able to survive a bearish post-halving Bitcoin. But the issue with the cost of electricity is still a fundamental barrier. Gibbs also noted that the steep prices don’t apply just to electricity:“Europe is still cost-prohibitive for mining in most places, according to my sources. While there may be pockets of opportunity, it is difficult to find cheap, sustainable power. There's not the widespread excess production we see in the U.S., CIS countries, and China. Equipment pricing also skews high, especially for GPUs.”While the most obvious answer for miners may lie in countries such as China or Russia where electricity is cheaper, other alternatives are becoming increasingly attractive. As Matt D’Souza, the CEO of the United States-based mining company Blockware Solutions, told Cointelegraph, this is the case with the U.S., which has found a perfect balance between low-to-medium electricity prices and political and regulatory stability, adding:“The U.S. has excellent stability and redundancy. Switzerland had a drought in 2017/2018 and the hydro power rates increased unsustainably for one of my large clients. Areas with cheaper power are more governmentally unstable and uncertain. The U.S. has certainty with the government, regulation, and electricity rates, exceptional redundancy with internet and power. The U.S. is the most energy abundant country in the world.”When piecing all the factors together, the mining industry in Europe has a bumpy road ahead. But if the right choices are made, it can become very competitive. Nevertheless, it still has to catch up to other countries such as China or even the U.S., which is beginning to look like the most attractive option for large-scale miners.Related: BTC Miners Expect Bitcoin Price to Surpass $12K After Reward Halving"

set to redenominate its fiat currency, removing four zeros to create a ...",,"Ravaged by crippling hyperinflation, Iran’s Parliament has sanctioned the redenomination of its fiat — the rial — by replacing it with a new currency called the toman. According to the plan, each toman will be worth 10,000 rials.","The redenomination plan effectively removes four place values (four zeros) from the Iranian national currency as part of efforts to kickstart an economic recovery from the country. It is a move that echoes steps taken by other countries like Venezuela and Zimbabwe amid huge inflation.With the United States exiting its nuclear deal with Iran and reintroducing sanctions, the country’s economic situation has been in a tailspin. Virtually frozen from the international scene, Iran has been facing a severe liquidity crunch and foreign exchange shortage.Typically, people living in countries suffering from an economic crisis turn to cryptocurrency not only as a way of preserving wealth but also as a means of carrying out international transactions. Iran’s case is not dissimilar, with Bitcoin’s (BTC) price even rising to a hefty 300% premium on peer-to-peer exchanges like LocalBitcoins.In May 2018, U.S President Donald Trump exited the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action — commonly known as the Iran nuclear deal — and reimposed sanctions on Tehran. This decision put enormous pressure on the country’s already fragile economic situation. Commenting on the impact of U.S. sanctions on Iran, Babak Behboudi, the CEO of blockchain innovation firm Synchronium remarked:“The U.S. sanctions are the major problem facing the Iranian economy in recent years, which have paralyzed a significant part of the economy. In an economy like Iran, where a significant part of the economy is still state-owned, such sanctions prevent economic stability and growth.”While the deal was in place, Iran’s economy was open to the international scene, benefitting especially from increased oil exports. Indeed, the country’s president, Hassan Rouhani, ran his 2017 election campaign based on programs that would leverage the opportunities afforded by the accord with the U.S.However, the rial was evidently deteriorating even before the U.S. repudiated the nuclear deal, with the country’s inflation rate more than tripling between 2017 and 2018. Indeed, the lifting of sanctions in 2016 did little to spur any growth in real gross domestic product. Between 2017 and 2018, protests broke out in many Iranian cities with people voicing their dissatisfaction over the rising cost of living among other grievances. By August 2018, Iran’s rial had lost more than 80% of its value in barely a year.Faced with a rapidly declining economic situation, the central bank began placing restrictions on forex, a move meant to checkmate the foreign exchange black market. The escalating rial devaluation meant the emergence of an expanding bid-ask spread on Nima — the country’s secondary forex market.At the start of May 2020, the bid-ask spread — the difference between the buying and selling rate for forex — stood at about 9,000 rials. Exporters of non-essential goods in Iran use Nima, and the widening bid-ask spread on the market means having to liquidate overseas earnings at a much cheaper rate that, in turn, harms the profitability of such ventures.The existence of a secondary forex market is in part due to the inability of the authorities to create a unified exchange rate. The government’s failure in this regard meant that a greater percentage of forex deals moved to the black market where participants could speculate on the unending volatility of the rial–dollar exchange rate.At the time of writing, while the official government rate is about 42,000 rials to $1, the black market rate is almost four times higher — with $1 selling for 163,500 rials. Indeed, the Nima rate has also begun to approach the black market figures with $1 worth 157,320 rials.Iran’s economic situation has also not been helped by the outbreak of COVID-19 with the country’s currency going into a deeper dive since February. The country has been hit hard by the deadly coronavirus with over 6,500 deaths from about 104,000 cases since the first confirmed infection in mid-February. According to an April report from the World Bank due to the dwindling oil revenues, the country’s GDP growth will continue to lag. The report reads:“Persistence of lower oil prices and export volumes (e.g., due to a significant decline in China’s oil demand) would result in a substantially larger overall shock and fiscal deficit in 2020/21.”On Monday, May 4, 2020, Iran’s Parliament authorized the redenomination of the country’s fiat, eliminating four zeros and replacing the rial with the toman. According to the plan, each toman will be equivalent to 10,000 rials. The move, more than a year in the making, began with a draft bill prepared by the governor of the Central Bank of Iran. Opting for a redenomination also marks a departure from the usual approach of Iran devaluing its currency — which happened about 3,500 times since 1971.Some commentators like government spokesperson, Ali Rabiei, have said the move will help to simplify financial transactions in the country. However, critics of the plan believe it does nothing to solve the fundamental issues affecting the economy.In a conversation with Cointelegraph, Ali Beikverdi, the CEO of crypto exchange deployment service bitHolla, remarked that Iranians have already been redenominating the country’s fiat to suit different purposes. According to Beikverdi: “Currency denomination in any country doesn’t solve any financial or economic issues. The only thing it does is inflation. However, I must say in Iran this has been a matter of debate for quite some time.” Explaining the confusion caused by multiple rial benchmarks in the country, Beikverdi added:“While banknotes use Iranian rial, people already drop one zero and call it toman. So, one toman = 10 rial today. To add more to that confusion, people even drop three more zeros from toman to make the numbers smaller, and that is very confusing if you are not familiar with it. So, the currency denomination has already happened among people for simplicity, and this is nothing new.”With multiple forex benchmarks existing within the country, the government’s redenomination plan might struggle to achieve the desired results especially given the historical precedence surrounding such actions. For Behboudi, it is still too early to determine the effectiveness of the government’s plan, arguing that taking four zeros of a currency will not have much effect in itself:“Such an effort can be a good small step for a serious, wider, and more effective series of reforms, including well-planned privatization of the economy, decreasing the monetary system expenses, and ease of banking operations.”In a conversation with Cointelegraph, a spokesperson for Iran’s Ministry of Finance derided the plan to create a new fiat currency for the country, declaring:“Everybody in the country knows that redenomination has no effect on inflation. Most economists think it is not a sustainable time for redenomination. Due to coronavirus and oil prices, the revenue of the government has fallen sharply, and at the same time, the costs have grown. So, we expect high inflation.”Amid the backdrop of the plans to revamp Iran’s currency, Cointelegraph reached out to Areatak, a blockchain solutions provider based in Tehran. Back in May 2019, Cointelegraph reported that Areatak — in partnership with the Informatics and Services Corporation of Iran’s central bank — was developing Borna, a national blockchain project aimed at transforming the country’s banking and financial sector. In a message to Cointelegraph, Areatak CEO Saeed Khoshbakht revealed the latest updates with the project, stating:“Borna infrastructure and platform is passing the first phase of test and it will be ready soon to launch. As mentioned in the whitepaper, Borna can host central bank cryptocurrency, and maybe it is used in this economic evolution. But the decision is for the central bank and ISC.”While the government tries to solve the growing inflation problem, crypto stakeholders in Iran say the situation favors a more broad-based adoption of cryptocurrencies. Indeed, high ranking officials within the country’s government and military have called for the use of digital currencies to evade crippling U.S. sanctions. Commenting on the growing adoption levels of crypto in Iran, Khoshbakht remarked:“If we analyze the adoption of cryptocurrency usage in the world we find two types of countries are in front of the list. Countries with a lack of digital payment systems and countries with high inflation. Because of High inflation in Iran, people don’t trust to national currency and try to buy everything such as real estate, gold, stock, other currencies like the U.S. dollar and cryptocurrency.”Tehran’s stance on crypto mining has noticeably softened with the authorities allowing Bitcoin miners to set up shop in the country. As previously reported by Cointelegraph, Iran has issued about 1,000 licenses to crypto miners in the country.Related: Five Countries Where Crypto Regulation Changed the Most in 2019Earlier in May, the country’s Ministry of Industry, Mining and Trade also gave the go-ahead to Turkish crypto mining firm iMiner to establish a 6,000-rig facility in the Semnan province. Iran has also given tax breaks to crypto miners on the condition that they repatriate all foreign earnings. According to Behboudi, crypto is primed for even greater adoption in Iran, adding: “Mining, holding and trading of cryptocurrencies, especially BTC and ETH, is widely adopted in Iran. I’m sure in next months we will see more investment by the public, especially the middle class, in cryptocurrencies like BTC.”For Beikverdi, the economic crisis in the country is only setting the stage for more people to choose cryptocurrencies. “Once you see your currency loses its value more than five times in about two years, as an investor, you seek alternatives as a store of value,” remarked the bitHolla CEO.Indeed, Bitcoin P2P trading data shows significantly higher BTC premiums in Iran since the start of 2020. On LocalBitcoins, Bitcoin has steadily sold for between 300% and 400% of the global average spot price.For example, while Bitcoin traded at around $7,800 in early January, the quoted price for BTC on LocalBitcoins was the equivalent of over $25,000. While BTC recovered from the Black Thursday flash crash of March 12, the cryptocurrency seemingly traded for $21,000 while the global average hovered above $5,200."

On May 7, CNBC's Bitcoin baller, Brian Kelly, or BK, and CNBC's Fast Money traders discussed the potential impact of the billionaire investor’s Bitcoin news.Karen Finerman, co-founder and CEO of Metropolitan Capital Advisors and a CNBC Fast Money panelist, also believes that Jones is paving the way for more hedge funds and mainstream investors to get into Bitcoin. Finerman outlined that people will feel more safe buying Bitcoin now that Jones has invested in it:“Nobody wants to get outed having owned Bitcoin if it completely falls apart. But if you can say that Jones owns it also, maybe that gives you a little bit of cover.”Jones said that Bitcoin reminds him of the crucial role that gold played in the economic crisis of the 1970s. According to CNBC's BK, both Bitcoin and gold can do well in the current economic environment due to their common features, like a capped supply. However, the CNBC Bitcoin analyst says that Bitcoin will play a bigger role in the current environment due its digital and mobile nature. Kelly also outlined that Bitcoin has a “much higher upside” and a better risk-to-reward.On May 2, major United States’ crypto exchange, Coinbase, published a report arguing that the pandemic-fueled crisis will make Bitcoin superior to gold."

with an in-depth look at the state of the blockchain industry.",,"“Cryptopia: Bitcoin, Blockchains and the Future of the Internet” is filmmaker Torsten Hoffmann’s follow up to his award-winning 2015 documentary “Bitcoin: The End of Money As We Know It.”","His first film looked at the history (and failings) of money and the financial system, and how Bitcoin was poised to revolutionize and solve many of its problems. Now, Cryptopia brings us up to date with the current state of play in the world of cryptocurrency and blockchain.The documentary is split into three acts.First we get an introduction to the fundamentals of Bitcoin, recapping the problems with traditional finance from the earlier film and highlighting Bitcoin’s initial stated purpose as peer-to-peer digital cash.Hoffmann talks about the benefits of Bitcoin with a veritable who’s who of industry figures, from Wences Casares, to Andreas M Antonopoulos and Laura Shin. We also see how and why big banks and governments have kicked back against the top-ranked cryptocurrency.We then move on to Bitcoin’s explosive growth in value since the first film, and repositioning from digital cash to digital gold.Hoffmann revisits Roger Ver, who had previously espoused Bitcoin as a fast and cheap method of moving money around the world, to investigate the block-size debate and eventual fork of Bitcoin Cash.He also speaks to Blockstream’s Samson Mow, for his take on the split, along with Charlie Lee, founder of Litecoin.The film then moves on to tackle the move from one blockchain to hundreds of blockchains. Hoffmann explains the concept of smart contracts and the Ethereum network, speaking to Vitalik Buterin, Vinny Lingham, and Tone Vays for their opinions, both positive and negative.Hoffmann takes a look at the initial coin offering, or ICO, phenomenon, bringing blockchains and currencies for every conceivable purpose, along with a wave of scams and fraudsters into the space.We see how big business and finance is co-opting blockchain technology, sometimes through the use of private centralized networks. We see the tokenization of traditional securities and totally new forms of assets.Through looking at the examples of the development of the motor car and the early internet, Hoffmann highlights similarities with today’s blockchain industry.He notes the rise of internet censorship in certain jurisdictions, and discusses the potential of blockchain to overcome this. We also consider the hegemony of tech giants and their control of our information and identities, looking at the possibilities of decentralization to overcome this.To round up, the film considers the possibilities of Decentralized Finance, or DeFi, although notes the controversy created following the DAO hack and subsequent rollback of the Ethereum blockchain.Hoffmann finally talks to Craig Wright (who behaves exactly as expected), touching on the Bitcoin Cash/Bitcoin SV split, and finally coming full circle to Satoshi’s disappearance and how this has worked for Bitcoin.The film has been professionally researched, shot, and put together. It assumes no prior knowledge of the subject, and follows a well structured story, making it accessible to all.Hoffmann’s style and delivery works well. He is authoritative yet friendly and open, being unafraid to challenge or poke fun at characters like Craig Wright, while always being even-handed and letting people speak.Sure, for those who are already invested in the industry and technology, there is little new to learn here, but for the uninitiated it is an excellent primer into a world that they may have heard about, but not really understand.For me personally, both this film and Hoffmann’s previous documentary made me incredibly proud to be part of this movement that is literally changing the world.My only criticism (and it is a minor one) is the song which plays out over the credits. Penned by Hoffmann himself and Malaysian singer, Prema Yin, it is a powerful, soulful number, rousing the spirits… until you listen more closely and realise that it is about cryptocurrency.To be fair, it is probably the least cringe-inducing cryptocurrency-related song that I’ve ever happened across, with intelligent lyrics and a proper decent tune. However this is a bit like being the least cancerous case of sunburn; the end consequence still consists of a pair of bright red cheeks.Sorry, and maybe this is just me, but the worlds of cryptocurrency and music (both of which I love individually) should never cross paths.However, I have no hesitation in recommending this film, which is available to stream now at cryptopiafilm.com for a price of just under 9 Australian dollars ($5.88)... and you can always make a cup of tea when it gets to the credits."

Source: TradingviewThis is a positive sign as it suggests that the bulls are in no hurry to book profits even at the current levels. Both moving averages are sloping up and the relative strength index has jumped above 80, which suggests that the bulls are in command but the BTC/USD pair looks overbought in the short-term.However, during strong bull runs, the markets can remain overbought for extended periods of time. Therefore, if the momentum sustains, the bulls might propel the pair above the symmetrical triangle. If successful, it would be a huge positive and could signal the possible start of an extended bull run.Alternatively, as the pair is overbought, a few days of consolidation or a minor correction cannot be ruled out from the current levels. If the bulls can sustain the price above $9,456.77 during the pullback, it will increase the possibility of a rally to $10,500 and then to the long-term downtrend line of the symmetrical triangle.The bears are likely to aggressively defend the zone between $10,500 and the downtrend line. Therefore, traders can tighten their stops if the pair starts to turn down from this zone. The first sign of weakness would be a break below $9,000. Therefore, the traders can trail the stops on the remaining long position to $9,000. Ether (ETH) bounced off the 20-day exponential moving average ($197) on May 7 and surged above the downtrend line.

With the Bitcoin halving less than two days away, volatility is likely to remain high. Therefore, in the next few days, traders might consider reducing their position size to keep their risk under control.Let’s see which five major cryptocurrencies offer attractive trading opportunities in the short-term.Bitcoin (BTC) broke above $9,200 on May 7 and hit a high of $10,058.52 on the same day. However, the $10,000 level proved to be a tough hurdle to cross.BTC-USD daily chart. Source: TradingviewAfter a minor correction on May 8 and 9, the BTC/USD pair plummeted on Saturday evening. The failure of the bulls to sustain the price above the previous resistance turned support at $9,200 could have led to selling by the bulls and initiation of short positions by the bears.The pair is currently trading inside an ascending channel where the price moves between the support line and the resistance line of the channel.$10,000 was close to the resistance line of the channel and from there the pair fell to $8,130.58, which is just above the support line of the channel. The strong bounce off this level, as seen from a long tail on the downside, is a positive sign.This suggests that the bulls did not panic but used the drop to the support line of the channel to buy. As long as the price remains inside the channel, the trend remains up and strong declines to the support line of the channel can be purchased.The first sign of weakness will be a drop below the channel. If that happens, long positions should be avoided until a new buy setup forms once again.BTC-USD 4-hour chart. Source: TradingviewThe 4-hour chart shows that the price dropped sharply within a short time frame (shown via the blue arrow on the chart). If the traders watch the 30-minute chart, they can see that the pair dropped from $9,566.52 to $8,130.58 within 30 minutes. Such a fall usually suggests liquidation by a large player.However, a positive is that the price recovered sharply from $8,130.58 and since then has been trading above the $8,500 levels. The recovery might face stiff resistance between $8,960.97 and $9,156.94, which corresponds to 50% and 61.8% Fibonacci retracement levels of this leg of the fall.If the pair bounces off $8,500, it could be a good entry point for the traders with a stop-loss placed just below the channel. The target objective on the upside is $9,600 and then $10,000.Conversely, if the next drop breaks below $8,500, traders can wait for the price to bounce off the support line of the channel, which can offer another buying opportunity with stops placed just below the channel.If the bears sink the price below the channel, it will be a huge negative as it will signal a possible change in trend. Therefore, bottom fishing should be avoided if the pair sustains below the channel.Although Ether (ETH) broke above the resistance line of the ascending channel on April 29 and 30, the bulls failed to sustain the higher levels. That resulted in a correction, which found support at the 20-day simple moving average ($204) on May 7.ETH-USD daily chart.

This suggests that the bears are attempting to make a comeback. The price should sustain below the channel to confirm a change in trend.Currently, the price has bounced off the support line of the ascending channel, which is a positive sign. This suggests that the bulls view the dips as a buying opportunity. The pair is likely to pick up momentum on a break above the downtrend line.ETH-USD 4-hour chart.

However, the bears are defending the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of the most recent leg of the decline, which is at $193.946.If the price turns down and plummets below $181.40, it will signal weakness and could result in a decline to $167 and below it to $150. Therefore, traders can initiate short positions below $181 with stops placed just above $194.Conversely, if the price turns up from the support line of the channel, it will signal buying on dips. Therefore, the bulls can buy the bounce off the channel with the stops placed at $181. If the bulls push the price above $197.821-$201.696 resistance, a rally to the downtrend line is possible.As the markets are volatile, traders should keep trailing their stops higher to reduce their risk.Tezos (XTZ) has been trading inside an ascending channel, which shows that the trend is up.

If the bulls can scale the price above $10.50, a rally to the resistance line of the channel at $11.30 is possible Therefore, traders can buy at $10.50 with a stop-loss below $9.60.On the other hand, if the pair dips below $9.63378, a drop to the support line of the channel is possible. A bounce of this level can also offer a low-risk buying opportunity.In this case, the stop-loss can be kept just below the channel because if the price sustains below the channel, a deeper correction is likely.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

16,https://cointelegraph.com,,Binance’s Mining Pool Could Disrupt the Entire Mining Industry,https://cointelegraph.com/news/binances-mining-pool-could-disrupt-the-entire-mining-industry,"Binance's entrance to the Bitcoin mining industry could create a great 
disparity for the Bitcoin community. 25376 Total views. 92 Total shares.",,"Binance has launched its own mining pool. This could spell bad news for miners, but probably not for the reason you’re thinking of. We’re all aware that Binance is continuing to extend its reach across the industry. The exchange’s purchase of CoinMarketCap for a reported $400 million signaled a bold step toward grabbing attention at the top of the crypto funnel, and its recent foray into mining just ahead of the 2020 halving shows that Binance is also interested in having influence at the source.","By all accounts, the company culture at Binance appears to be one of innovation and experimentation. CEO Changpeng Zhao is known to be approachable, and when good ideas come from within the company, it is able to exercise its enormous user base and war chest to enter new markets.To start with, the impact may be minimal. Binance’s initial target market will be miners who currently mine via the pools of other Chinese exchanges, such as Huobi and OKEx. There is fierce competition among those exchanges, and Binance launching a pool can be viewed through this lens. Binance even recruited directly from within Huobi as well as Bitmain to build its own pool’s business development team.It’s still early days, but the change in global hashrate distribution since Binance launched their pool tells the same story. Both Huobi and OKEx have lost a couple of percentage points of share in global hashrate. OKExPool and Huobi fell from 6.74% and 5.92%, respectively in April 2020 to 4.5% and 4.0% at the start of May, while Binance has attracted 4.5% of the network’s hashrate since launch.Meanwhile, established mining pools such as F2Pool and SlushPool have seen a growth in their share of hashrate during the same period.Up until now, Huobi and OKEx have predominantly used their pools as a way to attract exchange customers and support the services already on offer. While the older pools compete in a different way.Exchanges have massive reserves of Bitcoin and other liquid assets. They can operate at a loss, or close to cost, for extended periods of time.Edward Evenson from SlushPool and Ethan Vera from Luxor recently discussed this short-term advantage on the mining pool-focused HASHR8 Podcast. They posited that Binance’s pool will be used as a loss leader because it can afford to drive prices into the ground. As Edward Evenson, director of business development at SlushPool, said:“When you have 80,000 BTC on reserve, it becomes pretty easy to do whatever you want, especially when you’re vertically integrated across a bunch of different sectors of the industry.”Another reason why Binance may be focused on the Chinese mining market is that the majority of their team, their base and their connections are still mostly in China. It also makes good business sense: 65% to 70% of the global hashrate is in China.My concerns about this are not the typical narratives of over-centralization in China, as were recently expressed by Philip Salter from Genesis Mining. Indeed, as with the lessons everybody can learn from how Genesis handled their customers’ hashrate during the 2018 bear market, it’s much more important to focus on how you treat miners than where your company is based.I’m of an opinion similar to my Australian colleague, Thomas Heller — global business director at F2Pool — who was also part of the debate on the HASHR8 Podcast. He underlined:“The people who launched Bitcoin companies in Asia, such as pools or manufacturers, are Bitcoiners. They’re no different to Bitcoiners in Europe, North America or elsewhere.”Centralization is not a direct function of geographic location. Bitcoin doesn’t have a nationality, and pools don’t need to be labeled that way, either. As well as the increased development of farms in North America, large mining operators own and run machines in China, Russia, Kazakhstan and anywhere else with an abundance of low-cost energy — regardless of where the operators call home.The fundamental risks in China are outside the control of Bitcoiners, and it makes sense for everyone who wants to profit from contributing to the security of Bitcoin try to find ways to not be dependent on single points of failure. Economic factors such as the proliferation of hardware manufacturers and the logistical benefits of mining without having to export the machines halfway around the world will continue to support a disproportionate level of mining activity in that region.Bitcoin mining is a permissionless, antifragile system where the barriers to entry are low-cost electricity and access to efficient hardware.The future success of SBI’s focus on supplying hardware for large North American mining operations, or the potential entrance of even more well-equipped manufacturers like Samsung could change the mining landscape reasonably quickly. As low as electricity prices are in China now due to the lasting wet season, not even they can compete with some of the opportunities being explored by the likes of the Peter Theil-backed Texan’s Layer One or Greenidge Generation in New York.So the threat that Binance poses is not geographic. The real threat is whether this crypto behemoth will drag down the circular economy that currently exists for the established pools. SlushPool is the oldest pool, and it spends a large portion of its resources developing proposals such as Stratum V2. F2Pool had a loud voice in the SegWit 2x debates, and history suggests its founders came down on the right side of the argument. These kinds of pools make their profits by building up a reputation and experience in mining Bitcoin.The real risk is Binance turning mining into a short-term game where the only rules are how low you can offer fees. What will be the consequence if pools focusing on the long-term success of their miners get squeezed out? As with everything within the beautiful game that Satoshi created: The market will decide.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.Malcolm Cannon is the head of communications at F2Pool, which has been proudly securing Bitcoin and other proof-of-work blockchains since 2013. As one of the oldest mining pools, F2Pool is busy decentralizing its team and infrastructure. Cannon currently lives in Berlin, where he spent the past seven years leading startup growth teams through successful Seed and Series A fundraising rounds. "

He asserted that the benefits of “stable government, clear or non-threatening regulation, and high levels of ease in opening businesses” afford European miners a myriad of advantages and savings.Philip Salter, Genesis Mining’s head of operations agreed, stating:“Political stability reduces risks, and most of all electricity coming from renewable sources makes it, in the end, the best (aka cheapest) option.”However, GmbH’s Denis Rusinovich asserted that the United States offers miners greater options in terms of financial services when compared to Europe:“The biggest challenge for miners in Europe is poor local development of the ecosystem in contrast to the USA, where there is efficient development in trading, banking, structured products, and most importantly, financing options for miners,”When asked about the region’s prospects for weathering the impending halving, F2Pool’s second in command asserted that European miners are uniquely positioned to weather the halving through needing to invest in efficient technologies.“Mining farms in Europe have, on average, higher electrical costs so they tend to upgrade quickly, use firmware that is more efficient and generally have better-engineered data centers to take advantage of local weather,” he added.Rusinovich describes the halving as a “predefined trigger event,” arguing that miners across the world have been preparing by “[s]ourcing cheaper electricity, buying new more efficient hardware, and hedging financially for the upcoming risk.”Genesis Mining’s Salter predicted that the halving will have the same impact on all miners regardless of the jurisdiction in which they are based, stating:“Operating costs will be more important than before, so the miners that use cheap, renewable power sources will come out on top!”"

In the nearly 12 years since the publication of Satoshi Nakamoto’s famous white paper in 2008, Bitcoin has become the most well-known example of a cryptocurrency, and it is responsible for sparking the blockchain revolution.","More than half a million peer-to-peer transactions have been recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain, a public and verifiable distributed ledger. The network’s proof-of-work consensus algorithm confirms transactions and produces new blocks without needing a third party. Bitcoin is a revolutionary technology, but the network's massive energy footprint is comparable to the entire country of Ireland’s electricity consumption.Luckily, the blockchain ecosystem today is more diverse than ever: A growing number of blockchains are now based on proof-of-stake protocols, and they account for billions of United States dollars in value without a comparable environmental impact. Proof-of-stake blockchains have numerous advantages over proof-of-work: They are more scalable, less resource-intensive and they incentivize tokenholder participation in network security.Despite the wave of PoS blockchain innovation and the fundamental economic and incentive differences of these networks, many still assume that all blockchains are created equal and that PoS blockchains should still be taxed and regulated in the U.S. in the same manner as Bitcoin and PoW blockchains. This regulatory environment inhibits proof-of-stake innovation, pushing groundbreaking projects away from the U.S.In order to continue to drive the technological innovation and growth of this new financial ecosystem, tax laws need to be crafted with a deep understanding of the underlying technology and the incentives of these new networks to better reflect developments in blockchain technology that have come since Bitcoin’s introduction over a decade ago.The only guidance on cryptocurrency taxation from the Internal Revenue Service is in Notice 2014-21 and Notice 2014-16 IRB 938. This guidance mentions that mining rewards are treated as ordinary income at the date of receipt of the mining rewards. The issue is that these guidelines were written in 2014, preceding most proof-of-stake blockchains in existence today.Can taxation guidance drafted prior to the existence of PoS-based protocols adequately regulate the PoS industry? No. Proof-of-stake blockchains, and their economic incentives, are fundamentally different by design and should be regulated accordingly.The 2014 IRS guidance should not be confused with statutes passed by Congress or authoritative interpretations of law and regulations issued by federal courts. Well-intentioned entrepreneurs and innovators who are interested in building networks based on PoS technology would benefit greatly from regulatory clarity. And it’s critical that regulators understand the technological distinctions.In proof-of-work protocols, power-intensive mathematical problems need to be solved in order to create the next block. The miner that solves the mathematical problem and creates the next block also creates the block reward in the form of newly generated tokens — think of this as “network inflation.” In essence, miners are incentivized to put in a tremendous amount of computational work to potentially get rewarded with brand-new tokens.With proof-of-stake protocols, individuals “stake” — or show ownership of — the tokens by locking up a set amount of tokens for a set time period, and they are randomly selected to verify transactions on the protocol. Network participants are incentivized to maintain the integrity of transactions on the network by being rewarded with new tokens. This process is known as “forging” or “minting” in PoS protocols. The protocol has built-in mechanisms to penalize anyone who falsely or negligently verifies transactions by “slashing” this activity, meaning the individual loses a portion of their staked tokens.Proof-of-stake protocols have a built-in inflation mechanism that increases the supply of coins. New coins are distributed proportionally to those that have been staked. If everyone were to participate in staking, everyone’s “stake” would remain the same because the new supply is distributed pro rata. Anyone who does not stake is not helping secure the network and is effectively punished with token dilution. Staking, by design, encourages every owner of tokens to participate in the network. In proof-of-work protocols such as Bitcoin, not every tokenholder is also a miner — the great majority do not have the ability or resources to mine. But with PoS protocols, each holder of the token is incentivized to participate in the network or risk having their ownership diluted.If the participation rate — i.e., the amount of tokenholders who stake — is low, then those who receive staking rewards will enjoy outsized returns, not just their pro rata share of the network inflation.As a tokenholder, not participating in a PoS network results in a financial loss. In some networks, individuals need to stake coins just to break even against inflation. Nevertheless, in applying the 2014 IRS guidance, staking rewards are considered ordinary income. In PoW protocols, network security is completely separate from token ownership. In PoS protocols, individuals work to maintain the same level of the network.The 2014 guidance to proof-of-stake networks introduced several taxation issues for network participants as they earn rewards. These issues concern taxation as it relates to the timing of taxable events, network inflation and network participation rates.Timing of taxation: In volatile cryptocurrency markets, coin values can fluctuate widely. Taxes on staking rewards are calculated at the moment token rewards are received under current IRS guidance. By the time a network participant pays taxes, the value of the coin could have dropped significantly. The coins aren’t worth what they were when they were received, yet they are taxed based on the value when they were received, leaving the network participant with a huge tax burden.Network inflation: In order for a network participant to earn staking rewards, they need to bond those tokens to the network. If all tokenholders, bond their tokens to participate in securing the network, the token rewards are distributed evenly based on the network inflation rate. For example, if John stakes 100 tokens and the network inflation rate is 10%, assuming there is 100% staking participation, John would earn 10 new tokens when rewards are issued by the network. In this scenario, staking effectively enables John to recapture the dilution of his pro rata share of the network. But under current IRS guidance, John is required to pay taxes on the total dollar value of these tokens at the time the rewards are received, even if his pro rata share of the network did not increase.Network participation: While PoS network participation is extremely high — both Cosmos and Tezos have participation rates over 70% — in reality networks rarely see 100% of tokenholders participating in staking. For example, if Alice owns 100 tokens in the same network, and Alice does not participate in staking, the 10 tokens Alice would have earned for securing the network — given the same 10% network inflation rate — will be redistributed to all those tokenholders who chose to stake, including some to John who will now earn slightly more than 10 tokens for staking. Under current IRS guidance, John is taxed on the dollar value of all of these rewards — the 10 tokens corresponding to the network inflation rate plus his portion of the tokens Alice would have earned — even though the majority of these rewards only cover the recapturing of the dilution of his pro rata share of the network.The current IRS guidance, as applied to PoS networks, creates an excessive tax burden for network participants. Applying 2014 Bitcoin mining guidance would strongly discourage network participation in the U.S. today. If left unaddressed, this could eventually drive innovators to leave the U.S. for countries with more forward-thinking tax regulations.Abraham Sutherland, an adjunct professor at the University of Virginia School of Law, recently published a research paper in Tax Notes that argued staking rewards should be treated as “created property.” This is a new application of a decades-old concept of taxpayer-created or taxpayer-discovered property such as crops, minerals, livestock, artworks and even widgets off an assembly line. In these examples, the property logically isn't taxed at creation but when it is sold. Taxing staking rewards as created property will ensure that tokenholders are not on the receiving end of excessive tax bills.Tax laws, when tailored to promising new technologies, can actually foster innovation. In 1998, Congress passed the Internet Tax Freedom Act, which bars federal, state and local governments from taxing internet access and from imposing discriminatory internet-only taxes such as bit taxes, bandwidth taxes and email taxes. The ITFA also bars multiple taxes on electronic commerce — a huge stimulus to growing the internet economy in the U.S.More than 30 years later, the U.S. is now a well-established leader of the global movement in internet innovation with Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Netflix and Amazon growing into some of the most valuable publicly traded companies in the world. The U.S. is still benefiting to this day from the regulatory foresight that ensured the internet had the opportunity to grow here.From a policy perspective, U.S. regulators play an important role in carefully considering tax laws so that they provide an environment that cultivates these protocols. Like the early days of the internet, we are still in the beginning stages of blockchain.

But when it comes to exploring into the tokenized economy they really don’t know much — they are like the blind leading the blind. I learned that very quickly.” “I keep my traditional attorneys on the traditional side and then I hire a few blockchain attorneys who are much younger and very much into tokenized economies — and then I deal with all sides and balance the two,” she added.Ta also noted the difficulties of seeking legal advice on an emerging industry with rapidly changing regulatory guidelines and challenges, stating:“One of the things I learned in this industry is that we need legal experts and attorneys, but we have to also be ahead of them before they can guide us correctly.”“Slowly but surely I believe the industry is going to mature when it comes to regulations — and that is where I believe where adoption is going to grow,” she added."
