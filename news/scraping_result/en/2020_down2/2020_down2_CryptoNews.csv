","The third Bitcoin (BTC) halving will change the mining industry. With mining reward effectively being cut by 50%, many miners and mining companies will be forced offline. ","Only the most efficient and economically viable will survive. The question is: will the surviving miners be mostly concentrated in China, as they are today?Within the Bitcoin mining industry, there are two common answers to this question: “no,” and “yes, but not to the same extent.” Many China-based miners will go offline, and in their place miners from other nations – such as the United States and Russia – will gain more of a prominent role in the Bitcoin mining ecosystem. And it’s already happening. There’s a well-known reason why 65% of Bitcoin’s hashrate is currently controlled by mining pools located in China. As OKEx’s chief strategy officer Alysa Xu reminds, it’s all to do with economics.“The mining industry is heavily concentrated in China for two main reasons,” she says. “One is that the major mining machine manufacturers are located in China, and the other is that the electricity fees are relatively cheaper in some areas of China than the rest of the world.”Monthly share of total hasrate in AprilThe head of Binance Pool, Lisa He, also notes that other economic factors weigh in China’s favor.“Three key elements determine the profitability and success of every Bitcoin mining operation, no matter how small or large,” she tells Cryptonews.com. “You need to have access to cheap electricity, affordable and stable internet connection, and workforce. I personally believe that the reason why China currently attributes to 65% of the total Bitcoin hash rate lies in exactly these three elements.”Basically, the view of He and Xu is that the Bitcoin halving will do little to remove these advantages.“I believe that halving will not have much impact on this,” says Alysa Xu. “Although halving reduces block rewards, as the flood season arrives, electricity fees will be cheaper in China – mining costs will be lower too.”That said, there is still scope for the current 65% concentration to be reduced after the Bitcoin halving. This is particularly the case if Bitcoin’s price stagnates or declines in the immediate aftermath of the halving.“If bitcoin’s price stays the same, we expect to see a drop in Bitcoin’s hashrate as older generation mining hardware becomes unprofitable and goes offline in mining farms that are more focussed on short-term gains than a longer-term or sustainable business operation,” says BitRiver CEO Igor Runets. Runets notes that, because most mining farms are located in China, we would see more hashrate going offline from China than from anywhere else. In other words, the Bitcoin halving would bring “at least a temporary decrease” in Bitcoin mining concentration.Similarly, Lisa He explains that the price of bitcoin is the biggest factor in deciding whether the Bitcoin halving might reduce China’s dominance of the mining sector. “If the price keeps going up, then we can expect more centralization of mining in China,” she says. “However, if the price goes down and renders mining less profitable, we might see more miners appearing in the different regions.”But if Bitcoin’s hashrate distribution veers away from China, where exactly would it go? Well, perhaps unsurprisingly for the CEO of a Russia-based mining colocation provider, Igor Runets predicts that Russia will become a more prominent part of the ecosystem after the Bitcoin halving.“We expect Russia to become more prominent within the Bitcoin mining sector,” he says. “The region produces green, renewable and surplus power throughout the year and the governments support the economic as well as social benefits that large mining operations like ours bring to the region.”Runets expects that Russia will continue to attract miners from around the world. However, while Lisa He and Alysa Xu acknowledge that other nations may rise in relative prominence, they’re not sure just how far they will rise after the Bitcoin halving.And while other countries are experimenting with renewable and cheap electricity sources, “still, they’re often facing issues related to incomplete infrastructure,” according to Lisa He. Alysa Xu has similar views. “As far as I understand, countries such as the United States, Russia, Turkey, and Ukraine are gradually picking up interests in Bitcoin mining, but I don’t think they will take over China’s position as the largest mining country in the world.” As reported this week, Ukraine’s plan to offset the financial chaos of the coronavirus pandemic might involve nuclear-powered cryptocurrency mining.And while Chinese miners will most likely be hardest hit by the Bitcoin halving, the Chinese government has increasingly been taking steps to support the national mining sector.“The Chinese government's policy on Bitcoin mining has gradually shifted from negative to positive,” explains Alysa Xu. “Last year, the government wanted to eliminate Bitcoin mining, yet recently, some local governments, such as Sichuan, have already indicated that they will be supporting the mining industry during the flood season.”All the largest Bitcoin mining pools are from ChinaGiven this increased positive engagement from Chinese authorities, it’s unlikely that the Bitcoin halving will have a big impact on the concentration of mining within China. It might reduce it, but China will continue to be the main player in Bitcoin mining for some time to come.The third Bitcoin mining reward halving is estimated to happen on May 11-12.

__________As pandemic panic crushes the life out of the global economy, central banks are pouring trillions of dollars into the global money supply.And America's Federal Reserve is leading the way.It's printing money at such a furious pace, it makes the huge rescue following the failure of Lehman Brothers in 2008 look like pale, stale, ale by comparison.Naturally, wholesale debasement of fiat currencies worldwide is starting to fuel near-insatiable demand for assets beyond the reach of bureaucrats, politicians and governments to corrupt.For centuries, gold has been investors' first choice in this regard. But thanks to the blockchain revolution, we now have Bitcoin (BTC, Tech/Adoption Grade “A”) — which is giving gold a run for its money.Bitcoin offers as tough a defense as gold against government manipulation and control.But in other key respects, it has advantages gold cannot possibly match. For example:Confiscation Resistant. Government bureaucrats cannot inflate away the purchasing power of your gold like they can with fiat currency. But they can send their storm-troopers stomping in to seize it.Don't think stuff like this can't still happen. (Learn more: As US Seized Gold in 1933, Is There a Threat to Bitcoin in the 2020s?)Bankrupt, spendthrift governments — especially when their backs are against the wall — will grab just about any assets they can lay hands on.Just seven years ago, for example, the government of Cyprus confiscated up to 10% its citizens' and residents' bank savings. And now ...As the full extent economic devastation wrought by pandemic lockdowns becomes undeniable ... a lot of chickens are going to come home to roost.Already, Argentina is on the brink of its ninth sovereign default. The ruling mullahs in Teheran are about to knock four zeros off their nearly worthless paper currency (USD 1=42,105 Iranian rials) and re-issue it.As a result, the possibility your gold may be stolen or confiscated is hardly abating. Quite the opposite. It's fast approaching the danger zone. But not so with Bitcoin.The only physical manifestations of your Bitcoin ownership are the character strings that comprise your wallet address and private key.Never has a financial asset been more easily concealable — and therefore less confiscatable — than this.Transport. Gold is 70% heavier than lead. Plus, it requires guards with guns to protect it in transit. That costs money.Also, bank vault services, armed guards, and armored transport services are usually heavily regulated businesses. That means you need at least tacit permission from the government to make any kind of a move.What if you don't have special permission from the government?Just look at what happened to Venezuela when it tried to access [USD] 1.2 billion of its own gold reserves from the Bank of England — where it was supposed to be held in safe custody!By contrast, Bitcoin is weightless and travels over the Internet without anyone's permission. And at near zero cost.Holding Costs. Gold requires a secure location. If you don't have your own vault, you will have to rent one at a bank or other trusted institution. By contrast, Bitcoin costs nothing to store.For all these reasons, we think it's pretty clear ...Indeed, recent history bears this out. After world central banks went on their money-printing rampage in 2008 …To be clear, we're not saying Bitcoin is going to go up another million percent from here (almost USD 10,000 today). But 3- or 4-fold gains are well within the realm of possibility. Already, since the mid-March flash-crash in the investment markets, Bitcoin has been outperforming gold 5-to-1.

","After legendary hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones made waves in the Cryptoverse with his bullish statements on Thursday, the crypto community wonders whether the investor holds physical bitcoin (BTC) that just spiked above USD 10,000 for the first time since February.","In a letter to his clients, Jones said that he has authorized his hedge fund – Tudor BVI – to allocate “a low single digit” of its assets to bitcoin futures contracts. At the end of March, the fund had over USD 21 billion in assets under management. If the fund would allocate 1%, it would mean an investment of around USD 210 million.    Jones first dabbled in BTC in 2017, doubling his money before selling BTC near its peak at almost USD 20,000, and now he said he ""made the case for owning bitcoin, the quintessence of scarcity premium.""Some members of the cryptoverse speculate that ""his personal family office probably has physical [bitcoin]"" and now Jones wants his investors to have access to BTC returns and hedging properties.""The hate on [Paul Tudor Jones] buying bitcoin fiat futures instead of physical bitcoin is misplaced. Right now he just wants exposure to the price risk. When he starts feeling uncertain about the fiat infrastructure, he'll learn to run his own node and hold his own private keys,"" the Bitcoin evangelist at Kraken, Pierre Rochard, said.At pixel time (06:55 UTC), BTC trades at USD 9,819, dropping from USD 10,029 reached earlier today. The price is stil up by 6% in a day and 11.5% in a week. Bitcoin dominance, or the percentage of the whole market capitalization, increased to 67%, where it was in January.“With the Bitcoin halving fast approaching, we believe a short-term pullback is highly likely immediately post-halving, as traders begin taking profits,” Lennard Neo, head of research at Stack AM Pte., which provides cryptocurrency trackers and index funds, told Bloomberg. “In the longer-term, however, we can expect bitcoin to register significant price appreciation toward the end of 2020 and early 2021.”Meanwhile, Jones, in his letter, warned about “The Great Monetary Inflation” that is happening right now, while calling bitcoin “a great way to defend oneself” against it.The investor revealed that the money printing by central banks has made him think about ways to hedge against inflation, evaluating everything from gold to treasuries, certain fiat currencies, and stocks. In the end, however, he realized that there is a “growing role for bitcoin,” as it scores well on criteria for being a good store of value, which he said includes its trustworthiness, liquidity and portability.And although Jones scored bitcoin lower than gold and other assets as a store of value, he said it surprised him how well it actually scored, adding:“It scores 66% of gold as a store of value, but has a market cap that is 1/60 that of gold’s outstanding value. Something appears wrong here and my guess is it’s the price of bitcoin.”Jones further explained that he believes bitcoin will benefit from “the coming digitization of currency everywhere, accelerated by COVID-19,” which in Jones’ view will “make the understanding, utility, and ease of ownership of bitcoin a much more commonplace option than it is today.”“Bitcoin reminds me of gold when I first got into the business in 1976,” Jones further said.According to the legendary trader’s own calculations, governments and central banks around the world have so far printed USD 3.9 trillion in new money – equivalent to 6.6% of global economic output – to counter the COVID-19-induced economic slowdown.“It has happened globally with such speed that even a market veteran like myself was left speechless,” Jones said, while adding “We are witnessing the Great Monetary Inflation – an unprecedented expansion of every form of money unlike anything the developed world has ever seen.”“The best profit-maximizing strategy is to own the fastest horse,” Jones said, adding that “If I am forced to forecast, my bet is it will be bitcoin.”Meanwhile, posting on Twitter earlier today, Real Vision founder Raoul Pal said that the current chart set-up, combined with the extremely supportive economic backdrop, has created a “perfect set up” for bitcoin.Bitcoin Porn and The Perfect Set Up... $BTC #BITCOIN___Learn more: Considering Adding Bitcoin to Your Portfolio?

May 10, 2020
","For many, Bitcoin’s (BTC’s) Lightning Network (LN) is viewed as a way for the world’s most popular cryptocurrency to enable faster, cheaper payments. While many altcoins, such as Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Litecoin (LTC), have specifically focused on low transaction fees for smaller cryptocurrency payments, the idea with the LN is to enable this functionality for the world’s most widely-used and liquid cryptocurrency— removing the need to create an alternative cryptocurrency network with a new token.","Defining how long the Lightning Network has been around depends on one’s definition of the true launch date of the second-layer payments protocol, but Lightning-enabled bitcoin wallets have been available for a few years now. So, has the LN replaced the need for altcoins focused on lower transaction fees? Let’s take a closer look.In January 2019, it was reported that Bitrefill, which sells gift cards and mobile prepaid cards as part of its business, had already seen the LN overtake all of the individual altcoins in terms of payments.Since then, it has mostly been ethereum (ETH), not the Lightning Network, that has seen some growth relative to other payment options on the platform. According to Bitrefill CEO Sergej Kotliar, the cryptocurrency payments breakdown for the online retailer is currently as follows: “Everything is growing, but in share, Lightning is currently not growing at [the] expense of other payment methods,” Kotliar told Cryptonews.com.It should be noted that this data is in reference to payments made by users that do not have refillable accounts on Bitrefill, where only bitcoin transactions (on chain or Lightning) are accepted.“We're still optimistic about Lightning, especially as we're seeing usage of everything grow right now, and the possibilities especially of integrations with custodial entities, such as what we've done with Bitfinex,” added Kotliar. “But adoption among exchanges is going slowly. I would have expected more by now. Maybe with more fee pressure it will pressure more of them to add Lightning.”Online gambling platform Bitkong shared somewhat similar numbers with Cryptonews.com. According to a Bitkong spokesperson, the current usage breakdown of their available payment options is as follows:“Recently we delisted [BCH] as no one used it,” added the Bitkong spokesperson. “[It didn’t even] cover node hosting costs.”Bitkong will also be removing DASH as a payment option soon, as basically none of their users make their deposits or withdrawals via that cryptocurrency.“We are trying to educate as many players as we can to switch to Lightning wallets,” said the Bitkong spokesperson. “This [has] huge benefits for both sides, as deposits are instant and secure (unlike most altcoins).”According to Bitkong, pretty much all of the growth in Lightning Network usage from their users has taken place rather recently.“We have seen growth only [in the] last three months,” said the spokesperson. “Past year usage was almost none. Reasons can be that we started some Lightning-oriented marketing (like listing at LightningNetworkStores.com) or its growing overall and many users becoming familiar with the network.”While Bitrefill and Bitkong have been accepting Lightning-based BTC payments for quite some time, other major players in the cryptocurrency space are still taking a wait-and-see approach.“We are watching the Bitcoin Lightning development with great interest,” Purse’s Eduardo Gomez told Cryptonews.com. “The reason why we haven't included it is that the transaction [size] limit of the Lightning Network is not quite there yet for the kind of volume we see in our platform (at least the last time we checked that was the case). We are also looking forward to the inclusion of SIGHASH_NOINPUT to make the transactions safer.”SIGHASH_NOINPUT is a soft-forking addition to the Bitcoin protocol that would enable an efficient implementation of a reimagined version of the Lightning Network, known as eltoo (PDF).Purse users are able to make deposits and withdrawals via BTC and BCH. While Gomez did not share specific data regarding how often each option is used, he stated, “BTC is by far the most popular currency in our platform.”Bitcoin’s median on-chain transaction fee has risen from below USD 0.20 to more than USD 1.00 over the past month. If this rise in fees continues, we may eventually get a clearer picture as to whether the Lightning Network’s is replacing the supposed utility of low-fee altcoins."

","Open interest (OI) in bitcoin (BTC) options surpassed USD 1 billion ahead of the halving, with an exponential increase seen across all major marketplaces over the past week. Meanwhile, the bitcoin put-to-call ratio is also on the move, revealing some bearishness in the market.","Although not unusual during bull runs in the spot market, the rising interest in bitcoin options may suggest that some large holders are seeking to protect themselves against an uncertain outcome of the halving, which is now just days away. According to data from the crypto derivatives data provider Skew, the growth in open interest started to take off in early May, with the upwards trend growing exponentially since then. Most notably, the growth in open interest was seen on the EU-based derivatives exchange Deribit, followed by the Asia-based exchange OKEx.Total BTC Options Open InterestOver the same time period, another sign that is pointing to the idea of traders seeking protection is a rise in the bitcoin put-to-call ratio. What this essentially means is that there is an increasing amount of money being placed on bets that bitcoin will go down in price, compared to the amount of money betting on higher prices – generally considered a bearish sign in any market.BTC Put/Call RatioHowever, another – and perhaps more likely – explanation is that some large holders in bitcoin have taken to the options market now – ahead of the halving – essentially using it as insurance against a potential price crash, or even just against high volatility in the bitcoin spot market.By buying a bitcoin put option, the trader would simply have to pay a small amount of money as “premium,” while enjoying a large pay-out if the price of bitcoin falls below a certain strike price. If the price in the spot market instead rises, however, the option would simply expire worthless and the trader would only have lost his initial premium payment, while being able to cash in from his position in the spot market.Options trading was also recently suggested as a way to get leveraged exposure to the growth in the crypto market more generally by Three Arrows Capital CEO Su Zhu – who is affiliated with Deribit – saying that buying bitcoin call options might be better than “looking for 18x in shitcoins.” A call option gives the investors the right to buy an asset and a put option gives the right to sell it.Stop looking for 18x in shitcoins and consider $BTC call options instead https://t.co/lVxEgPLvb5"
