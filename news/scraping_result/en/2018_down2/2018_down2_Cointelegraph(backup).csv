The amount of BTC handled by major payment processors reportedly dropped by almost 80 percent from the beginning of the year to September.The analysis of individual payment processors??figures reportedly shows a downward trend. At Canadian firm Coinpayments, the value of transactions has fallen by more than half between January and October 2018, Reuters reports, citing data from blockchain analysis site OXT. Lex Sokolin, global director of fintech strategy at research firm Autonomous Next, said that ?úBitcoin payments processing is seeing a slow but consistent decline.?ùComprehensive data on the leading cryptocurrency used for payments is reportedly not consistent since trades with other currencies are commonly included together with its use for commercial payments.Although Chainalysis recognizes a growing stability of BTC, the value of Bitcoin payments reportedly slumped from $427 million last December to $96 million in September 2018.While many believe that BTC?ôs relative stability this year will result in the mainstream deployment of it as a payment method by both individuals and commercial organizations, some financial firms and crypto entrepreneurs think that stability is not enough.Joni Teves, a strategist at London-based financial firm UBS, told Reuters that BTC needs to become faster and cheaper, also noting that the development of clearer rules on an asset would help give users a sense of legitimacy.Some major companies that previously accepted BTC have turned away from the cryptocurrency as a payment method. Microsoft announced in January that after almost three years it would stop accepting BTC. However, it did reserve that position after taking its own steps to: ?úensure lower Bitcoin amounts would be redeemable by customers.?ùThe gaming platform Steam also stopped accepting BTC payments in December 2017, over a year after it began accepting Bitcoin when the currency was trading around $450. Among concerns over volatility and regulatory uncertainty, industry players also cite the issue of growing transaction fees and slow transactions speeds as barriers to wider adoption.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

where ABC stands for Adjustable Blocksize Cap) is spearheaded by the ...",26-Nov-18,"It has been more than a week since the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) blockchain was split into two during the fateful hard fork. Two opposing sides clashed over the future of BCH as an asset, and it is time to see where both parties stand, now that the dust has finally started to settle.","As described in an earlier Cointelegraph article, Bitcoin ABC (BCH ABC, where ABC stands for Adjustable Blocksize Cap) is spearheaded by the likes of Roger Ver, renowned BCH advocate, and Jihan Wu, co-founder of Bitmain, an extremely powerful mining outfit. It was founded back in July 2017 as part of the original BCH blockchain, but morphed into an independent entity as the conflict escalated and the split became inevitable.BCH ABC proponents stand for the idea that the basic structure of BCH ?údoes not need any radical change.??Still, Bitcoin ABC?ôs roadmap suggests further development of the network, mainly via increasing Bitcoin Cash?ôs blocksize (hence the name) and minimizing transactions costs.On the other side of the corner was Bitcoin SV (Satoshi?ôs Vision) lead by Craig Wright, who has previously declared himself as Satoshi Nakamoto. Other supporters include niche news outlets like CoinGeek, CalvinAyre and Bitcoin.org. BCH SV was created in August 2018, not long before the hard fork began.The ?úreformers??attempt to restore ?úthe original Satoshi protocol??by changing the BCH structure. Specifically, the plan involves entirely overwriting the network scripts of Bitcoin ABC and increasing the block size of BCH from 32MB to a maximum of 128MB to elevate network capacity and scale.On Nov. 15, the BCH blockchain was split, and both parties started to form blocks on their respective, separate blockchains. The aim for both was to assert dominance, get as many blocks as possible, and show that their rule set is more reliable. Both sides mobilized some of their mining power, shifting it from BTC to BCH during the peak time of the conflict. That could have affected the Bitcoin (BTC) price, and therefore the overall crypto market, which notoriously started to slump at the time, eventually resulting in the market?ôs current, shredded state.According to statistics from Bitcoin Cash data aggregator Coin Dance, BCH ABC has been accumulating more proof-of-work (PoW) than BCH SV since the date of the split and, eventually, it won the allegiance of major crypto exchanges including Bittrex, Kraken, Bitstamp, and Coinbase, among others, who initially chose to halt BCH trading during the most active stage of the hash war: after several days of silence, those exchanges appointed the winner by assigning the original ?úBCH??ticker to the BCH ABC rule set. Other signs suggesting that BCH ABC has come out ahead include platforms like CoinMarketCap merging BCH and BCHABC listings, and cryptocurrency hardware wallet Ledger, which resumed its BCH services in the form of BCH ABC only.Further, news about BCH SV failure could have helped BCH ABC to further cement its winning position. On Nov. 19, Peter Rizun, chief scientist of Bitcoin Unlimited, reported that BCHSV suffered a blockchain reorganization (a situation when a node or a blockchain client needs to disregard blocks they have previously considered as accepted). Emin G√ºn Sirer, creator of the world?ôs first cryptocurrency to deploy a PoW concept and vocal critic of BCH, soon questioned BCHSV?ôs level of decentralization.?úThis should not be possible in a decentralized system.?úYou can only invalidate your own block and create a new tail if you're the majority miner. BCHSV is a centralized coin.?ùNevertheless, Bitcoin SV is far from being dead. First, on Nov. 16, Binance, one of the largest players among crypto exchanges, opted to stay neutral in the fight: its CEO, Changpeng Zhao, announced that both tickers ??BCHABC and BCHSV ???úwill stay??on his platform under their respective tickers, thus recognizing BCHSV as an independent entity. Currently, BCH ABC trades at $183 there, while BCH SV is set at $114. BCH price on other exchanges seem to correlate with BCH ABC price on Binance, as per CoinMarketCap data.Then, around Nov. 19, Kraken, the platform which initially claimed it would only support one of the two BCH chains ??Bitcoin Cash ABC ??launched trading of its counterpart chain, Bitcoin SV under the ?úBSV??ticker. Still, in the accompanying blog post Kraken warned its clients that ?úBitcoin SV does NOT meet Kraken?ôs usual listing requirements,??adding that there are ?úmany red flags??that traders should be aware of, including miner coercion:?úCustodial losses taken on due to attacks originating from nChain or its affiliates will be socialized among all BSV holders on Kraken. Given the volatile state of the network and threats that have been made, Kraken cannot guarantee perfect custody of BSV.?ùAfterwords, on Nov. 23, billionaire entrepreneur and BCH SV supporter, Calvin Ayre, declared that the coin ?úno longer want[s] the name Bitcoin Cash [BCH]??in an article published on his own crypto media outlet CoinGeek.The statement clarified that Bitcoin Cash SV will continue to exist independently from Bitcoin Cash (BCH), and that the coin is in fact the ?úoriginal??Bitcoin (BTC):?úBitcoin SV is the original Bitcoin not the original Bitcoin Cash.?ùBitcoin (BTC), in turn, is referred to as ?úSegwit BTC??in the article.The author also accuses supporters of both BTC and BCH of having ?útinkered it [Bitcoin] to death,??as their cryptocurrencies ?úabandoned Bitcoin?ôs core principles by abandoning Nakamoto consensus and trust in miners??Proof of Work.?ùAyre finished by saying that he has instructed his team to ?ústart working with everyone??to release Bitcoin SV as an independent coin from Bitcoin Cash. The coin is scheduled to release as soon as next week during a CoinGeek event.BCH, in turn, has been steadily losing its value since the hard fork began. It trades at around $197 as of press time, according to Coin360.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,https://cointelegraph.com,21-Nov-18,Amazon: How E-Commerce Giant Chose Blockchain Over Bitcoin,https://cointelegraph.com/news/amazon-how-e-commerce-giant-chose-blockchain-over-bitcoin,"Amazon: How E-Commerce Giant Chose Blockchain Over Bitcoin. On November 13, 
Amazon was granted with two crypto-related patents. 18428 ...",21-Nov-18,"On November 13, Amazon was granted two crypto-related patents. While the American e-commerce pioneer, with a revenue of over $177 billion, has not chosen to accept Bitcoin (BTC) and major altcoins as a payment option despite public interest and competitors??experience, it has not ignored the subject altogether. In fact, Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company?ôs cloud computing arm, has contributed to blockchain adoption.","Amazon has a complex relationship with crypto. In April 2014, the e-commerce giant decided not to accept Bitcoin (BTC) citing customer preferences. Amazon payments head Tom Taylor told Recode in an interview:?úObviously it gets a lot of press and we have considered it, [...] but we?ôre not hearing from customers that it?ôs right for them and don?ôt have any plans within Amazon to engage Bitcoin.?ùCuriously, the move came just few months after Overstock.com, one of Amazon?ôs rivals, became the first major retail company to introduce BTC as a payment option and found initial success, as its CEO Patrick Byrne claimed that Amazon would have to ?úfollow suit.?ùTaylor?ôs comment could have meant that the e-commerce giant would turn to cryptocurrencies once they see more exposure. However, the 2014 decision stays to date, regardless of the overall improved market capitalization and adoption, public petitions addressed to CEO Jeff Bezos, and some businesses being built around serving as the middlemen for Amazon customers willing to pay with digital currencies.Nevertheless, Amazon has not distanced itself from engaging with crypto altogether. In May 2014, not long after announcing it had no plans for crypto, Amazon was awarded a Bitcoin-related patent for the use of digital currencies as payment for cloud computing services on Amazon Web Services (AWS). It is worth noting, however, that the patent was filed back in March 2012, and crypto was mentioned as only one possible form of payment there.In November 2017, the e-commerce giant was reported purchasing a number of crypto-related domain names including ?úamazoncryptocurrencies.com,???úamazoncryptocurrency.com,??and ?úamazonethereum.com.??It was also noted at the time that ?úamazonbitcoin.com??redirects to the original Amazon URL.However, it could have been an attempt to shield the Amazon brand or avoid confusion with Amazon Coin, the company?ôs digital currency that was introduced in 2013 for Kindle e-book owners. The coin has not seen extensive use despite the documented public interest.In April 2018, Amazon won a patent for a subscription feed system described as a ?ústreaming data marketplace.??Essentially, the company claimed, it could ?úidentify [Bitcoin] transaction participants??for governments and law enforcement. The document was filled in June 2014 and showed that while the e-commerce giant might accept the idea of dealing with crypto, it put strong emphasis on the Know Your Customer (KYC) side of the business. That, in turn, would neglect a major part of Bitcoin?ôs ideology and design.Thus, Amazon has not shown itself to be exactly a pro-Bitcoin company. Nevertheless, its relationship with the underlying technology, blockchain, has proven to be much more fruitful.On December 5, Amazon Web Services (AWS) announced a partnership with R3 ??a major blockchain consortium of over 200 members ??to allow its Corda platform to become one of the first distributed ledger technology solutions (DLT) on the AWS marketplace. Corda is an open-source DLT platform designed to work within finance to operate complex transactions and restrict access to transaction data. Basically, it allowed users to deploy decentralized applications (dApps) onto the AWS platform and to create new apps directly.The news came as a shock, granted that just a few days before the announcement, AWS CEO Andy Jassy essentially criticized blockchain for not having use cases ?úbeyond the distributed ledger,??noting that even those had very limited capabilities. Moreover, he reiterated the company?ôs policy not to ?úbuild technology because we think it is cool.?ùHe did add, however, that AWS was interested in ways that blockchain could benefit their customers:?úWe are very intrigued by what customers are ultimately going to do there.?ùStill, there were at least three blockchain-based platforms on the AWS marketplace before Corda?ôs arrival and Jassy?ôs speech, which shows that Amazon?ôs initial interest in blockchain arose earlier in 2017.On April 19, 2018, AWS?ôs journey into blockchain continued. The cloud platform introduced its blockchain framework for Ethereum (ETH) and Hyperledger Fabric, allowing users to build and manage their own blockchain-powered DApps. Called AWS CloudFormation Templates, the tool was designed to avoid the time-consuming manual setup of one?ôs own blockchain network.Next month, in May, AWS partnered up with ConsenSys, a blockchain incubator started by Ethereum?ôs co-founder Joseph Lubin. Specifically, the e-commerce company collaborated with Kaleido ??a blockchain business cloud that aims to help firms accelerate the ?úentire journey from experimentation and PoCs [proofs-of-concept] to pilots and production,??and is based on the Ethereum blockchain. Together, they aim to offer simplified blockchain cloud platforms for its clients so that they can ?úfocus on their scenario, [without having] to become PhDs in cryptography,??as Kaleido co-founder Steve Cerveny explained to CNBC.Kaleido has since expanded to a full-stack platform dubbed ?úKaleido Marketplace.??It reportedly ?úeliminates 80 percent of the custom code??needed to build a given blockchain project by providing an array of tools and protocols that are ?úplug-and-play,??spanning needs from back-end development to front-end app user interfaces.Currently, there are around 25 blockchain-oriented platforms hosted on the AWS platform, some of which are also reporting promising results. For instance, in September, a blockchain system developed by Australia?ôs national science agency (CSIRO) and Sydney University claimed to have set a benchmark of 40,000 transactions per second during a test on Amazon Cloud ??for comparison, BTC infrastructure normally scales up to eight transactions per second, while ETH blockchain capability is set at 15 transactions per second.Amazon?ôs blockchain experiments have attracted recognition from mainstream players: for example, ?úBig Four??audit and consulting firm Deloitte has emphasized Amazon?ôs blockchain-related efforts in its October report, arguing that the e-commerce giant had been helping to stimulate technology adoption and contributing to improving the costs of operations on blockchain. Additionally, Bank of America (BoA) research analyst, Kash Rangan, told CNBC that blockchain is well-suited to some of the world?ôs largest corporations, noting:""Amazon will benefit from incremental cloud services demand from blockchain implementation, while improved supply chain tracking should make Amazon's retail operations more efficient.""While Amazon has been acquiring both cryptocurrencies and blockchain-related patents, it is fair to take them with a grain of salt ??as the industry is still young, a lot of players, like the aforementioned Bank of America (BoA), which currently has the most of such patents, are merely trying to mark the field before the others get there. Consequently, not all patents (blockchain-related or not) are going to be put to use any time soon. For instance, in 2016 Amazon was awarded a patent for a system to deliver goods through a chain of underground tunnels, a highly ambitious and costful goal that is probably not the company?ôs top priority.On November 13, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) published two more Amazon patents related to methods for protecting the integrity of digital signatures and improving distributed data storage, filed in April 2018 and December 2015 respectively.The first patent document outlines a ?úsignature delegation??method for ?úprotecting the integrity of digital signatures and encrypted communications,??by allowing for the generation, distribution, validation, and revocation of one-time-use cryptographic keys. In the proposed system, these keys are arranged in what is known in cryptography as the so-called ?úMerkle Tree??structure, which is essentially a binary tree of hashes constructed from the bottom up.Amazon?ôs second patent, is related to distributed data storage. The filing proposes a ?úgrid encoding technique,??using groups of collected ?úshards,??where each shard represents a logical distribution of data items stored in a given grid. The patent filing suggests this method can help minimize storage redundancy.While Amazon might be having more patents coming, the e-commerce giant is nowhere to be seen in the main part of patents, occupied by the likes of its Chinese counterpart Alibaba and IBM. Nevertheless, Amazon is set to continue its explanation of the technology, as the AWS platform continues hosting blockchain solutions, and the company is looking to expand its staff with more blockchain engineers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

That said, the fees incurred by using these payment processors can mean that Bitcoin costs a little bit extra on average.Unlike other exchanges, Paxful also enables its customers to buy Bitcoin using gift cards, enabling them to swap unwanted presents for cryptocurrency. It accepts vouchers from an extensive range of retailers ??including Amazon, Apple, the PlayStation Network, Google Play, Banana Republic, Walmart, Victoria?ôs Secret and many more.When it comes to these payment methods, Paxful uses a peer-to-peer marketplace where sellers connect directly with buyers. Those who are interested in exchanging their Bitcoin for gift cards can specify the minimum or maximum value of the vouchers they are willing to pay and set the exchange rate. This creates healthy competition among the sellers, as well as providing choice for buyers.Paxful says that keeping its customers safe ??as well as their cash or crypto ??is a top priority. Transactions go through an escrow service, with funds placed in the control of an independent third party until all of the terms have been met. This helps to prevent an unscrupulous seller from taking someone?ôs gift card or money without delivering the Bitcoin they promised.Disputes can also be raised whenever a transaction does not go to plan, with an impartial moderator intervening to settle the trade. In addition to these measures, Paxful has a customer support team who can answer queries 24 hours a day, seven days a week.The platform has also been proactive in preventing fraud and cyber attacks. Recently, it teamed up with an anti-phishing company to help track down fake mobile apps and websites which were purporting to have an affiliation with Paxful.As well as helping the public to get their hands on Bitcoin safely and securely, Paxful has made a concerted effort to engage in humanitarian projects that make a difference.The company is planning to complete building a second school to benefit children in the African nation of Rwanda through its #BuiltWithBitcoin initiative after receiving donations worth $100,000 in five cryptocurrencies.Boasting six classrooms, six full-time teachers, bathrooms and a water well, the school is the first to open in the area and was made a reality in collaboration with humanitarian organization Zam Zam Water.Paxful has bold plans to construct 100 African schools in the coming years ??and is also devoted to other philanthropic causes, including providing scholarships to Afghan refugees. Ray Youseff, the platform?ôs CEO and co-founder, said: ?úWe encourage the cryptocurrency sector to contribute more to humanitarian projects. The #BuiltWithBitcoin initiative is an example of bitcoin being used as more than a speculative tool but a testament to the usefulness of cryptocurrency.??

The miner that solves the next block then dictates how the blockchain continues, as the block they mined on top of then becomes 'calonical' per Nakamoto consensus, because it has more work committed to it. Reorg itself is a situation when a node or a blockchain client need to disregard blocks they have previously considered as accepted.When the network agrees on which fork to use, the redundant block which will not see a continuation of the blockchain built on top of it, as it is ?úorphaned.?ùWhen blockchains experience congestion, however, information about blocks may reach miners slower than usual, meaning that miners keep mining blocks that are now obsolete, and if they are successful, one of the blocks will eventually need to be orphaned.In this aforementioned event, the BCHSV reorg came about due to the mining arm of cryptocurrency news publication Coingeek, a party in favor of BCHSV, orphaning its own blocks. It is not clear whether it was intentional or due to an error, but the event demonstrated that one pool possesses enough hashing power to revert blocks and transactions on BCH SV network.The events were relayed to social media by Peter Rizun, chief scientist of Bitcoin Unlimited.Emin G√ºn Sirer, creator of the world?ôs first cryptocurrency to deploy a PoW concept and vocal critic of BCH, continued the debate, noting that the possibility for miners to make their own blocks redundant raised questions about the BCHSV?ôs level of decentralization.?úThis should not be possible in a decentralized system,??he wrote, adding:?úYou can only invalidate your own block and create a new tail if you're the majority miner. BCHSV is a centralized coin.?ùBCHSV has seen limited uptake on major cryptocurrency exchanges, among which was U.S. platform Kraken, which issued a strongly-worded warning to users when it allocated tokens and opened trading.Prices have also declined, Kraken?ôs BCHSV/USD (written at BSV/USD) pair hitting lows of $32.40 Nov. 21. At press time, BCHSV is trading at around $49.77 on CoinMarketCap, down about 6.66 percent over a 24 hour period.Bitcoin Cash has drawn accusations over centralization before, veteran cryptographer Nick Szabo openly labeling the coin as ?úcentralized sock puppetry??last year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

rallies well above year-to-date lows. 27698 Total views. 316 Total ...",02-Dec-18,"Critics are pointing to large energy consumption by the Bitcoin mining industry as a threat to the global climate. However, CoinShares, a digital asset management firm, estimates that about 77.6 percent of Bitcoin mining is done using renewable energy, arguing the harm to the environment is much less than what it is made out to be.","After the mayhem in November, crypto markets are showing the first signs of buying at lower levels. The total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies peaked just above $138 billion today, a 20 percent increase over the year-to-date lows of about $115.101 billion.The markets are unlikely to switch from a downtrend to an uptrend in a short span of time ?ì‚Ä?we anticipate a few weeks of base building before cryptocurrencies launch a new uptrend. All the virtual currencies will not bottom at the same time and neither will they rally equally higher. Hence, an eye on the chart patterns can help traders enter the outperformers at the right moment.TRON (TRX) has overtaken Ethereum as the most popular decentralized application (DApp) platform in the world, according to DappRadar, a website that monitors DApp platforms.TRON?ôs founder and CEO Justin Sun said that the virtual currency will add privacy features to its network early next year. The company is also establishing a blockchain gaming fund, TRON Arcade, with an investment objective of about $100 million in the next three years.After TRX stayed in the range of $0.01587681??0.02815521 for about three months, the bears broke below it last week. The breakdown had a lower target of $0.00844479, but the bulls are attempting to bounce off $0.01089965. Currently, the previous support of $0.01587681 will act as a stiff resistance. If the bulls succeed in rising and sustaining above this resistance, a rally to the 20-week EMA is likely.The TRX/USD pair has not been able to break out of the 20-week EMA since falling below it in early June. Therefore, if the bulls climb above it and the top of the range at $0.02815521, we can expect the start of a new uptrend. However, if the bears defend the resistance, a retest of the recent lows of $0.01089965 is probable.Some see Litecoin (LTC) as a failed experiment and they expect the price to fall further. However, others believe that the current fall is a buying opportunity and the digital currency can make a new high in the future. Let?ôs take a look at what the charts suggest.The LTC/USD pair has witnessed a massive erosion of wealth in recent months. Currently, the bulls are attempting to bounce off $28, a level not seen since mid-June of last year. The trend is down as the digital currency has failed to hold key support levels throughout the year. There has not been a noticeable bounce for the altcoin since April of this year.The RSI has also entered into the oversold territory, which increases the possibility of a bounce. The first resistance on the upside is $47.246, above which the recovery can extend to the next resistance zone of the 20-week EMA and $69.279. After such a massive decline, we anticipate the virtual currency to enter into a range and form a base, before starting a new uptrend. If, however, the bears sink below $28, the next support is at $19.752.NEM (XEM) is the third best performing cryptocurrency in the past seven days, rising closer to 8 percent.The bears broke below the range of $0.07790717??0.13125258 on Nov. 24, but could not sustain lower levels. This shows buyers are willing to support the XEM/USD pair at lower levels.The virtual currency rallied back into the above range on Nov. 28. Currently, both the bulls and the bears are fighting for supremacy. The bulls want to keep the price inside the range, while the bears want to sustain below the range.If the bulls succeed, it will indicate that the recent breakdown was a bear trap. In such a case, the price is likely to gradually rally back to the top of the range, closer to $0.13. On the other hand, if the bears maintain the price below the range and sink below the Nov. 25 intraday low of $0.06155741, the next support on the downside is at $0.05.The moving averages are flattening out and the RSI is also climbing closer to 50 levels, suggesting a consolidation in the near term.Bitcoin (BTC) had its worst November since 2011, as the price fell 37 percent. Such a massive fall in a period of a month shows signs of distress selling by the bulls. Bottoms are generally formed during such periods of capitulation. Will the leading digital currency stage a comeback or sink further? Let?ôs try to find out.The BTC/USD pair is trying to find support close to the critical support zone of $3,000??3,500. This is an important zone that should hold. A break down of this will further damage sentiment and can extend the fall to the next lower level of $1,752. However, we give it a very low probability of occurring.Usually, after violating a critical support ??in this case, $5,900 ??the price retests the breakdown level. If that happens, the digital currency can rally back to anywhere between $5,000 and $5,900, though it is difficult to pinpoint the exact level it will reach.The RSI has reached levels last seen in early 2015, which shows the kind of damage the digital currency has seen this year. We are seeing first signs of buying, but will need to see more to confirm a bottom.Work has started towards the upgrade of Ethereum (ETH) to Ethereum 1x, which will reportedly improve the network?ôs usability. The said upgrade might be activated by June 2019. In other news, the citizens of Manila have an opportunity to earn some Ethereum by cleaning up polluted beaches.The University of Basel, Switzerland?ôs oldest university, has conferred an honorary doctorate to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin for ?úoutstanding achievements in fields of cryptocurrencies, smart contracts, and the design of institutions.?ùAfter showing promise through the middle of the year, the ETH/USD pair has turned weak, as it continues to break down at critical support levels. Currently, the bulls are trying to hold the psychological support of $100.The RSI has reached close to oversold levels, last seen at the end of 2016. This movement suggests that selling has been overdone and a bounce is likely. The first resistance on any rebound will be at $136.12, followed by $167.32.If the bears turn the digital currency down from one of the above-mentioned resistance levels, and sink it below $100, a fall to $66 is possible. After such a large fall, the price is likely to go through a bottoming process before embarking on a new uptrend.¬†",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Going against the trend, at such times, turns out to be a profitable decision. A prolonged downtrend is also a good time to sell out the positions that don?ôt have sound fundamentals and shift into cryptocurrencies that have a bright future.Though the total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies has plunged about 87 percent from its highs, Bitcoin has managed to maintain its dominance above the 50 mark throughout the fall.

From the lows, it pulled back 221.79 percent to reach an intraday high of $123.98 on Nov. 26.The recovery stalled at the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement level of the fall. Since Nov. 26, the digital currency has been trading in a range of $123.98-$80.352.

This suggests demand on dips.If the price climbs back into the range and sustains it for three days, it will confirm that the markets have rejected the lower levels. Traders can initiate long positions above the 50-day SMA and expect a move back towards the top of the range.On the other hand, if the digital currency turns down from the 20-day EMA and breaks down of $0.06155741, the fall can extend to $0.05. We expect a decisive breakout or breakdown within the next few days.TRON CEO Justin Sun announced that Tron has joined Blockfolio Signal beta, which is a popular mobile cryptocurrency portfolio tracking and management network. Justin Sun?ôs war of words with its competitors, Ethereum and EOS, also continues. He said that his company will create a¬†fund to ?úrescue??the developers of Ethereum and EOS, following a ?úcollapse??of their platforms.For the past few days, the bulls are facing a stiff resistance at the 20-day EMA, which is sloping down. The price has gradually drifted close to the Nov. 25 low of $0.01089965. A break of the low will resume the downtrend that can stretch to $0.00844479.If the bulls scale the overhead resistance of the 20-day EMA, a rally to $0.0183 is probable. We expect the¬†TRX/USD pair to remain range bound for a few days before making the next decisive move.A breakout above $0.0183 will signal strength and can be traded on the long side.Binance Coin made a large move during the week on the back of the announcement regarding upcoming release of Binance Chain. Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) hopes to host millions of coins and thousands of blockchains on the platform in the future.The upcoming launch of Binance?ôs decentralized exchange (DEX) also boosted sentiment. The constant complain of the naysayers has been a lack of mainstream usability. However, with a partnership with Tripio, Binance has offered the opportunity of using BNB at¬†450,000 hotel locations. Though the fundamentals are improving, let?ôs see what the chart forecasts.The BNB/USD pair gave up a lot of ground between Nov. 14 to Nov. 25. During this period, the price dropped by about 53 percent. Thereafter, the bulls attempted to bounce from the critical support zone of $4.8355125-$4.5200621. The pullback broke out of the 20-day EMA, which was trending down but the bulls could not sustain the higher levels.The digital currency turned around and slumped sharply on Dec. 6 and 7, resulting in a new low. The bears are attempting to resume the downtrend, while the bulls are trying to pull back from the current levels. The RSI is showing a positive divergence, which is a bullish sign. We anticipate a trend change if the price breaks out of $7 levels. Traders should wait for a new buy setup to form before investing.Though¬†Bitcoin is the fifth best performer in the past seven days, it has continued to make new year-to-date lows. The SEC postponing the decision on the Bitcoin ETF did not go well with investors. The experts are divided whether the digital currency will slip further or will it bounce off the current levels. Let?ôs see what the charts forecast.The¬†BTC/USD pair gathered momentum on the downside after it broke below the critical support of $5,900. The RSI on the weekly chart has slipped into the oversold territory for the first time since early 2015. The previous dip into the oversold zone had proven to be a good buying point, as the markets then entered a prolonged bull phase.The $3,000-$3,500 zone had previously acted as a support in mid-September 2017. Therefore, we anticipate a bounce from this zone this time too. If successful, we expect a retest of the breakdown levels of $5,900. ¬†Hence, we have been on the lookout to buy.On the other hand, if the bears break below the support zone, the next major support is way lower at $2,000.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

prices and expect Bitcoin to bottom out around $3,000 or even $1,500.",24-Nov-18,"The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.","The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.At the start of the year, the total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies was above $828 billion and many expected it to touch $1 trillion. However, after the hype of last year, the current bear market has been bone-crushing with no end in sight. The bloodbath in cryptocurrencies has plunged total market capitalization to below $130 billion and falling.After the recent collapse, many analysts have forecast a further fall in prices and expect Bitcoin to bottom out around $3,000 or even $1,500. Others, however, believe that the fall is a good opportunity to buy for the long-term, as they believe that the fundamentals are improving.Another important recent development was that the costly Bitcoin Cash war has ended, with Bitcoin Cash SV deciding to move on, leaving Bitcoin Cash ABC in charge of the Bitcoin Cash brand name. Whether or not this will result in a pullback in crypto prices remains to be seen.NEM (XEM) is the best performer among the top cryptocurrencies in the past seven days, though it has slumped about 18 percent, showing bear dominance across markets.Though the bears succeeded in breaking down the range, they are struggling to sustain prices at lower levels. Buying at lower levels has kept the XEM/USD pair close to the range of $0.07790717??0.13125258.The 20-day EMA has turned down and the RSI is in the negative territory, which shows that the bears have an upper hand. If they succeed in sustaining below the range, the fall can extend to the next support level at $0.05.On the other hand, if the bulls defend the bottom of the range and push prices higher, a range bound action is likely to ensue. A trend reversal will be signaled after the price sustains above the range. In such a case, the rally can carry the digital currency to $0.2. We suggest traders wait for the trend to change and a new uptrend to start before venturing out to buy it.Ripple (XRP) continues to be in the news as it announces new partnerships with various banks across the world. Though it has tied up with a few large banks elsewhere, it is yet to make an impact in the U.S. The latest rumor was that it might seal a deal with Bank of America, which would give a major boost to the digital currency.Such rumors are a great buying opportunity during a bull phase. However, during a bear phase, traders should be careful while buying the rumor because if it turns out to be false, prices might plunge.After holding out the week before last, the XRP/USD pair succumbed to selling in the past week. The pair has dipped close to the first support at $0.37185. If this support breaks, a retest of the year-to-date low of $0.24508 is probable. The zone between $0.22 and $0.24508 is likely to act as strong support.Long-term investors can wait for the prices to stabilize at lower levels and then buy a portion of their desired allocation. The remainder can be added at higher levels as the digital currency starts a new uptrend.If the bulls defend the $0.37185 level, the virtual currency will continue to remain in a tight range of $0.37185??0.565. We anticipate a pickup in momentum if the bulls scale the overhead resistance of $0.7644. The target to watch on the upside is $1.28372. Though $0.96490 might act as a minor resistance, we expect it to be crossed. ¬†The number of on-chain transactions on the EOS (EOS) network tops that of other popular cryptocurrencies, according to Blockchain Center. A report by BitMEX, a Bitcoin/dollar derivatives market based in Seychelles, has raised various question marks regarding EOS and has said that the protocol has a long way to go if it wants to challenge the dominance of Ethereum in the DApp world.The EOS/USD pair broke down through critical support at $3.8723, marking a new year-to-date low. If the price sustains below this level, the fall can extend to the next lower level of $3 and below that to $2.1531.The down sloping 20-week EMA and the RSI below 40 levels show that the path of least resistance is to the downside. The bearish view will be invalidated if the bulls quickly push the price above $3.8723 and scale the $4.49 mark. A trend change will be signaled if the digital currency breaks out of the $6.8299 range.Last year after Thanksgiving, Bitcoin (BTC) started its scorching rally that peaked at $19,531.9, rising 144 percent within a month. However, this year, the digital currency is in a firm bear grip and is struggling to hold on to support levels.Many have declared that the crypto bubble has burst and it?ôs all downhill from here. Bitcoin, however, has seen worse falls than these in the past and has recovered on every occasion.The launches of Intercontinental Exchange-backed trading platform Bakkt and a crypto asset custody service by Fidelity in 2019 are poised to attract the institutional money that has been slow to enter the asset class. A favorable decision on a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the U.S. could also result in the start of a new uptrend.The BTC/USD pair extended its downtrend and easily broke below the minor resistances of $5,450 and $5,000. Though the next logical support is way lower at $2,974??3,504.99, we expect some support close to the $4,100 mark. The RSI is about to enter into the oversold territory for the first time since January 2015, which shows the extent of damage in the current fall.Any recovery will face a slew of resistances at $5,000, $5,450 and at $5,900. It is risky to try to catch a falling knife; hence, traders should wait for the virtual currency to find some buying support before entering long positions. ¬†In a series of blog posts, the IOTA (MIOTA) foundation has announced that it is looking to remove the so-called Coordinator from the IOTA network. As the Foundation claims, this move will be a major step towards decentralization for the protocol.Recently automotive industry app developer High Mobility announced a partnership with IOTA. Under the new collaboration, developers at High Mobility will build new types of mobility apps based on IOTA?ôs ledger.The bears broke below the support at $0.4037 and continued lower, touching an intraweek low of $0.28. Currently, the MIOTA/USD pair is attempting to climb above $0.3193.The down sloping 20-week EMA and the RSI in the negative territory show that every pullback will be met with selling pressure. If the support at $0.28 breaks, the fall can extend to the next lower level at $0.1427, with a minor support close to $0.23 levels.On the other hand, if the price recovers from the current levels and rises above $0.4037, the digital currency might consolidate for a few weeks before attempting to start a new uptrend. We suggest traders wait for the trend to change before buying.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Big players include Fidelity and New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) operator Intercontinental Exchange (ICE).Pompliano argued that the recent ?úwash-out??on the crypto markets is a barometer of retail investor patterns; throughout its retail-driven history in 2017, the cryptocurrency traded as a ?úhighly volatile speculative asset.??By contrast, he continued, more recent institutional involvement is primarily conducted via less transparent over-the-counter (OTC) trades, where trends are not immediately apparent and harder to gain insight into.Pompliano was lastly asked about dwindling profit margins for cryptocurrency miners as the asset?ôs value tumbles. He conceded that outside of regions with abundant low cost power, such as China ??where he claimed miners can mint Bitcoin for as little as $2,000-2,500 ??we are seeing a similar ?úwash out??of miners in areas where electricity costs push expenses closer to $6,000 or $6,500.

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.","The market data is provided by the¬†HitBTC exchange.After the first signs of recovery, the opinion is¬†divided on the current pullback in the market. Some say that it is only a dead cat bounce, while others believe that it is the start of a base building process that will result in a new uptrend. Michael Bucella of the crypto-focused investment firm BlockTower Capital said to¬†CNBC that the smartest money has started investing.Nonetheless, Paul Donovan, Global Chief Economist at UBS, has said the digital currencies can¬†never be currencies and are ?úfatally flawed.??After the recent fall, many are questioning the longevity of cryptocurrencies. The past rallies and sharp plunges show that the nascent asset class swings between periods of extreme optimism and pessimism.For the non-believers, this is not the space to be in. However, for the investors who believe in the long-term story of cryptocurrencies, Ric Edelman, founder and executive chairman of Edelman Financial Services, believes that it is a¬†good time to start buying Bitcoin.Will we or anyone pick the exact bottom? No! A bottom can only be identified in the hindsight. Therefore, the traders can scale in the position, gradually building a portfolio. Let?ôs see which virtual currencies are showing buy setups.Contrary to our opinion, the pullback in¬†Bitcoin did not even reach the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement level of $4,712.89. It turned down from $4,471.1 on November 29. This shows that the bears are unwilling to wait for higher levels to sell. ¬†There is a minor support at the small uptrend line, below which a retest of the lows at $3,620.26 is possible. A breakdown of the year-to-date lows is likely to attract further selling, dragging the¬†BTC/USD pair to $3,000 levels. This is an important level that should hold: a break of this can result in a plunge to $2,410.However, we expect the $3,500-$3,000 zone to hold. Hence, traders who went long on our recommendation can hold their positions. We shall close the position if we find that the bears are sustaining below $3,500.If the price bounces from the current levels, it can move up to $4,712.89 and $5,050.4. We can add more positions as the virtual currency rises northwards.Ripple triggered our suggested buy level on Nov. 28, but it could not rise above $0.4. Currently, the price has turned down and might retest the intraday lows of Nov. 25.The down trending 20-day EMA and the RSI below 40 levels will continue to attract sellers. A break below the support line of the descending channel can result in a drop to $0.24508. However, if the support holds, we anticipate a move back to the top of the range. Traders who have bought positions on our recommendation can hold with a stop loss of $0.3. The positions can be closed if the¬†XRP/USD pair sustains below $0.3.The rebound in¬†Ethereum fizzled out at $127.87. It continues to be in a downtrend but for the past seven days it has been trading inside the range $130.5-$102.2.A breakout of the range might face a minor resistance at the 20-day EMA, but we expect it to be crossed. The¬†ETH/USD pair will face a stiff resistance at $167.32 and if this level is crossed, it will be at the 50-day SMA. We suggest traders wait for a trend reversal to be signaled before attempting long positions in it.Bitcoin Cash has extended its stay in the tight range of $204.76-$148.27. The longer the price remains in the range, the stronger the eventual breakout or breakdown will be.Both the moving averages are trending down and the RSI is in the oversold zone, which shows that the bears are in command. We had anticipated a breakout to the upside as the selling had been sharp and the¬†BCH/USD pair was looking oversold. But a lack of buying and selling by the bears is threatening a breakdown of the range.If the price sustains below $148.27, the slide can extend to the next support of $100. On the other hand, if the bulls hold the bottom of the range and breakout of $204.76, we expect a rally to $242.9 and $272.14. Aggressive traders can ride this move up but as this is a counter-trend trade, please keep the position size small.When a support breaks down, it becomes the new resistance. The stronger the support, the stronger the resistance will be.¬†Stellar has turned down from close to the overhead resistance of $0.184.The bears will try to breakdown the recent lows of $0.13427050 and plunge the¬†XLM/USD pair to $0.08 levels. On the contrary, the bulls will try to defend the zone between $0.13427050 and $0.1547188. We shall turn positive on the virtual currency if the price sustains above $0.184.EOS is in a strong downtrend. After a day?ôs pullback, the fall has resumed and the price has made a new year-to-date low. The next support on the downside is at $2.4.The failure of the¬†EOS/USD pair to breakout of the downtrend line shows that the bears are in command. The traders should wait for the digital currency to put in a bottom and show signs of stabilizing before going long.Litecoin remains in a downtrend, with both the moving averages trending down and the RSI in the negative territory. The pullback stalled just above the $36 levels, which shows a lack of buying at higher levels.The bears will attempt to make a new year-to-date low, while the bulls will try to defend the current lows. If the bears succeed, the¬†LTC/USD pair can correct to $20 levels.However, if the bulls use the current fall to buy and form a higher low, it will indicate strength. The digital currency will show first signs of a trend change, if it sustains above the downtrend line. Until then, it remains vulnerable to a bear attack.The sellers did not even wait for the recovery to reach the 20-day EMA before offloading their positions.¬†Cardano can retest the recent lows of $0.033065 within the next few days. If the bears break the support and make a new year-to-date low, the drop can extend to $0.025954 levels.On the other hand, if the bulls manage to hold the support, the¬†ADA/USD pair might start a bottoming process. A trend change will be indicated when the price makes a series of higher highs and higher lows. Until then, the bears are likely to pounce on any pullback.The pullback in¬†Monero was short-lived. Failure of the bulls to reach the first overhead resistance of $71 indicates lack of buying interest. The trend remains firmly down with both the moving averages sloping down and the RSI close to the oversold levels.A break below the $53 levels will resume the downtrend and can plunge the¬†XMR/USD pair to the next support at $40. If the bulls defend the psychological support of $50, it will indicate buying at lower levels and will increase the probability of a bottom formation. Traders should wait for a new buy setup to form before initiating any new positions.The sharp pullback in¬†TRON ended just above the 20-day EMA. Currently, the bears are attempting to push prices towards the recent lows.The trend remains down and the bears have successfully defended the first resistance level, which shows that the sellers are in command. If the¬†TRX/USD pair sinks below $0.01089965, the next target on the downside is $0.00844479.On the other hand, if the bulls manage to hold prices above the Nov. 25 intraday low, the digital currency might enter a consolidation. There are no signs of a trend reversal yet.The market data is provided by the¬†HitBTC exchange.

15, resulting in two competing chains Bitcoin ABC and Bitcoin SV. As ...",22-Nov-18,Over the last 10 days the cryptocurrency markets have endured a massive sell-off across the board.,"There are a number of reasons that have led to the highly bearish sentiments on the market but seeing red has been difficult for many. As the value of Bitcoin and numerous altcoins have continued to decline to depressing levels, and a certain amount of panic has ensued.Cointelegraph has reached out to various industry professionals to explore the reasons behind this most recent slump in the market and what to possibly expect in the coming weeks and months.To understand why the markets have plunged into the red, one must explore the varying socioeconomic factors that have had a negative effect with investor sentiment on traditional and cryptocurrency markets.Renowned Wall Street investor, Tom Lee, provides an astute analysis of the current crypto climate.Firstly, Lee points to the recent Bitcoin Cash fork has been a major talking point over the past few weeks and the build up to the hash rate war caused serious uncertainty in the market. Last week Coinshares CSO, Meltem Demirors, said this has led to institutional investors taking money out to avoid the risk and uncertainty around the hard fork.The contentious¬†split in the Bitcoin Cash blockchain occurred on November 15, resulting in two competing chains Bitcoin ABC and Bitcoin SV. As a result, the value of BCH has suffered just as much as the rest.In addition to this, Lee believes that regulatory pressures have played a role in the bearish atmosphere, highlighting the SEC?ôs decision to institute the first ever levies against a couple Initial Coin Offerings (ICO) that were deemed to have actually been securities offerings. Another contributor to negative sentiments are reports of fresh investigations into the affairs of controversial stablecoin Tether (USDT).Global pressures have also taken their toll and Lee points to trade tensions, central banks tightening up policies, as well as Brexit contributing to declining market liquidity.The outlook for traditional markets have been just as bleak, with analysts forecasting a looming ?úflash crash??in the wake of a sell off in the cryptocurrency and oil markets. Lee summed this up as a sign of the times:?úMarkets around the world are fragile and panic and sentiment are playing a disproportionate role right now. Does this mean Bitcoin is broken? No. The use case is still there but in the short term, panics are panics.?ùeToro senior market analyst, Mati Greenspan, echoed these sentiments, highlighting the downtrend in various global stock markets in his daily market updates over the past few days.NASDAQ Composite 5-days chart. Source: Yahoo FinanceS&P 500 5-days chart. Source: Yahoo FinanceDow Jones Industrial Average 5-days chart. Source: Yahoo FinanceCombined with a recent breakout and central banks tightening their belts, the markets have seen a swathe of red. As the Wall Street Journal reported midweek, governments may need to stimulate their own economies as central banks tighten their belts.Economic tensions have also affected global trade and higher interest rates aren?ôt helping the situation, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.As Greenspan explained, all of these factors have contributed to the stresses across multiple markets.?úThere are a lot of side stories at the moment but I feel the major driving factors are the technical breakout that we saw last week and the global macroeconomic cycle that is currently hitting the stock market. In 2017 we saw abundance across all markets due to central bank loose money policy. Now that the central banks are raising rates again, money may become scarce and people are taking a lot of their investments off the table.?ùWhile the Bitcoin Cash fork has been identified as a major factor in this most recent downturn, others have pointed to the fact that the crypto markets have showed signs of a serious decline in recent weeks.As previously reported by Cointelegraph, analysts noted that Bitcoin was struggling to move into an uptrend support. The preeminent cryptocurrency was unable to move past the lower $6,000 regions. Trade volumes and activity were low and uncertainty grew, leading to the aggressive selloff.Gabor Gurbacs, digital asset strategist and director at VanEck, told Cointelegraph that traditional markets had endured corrections as businesses looked to consolidate before the end of the year.?úDuring the past month, however, Bitcoin and digital assets were fairly stable while the equity and bond markets have gone through a significant correction. The recent turbulence is due to the combination of some systematic end of the year selling (that is businesses are closing their books) and some mess around the Bitcoin Cash fork.?ùIn line with this analysis, Anthony Pompliano, host of popular crypto podcast and newsletter ?úOff The Chain,??has been addressing the current market woes over the past fews days. Responding to Cointelegraph, Pompliano highlighted three driving factors for the recent downturn:?úTechnicals showing more downward movement, historical analysis shows we need to go further, and psychological argument is there is not enough blood in the streets. Add in the selling pressure from funds and ICOs, you get a perfect storm for further market contraction.?ùSimply put, the low trade volumes and high uncertainty caused a sell-off that led to further panic selling. Summing this up succinctly, respected blockchain entrepreneur and industry advisor, Vinny Lingham, offered Cointelegraph a collected analysis of the current climate:?úIt's a usual downtrend in the bear market that has characterized much of 2018. The recent Bitcoin Cash contentious fork, combined with regulatory uncertainty regarding ICOs with recent SEC decisions against some token sales, added to the overall negative sentiment.?ùPrice predictions are notoriously difficult to make in the cryptocurrency sphere but analysts are able to glean a lot from price movements and charts.According to Greenspan, it is not easy to make any assumptions of what the markets will do in the next six weeks and he believes things could go either way:?úIt's impossible to say for sure. Now that Bitcoin has broken the key psychological level of $5,000 the next logical level of support we can spot on the graph isn't until $3,000. It doesn't necessarily have to get there though. If it turns around now it would be a very bullish sign indeed.?úI feel like the last of the panic sellers are now showing their hands. There are many cryptotraders who are happy to go on hodling even if we do see lower prices. As well, the incoming large financial institutions are most likely accumulating already at these prices.?ùPompliano offered a more philosophical outlook in his latest newsletter, highlighting the fundamental aspects of Bitcoin as a saving grace that cannot be controlled or enforced by any single entity:?úIt is important to remember that Bitcoin is not a traditional asset. There is no monetary policy decision that will be the catalyst for a recovery. The government can?ôt deem it too big to fail. There is no one who can step in and halt trading. Bitcoin lives and dies on its own.?úWhile that may be scary to traditional market investors, this is the attraction to true crypto believers. They understand the asset will have volatile swings on a frequent basis. They know that there are few synthetic protections in place for investors. Bitcoin is the ultimate test: How much conviction do you truly have??ùEven at current levels, Lee has produced a fairly optimistic outlook for the cryptocurrency markets before the end of the year. Lee reiterated his $15,000 Bitcoin price prediction earlier this week, even amid deepening lows. Lee believes further regulatory clarity will also ease uncertainty, which has gripped the space for most of 2018.The Fundstrat co-founder believes that institutional investors will be the driving force behind a market resurgence. This will be led by the predicted launch of Bakkt in January 2019, a digital assets platform created by The Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), the operator of leading global exchanges, including the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).The bearish climate led to Lingham producing a far more conservative outlook leading into December and the new year. He said it was hard to see Bitcoin breaking past $6,000 in 2018 ??and stressed the need for blockchain projects to create widely usable solutions:?úThe market needs to find and prove more use cases, companies that are building on top of blockchain need to prove real utility. The industry needs to start to show technology adoption beyond pilots in 2019 and create value add. The market has had too many pipe dreams and Lambos in the past 2 years. The climate can change once more companies with solid use cases emerge from their development cycles, gain traction and prove sound business value to make a difference. Ones who won't hit these milestones will continue to be wiped out.?ùAs of November 22, the crypto markets look to have stopped their drastic slide, with cryptocurrencies??prices still being shaky, but seeing only mild losses.Source: Coin360.io",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EOS and Steemit executive Daniel Larimer has revealed ...",29-Nov-18,"Daniel Larimer, the CTO of blockchain company and EOS developer Block.One, has plans to develop a new cryptocurrency side project, he said in Telegram messages Nov. 28.","Larimer, also known as BM in developer circles, gave only vague information about plans for a ?úhypothetical token,??which would be ?úimmutable, non-programmable, and limited to a currency role.?ùThe token, if launched, would mark the latest contribution from Larimer to the altcoin world, the developer also holding the titles of co-founder of blockchain social network Steemit and creator of DAO BitShares.On Telegram Wednesday, Larimer said he had ?ústumbled upon??the concept for a new currency-focused token while working on EOS ?úsecurity and scalability.?ù‚Ä?..I stumbled upon a new set of tradoffs [sic] for a potential crypto token and I have merely been exploring whether there is a market for those tradeoffs,??he wrote in the public Telegram group.Along with refuting claims that he plans to quit EOS, Larimer added that the token ?úwould in no way compromise the much larger use cases??for the platform.In a separate Telegram group the same day, a long list of attributes for the token appeared, with Larimer giving it the bizarre title ?úMonerEOS????seemingly a mash-up of privacy-focused altcoin Monero (XMR) and EOS.?úCrypto people will hate it,??he claimed in a message.EOS has courted controversy in recent weeks after moderators reversed previously-confirmed transactions, leading to renewed criticism of its governance model.Larimer had said in October that EOS was not focused on providing decentralization.At the same time, Steemit has also encountered fresh teething problems, this week announcing it was making over two-thirds of its workforce redundant.Perhaps unsurprisingly in the current climate, commentators reacted coolly to the new token.?úDan Larimer is already working on his next project... which sounds like Bitcoin but I bet he needs a lot of funding for it first,??Twitter pundit and investor WhalePanda wrote Nov. 29.Reddit responses also focused on the developer?ôs reputation, insinuating that Larimer?ôs previous projects had suffered from his tendency to shift gears quickly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Revenues",https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-crypto-market-fall-influences-mining-hardware-sales-and-producers-revenues,"But Bitcoin mining has, at least for now, and most likely in the future, 
moved into the court of bigger players with deep pockets.??Miners' 
Revenues ...",19-Nov-18,"A year long bear crypto market appears to have had a negative impact on the profitability of cryptocurrency mining. In spite of this, Bitcoin miners still managed to generate $4.7 billion in profit in the first six months of 2018. Constantly growing competition between big mining pools and the increasing difficulty of Bitcoin?ôs algorithm make getting the first cryptocurrency less profitable and weight the scales against small players.","Miners shut off their machines, and card manufacturers suffer losses. In particular, AMD representatives, whose last quarter fiscal report, published on Oct. 24, demonstrated that revenues from the sale of mining Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) were ?únegligible.??Presumably, Nvidia and Bitmain could also be in the same predicament and at this point, investors, miners and GPU manufacturers are probably all wondering what it will take to shake the cryptocurrency market from its current malaise.A year ago, the situation on the mining hardware market was different. Jon Peddie Research shows that in 2017, miners bought 3 million devices for more than $700 million, with Bitmain having the estimated share of $3-4 billion, which surpassed Nvidia?ôs and AMD?ôs revenues for the same period.The increase in the supply of GPU cards, which was observed in the second quarter of last year, can be primarily linked to the growing demand among Ethereum (ETH) miners, according to Jon Peddie Research. A similar leap was already seen in 2013 as a result of a massive purchase of Bitcoin and Litecoin by miners.The demand for Ethereum led to evolution in the GPU market as professional Bitcoin miners switched over from GPUs to custom ASICs resulting in a further surplus of mining graphics cards on the secondary market.Amid increasing demand, mining equipment prices grown sharply ??the cost of flagship chips rose by 25 percent, with Nvidia?ôs GeForce 1080 commanding more than¬†$1,000 during the market peak.Since the Bitcoin's dive in January, when in just a month it lost half of its value from the $20,000 landmark high, the situation for miners worsened ??the price of the currency broke the mark of $5,800, and card manufacturers announced the decline in the revenues from mining hardware sales.These factors led to a drop in mining devices prices. As earlier reported by Cointelegraph, in July AMD?ôs OEM 4GB RX 580 six-pack was sold out at the price of $2,500, while in April it was available for $3,600. An Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 Founders Edition, 8GB GDDR5X PCI Express 3.0 Graphics Card was sold out at a price tag of $1,050 in the same month, though in July its price wasn?ôt higher than $709.Despite the fall in the cryptocurrency market, Bitcoin miners' revenues over the first three quarters of 2018 amounted to a record $4.7 billion, with a monthly profit of 57,000 BTC. For example, the entire past year brought users $1.4 billion less. However, the ever-increasing competition and growing network complexity make mining Bitcoin less profitable, especially for small players, as reported in the latest study made by the analytical company Diar.Nevertheless, analysts state that September was the first month when private miners??profits went into the negative due to the increase of computing power.According to Diar, only large pools can still earn on Bitcoin mining:?úWith big mining operations on low electricity costs running at anywhere between 50-60 percent gross profit from Bitcoin revenues, the market has a lot of room left to grow and, profits to squeeze. But Bitcoin mining has, at least for now, and most likely in the future, moved into the court of bigger players with deep pockets.?ùMiners??total income was also not at the point of growth, as 2018?ôs stats ($11.5 million) is 21 percent lower than $14.7 million value of the same period last year, and significantly lower than the maximum revenue of $53 million observed during the High Yield Investment Program (HYIP) era in mid-December 2017.Bitcoin miners may have run a losing business since the end of September ??this conclusion was made by analyst Barclay James, who calculated a special formula to find the price of Bitcoin at which miners would no longer generate enough profit to cover operational costs. The value obtained is within the range of $6,400-6,500 per coin. A lower threshold was offered by the other analytical agency called Fundstrat, which analysts suggested that most miners may leave their rigs if Bitcoin drop $3,000-$4,000 per Bitcoin.Massive abandonment of the market by owners of small mining farms in China as a result of a prolonged ?úbearish??cryptocurrency market speaks about the decline in private miners??interest.One of these miners tells that in the second half of 2017, when cryptocurrency prices reached a historic high, he invested hundreds of thousands of yuan in the purchase of nearly a hundred devices. The expectations were not met, the miner confesses:?úBy mid-June, my mining business?ôs profit margin had dropped by 90 percent. One of my friends who also mines altcoins suffered more, nearly losing all his investment.?ùThe decreasing interest of miners towards graphics cards is not the only reason for the decline in the mining equipment production market, analysts from Jon Peddie Research explained. The company has published its Q2 2018 report containing data on the GPU market in general and the segment of discrete video cards in particular. The April?ìJune?ôs figures were more modest than the statistics of the last quarter, which is also explained by the seasonal factor ??the figures for the second quarter are usually smaller than those for the first one ??as suggested by analysts.Overall GPU shipments increased 0.2 percent since the last quarter. AMD?ôs shipments decreased -1 percent, Nvidia?ôs -7.5 percent, while Intel increased their shipments by 2.6 percent.The negative trend is also demonstrated by year-to-year numbers. Total GPU shipments decreased -3.3 percent, with discrete GPUs down -4 percent from the last quarter.Did the fall of the cryptocurrency market affect the stock indexes of mining hardware colossi? A closer look at AMD and Nvidia charts show that the decline in share value was likely caused by a decrease in sales, rather than by cryptocurrency market correction.AMD stocks fell by 9 percent, after Oct. 26, the company published a quarterly report. Within a month, the company?ôs shares prices dropped by nearly 48 percent and experts believe that the main reason behind this decline was the fall of miners??interest in video cards.Kinngai Chan, an analyst at the Summit Insights Group, told Reuters that ?úAMD had too high an exposure to the crypto-currency market,??meaning that miner's acquisitions have significantly increased the company's revenues.AMD?ôs fiscal report has also shown that the actual revenues decline of $150 million instead of $50 million expected. The surplus of GPU cards was formed due to the cryptocurrency boom in the first half of the year, which forced AMD to ?úramp up??the production of core products.Though mining represents a ""very small percentage"" of the company?ôs overall business, according to AMD CEO Lisa Su, on Nov. 5 it has announced the partnership with seven major tech companies to produce eight new cryptocurrency mining rigs boasting ?úUltimate stability,????4/7 performance?? and ?úEnterprise-level quality.??The main reason of this production is said to be meeting the various aspirations of ?úinnovative blockchain platforms,??which can be also related to the company?ôs expectations of the GPU sales for miners in 2019.AMD is not the only chip producer which stocks have been affected by the state of cryptocurrency markets. Nvidia?ôs shares fell by 4 percent after its Q3 report estimations announcement on Aug. 16, which demonstrated that its revenue from the sale of video cards in the second quarter of 2018 amounted to $18 million instead of the expected $100 million. In total, October?ôs drop comprised nearly 36 percent, with the stocks prices falling from $289 on Oct. 1, to $185 on Oct. 29. Nvidia?ôs Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress told the Wall Street Journal:?úWhereas we had previously anticipated cryptocurrency to be meaningful for the year, we are now projecting no contributions going forward.""The final Q3 fiscal report, published by the company on Nov. 15, revealed that demand for Nvidia?ôs GPUs among crypto miners has dried up, as reported by Cointelegraph. The overall reported revenue for Q3 comprised $3.18 billion, which is 21 percent higher compared to $2.64 billion the last year, and 2 percent higher than the previous quarter value. However, the latest numbers occurred to be lower than the company expected. In August Nvidia?ôs analysts predicted its Q3 revenue to be between $3.19 billion and $3.32 billion.The manufacturer?ôs founder Jensen Huang added that the company?ôs revenues for the next year could be reconsidered since ?únear-term results reflect excess channel inventory post the cryptocurrency boom, which will be corrected.?ùDecreasing revenues can have also been driven by the increased competitiveness of Bitmain. In March, Wall Street firm Susquehanna has changed the rating of AMD from neutral to negative and lowered the price forecast for shares in GPU processing manufacturer Nvidia, citing the growing competition from Bitmain?ôs ETH mining ASICs. The new target price for AMD shares was revised from $13.00 to $7.50, and Nvidia?ôs forecast was decreased from $215 to $200 at Friday?ôs market close.The dominance of ETH ASIC miners could negatively affect AMD and Nvidia, according to analyst Christopher Rolland from Susquehanna Financial, companies whose graphics cards for ETH mining comprise 20 and 10 percent of the companies??respected revenues.While GPU cards prices haven?ôt dropped significantly, Bitmain has been deliberately selling its latest and the flagmanship Bitcoin ASIC Antminer S9 at a discount, BitMEX Research reported.In total for the last year and the first quarter of 2018 Bitmain reportedly sold about two million Antminer S9 models. According to the researchers, who calculated the disclosed gross profit margin of the company in 2017 and the indicative cost of each ASIC chip, Bitmain?ôs profit margin for the Antminer S9 occurred to be negative with the value of 11.6 percent.Crypto analyst, Samson Mow, critical about Bitmain?ôs activity, has calculated that Antminer S9 prices had dropped by 85%, and the company had lost $600-700 millions in Q2.Why is Bitmain raising capital so fast & only showing Q1 results to pre-IPO investors? We're well into Q3 now. The reason is Q2 was a disaster. Bitmain is sitting on a massive $1.24 billion USD in inventory & S9 prices dropped by ~85%! Q2 losses range in the $600-700 millions. pic.twitter.com/fVYcDRTvBpHowever, decreased prices have nothing to do with the miners??falling interest ??researchers suggest that the company employed a strategy to outsell its competition by underpricing its products:?úThese low prices are likely to be a deliberate strategy by Bitmain, to squeeze out their competition by causing them to experience lower sales and therefore financial difficulties. In our view, herein lies the key to one of the main driving forces behind the decision to IPO. A successful IPO may increase the firepower available to continue this strategy and eliminate an advantage rivals could have by doing their IPOs first.?ùA more serious threat that may affect the viability of ASIC miners, and the sales of the mining giant, are hard forks of mineable coins, to which more and more companies took a stake in. In 2018, at least two projects held hard fork to protect their networks against 51 percent attacks, and this threatens Bitmain?ôs monopoly in the market, with two of them planning it in the near future.In April, Monero?ôs fork disabled mining with Antminer X3, in October, Sia disabled Antminer A3. Their upgrades are followed by scheduled hard forks of Bitcoin Cash (BCH) (Nov. 15) and Ethereum (presumably in January 2019), which could potentially devalue Antminer S9 and E3, designed for the mining of these coins.To strengthen its position on the market Bitmain continues to compete with other mining hardware producers. On Nov. 5, the company has released two new Antminer models, equipped with next-generation ASIC chips to ensure¬†?úindustry-leading hashrates.?ù¬†Announced on October 22, ?úOvert ASICBoost??firmware upgrade, which was designed to increase mining devices efficiency, along with the deployment of 90,000 Antminers S9 being carried out by Bitmain to get the mining pool dominance ahead of the Bitcoin Cash hard fork, can potentially increase the company?ôs revenues of Q3 2018.The decline in demand is also confirmed by smaller video card manufacturers. Gigabyte recently published a financial report for the last month, which showed that its revenue in June fell by 31 percent compared to last year and by 30 percent compared to the previous month. Additionally, revenues for the second quarter of 2018 fell by 33 percent compared to the first, according to the report.A similar situation faces TUL Corporation, which produces video cards under the PowerColor brand. The company's earnings for June occurred to be 28 percent lower than in May. For the entire second quarter, the decline was 59 percent compared to Q1. The numbers are significant, given that up to 95 percent of the company's revenue comes directly from the sale of AMD video cards.The opposite financial results have been reported by Canadian mining hardware producer Hut 8, on Nov. 8. As stated in its fiscal document, the company?ôs revenue reached a record $13.5 million for Q3 (126 percent higher than for the same period in 2017), and $27.7 million for last three quarters.Hut 8 attributed the increase to its set up of sixteen Bitfury BlockBoxes in September at its mining facility in the City of Medicine Hat, for an aggregate of 56 BlockBoxes at that site. Each BlockBox reportedly contains 176 mining servers and has a hashrate of 13.7 Ph/s.Among the reasons the company gives for the lower financial results in 2017, there is the BTC price drop, the increased competition, and the record high temperatures in Alberta. Hut 8 also expects that the efficiency of ASIC chips will rise during the colder months, which will improve performance in the next quarter.Another manufacturer said that the profit it received in Q3 2018 exceeded that for the same period last year, despite the fact that its revenues for cryptocurrency mining business were down due to the ?úworsening external environment??and ?úincreasing depreciation cost.?ùOn Nov. 12, Japanese IT giant GMO Internet has released its Q3 fiscal report revealing that company?ôs crypto-related activity, including mining hardware production and crypto exchange operation, had brought about $22.8 million in revenue over the third quarter ?úin just a year since the launch.?ùIf the data supplied by researchers and analysts is to be believed, then Bitcoin miners have been operating at a significant loss since June and many individuals have abandoned the practice altogether. The growing hash power of BTC will remain lucrative to those who are able to mine at an industrial scale or operate in countries where the operational and energy costs are favorable. The survival of Bitcoin and the network hashrate remaining within the range between 40 and 50 million This demonstrate that there is still significant activity in the global cryptocurrency mining sector and the confidence of miners may return sooner or later. Smaller scale miners are fleeing in droves and the distribution of players is rebalancing as the emergence and consolidation of mining farms takes place, experts at Diar.co suggest:?úBitcoin mining has, at least for now, and most likely in the future, moved into the court of bigger players with deep pockets.?ùTherefore, ?úbig mining operations on low electricity costs running at anywhere between 50-60 percent gross profit from Bitcoin revenues??will continue to make hefty profits and analysts believe that ?úthe market has a lot of room left to grow and, profits to squeeze.?ùJon Peddie Research also doesn?ôt expect a significant reduction in the price of video cards:""We believe that concerns about the fall in demand for GPU for the production of ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, as well as the significance and impact of these processes on the company's viability, are greatly exaggerated, and Nvidia will most likely be able to overcome these"" hard ""times by focusing on its other directions.?ùAs of current, despite the significant drop in the price of major cryptocurrencies, the demand for cryptocurrency mining remains relatively high as seen in the rise in the hash rate of the Bitcoin network and the expansion of Samsung, GMO, and Bitmain?ôs operations, which activity wasn?ôt affected by grown shipments tariffs and regulations.The last quarter of 2018, and 2019 may see the continuation of Initial Public Offerings (IPOs), which one by one have been announced by Canaan Creative, Ebang Communication, Bitmain, and Bitfury this year.The estimated amount of $20 billion these company are expected to raise at IPO stages in total, and the values of $14 billion and $80 million Bitmain and Bitfury have already reached during their initial funding rounds, suggest that ASIC miners producers may have an alternative way of monetization even in case of decreasing sales.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While a price crash can indicate ...",23-Nov-18,"The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.","Market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.Does a crash in prices indicate the decaying fundamentals of an asset class? In many instances it does, but the market usually gets the fundamentals of an emerging technology wrong, both in the short term and in the long term.In May 1997, Amazon?ôs share price was quoting at $18. Short-term expectations propelled it to $300 by December 1998 and from there it slumped to $6 per share after the dotcom bubble burst. At that point, the market was severely underestimating its potential and the non-believers were claiming victory. However, the model proved everyone wrong, and Amazon became the second company in the history to reach a market capitalization of $1 trillion.Blockchain entrepreneur and industry advisor, Vinny Lingham, said to Cointelegraph: ?úThe climate can change once more companies with solid use cases emerge from their development cycles, gain traction and prove sound business value to make a difference.??Just because the prices have crashed, it doesn?ôt signal the end of an asset class.As the price action in the near-term is dictated by technicals, let?ôs look at the charts and forecast the probable price action.During a waterfall decline, support levels are not honored, making it difficult to predict the bottom. The pullbacks also usually last only for about 1?? days. Bitcoin attempted a recovery on Nov.r 21 that failed at $4,799.74.Subsequently, the BTC/USD pair has resumed its downtrend, making a new low. Both the moving averages are sloping down and the RSI is deep in the oversold territory. This shows that the sellers are in command.The immediate support on the downside is $4,100, below which, the fall can extend to $3,500??$3,000. ¬†Any recovery attempt will face stiff resistance at the downtrend line and $5,000. Though we want to use the current fall to buy, we believe that the traders should wait for a level to hold before initiating any long positions. ¬†Ripple has broken down of the uptrend line, which shows that it is also being affected by negative sentiment. However, it remains well above its lows, which confirms its outperformance.The moving averages have started to turn down and the RSI has dipped below 40, which suggests that the supply is outpacing demand.The next support on the downside is $0.37185 and below that, $0.26913. The XRP/USD pair will point to a consolidation if the prices quickly scale above the uptrend line and the moving averages flatten out. For now, it is best to stay on the sidelines.Ethereum is not finding buyers at higher levels. The pullback stalled at $141.91, which shows a lack of buying support.Currently, the bears are attempting to extend the decline to the next support level at $110. Though anything is possible in the markets, we believe that the oversold levels on the RSI point to a probable pullback. We don not recommend trading on hope, hence, we shall wait for a new buy setup to form before suggesting any trade in it.On the upside, the ETH/USD pair will face a stiff hurdle at $167.32. The 20-day EMA is also close to this level, making it a critical resistance to cross for the bulls.Stellar is at a critical level. If the bears sustain prices below $0.184, it will be negative and can result in the start of a new down move. The lower levels to watch on the downside are $0.1547188 that is the intraday low of March 18 and $0.138565, which is the intraday low hit on Dec. 22 of last year.Conversely, if the bulls successfully defend the $0.184 level, the XLM/USD pair, might pull back to the 20-day EMA and above it to the downtrend line. We suggest traders wait for a new buy setup to form before entering any long positions.Though EOS has broken down of the critical support at $3.8723, it has not plunged. This shows some buying support at lower levels. The oversold reading on the RSI also points to a recovery attempt.If the bulls scale $3.8723, a move to the downtrend line and above it to $4.493 is probable. The 20-day EMA is also located close to this level, hence, $4.493 will act as a major roadblock.If the EOS/USD pair fails to rise above $3.8723, it can slump to $3. We do not find any bullish patterns developing, hence, we are not proposing a trade in it.The bulls have been attempting to hold the support at $32 for the past three days, but have not been able to push Litecoin higher.Still, the oversold levels on the RSI point to a probable pullback. On the upside, the LTC/USD pair will face stiff resistance at the 20-day EMA and above that at the $47.246??49.466 zone.On the other hand, if the bears sink prices below the support zone of $32??29.653, the fall can extend to the next support at $20.The pullback in Cardano could not scale the $0.05 level and the price is back at the support of $0.041.If the ADA/USD pair breaks down and sustains below $0.041, it can slide to the next lower target of $0.025954.On the other hand, if the bulls succeed in rebounding from close to current levels, the digital currency will again attempt to break out of $0.05. If successful, the pullback can extend to $0.060105, which is likely to act a major resistance because this is the previous support and the 20-day EMA is also close to this level.Though the bulls attempted a pullback in Monero on Nov. 21 and 22, they could not push prices above $72. As a result, the price turned down once again.In this down leg, if the XMR/USD pair plunges below $60, the fall can extend to the next support at $46.If the virtual currency finds buyers at the current levels, the bulls will again attempt to break out of the $72 level. If this level is crossed, the pullback can continue to next overhead resistance of $81.TRON could not scale above the previous support-turned-resistance of $0.01587681 in the past two days. However, a small positive is that the bulls have held prices above the Nov. 20 intraday low of $0.0122194.We anticipate the bulls to make another attempt to climb above $0.01587681 and reach the next resistance of $0.0183.However, contrary to our expectation, if the TRX/USD pair plummets below $0.0122194, the fall can extend to the next lower level of $0.00844479.Dash continues to trade near the support of the descending channel. This shows that sellers have the upper hand.Any breakdown of the channel will be a negative development that can push the DASH/USD pair down to the next support at $75.If the support of the channel holds, the bulls will attempt another pullback to scale $120 levels and reach the next overhead resistance of $129.58. We believe that the traders should wait for a trend reversal before initiating any long positions.Market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.

The company has always emphasized that its software is the ?úmost secure??and is invulnerable to hacking attacks.These claims were questioned when, in mid-August 2017, a group of hackers managed to crack Trezor wallets using relatively simple methods, allowing for the theft or identification of private keys from those devices. After an investigation into the incident, Trezor stated that the seed for the hacked wallet?ôs private key was saved on a flash memory card and relocated to the afflicted device?ôs random access memory (RAM) during its use. It was later identified that only Trezor wallets were affected by the vulnerability. In response to the incident, Trezor released the firmware security update version 1.5.2 on Aug. 16 and later claimed that users were safe and had nothing to fear.The attacks were not limited to Trezor, as other devices have been also affected by bugs and bad actors. A report published by SpectreAttack in early January 2018 revealed two bugs, known as Meltdown and Spectre, which were said to exploit security vulnerabilities in Intel, AMD and ARM processors of any device they are installed in. The list of devices included PCs, laptops, tablets and smartphones.The Meltdown bug afflicted Intel chips that were estimated to be installed in about 90 percent of all computers worldwide. The Spectre bug affected Intel, ARM and AMD chips on any device and both types of malware were reported to be capable of operating in cloud storage environments.The Ledger Nano S, another popular hardware wallet, has also been found to be lacking in terms of security. On Feb. 5, 2017, it was discovered that users were open to attacks when connecting their Ledger Nano S to a device compromised by a hacker and using it to transfer funds between accounts on a regular basis. The fraudster could easily replicate the account addresses and gain access to the funds stored therein.In January 2017, the participants of various Bitcoin and blockchain-related conferences were given fake Bitcoin hardware wallets imitating the legitimate products of Trezor and Ledger. Such ruses were aimed at stealing the funds that would be placed on the devices.Earlier, in December 2016, a hacker managed to fake the identity of a user and transferred their phone number from T-Mobile to a carrier called Bandwidth, which was linked to a Google Voice account used by the attacker. The hacker then reset all the victim?ôs passwords and stole dozens of Bitcoins, though the exact amount wasn?ôt revealed.There are numerous vulnerabilities that hackers can exploit to steal hard-earned cryptocurrencies. Notably, software companies are unaware of a large number of tricks that the hackers have up their sleeves, while the latter are developing ever more devious and elaborate schemes to phish out cryptos from their unsuspecting victims.In his blog, Karl Kreder, Ph.D. ??the co-founder of wallet manufacturer Grid+ ??outlines six vulnerabilities based on his personal and professional observations, which could potentially lead to hardware wallets being compromised or hacked.Man-in-the-Middle (MIM) AttackAs observed by Kreder, MIM attacks can affect some cold storage devices, whose screens display eight digits of the recipient address when a user sends the funds. According to the calculations he made in August 2017, hacking into such a device could be implemented for ?úa relatively small economic cost??(about $800) with the use of the address generators like vante.me.Wallets like Ledger and Trezor can be vulnerable when being upgraded via a USB port. This option is often allowed by a manufacturer with the help of so-called USB Device Firmware Upgrade (DFU). As reported, the market has already seen successful attempts to use DFU to remotely dump the memory of the STM32F family of microcontrollers.This could lead to a number of negative consequences for a cold storage device owner, starting with the theft of private keys and ending with a malicious actor re-flashing the wallet with malicious code during an upgrade.As a rule, in case the hardware device is lost or falls into the hands of a bad actor, manufacturers like Trezor and the Ledger reset the wallet if a wrong pin is entered three times. This prevents a fraudster from getting control of the wallet and using a brute-force-based attack to compromise a pin.During the Defcon conference, the Cryptotronix developers demonstrated that the Trezor STM32F205¬†could be glitched by using both Vcc and clock glitching attacks. As a result, the device becomes vulnerable and private keys can be obtained by a third party without needing to know the pin.This is the sort of vulnerability being faced by Trezor One owners who bought fake copies. Originally, a Trezor hardware device is protected with branded holographic stickers and super glue which holds the housing together. This is supposed to protect the wallet from being tampered with after it was sent by the manufacturer to a customer. However, if the device falls into a fraudster?ôs hands, the latter can flash a malicious version of the software or re-insert the key. Once this is done, the device?ôs body is sealed with a similar holographic sticker and glue.The author considers a recovery phrase to be ?úthe most vulnerable piece of the security puzzle,??since this 12??4 word series string usually consists of plain text and is often stored ?úin a sock drawer at one point.?ùAs warned by Edward Snowden, PINs and passwords can be obtained by a spying fraudster spying via an ordinary desktop or smartphone web camera. Cryptocurrencies holders and traders may not be an exception.The community responded to the news about faked Trezor One devices with a mix of outrage and frustration peppered by some understanding. Some pointed to the pathetic security measures taken by Trezor in relying on a holographic sticker as a safety barrier. Others confirmed they bought fake Trezor wallets.I can confirm. I bought 2 on Amazon several months ago, and they have the wrong holographic seal. Never opened them. pic.twitter.com/Emq8ugxIMoMany responsible users commented with calls for vigilance and additional security measures, while opinion leaders remained sided with the legitimate manufacturer. Naturally, a flurry of recommendations and comments ensued as users offered various tips on how to keep their wallets safe ??with suggestions ranging from keeping the wallets under a mattress with a shotgun nearby to leaving the crypto market for good.The faking of devices occupying a market worth about $95 million in 2017 alone was only a matter of time, as it was predicted earlier by some crypto enthusiasts.Though the fake software may not be suitable for crypto storage in the first place, the price difference may be enough to lure unsuspecting users and lead to woe and losses of their funds. Given the fact that today, the majority of cryptocurrencies are held in cold storage, and 97 percent of exchanges prefer to keep the funds this way, the forgery of devices for crypto storage may still remain attractive for fraudsters, according to a study issued by the University of Cambridge.The experts and the manufacturer itself recommend maintaining vigilance when selecting hardware wallets and to purchase them only from verified resellers that can be found in a list on the official Trezor website.Hello Rahul, the main differences are the hologram and barcode on the back of the box. The fake Trezor could be using our firmware, so it is best not to use it. The safest is to buy Trezor from our official shop or resellers.Apart from the main warning given here and there by Trezor - ?úIf you don't own your private keys, you don't own your coins????some experts advise having two cold wallets and not to keep all the funds in one place to diversify the risks.Companies, in their turn, should use their leverage to attempt to stop the imitation of their products through legal channels and to implement additional security measures after extensive analysis of the fake devices, as the community believes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This selloff was reported by local Chinese crypto outlet 8BTC Wednesday, Nov. 21, with reference to the cryptocurrency mining pool F2Pool.","Cryptocurrency markets experienced widespread decline throughout last week, with Bitcoin (BTC) declining to as low as $4,300 per coin.The decline has resulted in a similar drop in mining profitability and forced Chinese operators to sell their mining devices at a loss, according to 8BTC. The news outlet has reported that the miners are being sold ?úby kilo,??citing a post made by the founder of F2Pool on the Weibo microblogging platform.Crypto miners are reportedly especially eager to sell the older models, including Antminer S7, Antminer T9, and Avalon A741, as these have reached their ?úshutdown price.??According to local Chinese outlet Tencent News, the earnings from mining are no longer enough to cover electric power and other associated costs.The market slump has reportedly affected mostly small and medium-sized mining operations in the Chinese regions of Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia. There, 8BTC reports, some mining machines are being sold on the second-hand market for merely 5 percent of their original value. A mining machine bought at a price of up to 20,000 yuan ($2,885) a year ago is reportedly currently sold for just 1,000 yuan ($144).Bitcoin?ôs price has kept falling, along with the rest of the crypto market, since the hard fork network upgrade of Bitcoin Cash (BCH) that took place Nov. 15. The update has led cryptocurrency exchanges around the world to suspend BCH trading and withdrawals.Earlier this month, Bitcoin mining giant Bitmain announced plans to reach out to local mining farms in the coal-rich province of Xinjiang, and deploy around 90,000 Antminer S9 devices in the region. Bitmain?ôs move is reported to be a strategic one in the computing ?úpower war??associated with the BCH hard fork.At press time, the crypto markets have calmed down, with most of the top ten cryptocurrencies seeing only mild losses. BTC has today hovered between $4,450 and $4,630.In September, the CEO of F2Pool published an infographic that indicated that if Bitcoin price would reach lower than 36,792 Chinese yuan (about $5,376), mining the cryptocurrency with an Antminer T9 would become unprofitable. In the case of an S7 model miner, the break-even point amounted to a significantly higher Bitcoin price point of about 79,258 yuan (about $11,581).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

bought some through an ETN based on a Swedish exchange.??According ...",03-Dec-18,"On Nov. 16, Switzerland?ôs primary stock exchange, SIX Swiss Exchange, announced that it will list the world?ôs first multi-crypto-based exchange-traded product (ETP).","Exchange-traded products (ETP) are derivatively priced securities that are traded on a national securities exchange. Their pricing derives its value from other investment instruments, most commonly found in the form of commodities, stocks and indexes.The first global multi-crypto ETP has the backing of Swiss startup Amun AG and will be listed under the ticker symbol HOLD. According to the announcement, the ETP will track five of the sector's biggest cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin (BTC), Ripple (XRP), Ethereum (ETH), Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Litecoin (LTC).The announcement also reveals that each of the five cryptocurrencies will obtain a degree of the market share within the ETP, although Bitcoin will reportedly make up roughly half of the ETP?ôs overall assets. XRP, the now second-biggest cryptocurrency, will make up 25.4 percent of the assets, followed by Ethereum with 16.7, Bitcoin Cash at 5.2 percent and Litecoin with 3 percent.In spite of many hopeful product launches across the crypto sector attempting to hasten mainstream adoption, regulation issues remain a serious and consistent barrier to progress. Hany Rashwan, co-founder and chief executive of Amun AG, has not overlooked this potential sticking point and maintains that the product will comply with the existing strict policies that apply to all other ETPs.Amun?ôs official website states that SIX Swiss Exchange is Europe?ôs fourth-largest exchange and has a market capitalization of $1.6 trillion.The listing of the multi-crypto based exchange is not Europe?ôs first experiment with crypto ETPs. Swedish company XBT Provider has been running the lucrative CoinShares exchange-traded product since 2015. This listing is the latest crypto development in Sweden, a state well known for its open-minded approach to innovation in the fintech sector, as well as a country predicted to become the first ?úcashless economy.?ùCoinshares has two Bitcoin trackers: XBT Bitcoin Tracker One (COINXBT) and XBT Bitcoin Tracker Euro (COINXBE). As previously reported by Cointelegraph, the two trackers trade in both euros and Swedish krona.The product ascribes 200 shares as equal to the price of one Bitcoin for trading in Swedish krona and 20 shares to one Bitcoin for the euro version. The product is accessible to investors from across Europe and has attracted over $1 billion since its 2015 listing on Nasdaq Stockholm, leading developers to launch additional versions in neighboring Denmark, Latvia, Finland and Estonia.Coinshares caught the eye of billionaire crypto investor Mark Cuban early on. Speaking at the Vanity Fair New Establishment Summit in Los Angeles, Cuban commented on the investing experience and the ascription of asset value:?úIt is interesting because there are a lot of assets which their value is just based on supply and demand. [With] most stocks, there is no intrinsic value, because you have no true ownership rights and no voting rights. You just have the ability to buy and sell those stocks. Bitcoin is the same thing. Its value is based on supply-demand. I have bought some through an ETN based on a Swedish exchange.?ùAccording to Bloomberg, COINXBE has total assets of 96.5 million euros and COINXBT has total assets of 986.3 million Swedish krona.Perhaps the most established exchange-trading method in the crypto world is that of exchange-traded funds (ETF).An ETF tracks a commodity, bonds, a stock index or one or several assets. Single-asset ETFs are now commonplace and can be used to trade a variety of assets, such as gold. As ETFs are already a major tool for passive investment in mainstream finance, many players in the crypto community hope that ETFs will pave the way toward widespread adoption. ¬†Part of the allure of ETFs that track a basket of assets is that, by their very nature, they are less prone to the risk of fluctuations that other investment instruments are vulnerable to. Because the value of the investment is spread across multiple assets, losses from underperforming assets are counterbalanced by those that more rapidly accrue value. As a result of this, ETFs enjoy popularity among low-risk investors.A Bitcoin ETF tracks Bitcoin as the underlying asset. This results in the investor only holding the security of the Bitcoin without actually owning the coins themselves. So far, Bitcoin ETF applications to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have not been successful. Billionaire twins and major crypto players Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss have had two high-profile applications denied by the SEC so far, the most recent being rejected in July. The rejection was accompanied by a 92-page report on the application that disagreed with the the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust?ôs claim that Bitcoin markets are ?úinherently resistant to manipulation.??In the report, the SEC honed in on this point in particular:?úThe arguments submitted in support of this claim are incomplete and inconsistent, and are unsupported or contradicted by data.?ùIn spite of the repeated setbacks for the Winklevoss twins??ill-fated applications, the seemingly hardline approach of the SEC has not prevented further applications from being made throughout the year.Earlier this year, investment management firm VanEck and the blockchain technology company SolidX, applied for a physically-backed Bitcoin ETF to be listed on the Chicago Board Options Exchange?ôs BZX Equities Exchange. The proposal would see each share in the ETF valued at around $200,000, in an attempt to lure in institutional investors.This tactic could prove to pay off for the two companies, considering Morgan Stanley?ôs October report that documented Bitcoin?ôs new potential for mainstream institutional investment. Furthermore, the fact that the ETF is backed by derivatives means that the firms in question will actually hold BTC as opposed to their corresponding value, a factor which may well be important in influencing the way the regulatory decision will fall for the application.As the SEC decided to postpone their decision in August, the two companies have yet to receive an official reply. Given that, as of Aug. 22, a total of nine Bitcoin ETF applications from three separate applicants have been rejected outright, the drawn out nature of the SEC?ôs decision making, along with the huge potential for crossing over into the financial mainstream that it brings, the outcome is eagerly awaited by the crypto community. The SEC did, however, publish a memorandum from a meeting about the proposal in October.The memorandum outlines the past relationship between the two companies and the regulator, taking into account their most recent, ongoing project and the failed SolidX bid for an ETF to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in March 2017. Also mentioned in the memorandum is the SEC?ôs reasoning behind the nine previously rejected applications. Two of the applications were made by ProShares, a further five were submitted by Direxion and two by GraniteShares. The SEC took umbrage at the notion that the Bitcoin futures market had ?úsignificant??demand and voiced concern at the possibility of ?úfraudulent and manipulative acts and practices????...] the Exchange has offered no record evidence to demonstrate that Bitcoin futures markets are ?òmarkets of significant size.??That failure is critical because [...] the Exchange has failed to establish that other means to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices will be sufficient, and therefore surveillance-sharing with a regulated market of significant size related to Bitcoin is necessary.?ùThe memorandum also documents how VanEck, SolidX and the representatives of the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), vehemently disagreed with the regulators on this issue, adding that their choice of the word ?úsignificant??was deliberately imprecise and enabled them to manipulate agreements between the involved parties:?úAs issuers, we are concerned the SEC staff have created a moving target in their use of the word ?òsignificant.??The Staff have never provided guidance as to what ?òsignificant??means, enabling them to move the goal post indefinitely.?ùIn spite of the tough stance the SEC has taken against the previous applications, Commissioner Hester M. Peirce announced that the regulator would once again review them in the future. In a publication that broke from the official standing of the SEC regarding Bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general, Commissioner Peirce claimed that the regulator had overstepped its ?úlimited role??in focusing on the market itself as opposed to the derivative in question:?úThe Commission erroneously reads [?? the [Securities Exchange] Act, which requires [?? that the rules of a national securities exchange be ?òdesigned to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices?¶‚Ä?[It] focuses its decision not on the ETP shares to be listed [?? but on the underlying Bitcoin spot market [?? [instead of] the ability of BZX [?? to surveil trading of and to deter manipulation in the ETP shares listed and traded on BZX.?ùOn Oct. 4, the SEC announced that, ?úby Nov. 5, 2018, any party or other person may file a statement in support of, or in opposition to, the action made pursuant to the delegated authority.?ùThe latest proposal from SolidX, VanEck and the CBOE is reported to remain under review by the regulator until February 2019.SolidX, VanEck and the CBOE are not the only ones who predict a more open-minded approach to Bitcoin ETFs. CNBC crypto analyst Brian Kelly believes that Chicago Mercantile Exchange statistics indicate a growing trend toward the derivatives marketplace and a rapidly evolving futures market. Kelly said that this is likely to improve the environment for SEC Bitcoin ETF approvals as early as next year:?úHere?ôs CME Futures open interest of large holders. [As of] April, you?ôre starting to see a big increase [?? about an 85 percent growth rate. If you extrapolate that out, by February 2019, you?ôre going to have a very robust market here.?ùNot all crypto players, however, share the same bullish approach. Tech entrepreneur, Andreas Antonopoulous, said that, although he expects the SEC to approve Bitcoin ETFs, he does not expect them to benefit the crypto industry in the long term:""I?ôm going to burst your bubble. I know a lot of people really want to see an ETF happen because 'to the moon, and lambos,' but I think it is a terrible idea. I still think it is going to happen, I just think it is a terrible idea. I?ôm actually against ETFs. I think a Bitcoin ETF is going to be damaging to the ecosystem.""On Nov. 20, the U.K.?ôs financial regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) announced in a speech that it is considering a ban on cryptocurrency derivatives. The regulator stated that this latest announcement was part of its intention to create its ?úmost comprehensive??response to the industry.Speaking at the ?úRegulation of Cryptocurrencies??event in London, the FCA executive director of strategy and competition, Christopher Woolard, emphasized that the organization was looking into outlawing derivatives. The ban would also likely include options, futures and transferable securities. Woolard elaborated on how the FCA is concerned about consumer welfare, as well as other issues across the market:?úWe?ôre concerned that retail consumers are being sold complex, volatile and often leveraged derivatives products based on exchange tokens with underlying market integrity issues.?ùFrom the mixed bag of comments from crypto players, what appears to be gaining traction is the notion that crypto exchange-traded products are likely to make their entrance into the sector regardless of whether they will actually enrich the cryptocurrency sphere or not. In spite of the progress being made to implement these investment instruments in both Sweden and Switzerland, the real litmus test will be the regulatory decision from the SEC.Commissioner Peirce?ôs harsh insider critique of the regulatory body?ôs past behavior ??along with the announcement that the past nine rejections will be re-examined ??could signal that fortunes are finally set to change for crypto exchange-traded products in the United States.As the U.K. works through its latest regulatory quandary, other players maintain that there is a market appetite for Bitcoin ETFs and it is only a matter of time before they are made available.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The analysis was performed by researchers Jiahua Xu and Benjamin Livshits at Imperial College London.","A pump and dump scheme is a form of securities fraud that has also become common in the cryptocurrency space. The organizers of the scheme choose a coin, boost its price and then ?údump??sell their overvalued currency, which further leads to the price falls and losses among the investors.While cryptocurrency markets are currently in a rut, with some coins reaching new lows in the month of November, daily trade volume is currently $14.2 billion, according to CoinMarketCap. The pump and dump volume cited in the study only accounts for 0.049 percent of total 24-hour trade volume.In the course of their research, the analysts reportedly focused on a pump and dump scam with a coin called BVB, that happened on Nov. 14, 2018. They collected details by following announcements on several Telegram channels, including Official McAfee Pump Signals, and recorded the price changes and trading volumes of the selected coin.McAfee Pump Signals reportedly revealed BVB, which had been dormant for over a year by that time, with little trading activity and a value of about 35 satoshi ($0.00132202). 1 satoshi is equal to one hundred millionth of Bitcoin (BTC).The first buy order was placed and completed within one second after the first announcement, according to Xu and Livshits.

The analysis revealed that those who joined the activity more than 18 seconds after its beginning could hardly make any profit.Additionally, Xu and Livshits investigated 236 other pump and dump scams that were performed between July 21 and Nov. 18, concluding that ?úmany of them were preceded by unusual buying activity in the target currency.??The researchers stated:?úThe study reveals that pump and dump organizers can easily use their insider information to take extra gain at the sacrifice of fellow pumpers.?ùThe researchers suggests that it is possible to spot target currencies before they are revealed by looking for unexpected trades in shadowy coins. Xu and Livshits appealed to the historical data from known pump and dump schemes to train a machine learning algorithm to trace telltale signs that a scam will soon occur.In August, the Wall Street Journal claimed in a study that cryptocurrency price manipulation was largely conducted by organized ?útrading groups??using services such as Telegram.

Let?ôs see if central banks in the U.S. and Europe can unwind this thing successfully and then see what people want to own.?ùAnalyzing the recent market tumble, Smith suggested that the crypto space still lacks the capital to ?úabsorb??abrupt sell-offs ??such as the one recently sparked by the contentious Bitcoin Cash (BCH) hard fork last week (a conflict Smith called ?újuvenile??.

Mandel has made it possible for businesses to pay taxes using Bitcoin.",29-Nov-18,"In what is being hailed as a first in America, Ohio?ôs State Treasurer Josh Mandel has made it possible for businesses to pay taxes using Bitcoin.","In the coming weeks, business owners in the state will be able to register and settle their tax liabilities online, with payments to be processes by cryptocurrency payment service provider BitPay.Businesses will be able to pay 23 different taxes using BTC through an online portal that has been set up by the state treasury office. As it stands, individuals will not be able to use the service to pay private taxes.The Ohio Treasurer has made it clear that it will not actually hold any Bitcoin. The cryptocurrency will be immediately converted to U.S. Dollars after payments have been made to BitPay. Businesses of any size will be able to make use of the payment service.The Ohio Treasurer has stated that the move is one to provide more options for state businesses and residents to interact with the state government.Mandel has been somewhat of a pioneer in leveraging emerging technologies into state systems and offerings. In 2014, he launched OhioCheckbook.com, which put all of the Ohio state government spending information online and accessible to the public.The move saw the state rated number one for government transparency, according to research from the U.S. Public Interest Research Group.This latest move is in the hopes of making the state a leader in blockchain technology development and adoption, as Mandel told Cointelegraph in an interview this week. Firstly, the state wants to offer taxpayers more options when paying taxes:?úSecondly, to project to the rest of the country and the world that the state of Ohio is a leader in blockchain technology. I believe if we?ôre going to grow our technology economy here in Ohio, we have to first be a leader in technology.?ùMandel added that he had been a crypto enthusiast for a few years and that this is just part of a process of inspiring wider adoption of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology around the country:?úHere in the United States, states are the laboratories for democracy, and I think this is a perfect illustration of this concept ??where this idea is beginning at a state level in Ohio, but the ultimate goal is to inspire the federal government to follow suit.?ùMandel?ôs term as Ohio Treasurer is set to end in January 2019, but he remains confident that the move will continue to operate once he leaves his post.It has been reported that Mandel has discussed this with his elected successor, Republican Representative Robert Sprague, and Mandel confirmed to Cointelegraph that they?ôd discussed the matter:?úI?ôve spoken with him about it, he and I are friends and allies, and I am confident that it will continue.?ùHaving launched just this week, phase one only allows businesses in Ohio to be able to pay taxes using cryptocurrency. But as Mandel explains, this is just the first step of some ambitious plans to accept different cryptocurrencies and offer the service to individual taxpayers.?úIn the next phase of Ohiocrypto.com, we hope to expand the initiative to allow individuals to pay their taxes in cryptocurrency and expand beyond Bitcoin to include other cryptocurrencies.?ùGiven the infancy of the project, Mandel was reluctant to speculate on a given timeframe for the role out of further improvements.?úAs with any initiative that is brand new and has never been done in America, it?ôs important that we take it slow and be prudent and thoughtful. We?ôre going to take the process slowly, and develop and expand it on what we believe to be a prudent timeline.?ùMandel also explained that the decision to convert Bitcoin straight to fiat currency was taken after extensive research by his team.?úWhen you?ôre dealing with taxpayers??money, the variables that are most important are safety and security of the tax money. Every decision we make in the Ohio Treasury office is driven by this.?ùBitPay CEO Stephen Paire told Cointelegraph that the initiative is an important one for blockchain-based and cryptocurrency-focused businesses that could make effective use of the payment option:?úOne of the things we do is talk to all the different companies in the blockchain and cryptocurrency industry and find out who their vendors are. We then talk to them and get them signed up with BitPay, and that enables companies in our industry to be able to pay their bills with the technology they?ôre building the infrastructure for. Obviously, all these companies have to pay taxes, so it just makes a lot of sense for all those companies to have the ability to pay their taxes with cryptocurrency.?ùOhio is the first state in America to actually launch this new method of payment, but it is not the first to have tried.Other U.S. states have tried to pass bills that would allow taxes to be paid using cryptocurrency. However, these bills have been stopped in their tracks by state lawmakers.In May 2018, Arizona?ôs House of Representatives passed a bill that would enable citizens to pay taxes using cryptocurrency. Despite that fact, the bill has yet to come into effect due to amendments in the fine print.The revision called for a study into the possibility of these alternative payment forms, but it has not been made clear when this will be carried out.Similarly, Georgia looked to pass a bill in February that would allow cryptocurrencies to be used as a payment option for state taxes and licenses. However, the bill ?údied in committee,??according to a progress update on Legiscan. Illinois is also in the process of considering a similar bill.Despite these failures, other U.S. states have passed various bills that have helped the adoption cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology which bodes well for the future of adoption.Wyoming was able to pass a number of bills that saw cryptocurrencies classified as a new asset class in the state in March 2018.The move does have some interesting implications for businesses that will look to take advantage of the new payment method.A number of countries around the world have enforced taxes on cryptocurrency gains and this will be something to consider for those entities that will pay their taxes using Bitcoin.As international tax attorney Selva Ozelli pointed out to Cointelegraph, businesses will have to grapple with additional processes when holding and using cryptocurrencies:?úBusinesses will need to keep track of the basis, holding period, price of cryptocurrencies; they will need to learn how to hedge the price swings between USD and cryptocurrencies; they will need to comply with FinCEN money laundering and additional laws. They will have increased record keeping requirements and more sophisticated treasury functions ??just like multinational companies. On the other hand, these enhanced compliance requirements will encourage blockchain companies to design systems to simplify such functions for businesses going forward and fuel growth in blockchain technology-related jobs.?ùDr. Niklas Schmidt, a partner at the law firm Wolf Theiss, also made a similar observation, especially for businesses that have held onto their Bitcoin for some time:?úPayment of taxes in cryptocurrency creates an interesting problem: If a taxpayer has purchased, say, Bitcoin some time ago and has an unrealized gain, in most jurisdictions, discharging a liability with such an appreciated asset will lead to a taxation of the gain. In other words, payment of your taxes in Bitcoin may again trigger tax.?ùAnother factor to consider is that businesses in the state will still be liable to pay federal tax, which can only be done with fiat currency, according to Schmidt.This tax payment option is not entirely new, but considering the impact it may have in Ohio and America, it could potentially spread to more countries.While these moves may have failed in other American states, Ozelli believes that the success of such initiatives in other countries proves that there is an interest in this option being available.?úIn the U.S., other states around the country also considered accepting cryptocurrencies for taxes, but those initiatives in Arizona, Georgia and Illinois never got past state legislatures. The Swiss municipality of Chiasso allowed residents to pay their taxes in Bitcoin starting in January of 2018, while Seminole County, Florida, became the very first county in the U.S. to announce accepting Bitcoin to pay their taxes in May of 2018.?ùSchmidt also told Cointelegraph that Zug, a municipality in Switzerland, also accepts tax payments in Bitcoin. With more than a few places around the world actively offering this payment option, it does seem to bode well for this becoming more commonplace.Cryptocurrency investment advisor Anthony Pompliano made an astute observation in his daily newsletter, citing milestones like this as an important use-case example for cryptocurrency going forward:?úHistorically, Bitcoin detractors have said the digital asset couldn?ôt be a currency because you can?ôt pay your taxes with it. That is obviously no longer true now. This is another data point that supports the legitimization of the world?ôs most popular decentralized digital currency.?ùGovernmental agencies and financial institutions are slowly seeing the value in incorporating cryptocurrencies into certain processes. Every step in this direction is a positive one, especially when the focus is on the current state of the markets.Mandel hopes that his work with the Treasury will play a part in influencing other states to follow in their footsteps and eventually take hold at a national level:?úI hope what we?ôre doing in Ohio will inspire states around the country to allow their taxpayers to pay in cryptocurrency and ultimately inspire the federal government to pay federal taxes with crypto as well.??

Both the DoJ and CFTC have reportedly declined to comment, and neither has either formally accused any party or entity of wrongdoing.Neither Bitfinex?ôs general counsel, nor legal representatives for the exchange and Tether, have reportedly responded to Bloomberg?ôs requests for comment either by press time.The DoJ?ôs allegedly intensified probe into activity on Bitfinex adds to prior investigations into possible misconduct; both Bitfinex and Tether received subpoenas from U.S. regulators for undisclosed reasons back in December 2017, which Bloomberg relates to insistent doubt over Tether?ôs claims that USDT is backed one-to-one by the U.S. dollar.Vocal Tether critics have gone so far as to accuse the firm of covering up an alleged fiat reserve deficit in complicity with Bitfinex; suspicion was further fanned by Tether?ôs controversial decision to dissolve its relationship with a third-party auditor this January. Tether has since released an unofficial audit in June to prove that its tokens are backed by the correct amount of fiat holdings.Further controversies were stoked this June when an academic paper co-authored by University of Texas professor John M. Griffin argued that ?úpurchases with Tether are timed following market downturns and result in sizable increases in Bitcoin prices.??Two of Bloomberg?ôs sources have today claimed that Griffin briefed the CTFC on his findings earlier this year, although the academic has reportedly declined to comment in response to Bloomberg?ôs inquiries.This fall, Bitfinex has been plagued by rumors of insolvency and alleged banking difficulties, which it has officially denied. In late October, Tether redeemed and destroyed 500 million USDT from its treasury wallet; the action provoked yet further controversy given Tether?ôs recent ??if brief ??loss of its U.S. dollar peg. Such large-scale redemption prompted some to accuse the firm of manipulating the market by redeeming at low cost and liquidating after market rebound.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the Bank of Thailand issued its circular), 113 Bitcoins were traded for ...",23-Nov-18,"Since May 2014, Thailand has been under the control of a military dictatorship. And given that the coup, led by the Royal Thai Armed Forces, brought internet censorship, a¬†suspension of the Kingdom's constitution, and a¬†disbanding of its senate, casual observers would be forgiven for supposing that the Southeast Asian country is now possibly one of the least favorable places on Earth for the use and development of technological innovations.","However, while Thailand's earlier history with crypto might confirm this assumption, more recent months have provided a case study in how blockchain and cryptocurrencies can find a place even within rigidly authoritarian political structures. Slowly but surely, the military junta revealed and acted on plans to legalize ICOs, to authorize crypto-exchanges, and also to enforce regulation that legitimizes crypto. And this all comes at a time when the same junta has¬†re-permitted political activity in anticipation of next year's general election, raising the very strong possibility that crypto will play an even bigger role in Thailand's economic and political life as the nation continues forging its path towards modest liberalization.Much can happen in crypto in a single year, and nothing proves this more than the progress Thailand has made in fostering a crypto-friendly environment. Having previously taken an ambivalent stance towards cryptocurrencies, the central Bank of Thailand issued an order to the country's banks in February, requesting that they stop directly dealing with any company that trades or works with cryptocurrencies, pending the passage of future legislation.Less than two weeks later, Bangkok Bank became the first financial institution in the country to act on this decree, halting its transactions with the Thai Digital Asset Exchange (TDAX). TDAX founder Poramin Insom explained:""The bank called and asked whether there was an operating licence for proof, but I answered that this business was not under legal jurisdiction [hence the absence of an operating licence], so the bank said it would terminate the company's bank account, as this business had no licence.""A few days later, the state-owned Krungthai Bank followed suit and also¬†announced that it was ceasing all business with TDAX, after its chairman ??Somchai Sujjapongse, a permanent secretary at the Finance Ministry ??gave an official order to do so. Together with Bangkok Bank's previous action, this struck an ominous note for the cryptocurrency industry in Thailand, particularly when TDAX decided to cease new ICO registrations, for fear that Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) were responsible, more than anything else, for turning the Thai government against crypto.Considering critical remarks made at the time by Sujjapongse about Bitcoin, few would have imagined a particularly rosy future for cryptocurrencies in Thailand. He¬†said in February:""Allowing Bitcoin transactions to be made without warnings and direction from regulators is not acceptable.?ùNonetheless, his allusion to regulators revealed that Thailand's emerging approach to crypto wouldn't involve banning it outright, but rather ensuring that it operated within a context in which consumers and the wider Thai economy were protected.Indeed, a month later, the government¬†published its much-anticipated first draft of regulations for digital assets. These were cautious, yet in outlining a capital gains tax of 15 percent and requiring all crypto-platforms to register with the relevant authorities, they were clearly aimed at making crypto an integral part of Thailand's economic landscape. This was confirmed in May, when the regulatory framework¬†came into force, requiring token traders and sellers to register with the Thai Security Exchange Commission (SEC) within 90 days, or face fines of at least 500,000 baht (around $15,700) and/or maximum jail terms of two years.While the Thai military government unsurprisingly had an anti-democratic, hardline¬†reputation around this point, there was arguably never any question of cryptocurrency being banned or severely curtailed in the country. That's because crypto was already far too popular for the government to do anything meaningful to restrict it.For example, in the week ending February 17 (during which the Bank of Thailand issued its circular), 113 Bitcoins¬†were traded for Thai baht (THB) on the Local Bitcoins exchange. By comparison, only¬†20 Bitcoins were traded for Turkish lira on the same exchange in the same week, while only 12 were traded for Argentine pesos. According to the International Monetary Fund, both of these countries have economies bigger than Thailand's, sitting respectively at 17th and 21st on the global table, compared to 26th for Thailand.In conjunction with the fact that both Turkey and Argentina have been suffering from¬†serious inflation this year, such figures offer a vivid indication of how big crypto is in Thailand, and how foolish the Thai government would have been to attempt a full crackdown. And considering that the Thai economy actually¬†contracted following the 2014 coup, it's clear that crypto is far too big an opportunity for any Thai government to neglect. This is especially true when fears surrounding economic growth persisted to the beginning of this year, as Thailand¬†failed to match GDP increases enjoyed by neighboring Vietnam and the Philippines.It's therefore no surprise that, more recently, the government has increasingly strived to nurture Thai crypto. Not only did the SEC¬†implement regulations in July that permit ICOs (so long as they're based in Thailand), but it confirmed a month later that it had already¬†authorized seven companies ??including TDAX ??to operate as exchanges and/or carry out crypto-related business in the country.At the same time, it also¬†announced that it was receiving a large number of applications for licensing from other Thai startups and firms, which were interested in either holding an ICO or opening a digital asset exchange. This came as the Bank of Thailand¬†permitted the country's banks to open subsidiaries for the express purpose of handling and working with cryptocurrencies, something which theoretically ?úring-fences??them and the Thai economy from any risk of instability.In parallel with the development of this new, semi-permissive legislative environment, the Thai government has itself also been looking towards cryptocurrencies and blockchain.Back in June, the Bank of Thailand's governor, Veerathai Santiprabhob,¬†revealed that the central bank was looking into the possibility of issuing its own cryptocurrency for the purposes of enabling faster interbank settlements.""Like other central banks, our goal is not to immediately bring CBDC [central bank-issued digital currency] into use, but rather to explore its potential and implications for back office operations.?ùIn August the bank¬†announced that it would indeed be building its own CBDC, using¬†R3's Corda platform.Encouragingly for crypto, Santiprabhob said in a November interview with Thai media that he expects that the country and its financial institutions will need three to five years to make the ?úswitch??to digital currencies. Half a decade might seem like a long time for some impatient investors, but given that such a statement hints at the Bank of Thailand?ôs long-term intentions to adopt crypto at scale, it provides positive confirmation that cryptocurrencies will have a permanent home in the Asian country.The central bank hasn't been the only part of the Thai establishment to explore crypto and blockchain in recent months. In late July, the Thai Bond Market Association¬†said that it would begin using a private blockchain to register bonds by the end of the year, and that it's looking into introducing its own utility coins to support the system. While in October, the Ministry of Commerce¬†detailed plans to trial decentralized ledger technology in the areas of copyright management, agriculture, and trade finance.There is, then, a big opening up in Thailand towards crypto and the economic opportunities it provides. However, even if there is now a process of partial liberalization underway in the military-controlled nation, the crypto industry should be under no illusion that the Thai government is still anything but highly cautious when it comes to cryptocurrencies.Back in October, the Thai SEC¬†issued warnings about nine unregistered tokens and ICOs. This was ostensibly to highlight the financial risk they might carry for the public, although the warning also offered some indication of just how jealously it and the Thai government watch for anything that might undermine their power and oversight.Similarly, the Deputy Prime Minister, Wissanu Krea-ngam, gave a speech at the beginning of November in which he¬†said the government wants to do more to regulate cryptocurrencies and to prevent them from being misused by terrorists, criminals, and money launderers.Given that Thailand has the 13th highest number of terrorist incidents in the world (according to the Global Terrorism Database), this is a reasonable aim, but there's a worry that it may invite mission creep, as the government increasingly curbs legitimate crypto-related activity in a bid to curb illegitimate activity.Thailand began using the death penalty again this year after a nine-year moratorium, while the new king ??Bhumibol Adulyadej ??has taken¬†steps to¬†consolidate his¬†power in the wake of his father's death. Such features of national life arguably create an unfavorable climate for crypto, which is often sold as a means of distributing and weakening central power, rather than as a way of bolstering it. However, plans to hold a general election next year ??as well as the Thai government's slow-and-steady approach to legislation ??do at least suggest that there is an increasingly assured place for the crypto community to do business in Thailand, so long as they stick obediently to the rules.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bitcoin payments reportedly slumped from $427 million last December ...",30-Nov-18,A recent study by blockchain-oriented research firm Clovr found that cryptocurrency coverage in the mainstream media spikes when the market drops off. The analysis tracked the correlation between coverage on crypto values over the past five years and the sentiments of published materials.,"Source: ClovrIn the course of its research, Clovr surveyed 48 mainstream U.S.-based and international media outlets for pieces covering cryptocurrency from Jan.1, 2013, to July 31, 2018. All articles were analyzed using sentiment analysis tool Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner (VADER) and the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library in Python. The analysis included the full text of 7,527 online news articles.In the last weeks of 2017 crypto coverage in the media spiked following a sharp drop-off in cryptocurrency, which was attributed to a confluence of factors such as strong performance of altcoins, and Bitcoin (BTC) holders selling off their coins to pay for holiday purchases. The same trend was reported in May and June 2018, when a further drop in crypto values was followed by a temporary increase in articles. The study further reads:?úAs recently as 2016, positive articles far exceeded negative ones, both in terms of volume and intensity. As coverage surged in mid-2017, however, articles expressing negative sentiment grew more common. This trend was fueled in part to grim prognostications by the likes of Warren Buffett and Mark Cuban, who guessed that ?òa bubble??was underway.?ùSource: ClovrAs for news sites that covered digital currency most often, Clovr notes Forbes and Business Insider, where ?úa combined 1,335 articles from these two outlets alone were more positive than the overall median sentiment of the sampled articles, while only 413 of their articles fell on the negative side.?ùCNBC released almost 1,000 crypto-related articles during the analysed period, with 52.9 percent being positive and 47 percent being negative. At the same time, American far-right news website Breitbart News along with left leaning American news organization Raw Story cumulatively published 91 negative articles and just one positive piece. The average sentiment of Reuters, USA Today, and Gizmodo articles reportedly decreased substantially over time.As previously reported, BTC use for commercial payments reduced significantly this year, according to a study by Chainalysis. Although Chainalysis recognizes a growing stability of BTC, the value of Bitcoin payments reportedly slumped from $427 million last December to $96 million in September 2018.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

trading, while its parent company OKCoin had been trading Bitcoin ( ...",25-Nov-18,"Last week, OKEx exchange faced negative publicity and accusations of marketing manipulation after adjusting Bitcoin Cash (BCH) futures settlements during the notorious hard fork.","On November 20, the exchange responded to those allegations, essentially defending its decision and promising to provide evidence if the case goes to court. Curiously, it is at least the third time this year that OKEx has shown strange price volatility on their exchange.OKEx was founded in 2017 as an international arm of the no longer operating Chinese exchange OKCoin. According to data from CoinMarketCap, it is currently the second largest player by volume, handling more than $1 billion worth of crypto trades per day. OKEx is based in Belize and has an operating hub in Hong Kong. Moreover, in April 2018, the company expanded its presence to Malta, citing their ?úconfidence??in the local government?ôs approach to cryptocurrencies.The exchange has been focusing on futures trading, which is basically an agreement to buy or sell an asset on a specific future date at a specific price, hence representing a risk management tool for investors.On Nov. 3, 2017, OKEx launched its Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Ethereum (ETH) futures trading, while its parent company OKCoin had been trading Bitcoin (BTC) futures since 2014. In December 2017, crypto futures received wider recognition after mainstream exchanges Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) and Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) introduced BTC futures trading to the wider market.On Nov. 14, amidst the Bitcoin Cash hard fork that resulted in two different blockchains, BCH ABC and BCH SV, being born, OKEx abruptly forced the early settlement of its Bitcoin Cash contracts ?úto avoid potential losses to [their] customers caused by the short-term volatility and possible market manipulation attempts.??Thus, the BCH future contracts were settled early against the last traded price at early Nov 14, shortly after the announcement.The move was criticized by a number of investors, who claimed that they had suffered major losses as a result of OKEx??decision. Namely, Amber AI, a Hong Kong-based crypto firm co-founded by former Morgan Stanley trader Tiantian Kullander, as per LinkedIn, published a Medium article on the matter, arguing that OKex had changed the rules of the settlement index by discontinuing to reference Bitfinex prices before the early settlement. The update details were published on November 12, just two days prior to the event:?úBy changing the settlement date and delivery rule against the open interest in the market, [OKex] invalidated their previous announcement. This meant that for each short position carried in the contract, OKEx implicitly imposed a fixed loss on the notional amount, delivering the contract 20% higher vs fair value.?úThis is no different than the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) announcing that the S&P 500 E-Mini Futures will settle against the Shanghai Composite Index in the midst of trading.?ùAdditionally, Amber AI accused OKex of intentionally malfunctioning the order submission system on Nov. 15, during BCH ?úmost volatile trading session in 9 months.??According to the crypto company, traders were unable to submit their orders due to a ?úLimit Order Bug,??although OKEx continued to operate at large:?úRecorded level-2 data throughout this period shows the order matching engine as functioning. The exchange continued to host traffic and operate but with all order submissions blocked, except buy-orders below the best bid, and sell-orders above the best offer.?ùAmber AI continued with even more allegations by claiming that OKex ?úsponsored??a company called ?òHoneycomb Finance??to publish a Reddit post allegedly supporting the exchange?ôs point of view. Finally, Amber AI claimed that OKEx ultimately imposed a BSV liability for its BCH borrowers despite allegedly writing that ?úusers who have outstanding borrow of BCH, [...] will not need to repay BSV??before silently updating its announcement.Ultimately, traders lost ??24 million??due to the incident, the post argues, continuing:?úThe course of events surrounding the BCH hard fork are indicative of market manipulation, fraud and deceit.?ùThere were others who have voiced their discontent in regards to how OKex handled the BCH hard fork. Thus, Qiao Changhe, the founder of Beijing-based Consensus Technologies, told Bloomberg that his fund lost $700,000 because its hedging position on OKEx ?úwas abruptly closed at a level that didn?ôt reflect prevailing market prices???úOKEx is losing its credibility [...] The futures contract became something nonsense, not something we could use to hedge.?ùChanghe also added that he was going to reduce his $5 million fund?ôs use of OKEx because of that incident. Bloomberg mentions four other alleged traders who chose to stay anonymous, but also confirmed that they were going to limit or end their relationships with the exchange. One of them reportedly filed a complaint with Hong Kong?ôs Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), whilst the agency?ôs spokesman declined to comment after being approached by Bloomberg.OKEx has issued a number of comments regarding the incident. First, the exchange explained its reasoning in a blog post published shortly after the hard fork, on Nov. 15. In it, OKEx said that they brought the delivery time earlier because of strong volatility and unclarity of ?úthe final outcome.?ù‚ÄúAn early announcement may make room for market manipulation and cause loss to our users,??the exchange added when explaining the urgency of the move.Further, on Nov. 19, Andy Cheung, head of operations at OKEx, echoed that response in a comment for Bloomberg:?úAfter considering various scenarios, we decided that an early settlement was the most fair and rational decision to maintain an orderly market.?ùOn Nov. 20, OKEx directly addressed Amber AI?ôs article via Medium. First, the exchange claimed that they ?údo not have an institutional client profile named Amber AI, while Amber AI claim themselves as a Hong Kong-based company,??adding that OKEx ??does not] serve any customer in Hong Kong, in respect of the local laws and regulations???úThe OKEx account that Amber AI claimed managing is an individual account, which is not a Hong Kong resident or entity on the report of the KYC information,??the exchange then disclosed. ?úAmber AI made a profit from the individual account on OKEx they claimed to have managed during the early delivery.?ùMore importantly, OKEx denied any manipulation, noting that Amber AI?ôs statements ?úhave caused serious damages to OKEx' reputation??and that ?úmajority of [OKex?? users supports our decision of early delivery of BCH futures contracts.??The exchange also stated that it is ready to address the allegations in court:?úWe will disclose the evidence required to the court to prove that OKEx is not involved in the alleged trading when deemed necessary. We reaffirm that we will NEVER [sic] trade against our customers and manipulate the market.?ùThere are at least two other similar incidents involving OKEx that happened in 2018. First, there was an abnormal pricing drop on March 30 when the exchange posted quarterly futures market that were significantly lower BTC/USD readings comparing to the rest of the market. In a video that was circulating on Twitter at the time, an OKEx trader who allegedly lost 11 mln yuan ($1.75 mln) in the debacle was threatening CEO with committing suicide by drinking poison at the exchange?ôs office in Hong Kong.OKEx blamed the issue on users closing huge numbers of contracts ?úregardless of costs.?ù‚ÄúOKEx has the right to warn against all unethical behavior such as malicious manipulation of prices, malicious influence on trading systems, restrictions on trading, shutting down of accounts, etc.,??the company?ôs statement shared with clients read. OKEx also confirmed that a rollback had been completed, and that normal trading operations would resume shortly.Furthermore, in August, OKEx featured in another situation involving strange market fluctuation after forced liquidation of a large misfired Bitcoin futures trade worth $416 million was initiated by an unknown trader.Due to the ?úsheer size of the order????a hefty 4,168,515 contracts, according to the exchange ??OKEx said it took preemptive action, explaining that their risk team asked the client to ?úpartially close the positions to reduce the overall market risks??several times.?úHowever, the client refused to cooperate, which lead to our decision of freezing the client?ôs account to prevent further positions increasing ¬†Shortly after this...unfortunately, the BTC price tumbled, causing the liquidation of the account.?ùThe exchange then allegedly injected 2,500 BTC (around $18.5 million at the time) into an insurance fund to help mitigate the losses incurred by the force-liquidated trade.Crucially, it was revealed that aside from this insurance cover, the platform did not provide the funds that traders use to leverage their futures contracts. Instead, it relied on the so-called ?úsocialized claw-back??policy for such cases, meaning that the losses from the unfilled order would need to be covered by counterpart traders. In that particular instance, some traders were set to lose 18 percent of their profits.OKEx??official statement outlined measures the exchange was undertaking to ?úprevent similar cases??from occurring again and to enhance risk management and thwart possible manipulation.In a comment for Cointelegraph at the time, OKEx head of operations, Andy Cheung, claimed that this had been a ?úvaluable lesson??for him and OKEx.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As of now, LinkedIn?ôs search system displays 13,816 records related to blockchain and 2,479 records related to cryptocurrency.These estimates are supported by recent data published by Glassdoor?ôs recruitment portal. As of August 2018, United States companies had posted 1,775 vacancies related to blockchain technology, which is three times more compared to the previous year.As noted in the Glassdoor report, 79 percent of the vacancies are concentrated in the 15 largest American cities, and the most saturated demand regions show that New York and San Francisco account for 24 percent and 21 percent of the total number of crypto-industry job openings. The current total number of blockchain and cryptocurrency vacancies worldwide has grown to around 3,000 and 900 correspondingly.Software developers are the highest demanded occupation, with 19 percent of vacancies published by employers seeking employees falling into this category. In addition to programmers and technical specialists in the crypto industry, there is a shortage of product managers, risk analysts and marketing specialists.Traders and investment analysts are not among the most sought-after professionals in the crypto industry. But there are more and more vacancies for specialists in new disciplines that have appeared in the wake of blockchain technology?ôs popularity ???úDecentralized Finance,???úDecentralized Internet,??and ?úSecurity Hardware.?ùHowever, if taking into consideration the last three months, a fuller picture looks partially different. According to the extended analytics shared by job-search platform Indeed with Cointelegraph, from October 2017 to October 2018, job-seeker interest for roles related to Bitcoin, blockchain and cryptocurrency declined by 3 percent, while employer interest for roles related to the same terms only rose (25.49 percent), which was different than the interest levels from the year before by both parties.If looking at data from 2016 to 2017, job-seeker interest for roles related to Bitcoin, blockchain and cryptocurrency rose by 481.61 percent, while employer interest for roles related to the same terms rose by 325 percent.The following graph shows both the growth of job-seeker interest in jobs with these keywords and the growth of job postings for jobs with these keywords for that time period.Today, IBM, ConsenSys and Oracle have the greatest need for qualified personnel. Each of them has more than 200 corresponding vacancies, as Glassdoor reports. They became strong competitors of the industry leaders like crypto exchanges, among which Coinbase and Kraken have the greatest need for qualified personnel. The list of major employers for blockchain professionals has also been joined by larger consulting firms Accenture and KPMG. At the same time, the lack of vacancies related to blockchain from such giants as Facebook, Google and Apple could be noted.The need for crypto industry experts isn?ôt a uniquely American phenomenon. In August, Cointelegraph reported a 50 percent increase in the number of vacancies associated with blockchain and cryptocurrency in Australia, India, Singapore and Malaysia compared with 2017. At the same time, developers who are proficient in the Python programming language are among the most desirable candidates.The lack of qualified personnel means higher salaries for blockchain specialists. As estimated by Glassdoor, the average base salary for such employees is $84,884 a year. This is 62 percent higher than the average wage in the United States ($52,461 per year). At the same time, the variation in salaries ranges from $36,046 for junior developers to $223,667 a year for qualified software engineers.Blockchain developers with three to five years of experience can earn ?úhalf-a-million-dollars??a year, according to Blockchain Developers recruitment agency. At the same time, analysts suggest that newcomers can count on a salary ?údefinitely well over $120,000.?ùCompany executives also noted the increase in salaries in the blockchain and cryptocurrency industry. According to David Schwartz, chief cryptographer at Ripple, the hiring packages have ""gotten insane"" since ?úICOs dumped a bunch of money on the industry.??In particular, a couple of Ripple developers received ??1 million signing bonus offers,??Schwartz disclosed.Notably, the current average salary of software engineer at Ripple is $125,000, as estimated by Glassdoor. Given the fact that the same job was paid $85,000 in May 2018, according to Paysa, it doesn?ôt seem the crypto market prices affect the developers salaries, at least not at Ripple.Some employers attribute the decline in the quality of products produced by developers to the increase in salaries. According to Alex Ferrara, partner at Bessemer Venture Partners, which invests in crypto funds, such an ?úovereagerness??is ?úimpacting the pace of development. A lot of these projects are way behind on their launch schedules.?ùThe current realities of the blockchain industry has been continuously battered by a declining cryptocurrency market, which is partially responsible for the tightening of staff shortages. As raising funds through ICO became more accessible than crowdfunding, qualified specialists prefer to launch their own projects and begin to assemble their development teams, as was the case with Amber Baldet. The leader of JPMorgan Chase?ôs blockchain team left the company on April 2 to start her own project. As a result of such ?úforks??inside companies, the shortage of personnel is becoming increasingly acute.The popularity of cryptocurrency as a means of remuneration is also growing, although not as quickly. On Sept. 17, HR startup Chronobank published the results of its survey of 445 crypto enthusiasts from around the world, including the U.S., Australia and Russia. The respondents were asked in which currency they preferred to receive wages.Two-thirds (66 percent) of them stated that they were ready to be paid for work in Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. The majority (83 percent) of respondents indicated they were supportive of receiving their bonus payments in digital money. Of the individuals interviewed, 72 percent said that, when choosing their next job, they would prefer an employer who offered the possibility of paying salaries in cryptocurrency.One-fifth of the respondents indicated that they would exchange cryptocurrency, received as wages, for traditional money. Notably, half of the respondents believe that if they receive a salary in cryptocurrency, they will spend less than they do now.The results of the latest survey conducted by peer-to-peer (p2p) platform Humans.net demonstrated the high level of interest and readiness among U.S. citizens to get paid in cryptocurrencies. Eleven percent of 1,100 freelancers responded that they would like to have their salaries be paid in digital money, and 18 percent expressed their desire to receive a part of their wages in crypto.Today, wages in cryptocurrency are popular mainly inside the industry. On Aug.18 TechCrunch editor Michael Arrington tweeted that Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao told him that 90 percent of the company's employees preferred to receive a salary in the platform?ôs native token, Binance Coin (BNB).In December 2017, GMO Internet, a Tokyo-based IT giant, announced its plans to start paying salaries in cryptocurrency. The company intended to pay up to 100,000 yen ($884) of over 4,000 employees monthly salary in Bitcoin. Bitcoin.com also offers its employees the opportunity to get paid in Bitcoin Cash, given the information from job openings located on its website.However, cryptocurrency wage payment goes beyond the industry. In August, semi-professional football club ""Gibraltar United"" announced plans to pay its players a salary with a cryptocurrency called Quantocoin. Club owner Pablo Dan believes that the use of cryptocurrency provides greater transparency and, most importantly, simplifies financial relations with foreign footballers playing for the club. Experts believe that the salaries in cryptocurrency will help international companies attract remote foreign specialists.?úSeveral U.S.-based companies are paying their international workers in Bitcoin, as it can save both the company and the employee money,??Bloomberg Law analysts suggest. According to the statistics published on the company?ôs website, nearly 200 companies use Bitwage, a service allowing employees and freelancers to receive payments in cryptocurrency. As estimated by Bloomberg Law, about 65 percent of Bitwage clients are U.S. companies, and 95 percent are using it for paying wages to international workers.The current statistics, located on the Bitwage?ôs website, shows that over $31 million has been paid to employees by the companies through this service. Among the clients mentioned are Google, Facebook, Uber and Airbnb.For some people, cryptocurrency payments become more than just a new way to carry out the transactions. Workers in such regions like Latin America, which might not have a matured banking system or stable currency, are given the ability to be paid in cryptocurrencies. For example, developers in Venezuela got more business opportunities and revenues with the advent of Bitcoin. However, receiving wages in cryptocurrency may involve tax liability.The main obstacle to the spread of cryptocurrency salaries remains the lack of clearly defined legislation, including tax rules. Today, the regulatory approaches of different countries and their views on the taxation of digital money vary greatly.In the European Union, there are no special rules for regulating activities related to digital money, and the taxation of crypto transactions is regulated by the national legislation of each country. As a result, in France, digital currencies are subject to capital gains taxes, with fees of 14-45 percent. Germany doesn?ôt charge any taxes as long as cryptocurrency is used as a means of payment. Bitcoin has no established legal status in the U.K,, but is commonly treated as a foreign currency for most purposes, including value-added and goods-and-service taxes.Asian countries offer a different approach to taxation of crypto-related activity. In Singapore, if digital currencies are part of the taxpayer's investment portfolio, then the profits from selling them are not taxed, since they are considered capital gains. Notably, Bitcoin is recognized not as money but as a service, and therefore a tax on goods and services (local analogue to VAT) is applied to it. In China, cryptocurrency transactions are subject to income tax and capital gains tax, and revenues are subject to taxation. Japanese individuals are charged from 15 to 55 percent for any activity related to Bitcoin.In Australia, cryptocurrency transactions are subject to income tax. In Canada, they are subject to income and capital gains tax, with up to 50 percent of the revenue charged. In the U.S., cryptocurrency owners pay taxes on digital money as they would on property.As blockchain technology and cryptocurrency give birth to new jobs, business models reliant on third-party involvement may become increasingly outdated. The bottom line is that smart contracts ??decentralized, digitized commercial agreements ??control the fulfillment of obligations by all parties and manage all essential financial flows. As a result, the third-party services of various kinds of intermediaries may no longer be required.Meanwhile, mediation services constitute a large segment of the modern economy. After all, in traditional contracts used by banks, brokers, authorities, realtors and others, it is the intermediary that describes the terms of the transaction, draws up the document template, monitors the execution of an agreement, and appropriates a significant part of the payment.Smart contracts automatically coordinate and ensure the interests of all parties, almost instantly and free-of-charge. Moreover, the inability to change information in the blockchain provides the highest level of security to all participants in the transaction, eliminating the possibility of data manipulation and deception. Basically, one smart contract can replace a room full of corporate lawyers, realtors, recruiters, risk managers and other professionals whose work essentially boils down to the formal assessment of documents.In addition to regulating labor relations inside the company, blockchain technology can become a magic pill for the freelancing industry. During the past couple of years, the scale of remote work around the world has increased significantly, and the sector is expected to continue to expand. Former U.S. Secretary of Labor Robert Reich calculated that in a couple of years, 40 percent of the U.S. workforce will be freelancers. However, this could lead to a number of issues since freelancers are not considered to be full-time employees, which means that they remain outside the scope of health insurance, pensions and other social benefits.Moreover, they are forced to use the services of aggregator sites, which primarily focus on the interests of the customer, and not the freelancers themselves. In addition, such platforms like Upwork charge up to 20 percent for a bill, and payments for the work performed are often delayed.Some projects use the advantages of blockchain technology to solve the problems that currently plague the freelance economy. Some provide freelancers with service where blockchain is leveraged to ensure paid vacation and sick pay when needed. Other solutions offer a blockchain-based system for resolving disputes between customers and freelancers. Some platforms are deploying blockchain-powered Human Resource Bank to allow p2p matching of potential employers with contractors on the basis of verifiability of all user data, and excluding the possibility of falsification.The use of blockchain technologies in social networks and internet sites for freelancers demonstrates the high demand of the industry for new solutions using advanced technologies and cryptocurrencies. The exclusion of intermediaries, direct communication, reputation systems is what the blockchain brings to the labor industry.The pace of development and the integration of blockchain and cryptocurrency in everyday life will likely depend on the position and attitude of national governments. Countries with a friendly position on cryptocurrency are already leaders in the use of blockchain technology.Florida residents pay for property taxes, driver's licenses, ID cards and car numbers in cryptocurrencies ??Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash ??using the BitPay payment system. The corresponding decree has been approved by the State Department of Taxes.Meanwhile, in 2017, China banned cryptocurrency trading, ICOs and cryptocurrency exchanges, and the result was a tenfold decrease in the circulation of cryptocurrencies. According to the country's central bank, the yuan's share in the Bitcoin market fell from 90 percent to 1 percent, and 88 crypto exchanges and 85 blockchain startups that had been operating in China since autumn 2017 left the country. In such conditions, the numbers of those who want to receive a salary in Bitcoin may also gradually drop.Another factor, which may impact the adoption of cryptocurrency in the labor market, is the price of digital currency. As of now, most cryptocurrencies are volatile, and that dramatically cools the enthusiasm of workers regarding the payments of wages in digital currency.As the sector continues to develop, mature and adhere to government-mandated regulations, the number of workers choosing to receive their wages in Bitcoin, Ether and other cryptocurrencies may become more and more common. Raj Mukherjee, senior vice president of products at Indeed, told Cointelegraph:?úWhile over the last few years, Indeed saw a steady rise in job-seeker interest for roles related to cryptocurrency, our data shows that job searches for these roles really picked up around the time when the cost of Bitcoin was at its highest. Since then, job-seeker interest has gone down, but still remains strong.?ùOn the other hand, the demand for specialists capable of solving specific tasks will grow. Stephane Kasriel, CEO of Upwork said:?úIn just a few years, more than 30 percent of the workforce?ôs essential skills will be new. We?ôre seeing that shift take place on Upwork, where new and emerging skills like blockchain surface on a monthly basis.""Large corporations like IBM and Microsoft have been willing to invest for the long term in blockchain by expanding hiring over the last year. The trend of mid-2018 will likely continue moving to smaller companies, as experts predict. Though the overall number of applications posted by job-seekers has declined by 3 percent since last year, the continuous fall in cryptocurrencies??prices hasn?ôt affected the interest that companies seeking blockchain specialists have demonstrated.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

dodgy CEOs. During the past 10 years since Bitcoin's inception in ...",04-Dec-18,"Like many different industries, Hollywood?ôs involvement with cryptocurrencies and Initial Coin Offerings (ICO) has become a reality and a number of celebrities have looked to capitalize on the surge in interest and potential money to be made.","As Cointelegraph has previously explored, some celebrities have gone on to achieve success in their crypto-related ventures, while others have been embroiled in the ensuing mess of failed and fraudulent projects.Two major names in the entertainment industry fell victim to the fallout associated with a fraudulent ICO of crypto financial services startup Centra Tech.In 2018, the three co-founders of the project were indicted and charged with securities and wire fraud by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Centra Tech had raised $32 million during its ICO.Centra Card was advertised as a debit card reportedly backed by Visa and Mastercard, which allowed users to convert crypto into fiat currencies. Investigations revealed no actual partnership existed.Before any of this came to light, the founders of the project managed to get the backing of none other than boxing superstar Floyd ?òMoney??Mayweather. The boxer had posted a photo on Twitter with a Centra debit card in hand in September last year.Mayweather wasn?ôt the only high-profile celebrity to be tainted by association to the fraudulent project.American music producer DJ Khaled had also endorsed the project on social media, touting the Centra debit card on Instagram. Nevertheless, the post has since been deleted from his social media profiles.Last week, both celebrities had to face the music for their involvement with Centra Tech. The SEC formally charged both Mayweather and Khaled for unlawfully advertising the fraudulent ICO.Mayweather copped a heavy judgement from the regulator for not disclosing promotional payments from three ICO issuers, including $100,000 from Centra Tech. Khaled also failed to disclose a $50,000 payment from Centra Tech.Both celebrities refrained from admitting or denying the charges against them and agreed to pay penalties and restrictions to the SEC. Mayweather will pay $300,000 in disgorgement, a $300,000 penalty, as well as $14,775 in prejudgement interest.Khaled is set to pay $50,000 in disgorgement, $100,000 as a penalty, and $2,725 in prejudgement interest.The ramifications of their involvement goes further than financial penalties. Mayweather has agreed to collaborate with the ongoing investigation into Centra Tech and has been barred from promoting securities for three years. Khaled cannot promote any securities for two years.During the past 10 years since Bitcoin?ôs inception in Satoshi Nakamoto?ôs white paper, we?ôve seen more than a few spin-offs and hard forks riding on the name of the preeminent cryptocurrency.In January 2018, a project named Bitcoiin2Gen was launched and was widely labelled as a pyramid scheme and MLM company. Its dodgy project prompted a warning ¬†to consumers from the Tennessee Department of Commerce & Insurance (TDCI) Securities Division.What made things even more perplexing was that American actor Steven Seagal was revealed as the brand ambassador for the project?ôs ICO. The project claimed to be a peer-to-peer (p2p) payment system in the mould of Bitcoin, running on the Ethereum blockchain.Seagal?ôs involvement with the ICO didn?ôt go unnoticed by the SEC, which issued a statement directed at celebrities that warned of possible legal ramifications should they not be abiding by securities regulations:""Celebrities and others are using social media networks to encourage the public to purchase stocks and other investments. These endorsements may be unlawful if they do not disclose the nature, source, and amount of any compensation paid, directly or indirectly, by the company in exchange for the endorsement.""Just two months after its launch, the founders ??along with Seagal ??announced their departure from the project after the completion of its ICO in March.American actress, businesswoman, and socialite Paris Hilton also fell prey to a not-so-innocent ICO in 2017.Hilton had expressed her interest in the LydianCoin ICO in a series of now-deleted Tweets on Twitter. A few months laters, when the CEO of LudianCoin?ôs parent company was embroiled in serious legal trouble, Hilton publically distanced herself from the project.American rapper The Game also got involved in the world of ICOs in August 2017, posting a video on Twitter in which he promoted a blockchain-based platform focused on the marijuana industry.According to reports, the founders of the project did not register the ICO with the relevant regulators, which led to legal battles with initial investors.U.S. rapper T.I. faced a lawsuit from investors after his FLiK token seemingly failed in November. A group of 25 investors are reportedly suing the rapper and his business partner, Ryan Felton.The group had invested over $1,3 million in the token sale. It is claimed that T.I. and Felton used the money raised during the token sale to pump the price of the coin before dumping their FLiK tokens. The plaintiffs are looking for $5 million in damages from the duo.The SEC?ôs decision to charge both Mayweather and Khaled has made the consequences of unlawful promotions of ICOs clear for all to see.As the SEC enforcement division co-director, Stephanie Avakian, explained in the aftermath of the Mayweather and Khaled settlements, celebrity endorsements of ICOs can have far-reaching consequences for unassuming investors:""These cases highlight the importance of full disclosure to investors. With no disclosure about the payments, Mayweather and Khaled's ICO promotions may have appeared to be unbiased, rather than paid endorsements.""The SEC enforcement division co-director, Steven Peikin, urged investors to be wary of so-called investment advice on social media platforms:?úInvestors should be skeptical of investment advice posted to social media platforms, and should not make decisions based on celebrity endorsements. Social media influencers are often paid promoters, not investment professionals, and the securities they?ôre touting, regardless of whether they are issued using traditional certificates or on the blockchain, could be frauds.""The SEC?ôs stance has been given a significant clout by the sheer sum of money both Mayweather and Khaled have had to pay for their indiscretions. If anything, it sends a strong message to other celebrities that are being paid to tout projects.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Each offer investors a new way to back crypto, without relying on the highs and lows of cryptocurrency prices in an erratic and volatile market.But what are these alternatives ??and are they really everything they?ôre cracked up to be?In many cases, some of the new products emerging in the crypto market are iterations of services that have existed in the old-fashioned financial world for years. Bonds are a good example. These have been kicking around for more than 500 years ??and back in 1694, they were issued by the Bank of England to fund a war against France.How do they work? In essence, they are a fixed-income instrument that amounts to something of an ?úI.O.U.??Lenders give businesses the money that they need to achieve their aspirations, with borrowers usually receiving interest rate payments once per year until the full amount of the loan is due. When it comes to interest, this could fluctuate based on variable rates, or it may be fixed.Bonds have already been gaining momentum ??with the World Bank hitting the headlines back in summer 2018.¬†On August 10, the first blockchain-based bond was issued by the biggest bank in Australia - Commonwealth Bank of¬†Australia. This is not the first debt instrument to be issued through blockchain ??with¬†Spain?ôs BBVA signing a $117 million loan over the summer in a bid to benefit from the traceability and transparency of smart contracts.The hope is that crypto bonds could enable blockchain-based businesses to generate money to grow ??offering them an alternative from ICOs, which have had something of a torrid time of late. Although research in October suggested that¬†more than $20 billion had been raised through initial coin offerings since the beginning of 2017, this has been slowing of late ?ì¬†with ICO funding for August 2018 ranked the slowest for 13 months.Futures have been a hot topic of discussion in the crypto world ever since Bitcoin reached the dizzying highs of $20,000 towards the end of 2017.These conversations have rumbled through right up to today, with the volatility seen in the crypto market showing no signs of abating. In brief, futures involve two parties agreeing to buy or sell cryptocurrencies at a previously agreed-upon price on a set date. Rather than being used as a mechanism that helps to boost profitability, futures are often relied upon as a way to mitigate risk.Why is this a compelling financial instrument? Let?ôs say you believe that Bitcoin?ôs value is going to rise in the coming months. You can buy a three-month contract for one Bitcoin at the current price and receive it at contract?ôs conclusion. If the price of Bitcoin rises dramatically over those 90 days, you would be buying it at the same price, resulting in a tidy profit.Of course, this instrument can work conversely. Let?ôs imagine that you bought Bitcoin at an optimal moment, but you think that the price is about to fall precipitously. Through futures, you have the opportunity to enter into an agreement where you sell the Bitcoin at its current price in three months??time ??and if its value tumbles, you pocket the profit. It?ôs fair to describe such behavior as a bet, as no one can predict where the market is going, but if you?ôre experienced and have insight into crypto movements, futures could prove indispensable.So yes: futures can help traders shield themselves against the perils of fluctuation ??and give investors in countries where crypto is banned a chance to get involved. That said, it isn?ôt without risks. Given the dramatic highs and lows seen in crypto in recent months, you could argue that futures are tantamount to gambling. Red or black?Puns can never let you down during a heavy feature that focuses on crypto financial instruments. If you don?ôt think that futures are the future, options are an option for you. These instruments mean that you have the right to buy or sell Bitcoins at a particular price when the options mature, but you are not obligated to complete the transaction. There is often a premium for using these financial services.These dramatic shifts in the crypto market have sparked diversification by digital asset platforms ??giving investors greater choice. Bonds, futures and options are beginning to flourish in the industry. For example, Bibox, an AI-driven exchange, has just launched bonds, aiming to give new opportunities to traders.A slowdown in ICOs has meant that startups are looking for new ways to raise capital, while investors are on the lookout for new ways to protect and grow their assets. Whether derivatives gain momentum in 2019 is yet to be seen, but there?ôs no doubt that chatter surrounding financial instruments is on the increase.Disclaimer.

The NTA will be able to solicit information on customers who are suspected of tax evasion, including names, addresses, and 12-digit individual identification numbers.The sources told the Mainichi Shimbun that the ruling coalition will start elaborating the new taxation system later in 2019, aiming to introduce it by the new fiscal year in April 2020. Due to privacy concerns, the NTA will likely request data only on those users who presumably earned over 10 million yen (approximately $88,700) from crypto transactions.Under the current legislation, crypto exchanges and other businesses serving as middlemen in the crypto area may provide the data on customers voluntarily, or refuse to do so. In case the above-mentioned legislation is introduced, the intermediaries will still be able to appeal requests to turn over information.According to a recent NTA survey cited by Mainichi Shimbun, over 300 individuals declared they earned at least 100 million yen from crypto deals in 2017. The paper links it to a drastic market increase in the end of 2017, when Bitcoin (BTC) jumped to a record $20,000.Earlier in October, a Japanese taxation policy committee held a debate on simplifying the complex tax filing regime currently in place for Japanese citizens.

International Arbitration ruled a case involving cryptos. Inside the ...",26-Nov-18,"On November 2, Taiwan officially tightened anti-money laundering (AML) policies targeted at crypto exchanges, requesting exchanges to monitor and prevent any illegal transaction processed using digital assets.","According to the newly drafted Money Laundering Control Act and Terrorism Financing Prevention Act approved by the Legislative Yuan, one of the five branches of the Taiwanese government, the country?ôs Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) now has authority over crypto exchanges to ban transactions suspected of being tied to fraudulent operations.Taiwan?ôs Ministry of Justice (MoJ) released a statement following the approval of the new AML bill, emphasizing that the government is working towards meeting international AML standards by encouraging businesses to foster a ?úcompliance culture and mindset.?ùUntil this year, the government of Taiwan was skeptical towards regulating the local cryptocurrency exchange market and blockchain sector.South Korea, the third largest cryptocurrency exchange market, also refrained from implementing practical and efficient regulations to govern its local digital asset market until 2018, because it feared that investors would recognize it as a move to legitimize the cryptocurrency industry.Based on its recently passed AML bill and the stance of the country?ôs main financial watchdog towards the cryptocurrency sector, Taiwan is likely leaning towards regulating its local cryptocurrency and blockchain space to prevent fraudulent operations and criminal activities using cryptocurrencies.For decades, Taiwan has had a complicated relationship with China. The official name of Taiwan is the Republic of China (RoC) and since the RoC's loss of the mainland to the People?ôs Republic of China (PRC) governed by the Communist Party of China, the PRC has consistently claimed sovereignty over Taiwan and said that the ROC is no longer in legal existence.Although Taiwan has claimed to be the legitimate government of China, the loss of Hainan in 1950 has limited the jurisdiction of the Taiwanese government to Taiwan and its two outlying islands Quemoy and Matsu.In recent years, mostly due to the increasing support of the U.S., the tension between Taiwan and China has continued to increase. On October 22, reports revealed that Taiwan is preparing to pitch for more U.S. arms and weaponry, after the U.S. approved the purchase of $330 million of arms sales to Taiwan in September.Representatives of Taiwan, the ¬†U.S., and China had drastically contrasting viewpoints on the increasing arms sales from the U.S. to Taiwan.Lo Chih-cheng, a ruling-party lawmaker on the parliament?ôs defense committee, said that regardless of the relationship between Taiwan and China, the government of Taiwan must possess credible defense and sufficient weapons to defend the region from potential attacks:?úIn the worst case, we have only ourselves to rely on. We should not be so dependent on the U.S. in the long term. But we still need to buy weapons from the U.S. to secure our defenses while we are building our capabilities.?ùThe Institute for National Defense and Security Research, an organization funded by Taiwan?ôs defense ministry, noted that the established conflict between the U.S. and China was ?úa strategic window of opportunity for Taiwan??to build a strong defense system to protect the region.However, the government of China fiercely opposed the arms sales of the U.S. to Taiwan. The foreign ministry in Beijing said in June of last year that the $1.4 billion deal had ?úseverely damaged China?ôs security and sovereignty,??describing Taiwan as an ?úindispensable part of China?ôs territory.?ùAt the time, Michael Kovrig of International Crisis Group said, ?úif this is, in fact, intentional timing, this does represent a change of tone. The Americans would clearly be aware that this is going to irritate the Chinese. It?ôs not leaving room for the Chinese to save face,??adding that any additional arms sales to Taiwan could worsen the relationship between the U.S. and Taiwan.In a period in which the Chinese mainstream media and state-backed publications are accusing U.S. President Donald Trump of playing a high-stakes game backing Taiwan, any activity to fuel the already intensified tension among the U.S., Taiwan, and China could lead to serious international conflicts and what the Chinese government call, ?údire consequences.??The China Daily editorial reported on October 24:?úMilitary hawks in Washington have tried hard to scare Beijing and console Taipei. But they should consider the dire consequences of their country being dragged into a costly confrontation that would in the first place be both unnecessary and avoidable.??¬†One of the few common areas the government of Taiwan and China agree on is the prevention of money laundering through the utilization of electronic payment systems including cryptocurrencies.Recently, in an attempt to completely ban money laundering efforts and fraudulent activities in the global cryptocurrency sector, the government of Japan also called for the establishment of standardized AML regulations regarding cryptocurrencies, specifically concerning anonymous cryptocurrencies like Monero, Zcash, and Dash. An FSA official said on October 24:?úIt should be seriously discussed as to whether any registered cryptocurrency exchange should be allowed to use such currencies. It's nearly impossible for Japan to handle the problem alone. Even if trade is restricted to only domestic transfers or monitoring is enhanced, it's still not enough to counter money laundering. It would be best if all the group of 20 industrial and emerging nations and regions (G20) would take the same steps toward prevention.?ùOver the past several months, led by Taiwan legislator and congressman Jason Hsu, the government of Taiwan has demonstrated a more proactive and open-minded approach towards regulating the local cryptocurrency market.In an interview, Hsu explained that a parliamentary coalition had been formed in Taiwan to focus on regulating blockchain and crypto with a set of guidelines targeted at cryptocurrency exchanges. He added that Taiwan is set to cooperate with Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong, and other Asian countries to facilitate the growth of the local cryptocurrency space.Hence, rather than China?ôs direct impact on Taiwan, a collective effort by the lawmakers and Congress of Taiwan to regulate the country?ôs cryptocurrency space most likely led to the changes in the new AML bill.?úWe have set up a parliamentary coalition in Taiwan?ôs parliament for blockchain, which is a bipartisan alliance designed to help support the industry. I have also launched self-regulatory organizations for blockchain and crypto, where we are working together to come up with a set of guidelines to regulate exchanges. These guidelines will provide basic parameters as to how crypto exchanges and other taxations are defined. When we announce the guidelines in the coming weeks, it will be a regional consensus with Taiwan, Japan and Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong as well as other Asian countries.?ùTaiwan legislator and congressman Jason HsuChina officially banned cryptocurrency trading in September 2017, expressing concerns towards money laundering and capital controls. The government has limited the outflow of the Chinese yuan to overseas markets for decades, and through exchanges, investors were able to bring capital outside of the local market prior to the ban.As Cointelegraph extensively reported, the government actively banned nearly every area in the cryptocurrency sector including events, media, and over-the-counter (OTC) trading, requesting AliPay, the country?ôs most widely utilized fintech application to block any transaction that is suspected of being connected to cryptocurrency exchanges.However, on Oct.r 25, 2018 the Shenzhen Court of International Arbitration officially stated that under local regulations, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum are considered properties and as such, holding or transferring Bitcoin is not illegal in China.?úChinese court confirms Bitcoin is protected by law. Shenzhen Court of International Arbitration ruled a case involving cryptos. Inside the verdict: China law does not forbid owning and transferring Bitcoin, which should be protected by law because of its property nature and economic value.?ùThe ruling from the Shenzhen Court of International Arbitration essentially provided merchants with a green light to accept cryptocurrencies as a payment method without being in conflict with existing regulations.As of November, China?ôs oldest technology publication, Beijing Sci-Tech Report (BSTR), and several hotels and restaurants accept cryptocurrencies.Beginning January, BSTR will officially sell its yearly subscription in Bitcoin at a fixed price of 0.01 BTC. But, the publication reaffirmed that the purpose of the integration is to demonstrate the real-world potential and use case of the blockchain, and that if the price of BTC rises substantially, the publication will refund the buyers.Hence, while cryptocurrency trading remains prohibited in China, technically, owning or transferring cryptocurrencies is not illegal. As such, it can be argued that China, to a certain extent, is not wholly dismissive of crypto, given the government?ôs optimism towards blockchain technology as a core pillar of the fourth industrial revolution.The Xiongan government, tasked to build Chinese President Xi Jinping?ôs dream city, the Xiongan New Area, has made blockchain technology a key component of the project, working with Ethereum-related institutions, including ConsenSys, the largest blockchain software studio in the global sector, led by Ethereum co-creator Joseph Lubin, to develop blockchain-based tools for the government .Lubin said in July:?úAs one of our first major projects in the People?ôs Republic of China, we are excited to help define the many ?òuse cases??that could benefit from the trust infrastructure enabled by ethereum technology.?ùSingapore, Hong Kong, South Korea, and Japan, the four regions congressman Jason Hsu mentioned, have already evolved into major markets.Upbit, South Korea?ôs second largest cryptocurrency exchange and Binance, the world?ôs largest digital asset trading platform, according to the Blockchain Transparency Institute, have already established offices in Singapore and entered beta testing of their trading platforms with banking partners secured.Japan and South Korea, as two of the largest cryptocurrency markets, have demonstrated significant progress in terms of regulation and industry growth.To compete against the four markets, Taiwan would have to establish a strong selling point to attract cryptocurrency exchanges and blockchain-related businesses.Recently, the FSC of South Korea declared that banks are free to work with crypto exchanges and the Seoul Central District Court ruled a case between local cryptocurrency exchange Coinis, and major commercial bank Nonghyup, in favor of Coinis, establishing a precedent for the industry.Attorney Kim Tae-rim, who represented Coinis, said that the case is a milestone for the cryptocurrency sector as it would encourage banks to refrain from unfairly treating digital asset exchanges.?úCryptocurrency exchanges, by default, have the right to freely deposit and withdraw funds to and from major banks in South Korea, and an abrupt termination of partnership and services by the bank [in this case Nonghyup] without sufficient evidence or reasoning falls under the breach of contract.?ùSo far, Taiwan has not led sufficient initiatives to lure in some of the biggest cryptocurrency and blockchain-related businesses from other major markets. But, if Hsu and the coalition continue to drive the adoption of crypto in Taiwan, in the mid-term, companies enter the market given that stable banking services and support from the government are guaranteed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

69,https://cointelegraph.com,12-Dec-18,Stratis?ôs C# Full Node Release: a Versatile Blockchain Development Kit,https://cointelegraph.com/press-releases/stratiss-c-full-node-release-a-versatile-blockchain-development-kit,"Currently, it supports both the Bitcoin and Stratis networks and with minor 
modifications can be made to support other cryptocurrencies as well.",12-Dec-18,"On Wednesday 12th December,¬†Stratis¬†unveiled their C# Full Node. This long-awaited release is the culmination of two years??worth of work from the Stratis team and represents the core service of their platform.","A computer running software which supports a cryptocurrency is called a node. A¬†full¬†node is a node which runs software to fully verify transactions and blocks.Up until now, Stratis??full node software has been a placeholder for the C# Full Node, which has been in continuous development since their ICO in 2016. The legacy full nodes, referred to as the StratisX nodes, allowed Stratis both to function as a currency and also to grow to become a mature network with a high level of decentralisation and security.With the advent of the C# Full Node, however, the Stratis Platform can now go live. The C# Full Node is the foundation on top of which the rest of the platform sits. It is built from the ground up in the C# coding language, an industry standard language and part of the broader .NET framework, Microsoft?ôs own software ecosystem.The other services of the Stratis Platform all run on top of the C# Full Node software, including Sidechains and Stratis??C# Smart Contracts - Turing complete smart contracts which execute .NET code on-chain, a first in the cryptocurrency space and only made possible by Stratis??C# Full Node. You can learn more about these upcoming releases in Stratis??stacked roadmap.The Stratis C# Full Node is more than just a node. It is a powerful and versatile development kit, offering developers huge flexibility in the development of blockchains and blockchain technologies. It supports multiple consensus protocols (PoW, PoS and PoA) and can connect to multiple chains. Currently, it supports both the Bitcoin and Stratis networks and with minor modifications can be made to support other cryptocurrencies as well.Stratis??C# Full Node is modular, allowing users to pick and choose blockchain components as they see fit for their applications. It has a pluggable architecture, supporting the creation of sidechains, the deployment of smart contracts, remote procedure calls, a web API and the creation of Distributed Ledger Technology solutions, amongst other features.Stratis??C# Full Node is fully open source. It is available on Microsoft?ôs Azure Marketplace and can be deployed directly to Azure. This is indicative of Stratis?ôs relationship with the Microsoft tech stack: they recently became a member of the Microsoft Partnership Network and an Independent Software Vendor.Stratis??positioning within the .NET ecosystem comes with some distinct advantages, such as a familiar environment for developers and the ease with which the nodes can be deployed. Being able to host a C# Full Node on Azure will allow users to establish networks with very low network latency, in turn allowing for smaller block times and a larger maximum throughput. Such networks could be sidechains of Stratis, permissioned DLT solutions or new, independent blockchains.Out of the box, the C# Full Node uses a protocol which is very similar to the Bitcoin protocol. This means that developers who are confident in working with Bitcoin will find the Stratis C# Full Node a familiar software to work with. This, paired with its highly customisable architecture, allows developers to create nodes tailored to specific applications but still with a proven and familiar protocol.The C# Full Nodes come with various security improvements over the legacy StratisX nodes, new features for general users and numerous optimizations, including being able to download the Stratis blockchain significantly than the legacy StratisX nodes.The Full Node GUI, Stratis Core, is a user-friendly wallet which allows users to send, receive and stake their coins. The wallet is Hierarchical Deterministic, meaning users can generate multiple keys from one seed. This affords users greater security and easier recovery of funds.Besides these basic functions, Stratis Core also offers cold staking and a UI for sidechains. Cold staking will be activated once 95% of network staking is performed through the C# Full Node client, allowing users to participate in block production by staking with coins that are held in an offline wallet. This will significantly reduce risks associated with staking from a hot wallet.With the release of the Stratis C# Full Node, the Stratis Platform goes live. Stratis have published¬†extensive documentation which accompanies this release¬†and encourage any users to¬†reach out directly to them¬†for support and feedback.

Blockchain News ¬∑ Business News ¬∑ Technology News ¬∑ Policy & ...",24-Nov-18,"In common law systems, it is precedent that informs judicial approaches to new and previously unaddressed matters. The precedent that will likely shape the body of U.S. case law on fraudulent initial coin offerings (ICOs) is currently being forged in a federal court in the New York borough of Brooklyn, where a 39-year old entrepreneur, Maksim Zaslavskiy, has pleaded guilty to committing securities fraud.","The development that will most likely result in a landmark decision ??the jury will gather in April 2019 to decide on a sentence ??is yet another twist of a now 14 month-long effort, involving both the U.S. Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Previously, the process has already yielded a fateful ruling by a federal judge who in September established that securities law is applicable to ICO-related cases.The case that is poised to become so consequential for the whole ICO space deals with two ventures that neither issued a token nor developed any blockchain-powered infrastructure: REcoin and Diamond Reserve Coin both only existed on paper. Yet it also makes perfect sense that the authorities first went after the most brazen instances of ICO fraud, the ones that hurt rookie retail investors the worst and inflicted the most reputational damage on the industry.When the SEC first filed a complaint against Zaslavskiy in a federal court in September 2017, it was estimated that REcoin and Diamond Reserve Coin ICOs resulted in around 1,000 investors losing some $300,000. Having fallen for Zaslavskiy?ôs aggressive marketing campaign, these people were led to believe that they either invested in a digital asset that was backed by real estate located in developed countries (REcoin), or purchased a tokenized membership in an elite club for wealthy business people, with physical diamonds in the company?ôs custody underlying the value of tokens.In fact, though, they were buying ?úworthless certificates,??as U.S. district attorney, Richard Donague, put it, on Nov. 15, 2018, Zaslavskiy admitted in his guilty plea: ?úWe had not yet purchased any real estate.??He now faces up to 5 years in prison, pending the decision of a jury panel. The regulator is also filing a civil lawsuit against Zaslavskiy.The Ukrainian city of Odessa, overlooking a scenic coastline of the Black Sea, is known for its vibrant spirit and unique culture. Throughout both the Imperial and Soviet periods of its history, the city has been home to a large Jewish community. As the final years of the USSR saw the liberalization of immigration policies, many Odessan Jews chose to leave for either Israel or the West. Born in Odessa, Maksim Zaslavskiy was 12 when his family relocated to the U.S. While Maksim was destined to make ICO history, his brother, Dmitry, chose a banking career and later became an executive director for Morgan Stanley.Zaslavskiy?ôs social media pages, as well as websites of many organizations he ran at various points of time, were either deleted or became unavailable in the wake of the high-profile investigation into his activities. The main source of information about his pre-trial life is now the four-hour interview to the SEC representative that he gave in September 2017, of which the Fast Company magazine managed to obtain a transcript.In 2003, Zaslavskiy received his degree in finance from Baruch College, followed by a LLM from Yeshiva University?ôs Cardozo School of Law three years later. He worked as an IT consultant for several banks before starting his own international business, whose nature is difficult to infer from the interview. Zaslavskiy also claimed to have been involved in real estate business since the age of 18, yet Fast Company?ôs investigation failed to verify his employment with the firms he claimed to have worked for.According to the interview, the 2008 crisis became a major blow for Zaslavskiy?ôs business, further entrenching him in his resentment of the U.S. financial system. He turned to charity work, founding a philanthropic organization called Live Love Laugh. However, it is impossible to say whether the ambitious statements on its website (which is now down) were ever backed by any real actions, since the entity appears to never have been properly registered.Zaslavskiy has also written at least three books (under the name Avi Meir Zaslavsky) that can be still found on Amazon. These are how-to guidebooks on the ins and outs of real estate business. Another one, which appeared around the time his two ICOs were in full swing in August 2017, sets out to explain the reader that ?úwhat you perceive and use as money is designed in such a way that the wealth created by the economy truly benefits only large banks and multinational corporations.?ùApparently, the book was meant to lend credibility to Zaslavskiy?ôs claim for intellectual leadership in the crypto space, as its press release presents him as ?úone of the world?ôs leading currency decentralization proponents.??The publicity campaign around the book provides a glimpse into Zaslavskiy?ôs approach to marketing himself and his ventures: bold, extravagant, overblown. Unsurprisingly, this style carried over to the way his two ICOs were presented to potential investors.For someone disenchanted with both the traditional financial system and traditional means of making money, the ICO rush of 2017 presented innumerable opportunities. The beauty of the ICO model was that it opened up the world of venture capital, previously reserved exclusively for professional investors, to anyone with a few spare dollars and some interest in the uncharted space of blockchain applications. The flipside of it is that some of the newcomers were unable to tell legitimate projects from outright scams replete with red flags.Megalomaniac language and exaggerated promises are usually telltale signs of something not being right with the venture that?ôs taking off. Zaslavskiy?ôs projects had both. REcoin, announced in June 2017, presented its founder as a ?úReal Estate guru??and proclaimed that the 101REcoin Trust held properties ?úin developed and stable economies like the USA, Canada, Japan, Great Britain, and Switzerland??without providing any evidence in support. Also, an ?úinternational team of attorneys and programmers??was allegedly there to ?úwork tirelessly??on increasing token holders??fortunes. As the court proceedings later revealed, no such team ever existed.In August, after facing the first signs of SEC interest to REcoin, the ?úEntrepreneur, Philanthropist, and Author Max Zaslavsky??began his marketing campaign for an allegedly diamond-backed digital asset, the Diamond Reserve Club token. The release (beginning with ?úIf the Holy Scriptures have taught us anything at all?¶‚Ä? touted a brand new Initial Membership Offering model, which was supposed to tokenize investors??participation in a large ecosystem of interconnected businesses. It also suggested that the tokens could be inherited by the investors??grandchildren.One would think that the theatrical language and gargantuan assurances of the two ICOs??public-facing documents would only make any reasonable person scoff. Yet from July through September Zaslavskiy and his accomplices managed to amass around $300,000 before the SEC took the matter to court.On Sep. 29, 2017, the SEC brought a civil complaint to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York against Zaslavskiy and his two companies for violating U.S. securities laws. Recoin and DRC responded on their websites with a joint statement that argued that it was due to ?úlack of legal clarity as to when an ICO or a digital asset is a security,??suggesting that their operations were not within the SEC?ôs purview.However, the Feds seemed to disagree. On Nov. 1, Zaslavskiy was apprehended by FBI agents and criminally charged with a conspiracy to commit securities fraud. In early December, he pleaded not guilty and secured a $250,000 bail backed by his family?ôs Brooklyn house. In February, Zaslavskiy?ôs defense filed a motion to dismiss the indictment on the grounds of inappropriate application of securities law to cryptocurrencies. Yet both the DoJ and SEC insisted that REcoin and DRC tokens passed the Howey test ??a legal standard that determines whether a contract is a security.In September, U.S. district judge Raymond Dearie concluded that for the purposes of the case, the tokens could, indeed, be treated as securities, potentially setting a precedent that could shape the future of ICO regulation. The judge was also unequivocal in characterizing the nature of Zaslavskiy?ôs enterprises:?úStripped of the 21st century jargon, including the Defendant?ôs own characterization of the offered investment opportunities, the challenged indictment charges a straightforward scam, replete with the common characteristics of many financial frauds.??

Upon launch, exchanges and node operators will be required to update to the new core codebase.The team says one of the most exciting developments from the upgrade is its Dynamic Fees system, which enables ARK users to outline the maximum fee they are prepared to pay in order for their transaction to be completed.ARK wants to create a marketplace for transaction fees ??offering flexibility to people who are prepared to wait a little longer for funds to clear in order to keep their costs down. The protocol-level change could also help increase levels of competition among delegates, who are responsible for including transactions in their blocks.

Mechanisms are also in place to prevent users from transferring more funds than they intended.Once the hard fork has been completed to Core V2, ARK says its platform will be able to handle three times more transactions per second (TPS). The number of transactions that can be placed in a single block is increasing from 50 to 150 ??and this will increase TPS capabilities to 18.75. While this is by no means a limit, executives say ?úwe don?ôt foresee the need to increase this further??for now.The new core is also going to help the platform build upon its goal of becoming the ?úWordPress of blockchains.??Improvements have been made to simplify the process of developing plugins that leverage the power of blockchain ??and according to ARK, it only takes users a few lines of code to remove or add plugins to the system.Other notable features included in this upgrade include multisignature transactions, a brand-new API and webhook support, better verification measures, and one of the first blockchain plugin implementations that gives ARK the ability to be modular and fully customizable.As previously reported by Cointelegraph, ARK says it aims to create accessible tools which enhance understanding about blockchain technology and its potential. A SmartBridge feature also allows its blockchain to interact with all ARK-based blockchains, as well as other mainstream networks such as Ethereum and Bitcoin.ARK has stressed that Core V2 is not backwards compatible with its previous version but says the upgrade is not a contentious one, unlike with¬†Bitcoin Cash. Though a soft fork was initially planned, its development team concluded this ?úwould take too much time and effort????distracting them from driving the platform forward.In a blog post, the team wrote: ?úAll are in agreement that the upgrades are necessary and beneficial to the network. ARK will continue on as one network, with substantial upgrades, and a positive foundation for future development.?ùARK says its open-source technology is free of charge and open to everyone ??underpinned by a friendly community of experts who can offer advice and guidance.Looking ahead, the platform is preparing to launch a second version of its white paper, along with new editions of its desktop and mobile wallets. An e-commerce plugin called ARK Pay is also being released soon, and this will make it simple for websites to accept ARK as a payment method.As the end of 2018 nears, further updates on the items outstanding in its roadmap are going to be presented to the community.Disclaimer.

Unboxed",https://cointelegraph.com/news/first-blockchain-smartphones-appear-on-the-market-sirin-labs-finney-unboxed,"... the direct exchange of selected cryptocurrencies (Ethereum, Bitcoin and 
Sirin Labs Token) without the need to use a centralized exchange.",02-Dec-18,"After months of expectation and one of the top-five biggest ICOs of 2017, on Nov. 29 Sirin Labs has launched Finney, the 'world's first' blockchain smartphone. Yet, even with the endorsement of football legend Lionel Messi and a $157.8 million token sale behind it, the $999 device has stepped into uncharted territory, where its built-in cold storage wallet and DApp ecosystem will have to contend with the dominance of Apple and Samsung ??as well as the Exodus 1, a rival blockchain smartphone from HTC.","Most of Finney's key features had already been announced prior to Thursday's launch: The smartphone comes equipped with an embedded cold storage wallet that's physically separate from the main hardware; its Sirin OS is a ""Google-certified"" mod of the Android operating system; it boasts AI-driven, cyber-threat detection; and it enables the direct exchange of selected cryptocurrencies (Ethereum, Bitcoin and Sirin Labs Token) without the need to use a centralized exchange.But at its launch event in Barcelona, Sirin Labs provided more concrete details as to its wider aims and expectations for Finney, revealing that the smartphone is just the beginning of its plans to bring blockchain technology to mobile devices.Most of all, the Israeli company used the launch event to emphasize how Finney is a smartphone that makes blockchain technology more accessible to a mainstream audience and that provides diehard crypto enthusiasts with a more practical way of securely managing their coins.?úThis is the most important computer of our generation ??smartphone.??The Finney phone is a one-stop shop"," declared Sirin Labs' co-founder and co-CEO Moshe Hogeg during his presentation. """"Before the Finney", you needed a ledger, you needed a computer, you needed wallet software and then you needed to go to an exchange," and then you could convert. The Finney does all of this in one phone.""""By having a cold storage wallet", a Token Conversion Service and crypto-exchange apps on a single device," Hogeg affirmed that Finney will take """"a huge step forward in bridging the gap between the blockchain economy and the consumer market", making the world of crypto more accessible to an audience that doesn't necessarily have the time or inclination to sign up for Kraken or Coinbase on their PCs and then buy a Ledger or Trezor wallet.Image source: Sirin LabsAnother, more predictable facet of Sirin Labs' plan to attract a mass market is that Finney comes with all the specs and functionality you'd expect from a 2018 smartphone. The phone has a 12MP (megapixel) rear camera, an 8MP selfie camera, as well as a 6-inch touchscreen, 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage memory. This puts it at least in the same league as this year's iPhone XS, which also has a 12MP rear camera (albeit a dual one), but actually a smaller, 5.5-inch screen, 4GB of RAM and a 7MP selfie camera.The fact that it boasts performance superiority in several departments here would help make the phone desirable to someone who may have been thinking about buying a separate hardware wallet and an iPhone XS (or Samsung Galaxy S9) ??and just as importantly, so too will the ease with which its main features (the hardware wallet and DApp store) can be used.The process of transactions is quick and painless, involving the physical opening of the wallet (which is slid upward from the top of the phone) and a few taps of its touchscreen, as well as a few taps on the smartphone?ôs display (e.g. to choose which kind of transaction you want to make). One nice feature is that Finney enables the user to easily compare the addresses and transaction amounts shown in both the wallet's screen and the phone's, something which ensures that they won't end up sending coins to the wrong recipient as a result of a hack or bug.Yet, Sirin Labs is aiming with Finney to make cryptocurrency more accessible and popular in a number of other ways. First of all, the company famously recruited Lionel Messi to be Finney's brand ambassador back in 2017, hoping that 'the GOAT' and ?òa hacker on the camp?? according to Hogel, would be the best person to make Finney ??and crypto ??much more visible to a mass market.Contento de haber estado con los amigos de @sirinlabs hoy en Barcelona para seguir impulsando una mejor seguridad en los dispositivos m√≥viles gracias a la tecnolog√≠a Sirin OS. #SirinOS #SRN Happy to have been with my friends from @sirinlabs today in Barcelona to continue promoting improved security for mobile devices thanks to Sirin OS technology. #SirinOS #SRNA post shared by  Leo Messi (@leomessi) on Nov 29," 2018 at 11:49am PST""""I think security and privacy is the number one priority right now. For everybody it's important", because we have all our content, all our lives on mobile phones [?? Privacy is very important now more than ever, because right now there are lots of hackers," and people can steal your identity or your money.""""Lionel MessiAdded to Messi's enviable reputation", Sirin Labs revealed that Finney will make crypto more accessible through the smartphone's dCENTER. Not only does this feature provide users with a DApp store for decentralized, crypto-related applications, but it actually rewards them with SRN Tokens for engaging and spending time with the apps it offers. Moreover, Hogeg claimed that owners can claw back around $300 of the phone's asking price by engaging with all of the apps available at launch.The company is referring to this program as 'Earn and Learn,' and in conjunction with the outreach-focused concept stores due to open in December in London and Tokyo, it shows how Sirin Labs hopes that the smartphone will serve as a champion for the wider cryptocurrency industry," and not just Sirin Labs itself.""""Our entire concept is to bridge the gap"," Erin Brazilay ??Sirin Labs' Chief Commercial Officer ??explained to Cointelegraph. """"And as such", we're going to open concept stores in London and Tokyo and other places. Our stores will be kind of an academy for the blockchain community; all the staff will be trained at the highest level," so people in the community can come and ask questions [about blockchain and cryptocurrency]. So that even someone who is a first-comer can come and get the full understanding of how the technology works. And there is nothing like that in the market.""""The company is also releasing Finney with its own blockchain-focused operating system", Sirin OS," which it ambitiously aims to take beyond its own hardware. """"We have decided to develop the Finney"," the first blockchain phone that runs Sirin OS. But this is only the beginning of the execution of our vision. Our vision is that every Android-based device would run Sirin OS. We are hoping for other OEMs [original equipment manufacturers] to adopt the Sirin OS and join us in the blockchain revolution.""""In other words", Sirin Labs doesn't simply want to make blockchain phones, but to produce the platform for cryptocurrency and blockchain applications, becoming a kind of ?òcrypto Google.??If it can get a crypto-oriented operating system on, say, a Samsung, Huawei or HTC phone, then it will go a long way in making crypto mainstream," and this is why Erin Brazilay affirmed that Sirin OS is """"at least"""" as important as Finney to Sirin Labs' longer term strategy: """"We need to put a lot of pressure on the OEM side", to convince them to adopt Sirin OS as the standard," de-facto technology to enable their phones to be blockchain-enabled.""""As can be imagined", Sirin Labs is hopeful for Finney's future. Aiming to ship 100,000 units of the smartphone within one year, it's already accepting orders for the device on its website ??and in January, the phone will also be available to buy via the Amazon Launchpad platform.However, other voices and industry figures are skeptical that the smartphone will have much of an impact outside of cryptocurrency circles. Speaking to Cointelegraph, Gartner's senior principal analyst, Tuong H. Nguyen," believes that it will appeal mostly to """"tech savvy"""" individuals and """"early adopters.""""""""I would question the ability for this device to achieve mass market success. The broader question I think you?ôre asking is 'what is the appeal/must-have functionality that this 'blockchain phone' is providing?' The storage wallet applies to a niche segment of the mass market. Not only would it be appealing to the few people who own crypto", but it goes a niche deeper by trying to convince these few people they need a phone that specifically does this (put another way, why wouldn?ôt I buy a phone from a larger," more well-known OEM with tons of features ??more than I would likely use ??minus the crypto features?)""""Not only does Sirin Labs have to contend with the possibility that Finney might appeal only to a """"niche segment"""" of the market", but it also has more than one competitor in the blockchain-phone sector.For one, HTC is due to release the Exodus 1 in December ??and like Finney, it's a high-end smartphone that features a cold storage wallet, although it is currently $39 cheaper than Sirin Labs' offering. And on top of HTC, there's one other manufacturer of a blockchain phone, Pundi X.Back in October," the India-based blockchain payment provider announced its very own """"XPhone", a smartphone due in Q2 2019 that can transmit phone calls, texts and mobile data using blockchain nodes, thereby avoiding the need to use centralized mobile networks. And as the company's vice president, Peko Wan, claimed to Cointelegraph," this ability to provide basic phone services via decentralization makes it more of a blockchain phone than Finney.""""What makes the XPhone unique is that it actually uses a blockchain-based protocol for communicating data", making calls, sending messages and more. That means users communicate with each other securely and independently of a central carrier via nodes. We will stand by the uniqueness of the way in which we have reinvented blockchain for use as a transmission protocol for telephony and data of all kinds. In every sense," we have built a true blockchain phone.""""Regardless of such opinions on whether it is a 'true' blockchain phone or not", what is clear is that, with Finney, Sirin Labs has taken an important step for the cryptocurrency industry. Within the space of a year, it has delivered on a massive ICO by releasing a high-performance and secure product that will provide actual utility and value to its users. This is something not many blockchain projects can claim to have done, and while it's hard to predict just where the future will take Finney and Sirin OS," it can only be a good thing that the crypto industry has finally begun producing gadgets all people can use."""

According to Global News, Alberta?ôs government supports the initiative. The officials expect that the Calgary Dollar could support small businesses and nonprofits by keeping funds within the city.Calgary Dollars work through a smartphone app that lists shops and restaurants that participate in the program.

The document summarized the 13th gathering of G-20 nations that took place on Nov. 30 and Dec. 1 in Buenos Aires, Argentina.The declaration addressed crypto regulation, albeit briefly: Cryptocurrencies are mentioned just once there, in the broader context of an ?úopen and resilient financial system??that ?úis crucial to support sustainable growth.?ùWhile recognizing the importance of the cryptocurrency industry for the global economy, the G-20 also noted that it will introduce Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and anti-terrorist measures per standards of Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an intergovernmental body formed to fight money laundering and terrorist financing:?úWe will regulate crypto-assets for anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism in line with FATF standards and we will consider other responses as needed.?ùFurther, in the same segment of the declaration, G-20 participants expressed a positive stance on non-bank financial institutions, pointing out the potential advantages of technology in the financial sector, given that the tech innovators are managing associated risks:?úWe look forward to continued progress on achieving resilient non-bank financial intermediation.

We call on international standard-setting bodies (SSBs) to continue their monitoring of crypto-assets and their risks, according to their mandates, and assess multilateral responses as needed.""In July, a summary of provisional decisions made by the dedicated Finance Ministers & Central Bank Governors said that ?útechnological innovations, including those underlying cryptoassets [sic], can deliver significant benefits to the financial system and the broader economy.??Nevertheless, the document also listed various related problems, including tax evasion and AML concerns:?úCrypto-assets do, however, raise issues with respect to consumer and investor protection, market integrity, tax evasion, money laundering and terrorist financing.?ùStill, the actual recommendations for how to approach the cryptocurrency sphere at the international level were not presented, and the deadline was pushed to October 2018:??W]e ask the FATF to clarify in October 2018 how its standards apply to crypto-assets,??the summary read. It is unclear if those recommendations have been presented to date, as there has been no information from the G-20 regarding that issue.On Oct. 22, as the G-20 remained silent, Jeremy Allaire, the CEO of the Goldman Sachs-backed crypto investment app Circle, stated that crypto-related regulatory matters have to be addressed ?úat the G20 level.??Prior to that, on Oct. 19, the FATF said that by June 2019, jurisdictions will be obliged to license or regulate cryptocurrency exchanges and some firms providing encrypted wallets internationally as part of AML and anti-terrorism procedures. ¬†In separate news regarding international adoption and regulation of crypto technology, on Dec. 4, seven southern EU countries ??including France, Italy, Spain and Malta ??formed an alliance called the ?úMediterranean seven??with the aim to promote the use of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) among governments, as per Financial Times.

compensation through Ethereum or Bitcoin, and additional coins ...",29-Nov-18,"A company has released the beta version of its cryptocurrency mining platform ??the first iteration of ?úsimple to setup, highly automated??software that is aimed to appeal to newbies and seasoned professionals alike.","Cudo Miner says its offering is a GUI miner, which in other words is a graphic frontend for its interface. Its accessible technology means ?úinexperienced miners can install and sit back while the software automates everything else,??while experts have the chance to adjust advanced settings in line with their preferences.The program is able to mine multiple coins and switch between them based on which one is the most profitable at any given moment. Casual miners can leave Cudo Miner working in the background while they use their PC, ensuring that it does not interfere with their computer?ôs performance. Crypto enthusiasts with dedicated mining rigs can maximize earnings by tweaking algorithms on the ?úadvanced settings??page, where they can also see the results of all their benchmarks. Automatic overclocking and other features designed to boost profitability are being released by the end of the year, aiming to bridge the gap between traditional command line and GUI miners.These features are reinforced by a dashboard where miners can examine data related to their mining performance, look at historic earnings, view hardware information and power levels, as well as keep a close eye on the health of their devices.Cudo Miner users also have a choice in how they get paid ??they can receive compensation through¬†Ethereum or¬†Bitcoin, and additional coins will be included to the list in the future.The company says that its simplified approach to mining has struck a chord with crypto enthusiasts. Since launching a month ago, Cudo says that its software has attracted thousands of users in more than 130 countries. Available on Windows, Mac and Linux, the program updates automatically and makes the necessary changes as forks arise.Overall,¬†the crypto mining world has been suffering a crisis of confidence over the past few months ??but with Bitcoin miners alone¬†already generating $4.7 billion in revenue for the first nine months of 2018, there is still a lot to play for.Cudo Miner ardently believes that ?úGPU mining is definitely alive and kicking,??but its team argue that the strategies being adopted by some professional miners are diminishing their chances of making a decent profit. Altcoins are often the most profitable only for a few minutes or hours, so one needs to mine during this period to maximize gain. They say the emphasis needs to move away from focusing on a single coin or algorithm in favor of chopping and changing between an array of cryptocurrencies as well as choosing optimal settings ??elevating their chances of making it worthwhile.The company?ôs founders were motivated to find an accessible mining solution when they discovered ?úthe huge amounts of computing power on laptops, PCs and servers????with hardware often idle 60 percent of the time. As a result, they sought to develop a solution that kills two birds with one stone: stopping resources from being wasted while maximizing profitability from mining by removing barriers to entry.Of course, utilizing underused resources doesn?ôt detract from the fact that there are concerns about the energy consumption that goes into cryptocurrency mining,¬†with a recent report suggesting that it takes more energy to produce $1 of Bitcoin than it does to uncover a dollar worth of gold or silver.Cudo says it is the first crypto mining company to commit to being carbon neutral ??as well as making an active effort to get its users to follow suit.The company offsets its energy consumption by investing in carbon credits that aim to help good causes ??delivering funding to solar and wind power projects in India which deliver renewable energy to the national grid. Miners will soon be able to select options that make their own hardware carbon neutral, too.Over time, Cudo believes distributed computing has the potential to help a number of good causes, including cancer research, protein folding and seismic imaging.Within Cudo Miner, users can choose to mine anonymously in order to test the software without logging in. The revenue received goes to charity. It has also established a charitable arm called¬†Cudo Donate, where miners can convert their spare computing power into cash for good causes. This project has the goal of raising $1 billion in funding and computing resources for charities in the coming years.Cudo was founded by CEO Matt Hawkins and by Duncan Cook, and both men have been motivated by a desire to do something philanthropic. Cook has experience in building technology for good causes, and one of his projects was a disaster warning app for the American Red Cross, which has helped to save countless lives during natural disasters.Disclaimer.

exchanges or stand with the banks. #Government ¬∑ #Banks ¬∑ #Bitcoin ...",06-Dec-18,"On Monday, Dec. 4, the Chilean Supreme Court welcomed the decision of state-owned Banco del Estado to close the accounts of local cryptocurrency exchange Orionx. The new phase in the legal battle between the banks and several crypto exchanges ??including Buda.com and CryptoMarket (CryptoMKT), which had appealed against the denial of services ??may look somewhat sinister from the outside. But the main players of the Chilean crypto market assured Cointelegraph that the recent decision could not prevent them from operating in the country.","In March, two crypto exchanges ??Buda and CryptoMKT ??came out with a joint statement, claiming that some banks in Chile had closed their accounts. ?úWe are killing the whole industry long before exploring it and understanding its approach,??the release read. CryptoMKT also claimed that another bank received instructions not to deal with anyone who is related to cryptocurrencies. Both crypto businesses then urged the Chilean Association of Banks (ABIF), which coordinates all the private and foreign financial institutions in the country, to intervene ??or at least clear up its stance on cryptocurrencies.A response was given within a few days of the statement: The president of ABIF, Segismundo Schulin-Zeuthen, told Chilean business outlet Diario Financiero that the banks were free to moderate relations with their clients. Schulin-Zeuthen also criticized Buda and CryptoMKT for ??generating] false judgments about the institutional role of the ABIF,??while the association?ôs role consisted of discussing and analyzing existing regulation in the finance sector.The bank that closed the crypto exchanges??accounts was soon revealed to be Itau Corpbanca, the fifth-largest bank in Chile, along with a branch of Latin American banking giant Itau Unibanco and Scotiabank Chile, a branch of a Canadian banking group by the same name. They were soon joined by Banco del Estado ??the only public bank in the country managing up to $52 billion in assets, as of 2017.Later in April, Itau Corpbanca opposed the crypto industry?ôs stance that the move was illegal and insisted that the closure of accounts result in an internal investigation. According to Itau, Buda had failed to comply with their Anti-Money Laundering (AML) policy. Moreover, the bank accused the exchange of failing to verify the users??data, as Buda?ôs website only requested basic information during the registration and did not verify the identities of its clients.The whole story, including the media coverage and official responses, fueled a huge backlash on social media. As Cointelegraph reported in April 2018, crypto enthusiasts blamed financial institutions for ?úa huge negative blow to Chile's reputation as a rational, innovation-friendly, free market economy,??stating that those actions ?ústifle innovation.??Twitter users created a hashtag #ChileQuiereCrypto (Chile wants crypto), urging the government to resolve the problem with crypto exchanges.In mid-April, the Chilean crypto exchanges decided to fight for their rights and started a legal battle, applying to Tribunal de Defensa de la Libre Competencia (TDLC) ??an independent, anti-monopoly institution established to ensure that free competition rules are not violated. Buda and CryptoMkt, joined by Orionx (whose accounts had also been closed), had filed a petition against several banks, including Itau Corpbanca, Scotiabank and Banco del Estado.Guillermo Torrealba, Buda?ôs co-founder and CEO, summed up the whole turmoil in an comment for Cointelegraph:?úThere hasn't been one regulator, legislator or government official saying that cryptocurrencies aren?ôt legal, it was just the decision of a very powerful sector of the economy: the banking industry.?ùOnly a few weeks after the first complaint, TDLC ruled against Banco del Estado and Itau Corpbanca, forcing them to re-open Buda?ôs accounts.Later in June, the same decision was made in favor of Orionx. As the company wrote on its official Facebook page, the anti-monopoly court ordered Banco del Estado and Banco de Chile ??another major bank in the country that was mentioned in the initial lawsuit ??to reopen Orionx?ôs accounts within three days.It would be logical to assume that the long-term battle would force Chilean authorities to introduce relevant legislation on cryptocurrencies to prevent such situations in the future.In late March, following the first news of the closure of the crypto accounts, Diario Financiero spoke to Chile?ôs Minister of Finance Felipe Larrain. He was reassured that both the Ministry and the Central Bank of Chile had started exploring the possibility of crypto regulation to normalize the situation:?úTechnical progress and the digital economy bring people new services; we have to consider this fact. But when the regulation issues arise [...], we have to avoid situations that could affect the normal development of markets and healthy competition.?ùChile?ôs central bank reaffirmed that intention in May. Mario Marcel, the president of the institution, proposed incorporating the crypto regulation in order ?úto allow having a registry of participants in these activities and thus have information to monitor the associated risks.??Marcel also stated that the industry needed more transparency and consumer protection ??as cryptocurrencies could possibly be involved in illicit activities, such as money laundering and the financing of terrorists.Six months after the recent claim, there is still no sign of a legal framework for cryptocurrencies in Chile. In October, local deputies instead introduced a resolution on blockchain adoption to the lower house of the country?ôs parliament. Miguel Angel Calisto and Giorgio Jackson ??along with eight other MPs ??urged Chile?ôs President Sebastian Pinera to implement blockchain in all the country?ôs public areas, along with carrying out studies on the advantages of decentralized security and energy solutions.A new, unexpected chapter began on Dec. 4, when the Chilean Supreme Court published its resolution in favor of Banco del Estado. As cited by major Chilean newspaper El Mercurio, the document reads:""The resolution taken July 11, 2018, is revoked. It is declared in its place that the protection appeal filed by Orionx SPA against the Banco del Estado is rejected.""The Supreme Court further explained that the actions conducted by Banco del Estado were not ?úunjustified??or ?úillegal,??as the bank acted correctly and did not violate any rules of the Chilean constitution. Moreover, the top court stated that the cryptocurrencies ?úhave no physical manifestation and no intrinsic value.??The document also proclaimed that they are controlled neither by a government nor by a corporation, citing the characteristics of crypto as reasons for letting banks refuse services to the exchange.Despite the apparent harshness of the Supreme Court?ôs decision, Chilean crypto exchanges believe it will have no bearing on the case. Reacting to the aforementioned resolution, Orionx published a statement on their official Facebook page:?úOrionx wants to clarify that this ruling does not imply the closure of the company?ôs current bank accounts. [D]ue to the fact there is a current precautionary measure issued by TDLC, which prevents banks from closing the mentioned accounts.?ùMoreover, Orionx emphasizes that it disagrees with the arguments provided by the Supreme Court and regrets the latest ruling.Buda shares the same stance, also citing the ruling of the anti-monopoly court in its official statement:?úThe valid ruling in our favor pronounced by TDLC assures that our bank accounts will be maintained during the trial that is held in the mentioned court.?ùMoreover, the firm insists that the Supreme Court?ôs resolution on Orionx has nothing to do with their company. Speaking to Cointelegraph, Buda?ôs co-founder Agustin Feuerhake said:?úThe situation with Buda.com has been slightly different. Since [the] very beginning[,] we had a relevant KYC [Know Your Customer] policy. We also tackle money laundering and terrorism financing, so the bank's argument to close an account does not apply to our case. There are no anonymous users on Buda.com.?ùFeuerhake further added that the Chilean courts are not evaluating the ban on crypto exchanges, but rather seek ways to ?úcondemn banks for abusive behavior??toward them.As the decision of the Supreme Court did not mention Buda and CryptoMKT, it might be a turning point in the plot. The legal framework for crypto, if introduced, could side with crypto exchanges or stand with the banks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Weapon in US Trade War or Attempt to Manipulate Bitcoin? Blockchain ...",12-Dec-18,,"This article has been updated to reflect comments from Ran Neuner on his involvement in the project.The man behind the ?úBlockchain Terminal??(BCT) initial coin offering (ICO) has reportedly been outed as a financial criminal who concealed his former identity from employees and investors, according to crypto news outlet The Block. An investigation into the circumstances was published Dec. 11.The BCT project and its affiliated firm, CG Blockchain, are alleged to have raised as much as $31 million in an ICO to launch a crypto-focused version of the ubiquitous Bloomberg Terminal ??a highly successful financial data and trading tool for the financial sector.According to The Block, BCT?ôs glossy ?úinstitutional-grade??tool for crypto ?útrading professionals??had at its helm a man who operated as ?úShaun MacDonald,??but was allegedly a convicted fraudster, Boaz Manor. Manor received a four-year prison sentence in Canada in 2012 for siphoning $106 million from a Toronto-based hedge fund that he co-founded, according to Toronto news daily, The Star.The Canadian fund reportedly had $800 million in assets under management at its peak from 26,000 investors. In April 2018, The Globe and Mail reported that Manor agreed to repay nearly $6.6 million to make up for missing diamonds from the fund. At the time, Manor reportedly said that he does not know where the diamonds are located.The Globe and Mail further states that Manor agreed to a lifetime ban from the securities industry, after which he supposedly withheld his conviction and identity from his colleagues at BCT. Manor went so far as ?úgrowing a beard and [dying] his hair red,??according to The Block. While formally assigning the company?ôs presidency to Bob Bonomo ??former chief information officer at $500 billion asset management firm AllianceBernstein ??MacDonald was reportedly the primary driver behind the BCT venture.Although it marketed its $999 ?úBlockchain Terminal??to crypto hedge funds ??a 32-inch HD terminal with a hardware private key ??the company is alleged to have raised most of its funds via a lucrative $31 million ICO for its native BCT token, which launched in September 2017.One of the project?ôs purported investors is the high-profile crypto analyst and host of CNBC?ôs show Cryptotrader Ran Neuner, who tweeted his endorsement of the Blockchain Terminal in June, and is alleged to have invested as much as $1.3 million in the company?ôs ICO, according to two unnamed sources.Neuner yesterday stated he had ?úlost a ton??of his own cash investing in the BCT ?úfraud,??but accused The Block of ?údefamatory??misreporting, and falsely claiming to have reached out to contact him for comment on the story.When reached for comment, Neuner clarified to Cointelegraph that he invested around $300,000 ??not $1.3 million ??in the BCT project. He explained over email that he ?úat one point [...] advised the company, specifically about how to infiltrate the crypto market,??noting that he assisted in finding ?úhigh volume traders??to test the screens.However, Neuner continued, after receiving a ?útip off??in the early fall that MacDonald was actually Boaz Manor, he confronted him without receiving confirmation. Neuner added:?úDue to the suspicion [I] resigned immediately from the advisory and have been working with a bunch of other investors ever since to gather enough credible information to go to the authorities and report the project.My investigation is ongoing.?ùBesides MacDonald?ôs misrepresentations, the Block reports that Bonomo ?úquietly resigned??from BCT this summer, after which MacDonald supposedly revealed himself as Manor to his employees, and purportedly ceased to pay them. With Manor?ôs whereabouts ?úunclear,??BCT has now rebranded as BCT Inc., and announced in late October that its Terminal would go on sale to the public.In June, the Bloomberg Terminal announced that it would begin listing crypto exchange Huobi's Cryptocurrency Index, as well as nine crypto-trading pairs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mayweather will pay $300,000 in disgorgement, a $300,000 penalty, and $14,775 in prejudgment interest. Khaled will pay $50,000 in disgorgement, a $100,000 penalty, and $2,725 in prejudgment interest.Moreover, Mayweather agreed to collaborate with the investigation and not to promote any kind of securities during the next three years. Khaled has been barred from securities promotion for two years. SEC Enforcement Division Co-Director Steven Peikin commented on the issue:""Investors should be skeptical of investment advice posted to social media platforms, and should not make decisions based on celebrity endorsements. Social media influencers are often paid promoters, not investment professionals, and the securities they?ôre touting, regardless of whether they are issued using traditional certificates or on the blockchain, could be frauds.""Mayweather began promoting Centra?ôs ICO in September 2017, claiming that he was already using his Titanium Centra card to use digital currencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) in his business transactions. At that time, Centra?ôs ICO was the third ICO being promoted by Mayweather.Just a few weeks later, Khaled joined Mayweather in promoting Centra?ôs ICO by making public his acquisition of a Titanium Centra Card on his Instagram account.Later in November 2017, the SEC warned that ICOs ¬†that were endorsed by celebrities could be illegal. The commission claimed that personalities who promote token sales could be violating the ?úanti-touting??laws if they do not reveal the compensation they received from their endorsements.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Over ...",27-Nov-18,An established digital asset exchange has announced it is holding a summit in Singapore to explore new opportunities in the marketplace ??creating a platform where crypto enthusiasts can detect industry trends and debate what the future holds after a volatile year.,"Bibox, an exchange enhanced by artificial intelligence (AI,) is hosting a¬†summit on Nov 29, and hopes the event will give investors an insight into the strategic changes that lie ahead in 2019.The company says that token bonds are likely to take center stage at the day-long conference, amid questions over whether they could become a new, widespread investment opportunity. It is reported that ICO crowdsales have lost momentum in recent months ??prompting entrepreneurs to find new ways to connect with investors.Following a year of dizzying highs and lows, Bibox also says demand for fixed-income assets is on the rise, leading to rising interest around token bonds. This will be another topic that?ôs discussed at length ??with a panel convening for an hour-long discussion on the impact these financial instruments may have on the blockchain industry.Token bonds are a modern take on bonds, one of the oldest financial instruments in the world. In a way, they are a form of debt and they enable blockchain-based businesses to raise money. Bond holders normally receive a sum of money when they mature, along with regular interest payments over the bond?ôs lifespan. These assets can be traded, and their price can fluctuate.Two other panel discussions are planned. One will offer Singapore?ôs perspective on token bonds, while the other will explore the role of institutional investors and market makers in the secondary market. Representatives from Bibox are going to give a presentation to kick off proceedings, with delegates from Vocean, a decentralized crypto financial ecosystem, to follow.The conference comes hot on the heels of two big milestones: Bitcoin?ôs 10th birthday, and Bibox?ôs first anniversary.Over the first 12 months of operation, the exchange says it has opened offices in seven countries. It has also launched the BiboxLab, an ?úinternational blockchain hub??based in New York which aims to support top-tier projects with funding, consulting services, technical guidance, legal counsel, marketing, office space and media management.BiboxLab?ôs goal is to uncover practical projects that innovate and provide ?údisruptive solutions to existing pain points??while embracing compliance and regulation. Vocean, mentioned earlier, is one of the first participants. The ecosystem enables fixed-income products such as loans, bonds and derivatives to be issued and traded. Additionally, it can provide blockchain projects with credit ratings and unlock new ways for them to raise funds.Bibox is also going to launch a European fiat exchange early next year, supporting fiat currencies including the Swiss franc, British pound and the euro. The platform will also reportedly allow contract trading in the future.In a year, Bibox says it has managed to amass more than 2,000,000 registered users ?ì¬†and according to CoinMarketCap it is the eighth-largest exchange in terms of daily trading volume, which at the time of writing stood at more than $290 million.Executives from the company wrote a letter of thanks to users, marking the anniversary by stating: ?úBibox is planning to launch a series of derivatives so as to meet the diversified needs of investors, striving to become a one-stop transparent and smart assets management platform, and we do hope you, as always, to continue supporting us in the years to come.?ùThe Bibox exchange is available to download from Apple?ôs App Store and Google Play for Android devices, and software has also been released for Windows PCs and Macs.

The second entails a mandatory licensing regime for payment service providers, who will be required to apply for one of three licenses based on the nature and scope of their activities.The first license, for ?úmoney-changers,??regulates providers primarily for money laundering and terrorism financing risks; a more comprehensive ?ústandard payment institution license??is available for entities that transact over $3 million per month, provided they hold a digital money float of no more than $5 million.

Our editorial team would like to apologize for the error.,"The cantonal court of Zug, Switzerland has shut down cryptocurrency mining firm Envion AG for an alleged unauthorized Initial Coin Offering (ICO), German news outlet Handelsblatt Global reported Nov. 28.Envion was established in Switzerland by Michael Luckow and Matthias Woestmann as an off-grid mining company that claims to use decentralized, clean energy like hydroelectric and solar to power its mobile mining units. Envion reportedly raised around $100 million through an ICO conducted in mid-January of this year.However, the project eventually turned into a fight between the two partners as Woestmann accused Luckow of producing more tokens than had been initially suggested. Woestmann subsequently conceived a capital increase that reduced Luckow?ôs share. The dispute resulted in a court trial.The cantonal court in Zug has reportedly shut the firm down and ordered its liquidation, while noting the complete absence of any auditing function or board. Woestmann, however, continues to accuse Luckow of not providing relevant information about the ICO, while Luckow reportedly states that Woestmann has always intended to push the company into liquidation.Although Luckow will purportedly try to continue fighting for the firm in a bid to save the original concept, financial supervisors have reportedly appointed an investigator to ensure the liquidation is ?úunavoidable.?ùNo announcements have been made as of yet for a claims procedure for investors in the case of liquidation. Liquidations are officially announced through the Swiss Official Gazette of Commerce (SOGC), which provides information about how claims should be filed.The initial investigation into Envion?ôs ICO by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) began in July. FINMA?ôs investigation into the case found that, during its ICO, Envion accepted approximately 100 million francs (around $100.01 million at the time) from over 30,000 investors in return for issuing Envion?ôs native tokens (EVN), ?úin a bond-like form.?ùThe investigation focused on ?úpossible breaches of banking law resulting from the potentially unauthorized acceptance of public deposits??during the token sale.At press time, EVN token has seen a 186 percent increase in price over the day, and is trading around $0.08, according to CoinMarketCap.

Binance KYC Breach ??Did It Happen, ...",29-Nov-18,A new bulletin from Russian internet security company Kaspersky Labs published Nov. 28 states that crypto mining malware became increasingly popular among botnets in 2018.,"Stealth crypto mining attacks ??also know as cryptojacking ??work by installing malware that uses a computer?ôs processing power to mine for cryptocurrencies without the owner?ôs consent or knowledge.According to Kaspersky, after the crypto market bull run subsided in Jan.-Feb. 2018, interest in cryptojacking also briefly tapered off ??yet it has nonetheless remained a consistent and current threat throughout the year.Number of unique users attacked by miners in Q1?ìQ3 2018Among botnets in particular, during the Q1 2018 cryptojacking ?úboom,??the share of cryptojacking malware downloaded by botnets, out of total files, hit 4.6 percent ??as compared with 2.9 percent in Q2 2017. The bulletin extrapolates that botnets are therefore becoming increasingly viewed as a means of spreading crypto mining malware, with cybercriminals increasingly viewing cryptojacking as more favorable than other attack vectors.Kaspersky thus found that Q3 2018 saw a decline in the number of DDoS attacks from botnets, arguing ?úthe most likely reason being [...] the ?òreprofiling??of botnets from DDoS attacks to cryptocurrency mining????I]f executed properly, [cryptojacking] can be impossible for the owner of an infected machine to detect [...] the reprofiling of existing server capacity completely hides its owner from the eyes of the law. Evidence suggests that the owners of many well-known botnets have switched their attack vector toward mining. ¬†For example, the DDoS activity of the Yoyo botnet dropped dramatically, although there is no data about it being dismantled.?ùOther factors in the rise of cryptojacking are the low ?úentry threshold??for cybercriminals; web browser based code, such as Coinhive, is one option, and there are also a range of ?úready-to-use affiliate programs, open mining pools, and miner builders??at attackers??disposal.The report notes that ?útime will tell??what the impact of the November crypto market crash will be on the prevalence of cryptojacking infections.In mid November, cybersecurity research team McAfee Labs uncovered new Russia-made mining malware, which uses consumer devices to mine Monero (XMR), running almost without a trace.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

McKinsey & Company, another international management consulting firm, estimates that IoT will have an $11.1 trillion impact on the global economy by 2025.It is clear that it is an already large industry set to grow exponentially over the next decade and beyond.IoT refers to a network of connected devices that are capable of collecting and exchanging data. IoT-enabling platforms provide a common network for devices to dump their data and a common language for these devices to communicate with each other, allowing people to use it to their benefit.Communication devices ??or sensors ??are embedded in everyday objects, such as phones, TVs, indoor climate systems, electrical appliances, cars, traffic lights and industrial equipment. These sensors continuously emit data about the working status of connected devices and allow them to send and receive data from each other via the cloud (internet).IoT platforms will then analyze the data to extract valuable information and share it with other devices to initiate specific commands or actions. ¬†The result is a better human experience, greater automation and improved efficiencies.In manufacturing, for example, all the different components and machines in the factory could be fitted with sensors that continuously transmit system health data back to the mobile apps of operators. Potential problems can then be identified and fixed before a breakdown happens, saving companies time and money.If we look at a direct-to-consumer product, such as air conditioners, units can be embedded with a sensor that emits data regarding the system health and temperature. Data will be continuously downloaded and analyzed in an IoT network. If an issue comes up, customer support can then be contacted for repair work before you even know there is a problem.The use cases of IoT are near enough endless, from keeping medical devices in patients in good working order to fighting rapid deforestation in rainforests across the globe.But IoT networks are not perfect. Devices are constantly sharing critical information back and forth over the internet, which makes it a prime target for hackers. Privacy and security are therefore major concerns.Some of the more infamous IoT attacks include the Mirai Botnet DDoS (distributed denial of service) attack that affected internet service for nearly the entire East Coast of America, including Twitter, Netflix and Reddit.There was also the planned hacking of a Jeep to expose some of the vulnerabilities in IoT devices in cars and the catastrophic consequences it could have when breached, along with the very real FDA recall of 500,000 IoT connected pacemakers in September 2017 because security loopholes were discovered that could allow hackers to tamper with the medical devices once implanted in patients.Blockchain at its core is a cryptographically secured, distributed ledger that allows for the secure transfer of data between parties.Traditional IoT systems are dependent on a centralized architecture. Information is sent from the device to the cloud where the data is processed using analytics and then sent back to the IoT devices. With billions of devices set to join IoT networks in the coming years, this type of centralized system has very limited scalability, exposes billions of weak points that compromise network security and will become incredibly expensive and slow if third-parties have to constantly check and authenticate each and every micro-transaction between devices.Smart contracts in blockchain networks will allow devices to function securely and autonomously by creating agreements that are only executed upon completion of specific requirements. It not only allows for greater automation, scalability and cheaper transfers (no third-party needed to oversee transactions) but these smart contracts can also prevent overrides by individuals that want to use the data for their own benefit. Information is shared across a decentralized, cryptographically secured network, meaning it becomes very difficult to compromise the network security.Finally, with a centralized network, the risk of a single point of failure disabling an entire network is a very real possibility. A decentralized blockchain network mitigates this risk with millions of individual nodes that transfer data on a peer-to-peer (p2p) basis to keep the rest of the IoT network running smoothly.Several blockchain platforms focusing on IoT are emerging as the industry gets bigger.One of the first blockchain IoT platforms is IOTA. It was designed specifically for the Internet of Things and provides a transaction settlement and data transfer layer for connected devices.They?ôve created the Tangle platform, which developers describe as ?úgoing beyond blockchain.??It?ôs a blockless, cryptographic, decentralized network, where, instead of outsourcing network verification, users verify transactions of other users.The benefit is twofold: It allows for greater scalability and it eliminates the need to pay transaction fees to miners. Both these factors are essential in a practical IoT network that could require the processing of billions of micro-transactions between devices on a daily basis.IOTA has also entered into several important partnerships including:But IOTA is not the only IoT-focused blockchain platform, others include:HdacThe Hyundai Digital Asset Company (Hdac) is applying blockchain technology to quickly and effectively communicate, handle identity verification, authentication and data storage between IoT devices. The system incorporates a double-chain system (public and private) to increase transaction rate and volume, which makes it ideally suited for IoT devices.The technology is applied to smart factories, smart homes and smart buildings for machine-to-machine transactions and operation between IoT devices.VeChainVeChain is a global enterprise-level public blockchain platform. The blockchain is used in a variety of ways, with one focus being on advanced IoT integration in cold-chain logistics by using proprietary IoT devices to track key metrics ??such as temperature ??throughout the entire journey. In addition, the platform can hold automobile passports by creating digital records of cars ??including repair history, insurance, registration and even driver behavior throughout its lifecycle.Medical and healthcare applications are also possible by using end-to-end tracking of production processes of medical devices and allows patients to securely share their biometric data with their doctors to enable real-time monitoring. VeChain also uses IoT technology for luxury goods by embedding smart chips within the luxury products so that brands can monitor their sales channels in real-time, thereby preventing illegal overstock trading and allowing consumers the ability to verify the authenticity of the luxury product.WaltonchainWaltonchain is created through a combination of RFID and blockchain technologies for effective IoT integration.They primarily focus on tracking processes and products in the supply chain, where the technology can be applied to high-end clothing identification, food and drug traceability and logistics tracking by implanting RFID tags and reader-writer control chips into products. Information regarding the status of products is then downloaded for analyses onto a secure blockchain.StreamrStreamr is an open-source blockchain infrastructure to power the world?ôs data economy and to give people back control of their own information. Their technology can be implanted into everyday objects ??such as cars ??to record data including traffic, potholes and local fuel prices. The user can then choose to sell this data to fellow car users or highway agencies, or buy information from other users that will help them make real-time decisions in a connected smart city.Information travels through the decentralized peer-to-peer network to get posted on the network nodes and is powered by the network?ôs native cryptocurrency (DATACOIN).This is just a small sample of blockchain-based IoT platforms and the list keeps on growing as the industry evolves. Other projects include Ambrosus, IoT Chain, Atonomi, Chain of Things, IoTeX, OriginTrail, Slock.it, BlockMesh, Helium, Moeco, FOAM, Fysical, Grid+ and Power Ledger.Great strides in development have been made in this area, but blockchain?ôs application in IoT is far from perfect and several key challenges will have to be overcome before we will see the complete benefit of blockchain in IoT be realized.ScalabilityCan blockchain networks cope with the sheer volume of data that is expected to be produced by IoT devices in the next five to 10 years without slowing down transaction speeds or the flow of data? IOTA addresses this issue specifically by not using a blockchain-based decentralized network, instead opting for their Tangle platform. But this is just one project. More well-known blockchains like Ethereum and Bitcoin have long been suffering from scalability issues and is not suited for the amount of data IoT devices are producing.SecurityDecentralized blockchain networks provide a high level of security, but what level of weakness (if any) do the IoT devices create at the point where they connect to the network? Devices themselves will have to be secured as well to prevent hackers from tampering with them.InteroperabilityCross-chain interoperability will have to be addressed and improved if we truly want to leverage the benefits of interconnected smart devices. If not, we can end up with a situation where we are connected to multiple isolated decentralized networks that work well for their purpose but can?ôt necessarily talk to other devices for which they were not specifically designed.Legal, compliance and regulationThe allocation of responsibility will have to be closely examined. How smart contract actions are regulated in the world outside of blockchain will also have to be stipulated. For example, who takes responsibility if an IoT-connected medical device implanted in a patient takes an action based on certain smart contract rules but ends up causing the patient harm? Is this the responsibility of the manufacturer or the IoT platform? If the IoT platform is blockchain-based, it will be decentralized without a controlling entity, so pinpointing an accountable party might present a problem.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The superior trial court of British Columbia ruled that Ethereum (ETH) tokens, which were mistakenly sent by the plaintiff, Singapore blockchain startup Copytrack, to the defendant, Brian Wall, must be returned to Copytrack.The defendant mistakenly received 530 Ethereum coins from Copytrack instead of 530 Copytrack (CPY) tokens that he was supposed to receive after participating in Copytrack?ôs initial coin offering (ICO).

This creates a technical problem of competing interests within the technology.?ùMastercard is by no means the first to tackle the limitations of anonymity within blockchain systems; two high profile privacy-focused altcoins, Zcash (ZEC) and Monero (XMR), are both designed with similar concerns in mind.ZEC uses Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) technology, an alternative algorithm for authenticating distributed ledger entries, in which transacting parties provide proof of validity, but all other information remains encrypted, including their identities. Monero, meanwhile, uses stealth addresses to mask identities by enabling a sender to create a random one-time address that is based on the transaction receiver?ôs published address.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But, with resistance from the Financial Services Commission (FSC), the corporation was not able to pursue its plans. With no changes made to the regulatory framework regarding ICOs in South Korea, how has Kakao been able to raise funds to create a blockchain project?On Nov. 19, The Hankyoreh ??a business-focused mainstream media outlet in South Korea ??exclusively reported that Kakao is planning to raise around $300 million to develop its own token.A source told the local publication that the majority of the funds have already been secured by Ground X, a subsidiary of Kakao that focuses on blockchain operations. The source added that a Chinese venture capital firm is said to be involved in the token sale.?úThe target amount is $300 million and Kakao is very close to securing its target. A China-based venture capital executive held a meeting with Ground X in September and, even at the time, Ground X was planning to raise $300 million.?ùAs a private sale, only registered, accredited and approved institutional investors are allowed to invest in the token sale of Kakao. Considering that all of Kakao?ôs meetings with accredited investors were held confidentially ??without any information provided to the media, unlike the Telegram ICO in May ??the company planned a rigorous path to raise funds in a way that does not violate regulations in Japan, South Korea and even the United States.On Nov. 27, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Jay Clayton said that the vast majority of ICOs that are presently in the global cryptocurrency market are considered securities under existing U.S. laws and emphasized that if companies plan to raise funds through a token sale, firms either need to register with the SEC or conduct a private sale.""We don't believe Bitcoin is a security. Many of the ICOs that you see and you talk about, they are securities. And if you're going to offer or sell securities, you have to do so in compliance with our laws. We've been clear about that, the recent actions further emphasized that our securities laws apply to the ICO space. And if people are going to raise money using Initial Coin Offerings, they either have to do so in private placement or register with the SEC.?ùCompanies prefer not to conduct private token sales unless they are absolutely certain that the product they offer will attract large investors, because a private sale is just as difficult and complex in a legal point of view as raising venture capital funding.It can be argued, given the involvement of local financial authorities ??and possibly the SEC ??that conducting a private token sale is more resource-intensive than a traditional venture capital funding round.For a company in the size of Kakao, it was of the utmost importance to be compliant with both local and international regulations, rather than completing the target amount of funding. This naturally led the conglomerate to conduct a private sale over a public sale, which could have been more lucrative.Ground X is based in Tokyo, Japan, and the decision to legally establish its blockchain initiative in Japan instead of South Korea by Kakao was likely a strategic move to circumvent various regulatory hurdles pertaining to cryptocurrencies that still exist in the country.Throughout the past three months, South Korea has seen significant progress in cryptocurrency regulation. The government officially provided commercial banks permission to freely work with cryptocurrency exchanges and provide virtual bank accounts to digital asset businesses.Blockchain technology has also been recognized as one of the core pillars of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, alongside big data and artificial intelligence (AI), and the government has established initiatives to bring young talent into the blockchain sector.However, the stance of the government toward ICOs still remains uncertain and while local financial authorities were expected to provide an official announcement regarding the regulatory state of domestic ICOs by the end of November, given the time frame, the government is expected to delay the announcement once again.Whether the ICO conducted by Kakao is a private sale or a public sale, because policies in South Korea remain undetermined, the firm cannot risk being in conflict with local regulations by prematurely conducting a private sale with institutional investors.In December 2017, Chosun ??another business-focused mainstream media outlet in South Korea ??reported that the government was considering the possibility of allowing institutional investors to participate in private token sales. However, 11 months have passed and the government is yet to make a decision on the matter.Legally, Kakao needed to conduct its private sale in Japan with an entity based in Japan. But, the implications of its blockchain initiative on its relationship with the Financial Services Commission (FSC) remain in question.In July, Choi Jong-ku ??the chairman of the FSC, South Korea?ôs main financial watchdog ??disapproved of Kakao?ôs initial plans to run a public ICO and opposed the idea of Kakao completing a token sale in overseas markets. Commissioner Choi said, warning Kakao:?úEven if there is no prohibition on cryptocurrency or digital asset trading, there is a possibility that it [Kakao ICO] may be regarded as fraud or multi-level sales according to the issuance method. Since the risk is very high in terms of investor protection, the government has a negative stance on the ICO.?ùSpeaking to Hankyoreh, a Kakao representative said that while the fundraising could be considered as a private sale, the company does not consider it as one:?úKakao has been securing strategic partners to help improve and grow the global blockchain ecosystem by obtaining new capital. It could be recognized as a private sale, but it?ôs not open to individual investors and is participated by institutions that are partnering with Kakao. Currently, it is not possible to finalize exact numbers regarding the funding round, and the company is not in the position to openly share which companies are involved in the initiative. Kakao needs to communicate with its partner companies first.?ùOn Nov. 27, Nikkei ??a mainstream publication in Japan ??reported that the Financial Services Agency (FSA) held a meeting on the Nov.26 to discuss the state of ICO regulation in the country.During the meeting, the FSA and other local financial authorities discussed policies surrounding cryptocurrency exchanges and the possibility of allowing accredited investors access to domestic ICOs.According to local reports, the FSA still restrict public token sales.The token sale conducted by Kakao and Ground X falls under the newly created category by the FSA as a private sale aimed at institutional investors. Legally, the token sale of Clay is fully compliant with the regulations of Japan, South Korea, the U.S. and every other major market.Japan and the U.S. both allow private token sales if approved by local authorities, and South Korea enables both corporations and investors to invest in foreign ICOs.The cryptocurrency market of South Korea has been able to demonstrate signs of improvement in terms of infrastructure and regulation.Most recently, Upbit ??the country?ôs largest cryptocurrency exchange based on daily trading volume provided by CoinMarketCap ??successfully obtained an information security management system (ISMS) license from the Korea Internet and Security Agency (KISA) after passing an evaluation phase conducted by the government agency using a criteria with over 253 subsections.Lee Seok-wu, the CEO of Dunamu ??a company invested in by Kakao and the parent company of Upbit ??said:?úSince early 2018, Upbit has been working tirelessly to improve the platform?ôs internal management system and security measures to obtain the ISMS license. With top class security experts and tested security systems, the company will continue to create a safe trading environment and protect the data of its investors.?ùThe local cryptocurrency and blockchain space has seen progress, but multi-billion dollar companies like Kakao are leaving South Korea to establish blockchain initiatives that well surpass the $100 million mark ??which, in Silicon Valley, is acknowledged as a mega round.In October, Min Byung-doo ??the chairman of Korea's National Policy Committee ??warned the government about an inevitable scenario in which companies move out of the country to kickstart operations that could be worth billions of dollars in the long term.Referencing the $4 billion ICO of Block.one and EOS, chairman Min heavily emphasized that the government could no longer dismiss ICOs, given the positive impact token sales could have on the economy of South Korea.?úThe government cannot dismiss ICOs. It needs to allow companies to conduct an ICO. [ICOs have] become a new trend in the global market, and it is the responsibility and ability of the government to embrace new technologies. We can see that the flow of investment is clearly changing compared to ICOs and angel fundraising. The ICO has raised $1.7 billion for Telegram and $4 billion for block.one. It is getting bigger and bigger.?ùLine, a direct competitor to Kakao as the dominant messaging application based in Japan, has also recently released a new token called LINK.The cryptocurrency and blockchain initiatives of Kakao and Line are structurally very similar. Both companies finance cryptocurrency exchanges ??with Kakao?ôs Dunamu operating Upbit and Line directly overseeing the operations of BitBox. The two firms have also created their own unique cryptocurrencies to support their long-term vision in blockchain development.The Japanese government?ôs forward-thinking approach toward regulating the cryptocurrency market has led two internet conglomerates from South Korea (Line is owned by Naver, the largest search engine in South Korea) to develop and release their own tokens in Japan, with funding from domestic and international companies.Kakao?ôs Clay is said to have raised $300 million, and the market valuation of Link remains uncertain. However, the two cryptocurrencies have the potential worth billions of dollars collectively in the long run, purely based on the amount of funding the two projects have raised.Line?ôs Link, for instance, can be used at 94,000 locations in Japan when converted to Line points on the BitBox exchange, demonstrating a level of merchant adoption which most major cryptocurrencies are still yet to see.?úIn addition to using LINK Points for other DApp services in the LINK Ecosystem, residents in Japan can exchange LINK Points with LINE Points before converting them into JPY at par to make payments at over 94 thousand locations across Japan with LINE Pay, or make purchases in various LINE services,??the Line team explained.The scenario which Korea's National Policy Committee chairman Min Byung-doo feared in October has come to realization faster than expected. Kakao?ôs abrupt private token sale could potentially lead to the government of South Korea speeding up the process of regulating the local ICO market to facilitate the growth of the local cryptocurrency sector.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, Fortune cites ?úa source close to Conflux??as revealing that an unnamed ?úprominent??Chinese internet search company has backed the venture.Fellow co-founder Fan Long, a professor at the University of Toronto, told Fortune that:?úConflux?ôs main idea is how to make the whole blockchain scalable. We?ôve changed the structure of the blockchain so that it?ôs no longer a chain in the sense that it records each block based on what its parent block says [...] Contrary to popular belief, true decentralization isn?ôt sacrificed to increase throughput.?ùThe ?úmain idea??entails using a directed acyclic graph (DAG): different from a blockchain in that it entails a topologically ordered system in which different types of transactions run on different chains in the network simultaneously. In the crypto and blockchain space, the protocol is notably already in use as the basis of the IOTA Foundation?ôs Tangle architecture.Conflux combines DAG with a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus algorithm, and also allows network users to run smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps) on the network. Long told Fortune that running smart contracts and DApps on a scalable, high-throughput protocol will enable both to gain traction beyond the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) space, and to extend to the finance and insurance sectors.According to Long, the Foundation will release its testnet by the end of February 2019, and its main network by 3Q 2019.While the scalability issue continues to be avidly discussed in the blockchain community, a recent study by the leading global post-trade financial services firm Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) found that distributed ledger technologies (DLT) such as blockchain are in fact scalable enough to support daily trade volumes of the U.S. equity market.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The partnership?ôs main focus is on cybersecurity, privacy, energy efficiency and interoperability, all in full compliance with EU law.As Mariya Gabriel, commissioner for the Digital Economy and Society, underlined welcoming the established of the EBP:Blockchain is a great opportunity for Europe and Member States to rethink their information systems, to promote user trust and the protection of personal data, to help create new business opportunities and to establish new areas of leadership, benefiting citizens, public services and companies (sic)Back in the fall, ResearchAndMarkets.com published a new report dubbed ?úEU5 Blockchain Technology Market (2018-2023).??In the report, the EU is expected to increase its investment into blockchain- and DLT-related projects from $94 million in 2018 to $386 million by 2020. The positive view within the document toward the blockchain industry in Europe is based on several crucial facts: The EC is liberalizing the industry?ôs regulation and it creates a new task force entrusted with blockchain expertise.Another move toward blockchain was made in October this year when the European Parliament formed a resolution titled ?úDistributed ledger technologies and blockchains: building trust with disintermediation.??The resolution states that DLT ?úcould potentially affect all sectors of the economy,??but it focuses on several important spheres: finances, health care, transport, education, copyrights, public governance, data protection, and some others.The agreement shows that the Parliament has set the plans for the EC to ensure that its proposed policies would be realized, taking into account benefits of the DLT implementations and warning about some of the related risks. This resolution is a crucial document, as it means that Parliament articulated several main features.The potential of DLT implementation in the health care and medical sector was among the first initiatives discussed by the European Union. My Health My Data (MHMD), the EU-funded project, has been aimed ?úto use blockchain technology to enable medical data to be stored and transmitted safely and effectively.??The resolution signed in October highlighted that blockchain would ?úimprove data efficiency and the reporting of clinical trials in the health sector, allowing digital data exchange across public and private institutions under the control of the citizens/patients.?ùFor the EU, the main focus of the implementation of blockchain technology is on the protection of personal data (followed by the General Data Protection Regulation, known as GDPR), which gives ?úpeople more control over how they store, manage and use personal data generated online,??says DECODE, another blockchain project funded by the EU. According to the document, blockchain ?úshould protect the privacy of sensitive health data??and allow ?úcitizens to control their health data and benefit from transparency thereon, and to choose which data to share, also with regard to their use by insurance companies and the wider health care ecosystem.?ùIt also underlines the importance of improving the health care sector with DLT ?úthrough electronic health data interoperability, identity verification and a better distribution of medication,??as well as improving the management of health care systems.There are several major advantages of DLT implementation for the financial sector within Europe. One of them is, definitely, the significance of the blockchain technology in financial intermediation by ?úimproving transparency and reducing transaction costs and hidden costs by better managing data and streamlining processes.?ùThe EC and local regulatory authorities are to monitor trends of DLT implementation in the finance industry and are encouraged to do ?úthe research and experimentation that major financial institutions have undertaken in the exploration of the capabilities of DLT.?ùThe European Parliament also expressed its concern about the ?úvolatility and uncertainty??of cryptocurrencies. It requires the EC and the European Central Bank (ECB) ?úto provide feedback on the sources of volatility of cryptocurrencies, identify dangers for the public, and explore the possibilities of incorporating cryptocurrencies in the European payment system.?ùThere are certain risks related to initial coin offerings (ICOs), and the resolution stresses the ?úlack of clarity with regard to the legal framework applicable to ICOs,??that could negatively affect the investment and funding potential of ICOs. The Parliament asks the EC and national regulatory authorities ?úto identify criteria that enhance investor protection and articulate disclosure requirements and obligations for the initiators of ICOs??to avoid risks and dangers related to ICO projects.The certainty and clarity of the crowdfunding in the crypto space could increase investor and consumer protection and reduce ?úthe risks stemming from asymmetric information, fraudulent behaviour, illegal activities such as money laundering and tax evasion.?ùMeanwhile, the Distributed ledger technologies and blockchains resolution has more political significance than legal, as the EC is not required to do anything in response to these requests.Last week, four major blockchain companies ??including Ripple, the NEM Foundation, Emurgo (based on the Cardano blockchain) and ?úsmart ledger??development firm Fetch.AI ??formed ?úBlockchain for Europe??Association. It is aimed to help the EU ?úshape the global agenda??on blockchain by providing education on the technology?ôs potential and by developing ?úsmart regulation??of the blockchain industry.The EC does not appear to be fully involved in promoting a global regulatory framework for the blockchain and cryptocurrency ecosystems. The general idea is to focus on promoting the regulations of the technology on national levels.A vivid example of it is another declaration signed on December 4 between seven southern European countries ??including France, Italy, Cyprus, Portugal, Spain, and Greece. It was reportedly initiated by Malta, commonly known as the ?úBlockchain Island??of Europe. This declaration calls the EU for help¬†to ?úpromote DLT that is most associated with cryptocurrencies but is increasingly being used by governments to offer services to citizens.?ùSwitzerland is another European country, but not a member state, that has friendly regulation on the blockchain and crypto industries.Europe has the ambitions to become ""the global leader in the field of DLT,"" which can be seen from the number of initiatives taken place over the 2018 year. Still, it might want to consider bringing more legal power to them rather than just ?úraising the awareness.??

The malware attacks Windows Servers by deploying various evasion methods to skirt its detection. Per Check Point data, several detection engines have registered significantly decreased detection rates, while sensor logs have shown a growing number of KingMiner attacks.The firm has been monitoring KingMiner activity over the past six months and concluded that the malware has evolved in two new versions. The blog post further explains:?úThe malware continuously adds new features and bypass methods to avoid emulation. Mainly, it manipulates the needed files and creates a dependency which is critical during emulation. In addition, as part of the malware?ôs ongoing evolution, we have found many placeholders for future operations or upcoming updates which will make this malware even harder to detect.?ùCheck Point has determined that KingMiner uses a private mining pool to bypass any detection of their activities, wherein the pool?ôs (API) is turned off and the wallet is not used in any public mining pools. The attacks are reportedly widely spread around the world.According to the company?ôs findings, the malicious software attempts to guess passwords of the servers it attacks. Once a user downloads and executes the Windows Scriptlet file, it reportedly identifies the relevant Central Processing Unit (CPU) architecture of the device and downloads a payload ZIP file based on the detected CPU architecture.The malware eventually destroys the relevant .exe file process and deletes the files themselves, if older versions of the attack files exist. Check Point also notes that the file is not an actual ZIP file, but rather an XML file, which will circumvent emulation attempts.As Cointelegraph reported yesterday, Russian internet security company Kaspersky Labs has found that crypto mining malware became increasingly popular among botnets in 2018. During the Q1 2018 cryptojacking ?úboom,??the share of cryptojacking malware downloaded by botnets, out of total files, hit 4.6 percent ??as compared with 2.9 percent in Q2 2017.Botnets are reportedly therefore becoming increasingly viewed as a means of spreading crypto mining malware, with cybercriminals increasingly viewing cryptojacking as more favorable than other attack vectors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On the one hand, this profusion is one of the key driving forces behind innovation in the crypto sphere. But on the other, it arguably acts as a block against widespread adoption, as the lack of unified standards means that some morally questionable endeavors give the rest a bad name.","The past year has seen an intensifying push toward producing international standards for the cryptocurrency industry. Groups such as Global Digital Finance have risen with the aim of fostering universal standards on how crypto platforms are run, just as groups like the Blockchain Association and CryptoUK are now focused mostly on standards at a national level. Such organizations count the likes of Coinbase, Bitstamp, Circle and others as members, despite often being less than a year old.However, while holding the promise that crypto will avoid stringent government regulation by learning how to regulate itself, there's also a concern that global standards might hamper innovation, and that crypto ??almost by nature ??is not meant to be standardized.As Teana Baker-Taylor, the executive director of Global Digital Finance (GDF), told Cointelegraph, the London-based association aims ?úto demonstrate that self-governance and driving best practice is critical for the industry's consumers and their confidence in crypto assets, as the sector continues to mature, and in concert with developments in regulation.""In other words, GDF is seeking to develop voluntary guidelines and codes of conduct for exchanges, token sales, wallet providers, cryptocurrencies and ratings websites, and while it was launched only in March, it already has a strong roster of members.At the end of October, payments company Circle (and owner of¬†Poloniex) joined it as a founder member, adding itself to a list that includes Coinbase, R3, ConsenSys and Diginex. Meanwhile, Baker-Taylor affirms that the association has also begun having dialog with lawmakers and public institutions.?úWith over 250 individuals and firms, global regulators and policy makers have paid attention to the GDF Code and the commitment of the community, and this is an important start. Understandably, the signal from many regulators has been mixed, but most we are engaging with are supportive of maintaining an open dialogue to ensure they do not stifle this important innovation.?ùYet, GDF isn?ôt only working on codes of conduct for token sales and crypto-exchanges. They're also busy devising a¬†taxonomy of cryptocurrencies, which seeks to divide coins into three broad types: payment tokens, financial asset tokens and consumer tokens.Given that there is plenty of¬†confusion and conflict among the world's governments on how to define crypto, this attempt to produce a clear taxonomy of cryptocurrencies is much needed. However, seeing as how such organizations remain largely averse to classifying cryptocurrencies as money and/or assets, there will remain the worry that GDF's taxonomy (and codes) may simply be disregarded by governments and regulators.Despite possible opposition or resistance from governments, the groups like the GDF could have emerged precisely because of increasing government interest in crypto regulation. Anyway, their emergence at such a time presents the crypto world with a golden opportunity to get involved in the shaping of government policy.In October, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) ??an intergovernmental group established by the G7 to combat money laundering ?î¬†adopted a variety of changes to its standards concerning the regulation of virtual assets. And encouragingly for the crypto industry, these new recommendations were focused specifically on preventing money laundering and the financing of terrorism, leaving plenty of freedom for exchanges, token issuers and crypto-services to operate in accordance with the needs of their users and own logic. It said in its recommendations from October:""The FATF Recommendations require monitoring or supervision only for the purposes of AML/CFT [Anti-Money Laundering/Countering Financing of Terrorism], and do not imply that virtual asset service providers are (or should be) subject to stability or consumer/investor protection safeguards, nor do they imply any consumer or investor protection safeguards.""Put simply, the FATF sees no reason to do anything about the volatility or decentralization of cryptocurrency, which implies that it wants to leave the much of decentralized nature of crypto intact. That said, other governmental groups want to do more than simply prevent crypto from being used for crime or terrorism.For example, Felix Hufeld ??the chairman of the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) ??affirmed his view in October that the global community needs to produce international standards governing the handling of ICOs:""The number (of ICOs) and the volume (of money) per ICO are both getting higher. Investors have mostly minimal rights.""Still, while this could foreshadow a push for intergovernmental standards that dictate what ICOs can and can?ôt do, such moves remain at a very preliminary stage. And because governments have been slow to act here, this provides an empty space which groups like GDF ??or the newly formed Blockchain for Europe association (which includes Ripple and the NEM Foundation as members) ??could advantageously fill to the benefit of the wider crypto industry.And while the world's governments and governmental bodies slowly wake up to the idea of regulating cryptocurrencies at a global level, the crypto industry is increasingly producing new trade institutions that are beating them to punch when it comes to developing standards.In March, CryptoUK was¬†established, with the aim of producing self-regulatory standards for the United Kingdom?ôs cryptocurrency industry. But its chairman, Iqbal V. Gandham, tells Cointelegraph, there?ôs also an appetite at CryptoUK for international coordination.""CryptoUK?ôs focus since our launch earlier this year has been on the U.K. ??securing proportionate regulation here is our priority, but we support collaboration on regulatory approaches internationally, in particular learning the lessons ??both good and bad ??from other jurisdictions.?ùGiven that most other self-regulatory trade bodies ??such as the¬†Blockchain Association, the¬†Japan Virtual Currency Exchange Association and the¬†Blockchain Foundation of India ??are working primarily at the national level, global collaboration on regulatory approaches will be vital if the crypto industry is to enjoy uniform international standards.And to an increasing extent, there does appear to be a growing willingness among crypto-related companies to work with each other on developing (international) standards. In August, the Gemini, Bitstamp, Bittrex and bitFlyer exchanges announced the formation of the Virtual Commodity Association Working Group. And like Global Digital Finance, its aim is to devise global industry standards on how crypto-exchanges are run and cryptocurrencies are traded.There is, then, every reason to believe that the crypto industry will, sooner or later, develop international standards and adopt them at large scale. But the question remains: Will such standards simply give the public greater confidence in crypto, or will they also have the unfortunate side effect of constraining innovation??úIn many industries, regulation and standards are seen as stifling innovation. However, in the crypto-assets market, regulatory and legal ambiguity poses challenges for growth. ¬†Clarity around the 'rules of the road' will better enable innovators to access new ways of accessing global capital and support emerging nascent business models with greater confidence.?? Teana Baker-Taylor, executive director of Global Digital FinanceSimilarly, there's a risk that standards could put compliant companies at a disadvantage compared to those corporations or cryptocurrencies that simply (and perhaps illegally) flout them. Given that the decentralized nature of cryptocurrency provides people and groups with greater scope to disregard centralized authority, this is a real danger.However, once international standards are in place and recognized, it becomes much likelier that the companies that do observe them will have a much better chance of working with and influencing regulators ??something which will ultimately put them at a competitive advantage. And as Teana Baker-Taylor concludes, there?ôs a very strong appetite among crypto-related firms to foster and follow strong universal standards.?úGDF's community is made up of hundreds of individuals and businesses from around the world who share a vision of growing a mature, stable, transparent and fair crypto-asset industry. The desire and commitment of the community to instil and drive sound business practices is enormously compelling and in our experience, is far more prevalent than those who do not ascribe to this mindset.??

as a medium for everyday consumer transactions, price volatility ...",19-Nov-18,"This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision","In the year of bear markets and curbed enthusiasm, stablecoins have emerged as the asset class with which many of the crypto community associate high hopes for the long-anticipated mass adoption. As these cryptocurrencies have come to be viewed as a promising tool to alleviate volatility ??presumably the major hurdle in the way of digital assets becoming a vehicle of everyday transactions for millions of consumers ??they enjoy massive media coverage, community and investor attention, and merit somewhat over-the-top labels such as ?úThe Holy Grail of cryptocurrencies.?ùYet great success comes with great responsibility, and increased public attention has brought increased scrutiny on many of the more salient projects, resulting in a pool of pointed criticisms. These arguments deserve a thorough review by anyone who aspires to keep up with the developments in the segment of the crypto industry that perhaps moves even faster than others.As any other important sector in the field, the stablecoin space presents a major ideological battlefield for crypto purists and crypto pragmatists. The models that have gained the most traction to date ??namely, the fiat-backed stablecoins such as Tether ??are also those that sacrifice the traditional virtues of decentralization and antagonism toward the legacy of financial system. Pragmatists believe that, albeit they indeed may be the artifacts of the centralized economy, asset-backed stablecoins can spark adoption and serve as a bridge between the incumbent economy and its more decentralized future.Speaking to Cointelegraph, Eric Ervin, the Founder and CEO of the financial firm Blockforce Capital, summarized this outlook:?úThe true value that asset-backed stablecoins bring to the blockchain industry is that they will provide a realistic solution for the use of cryptocurrency in everyday transactions. For all the promise and hype surrounding Bitcoin and various other altcoins as a medium for everyday consumer transactions, price volatility and a lack of widespread understanding has curbed mass adoption. Stablecoins offer a viable solution as anyone that has used a credit card or made an electronic funds transfer has essentially already used and can understand ?òe-cash.??Stablecoins offer the ability to decrease settlement times from days to seconds and remove many, if not all, intermediaries, such as credit card networks, payment processors, clearing networks (e.g., ACH, RTP, SWIFT), and even banks.?ùFunctional advantages notwithstanding, a large share of the crypto community would never rally behind any centralized currency that is pegged to the U.S. dollar. Over the last several months, an enthusiastic movement of developers determined to produce viable decentralized alternatives came up with a variety of often ingenious and complex stablecoin designs. These models either use other digital assets as collateral, or are not collateralized at all, relying instead on algorithmic mechanisms of price stabilization.As much as they are distinct in terms of design, volatility-reducing mechanisms utilized, and faithfulness to the tenets of crypto anarchism, these types of stablecoins are different in the ways they could fail.Off-chain collateral designs: TetherThe problems with fiat-backed cryptocurrencies, of which Tether (#8 according to CoinMarketCap.com at the time of this writing) is an unavoidable example, are all well known. Tether is centrally governed, which means that users have to trust the company that issues the asset entirely. At the same time, the Tether user agreement explicitly states that the system does not ?úguarantee any right of redemption or exchange of Tethers by us for money.??For someone who is not a priori excited about cryptocurrencies, this could be enough to render the idea of exchanging proper U.S. government-backed dollars for some digital tokens a questionable one. Finally, the entity behind the asset claims that every USDT in circulation is backed by one U.S. dollar in the back account, but failed to undergo a proper third-party audit so far. As Eric Ervin puts it:?úTether still lacks the operational standards competitors are promising. A huge head start will only take them so far and Tether has been reluctant to provide information about the soundness of the USD reserves backing USDT until Tether provides a full, unbiased attestation of USDT?ôs soundness, they will have a long way to go to establish legitimacy with institutional organizations.?ùSpeaking of fiat-backed stablecoins more generally, Rafael Delfin, Head of Research at Brave New Coin, voices centralization concerns:?úWe consider this emerging type of crypto asset of great significance to further the development of the ecosystem. However, not all stablecoins are created equal, as some projects allow issuers to freeze funds. I personally favor the projects building stablecoin protocols that embrace Bitcoin's core values of decentralization, algorithmic issuance, and censorship resistance.?ùYet despite all these woes, Tether has an undeniable upper hand over its more sophisticated and more decentralized competitors: it has been live for a while now, and, with a capitalization of over $1.5 billion, it enjoys a relatively wide global use. This alone is a reason to consider it viable and useful.Nevin Freeman, co-founder of Reserve, spoke with Cointelegraph from Angola, where he is currently discussing with local banks and telecom carriers a roadmap for making cryptocurrency a reality there. The weapon of choice would be a fiat-backed stablecoin:?úYes, we think Angola is a place where stable cryptocurrency really makes sense to hold and use. Most developed nations don't really need it right now. We think that ?òfiatcoins??are the best available stablecoins right now, but that their days may be numbered since governments can decide to shut them off, and have done so for equivalent virtual currencies in the past.?ùSpeaking of the possibility of collapse, Freeman explained that the users of off-chain collateral coins face two major types of risks: the counterparty risk, which has to do with the need to trust that those who manage the money centrally will act in good will, and the third-party risk, which is about outside actors such as hackers and governments posing a threat to users??money. The latter threat, Freeman hints, is a real one. However, he believes that such a scenario for fiat-pegged assets would be less dreadful than the potential collapse of their more decentralized alternatives:?úI think the asset-backed coins may get shut down but most likely in an orderly way.?ùDigital asset collateral designs: DaiThis class of stablecoins comprises those assets that are pegged to other cryptocurrencies or baskets of them. The Dai Stablecoin is issued and controlled by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) called Maker. Even though Dai?ôs price also mirrors that of the U.S. dollar, it is actually backed by ETH. In order to obtain Dai, users would have to transfer ETH, which will be locked by the DAO. The system relies on a decentralized price-feed ?úoracle??to adjust the token value. ¬†As with other crypto-backed stablecoins, Dai?ôs major potential point of failure comes from volatility inherent to collateral assets ??from routine ?úcollateral volatility,??to vulnerability, to so-called ?úblack swan??events, whereby the value of the underlying asset dramatically collapses at a speed faster than the system can sustain. ¬†With regard to Dai itself, stablecoin sceptics such as Preston Byrne often¬†point out that the token is overcollateralized to ETH, so that creating $1 worth of Dai will take >$1 worth of ETH. Byrne is convinced that this does little beyond increasing users??exposure to the value of the underlying coin ??and, by extension, to its volatility. However, thorough¬†analysis of the Maker protocol suggests that the model is robust and capable of ensuring stability. Researchers at Reserve believe that while Dai lacks price stabilization mechanisms and will be unable to scale to become a global solution, it has sufficient checks to keep investors safe from catastrophic price crashes.Non-collateralized designs: BasisFinally, some developers choose to avoid pegging their stablecoins to other assets altogether. Instead, they might design self-sustaining models that incorporate additional layers of game-theoretic incentives to encourage self-interested user behavior that would be instrumental in sustaining the peg. Perhaps the most famous representative of this cohort, Basis, relies on two types of assets that coexist on the platform: proper stablecoins and supporting bonds. If the coin?ôs price goes below the designated peg level, the system issues bonds that it sells to coin holders, who are supposed to be attracted by the perspective of being paid interest from the future coin issuance. Meanwhile, the coins used to buy the bonds are destroyed, thus reducing supply and driving the price back up.As many¬†observers point out, this incentive structure is clearly premised on the expectation that the platform will grow indefinitely, which is not warranted. The bond payout to a user depends on how many other users are subsequently drawn to the system, so in order for the protocol to work as expected, coin holders have to share unquestioned faith in it. Moreover, as a¬†study by Reserve analysts highlights, Basis??strategy stipulates an initial period of off-chain stabilization, i.e. pegging to fiat for some time before switching to full on-chain stabilization. The plan also suggests that on this off-chain stage the coin will be backed by no more than 80 percent of the actual value, leading the researchers to expect that ?úunder conditions that are arguably quite likely, the peg is likely to fail irrecoverably.?ùAs this brief survey demonstrates, existing stablecoin models represent a spectrum of tradeoffs between functionality, scalability, and decentralization, and offer varying levels of security and vulnerability to failures. Intensifying competition in the field will definitely push the more viable designs to the surface, and there is hope that eventually solutions that are at the same time secure, scalable, and decentralized will emerge in the market. Meanwhile, experts look at the sector?ôs near prospects rather optimistically. As Brave New Coin?ôs, Rafael Delfin, points out,?úYear-over-year Tether's market capitalization has grown 4x and its 24-hour volume has increased by 10x. We do expect similar growth for the entire stable coin sector, and while strong network effects and first mover advantage will still be at play, these factors will be less relevant for assets that are almost perfect substitutes.?ùEric Ervin echoes this sentiment:?úWe firmly believe that consolidation will take place and the projects that survive will be the ones that garner the most adoption. While the stablecoin market doesn?ôt have to be a winner take all environment, market cap will be won by having more trust than the competition. That competition will only help increase interest and confidence, and in-turn adoption of the asset class.?ùYet the road to wide adoption will certainly be a rocky one. As Nevin Freeman reminds, it is critical to avoid hasty steps, as both people?ôs money and reputation of the crypto industry at large will be on the line:?úWe think the some of these coins will fail, and that this could be very bad. Why? Because people in Angola and other places with high inflation will be the ones holding them, and it would be really bad to decimate the savings of people in that kind of situation. So we feel an immense responsibility to get people in the industry to not mess things up, and we are scrambling to figure out how to do that. In addition to being really bad for those people, it could be really bad for the cryptocurrency movement, since the first major real-world use case of crypto could lead to financial catastrophe, giving regulators the political will to shut things down.??

Crypto Market Trading ??Inside ...",20-Nov-18,"Initial Coin Offerings (ICO) are facing a regulatory ?úcompliance trilemma,??according to a recent study released Nov. 19. The research, funded by regtech platform iComply and ?úsupported by??Canadian non-profit national research organization Mitacs Canada, was carried out by the University of British Columbia (UBC).","To prepare the report, UBC?ôs research team investigated the ICO space over the course of six months, focusing primarily on North America, but also delving into some other countries and jurisdictions. The team conducted 45 qualitative interviews with individuals in the ICO space, including representatives of the finance, law, and science sectors of the field.Per the study, ICO issuers face a ?útrilemma,??wherein they can only address two of three objectives at a time, those being ?úhaving a compliant offering,???úreaching a distributed pool of investors,??in a manner that is ?úcost-effective.??The researchers define compliance as following regulations in the home jurisdiction of both the issuer and investor.While a broadly distributed pool of investors is said to be the principal benefit of an ICO as a funding mechanism, the cost of complying with financial regulators becomes ?úmuch greater??if the investor pool becomes more distributed.?úIf issuers forgo these costs, the risk of being non-compliant rises significantly. The result is a trilemma, whereby issuers currently must forgo one of these goals to realize the other two, or to compromise on all three,??the study explains.The trilemma further reveals four basic approaches available to ICO issues, which are ?úthe Maverick ICO,???úthe Private ICO,???úthe Hybrid ICO,??and no ICO at all. The first option refers to ignoring compliance for maximizing ICO reach and cost effectiveness, which reportedly runs a huge risk of regulatory enforcement.The second approach focuses on targeting only accredited and institutional investors by sacrificing distribution, which may not affect cost-effectiveness but raise challenges in secondary market trading control.Regarding the Hybrid ICO, the report reads that it ?úcompromise[s] on all three dimensions by issuing in select markets, resulting in bounded cost effectiveness, compliance and investor scope,??resulting in a combination of risks.The researchers found that companies wishing to undergo an ICO sought relief from the trilemma through relevant regulatory authorities. Participants in the study reportedly called for amendments to regulation, including clarifications of existing regulation and development of ?úfundamentally new??regulatory definitions and frameworks.The study concludes that this ?útrilemma??has ?úsubstantially limited [the] potential??of ICOs, noting:?úMany actors with legitimate ventures that could benefit from ICOs are likely holding back, due to combination of confusion over how exactly they might comply with financial regulations within and across jurisdictions, and the prohibitive costs of doing so manually.?ùAs Cointelegraph recently reported, ICO performance in the third quarter of 2018 was in part characterized by ?úoverall disappointment,"" in comparison with previous quarters.Last week, Cointelegraph reported that in a self-described ?úfirst,??the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had imposed civil penalties against two ICOs over their failure to register their token sales with the agency.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The c0ban cryptocurrency ...",28-Nov-18,,"A Japanese video platform service called c0ban.tv has started its expansion into English-speaking markets, the startup team has reported to Cointelegraph. The platform has its own cryptocurrency and has been developed by the LastRoots corporation, famous for its ¬†popular cryptocurrency exchange.The c0ban.tv platform publishes short video ads, already with over 50,000 active users and 5 million transactions per month, according to the startup team.The concept of c0ban is based on combining blockchain and video advertisement. The core idea of c0ban is that a user can get paid with c0ban coins (RYO) for watching advertisement videos posted on c0ban?ôs web application.This c0ban mechanism is similar to websites that offer reward points to their users. In order to get rewards, a user needs to sign in to the c0ban.tv web application and watch the videos that appear on the screen.There are three huge problems for the video advertising market that the industry faces right now: Users tend to skip video ads, they do not watch them in full and the current ads are not cost effective. According to the c0ban team, their application and platform can solve these problems by paying users to watch videos.According to c0ban fans blog, there are stores in Japan that accept RYO. Users can, for instance, watch a few videos, get paid with c0ban cryptos and buy lunch with those coins. Although the number of such stores is still quite small, LastRoots is actively working to expand, a company?ôs representative told Cointelegraph.?úC0ban is named after a Middle Ages Samurai coin, named Koban. C0ban is the first challenge for us to spread the technology to the world. We will be pleased if we could provide a trigger to people to feel the revolutionary world of decentralized consensus,??reads the c0ban website.According to the website, c0ban is a proof-of-work (PoW) cryptocurrency that is designed to make it easy for everyone to enter the blockchain world. The genesis block was mined on Dec. 15, 2016 and so far over 26,000,000 RYO have been issued. The target number is 88,000,000 RYO.–°0ban.tv held one of the first ICOs in Japan in July 2016 and succeeded in raising about $6 million. Its app was released in February 2017, with the cryptocurrency listed on a Japanese exchange in March 2017. Today, the c0ban trade volume has reached 100 million trades.On December, c0ban will be listed on the Latoken exchange and will be able to be traded for Bitcoin and Ethereum. The c0ban cryptocurrency has been on the market since Dec. 15, 2016, when it was officially launched. The c0ban startup team has decided to move forward and expand worldwide, making its way to a broader audience.Disclaimer. Cointelegraph does not endorse any content or product on this page.

Opting for a centralized platform means they run the risk of being exposed to security vulnerabilities, but decentralized alternatives have had the¬†disadvantage of being sluggish ??with slow speeds and the lack of scalability making them impractical for use on a major level.BEXAM plans to offer tailor-made solutions to enterprise-level businesses ??and firmly believes that blockchain has the potential to become the beating heart of mainstream society.Its executives believe that targeting larger companies will create a trickle-down effect where blockchain becomes increasingly relevant. By exposing greater numbers of entrepreneurs to its potential, and proving what the technology has to offer, BEXAM thinks ?úrelevant, everyday uses of blockchain [will] emerge more and more.?ùA rethink of its organization has resulted in a rebrand ??with a new logo and a refreshed website that informs visitors of its objectives for the future.Explaining the bold decision to move away from its original plans, the company wrote in a¬†blog post: ?úExchanges were available left and right, and while our technology was definitely significant, there weren?ôt many other distinctive factors to put us above the rest of the competition.?úIf we threw ourselves into the sea of exchanges, we would only get swept away and our technology?ôs potential would never truly be revealed.?ùDespite the change in focus, BEXAM stresses it will welcome startups ?úwith a similar philosophy and desire to build applications??using its platform.According to the company, the dizzying speeds that BEXAM?ôs network is capable of achieving are thanks to a consensus algorithm known as Proof of Rounds (PoR,) which was developed by a Japanese engineering team.BEXAM?ôs PoR algorithm generates blocks in order rather than at random, and functions based on a hierarchy of Master Nodes, Super Nodes and Normal Nodes. It also optimizes node productivity as a result of allocating hierarchal jobs/specializations to nodes.DAG stands for ?údirected acyclic graph????and according to¬†BEXAM?ôs white paper, the network structure of this distinctive technology means that ?úthe number of nodes in each layer increases automatically, allowing information to be transmitted without major speed reduction.?ùBEXAM has provided a table which compares the maximum number of transactions per second it can handle to other systems. While Bitcoin can manage 7 TPS and Ethereum musters 20 ??with mainstream rivals such as PayPal and VISA managing 450 and 56,000 TPS respectively ??BEXAM?ôs algorithm can handle 40 million.The Proof of Rounds algorithm was devised by a development company known as Early Works, and BEXAM has an exclusive partnership agreement to build a platform based on this concept.A token which is native to BEXAM?ôs ecosystem, known as BXA, will serve as a way for enterprises to pay network usage fees and transaction fees.A private token sale for BXA is taking place from Nov 19 to 29, with a public IEO sale to be announced soon.Disclaimer.
