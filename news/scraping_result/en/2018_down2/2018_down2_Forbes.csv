Photocredit: Getty,"Bitcoin is the dominating crypto currency. The recent crash only managed to get its price back to where it was last December, which means it is still profitable compared to a few years ago. Yet the digital currency that started it all suffers from some serious flaws, from volatility to its core algorithms.This November, bitcoin broke the floor and went below the $6,000 limit. As of this writing, it has even broken the $5,000 and $4,000 lines.  While some specialists expected the currency to reach $25,000 in December, the market is currently “bearish.”There have been many speculations around the cause: some suggest the massive sell-offs, while others point to news around Goldman Sachs abandoning plans to launch a crypto currency trading desk. Some simply suggest that since many bitcoin investors are young adults, they want to cash in before college. Another theory is the fear of huge capital gain taxes. But before all of these, we had the bitcoin cash split. To understand the split, which affected the community so heavily, it is important to know how bitcoin “upgrades.”Unlike regular (centralized) software, where a company owns a product and can upgrade it anyhow it likes, decentralized protocols such as bitcoin rely on several thousands of nodes, each of them having a version of that software installed. And there is no central place to automatically upgrade them (like Playstore) as that would defeat the purpose of decentralization. For this reason, all nodes must agree on the best way to go forward.This process is called “forking,” where a new version of the software is created and installed on all nodes. And if the fork is a “hard fork,” this means the new software becomes “incompatible” with the old one, effectively resulting in a new coin. This is what happened to bitcoin cash.It’s worthwhile to mention that bitcoin cash was a fork from bitcoin itself, and the reason behind it was limitations in bitcoin’s algorithm. Bitcoin can only process seven transactions per second, compared to Visa’s 24,000. As bitcoin adoption was increasing, the scalability problem had to be solved.Bitcoin uses a CPU-intensive “Proof of Work” algorithm which requires the miners to spend a lot of time and resources on computing a hash value that verifies the transactions. In return, the one who solves the algorithm is rewarded in bitcoin.To increase the chances for reward, GPU mining, ASIC mining and mining pools were created, with Bitmain currently being the largest. But the increased hashing power of these pools (with a majority of them residing in China) also increased the worries of a 51% attack, where one pool could overwrite the entire history of bitcoin and redefine the contents in all wallets.To solve the problem of scalability, the community had to make a choice. The problem could be solved by increasing the “block size” (limited to 1 MB) which would allow a lot more transactions to be processed per second, but this meant that smaller devices would have no chance to compete with the bigger players. It was an issue of centralization vs. decentralization. The community could not agree, and bitcoin cash was born as the alternative which could process more transactions per second.On November 15, bitcoin cash officially split into two versions: Bitcoin ABC (Adjustable Blocksize Cap) and Bitcoin SV (Satoshi’s Vision). To keep it simple, both factions had different views on how bitcoin cash should proceed, with one of the debates circulating around the block size. But in this split, the chains tried to eliminate each other, partially fighting over who should own the BCH symbol.When a crypto currency splits, the users on the old chain double their coins, as they receive a similar amount of coins on both sides of the chain. But without a mechanism called “replay protection,” if a user spends coins on one of the chains, it automatically deduces from the other one as well.Bitcoin SV initially refused to implement this feature. Furthermore, Craig Steven Wright (who supports bitcoin SV) explicitly stated that they will use any hash power under their control to 51%-attack the bitcoin ABC chain, resulting in a “hash war.” For these reasons, many exchanges stopped supporting bitcoin cash altogether until the dust settled off.For now, it seems like bitcoin ABC has won the civil war, but the entire crypto community has paid the price. Bitcoin is driven by opposing visions; some consider it a vehicle for investment, while others want to use it to “pay for your coffee.”Bitcoin did a great job in introducing crypto currencies to the world. It seized the right moment after the financial crisis, and became the first and biggest digital currency. Yet, it has many flaws: volatility, scalability and the power-hungry algorithm are some of them.For these reasons, we now have stablecoins and third and fourth generation blockchain projects which rely on totally different algorithms (some that rely on RAM instead of CPUs). Bitcoin probably cannot become a mainstream payment mechanism, but it has paved the way for other digital currencies. If its flaws are not fundamentally resolved, it might lose its dominating position."

Trading goods online with a global currency certainly sounds like a method that could expedite commerce without the complications of a national currency.Bitcoin is by far the most successful currency today, but with any new frontier, there are bound to be some obstacles. Despite bitcoin’s recent popularity, there are some serious risks when it comes to investing in cryptocurrency.With so many people rushing to invest, it’s important to be aware of the concerns surrounding this new market. Here are the top 10 risks of bitcoin investing and how to avoid getting caught up in them.10. The Volatile And Fluctuating MarketThe price of bitcoin is constantly changing. As of November 6, 2018, one bitcoin was worth $6,461.01. If you happened to purchase a bitcoin on December 17, 2017, the price topped $20,000. Days later, on the 24th, buyers could not sell their investment for more than $14,626. The bitcoin market is constantly rippling back and forth. With such an unpredictable market, there’s no telling if you will get a return on your investment. To avoid a massive loss, keep a vigilant eye on the market. Make small investments; they’ll be more beneficial long-term.9. CybertheftCryptocurrency is technology-based, which leaves this investment open to cyberattacks. Hacking is a serious risk, since there is no way to retrieve your lost or stolen bitcoins. Many reports suggest that many buyers lose their investments on exchanges and mining losses. Exchanges are more likely to hacked -- even if you have the protection of a smart wallet. Additionally, if you do have a wallet and you forget or misplace your key, there is rarely a way to retrieve your coins. Carefully research your cryptocurrency wallets to be sure you have the most reliable option.8. FraudIn addition to hacking, there is a fair amount of fraud in the bitcoin market. Buyers and sellers are looking to trade bitcoins online, but since their rise in popularity, some of these exchanges can be fake. The Consumer Finance Protection Bureau and the Securities and Exchange Commission have warned against these transactions where unsuspecting investors are duped out of their bitcoins in fraudulent exchanges. This lack of security creates a big risk for investors. While systems have been created to deal with these problems, security remains a big issue.7. Little Or No RegulationCurrently, the bitcoin market is operating without any major regulations. The government doesn’t have a clear stance on cryptocurrency; the market is just too new. It is not taxed, which can make it enticing as an investment opportunity. However, a lack of taxation could lead to problems should bitcoin pose as competition for government currency. As of now, cryptocurrency is not a widely accepted currency, but the future is ever-changing. There’s no telling what the state of the bitcoin market could be in a few years’ time.6. Technology RelianceBitcoin is an online exchange that is reliant on technology. Coins are digitally mined, exchanged via smart wallet and kept in check using various systems. Without that technology, cryptocurrency is worth nothing. Unlike other forms of currency or investment, there is no physical collateral to back it up. With gold, real estate, bonds or mutual funds, you own something that can be exchanged. With a currency that is 100% technology-based, bitcoin owners are more vulnerable to cyberthreats, online fraud and a system that can be shut down.5. Block WithholdingNew bitcoins are created by solving mathematical equations called “blocks,” which are created every time there is a bitcoin exchange online. A mining pool can use computational power to mine a block and hide it from honest miners instead of reporting the new block to the network. Essentially, this is a way for a select few to reap the benefits, while others are left with nothing.4. Limited Use Bitcoin may be a step toward a new monetary exchange; however, there are few companies that accept it as a viable form of currency. Currently, a few online stores, including Overstock, Newegg and Monoprix, allow cryptocurrency exchanges. Additionally, bitcoin owners can use their funds for travel with companies like AirBaltic, Air Lituanica and CheapAir.com. Unfortunately, many companies do not recognize bitcoin as a legitimate exchange.3. Financial LossBitcoin has been referred to as a Ponzi scheme, with people at the top benefiting off the ignorance of others. As more people buy into bitcoin, it creates a bubble economy. When the bubble bursts, bitcoin will essentially become useless; there will be many people holding onto cryptocurrency, intending to sell but unable to unload. There is no return on the investment, which can equal a very painful financial loss2. Currency Or Investment Opportunity?Cryptocurrency could be an effective online currency exchange; however, buyers buy up bitcoins with the intent of investing much as they would with stocks. Some even think that bitcoin is a solid investment opportunity for retirement. With a constantly shifting market, no regulation and zero physical collateral, investors can end up losing everything they invest. While bitcoin could potentially pay off, the best way to approach this investment is with caution. Small investments and small steps will cover more ground.1. Young TechnologyCryptocurrency is still a very young technology. Bitcoin came about roughly 10 years ago, and it has yet to develop into something solid. With so many changes occurring in the past few years, there’s no telling how the market will evolve. Bitcoin as we know it may become useless in the future. The best way to approach this new investment opportunity is with caution and due diligence. Take the steps to secure your funds, and brace yourself for the future of the market.The information provided here is not investment, tax, or financial advice.

Earlier in the week, a bounce in the bitcoin price had led some to speculate the worst was coming to an end for the bitcoin and cryptocurrency market.Bitcoin is down some 80% from its all-time highs at the end of 2017, a drop which has dragged many other coins down as much if not more, as investors worry long-expected institutional investment in the sector will fail to materialize.Bitcoin has been on a downward trend all year, although the sell-off has picked up steam over the... [+] last month.The latest downturn follows a report of Bloomberg analysis of technical data that suggests the bitcoin price could be heading into a ""negative pattern.""The Average Directional Index (ADX) a technical indicator that rises as negative selling trends strengthen, is at its highest level since July, Bloomberg reported. The ADX is currently around 47 and if it crosses 50 it will be the first time it does so this year in a negative pattern, according to Bloomberg.""There’s little to prevent fading Bitcoin prices from reaching the continuous mean of $1,500,"" wrote Bloomberg analyst Mike McGlone in a note, indicating a drop of 60% from bitcoin's current price.The bitcoin sell-off, which has been labeled crypto winter, was sparked by a so-called hard fork in the bitcoin cash cryptocurrency after developers and miners failed to agree on updates to the coin's network.The bitcoin price appeared be rebounding yesterday before taking a dive today.The ensuing computer power war, which turned nasty as the two camps struggled for control of the bitcoin rival, resulted in many cashing out of the bitcoin and cryptocurrency holdings, afraid major holders could be about to abandon their positions to hurt one another.""We’re at a classic psychological stage where the market is reversing the 2017 frenzy,"" said McGlone in an interview with the newswire's TV station. ""The hard fork was a key trigger that signaled the technology is way too nascent. You had these dicey characters threatening to destroy each other and institutions said 'It might be best if we stay away from this for a while.'""After months of relative stability, bitcoin volatility exploded in November, with bitcoin recording its steepest monthly plunge in seven years and sparking speculation the bitcoin experiment could be coming to an end.Adding to bitcoin's woes the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has cracked down on the crypto space, in recent weeks, fining two companies last month that hadn’t registered their initial coin offerings as securities.Last week, the head of the SEC said that concern over a lack of investor protections means he is minded not to approve a closely-watched bitcoin exchange-traded fund application. A decision from the SEC is expected at the end of December.Elsewhere, other major cryptocurrencies also took a beating. Ripple, the informal name for the XRP token, is down some 5% over the last 24 hours, while ethereum is off by almost 9% and stellar is down 10%.Bitcoin cash, which was the subject of a hard fork and hash war last month, led the sell-off today.Meanwhile, Miami-based blockchain and telecoms company UnitedCorp has launched a lawsuit against bitcoin mining company Bitmain, website bitcoin.com, Roger Ver, who runs the bitcoin.com website, and the Kraken bitcoin exchange over what it calls a ""scheme"" to take control of bitcoin cash for ""personal gain.""UnitedCorp is arguing the group colluded to ""effectively hijack"" the bitcoin cash network after the November software update with the intent of centralizing the network."

Offerings ...","Nov 27, 2018,06:20pm EST",What's behind the latest Bitcoin crash?,"Bitcoin’s USD value continued to fall this week leading to the cryptocurrency’s value dropping below $5,000 for the first time in 13 months. Bitcoin saw a fall of 14% in a 24 hour period last week, which could be down in part to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s sanctions on two crypto startups that it ruled were offering ICOs. Other major cryptocurrencies have also experienced a significant fall in value, including ethereum, bitcoin cash, and litecoin.Initial Coin Offerings rulingThe first potential cause for the widespread sudden fall in value for cryptocurrencies is the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s decision to classify ICOs as unlicensed securities, meaning that those offering such assets were breaking the law and must pay fines as well as restitution.While some are arguing that the SEC’s intervention is long overdue, the commission had been taking a back seat in terms of overseeing and enforcing regulation within the crypto market until now. However, the decision has certainly made some industry insiders question the viability of the market in this period of uncertain regulation. The decision by the SEC will not come as a surprise to many, but it may well have been enough to spook some investors who could sit tight on crypto until clearer regulations are outlined by not only the U.S. government but lawmakers across the globe also.Bitcoin Cash ForkBut the unrest could have come from loyal investors in Bitcoin, torn between two coins. On the one hand is Bitcoin Cash ABC while backing the other, Bitcoin Cash SV, is the (self-professed) Satoshi Nakamoto himself Craig Wright. This fork is the divisive element cryptocurrency could do without.Developers of Bitcoin ABC included a so-called checkpoint that forces miners to include the first Bitcoin Cash ABC block in any chain, without it the chain is considered invalid by the software client. There are other software options for users, and they can opt out of the checkpointed version, but it opens the risk of another split taking place between a checkpointed Bitcoin Cash ABC and a non-checkpointed Bitcoin Cash ABC.This latest fork renewed fears that Bitcoin Cash would become centralized, and said fears are thought to be at the heart of the fall in the value of Bitcoin Cash.However, it is not the first fork for the cryptocurrency, and the changes that took place in the past were also steeped in controversy but did not cause the type of fall in value observed this time. On the drop, Jehan Chu, Co-Founder & Managing Partner at Kenetic.Capital commented: ""Bitcoin’s previously solid price anchor was unmoored by the recent Bitcoin Cash fork and is unlikely to recover anytime soon. Craig Wright’s antics have exposed the fragile relationship between decentralized technology and the outsize influence their figureheads wield. Until blockchain technology proves more useful than the people behind it, price levels are unlikely to remain sustainably high.""Nvidia and Advanced Micro DevicesThe third potential contributing factor to the sudden drop in value is the disappointing results announced by chip-makers Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, both of which are leading suppliers of hardware for cryptocurrency miners. The decline in sales has been seen as an indicator of a fall in levels of interest in crypto mining. The biggest question surrounding this is whether miners caught wind of the upcoming crash and stopped investing in hardware, or if the decline in hardware sales caused investors to question the long-term interest in cryptocurrency mining. Nvidia’s share prices fell to a 16-month low following the announcement of the dramatic fall in sales and the cryptocurrency crash. It remains unclear if the fall in chip makers’ sales is a symptom or a cause of the crash, but there is a definite correlation between both significant events in the cryptocurrency market.Market insiders’ opinionIndustry experts have gathered together to analyze the recent fall in cryptocurrency value. The crash has been widely attributed to the Bitcoin Cash fork, but some also believe it could be due to an inevitable bubble burst that has come after a period of unsustainable growth.Crypto YouTube star Quinten François of the Young & Investing channel said:Market makers are finishing the cycle. Currently we are sitting under ""the mean"" or fair value of Bitcoin, which means that we are in the last bearish phase of the cycle called “despair”. After that we should see a market reversal and start a new cycle. How far we will fall is still a question, but a fact is that when Bitcoin would fall to $5,000 it would have lost 75% of its value top to bottom. That seems to be fair considering that a market loses less value every other cycle in the process of becoming mature. Last cycle Bitcoin lost 87% top to bottom (2014), but that was an entirely different market environment and industry.""Michael Jeoung, CEO of Trustverse also believes the fork is in part responsible, saying:Crypto Civil War erupted from Bitcoin cash hard folk between ABC and SV (Satoshi Vision) has been one of the cause for the deep impact for the crypto market melt down and many investors are suffering from the incident. More importantly, this battle between ABC (Jihan Woo) vs. SV (Craig Wright), has no consensus from the public nor the DAU of Bitcoin Cash token holders and this makes it serious from the ethical point of view. It is centralized and monopolized power game, where blockchain is meant to become a public, decentralized trust mechanism. Price manipulation by power game is hurting digital wealth as well as it’s future value for technology development.First of all, wasn’t blockchain more about sharability and shared economy? More and more I feel from this industry is that many things are manipulated, information asymmetry exists larger than the modern financial market, and moreover such incident really has impacted mistrust for many entities. No product or services that ignore right or customer satisfaction fails and this civil war really implies self-interest than public’s interest. Overall cryptocurrency transactions seem to be shorted and slowing down for now. My hopeful view is that the fundamental market has not been changed.""All things considered, there will be enough people out there making use of the BCH capitulation to drive prices down across the space in what some are calling a technical move. And if the Hash war has not ended then this could cause an influx of cash, and might give way to either a price stabilization or a momentum. Either way, there could be a further drop before the currency starts to make gains."

I should add that normally these matters take a lot longer than I anticipate but timing remains the nearly impossible skill we all wish we had.I’m still holding out for $2,500.[Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.]This was the set up, I wrote about here at the beginning of October.I said this uncanny tightening of range would lead to a big break out to the high or low and that whichever direction would be a signal and the trade was to jump on that trend:The tightening range in the bitcoin priceThis is the chart I drew you in the summer of target levels to the downside:My predicted target levels for bitcoinSo here we are today and I must say bitcoin stuck at the $5,500 level for a lot longer than I expected:What actually happened to the bitcoin priceI’m still hoping for a buying opportunity at around $2,500 and while I really don’t expect to see $1,000, it could happen.So much for yesterday, what about tomorrow?The call you have to make is, does the current generation of cryptocurrencies--not tokens, but bitcoin-style minable, distributed, trustless coins--have a future or not. If they don’t, then they will go to zero, if they do then they will ultimately go to the much-promised moon.I believe the latter although it must be said that a lot of countries are slowly but surely outlawing many aspects of them. However, I think that like the internet, cryptocurrencies cannot be erased even in near-totalitarian states. As such, the limited supply, big brands like bitcoin will recover like the denizens of the dotcom crash and ascend to great heights.For me this crash is a buying opportunity, it’s just a matter of timing it as best we can.I have been buying since the initial crash at about $5,000 but only tiny amounts, but I will start buying properly below $4,000, then more below $3,000 and finally I may decide to do a splurge at around $1,000 but at that level even my faith will be quavering a little.While it might seem I’m a pretty good predictor of the market prices I prefer to play the markets as a zone of probabilities. Probabilities are that bitcoin will see $100,000 a coin one day but fall further before it sees a bottom. Steadily acquiring coins is good, but getting coins cheaper is better.Most traders can’t abide that kind of woolly thinking, but I feel we have a woolly sense of the future so we should buy and sell in a woolly hesitant fashion to get the sort of solid average we want. Buy around the bottom, sell around the top is the best anyone can do.Market predictions are not fate.So what now?I think crypto will continue to fall. There might be a period of sideways trading at these levels, but another drop should develop.A dramatic rally is possible but that should be telegraphed by a bump in general altcoin fiat mining rewards and there are none in sight at the moment.Like the precious metal stackers, I’m slowly staking bitcoin and that pace will quicken as it falls.So you can imagine I’m keen for more bear market moves and I’m eagerly awaiting them.I may never get my $2,500 bottom because other altcoins are already close or at what looks like theirs.Take ethereum, which I predicted at the beginning of October would see $100 a coin here.My prediction for ethereumIt is now here:What actually happened to the ethereum priceThat is just a few hops away from a bottom.Yet is doesn’t do to overanalyze things.Crypto and equities are crashing because ‘fiat,’ old fashioned money, is being sucked out of the system by the Federal Reserve’s reverse-QE. To top that, the global order is suddenly wobbling on its axis with Trump’s ‘war on trade’ and the increasing ‘volatility’ of governance not just in the U.S. but around the globe.A new era is ahead, and it looks like it is going to get kicked off with a financial market reset.What to do?Buy the crash.But try not to ride too much of it down and don’t be in a hurry to get back in.Be among the first to know the most important crypto and blockchain news and information with Forbes Crypto Confidential, a free weekly eletter.

[+] future.""The unequivocal answer is [digital assets will survive],"" Sprecher said earlier this week at the Consensus: Invest conference in New York, it was first reported by CNBC. ""As an exchange operator, it’s not our objective to opine on prices.""Bitcoin has over the last two days climbed back over the psychological $4,000 mark after falling as low as $3,600 last week amid a rout that has wiped billions from the market capitalizations of the world's biggest cryptocurrencies, including the likes of Ripple's XRP and Ethereum's ether.The bitcoin price has fallen some 80% so far this year, with a sell-off this month sparked by rival cryptocurrency, bitcoin cash, splitting in two due to developers and miners failing to reach an agreement over its future.Sprecher, who is chief executive of the NYSE's parent company Intercontinental Exchange, has backed bitcoin and cryptocurrency platform Bakkt, which intends to offer bitcoin futures trading from early next year and open bitcoin and cryptocurrencies up to a wider retail market through partnerships with coffee shop chain Starbucks and PC giant Microsoft.As cryptocurrencies across the board fell this week, bitcoin's dominance (its share of the total cryptocurrency capitalization) has ticked up over the course of the month, from lows of 51% in early November to 53% today—highlighting bitcoin's enduring appeal to investors and cryptocurrency miners.The bitcoin price moved sharply lower this month after months of stagnation.""Somehow bitcoin has lived in a swamp and survived,"" Sprecher added. ""There are thousands of other tokens that you could argue are better but yet bitcoin continues to survive, thrive and attract attention.""Often times in finance, it’s not about being the best — it turns out to be about being the broadest and the most commonly accepted and for whatever reason bitcoin has become that.""Elsewhere, the head of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) earlier this week warned a much-anticipated bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) is ""unlikely"" any time soon, dealing a blow to those who hope a bitcoin ETF is going to trigger a bull run next year.If approved, a bitcoin ETF would mean people are able to buy into bitcoin without having to deal with clunky exchanges that often struggle with cumbersome regulation and lack of public trust.In August this year, the SEC rejected nine applications for a bitcoin ETF.Meanwhile, speaking at the same event as Sprecher, Kelly Loeffler, the chief executive officer of Bakkt who happens to married to the NYSE chairman, said: ""We’re creating that infrastructure that doesn’t exist today, which we think is a big opportunity for institutional investors to come in."""

Once the ones featuring me began to disappear, others started to appear. They're about a scam feeling warm and cuddly with a well-known and trust face,"" Lewis told this reporter.""People ask me if the products being advertised are any good but the ads are just a scam! There's nothing to them. People need to be very careful because some have lost life lost changing amounts of money.""It adds credibility to the scams being on these kinds of social media platforms.

Around $72 billion of unlawful activity per year involves Bitcoin, which is close to the scale of the U.S. and European markets for illegal drugs.Moreover, a 2018 study conducted by blockchain analysis startup, Elliptic, and the Center on Sanctions and Illicit Finance, found a fivefold increase in the number of large-scale illegal operations working on the Bitcoin blockchain between 2013 and 2016. By analyzing the history of more than 500,000 bitcoins, the organizations identified 102 criminal entities, which included dark-web marketplaces, ponzi schemes and ransomware/malware attackers.Tracing Criminal Activity Across The Bitcoin BlockchainInterestingly enough, many of the digital currencies examined in the study conducted by Elliptic and the Center on Sanctions and Illicit Finance could be linked back to the perpetrators. For example, it was found that 95% of all the laundered coins tracked came from nine dark-web marketplaces, including Silk Road, Silk Road 2.0, Agora and AlphaBay.By examining blockchain activity closely, companies focused on combating cryptocurrency related crimes can pinpoint accounts that appear to belong to the same Bitcoin wallet and are controlled by the same entity. This process is known as “clustering.”According to Kyrylo Chykhradze, head of Bitfury’s Crystal, a software solution designed to track activity on the Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash Blockchains, Crystal collects information about all the transactions recorded to the blockchain to determine which addresses belong to the same entity to identify criminal activities.Using a unique clustering algorithm, Crystal can determine which bitcoin address belongs to certain users. The solution also utilizes web crawlers and manual registration on various services to name the entities and assign them a risk score based on the type of service. Crystal, which has assisted financial institutions and law enforcement in identifying and tracing criminal activities such as extortion and money-laundering, assigns a risk score based on every bitcoin address that has ever appeared in the blockchain.”As financial institutions and law enforcement begin to use tools such as Crystal, organizations can start to easily detect illegal activities happening across blockchain networks.For instance, the Bitfury Group conducted a report to trace back the movement of Bitcoin from the Japanese-based Zaif exchange after it was hacked in September. Zaif lost $60 million in crypto, including almost 6,000 bitcoins.According to analysis completed by Bitfury’s Crystal Blockchain Analytics engineering team, 30% of the stolen Bitcoins are still located at addresses related to the hacker.  Another 24% were sent to Binance for exchange/withdrawal. The remaining 46% were split into small amounts and sent to various addresses. The addresses with unknown owners are still under surveillance using the Crystal Blockchain software solution. And because Zaif shared the exact time of unauthorized access, the Crystal engineering team was able to determine which transactions belonged to the hackers.Keeping The Crypto Community Safe OfflineIn addition to tracing threatening criminal activities across blockchain networks, cryptocrime has also been impacting the offline world. Recently, there have been a number of crimes occur in which victims were forced to hand over cryptocurrency account details, or else face violent consequences.Due to real-world attacks, BlockShow, a major flagship event for the blockchain industry, has announced a partnership with Bitfury to bring Crystal to its upcoming Singapore event, which is expected to attract over 3,000 attendees.Recently, a group or individual using fake identities made claims of planning to sabotage BlockShow Asia with explosives through its community Telegram channels. In addition to reporting the threats to police and increasing security at the event, BlockShow’s organizers wanted to give attendees an opportunity to acknowledge the risks that accompany the promise of bitcoin and to gain additional insight into their own vulnerability.All of our events are centered on a simple premise: we believe in the power of blockchain and cryptocurrencies. But we also believe in transparency and aren’t going to ignore the dangers that come with this promising new technology,” Addy Creaze, CEO of BlockShow said. “To some extent, the more promising a technology is, the more people want to sabotage it. We are looking forward to helping attendees understand and address some of crypto’s risks, as we also explore its undeniable potential.”All attendees at BlockShow Asia will have access to Crystal and will be able to scan the QR code of their crypto-wallets to obtain user’s risk scores. According to Chykhradze, a risk score represents the extent in which a bitcoin address is connected to questionable activity. This allows all Blockshow attendees to check whether or not their funds could arouse suspicion from authorities.Bitfury is proud to participate in BlockShow Asia to demonstrate our unique ‘risk score,' which relies on a database we've compiled of hundreds of organizations and thousands of individuals who own bitcoin addresses. Participation in Blockshow helps us to support the intentions of the organizers and Bitfury in drawing attention to important topics of crypto - such as trust, transparency and cybersecurity.”"

[+] photograph in London, U.K., on Tuesday, Feb. 6, 2018. Photographer: Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg","The cryptocurrency industry fell out of favor in November, with a sell-off across cryptocurrencies leading prices sharply lower over the latter half of the month. Notably, Bitcoin slumped from the level of $6,400 it had largely been around since June to well below $4,000 by the end of November. In fact, the popular cryptocurrency is currently trading at its lowest level since September 2017. This is primarily because investors had been following a buy-and-hold strategy over the last several months, as they remained hopeful of a big surge in price once the SEC clears Bitcoin ETFs. However, continued concerns about the lack of proper market surveillance and custody in the industry contributed to the sell-off. And with the SEC delaying its decision on a Bitcoin ETF further to February, it doesn’t look like Bitcoin prices will see a rally in the near term.However, we believe that investor concerns are overblown. The number of unique Bitcoin users has nudged higher in the last five months, and total Bitcoin transaction volumes also reversed the steady decline seen over August-October (albeit because of the sell-off). Using the current values for the number of Bitcoin users and transaction volume in our interactive Bitcoin Price Estimator shows that the fair value of the key cryptocurrency should be around $4,900 – a figure that is 25-30% above the current market price.The graphic below captures our base case forecast for the monthly average price of Bitcoin over the next six months based on our estimates for transaction volume and number of Bitcoin users, and also shows a possible price range for the cryptocurrency taking into account bullish and bearish outlooks for the period.What Drives The Price Of Bitcoin?Like the price for anything, Bitcoin’s fundamental price depends primarily on demand and supply. Demand for Bitcoin is primarily driven by two factors: the number of active users, and how much they transact. On the supply side, the number of available Bitcoins is capped, and about 80% of the capped number is already mined. As such, it is sensible to focus on the demand, both in terms of users and transaction volumes.This also makes sense given the fact that Bitcoin prices over the years have primarily been driven by the perception of how a particular piece of news boosts or hurts the potential number of Bitcoin users and their transaction volume in the long run. This has held true since Bitcoin was first introduced, barring the last few months of 2017 when the media euphoria surrounding cryptocurrencies drove Bitcoin prices to an all-time high of almost $20,000. Although Bitcoin prices are susceptible to extreme volatility, they have largely moved in tandem with news that signaled either increased adoption in the future – like Goldman’s original decision to set up a cryptocurrency trading desk, and IntercontinentalExchange’s ongoing work on a new trading platform that supports cryptocurrencies – or setbacks in terms of long-term adoption, like a cyber-attack on two South Korean Bitcoin exchanges in June, followed by the SEC rejecting several Bitcoin ETF plans.In our interactive Bitcoin Price Estimator, we forecast changes in the number of unique users as well as transaction volumes for each month through mid-2019 to arrive at our estimate for Bitcoin’s fundamental value. This video shows how to leverage our bitcoin pricing dashboard. While the dashboard looks fairly basic, in back-testing – a method to see how well it could have predicted prices in the past – it was almost 94% accurate.For several months now, investors have bet on a surge in Bitcoin prices due to the SEC’s approval of Bitcoin ETFs. This is because such a move would make Bitcoin a more mainstream investment option – and make it accessible to institutional (as well as many retail) investors. This, in turn, should boost the number of Bitcoin users and greatly increase transaction volumes in the cryptocurrency. As we detail above, these two factors directly drive the price of Bitcoin.Although the SEC rejected several proposals for Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year, it has softened its stance towards the industry in a series of steps over recent months. It is reviewing the proposals again, and also invited investor opinions about the pros and cons of a Bitcoin-linked ETF which could very well be the first Bitcoin ETF. However, investor optimism took a hit in late November from signs that the SEC will not green-light the Bitcoin ETF anytime soon – something that was confirmed earlier this week, with the SEC’s announcement to delay the decision further to February.The uncertainty surrounding Bitcoin’s future will understandably lead to a reduction in number of Bitcoin users over time until the SEC takes a call on Bitcoin ETFs. As we show in the chart below, the SEC’s action (or lack thereof) can make all the difference between Bitcoin’s price falling to just $2,000, or crossing $10,000 within a matter of months. The thick grey lines below represent the base case scenario, while the green and purple lines represent the upside and downside scenarios, respectively."

This has now fallen to just 18%. Bitcoin's dominance touched lows of 32% in January, with ethereum and Ripple's XRP its biggest rivals at 18% and 10% respectively.Meanwhile, despite bitcoin's massive sell-off, it would appear there is still some appetite for cryptocurrencies amongst institutional investors and the traditional financial services industry.Bitcoin price bull and renowned venture capital investor Tim Draper, who recently reaffirmed his prediction that the bitcoin price will reach a whopping $250,000 by 2022, has said he expects the entire global economy will eventually pivot to cryptocurrencies, with bitcoin leading the change.Draper, speaking to Mike Green of Thiel Macro on behalf of investor platform Real Vision on the sidelines of World Crypto Con in Las Vegas earlier this month, predicted that cryptocurrency will eventually make up two-thirds of all the world's currency value.The bitcoin price has fallen significantly this year, but not as deeply as some other major digital...

It wants to allow trading in the first quarter of 2019, Bloomberg reported.Many have previously pointed to institutional investors and the established financial industry's interest in bitcoin over other major cryptocurrencies (save for Ripple's XRP) as the reason for the alt coin sell-off so far this year."

Or there could be a dead cat bounce. Either way, I see bitcoin as a dead man walking. Future generations may read about bitcoin in a finance textbook as a curiosity and wonder what all the fuss was about. There are still some die-hard adherents espousing the virtues of bitcoin, desperate to make a silk purse out of a sow’s ear. Unfortunately for them, the end may not be pretty when it comes.Proponents of bitcoin tend to focus on the impact of the blockchain technology that drives it, and make no mistake, blockchain is the real deal. Blockchain is fundamentally changing the way industries do business, from traditional banking to supply chain management. But just because blockchain technology is creating a new paradigm doesn’t mean that bitcoin shares that same distinction. Television fundamentally changed the way the world received news and entertainment. However, it also gave us the likes of Manimal and My Mother the Car.For those who purchase bitcoin, there are serious headwinds that make it unlikely they will enjoy any profits over the long term. Most cryptocurrency transactions are purely speculative. There are no real fundamentals to evaluate; bitcoin doesn’t produce any products or services, hire any employees or pay any dividends. The only way profits are generated is when the owner is lucky enough to find someone else who will pay more for the thing. If you are getting into the bitcoin game now, you are paying the higher price that makes this whole scheme work. That’s not a distinction you want.Some bitcoin aficionados are attracted to the idea of a currency beyond government control, one that provides a store of value that easily crosses borders around the globe, and the comfort of anonymity it can provide. For many, it seems like the ultimate safe haven for their money in times of global uncertainty. But these characteristics have only persisted because governments have largely treated cryptocurrencies as novelties. The minute bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency appears to have even the slightest chance of disrupting national monetary supply, I expect regulation to be swift and decisive. The SEC has already issued guidance around cryptocurrencies that has created roadblocks to gaining the same legitimacy as traditional marketable securities.Cryptocurrencies themselves aren’t going away, and they will likely remain part of the financial landscape indefinitely. But there’s very little reason to believe that bitcoin will be the one that stands the test of time. Other than the name recognition it carries in the market, it’s virtually indistinguishable from any of the other cryptocurrencies. Someone came up with a cool name and way to mine it, and so it was born. At some point, the world may well decide that it doesn’t really need the 2,000 or so active currencies out there, and the market will devour itself. Do you think that being early to market or having “brand name” recognition will save it? I suggest you talk to anyone who had a MySpace page or carried a PalmPilot about how owning the space early worked out.If you think buying bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency is the key to your financial security, retirement or kid’s college education, you could be in for a rude awakening. If you enjoy the thrill of making bets, I suggest you visit your favorite sports book or table game in Vegas where your odds of success are much higher. If you think it’s a fun way to try to make a big score, you’ll probably have better luck throwing darts at microcap stocks. But if you’re doing it purely speculatively, and you’re prepared to lose all your money, keep doing what you’re doing."

This made the sentiment sour. The break of $6,000 was the first major psychological level to be broken and now a violation of the $5,000-mark is further evidence that the bulls are not supporting the price. The next big support level is at $4,000. One can only pray that the price doesn’t break below this critical level because this would open the floor towards the $3,000 level.The open interest for Bitcoin futures on CME group and CBOE exchanges has jumped to 22,266, hitting an all-time high. Open interest is by definition a measure of market activity, or simply put the flow of money into the futures market. Higher open interest means new money joining the market and lower open interest means fewer investors are interested in this market.Return of volatility for Bitcoin. Open interest has jumped to a record level.Fundamentally speaking, the current sell-off is due to two main reasons; regulatory pressure and disagreement within the coin developer community, one of the biggest threats.  The SEC reminded the crypto world that it has the final say over anything that smells like a security. The department issued civil penalties against two cryptocurrency companies because they failed to register initial coin offerings as securities. Investors will be given their refund and the firms will have to face fines. The fear is that the SEC may not stop here and might take similar action against several companies that adopted a similar path.The community needs to stick together and work towards a more meaningful fork. This is because developers, on the one hand, try to convince the world that the supply is limited and, on the other hand, they keep looking at ways of triggering another kind of forks.  Forking has become so common that it puts at risk the notion of limited supply altogether .Disclaimer: I hold Bitcoin in my wallet."

trillion- ...","Nov 28, 2018,10:03am EST","I recently had a discussion with Taotao He (Director of Alternative Assets) and Jorge Go (Advisor) at Marto Capital, about the recent volatility and future impact of the crypto market. Despite this year’s bloodbath in the crypto-asset space, the industry will likely still generate considerable investor surplus in the long-run. In fact, an investment in a basket of the top crypto-assets (largely Bitcoin) has the best chance to deliver the most attractive risk-adjusted returns over the next 10-years, compared to less controversial favorites such as Amazon stock, 10-year U.S. Treasuries, an apartment in Manhattan, or other “consensus longs”. While the bull thesis for crypto-assets is far more nuanced than can be covered in a short article, in our discussion, we outlined four of the most salient themes below.","Bitcoin price action (01/01/2017 - 11/27/2018)Bitcoin as a Macroeconomic Hedge and “Holy Grail” Portfolio AssetBitcoin is a rare, unlevered asset in a levered world. Global debt has reached $250 trillion ($70 trillion higher than in 2008); the U.S. runs a trillion-dollar deficit, pension funds are underfunded amidst retiring populations, and student debt has snowballed to $1.5+ trillion in the U.S. (with 9/10 borrowers struggling to make payments). All of this puts pressure on central banks to print excessively into the foreseeable future, diluting the value of fiat currency. Smart money (and increasingly, just more money), will flock to unlevered assets that have limited supply – gold, bitcoin, or other alternative assets that aren’t part of the mainstream investment world. Traditional assets such as equities, government / corporate bonds and real estate are all highly levered.Further, from a portfolio theory perspective, bitcoin is an asset that is non-correlated (volatile yes, but volatility that is unrelated to fiat investments) and therefore a true method of diversification that boosts the overall portfolio’s risk-reward (e.g. Sharpe, Sortino), and with plenty of upside that is premised on secular and defensible trends.Blockchain is Built on the Premise of Social ScalabilityThe story of humans is a story of networks - where throughout thousands of years of history, we’ve organized ourselves into networks which we use to get things done. Cooperation across boundaries has produced nations, businesses and other crucial institutions. But cooperation requires a protocol that sets the rules of cooperation, and that traditionally requires some gatekeeping entity to be in charge - because someone always cheats. That entity historically would be a king, an elite, a corporation, or a crowd. The problem is, if you put a king in charge, you pave the way for a tyrant; if you put an elite in charge, you create an unfair aristocracy; and if you put a corporation in charge, you get a rent-seeking monopoly. If you put a central bank in charge, it will manage money supply to optimize the health of its own currency and balance sheet, not to the benefit of the individual saver or investor. A misaligned central bank may be incentivized to protect itself by devaluing your savings.At the same time, we have open protocols in which participants of a network can inter-operate permissionlessly without a gatekeeper. The English language is an open protocol because it’s not owned by anybody (e.g. we don't need the government's approval to converse in English, or add a new word to the language). Parts of today’s internet are open protocols as well. Blockchains will allow open protocols in almost everything, where anyone can participate in all sorts of networks where no single entity is in charge. But unlike a pure democracy, these networks are not entirely flat - they are meritocracies. In the Bitcoin network, the more security you provide, the more bitcoin you’re paid, and the more say you have in the network's governance. In the Ethereum network, you get paid in ether to verify computations. Blockchain-enabled systems are merit-based, peer-to-peer marketplaces that allow humans to continue to form valuable, efficient networks without relying on legacy gatekeepers.Blockchain Technology Enables Financial Inclusion without Rent-Seeking IntermediariesAs a corollary to the last point, the technology now exists to have a financial network separate from the control of kings and central banks. Beyond this, crypto-assets also democratizes access to capital for financially neglected pockets of the world outside the Wall Street elite.Without going into the technicals, blockchain technology combines software engineering, economics, behavioral psychology, and other fields to create an open, permisionless and distributed ledger that anyone in the world can access and audit from anywhere. The four main benefits of blockchain include i) judgment/censorship resistance, ii) decentralization/broad points of failure, ii) immutability, and iv) perhaps most important, trustlessness. The most game-changing aspect of crypto-assets is that it allows for the automated programming of incentives; and if you can program incentives, you can start programming human behavior — and ultimately remove the need for a trusted third party (“TTP”).Take Bitcoin for instance. It is faster / cheaper to send, inherently deflationary, easier to store / divide and is a true non-correlated hedge. Unlike gold or the US dollar, it works on weekends, 24/7/365. It is judgment and censorship resistant — subject to no capital controls, bank restrictions, or asset freezes. It is trustless in that a TTP is not necessary to handle your assets, and in the sense that you do not have to trust a government to preserve value on your behalf (e.g. The Fed pumping trillions of dollars in the last recession to devalue the dollar, India decommissioning certain bills arbitrarily wiping out value, Venezuela’s hyperinflation).Crypto-assets’ Large Addressable Market Results In an Investment with Asymmetric UpsideBlockchain’s total addressable market (TAM) includes all the disruptable markets dominated by TTPs, from insurance to gambling / prediction markets, to virtual real estate. We think that could be at least a third of global GDP ($80 trillion), plus a non-trivial amount of Global Wealth ($300 trillion).If you buy the premise that BTC is better than gold (based on this article and related links above), perhaps the TAM in an ultimate bull case is global wealth, or around $400 trillion in 10 years. Imprecisely, if BTC takes just 2% of this TAM, it would have an $8 trillion cap, vs. the ~$150 billion it is now. If you have something that can potentially 50x, you must have 98% conviction that it’s not going to happen for you to not put money in.Oftentimes, people look at investing in crypto-assets as this binary concept — do I invest given the asymmetric upside, or do I not invest because it’s vaporware that could go to zero? This is a false dilemma. The reconciler is simply a matter of sizing. One must ask themselves, is it worth putting a dollar into the space? The answer is undoubtedly “yes.” How about two dollars, three, four — and you go from there. We believe every well-balanced portfolio includes a crypto-asset allocation — and the only question is one of sizing."

In terms of market capitalization, that is.","That’s according to a recently published A.T. Kearney report. “By the end of 2019, Bitcoin will reclaim nearly two-thirds of the crypto-market capitalization as altcoins lose their luster because of growing risk aversion among cryptocurrency investors,’ says the report.  “More broadly financial regulators will soften their stance towards the sector.”Then there is the growing complexity of altcoins. “Our prediction that Bitcoin will regain its dominance is supported by the ever-growing complexity among altcoins, most recently demonstrated by the “hash war” that occurred in the Bitcoin Cash ecosystem,” explains   Courtney Rickert McCaffrey manager of thought leadership in A.T. Kearney s Global Business Policy Council. “Additional “hard forks” and the continued lack of consensus among developers about a path forward will further widen the chasm between Bitcoin as the most accessible and widely recognized cryptocurrency and the altcoin community.”That doesn’t mean that all altcoins will go away. “Some survive and grow up to be explosive enterprises, that have real products and generate real and substantial revenues. altcoin will follow somewhat that same pattern,” Steve Russo, Executive VP Eclypses. “Those that are whimsical and have no real value will vaporize, while the real ones will not only survive, but thrive over time. “Bitcoin had a bad year in 2018. The digital currency lost 73% of its value, dragging down the entire cryptocurrency market.Bitcoin Price YTDThere are several reasons for that. Like the proliferation of altcoins, which expanded the “horizontal” supply of cryptocurrencies.Then there’s the lack of transparency in Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs).  It has turned the cryptocurrency markets into a modern day “wild west,” scaring investors away.And there are the persistently low adoption rates. In spite of the buzz generated in social media, Bitcoin adoption has been growing slowly, as evidenced by a recent Gallup survey.This means that Bitcoin remains an exotic currency for the “innovators” and the “early adaptors,” yet to reach the “mass majority.” That’s when a new product crosses the “tipping point,” according to marketers.But there’s one more reason behind the decline in Bitcoin’s value in 2018  -- rising interest rates. They cooled-off speculation across all markets.Still, things can turn around for 2019. A softer regulatory stance could pave the way for the long-awaited launching of Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) and could allow a broader investor participation and give a boost to the digital currency.That’s “ironic,” according to the A.T. Kearney report. “Ironically, for cryptocurrencies to see a third decade, the only viable path forward involves this acceptance by the international financial system that Bitcoin once sought to defeat.”Meanwhile, a pause in interest rate hikes could bring back investors to the Bitcoin market.That’s what Bitcoin bulls need after a dismal 2018.[Ed. note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated.

Soon after, it crossed the $5700-mark, another “floor” according to some experts.And eventually, the $5000-mark.That’s a round number that could also be considered a “floor” for the digital currency by those who follow market charts closely.All in all, Bitcoin is down close to 30% in just seven days, and close to 80% over a twelve month period.Bitcoin USDWhat’s driving the sell-off? Chebotaev, CEO of Betmatch, blames the threat of the “hash war.” “I think the hash war will continue to cause a bit of havoc with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, but now is the time to buy Bitcoin, and we need to give Bitcoin a chance to bounce, because it will rise again.”Patrick Palacios, CEO and founder of LoyalCoin, blames several factors. “The Bitcoin sell off is a combination of everything, The BCH Hard Fork, trader groups pumping and dumping, lack of regulation, THE OKEx allegations of market manipulation, all leading to very emotional trading,” he says. “Couple that with Nouriel Roubini’s Mr. Doom talk and you have a very unstable situation, which will take a few weeks to stabilize.”How “few” is a few weeks is hard to say. But based on the digital currency’s history, its price can be all over the map for weeks or even months before it reaches a new stable price.That’s usually the “intrinsic” or “fair” value. What that would be depends on the econometric model applied to estimate the digital currency’s “intrinsic” value.On the one side is Wheatley’s Model, which estimates the intrinsic value of Bitcoin by looking at the demand side of the price equation. It places Bitcoin’s value well below its current price, at $1,242.64.On the other side is Hayes Model, which estimates Bitcoin’s intrinsic value by looking at the supply side of the price equation. It places Bitcoin’s value at $10,179.25.Then there’s the Market Model, which looks at both the demand and supply side of the price equation. It places Bitcoin’s value very close to Hayes Model estimate, at $10,845.77.“These three intrinsic valuations provide interesting insights,” says Greg Giordano, who ran the simulations of the three models after the recent Bitcoin declines. “First off, this is one of the first times the Market Model has ever risen above Hayes' model. The reason for this is that mining revenue has fallen; however, transactions/block and unique addresses have actually increased, while mining difficulty has stayed steady. It is very interesting to see more users actually creating accounts for Bitcoin in such a bearish environment. Along with this, the amount of resources being put toward mining has not dropped off at all.”While, it’s unclear which of the three models will eventually turn out to be right, one thing is clear: volatility in cryptocurrency markets will continue.[Ed. note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated.

(Photo by: Andia/UIG via Getty Images)The removal of electricity subsidies for bitcoin miners in Norway will add further pressure on to the burgeoning industry, which has seen its profits heavily hit by the recent bitcoin and cryptocurrency rout and resulted in reports of many smaller bitcoin miners around the world switching off their machines.The average cost of bitcoin mining in Norway is $7,700 per coin, according to research from Germany-based bitcoin miner Northern Bitcoin, which has operations in Norway. It claims to be able to mine bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies) at a discount through use of cheap renewable energy and fjord-based cooling systems.""Norway can not continue to provide huge tax incentives for the most dirty form of cryptographic output as bitcoin. It requires a lot of energy and generates large greenhouse gas emissions globally,"" Norwegian parliamentary representative Lars Haltbrekken said recently, it was reported by Norwegian newspaper Aftenposten.After a stable few months, the bitcoin price moved sharply downward over the last week.Bitcoin miners and data centers in Norway currently enjoy the same discount as other power-intensive industries, meaning those with a capacity of more than 0.5 megawatts pay 0.48 krone ($0.05) per kilowatt. This will rise to 0.48 krone per kilowatt from January.Northern Bitcoin, which uses the Lefdal mine in Norway's Sandane to house its bitcoin mining rigs, found China has the lowest average bitcoin mining cost at $3,100, along with Saudi Arabia. In Canada, the average cost of bitcoin mining is almost $4,000.

Norway scores high on rankings of political stability and predictable framework conditions, but now the government is gambling with this credibility.""Others in the world of crypto and blockchain have welcomed the removal of subsidies, however.""This is a win for the Norwegian people and our natural resources,"" said Jon Ramvi, chief executive of Oslo-based blockchain advisory group Blockchangers. ""Less mining in Norway will reduce the prices of electricity for companies and people residing in Norway meaning that we reap the benefits of these resources locally instead of giving it away to Bitcoin miners.""More miners in the Bitcoin network does not make it faster or scale better. The only function of more miners is securing the network further. It means that if you want to hack the network, you will need to have more computational power than the other machines in the network. However, the Bitcoin network has been extremely secure for over a year now so there should be no need for more miners."""

A fork of a cryptocurrency takes place when someone, anyone declares that a blockchain is going to be transferred to a new set of rules and network infrastructure.The blockchain is a public ownerless database information, mostly transaction data, and anyone can get a copy of it and load it into their own system. The new system, which is likely a hacked about about version of the original code running the established crypto, is the new fork, it could be called Clem coin, bitcoin dung, utrillium (actually not a bad name for a new coin) or whatever. The fork then takes on a life of its own.[Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.]Bitcoin cash was a fork brought into existence to scale bitcoin-style transactions by having bigger blocks. These bigger blocks can contain more transactions and therefore allow a lot more business to flow through the system. Bitcoin’s system can get congested and fees can skyrocket and the time it takes for coins to go from one person to another can rise steeply. The bitcoin cash fork was to create a new crypto coin mostly like bitcoin that would not suffer from this.As a factor of the immaturity of the cryptocurrency industry nothing happens without an uproar and the launch of bitcoin cash was no exception. What happened next, however, was at the time unique.As a fork of this kind takes another coin’s existing blockchain, all the owners of coins in the old chain get the same coin in the new coin. That meant that bitcoin owners automatically got coins in bitcoin cash. Most imagined this would be the same as a spinoff of a company. Companies spin out new listed companies all the time.So image a stock, one that has a bank and an insurance company as its businesses. The company decides to fork itself into two companies. Shareholders will get new shares in a new company that has the bank injected in it and will keep the share in the old one. The share price falls in the old company as much as the new share trades at. That way no or little money is magicked out of thin air from the get go.We may have learned by now this is not how crypto works. When the fork came out, bitcoin did not fall and bitcoin cash went through the roof rising from the low hundreds to shoot quickly above $1,000. It was free money for bitcoin holders who could get their hands on their bitcoin cash by navigating the technical issues, which were mighty. I sold mine on day one in the $800s, marvelling at the windfall and the reverse logic of blockchain.You can make all sorts of arguments for why this money from nowhere event occurred but the simplest is, it took place in one of the biggest market bull runs in recent history, the bitcoin bubble. We could drill down into that but who needs an autopsy.Now bitcoin cash has forked itself with two opposing parties throwing millions of dollars to try to establish their master plan for bitcoin cash as the future or at least main future of that blockchain.It is very colorfully reminiscent of tech in the 1980s where upstart-company CEOs couldn’t resist insulting each other on their way to bankruptcy or zillionaire status.This though is a distraction. How do we make money from this in a bear market for crypto, the so called ‘Crypto Winter?’First and foremost, you need to decide if bitcoin etc. is going to $0 or $hero.If you don’t know don’t play.Personally, I’m sold on blockchain and virtual currencies opening a new chapter for global economics, so I’m just plotting my course to try and optimize my upside while minimizing my downside.If you want evidence as to why blockchain is not a flash in the pan, consider the incredible mainstream interest in bitcoin and its ilk in comparison to your average $200 billion stock. U.S. stocks, at least for now, have a $25 trillion market cap yet bitcoin trumps both Nasdaq and NYSE on Google search. This audience is what makes markets and crypto is a monster.Google Trends shows interest in BitcoinSo what to do with bitcoin cash?In a nutshell, wait for the dust to clear then buy some coins in the main winning fork. It’s likely to be bitcoin cash ABC, but the other fork, bitcoin cash SV, could win out--but don’t bother caring. Let the dust settle and when everyone’s forgotten about the mess, grab some.It’s not a clever strategy, but it should turn out smart. Crypto is a primitive market strewn with the most massive inefficiencies. As such you don’t need to deal in market nuances in the same way as you must in stocks.Crypto is in a bear market, bitcoin cash forks fighting for dominance will hurt bitcoin cash’s value. Once these two are out of the way the coin will flourish and that will mean a price rise.The thing to remember: markets crash in Ws. So buy the last leg, not the first crash down or the dead cat bounce, but the aftermath when everyone is crying over their losses.When you read the headline ‘Bitcoin Cash Is Dead’, and the more mainstream the media headline the better, wait a few days, then start to buy. The same will go for bitcoin too.But let it settle, markets take much longer to recover than fall.Be among the first to know the most important crypto and blockchain news and information with Forbes Crypto Confidential, a free weekly eletter.

[+] to its all-time highs.The bitcoin investing firm has branded the challenge “Buffett Bet 2.0"" in reference to the legendary investor Warren Buffett’s famous $1 million bet that the S&P 500 would outperform a selection of hedge funds over 10 years. Buffett was proven right last year, a decade on from the wager.Morgan Creek partners are personally funding their side of the bet and won't be using cash from the fund, though have not put in place any guarantees they will follow through with the bet if they can find a taker. Pompliano has reportedly said the plan is for the proceeds of the wager to be donated to charity, no matter which side wins.Morgan Creek is betting on bitcoin amid one of the cryptocurrency's worst ever sell-offs, a rout that has hit the wider market and been labeled ""crypto winter.""The bitcoin price today fell to its lowest this year, losing 5% over the last 24 hours and taking it to $3,560—a far cry from the near $20,000 it was 12 months ago. The bitcoin price peaked late last year after an epic bull run.""This is a combination of our outlook not only for the upside of cryptocurrencies but also the outlook on public equities,"" Pompliano told CNBC. ""A lot of people might look at this and just think we're bullish on crypto—but you need to look at what asset we’re going up against. Public equities aren’t exactly at their all-time highs either.""U.S. stocks have been falling recently as the oil price sinks and concerns over global growth mount.

While the prices soared last year, hitting monumental highs, recently the Bitcoin price fell to the lowest it's ever been - $5,165 – the lowest price since Oct. 18, 2017. Many have been wary about investing in the crypto market specifically because of these unpredictable price swings. The future is unseeable, and you’re unsure what tomorrow holds. The ever changing “mood” of the crypto market has caused many large corporations to stand by the wayside - hesitant to invest in a project that has more foreseeable risks than benefits. But the real reason that we are still hearing about blockchain technology constantly, and will continue to in the future, is simply because blockchain is not planning to going anywhere. With the token market in question, hardcore crypto enthusiasts turn to blockchain to save their hopes of a decentralized world, and they’re not alone. In the past few months, we’ve seen major companies and VC funds joining in, investing into blockchain and the promises it holds of security, transparency, and efficiency. In fact, in Fortune’s list of the best investing advice for 2019, experts include blockchain alongside robotics and AI as some of the biggest technological changes we’ll see coming to the largest companies in the next few years. Big corporate names including Facebook, Google, IBM, and Microsoft have been open about their research and experimentation with blockchain technology. And while it took some time for these companies to come around to the idea of blockchain, there’s a lot at stake. The global market for blockchain related products and services is already valued at $700 million, and will continue to rise, and is expected to exceed $60 billion by 2024. So whether these companies are finally coming to play because they are threatened by the new technological giant or because they really want to utilize for a variety of issues such as global transaction speed and payment processing, their entrance into the blockchain world cannot be ignored. Just last week the SEC announced that it is cracking down on regulatory abuses and outright fraud in the industry, giving companies more assurance that the blockchain companies they invest in are legitimate.Just recently, a blockchain startup has completed a funding round from ventures such as Sequoia (China). AERGO has raised 30 million dollars to act as a high-scale hybrid blockchain. The company was founded by Blocko, one of Korea's largest blockchain providers, which is backed by giants such as Samsung.Blocko is also collaborating with another giant, Hyundai, to create a document management system for enterprise companies.Another example of corporates partnering with blockchain these days, is Air France-KLM, Air Canada, Lufthansa, and Air New Zealand partnering with Winding Tree to try and innovate in an old-fashioned, and some might even say antiquated industry.While  countless other blockchain companies are bridging the gap between the modern and the traditional, by inviting large corporations to play in the blockchain playground, only time will if the old and the new can play together. There’s no doubt that blockchain technology is here to stay, but the question remains as to just how quickly the mass adoption of it will take. The internet in the form of the World Wide Web was debuted in the early 1990s, long before mainstream adoption which arguable didn’t occur years later with the invention of social media sites. Just like the internet at the time, little is known about blockchain technology, and we still have a lot to learn about the possibilities it will eventually offer us.  "

Stellar has been supported this year by speculation that it could be listed on U.S. exchange and wallet provider Coinbase.In July the exchange said it was considering listing stellar, as well as a number of other digital tokens.The bitcoin cash hard fork was blamed last week for sparking the wider cryptocurrency sell-0ff, wiping billions from the value of bitcoin, ripple (XRP), and ethereum, and leading to many analysts and groups decrying the chaotic nature of cryptocurrencies and their unsuitability as a currency and a store of value.The bitcoin cash hard fork, a consequence of the coin's developers and miners being unable to agree on a direction to take the cryptocurrency, resulted in the creation of bitcoin ABC and bitcoin SV.The two continue to battle it out for dominance, waging what's known as a hash war, as each tries to gain the upper hand in computing power and take control of the bitcoin cash network.Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies are falling sharply, with bitcoin cash leading the field...

Stages are price ranges when the asset stops and maintains a level of stability before they reprice again to another level. Many markets do this on the way up as well  as down. Once a market has stabilized, the next break away from that range is highly likely to produce a sizeable move. For a trader this offers a market neutral signal that can be jumped on, long or short.It is not a new phenomena or rocket science. Markets are consensus-seeking devices in the short term and that consensus is revealed in charts and gives a clear view of the past. The less efficient and perfect a market is, the more charts give a hint of the future and in my mind crypto is a very immature market filled with inefficiencies and imperfections. As such, charts of price action in bitcoin and other coins and tokens are a good tool in the alchemy of guessing what is going to unfold in this exciting and dangerous market.So bitcoin looks to be breaking south for the next leg down. Forgive me for making such brave unhedged calls; I can’t be right all the time but as far as I’m concerned it’s highly likely we are about to drop quickly towards my $2,500 target.Here is the chart as I write:The bitcoin chart shows the start of another dropIt is a high probability that this harmless-looking spike down is the start of another drop.Let’s look closer:A closer look at the bitcoin chartYou can see volatility has exploded at the current level, a sign of increased uncertainty and a generally bearish state, but you can also see today’s action suggesting a drop out of this recent trend.

This ratio will eventually switch, according to Draper, due to bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies being cheaper to operate and frictionless.Draper predicted that it won't be long before that balance of cryptocurrencies to fiat currency becomes 50-50 and that ""soon it will be easier to spend and invest your bitcoin than it is to spend and invest your dollars.""The bitcoin price has plummeted in the last few weeks, topping off a year that has seen the price...

(Photo by Jordan Mansfield/Getty Images)The bitcoin price falls over the weekend do not appear to be linked to any particular fresh news but a continuation of the sell-off sparked earlier this month by the fork of the bitcoin cash cryptocurrency that ignited a civil war between the bitcoin rival's two factions.Low trading volumes over the holiday weekend, however, mean the market is more vulnerable to so-called ""whales"" moving large amounts of bitcoin, ripple (XRP), or ethereum. When a major coin holder sells it can trigger automatic computer controlled sell orders leading to sudden sell-offs.Bitcoin's 24-hour trading volume fell under $4 billion for the first time on Saturday evening, the first time bitcoin trading volumes fell under $4 billion since November last year, according to CoinMarketCap, a cryptocurrency database.Ripple, the common name for the XRP digital token, has held up better than most over November's sell-off, boosted by deals it continues to ink with the traditional financial services industry to provider cheap and speedy cross-border transactions.Ripple (XRP) has however recorded significant falls over the weekend, though has led the rally this morning, popping 10% higher.Despite many bitcoin faithful arguing bitcoin is merely on discount for Cyber Monday today ahead of a so-called Santa rally (which traditionally sees stocks around the world move high in the run-up to Christmas), others are losing faith in the future of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies as this year's $700 billion rout tightens its grip.Many had hoped the bitcoin price had found a floor last week at over $4,000.Some think the latest bitcoin price plunge will be short-lived and can be remedied with increased institutional involvement and regulatory oversight of the cryptocurrency space.""Bitcoin's latest plunge is evidence of the need for greater regulatory oversight to give a boost to investor confidence,"" said Herbert Sim, the chief commercial officer at Cryptology, a cryptocurrency exchange based in Singapore. ""There is already a huge amount of capital tied up in cryptocurrencies, in excess of $100 billion, so why allow it to continue being a rogue market?""In order for the space to move forward and investor confidence to settle, regulators need to put standards in place to separate the weeds from the roses in the cryptocurrency world. Having oversight of the cryptocurrency Wild West will legitimize, and subsequently stabilize the industry, which will allow it to reach the next step of maturity.""""There’s still a lot of people in this game,"" Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia Pacific at Oanda, told Bloomberg last week.

There are different use cases all over the world,"" Singh told Bloomberg. ""If these traditional incumbents launch their products as expected you'd see a price of maybe around $15,000 to $20,000 [per bitcoin] by the end of next year, but that depends when these products are launched because nothing moves fast in fintech."""

In October, the UK's oldest bitcoin exchange Coinfloor axed around 40 employees.Bitcoin and cryptocurrency miners have also been forced to desperate measures to keep the computers running, cutting costs to the bone.Others have remained upbeat, however. Bitcoin miner Argo Blockchain, a UK-listed company, yesterday sought to soothe shareholder unrest, telling the market demand for its products and services has remained robust despite the downturn. The bitcoin price has gotten off to a bad start in December after many had hoped the worst was behind it, with the cryptocurrency market recording its steepest monthly declines in years last month.Bitcoin moved sharply downward at the beginning of this week as it gave up the psychological $4,000 level that had appeared to support the price over the last week.The bitcoin price has come under renewed pressure this week.Bitcoin dropped as low as $3,790, according to CoinDesk's bitcoin price tracker, back to near its yearly lows at the end of last month—and renewing fears the rout that began in November will bleed through to December."

But if you owe taxes, how about paying them in Bitcoin? Selling now may trigger tax losses to use next year too. In Ohio, you can now make state tax payments in Bitcoin. It's only for Bitcoin at present, but the permitted crypto should expand according to OhioCrypto.com. Ohio beat out Arizona, Georgia, Utah and New Hampshire, where efforts to accept crypto for taxes failed. The transaction fee is zero during an initial three-month introductory period, and then 1% thereafter. Even if you owe taxes to Ohio, that does not necessarily mean you qualify. So far, this is just for businesses operating in Ohio. If you operate a business in Ohio and have a tax bill, you can register at OhioCrypto.com. All payments are processed by third-party processor, BitPay. Payments are converted to dollars before deposit into a state account. ","Ethereum, Bitcoin and Ripple coins (physical). (Photo by Ulrich Baumgarten via Getty Images)Payment Protocol-compatible wallets include BitPay Wallet; Copay Wallet; BTC.com Wallet; Mycelium Wallet; Edge Wallet; Electrum Wallet; Bitcoin Core Wallet; Bitcoin.com Wallet; BRD Wallet; and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Wallets. If you don’t have one, OhioCrypto.com says you can create one. Remember, the IRS ruled that cryptocurrency is property in Notice 2014-21. That classification as property has some big tax consequences, accentuated by wild price swings.  If you owe $5,000 in taxes, you could pay the $5,000 in dollars. If you pay with $5,000 worth of Bitcoin, as long as the crypto is worth $5,000 when you pay, you’re home free, right? Not really. You need to consider the sale you just made. The transfer of the crypto to the tax man is a sale, and that could mean more taxes for the year of the payment. If you bought the crypto for $5,000 the day you pay your taxes, there’s no gain.But suppose you bought the crypto a year ago for $1,000 and it’s worth $5,000 when you use it to pay taxes? That’s right, you have a $4,000 gain. Hopefully, it is a long-term capital gain, which would make the taxes lower. But you still have taxes to pay—because of your tax payment. You could trigger a tax loss too, if you had bought the crypto for $7,000 and transfer it for taxes when it is worth $5,000. All sorts of transfers can trigger taxes. For example, payments using virtual currency made to independent contractors are taxable transactions to both parties. The recipient has income measured by the market value at the time of receipt.What’s more, as with other payments to independent contractors, payers engaged in a business must issue IRS Forms 1099. You can’t enter “1,000 Bitcoin” on IRS Forms 1099. You must value the payment in dollars, as of the time of payment. A payment made using virtual currency is subject to Form 1099 reporting just like any other payment made in property. The person paying the independent contractor with crypto just sold it. Whether that triggers a gain or loss depends on the payor's tax basis. The gain might be capital or ordinary. If you hold it for more than a year, the best deal is long-term capital gain treatment.But actually, gain or loss depends on whether the virtual currency is a capital asset in your hands. Most people can probably say they are investors in crypto, not a dealer or someone using it in their trade or business. But it is worth considering. Ordinary income vs. long term capital gain treatment can spell a big difference. You might have to pay only 15% on long term capital gain. But top long term capital gain rates are 20%, plus the possibility of the 3.8% net investment income tax under Obamacare.Every time you transfer crypto, you might trigger gain or loss. Tax basis and holding period are important, as is record keeping. If you receive virtual currency as payment, you must you include its fair market value in income. Report the fair market value in U.S. dollars on the date you receive it. If you “mine” virtual currency, you have income from mining, and the fair market value of what you produced is income."

Chase's Jamie Dimon calling Bitcoin a fraud. But this hasn't stopped ...","Nov 20, 2018,11:59pm EST","When I first wrote about The Great Bitcoin Scam in  December of 2017, Bitcoin was trading at $15,433 after falling from its all-time high of $19,783 a few days earlier. As I write this article, Bitcoin is now trading at $4,359. Very simply, Bitcoin is in deep trouble. There are investigations about price manipulation, and the use of Bitcoin for payments is down 80% according to Reuters.","The Bitcoin BubbleAs poorly as Bitcoin has done in 2018, Bitcoin is the best of a sordid lot. The website deadcoins.com humorously lists hundreds of defunct cryptocurrencies and related investments that were either outright scams or just really bad ideas, many of which attracted untold billions from investors worldwide who are now that much less wealthy.Whatever else one can say that cryptocurrency has accomplished, it has been one of the greatest destroyers of wealth in the financial history of mankind. Take, for example, Bitconnect which was pitched by this guy to enthusiastic investors and at the end of 2018 was worth $450 -- it is now worth $0.06 assuming you can find a buyer.Nonetheless, hardly a day goes by that somebody doesn't ask me about investing in cryptocurrency because their financial advisor told them that they need ""some exposure to cryptocurrencies"". My response is always the same: They need to find another financial advisor, unless the plan was to go short on Bitcoin.According to retired investment advisor and cryptocurrency watcher Charles Padua, ""It is hard to imagine cryptocurrency being a suitable investment for all but those who are sufficiently wealthy that they can burn wads of cash off a bridge and not be distressed by it.""The fact is that cryptocurrency is starting to make that transition from a bad financial idea to an outright scam. Although cryptocurrency has at best a dubious future, there are still companies out there seeking venture capital from investors to ""take advantage of cryptocurrency"" and which promise to be the next Apple or Google, although exactly what they are going to be doing that will ever result in a profit is anything but clear.The larger financial firms have shied away from Bitcoin, with JP Morgan Chase's Jamie Dimon calling Bitcoin a fraud. But this hasn't stopped lesser firms from attempting to generate fees by attracting investors who largely don't have the first inkling of what they are investing in, but succumb to predictions of instant riches. Far from being folks wealthy enough to burn wads of cash off the bridge, these investors are much smaller investors who are being told, among other things, to use their retirement funds for cryptocurrency investing.There are also predictions about investment performance that make little sense. Take Fundstrat's Tom Lee, who just a month ago predicted that Bitcoin would hit $25,000 by the first of the year. After the most recent price drop, Lee cut his prediction to $15,000 — which means that Bitcoin would have to go up by 300% in the next 40 days. One has to wonder what sort of data  pundits like Lee rely upon to make such predictions. In his defense, Lee is not alone: If you want a good chuckle, check out these crazy predictions for year-end 2018.Without identifying anybody in particular, suffice it to say that a goodly number of Bitcoin prognosticators are simply shilling and attempting to pump the price of Bitcoin up because they themselves are invested in cryptocurrency companies. This is where the scam comes in. Very simply, cryptocurrency investors are being actively misled -- Jamie Dimon's reference to fraud -- into investing in something that doesn't have a realistic chance of yielding the promised results. In the old days of securities regulation, this was known as selling ""blue sky"" and resulted in state securities laws of the same name.Which is all to say that securities regulators, both at the federal and state level, have let the public down by not more actively regulating cryptocurrency investments, setting suitability guidelines for financial firms, and prosecuting the worst offenders including those pundits who are nakedly shilling Bitcoin and related investments. At the end of the day, Bitcoin has become nothing more than a giant pump-and-dump scheme, and investors should be protected from the scheme just as they would be from such a penny-stock biotech company whose sole existence is a website plus a closet with a phone in Salt Lake City, and the promise of someday obtaining valuable patents.As usual, the horse is already out of the barn, but this doesn't mean that investors do not deserve at least minimal protection from cryptocurrency even as interest wanes in this alleged asset class.This article at https://goo.gl/78Zo5gI've previously written about Bitcoin in the following articles:"

Some currencies, however, were designed to keep their prices stable. The recent market fall was a test for these stablecoins – whether they delivered on their promise, or if they were unreliable.","Economic crisis and related business terms word cloud written with chalk on black board. There is a... [+] big arrow chart moving down. A businessman is hiding his head in a moving box.Volatility is nothing new in the cryptospace – in fact, this attracted speculators who bet on their rise to gain hefty profits. But this renders the currencies unusable for daily transactions.Stablecoins have been an attempt to confront this feature. Projects like Tether are pegged to the U.S. dollar, which makes every USDT worth exactly one dollar—nothing more, nothing less. The most important thing to note is that stablecoins are a financial vehicle, i.e. you cannot just “decide” that a coin should be traded for one dollar—what if people believe the coin is worthless? Then, no one would sell anything for that coin, and the coin issuers have to pay more coins to eventually persuade the sellers. The trick is to create a system that would never fall to this scenario. And so far, three methods have been invented: fiat-collateralized stablecoins, crypto-collateralized stablecoins and non-collateralized stablecoins.Fiat-collateralized stablecoins have (as the name implies) fiat money backing their crypto. This means that for every digital coin, there is an equivalent fiat money in held in collateral in a central bank. This system works like an IOU, where every coin is perfectly tradable for an equivalent dollar.Crypto-collateralized stablecoins intend to remove the dependency on fiat completely. This allows them to create a more decentralized solution by relying on crypto (such as ether or bitcoin) as collateral, but they are also more complex as the underlying asset is highly unstable. To confront this instability, these stablecoins are over-collateralized to absorb the shock of an eventual price fall. For instance, a user would need to deposit $200 ether to receive $100 in stablecoins—if ether falls by 25%, the coin still has enough backing to be traded for one dollar. Of course, these projects justify for this apparently $100 loss by paying interest or similar to the issuers, which in some cases allow the issuers to gain more than they have deposited.Without going much into the details, crypto-collateralized stablecoins have a working model that is more decentralized and transparent than their fiat-counterparts, but also more complex.The last category is non-collateralized stablecoins. In these projects, smart contracts are in charge to control the supply and demand scheme and ensure the price stays at one dollar. If the coin is trading too high, the system automatically creates new coins (historically called seignorage). If it is trading too low, the system buys up the coins in the market to reduce the circulating supply. If there are not enough coins to support this action, the system entitles you to future seignorage. In a way, the “collateral” in this system is the shares in the future growth of the system.Non-collateralized stablecoins are complex and the most promising project in this area is Basis, which does not have an official launch date yet. This brings us to the next topic.Stablecoins have been under fire for being doomed to fail. Tether, one of the first stablecoins pegged to the U.S. dollar fell down to $0.84 in mid-October when people started to doubt whether it is fully collateralized. Tether is a fiat-collateralized stablecoin.Critics of this system claim that these coins have no reason to exist, as they are simply copies of perfectly liquid dollars that have been traded for cryptocurrencies with “questionable backing that is awkward to use,” so why not just use the dollar directly?However, this could be said about just any cryptocurrency, not just stablecoins. Digital currencies have obvious advantages such as fast international payments, availability to anyone with an internet connection and the lack of need to go through a banking system.Several big players are offering their own stablecoins, such as Circle's USD Coin (USDC) which is backed by Goldman Sachs, or the Winklevoss twins with their Gemini (GUSD). They all indicate the potential for stablecoins. One of the recent players in this field is Elizabeth White, the CEO of The White Company.Originally a trader of labmorghini and yachts, White quickly encountered the problem with crypto price volatility. For that reason, her company launched the White Standard stablecoin (WSD), the first to be built off the Stellar blockchain (which is 1500% faster than Ethereum, and 1/1000 the cost).White did not repeat Tether’s mistake: “Tether has not had regular audits. In fact, they have had none from September 2017 until June 2018, and none since then. WSD is audited on a monthly basis.” She continues: “Tether's holdings are in an unnamed bank, presumably offshore. WSD holdings are in U.S. based, FDIC insured institutions.”“In the last few days we’ve seen a drop of more than 30 percent for BTC and even greater for other cryptocurrencies,” said Ronny Boesing, CEO of Openledger. The stablecoins, on the other hand, did not crash. Shortly after bitcoin’s fall, USDC and TUSD were trading at one to three cents over the dollar. USDT was trading for an average of $0.97, with WSD in the same range. Openledger’s bitCNY, which is pegged to the Chinese yuan, also managed to keep its stability.This all shows that so far, stablecoins have been able to keep their promises. Of course, they will probably not remain stable for all eternity, but the recent developments shows they have been able to absorb huge crashes after all.This begs the question; what is preventing stablecoins from going mainstream? In the words of Boesing, whose OpenLedger DEX was the first decentralized trading platform on BitShares that started offering stablecoins: “a simple answer is lack of trust.” Many banks and exchanges are still reluctant to accept stablecoins, and a lot of them who accept them did that under public pressure. White’s intention is to make stablecoins more reachable for that public.“Mainstream adoption of stablecoins will follow wider acceptance of stablecoin based payment methods in everyday life. That is why a two-sided network is the best approach to growing use. This means that stablecoins must find ways to allow their users to spend them through existing merchant networks, for example, a stablecoin based debit card like the upcoming White Card. On the other hand, merchant adoption of stablecoin payments will also help increase their use, with services like White Pay.”Will demand for stablecoins increase? Can they remain stable if bitcoin keeps crashing? There are many forces at play. What’s certain is that digital currencies have a much higher chance for becoming a reliable trading asset if they step away from being speculation tools—and that’s where stablecoins excel.Update: an earlier version of this article incorrectly referred to USDC as Goldman Sachs' coin, while it is actually created by Circle and backed by Goldman"

That’s about to change: With the launch of OhioCrypto.com, Ohio will become the first state in the nation to accept tax payments using cryptocurrency.“We are proud to make Ohio the first state in the nation to accept tax payments via cryptocurrency,” said Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel. “We’re doing this to provide Ohioans more options and ease in paying their taxes and also to project Ohio’s leadership in embracing blockchain technology.”Under the new payment system, not all taxpayers can make payment in cryptocurrency: It’s limited to businesses operating in Ohio. Offering the service to individual taxpayers is on the agenda, but Mandel hasn’t indicated any specific timeframe for the expansion.Here’s how it works: If you operate a business in the State of Ohio and you have a tax bill, you can register online at OhioCrypto.com to pay your taxes. You can make payments on any of 23 eligible business-related taxes (you can find a list here), and there is no transaction limit.The Treasurer’s office isn’t holding, mining or investing in cryptocurrency for payments or processing. All cryptocurrency payments are processed by a third-party cryptocurrency payment processor, BitPay. Those payments are immediately converted to dollars before being deposited into a state account. “The State of Ohio is the first major government entity offering its citizens the option to pay with cryptocurrency,” said Stephen Pair, cofounder and CEO of BitPay. “With BitPay, Ohio can leverage blockchain technology and benefit from reduced risk and identity fraud as well as enabling quick and easy payments from any device anywhere in the world and get paid in dollars. This vision is at the forefront of moving blockchain payments into mainstream adoption.”You’ll need to use Payment Protocol-compatible wallets to pay. Those include BitPay Wallet; Copay Wallet; BTC.com Wallet; Mycelium Wallet; Edge Wallet (formerly Airbitz); Electrum Wallet; Bitcoin Core Wallet; Bitcoin.com Wallet; BRD Wallet (breadwallet); and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Wallets. If you don’t have one of these wallets, OhioCrypto.com advises you to create one and send some coin to it.Currently, the Treasurer’s office only accepts Bitcoin for payment, but the plan is to add other cryptocurrencies in the future.There is a cost associated with paying in cryptocurrency (it’s worth noting taxpayers who pay via credit cards or debit cards are also subject to fees from payment providers but are not assessed fees through the Treasurer’s office). Taxpayers paying using cryptocurrency are charged a transaction fee, network fee and miner fee. The miner fee will be displayed in the taxpayer’s wallet and not on OhioCrypto.com. The transaction fee will be 0% during an initial three-month introductory period, and after that time, it will be 1%. Fees are user fees and are not supplemented by state funds. According to the Treasurer's Office, ""The State of Ohio will not pay Bitpay or any other company fees for processing or other services relating to the acceptance of crypto.""It will be interesting to see if other state governments follow suit. A bill to accept bitcoin as payment for taxes was ultimately voted down, 264 to 74, by the New Hampshire legislature in 2016. A similar measure in Utah also failed to pass, while a bill to accept crypto for payments in Georgia stalled earlier this year. However, states are still trying: Arizona’s state legislature actually passed a crypto payment measure, but it was vetoed on May 16, 2018.The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) doesn’t currently accept cryptocurrency as payment either. By law, the IRS issues Regulations (interpretations of the tax code) and other guidance about the kinds of payment which can be used to pay taxes. The IRS has authorized payment by check, money order, credit card and debit card—but not by Bitcoin or other cryptocurrency.

Photographer: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg","After tracking inexplicably flat for some time, Bitcoin suddenly kicked into life last week, but not the way many would have hoped. The major cryptocurrency fell to a new low for 2018 as it hit the doldrums at $5,300, sparking what many have labeled panic. But, there has also been a return to the uncertain volatility which has been a hallmark cryptocurrencies.Volatility has always been an important aspect of cryptocurrencies, but it is a double-edged sword. Without the upward volatility that was seen through the end of 2017, the cryptocurrency market, driven by Bitcoin, would still be very niche and mostly unheard of.However, now that Bitcoin is being sung in songs, spoken about on Ellen DeGeneres, and in full view of the general population, volatility is a scary part of investing, and buying into what has been labeled ‘the future of money’.Having heard of Bitcoin, investors and interested parties alike are skeptical that their asset, especially in today’s bear market, can shed 10 to 20 percent in a matter of hours - that is not the volatility many like.That being said, Bitcoin's burst into the mainstream has made many aware of the other options of the cryptocurrency space and all that can be done, and potentially will be done in the future. There is a clear interest in cryptocurrency from more institutionalised settings, and especially so when talking about the underly blockchain.But, if volatility remains a rather large barrier to entry, especially in light of a slowing in adoption, it brings back to light the growing phenomenon of Stablecoins.Antoni Trenchev of Nexo, a cryptocurrency loans service, has embraced Stablecoins by offering interest on certain ones stored with them on a deposit. But, he notes the dual nature of cryptocurrency volatility and how it could push the popularity of these Stablecoins further.“The volatility typically associated with the crypto space is both a blessing and a curse. Without the huge gains of Bitcoin and some of the altcoins, crypto would not have attracted so much attention, which ultimately is the powerhouse for adoption of crypto in real-life,” Trenchev explained.“Unfortunately, volatility works both ways so the corrections are heavy as well. I think that is the foundation for the rise Stablecoins - the search for price stability. They also come with the ease of transferability and cost-efficiency, which we all like with regards to crypto assets.”Stable-whats?Stablecoins are essentially digital currency tokens on a blockchain whose value is pegged to another asset or currency. They come in many varieties, from something like the Petro, which is the Venezuelan effort at a digital token pegged to the value of oil, to the controversial Tether, one of the first of its kind.Tether essentially defined the idea of a Stablecoin which is pegged to a currency - in this case the USD - in order to provide much more stability while maintaining a close association with a workable currency.The point of a Stablecoin is predominantly to erase any concerns surrounding the volatility of the cryptocurrency space, and thus help make these digital tokens much more workable as a currency; there is no fear of a sudden drop in value, or equally, no anticipation of a potential skyrocketing in price.In very recent times, Stablecoins have become more common and have tried to expand beyond the offering of just Tether. Tether has had many issues in its controversial past. The company claims that each token issued is backed by one United States dollar, however there has been no strong audit to backup that claim.Furthermore, Tether suddenly lost its pegging to the USD in October as the value of the USDT token fell significantly under $1. But, the likes of Gemini, founded by the Winklevoss Twins, have come out with their own iteration of a Stablecoin tied to the USD, which is fully complaint and regulated, offering piece of mind as well as a lack of volatility.Can Stablecoins be the future?The cryptocurrency space is one which is still finding its feet, and as such, there are often teething problems. One that has emerged in the recent past has been scaling. This has seen attempted solutions, such as the Bitcoin Cash hard fork, as well as the Lightning Network, and other off chain options, be implemented and proposed.In the same vein, the volatility issue is trying to be solved by the creation of Stablecoins, but it would be a stretch to say that these alternative cryptocurrencies will be the entire future of cryptocurrencies going forward.“I think that both cryptocurrencies of a distributed type, like Bitcoin, and Stablecoins that are backed 1-to-1 with fiat money will have their role in the future shaping of the financial world,” Trenchev weighed in. “In the past, Stablecoins raised some concerned, especially whether they truly are backed by the amount of dollars that was claimed. Now, with the maturing of the crypto space, we are seeing various companies finding institutional support that has helped bring trust, like USDC, which is endorsed by Circle and Goldman Sachs for instance.”However, there certainly is something viable in the notion of Stablecoins for they not only mitigate volatility, but they suddenly make cryptocurrencies a little more viable and useful as a currency.“Transferring digital asset and cryptocurrencies is incredibly cheap if you compare it to international SWIFT transfers, which can cost up to $50-$60 per transfer! Combine that with the price stability and fixed value of a Stablecoin, and you have yourself a recipe for success.”Attractive alternativeStablecoins essentially do mitigate a large assumed barrier to entry for a lot of general users of cryptocurrency as they can be assured the money they put in is the money they get out, with the added cryptocurrency digital bonuses.But it is also an attractive cryptocurrency offering for businesses. The initial problem with Bitcoin, when it was climbing, was people wouldn’t spend it for fear of missing out on added value thus leaving merchants and other services no need to integrate it as another form of payment.Now, in the bear market, there is low transaction volume and interest as people do not want to spend money only to lose more value later down the line on Bitcoin; this again leaves businesses with no desire to integrate.But Stablecoins will remain steady, and thus can be seen as an attractive alternative for merchants, businesses, even cryptocurrency companies.In fact, IBM, a company which has strongly been investing in the blockchain space, has even partnered with Stronghold in order to bring forward another Stablecoin which will be pegged to the USD as well.“The engineering work has been done on this token and we have seen a little bit of the early release of it,” Jesse Lund, IBM’s vice president of global blockchain, said. “IBM will explore use cases with business networks that we have developed, as a user of the token. We see this as a way of bringing financial settlement into the transactional business network that we have been building.”Cause and effectLike anything, the advancement of Stablecoins will probably depend heavily on the way in which volatility affects the growing cryptocurrency market. Even with its dual nature, volatility provided problems in terms of cryptocurrency advancement, and with the initial wave of mainstream adoption over, the sentiment is less volatility is better.If Bitcoin does start striking back with its traditional volatility, there is every chance that the advancement of Stablecoins will be rapid as an alternative, but not really as a replacement."

Photographer: David Paul Morris/BloombergIt is a giant, real-world experiment with a potentially huge payoff.Blockchain is a distributive ledger system. It is unique because it is completely transparent. Every transaction is validated by complex cryptography. The same mathematics ensure these entries cannot be altered or removed. They exist forever, for all to see.That type of transparency removes the need for trusted intermediaries like lawyers, accountants and regulators. It is efficient, cost-effective and secure.At least, that’s the theory.In practice, blockchain is still an unknown quantity. There has been a great deal of buzz, especially in financial services. Banks, brokers, and insurers see untold riches. They want to cut back-office costs.A 2017 research report from McKinsey & Co., an international research group, claimed blockchain implementation could lead to $110 billion in annual savings for the global financial services industry. Subsequent analysis from Accenture showed savings of up to $10 billion for the top 10 investment banks alone.Away from financial services, Walmart began working with IBM in 2017, to track pork production in China. The companies paired up again in 2018 to keep tabs on the spread of E. coli in romaine lettuce.

And in September, Pierre Nanterme, chief executive officer, raised the forecast for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 to a range of $10.3 billion to $10.6 billion, well above the median consensus estimate of $10.2 billion.Financial services and the supply chain companies are obvious candidates. However, FutureScape, an October 2018 report from global information technology research firm IDC, sees blockchain as part of a larger digital transformation. The shift could be worth $7 trillion by 2022.Companies across the spectrum are now stepping up their investment, to the immediate benefit of Accenture.The stock is down from $175 in September. It trades at only 19x forward earnings, and 2.5x sales. With a market capitalization of $102 billion, Accenture is still inexpensive given the size of the addressable market.More important, the global consultancy has already made the blockchain investment. Shareholders are on the cusp of reaping the reward."

year, with just last month being the worst month for Bitcoin since 2011.","Dec 10, 2018,07:34pm EST",Dharma Wheel representing the Eight-Fold Path,"The Eightfold Path to Enlightened Crypto InvestingAs a new cryptocurrency investor, kicking off your shoes and taking your first steps along the Path of The Blockchain, you’ve probably found yourself asking the following questions: did the bitcoin bubble really burst, is it too late to get started, and what are the best tips to be successful in this newly emergent investment space? While you’ve been asking yourself these questions, along with many others, you’ve probably noticed the prolonged bear market cryptocurrencies have been facing the past year, with just last month being the worst month for Bitcoin since 2011. Taking a more historical view, we see this is only the most recent bear market, of which there have been many before. Likewise, for every bear market, there is a bull market; an endless cycle of perpetual balance, akin to the Taoist yin and yang. Thus, despite the recent significant drops, cryptocurrencies are far from being finished, and the path to cryptocurrency investing nirvana stands stronger than ever.In fact, the securities platform SharesPost reported that 72 percent of cryptocurrency investors are planning to buy more holdings in the next 12 months. You should therefore expect some traffic on your journey and pack your bags accordingly. As with any successful trip, it’s best to be as prepared as possible. In this article, we’ll give you the necessary eight tips to help reach your desired state of cryptocurrency investing enlightenment. Many naysayers in the media and financial sectors may preach that cryptocurrency is simply a fad, over-hyped speculation, or even a pyramid scheme. On the other hand, a growing population increasingly embraces the financial prospects and practical applications of cryptocurrency assets. Both sides have loud voices and like to make a lot of noise. This noise level is only expected to increase, as Satis Group predicted cryptocurrency trading activity for personal investors will increase by 50% in 2019. To be a successful investor in this space, it is best to just buy and hold what you believe in (see tip 4!) while ignoring all the noise around you.However, significant volatility does exist in cryptocurrency markets which cannot be ignored. Experienced cryptocurrency investors are accustomed to huge price swings that you often don’t find in traditional markets. By mentally preparing for these unfavorable, and occasionally terrifying, investment performances, the intelligent crypto investor will be able to act rationally instead of emotionally in times of unexpected price drops. A common mistake for beginner cryptocurrency investors is joining what is known as a ""pump and dump"" group. Certain social media communities or ‘gurus’ may even promise investment tips regarding a particular coin. You should avoid these types of places at all costs; when travelers go down these roads, they don’t often come back. The problem is that since derivatives trading is a zero-sum game, there is always a winner, but more importantly a loser. Unless a solid trading or investment strategy is in place, heedlessly following such advice is the fast track to losing your money to modern-day snake oil salesmen.If you’re interested in learning more about strategic trading and algorithmic strategies, check out our series of articles on our Alpha Predator Model.In this modern digital age, there is even wifi on the path to crypto investing enlightenment, hence there is no excuse to make an investment with little to no understanding of the underlying asset. Almost every single coin has easily accessible whitepapers online. And just like having maps in the car, the savvy traveler must be prepared.From the heavily traded to the most niche, resources such as the All Crypto Whitepapers will help any individual brush up their knowledge on potential future investments. If it is impossible to tell how the coin operates and more importantly, makes money, then it would be wise to seek another investment opportunity. From the biggest initial coin offerings (ICOs) to the most niche altcoins, this site will have you covered.Common investment wisdom prevails when it comes to cryptocurrency investment: diversification is key. Just as financial advisors recommend taking positions in multiple types of stocks and other investments, diversification is also essential for any healthy cryptocurrency portfolio.You've done your research, so now seize the opportunity to invest in multiple coins. As one example, you can invest across different sectors which serve different use cases. Just like it’s always safer to travel as a group then as a single person when you’re in unfamiliar territory, establishing a diversified portfolio will help you along your path toward realizing potential future cryptocurrency gains.Using a regular email account places an investor at an unnecessary risk of exposure for a data breach. To overcome this risk, it is recommended to create a unique account just for trading, especially with added two-factor authentication password security. No matter what, ensure that two-factor authentication is utilized for every service that offers it (for example both your email account and your exchange account should require two-factor authorization to access). Likewise, make sure to use a dedicated two-factor application (such as Google authenticator, or Authy) as opposed to using text messages for two-factor authorization (these are susceptible to social engineering hacks). Additionally, when setting up your accounts, be sure to select a unique username and password that has no personally identifiable information that would-be hackers could trace back to you.Cryptocurrency can be stored via an offline ""cold"" wallet or an online ""hot"" wallet. Ease of access makes hot wallets a more desirable option for the beginner investor. However, as convenient as hot wallets are, they are susceptible to being hacked, whereas cold wallets are not able to be hacked (if prepared properly). Ideally, it’s best to store cryptocurrency you plan on saving for a long time in a cold wallet, and keep only a small amount that you might use on a daily basis in a hot wallet. Additionally, one common mistake made by many new investors is mistaking exchanges for wallets. Although it might seem convenient keeping everything online at an exchange, a common mantra you might hear others chanting goes like ‘if you don’t own your keys, then you don’t own your bitcoin’. And when you keep your digital assets on exchanges, you don’t own the keys. This can become important when exchanges go down, get hacked, or both (for example, the famous Mt. Gox incident from a few years back). Take the time to research different wallet providers. There are lots of great options available today, and you can start learning more by clicking here.Trading or storing large sums of any cryptocurrency via mobile phone is simply too great a risk. Mobile phones are more prone to being compromised electronically or physically. Although convenient, convenience should not  surpass the security concerns that abound with executing trades or storing assets on mobile devices. Hopefully, these eight tips will help give you solid footing on the road toward crypto-investing nirvana. Looking for more tips?

[+] Getty),"The economic impact of Brexit has been much explored and debated. The OECD and HM Treasury have put forward analysis suggesting that Brexit could negatively impact the country’s GDP by 3% until 2020, while the Bank of England has made occasional statements about other dire scenarios, prognostications some might dub “Project Fear 2.0.”These predictions include crashing house prices, spiralling interest rates, loan defaults, asset outflows, negative returns on equity and anaemic stock market performance. It is certainly a volatile cocktail and matters could be heading for a perfect storm. And, whatever else, we live in interesting times with new technologies and their associated shifts and disruptions.Across the Pond, Lael Brainard, a U.S. Federal Reserve Governor, gave a speech at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, D.C., this Friday stating: “In Europe, there are risks associated with deliberations over Italy’s fiscal and debt trajectory and the United Kingdom’s deliberations on the Brexit deal.”
Of course, in Britain we do not  know if there will be any deal right now, nor if the current government will last  or if the Tory party will split itself apart. Certainly, Prime Minister Theresa May has a challenge getting agreement in Parliament over the proposed Brexit deal with MPs and those prospects are looking unlikely - hence the delayed vote.Should MPs in the House of Commons give it the thumbs down, then the chances of a “no-deal” Brexit appear very real. That does not necessarily mean Britain will not leave the European Union (EU) on March 29 next year, but definitely leaves little clarity on what actually happens thereafter. Yet even late last week it seemed that moves on the political front in Westminster suggested the chances of a catastrophic no-deal scenario were fading.And, at the time of writing today money seemed to be placed on the prospect that the Brexit vote will be “pulled”, which opens up a new front of uncertainty for investors. The pound sunk to its low of the day, giving up the 1.27 handle against the U.S. dollar, amid reports that Theresa May is set to pull the meaningful vote on Brexit.Neil Wilson, senior analyst at Markets.com noted at midday this Monday: “Sterling remains at the mercy of highly sensitive news flow around Brexit and this morning has been a case in point.” In terms of pulling the vote, it is hard at this point to draw concrete conclusions about what it means as the situation remains very fluid.But irrespective of one’s views on the actual economic impact of Brexit, surprisingly little public discourse has centered on the opportunities presented by the ability for Britain to pursue a relatively more free industrial strategy.The early nineteenth century thinkers - David Ricardo, one of the most influential British classical economists, and Friedrich List, a forefather of the German historical school of economics - had much to say about understanding and developing the comparative economic advantages of a nation, with a view towards establishing greater relative growth on a global stage.Hirander Misra, CEO of GMEX Group, a British-based technology and business services provider for traditional exchanges as well as cryptocurrency and digital token exchanges, commenting said: “The U.K. has an incredible opportunity to support an innovation economy centered on its relative strengths, namely with London as a leading international financial center and, increasingly, as a technology hub with significant international investment.”Indeed, Apple, Google and others tech firms have all recently increased their presence in the British capital. Add to that there has also been the emergence of several home grown technology firms with valuations over $1 billion (“unicorns”), such as Revolut, amongst others.Hirander Misra, Chairman and CEO of GMEX Group, which comprises a set of companies offering... [+] innovative solutions in a new era for global financial markets. (Source: GMEX).Now Blockchain, or Distributed Ledger Technology (“DLT”) to give its full name, is increasingly seen as a path towards delivering a new industrial revolution - dubbed the 4th Industrial Revolution - by providing a means of trusted communication and exchange that can be publicly verified.The logic behind blockchain is one that is likely to be “as revolutionary as the Internet” in the view of Misra. It is also a view shared by experts such as Matej Michalko, CEO and co-founder of Slovak blockchain venture DECENT focussed on the digital media sector and a “Forbes 30 Under 30” tech pioneer.And, much work and investment is on-going to develop transformational “use cases” for deployment - not only in the most developed areas of financial services - but also in any sector where information is stored and transferred, including healthcare and real estate among other sectors.According to Gartner, a leading technology research and advisory firm, the business value-add of Blockchain will surge to slightly more than $3.1 trillion by 2030 - up from some $176 billion by 2025 and around $360 billion by 2026. That rate of growth is massive. And, while Blockchain technologies might one day redefine economies and industries via the programmable economy and use of smart contracts, Gartner noted this year that “...for now, the technology is immature.”Misra, formerly co-founder and COO of Chi-X Europe (now part of CBOE Global Markets) and co-author of a forthcoming book on the case for a Blockchain economy, asserted in the wake of the start of the 5-day Brexit discussions in Parliament this past week: “Surely the U.K., with its inherent strengths in finance and technology, is well placed to take a leading position in building this innovation economy - and notwithstanding Brexit.”Against this backdrop, DAG Global, a British- based company seeking to set up the first regulated “digital assets bank” in the U.K. to service both the fiat and crypto banking needs of SMEs, fintechs and crypto companies, has recently published a report with the U.K. All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on Blockchain, together with the Big Innovation Centre.Established up in January 2018, the APPG Blockchain its stated purpose is: “To ensure that industry and society benefit from the full potential of blockchain and other distributed ledger technologies (DLT) making the U.K. a leader in Blockchain/DLT’s innovation and implementation.”Their report outlines the current state of blockchain investment in the U.K. as well as the considerable ecosystem which has emerged (with 225 blockchain companies across sectors referenced), and largely without a supportive U.K. industrial strategy. The APPG has incidentally cited GMEX as being one of the leading companies in the U.K. Blockchain economy.Countries such as Malta - dubbed “Blockchain Island”- was the setting this November for a DLT summit attended by some 8,000 delegates - as well as Gibraltar, through the Gibraltar Financial Services Commission (GFSC) and Switzerland- have publicly and actively promoted their relative strengths in fostering blockchain innovation. These countries recently putting forward specific financial services regulation setting out permissions for blockchain companies to freely list and trade.Malta now has comprehensive DLT legislation and regulatory guidance and the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) has issued guidelines for Initial Coin Offerings (“ICOs”), with the latter recently authorizing its first blockchain asset management company in Crypto Fund AG. The firm offers a passive investment vehicle, which tracks the performance of the Crypto Market Index 10 (the “CMI10”) that is calculated and maintained by SIX Swiss Exchange.Gibraltar’s financial regulator announced a year ago the jurisdiction was to introduce the “world’s first bespoke license” for fintech firms using blockchain/DLT from January 2018, in an effort to attract start-ups to the British overseas territory as it prepared for Brexit.This has sent an important message to the market that these countries are open for business, and considerable blockchain-related investment has flowed into them- including Binance, a leading crypto exchange, which has moved its global headquarters to Malta.Nevertheless, as Sean Kiernan, CEO of DAG Global and co-author with Misra in an upcoming book entitled “Tech Meets Trust: Blockchain Britain”, asserted: “The U.K. is better positioned to adopt Blockchain and implement the necessary regulations post Brexit compared to other EU nations, such as Malta, having to deal with the EU as it seeks to introduce overarching blockchain regulations will be a big speed bump, priming the U.K. to be in a better position in the long run as it moves its markets forward independently.That said, in Britain many existing banks will not service blockchain businesses (let alone anything connected to cryptocurrency!) due to fears of reputational and regulatory risk in facilitating money laundering.These fears are not by any means baseless, although recent developments in what has been termed as “Blockchain analysis” help to track every single transaction on the reputable public Blockchains, such that flows of funds can be clearly sourced through to origination.“In this respect, checking flows in blockchain-based digital instruments is more robust than in traditional fiat currency-based transactions, where often it is only possible to trace source of funds only from the immediate prior institution from funds that were sent,” Kiernan stated.The U.K. Treasury Select Committee in recent months issued a comprehensive report (September 2018), citing: “Regulation needed for ‘Wild West’ crypto-asset market.” The report outlined that the country was tentatively positive on accepting such novel blockchain-based instruments. Still much work remains to develop the regulatory frameworks and standards of governance to promote general acceptance.UK PlcLooking at the Cboe’s Brexit Low 50 index, which comprises U.K. companies that mostly operate on a more global scale, it has been outperforming the Cboe Brexit High 50. The latter comprises more U.K.-focused companies in the blue-chip FTSE 100 index.The distinction is measured by where the majority of their revenue is generated. And, the slump after the referendum and the price of the companies making big profits overseas picked up immediately. For a year or so, there was a clear trend. So, if Sterling was up, global shares in London were down and vice versa.Cboe Brexit Low 50 Index and Cboe Brexit High 50 Index over the period from 2016 to 2018. (Source:... [+] Cboe Europe).Employment ProjectionsFurthermore, according to in-depth joint research and analysis conducted by GMEX Group and DAG Global, Britain’s exit from the EU will result in a “loss of 150,000” jobs over five years, with 0.41% annualized negative GDP growth over a 15-year period. But this is not the full picture.On the upside, 250,000 jobs will be created over five years from Brexit and an annualized GDP growth of 3.82% will ensue as a result of nurturing the digital economy in the Britain, according to analysis from GMEX and DAG Global. Therefore, the net result of focussing on digital innovation is 100,000 jobs created over five years and 3.41% of annualized GDP growth, thus acting as a positive counter measure to Brexit.According to the firm’s joint analysis, the impacts of capital outflows as a result of Brexit being “counterbalanced or even enhanced” in net GDP terms by the creation of a wider digital economy within the U.K. attracting foreign investment and creating jobs.GDP Impacts Short-term risks associated with Brexit include the economic effects on exchange rates and investment returns. Now with the U.K. losing its influence over the single market’s rules, financial services would lose immediately compared to other sectors.Over the long term, however, GMEX's Misra and DAG Global's Kiernan suggested that negotiating trade deals with emerging markets (see iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF -EEM with a NAV total return -13.80% year to date, and Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF - VWO for performance), could help the U.K.’s financial sector recoup its short- to medium-term losses.And, over the medium to long term, the U.K.’s GDP is expected to be negatively impacted by Brexit. Falling output means a fall in economic activity and production, which means less business income. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and HM Treasury’s estimates, Brexit could reduce the U.K. GDP by 3% by 2020.The Bank of England  put forth some estimates in a July 2016 report that U.K. GDP could increase by 3% by introducing a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). A comparable effort in Estonia was halted recently by the EU given the imperative of retaining the status of the Euro as the unique regional currency. So, the picture is mixed, if not downright foggy.All that said, Misra, an alumni of the London School of Economics and Political Science, posited: “Perhaps, with vision and some derring-do the impacts of Brexit need not be so negative after all?” Carpe diem.Misra and Kiernan are currently seeking input to a book they are publishing entitled “Tech Meets Trust: Blockchain Britain”, which will further explore the opportunities outlined above. "

Spending a little time now can result in big savings when filing your tax return in April.","First, Run The NumbersSitting down to add up your income and expenses for 2018 is nobody's idea of a good time, especially during the holiday season. Unfortunately, it's a mandatory exercise for serious cryptocurrency investors. Running the numbers now is the only way to figure out where you stand and what tactics you need to deploy before year end to minimize your potential tax liability.The first step is to gather up information about your 2018 income and expenses. You'll need to know your income year to date, as well as your anticipated income for the remainder of the year. This means you'll need to calculate your crypto capital gains, as well as income from mining or staking. Software tools like bitcoin.tax can help with this step.Next, identify the expenses you expect to deduct on your tax return. These would include mortgage interest, property taxes, and student loan interest. Remember, the Tax Cuts and Job Acts of 2017 took away the deduction for investment interest and other related investment expenses, so you won't be able to include those this year (discussed below).  Once you have this information, your tax preparer should be able to use their tax software to calculate your estimated 2018 tax bill. Alternatively, H&R Block has a great free income tax calculator that you can use to run the numbers by yourself. If you're married, don't forget to test whether your taxes are lower as married filing separate. The TCJA fixed the tax rate difference between filing married filing jointly and married filing separately, which means that some taxpayers will actually benefit from switching methods.Start PlanningNow that you know your estimated 2018 tax liability, it's time to start looking at strategies for reducing the amount you'll owe to Uncle Sam. We'll cover some of the most common tactics in this article, but keep in mind that this is not an exhaustive list. It pays to do your homework and find as many tax-reducing strategies as possible for situation. A good tax advisor can help with this part, too.Start By Minimizing Your Capital GainsFor cryptocurrency investors, the best tax planning strategy is to minimize capital gains. Unfortunately, this is usually easier said than done. Here are some ideas:Maximize Your DeductionsMaximizing deductible expenses used to be a cornerstone of year end tax planning. However, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 drastically changed the landscape for tax write-offs as described below. Although there are still plenty of planning opportunities for using deductible expenses to reduce your tax bill, they're not as powerful as they used to be:Advanced Planning TechniquesFor crypto investors with significant income in 2018, more advanced planning techniques might be required. These generally require the assistance of professional tax advisors, but can result in considerable tax savings:The Bottom LineCryptocurrency investors still have time to reduce their 2018 taxes and should review available strategies. Don’t wait until the last minute."

However, Loeffler added that ""with product launches, there are new processes, risks and mitigants to test and re-test, and in the case of crypto, a new asset class to which these resources are being applied.

However, ...","Nov 30, 2018,04:46am EST","Blockchain technology is so synonymous with cryptocurrencies, and especially Bitcoin that it is almost like the financial sector has usurped its potential. In times like these, where an investing bear market has befallen the cryptocurrency space, it is easy to get down on the revolutionary possibilities of blockchain technology.","Since the original Blockchain, that is Bitcoin, emerged, there has been a considerable focus on transactional blockchains which have been at the forefront of the mainstream understanding of the technology. Bitcoin is often the layman’s first point of call with the stories of investing success stories obscuring the view of other possibilities.However, blockchain technology is moving along in an undercurrent separate from the comings and goings of the cryptocurrency market and the financial interest it has garnered in just a few short years. Ethereum and smart contracts have taken blockchain technology to a second generation where many different sectors are in the sights of its potential disruption. Even a third generation is being bandied about, with regards to Directed Acylic Graphs, but the fourth generation - which will be an essential part of the fourth industrial revolution - will need the help of some similar revolutionary technology.  Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been cutting a distinct but similar path through the nascent stage of technology development. Its uses and adoption have been growing, and its implementation has reached a critical point. Both AI and blockchain are in situations where they can benefit from each other, and help one another, regarding reaching their next step on the road to this fourth industrial revolution. There is already evidence of this embryonic partnership beginning to blossom with many sectors feeling their twin disruptive powers.The trifecta: Big data, AI, BlockchainWhile blockchain and AI have been forging their paths with little overlap in their own past 10 years of existence, there is an clear link between the technologies in the form of data. Big Data’s emergence and importance recently have catalysed the relationship between blockchain and AI.The biggest reason for this AI revolution is the advancements in Big Data. These recent developments have allowed businesses to organise a large amount of data into structured components which can be processed by computers very quickly.At the same time, this importance of data has fuelled blockchain’s advancement as its distributed ledger is a new and novel way for data to be stored in an alternative and effective manner. To this end, the need for data analytics with AI is growing, and the combination of AI and blockchain is part of the reason for the onset of the Fourth Industrial Revolution.With both these technologies able to effect and enact upon data in different ways, their coming together makes sense, and it can take the exploitation of data to new levels. At the same time, the integration of machine learning and AI into blockchain, and vice versa, can enhance blockchain’s underlying architecture and boost AI’s potential.The offerings of blockchain, such as its security and immutability due to its cryptographic nature, makes it ideal for storing the highly sensitive, personal data which, when smartly processed, can unlock so much value and convenience in our lives. One of the most significant sectors that are trying to unlock this protection and processing of sensitive data is the healthcare sector. Additionally, blockchain can also make AI more coherent and understandable, and we can trace and determine why decisions are made in machine learning. Blockchain and its ledger can record all data and variables that go through a decision made under machine learning. More so, AI can boost blockchain efficiency far better than humans, or even standard computing can. A look at the way in which blockchains are currently run on standard computers proves this with a lot of processing power needed to perform even basic tasks - such as hashing. Hashing power is a hammer and tongs approach, whereas a smart combination of AI and blockchain would see far more efficient code-breaking.What the Fourth Revolution will look likeIt is clear that the blockchain can tackle many inefficiencies in our technology as it stands, and AI similarly so because of the importance that is put on data currently. However, if it is to drive the fourth revolution, there needs to be an integration of the two technologies which will then have the potential to change some very steady and familiar technologies we take for granted today.Paul Lee, CEO of Mind AI, understands the importance of blockchain technology merging with AI and how it can shape our upcoming future.“One big, immediate way that blockchain can help AI is through its ability to decentralise the ownership and sharing of data,” he explains. “Currently, large corporations with massive amounts of data - like Google, Facebook, Baidu, Tencent - can own their stockpile of user data to create and continuously improve AI.“Blockchain has the potential to break down today's data oligopoly through individual ownership and control of data. This will open access to vast numbers of data sources that can be used by AI developers that previously didn't have access to such data. “This means that there will also be a data marketplace, which can be a free market for developers looking for specific types of data for their projects. In the same sense, AI can boost blockchain, as some of the most compelling use-cases and early-stage applications of blockchain technology is for AI. This will help pave the way for more progress in blockchain technology to better mesh with AI, and this progress and applications will inevitably have a spillover effect into other domains, helping boost the rate of blockchain adoption.”Yoav Vilner, the former CEO of startup marketing company Ranky, adds on to Lee’s thoughts about how data will be redistributed in the fourth industrial revolution.“Making private data secure again will invariably lead to it being sold, resulting in data markets, model markets, and with the introduction of intelligence systems, maybe even AI markets. The markets will have easy, secure data sharing that will help smaller players enter the fray,” Vilner explains.The examples are quite endless, but from de-powering the technology oligarchies, the combinations of these two technologies can also rewire the entire cybersecurity environment, as  Karin Flieswasser explains: “When AI and blockchain are put together, they provide a double shield against cyber attacks. Machine learning algorithms can be trained to automate real-time threat detection and to continuously learn about the behaviour of attackers, thereby thickening the malware detection armour. Meanwhile, decentralised blockchains dismantle the inherent vulnerability of centralised databases, requiring cyber attackers to challenge not one but several entrance gates.”Coming togetherBoth blockchain and AI are continually coming up with new ways in which to advance our technological lives; however, there is no denying they are both very much in the nascent stage. In saying that, the combination of the two as a dual technology to tackle today's problems for the fourth industrial revolution has still got a long way to go, but their intertwining and actioning is moving forward. “AI and blockchain technology will intertwine more intensely and frequently in the future, whether or not the AI project/company is a centralised business or an open source project. We already see multiple great projects around distributed computing for AI applications as well as various AI marketplaces, all utilising various blockchain technology,” Lee explains.“Of course, other AI projects might not need any technological benefits offered by blockchain at all, and that is also totally okay. Though there will be projects and businesses in both sides of the spectrum, my prediction is that blockchain and AI will come together more intensely and frequently, as we will need more transparency, security, and decentralisation in the AI space.""A whole new worldThe fourth industrial revolution will be the first major revolution that has gone from a technology-focused state to another, more advanced one. For that reason, it is not surprising that it could well be predicated on technologies that are currently profoundly misunderstood, and often seen as too advanced. Blockchain and AI have massive potential, but their actual effect will only be seen a long way down the line, and they will also only be effective when tied together as they both boost each other up, and expand on their different capabilities."

Launched at the Latin American Bitcoin and Blockchain Conference in ...","Dec 5, 2018,09:00am EST","Connie Gallippi, founder and executive director of BitGive","BitGive Foundation, the first bitcoin 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, has today launched GiveTrack 1.0 and is supporting four new non-profits to give bitcoin in its Global Bitcoin Fundraiser.Founded in 2013, BitGive's GiveTrack 1.0 is the latest version of its bitcoin donation platform designed to boost transparency in the donation process, enabling donors to give directly to the causes they care about. Last October, BitGive went live with the beta version of GiveTrack.Launched at the Latin American Bitcoin and Blockchain Conference in Santiago, Chile, Connie Gallippi, founder and executive director of BitGive, said that she's hoping the platform will improve the way people give to charities, delivering more impact at the ground level.This technology provides the opportunity to not only fundraise globally without borders, it offers the ability to move funds across the world much faster and cheaper than traditional methods, all while providing a public transparent path of the funds, thereby increasing accountability, she said. With all of these benefits, nonprofits can do a lot more, sooner, and with more transparency to their donors and the public.Since the beta version of GiveTrack, the process from then to now has been a whirlwind, according to Gallippi. She explained that soon after the beta launch, the bull market saw them receiving generous donations, allowing them to use the funds to grow the team and tackle some of the major challenges to bring GiveTrack to the next level. Some of these included those within the technical and regulatory arenas.""We hit the ground running with development in May, and it's been a wild ride throughout the year,"" Gallippi added. ""We had many challenges, some we knew about, most were unexpected along the way, and some were terribly timed. Regardless, the team really rallied in every way, and we are very excited to be able to bring this new platform live in time for the holidays.""Since its founding five years ago, BitGive seems to have reached a level of maturity where it's able to leverage the transparency aspects of bitcoin and the blockchain. Answering this, Gallippi said they are ""uniquely positioned to take this on and drive the concept forward."" However, she noted that the ecosystem and the regulatory environment needs to catch up to their vision and what's possible with the technology.In line with the launch of GiveTrack 1.0, BitGive also announced its Global Bitcoin Fundraiser, which will support four new non-profits on its platform: Code to Inspire, Desafio Levantemos Chile, América Solidaria and Run for Water. Kicking off the campaign, RSK, an open-source smart contract platform, and Bloq, a multi-network, multi-chain and multi-token blockchain company, are both donating $5,000. This will be evenly spread across the non-profits, helping to jumpstart their fundraising goals.Code to Inspire, the first coding academy for girls in Herat, Afghanistan, is fundraising to provide their 2019 class of students with updated computers, faster and more modern equipment, in addition to upgrading the internet connection and speed to boost productivity and the learning process.We look forward to working with BitGive, as we see Bitcoin and blockchain technologies having a bright future in philanthropy, said Fereshteh Forough, founder and CEO of Code to Inspire. By utilizing the GiveTrack platform, we're able to target a network of charitable donors in the cryptocurrency space, which will give us greater opportunity to achieve our broader goals.Desafio Levantemos Chile, which is aiming to provide over 390 low-income children with sports equipment, is delivering an alternative sporting outlet so they stay away from crime and drugs. América Solidaria, which works directly with the poorest and underprivileged communities in the Americas, is raising money to develop leadership skills among those aged between 10-24 to become agents of social change that address the Sustainable Development Goals 2030.The fourth non-profit, Run for Water, is tackling the water crisis in Africa by providing access to clean water in local communities of Ethiopia. It is raising funds to bring the community of Waraba, Ethiopia, an underground freshwater spring.When looking at non-governmental organizations (NGOs), BitGive typically seeks out those with a variety of missions who are located globally and are interested in being at the forefront of bitcoin and the blockchain, said Gallippi.""For this particular launch, we were also looking for organizations that had some experience under their belts in the non-profit sector for reaching the right audiences,"" she added. ""We also had a special interest in organizations in Latin America since we are launching the platform in Chile. Going forward, non-profits can apply to join the platform and submit projects for publishing.""Despite the current bear market, which Gallippi said may have some effect on their campaign, she believes that the crypto community is quite interested in supporting charities, which are demonstrating real use cases for the technology. For this reason, Gallippi thinks that once bitcoin and the blockchain provide an ""unprecedented level of transparency and accountability to non-profits and humanitarian aid funds"" it will become the ""new gold standard.""It may not be that people are widely using crypto directly for donating; instead it may be that the transparency aspects of the technology can be leveraged on the front end, and the fiat vs. crypto components are in the background and less visible to the donor, she added.Going forward, Gallippi noted that they have more features and improvements in mind to reduce friction, offer more services and improve the overall experience. BitGive also hopes to onboard additional charities, projects and donors to grow the platform over time. For the long-term, the organization has plans to add more interesting and exciting layers on top of the platform for visualizing and analyzing real-time data to further improve efficiencies and effectiveness of global philanthropic aid efforts, she said.Previous non-profits BitGive has helped raise funds for include Save the Children, The Water Project, TECHO and Medic Mobile."

Cryptocurrency ...","Dec 10, 2018,09:16pm EST","Crypto-assets have drawn much attention of late. From Bitcoin’s market volatility through regulator puzzlement over how best to regulate Bitcoin’s cousins, stories in the financial press seem as often as not to concern digital currencies, blockchain technology, or any of a growing array of new topics now routinely lumped under the barbarous rubric of ‘fintech.’","Against this backdrop, one hears countless dark augurs and some sunny ones too. Some claim that crypto-monies will supplant ‘mere fiat’ money, liberating us from both government oppression and central bank currency ‘debasement.’ Others warn blockchain will aggravate crime and yet-further shade both ‘black’ and ‘shadow’-markets, which we’ll lose all capacity to regulate. And still others look forward to privacy utopias and revived local ‘circulation economies.’Many a layperson lacking in info-tech education might wonder just what to make of these claims. Must one be a programmer or cryptographer before she can weigh-in on such heady matters?I think the answer where most fintech’s concerned is a ‘probably not.’ Where crypto-currency’s the subject, however, I’m sure that the answer is no. For as it happens, we have been here before.The story of America’s paper money is a preview of the story we’ll soon see unfolding for crypto-money. Our money’s past is, in short, our fintech’s future.I’ll tell my tale in three parts. First I’ll recount our most apposite history – the story of America’s move first from ‘wildcat’ banknotes through Treasury ‘Greenbacks’ to Fed-modulated credit-dollars. Then I shall show how developments in ‘crypto space’ have been recapitulating that earlier evolution, and why that had to be so. And finally I’ll sketch out the end-sate toward which this is all heading – that of a Fed-administered digital dollar, with a comprehensive system of Fed Citizen Accounts serving as that dollar’s architecture.Three Ages and Stages of MoneyDollar bills are the same all over the United States. Take out money from a bank branch or ATM anywhere and you’ll get the same thing for your trouble: a combination of green one dollar, five dollar, ten dollar, twenty dollar or perhaps hundred dollar notes. They’ll all look the same, and they all will be worth the same when their denominations are the same.That is what sovereign-issued currency looks like, even when paid out or lent out by nominally ‘private’ banks. Because they all deal in national currencies, banks are not really as private as you might think. They are licensed by us, the sovereign public, to deal in our money – our Federal Reserve Notes.‘Dealing in’ our money here includes several things, among them taking deposits in the form of that money, administering payments made via resultant accounts that hold deposited money, and even issuing our money, every time they make loans, which they do simply by crediting or opening dollar-denominated accounts directly.In effect, then, banks are franchisees, while we the sovereign public are the franchisor and our national money – the dollar, the monetized full faith and credit of the United States – is the franchised good.You can think of the uniform value and appearance of our currency as being a bit like those identical sandwiches and golden arches you see all around the country (and world) if you like: They serve to let everyone know that the item’s the same irrespective of just where you are in our nation – New York, California; Florida, Alaska ...If a bank abuses the brand by, say, issuing bad loans or over-levering itself, thereby imperiling the value of deposits, it will risk losing its charter much as a restaurateur who sells spoiled food risks being booted from the franchise. That’s how franchises work. They are ‘quality control’ pacts, with the franchisees abiding by the terms and the franchisor administering and enforcing the terms. Where our money’s concerned, we are the franchisor.If you see the truth in this, you might be tempted to think things have always been thus. Didn’t the U.S. make the dollar its money right from the start?Yes and no. The key feature of the dollar in the early days of our republic until the 1860s is that for most of these years it was primarily a mere unit of account rather than a currency. Sure, the U.S. Mint minted coins, the Treasury issued some paper and the First and Second Banks of the U.S. issued some paper as well from the 1790s to 1836. But paper money – ‘notes’ – were issued primarily by private banking institutions until late in the 19th century. Hence the term ‘bank notes’ for most paper currencies that circulated until late in the 19th century.Bank notes were denominated in dollar increments, but were not sovereign-issued liabilities like today’s dollar bills. To recur to my earlier metaphor, the banks were at best franchisees of subnational state governments alike, and at worst franchisees of themselves. Their notes were their own liabilities – hence liabilities of private issuers. And different issuers, for their part, were differently reliable.Differences in banks’ reliability stemmed from a variety of factors. One was that bank regulation was more technologically difficult in the 19th century. Another was that banks then were chartered and regulated, as noted above, by states rather than by our federal government.The upshot of this ‘Banking Babel’ was that the nation’s currency supply largely consisted in hundreds or thousands of distinct bank notes all trading at various discounts to stated par. A dollar note issued by Billy the Kid Bank or Sidewinder Bank might trade at 50% of par, for example, amounting to no more than ‘four bits,’ not a dollar. A dollar note issued by Wyatt Erp Bank or Bald Eagle Bank might, by contrast, go for 90% of par, or even full par.Making things worse, these currencies constantly fluctuated in value, both in relation to the goods and services they could command and in relation to one another. ‘How much money’ you had in your pocket thus varied with whose notes you carried and when, even though all were denominated in dollars. Shopkeepers and tradesmen in consequence had to maintain regularly updated discount schedules behind their counters.If you carried multiple banks’ notes in your pockets, making purchases at the general store could take you much longer than we’re used to by now. Imagine the queues that would form at the ‘checkout lines’ of our stores if we did that now… Scarce wonder that this period of U.S. banking history is called the ‘wildcat banking’ era.Needless to say, private banknote money did not make for an optimal payments system. It was good that the nation had a unit of account but unfortunately it still lacked a widely usable national currency.This all changed in the early 1860s. By that time the nation was embroiled in domestic strife. The Civil War threw up two factors that made something resembling a uniform national currency possible. The first was that the stresses of war made a single and stable currency more clearly necessary than ever before. The second was that the southern slave states, which had always been the principal objectors to federal banking and national monetary uniformity, were conveniently unrepresented in Congress during the war years – they were trying to secede.The upshot was that Congress passed a number of pieces of currency reform legislation, culminating in the Legal Tender Act of 1862, the National Currency Act of 1863, and the National Banking Act Act of 1864, all signed into law by President Lincoln. The Acts together established a system of federally chartered ‘National Banks,’ located all over the nation, all issuing notes convertible into the very same Treasury-issued currency. The latter was called, tellingly, the ‘Greenback.’The legislation of the 1860s transformed our interlinked banking, financial, and monetary systems. In short order there were federally chartered banks in most states and territories of the Union, all of them subject to uniform regulatory standards – including that every $100 in notes be backed by $111 in sovereign bonds) and all of them issuing, accordingly, a de facto uniform currency with a uniform value. These banks could also sell U.S. Treasury securities, effectively making of them a system of outlets for issuance of both of our federal government’s principal circulating liabilities – Greenbacks and T-Bills.The administrator of the new national banking system was called, tellingly, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, or ‘OCC.’ The name is telling because ‘comptroller’ is merely archaic English for ‘controller.’ The OCC, housed in Treasury, was effectively the ‘controller’ – the administrator – of our national currency system. That, and only that, was why the OCC was founded as the nation’s first federal bank regulator.It is almost as if Congress and President Lincoln understood, at least implicitly, that they were establishing a sort of national sovereign money franchise.The OCC remains to this day one of our principal federal bank regulators. It is the chartering authority for national banks, administers those banks’ portfolio-regulatory and other regulatory regimes, and has final word on whether a national bank has gone bankrupt in a way that implicates Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation authority, itself a product of the banking crises of the 1930s.The OCC has less to do with the national currency now, however, than it had for its first fifty years. That is because, by 1913, we as a nation had come to realize that a healthy economy needed more than a uniform currency. It also needed what is known as an elastic currency.An elastic currency is a currency whose supply can be adjusted (a) to accommodate, while not over-accommodating, transaction and credit demand, and (b) to counteract sudden credit expansions or contrations. The idea is to maintain just enough credit-money supply to accommodate desired transaction volumes and enable productive investment, so as not needlessly to squelch either, while at the same time preventing over-issuance of the sort that can spark inflation – the classic problem of ‘too much money’ chasing ‘too few goods.’A money whose supply can be ‘modulated’ in this way, as I call it, is essential if we’re to avoid needlessly disrupting either transaction activity, investment activity, or currency value. And that is to say it’s essential if we would maintain smooth, steady growth of our nation’s wealth and productive capacity.The OCC and Treasury were not well equipped, operationally or transaction-technologically speaking, to engage in what I elsewhere call this daily ‘money-modulatory’ task that an elastic currency requires – at least not so long as state-chartered banks offering checkable deposits continued to operate alongside the national banking system. The Second Bank of the U.S. from 1816 to 1836, and especially central banks of the kind found all over the ‘developed’ world circa 1913, by contrast, had shown themselves well suited to the task.The U.S. accordingly established its version of a central bank, patterned partly on European models and partly on private clearinghouse arrangements among private banks that had emerged in New York and New England, with the Federal Reserve Act of 1913. Like the banking acts of the 1860s, this change too was proximately occasioned by a crisis – in this case, the panic of 1907.The Federal Reserve Act (‘FRA’) of 1913 established the Fed that we all know today, and transferred administration of the national money supply from the Comptroller to this new entity. This is why the ‘Greenbacks’ you now find in your pocket call themselves, not ‘Treasury Notes,’ but ‘Federal Reserve Notes.’ So we now again use ‘bank notes’ as currency just as we did in the 19th century. It’s just that they’re public bank notes – ‘central’ bank notes – rather than private bank notes now.They are Citizen Notes, you might say. They are issued and spent in the name of us all.And what is true of Federal Reserve Notes here is true of bank credit extended in Fed Note – that is, dollar – increments too. The loan the bank makes to you in the form of a newly opened or credited deposit it ‘makes’ in the form of dollar-denominated withdrawal or spending rights. The deposits are functional equivalents of dollar bills.Once you realize this, and once you remind yourself both that those dollars are Fed ‘Notes’ and that you give the bank a signed promissory note for your loan, you are able to see something else too: This is that a loan is simply a temporary swap of your promissory note for Fed promissory notes – of your privately issued money for more widely spendable publicly issued money.This is yet another sense in which banks are franchisees of our money, with ‘we, the people’ occupying the role of franchisor. In effect, we ‘outsource’ the credit-checking and public money-dispensary function to private franchisee institutions. We do so on the theory that they’re ‘closer to the ground’ than our central bank is when it comes to determining what private-public promissory note swaps, which hand purchasing power in trust to those lacking it, are apt to be put to good – that is, productive – use. And we let them charge ‘interest’ – a sort of ‘privatized seignorage’ – for their trouble.This is the money system we now have – the public-private franchise system. It is the product both of the foundational legislative enactments I’ve just described, and of various ‘fine-tuning’ enactments and associated practical changes made over the past fifteen decades – especially in the 1930s – as well.We built this up incrementally because we learned its necessity incrementally. Nothing has changed in the past several decades to alter that necessity. All that has changed are a few of the technological means of carrying out satisfaction of that necessity. And this of course takes us to ‘fintech.'The Stages Go DigitalLet’s call the pre-1860s ‘wildcat banking’ era of wildly fluctuating private currencies ‘Stage 1’ of modern American monetary history. Let’s call the post-1860s, pre-1913 period of uniform but imperfectly elastic national currency ‘Stage 2’ of modern American monetary history. And let’s call the post-1913 period we’ve inhabited over the past century ‘Stage 3’ of modern American monetary history. Where might we locate digital currency development along this phased sequence?It seems obvious we’re at Stage 1 where digital currency is concerned. We’re amidst, that’s to say, digital currency’s ‘wildcat’ era. For one thing, there are many such currencies – indeed, a bewildering and seemingly all-the-time growing array of them. For another thing, they are all of them issued by private issuers, some of which seem to be more or less reputable, others of which seem to be … well, less so. And finally, thanks to the factors just mentioned, these currencies fluctuate wildly in value, both relative to what they can trade for and relative to one another.They’re essentially digital wildcat banknotes.This is not a sustainable future for crypto. Nothing whose value is so unstable can function for long as a bona fide ‘money.’ Something must change, then, before digital currency can expect a future. Absent such change it will stay marginal, a sort of curio for well-meaning techno-utopians, self-described ‘libertarians,’ neo-metalist money-cranks, and of course fools who ‘soon part’ with ‘their money.’ Bitcoin and its ilk will remain, pun intended, ‘bit players.’What, then, might change? What might a ‘digital Stage 2,’ then ‘digital Stage 3’ look like?It seems to me that here, too, the future is obvious. It lies in the past.Note first that, unlike during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, there is nothing to prevent what I’ve called ‘Stage 2’ and ‘Stage 3’ from being reached simultaneously. The reason is that we as a polity came to see the necessity of a stable currency before we came to see the necessity of an elastic currency, and accordingly instituted those things pursuant to the same ‘stage chronology’ of its own learning. Now, however, we’re well familiar with both those necessities, and can accordingly move to uniformity and elasticity in the digital currency space simultaneously.Next, note that the Fed, like other central banks worldwide, is now looking to upgrade our national payments architecture, which as I noted before it administers. Distributed ledger technology (‘DLT’), which forms the backbone of the better-known digital currencies, looks to be particularly promising in the eyes of central bankers worldwide where such upgrading is concerned. Within the next several years, I am wagering, payments systems everywhere will be built upon something a lot like distributed ledgers.The U.S. will be late as we always are where payments technology is concerned, but we’ll still soon be there.When we get there, what do you suppose happens? This too seems easy: The dollar will go digital. The Fed will issue ‘Federal Reserve “Coins”’ and their keystroke equivalents much as it issues ‘Federal Reserve “Notes”’ and their keystroke equivalents now. In this new world, there will be little more use for what I’ll call ‘Wildcat Crypto’ than there was for ‘Wildcat Currency’ after the Legal Tender, National Currency, and National Banking Acts of the 1860s. These ‘assets’ will simply fade out, retained only as curiosities on a par with Colonial Scrip and ‘Confederate money’ or as means of illicitly transacting in criminal activities until caught.This is true even of the ‘stablecoin’ products that have developed in recent months with a view to addressing the wild fluctuations problem. Most of these peg to the dollar. What need of that when the dollar itself soon goes digital.Digital Dollars and a Citizens’ FedA Fed-issued and -administered digital dollar will be every bit as uniform and elastic as the Fed-issued and administered pre-digital dollar has been. It will likely be even more easily managed thanks to the superior tracking ability afforded by DLT. It will also, I predict, be something more: Because of the speed, reliability, and tractability of distributed-ledger-tracked credits and debits, a Fed-administered payment ledger will render quite feasible something that would have been difficult, even if possible, until recently: what I elsewhere call ‘Citizen Central Banking.’We shall soon be able to ‘cut out the banks’ as proverbial ‘middlemen’ between our citizens and their central bank. All citizens will be able to maintain what I call ‘Citizen Accounts’ with the Fed. Not only will all citizens be ‘banked’ – no one ‘unbanked’ – in these circumstances, but the Fed will then have more potent monetary policy instruments at its disposal as well, all while citizens enjoy greater banking privacy.In the midst of recession or liquidity trap, for example, our central bank will no longer need supply cheap money to private banks and then pray they will lend it to ordinary citizens so’s to prime the consumer spending pump. Instead it can credit our Citizen Accounts directly. The ‘pushing on a string problem’ that so plagued the Fed’s QE strategies in 2009-12 will be much diminished. By the same token – again, pun intended – when spending appears to be ‘overheating’ and inflationary pressures loom, the Fed can simply offer or raise interest payments on Citizen Accounts.Meanwhile, because it is under no profit-maximizing imperative, the Fed will have no incentive to sell consumer spending data as banks have. And the privacy-protections that blockchain technology offers – the one salutary phenomenon connoted by ‘crypto’ – will extend to all Citizen Accounts.Direct central banking, in short, is thus apt to be far more effective, saving-friendly and consumer-friendly even than indirect central banking has been. And the new digital dollar – still Fed-issued, still Fed-administered – will make that more feasible than it ever has been.ConclusionThere is of course much more to say about all of this, which I do in more scholarly as well as technical policy-pushing and program-designing work. But for present purposes the point should be clear. Money’s past is always and everywhere money’s prologue. All that changes, usually, is the technical base upon which our money systems are founded.Insofar as the state of the art now is DLT, money itself will be DLT. But it still will be stable, and still will be elastic, if it is money. And that means it still will be sovereign – it will be ‘our’ money.So long, then, Bitcoin, and see you out somewhere some day in the ether, Etherium. Welcome to America, new Digital Dollar.Many golden bitcoins. Cryptocurrency and virtual money concept. Shiny coins with bitcoin symbol "

With Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies steadily losing value during 2018 – as much as 80% compared to their peaks last year – is it time to admit that the great experiment with decentralized, distributed ledgers has failed?Whenever any new technology emerges which has the potential to shake things up, the loudest noise will be made by those selling it.On top of this, blockchain has been tainted in the minds of many, thanks to the large amount of hot air, and outright scams, that have been generated by the cryptocurrency industry.Aside from a large number of exchanges vanishing with customer funds, and later being exposed as illegal operations, the trend of ICOs – initial coin offerings – has resulted in many failed projects and lost money.ICOs are touted as a new way of raising capital for a business by offering digital cryptocurrency tokens which in theory will increase in value as the business grows. However, the lack of transparency around the practice, and the tendency for initiatives to disappear into thin air along with investors' money has led to regulators issuing warnings about getting involved.While these issues bear little relationship with industrial blockchain concepts, which often use private blockchains, the large amount of negative press has undoubtedly led to organizations becoming more careful.This is even impacting the language companies use – where the term distributed ledger technology, abbreviated to DLT, is becoming more common so that businesses can avoid the negative associations of the word blockchain, according to Forrester.Beyond that, Blockchain has other fundamental barriers to adoption. One of these is the fact that it isn't always easy to explain to someone what's so revolutionary about blockchain. Sure, it allows us to keep secure records of transactions – but so do other conventional databases if properly secured with cryptography.Perhaps most damningly are the environmental costs of generating the computing power needed to fuel many blockchain applications such as Bitcoin.Solving the cryptographical challenges that keep information stored on a public blockchain secure requires vast computing resources. Earlier this year it was reported that the Bitcoin network is on course to burn through 42 terawatts of energy in a year – which is more than the entire energy used by countries like New Zealand or Hungary. Producing this amount of energy creates 20 megatons of CO2 emissions – the same as about one million transatlantic flights.Indeed, private blockchains implemented within enterprises wouldn't use energy at anything like that scale – but proportionally, they are still often highly CPU intensive. And with CPU power at a premium thanks to the rollout of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and predictive modeling technology, which have been proven to generate growth, it’s often hard to make a case that blockchain represents a worthwhile business investment.Analysts at Forrester predict that 2019 could be the beginning of a “blockchain winter” – when frustrations and lack of results, together with a lack of understanding of the technology, mean excitement wanes and enterprise projects are mothballed.It may not all be doom-and-gloom, however. Some have pointed out that it's possible that blockchain is a technology which arrived ahead of its time. This is something we have seen before with AI and machine learning algorithms, which were developed in the 1950s, and only today have access to the data and computing power to deliver transformative results. AI has gone through various hype cycles and ‘AI winters’ before it finally became mainstream.Bitcoins, Ethereum and initiatives such as Kodak’s venture into the world of blockchain may burn out and fade away. But the fundamental concept of a shared ledger technology secured by encryption may become more appealing if new technologies (for example quantum computing) can make it a more viable, and less environmentally damaging, proposition.Whatever the eventual outcome, it's clear that blockchain, in general, is taking a less significant position in many commentators’ predictions for where tech will take us in 2019, than it did in 2018. Time will tell whether this means the beginning of the end of blockchain, or merely the end of the hype that fuelled blockchain’s beginning."

[+] cats like these. ,"Blockchain has become one of the biggest buzzwords to do the rounds in technology and business over the past year. Large companies mention it frequently in their earnings calls, according to CB Insights, and myriad startups claim to have harnessed it to put a fairer, more transparent spin on everything from healthcare to publishing to law. But many struggle to explain what it is. First a note about how to refer to blockchain: Is it “blockchain,” “the blockchain” or “a blockchain?”  It seems trivial, but defining blockchain has become confusing because it’s often referred to as both one thing and many things. There are actually different types of blockchains. The best known one underpins bitcoin, first launched in 2009, while another underpins the ethereum network. Sometimes when people say “the blockchain,” they’re actually referring to a wider space known as decentralized ledger technologies (DLT) that include blockchain technologies. Some lesser-known DLTs aren’t public or even decentralized. Ledgers created by Ripple and Hyperledger aren’t technically blockchains, for instance. Blockchain may be the buzzword that’s captured everyone’s attention, but the important new technology to be aware of is decentralized ledger technologies (DLT).  Okay, but still, what is blockchain? It’s a type of distributed, digital ledger. The name comes from the way new information that’s part of a “block” gets added to a “chain.” But it’s easier to think of it more like a giant Excel spreadsheet that’s shared across many different computers. Each time the spreadsheet is updated, everybody can see the change. In this way, a blockchain is a ledger that’s distributed across a network of computers, which records all changes for users to see. The changes made to each ledger are typically known as smart contracts. With the blockchain that supports bitcoin, the smart contracts are quite basic in that they only carry out a simple, monetary transaction.    What’s a smart contract? They are small, automated programs that run on top of a blockchain. So why should I care about that? Because smart contracts are critical to the wider promise of how decentralized ledger technologies could transform industries. The ethereum network had one of the first blockchains to run sophisticated smart contracts when it was established in July 2015. This was an important milestone because it showed that blockchain technology could be put to use for other things besides currency trading. It could break open complex systems traditionally controlled by a few powerful actors, like tracking all the steps on a supply chain or the process of buying property.    If bitcoin represented a decentralized bank that could move money around, ethereum was like a giant decentralized computer.  So what can you run on this giant computer that makes everything transparent?Right now, not very much, and that’s one of the big challenges that blockchain developers are facing right now. The computations required are so complicated that building something which millions of people can use takes lots of processing power and time. Take an app like Peepeth, which is a decentralized alternative to Twitter. Sending a “peep” can take around a day, and involves a complicated process of buying and spending tiny slivers of tokens you also have to buy. The most popular program ever to run on ethereum was a collecting game called CryptoKitties. It was a bit like Pokémon. You could buy a kitty, breed it with another and sell it to other parties. But the game became so popular that in late 2017 it almost shut down the entire ethereum blockchain. CryptoKitties has about 400 regular users today but at its peak had around 100,000 users. That’s actually not a lot if you’re hoping to build decentralized alternatives to the likes of Facebook, Amazon or Twitter, whose user bases are in the billions. Many experts believe that until blockchain developers can solve the so-called scaleability problem, it’ll continue to be a niche technology. See our other tech explainers: Got a tip or suggestion for what we should cover next?

The kings ...","Dec 6, 2018,09:00am EST",Mass adoption in 2019?,"There is still Blood in the StreetsRoughly a year after the cryptocurrency market exploded and surged to unimaginable heights, there is absolutely no doubt that the market is continuing to exhibit bearish signals. The current state of affairs in the cryptocurrency space is of sharp contrast to the status quo. While news articles with negative sentiments and statistics of unsuccessful projects seem to be in unlimited supply, previously enthusiastic community members appear to have lost interest and are selling all of their crypto holdings or restlessly waiting along the sidelines which appears to exacerbate the problem of low volume and tight liquidity within the crypto market. Even worse is the fact that these fence-sitters and critics of crypto are having a field day rooting out and having a field day with the bad nuts in the cryptocurrency industry. At the same time, regulators have also been breathing down the neck of ICO teams and the current regulatory landscape is still somewhat vague.While the picture of the cryptocurrency market looks increasingly gloomy, not everyone is in despair or complaining about the state of affairs in the sector. Blockchain developers, ICOs and those from well-funded organizations like the Ethereum Foundation, TRON Foundation, and the Litecoin Foundation, understand that to bring about real change and improvement using crypto technology, more time and effort will need to be spent on building solid projects that do not simply churn out speculative instruments and to the moon valuations. Rather, blockchain and crypto-projects need to provide useful solutions that can be easily applied to everyday life. Instead of engaging in finger pointing and blaming individuals and projects in the industry, time must be better spent creating or supporting projects that deliver real-world solutions.The Focus Should be on Good Projects Capable of Driving AdoptionAs mentioned earlier, some experts, including Ethereum co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, are of the opinion that before there can be a turnaround in the crypto market, there has to be a change of focus from hyped speculative tokens to projects with real use cases. This way the utility of the crypto projects for users would naturally cause the general public to have a more positive outlook on the entire cryptocurrency space. World-renowned cryptocurrency technical and trading analyst, Tone Vays, is among industry influencers who believe the majority of overhyped projects are still overvalued. In his opinion, the cryptocurrency market must get rid of most of low fewer quality projects before any possible bull run can occur since such projects are unlikely to survive the current bear market.As the audience is well aware, there are multiple use cases for blockchain technology. The world realizes this and there are a plethora of fantastic cryptocurrencies in existence that are seeing absolutely zero use even though they have strong use cases. Naturally, a significant portion of the crypto-community views cryptocurrency as a store of value and others simply use them as investment instruments but this is not sufficient enough to catalyze greater adoption of the blockchain technology the majority of tokens are built upon. Additionally, few of these use cases foster the actual use of cryptocurrencies like the payment use case does. What this means is if crypto-payments are the lynchpin to wide-scale adoption then crypto-payments technology needs to improve to the extent where the network can rival current non-blockchain based payment systems. Hence, it makes sense to put more effort into supporting quality payment-focused projects.It’s not Rocket Science, but it is Complex...One could say that discussing the need for competitive crypto-payments infrastructure is ‘kicking a dead horse’ but it is equally important to address the biggest stumbling block in the adoption of payment oriented cryptocurrencies. This has to do with exchanging different cryptocurrencies during the process of making payments as well as transferring the different tokens across different blockchains. The typical discussion about crypto-payments tends to revolve around fiat to crypto or crypto to fiat transactions, or how to convince people to acquire crypto securely and effortlessly in order to spend it on consumer goods. Making and accepting crypto payments has an added layer of difficulty that has not yet been resolved with a universally accepted solution. For instance, when merchants accept cryptocurrencies as payment, crypto to fiat exchanges are not the only difficulties they face. There is also the challenge of making crypto to crypto payments and exchanges on the fly without incurring loss of funds due to variable exchange rates of crypto-to-crypto pairings, exposing oneself to tax liabilities, or losing invaluable time to logging in, entering 2FA, waiting on transaction confirmations (which greatly vary between cryptocurrencies) and then making the swap (or in some cases sale) into fiat or a different cryptocurrency. In order to have a more bullish 2019 for the cryptocurrency community, such challenges will need to be tackled by various projects and a universally accepted solution is what the traditional financial and business sector will be looking for.At the moment there are projects that are highly motivated to integrate hard solutions that will help crypto-payments reach the point where they can be adopted on an institutional scale. Some examples are the Lightning Network, Light Network, and DPoS. Additionally, there are also cross-chain payment projects that are working on solutions to improve the user experience of consumers, small businesses and institutions hoping to embrace digital currencies.The Market Requires more than just ‘Proof’Proof of Stake (PoS) is one of the more commonly adopted consensus mechanisms in the cryptocurrency space; the system essentially requires that the user prooves and maintains ‘stake’ in a pre-specified number of tokens. Block producers are chosen in a somewhat random method which is determined by a user’s stake. In exchange for their loyalty and labor, block producers, also known a ‘forgers’ are rewarded in transaction fees instead of tokens. In the spirit of constant improvement which is definitely required to propel cryptocurrencies to the next level, Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) was developed in order to improve the PoS consensus mechanism and make networks more efficient by addressing scaling challenges. DPoS speeds up transactions and block creation while preserving the decentralized nature and advantages that make blockchain superior to other networks. The magic of DPoS is that users are able to vote for ‘witnesses’ whom they entrust with validating transactions. Ideally, voters are then choosing trusted individuals to maintain the network and voters also have the option of ‘delegating’ their voting rights to other users. Ideally, within this democratic, decentralized system, users and validators are encouraged to maintain ethical behavior and infractions can result in the loss of reputation, voting and validation right and the income that is the result of transaction fees for block production. While this concept is ingenious, the payments sector does not require arbiters and morally upright validators, those looking to send and receive crypto payments need payments that are convenient, secure and quick.  We’re getting close but not all the way there yetBitcoin is supposed to be the ‘King of all Cryptocurrencies’ and as would be expected of any sovereign, one must lead from the front. The kings and generals of days past would lead their men into battle and duke it out on the battlefield as a way to preserve honor and maintain the morale of the troops. Bitcoin’s opening salvo to push through the dreck and present itself as a legitimate payment option saw the development and launch of the Lightning Network. The idea was that increasing the capacity and speed of the Bitcoin network as a whole would make the digital asset a more suitable payment alternative that could favorably compete with existing traditional payment networks like VISA. The exponential growth seen by the network since it’s mainnet launch is expected to continue in 2019 and at the time of writing the network has a capacity of 448.47 BTC. This figure represents a 314% increase in 24 hours and there is also an 8.8% and 36.8% increase in the number of nodes and channels respectively. Improvements like the Lightning Network have made using Bitcoin more convenient and less costly to use. Adoption and use of Bitcoin have increased but not to the extent that the market requires.What’s Hotter than Lightning? Plasma!Similar to the Lightning Network, Plasma, a series of autonomous smart-contracts which will be built upon the main Ethereum blockchain, will help reduce congestion and high gas fees on the Ethereum blockchain. This is yet another innovative improvement on a DLT that addresses the scaling issue and readies cryptocurrency for mass adoption. The future implementation of Plasma will also facilitate the creation of more power dApps that are designed to solve real-world problems since developers can worry less about congestion and high transaction fees.What’s Faster than Plasma? Light! The Light Network is another innovative blockchain technology that has the capacity to take crypto-payments to the next level and actually acknowledges that cross-blockchain / cross-crypto payments is a real challenge hindering mass adoption. The network is designed as a foundational layer for the construction of decentralized applications and provides a tailor-made solution(s) to a host of problems. The Light Network has the advantage of facilitating interactions between the various applications built upon it and is also suitable for situations that require speedy development of applications.For example, payment applications built on the Light network will allow users to make contactless payments for goods and services using fiat or cryptocurrency with QR or Near Field Communication (NFC). The QR-code system and the NFC technology were chosen by Foton, the creators of the Light Network, and users can make uber-fast transactions that are secure and effortless. Similar to Stellar Lumens, Stellar X exchange, the Light Network and its apps have access to a built-in decentralized exchange which allows users to use the platform’s native ERC-20 based token as the medium through which one can exchange or swap for other cryptocurrencies. This is actually a fantastic example of a solution that could effectively address the payment challenges plaguing the sector right now. If the Lightning Network, Plasma and Light Network would combine forces to offer a triumvirate style product that addresses, scaling, transaction speed, fees, and the universality of digital asset exchanges this would surely make it bulletproof and would lead to widespread adoption of cryptocurrency. What the crypto and traditional financial environment requires is a brand and blockchain agnostic solution that makes it easier for any person, business or institution to swiftly, securely and seamlessly send and receive any digital asset whether it be ERC-20-based, on Bitcoin protocol, a stablecoin, security token or any other type of digital asset that retains and reflects value.In Order for Mainstreaming to come about, Adoption must be EasyWhile this may sound callous, adoption should be easy...or at least easier. Adopting a baby should be easier and if it were more people would go through the process of adoption. The same rationale can be applied to cryptocurrency and cryptocurrency payments. Right now, regardless of what the expert developers and pro-crypto denizens believe, adoption cryptocurrency is too difficult. Point blank, that is just a fact. If if were as easy as they propose then more businesses, institutions and individuals would have done it already.Bitcoin is not obscure. Bitcoin is not unknown. Bitcoin does not suffer from a lack of popularity. Even Jeff Sprecher, the CEO of the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) and the Chairman of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) believes that Bitcoin has a bright future ahead as the according to Sprecher, “somehow Bitcoin has lived in a swamp and survived.” That says a lot, and Sprecher is not the only CEO or billionaire from the world of institutional finance that recognizes the growing value of Bitcoin and other digital currencies.So, in a nutshell, the value is there, the theoretical and applicable use cases are there, but the merging of existing technologies into a bulletproof universal product that can be easily integrated into or better yet, replaces traditional payments infrastructure is not yet feasible. In order to achieve mass adoption, and perhaps another bull run in 2019, greater efforts and attention must be paid to new protocols focused on facilitating super-fast, universal transactions.It makes sense to assume that as more individuals use cryptocurrency for payments, the crypto community will transition from the casino-like speculation that thrives on hype and illusions of market cap grandeur to the development of products that can be easily applied in everyday life. Real positive change will not come as a result of the name calling and criticism by one blockchain startup of another but from the collaboration, promotion, and support of projects that push for a real-world use case that is easily adopted. As reviewed earlier in the text, there are a handful of fantastic projects which are already on the path to delivering very useful solutions. In general, the cryptocurrency space would benefit immensely from each developer supporting such projects. "

Byrne recently announced his intention to sell Overstock.com and place his focus on bitcoin. Photo Credit: Bloomberg News","Everything about Patrick Byrne, the CEO of Overstock.Com, is larger than life. Standing nearly 6' 8"" tall and weighing in excess of 250 pounds; the former boxer, martial artist, skydiver, PhD, Wall Street agitator and bitcoin preacher is not your average CEO.For example, how many CEO's skydive from 13,000 feet to break ground on a new headquarters building? The only one that I know of is Byrne:Beset by health problems including cancer on three separate occasions, Byrne has had over 30 surgeries. Whereas most people would change their lifestyle to extend the years they have remaining, Byrne appears to thrive on the adversity. Byrne embraces confrontation on every level.I have a past relationship with Overstock.Com as a strategy and supply chain consultant. I found Byrne to be an extremely dedicated CEO who genuinely cares about his customers, company, management team and associates.From a consultant's perspective, I was impressed by Overstock's e-commerce platform, technology and innovation prowess, executive team and hard-working team of associates. On the record: I believe Overstock would make an excellent acquisition for several companies.I also learned very quickly that Byrne truly believes in the future of blockchain and bitcoin.Byrne's love of bitcoin is so strong that he recently announced that he plans to divest Overstock.Com so he can place his focus on running Medici Ventures, a company focused on advancing blockchain technology and the adoption of bitcoin. What's Next For Overstock? Based on my assessment as a consultant, I view Overstock as ""The Little Engine That Could...But Hasn't.""Wayfair and Amazon, two competitors of Overstock, have grown market share and revenue on an annual basis while Overstock's growth and revenue lags. Overstock was founded in 1997 by Byrne and launched in 1999. It is quite surprising that a company with such a significant head start hasn't been able to do more.Byrne is a major reason why Overstock hasn't done more. As Byrne's interest in cryptocurrency and blockchain grew, his focus on Overstock decreased. Byrne is a blockchain true believer who is convinced that the technology will disrupt Wall Street and commerce. Simply put: Blockchain is the future in the eyes of Byrne and Overstock is the past. A package moves along a conveyor belt at the Overstock.com Inc. fulfillment center in Salt Lake... [+] City, Utah. Photo Credit: Bloomberg Finance LPIt's true that Overstock hasn't lived up to its potential. However, with the right ownership, Overstock has significant opportunities for growth.Byrne chose not to name the companies currently assessing Overstock for an acquisition. However, I believe the following companies would be wise to explore an acquisition of Overstock:Berkshire Hathaway - The multinational conglomerate holding company owns one of the largest furniture and home furnishings retailers in the United States, Nebraska Furniture Mart. Berkshire Hathaway acquiring Overstock.Com would provide the company with an omni-channel retail strategy that would complement the company's brick and mortar stores.Amazon - Amazon has expanded heavily into furniture and recently announced they are selling a mattress to compete against Casper. Many retail analysts believe Amazon should have acquired Overstock.Com years ago. The fact that an acquisition hasn't happened may mean that it never will. Nevertheless, I advise Amazon to take one more look at Overstock.Microsoft - Retail has become a major area of focus for Microsoft. Acquiring Overstock would be a low-cost entry into e-commerce that would provide Microsoft with extensive data and knowledge related to retail.LinkedIn Or Facebook - I continue to believe that Facebook and LinkedIn have exceptional potential to expand into e-commerce. Overstock would make an excellent acquisition for either company.X5 Retail Group - The largest retail conglomerate in Russia operates over 13,000 stores across three different retail formats: Pyaterochka, Perekrestok, and Karusel. Acquiring Overstock would create an expanded e-commerce and cross border commerce capability that could be expanded globally.Kroger - The largest stand-alone grocery retailer in the U.S. announced a program called Kroger Ship that offers consumers access to 4,500 products that aren't available anywhere else on Kroger.Com, as well as an option for shopping from more than 50,000 groceries and household products.I am a former consultant for Kroger and I vehemently opposed Kroger Ship. I recommended to Kroger to acquire Overstock to take advantage of the company's established online platform and presence selling products across multiple categories.I also made the argument that since Kroger fails to attract the best talent due to its location in Cincinnati, OH, Kroger should acquire Overstock and move Kroger's digital team to Overstock's new headquarters campus located in Midvale, UT.Relocating 84.51, Kroger's analytics company to Overstock's Midvale, UT campus should also be explored.These ideas proved to be exceptionally popular with many inside Kroger who understand the value of Overstock to the company.Consultants and Wall Street analysts who reviewed my recommendations support the idea of Kroger acquiring Overstock.The Wall Street bank managing the sale of Overstock stated to me that they believe Kroger would generate significant positive press from acquiring Overstock as Wall Street and retail analysts would quickly see the long-term value to Kroger.Lidl - I have written extensively about what Lidl must do to succeed in the United States. The German-owned discounter has struggled since launching its first stores in 2017. Among my recommendations is for Lidl to make acquisitions of retail chains and/or merging with a major retailer like Target.Another option is for Lidl to acquire an established online retailer that will allow Lidl to create a business model that will provide a competitive advantage over Aldi and even Kroger.Lidl executives and analysts I spoke with like the idea of Lidl USA acquiring Overstock but convincing Lidl's parent company, Schwarz Group, to make such an acquisition would be a challenge.Menards, Lowe's Or Home Depot - I strongly advise the leading home improvement retailers to increase investment in furniture and home furnishings. An acquisition of Overstock would provide a competitive advantage. Lowe's and Menards should especially pursue an acquisition of Overstock as they need a significant differentiator against Home Depot.Big Lots - Overstock and Big Lots would be able to leverage its combined capabilities to create a significantly improved customer experience. From a capabilities driven strategy, Big Lots and Overstock are a natural fit.Best Buy - One of the more popular articles I have written for Forbes is titled Killing JC Penney. I make the argument that Best Buy should assess acquiring JC Penney. I also believe Best Buy should assess acquiring Overstock.Spreetail - Although not well-known, Spreetail offers customers an exceptional experience. Acquiring Overstock would be a wise move strategically.Instacart - Of all the companies I assessed, Instacart acquiring Overstock generated exceptional possibilities. Instacart has significant potential to move far beyond its current business model.Jumia Group - Africa's largest e-commerce platform. Acquiring Overstock would allow Jumia to expand to the U.S. to grow its e-commerce and cross border capabilities.I am not trying to predict who will eventually acquire Overstock, I only present possible scenarios that could play out.In addition to the companies I listed, Wish, Purina, Boxed, Albertsons, CVS, and Walgreens are among the names of companies that have come up in discussions I've had with analysts on the topic of Overstock.An idea I have come up with is the potential of FedEx, UPS or XPO Logistics acquiring Overstock. I conduct research on e-commerce globally and I have identified the value of large transportation companies becoming retailers.E-commerce is growing in importance to large shippers like FedEx, UPS and XPO Logistics. It's worth the time and effort to evaluate the potential impact of acquiring Overstock.The Overstock campus in Midvale, UT is also an ideal location for many companies including tech companies currently operating in Silicon Valley.ConclusionAccording to Byrne, Overstock will be sold by February 2019. However, I believe that is an extremely aggressive timeline and that a sale sometime in 2019 to early 2020 is more likely to occur due to taxes and other reasons. It will be interesting to learn the name of the company that eventually acquires Overstock.As for Byrne, he is charging full speed ahead to pursue his passion for blockchain and bitcoin.I wish Byrne and everyone at Overstock nothing but the best. "

[+] Credit: Getty,"Note: this post is not investment advice and is for educational purposes only. Caveat emptor!“Don’t cross the streams. It would be bad.” –Dr. Egon Spengler, GhostbustersCrypto/legacy hybrid financial instruments are all the rage. Major financial market players are joining the trend by introducing new products—such as regulated stablecoins and bitcoin-backed ETFs, futures, swaps and depositary receipts, for example.This is Part 2 of a two-part series. In Part 1, I defined major differences between the legacy and crypto settlement systems—one system embraces unsettled trades and imprecise ledgers while the other doesn’t—and explained why the category of “crypto wrapped around legacy” hybrids involves fewer operational risks than the category of “legacy wrapped around crypto” hybrids. In Part 2, I’ll explain what these differences mean for owners of hybrid products.More Background, Which Leads to a Key Question“Crossing streams” is risky business. Continuing with the war story introduced in Part 1, I’ve experienced how hard it is to “cross streams” in many situations that were entirely confined within the legacy settlement system—which itself is messy. But by piling on the added complexity of crossing over between crypto and legacy, the settlement for crypto/legacy hybrids will be even trickier—and much riskier for crypto-backed ETFs, futures and other “legacy wrapped around crypto” hybrids.My experiences came from deep and broad interactions with the legacy settlement system from 2010-2016. And while I was buried in the weeds of settlement details for the first multi-billion-dollar pension transfer transactions in 2012, I came across bitcoin. Seeing the simplicity of its settlement system while mired in the morass of the legacy settlement system, it became obvious that yes, there is a better way to settle financial transactions!Pension transfers are a form of “stream-crossing”—they cross streams between pension plans and insurance companies in order to settle pension obligations with regulated, fully-funded and irrevocable annuities. They require threading a needle to settle the same-day transfer of assets and liabilities worth billions of dollars each, while also threading a needle between very different ERISA and insurance regulations governing each. No one had done this before 2012—all prior transactions were very small and all-cash, but for many reasons the large transactions are paid for mostly by in-kind asset transfers using very specific assets—hence the settlement risk. Different types of assets settle on different time schedules, as you already know—publicly-traded securities settle T+2 days (T+3 days back then) and private securities and partnership interests can take days or even weeks to settle. Cash is the only asset that’s designed to settle same-day (on Fedwire)—and even then, it’s not as easy as you’d think because multi-billion-dollar wire transfers between non-bank counterparties are fairly rare (which is why their banks usually directly involve the Fed itself). And ever-present is the risk of intra-day default by a financial intermediary after the assets have been sent but before they are received.Here’s the constraint—in pension transfers, everything must settle same-day. It’s illegal for an insurance company to settle an annuity contract unless it’s 100% paid for, and it’s also illegal for the pension plan to transfer assets without receiving value in return. So, everything absolutely must settle same-day—there’s zero fault tolerance. Consequently, settling pension transfers same-day requires intricate orchestration and practice in advance. The detailed planning involved—especially in those first transactions—was staggering (a sense of which you could glean from redacted SEC filings or this Harvard Business School case study). Large teams of many talented people have pulled off these huge pension transfers successfully, again and again, since the first one was completed in 2012.I share this context to help you understand the complexity of settlement processes in the legacy financial system—which is a mess, quite frankly. Judge Travis Laster of the Delaware Chancery Court says it perfectly: “The current system works poorly and harms stockholders.”The crypto settlement system is much simpler and fairer.But the two systems are very different, and therefore so are the skill sets required to master them.So, here’s the question everyone should ask when analyzing a crypto/legacy hybrid: what are the skill sets of the people involved, both regarding technology and operations—does anyone involved have deep experience in both the legacy and crypto systems? This is material information that every issuer of a crypto/legacy hybrid product should publicly disclose, in my opinion.Aside from that basic question, here are generic thoughts about crypto/legacy hybrids. Again, these are high-level generalizations and every hybrid instrument will be different. I make no recommendations, other than this:  do your own homework, and read the fine print!What Do Differences in Settlement Systems Mean for Crypto/Legacy Hybrids? When the hybrid instrument and the underlying asset backing it are settling in different settlement systems, problems will inevitably arise—because they “cross the streams” between settlement systems that, from my experience in both, cannot be melded together without problems. Timing mismatches and settlement failures are bound to happen. The impact will most likely appear as a price divergence between the price of the hybrid and its underlying asset, and periodically those price differences are likely to be big.Currency pegs eventually fail, and for technical reasons the price of ETFs and depositary receipts can massively diverge from the price of the assets backing them—these things already happen in traditional financial markets periodically. The same will be true for all crypto/legacy hybrids—but additionally they face the risks introduced by crossing over the two settlement systems. A good example of an issue that may arise is the loss of a 1:1 peg by Tether, the first stablecoin.But for “legacy wrapped around crypto” hybrids—bitcoin-backed ETFs, futures, swaps and depositary receipts—the risk is even bigger because the legacy system inherently loses track of 1:1 backing due to unsettled trades and rehypothecation (the latter of which causes a systemic short that grows insidiously over time). Audits can’t catch the amount of divergence caused by rehypothecation, since US GAAP requires both parties to record that they own the same rehypothecated asset as long as the borrower records a new dollar of debt against it—that’s why I refer to rehypothecation as an insidious, hidden form of leverage. Multiple parties report that they own the very same asset—!! Audits are therefore useless protections against uncovered exposures that grow undetected at a systemic level (i.e., less than 1:1 collateralization)—because while your intermediary may achieve a clean audit (showing 1:1 backing), no one knows if the system as a whole has 1:1 backing. Systemic 1:1 backing is what really matters, not whether your intermediary has 1:1 backing, and in the legacy settlement system systemic 1:1 backing simply cannot be confirmed. So, don’t be surprised to see big price gaps emerge for these “legacy wrapped around crypto” hybrids when a reckoning event someday tests the degree of their collateralization. A reckoning event could be a hard fork, a “run-on-the-bank” confidence scare or a “honeypot” hack attack of the custodian/warehouse that holds the private keys (whether real or merely rumored). Remember, there’s no fault tolerance in the crypto settlement system.Dollars can’t be tracked on a blockchain because dollars aren't issued, traded and settled on a blockchain, and neither is any fiat currency. Consequently, no stablecoin can possibly offer perfect transparency. It doesn’t matter whether the stablecoin is regulated or unregulated—neither can be fully transparent. The same is true for tokenized gold, diamonds or any other asset that isn’t natively-blockchain. Unless the underlying asset is itself natively issued, traded and settled on a blockchain, there will always be a break in the digital chain of information and 100% transparency will be impossible.The legacy settlement system is so complex that regulators allow fault tolerance to keep it functioning as well as it does. The main form of fault tolerance is “operational shorting,” another name for fault tolerance coined by authors of a recent academic paper. In simple terms, operational shorting happens when a broker/dealer sells non-existent securities that it will later seek to obtain (or, in the case of an ETF, that it can create later). If it can’t obtain the securities, it will “fail to deliver.” This practice of selling something you don’t own would be fraud if you or I did it—but it's allowed to occur daily in financial markets! Broker/dealers can simply compare the cost of delivering versus the penalties for failing to deliver, if any, and choose the cheapest option. Failures-to-deliver sometimes incur no penalty for the broker/dealer. Operational shorting is similar to fractional-reserve banking—the process creates an uncovered short position at a systemic level. (Many will defend operational shorting as a normal part of market-making. I criticize it vehemently. It violates basic property rights. It allows today’s trades to be settled with tomorrow’s trades (or later). It favors liquidity at the expense of solvency. It means regulators can’t keep track of how leveraged the system is—even audits can’t catch this, as discussed earlier. It’s one of the ways the legacy financial system is unfair to Mom & Pop investors—inherently, but not always nefariously—because it suppresses the price of the asset and permits intermediaries to profit from bid-offer spreads on non-existent assets. It's permissible theft by another name...but I digress...)The academic paper about operational shorting contains a treasure trove of data about failures-to-deliver, which is a daily occurrence in legacy financial markets and is on the rise in ETF markets specifically.I found the following figure from the paper helpful because it shows how failures-to-deliver work and displays four different options available to a broker/dealer before the appointed settlement time (in this example, the broker/dealer is an “authorized participant” acting as an ETF market-maker). If it elects Option 4 and fails to deliver on schedule, it gains another three trading days to settle the trade. (Important caveat—the figure shows T+3 settlement but markets have moved to T+2 since this figure was published.)AP = authorized participant (a dealer authorized to create new ETF shares on behalf of the ETF... [+] issuer).Regardless, the key takeaway for you is that the legacy financial system permits unsettled trades, which creates the possibility of operational shorting and failures-to-deliver. This creates more claims to the asset than there are assets. Remember, in a crypto settlement system, such operational shorting and failures-to-deliver simply cannot occur because buyer and seller exchange value simultaneously.I don’t provide investment advice but strongly encourage everyone to do your homework and read the fine print, because small differences in settlement procedures can someday cause big price divergences in hybrids relative to underlying assets—and this is especially true of “legacy wrapped around crypto” hybrids, such as bitcoin-backed ETFs, futures, swaps and depositary receipts.If every issuer of a “legacy wrapped around crypto” instrument followed these rules, the issuer would go a long way to minimizing the risks both to buyers and to themselves:Again, though, this is not how the legacy settlement system works. Rehypothecation is as integral to Wall Street as it is antithetical to bitcoin, and the reality of unsettled trades, delays in margin calls, collateral substitution and other differences means no issuer will ever be 100% collateralized all the time—even intra-day.Still, issuers of “legacy wrapped around crypto” hybrids could significantly improve transparency by publishing verifiable NAVs (by disclosing public keys). Crypto exchanges that take custody of customers’ crypto have for many years grappled with this same issue. Kraken, for example, offers a type of “proof of reserves” audit, and a group of researchers proposed a privacy-preserving method for crypto exchanges to prove solvency called “Provisions.” (Disclosure: I’m an investor in Kraken.)Of course, though, it’s simply not possible for any issuer of a “legacy wrapped around crypto” hybrid to provide 100% transparency because settlement “crosses the streams” of two different systems. This applies to custodial crypto exchanges too. Caveat emptor!“Bitcoin in your 401(k)” is very misleading marketing. Almost certainly you won’t ever own real bitcoin in your 401(k), simply because most 401(k)s only invest in funds and bitcoin is not a fund. “Buy bitcoin through your stock broker”—don’t be fooled if you see this either. Unless you hold the private keys, your stock broker isn’t selling you real bitcoin. If anyone else holds the private keys, what you own is a substitute—an IOU from your intermediary—rather than the real thing. Yes, a bitcoin ETF or a bitcoin mutual fund could someday be in your 401(k). But not real bitcoin—not real, base-layer bitcoin. Again, “not your keys, not your bitcoin.”Yes, bitcoin really is different than traditional assets—it has no lender of last resort, its settlement system has no fault tolerance, there is no clearinghouse to facilitate failures-to-deliver it. By design, Bitcoin has zero flexibility in its settlement system and that critical distinction relative to legacy financial instruments means it will be harder for Wall Street to get away with misleading marketing. Any intermediary that markets a bitcoin hybrid as if it were the real thing faces lawsuit risk—plaintiffs' attorneys are likely to have a field day.Be careful, everyone involved—on all sides! Do your homework and read the fine print!Stablecoins…Oh, the Irony!Necessity, as they say, is the mother of invention, and stablecoins were born out of necessity. The banking sector has largely shunned the cryptoasset sector and made it difficult (and expensive) for customers to convert crypto to fiat. The crypto sector responded by creating stablecoins, a dollar proxy meant to obviate the need for frequent crypto traders to convert to actual fiat when they want to reduce price risk in their portfolios. Here’s the irony:  stablecoins have the potential to become a powerful disruptive force in traditional payments, doing an end run around the very banking system that largely shunned crypto in the first place!Some very astute financial minds—including legendary investor Stanley Druckenmiller, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh and executives at many companies rushing to issue stablecoins—rightly saw much broader applications for them:  in institutional payments.For institutions, stablecoins solve a real problem that the legacy financial system doesn’t solve—settling dollar payments with simultaneous delivery-versus-payment (DVP) and on a real-time gross settlement (RTGS) basis. Regulated stablecoins have the potential to become useful much faster than “utility settlement coin” (which began in 2015) and similar efforts of the incumbent banking industry to speed up payment settlement—because stablecoins are freed from the cruft that weighs down incumbent payment systems. To achieve this, though, they need to jump through critical hoops—they need to avoid classification as a security, and accountants need to classify them as “cash-equivalents” so owners can value them at par.Here’s potential I see for stablecoins that meet these criteria and gain liquidity:If you’re interested in learning more about the “comfort deposits” issue and the opportunity to release huge amounts of trapped capital, here’s my interview on the topic with Dave Morton, then-CFO of Seagate Technology.Here are some open questions regarding stablecoins:ConclusionSettlement is a complicated subject, but when it comes to preserving your wealth it’s a critical topic—what do you own, really? Are most of your financial assets actually IOUs? This whole discussion boils down to one simple fact: the legacy settlement system embraces unsettled trades and imprecise ledgers, while the crypto settlement system does not.  “Crossing the streams” between legacy and crypto will pose some of the biggest operational challenges that have ever existed in financial services. No one should be under any illusion that the two systems can be seamlessly melded together. Caveat emptor for all crypto/legacy hybrids. Do your homework. Read the fine print!The legacy system’s embrace of fault tolerance to band-aid its myriad problems may sound good at first blush, but that’s exactly what makes the financial system unstable and unfair. If we could start over from scratch, I believe we’d adopt a purely crypto-based financial system—because as a settlement system, it is far superior. It’s an honest ledger. As more folks learn about this, as more institutional investors invest in this, and as more issuers issue security tokens and other natively-blockchain assets, the end-run around the legacy settlement system will accelerate.All this innovation is worth celebrating! "

Charities Accepting Crypto Donations On The Rise,https://www.forbes.com/sites/rebeccacampbell1/2018/11/27/its-givingtuesday-charities-accepting-crypto-donations-on-the-rise/,"So much so, that non-profit organizations are now accepting donations in 
bitcoin, ethereum, bitcoin cash, litecoin and other crypto assets.","Nov 27, 2018,12:00pm EST",Giving Tuesday,"Today is #GivingTuesday. Following Thanksgiving, Black Friday and Cyber Monday, Giving Tuesday is an international day of charitable giving that celebrates in helping others.Last year, an estimated $274 million was raised online in the U.S., up from $180 million in 2016 and $10 million in 2012 when it first began. According to Blackbaud, a cloud software company powering social good, it expects to see a rise in online and mobile giving this Giving Tuesday.Yet, while fiat continues to play a role in charitable donations, the acceptance of crypto is steadily rising. So much so, that non-profit organizations are now accepting donations in bitcoin, ethereum, bitcoin cash, litecoin and other crypto assets. Some of these include UNICEF, Save the Children, Houston Area Women’s Center (HAWC), a non-profit organization that helps survivors of domestic and sexual violence build safe and healthy lives, Sea Shepherd, the Water Project and the Against Malaria Foundation.According to Davide Menegaldo, COO at Helperbit, a blockchain startup aimed at changing the way money is donated to charities, more needs to be done to bring attention to donors the charities that accept crypto. He believes that initiatives like Tour de Crypto, who are aiming to raise $1 million in crypto and fiat for HAWC, is a positive example of a charity combining crypto.To date, Helperbit has received 344 donations, amounting to nearly $100,000 in bitcoin from 1,209 users. In light of Giving Tuesday, the platform launched its Fundraising Campaign earlier this month, enabling people, influencers and communities to create their own crypto fundraising page for a non-profit of their choosing.Simplify the access to crypto donations and increase the community engagement are some of our main value propositions, Menegaldo said. This service has been developed precisely to achieve these goals: using this bottom-up approach, we provide the tools for a more decentralized way to raise funds.A 2018 Technology Report from Global NGO, shows that bitcoin is only accepted by 1% of NGOs online; however, it adds that cryptocurrencies are likely to become more widely accepted in the years to come.A rise in crypto prices may also spur people to donate their holdings to good causes. Last year, for instance, the Pineapple Fund, a philanthropic project created by an anonymous individual, donated 5,104 bitcoin to 60 charities, amounting to nearly $56 million during the crypto bull run last December. Of course, while 2018 hasn't produced the same for the market, Blake Rizzo, head of charity affairs for Tour de Crypto, said that charities such as HAWC, which accepts bitcoin, ethereum, litecoin and monero, to name a few, are ahead of the game.""They are immediately able to tap into a previously-formed, global social media network of crypto enthusiasts that are searching for ways to do good and promote mass adoption through good intentions,"" he added.The same can be said for UNICEF New Zealand. The organization started accepting crypto in March. It accepts bitcoin, ethereum, bitcoin cash and litecoin.Accepting crypto is just one example of how UNICEF is constantly trying to innovate in order to reach as many children around the world as possible, said Lachlan Forsyth, communications director at UNICEF NZ. We're also exploring blockchain as a technology and looking at applications for how it can assist with UNICEF's development work around the world. UNICEF Innovations is leading that work, with support from UNICEF NZ.While crypto donations remain small compared to traditional donations, Forsyth added that they mainly receive transactions in bitcoin and ethereum.The Charities Aid Foundation (CAF) doesn't currently accept crypto donations. Yet, it has done a lot of research and thinking on the subject. This year, it submitted a report to HM Treasury inquiry on crypto assets, which saw its in-house think tank, Giving Thought, looking at the acceptance of crypto donations.""In broad terms, our view is that crypto donations are potentially interesting insofar as they represent a new potential pool of resources for charities,"" said Rhodri Davies, head of policy & programme leader at Giving Thought. ""The evidence from the U.S. in terms of the increasing volume of crypto-philanthropy suggests that there is certainly reason to pay attention.""For some charities, though, the market's volatility and a lack of understanding may be hindering them from putting measures in place to accept crypto donations. However, as can be seen from the 2017 bull run, when crypto holders are suddenly handling an unimaginable amount of money they may want to donate to a charitable cause of their choice.Not only that, but using a blockchain platform that enables donors to track their donations in real time to the beneficiary will bring a new level of confidence to the charity industry."

Many startups there are finding it increasingly difficult to gain access to capital as investors grow skeptical of the fundamental claims around digital currencies and the blockchain technology that underpins them.With visions of a decentralized new world order, many blockchain ventures had been touting themselves with the promise of new disruptive applications that would upend industries and revolutionize economies. But in hindsight, many of those startups were either exaggerating their potential benefits or the time that would be required to achieve them.""It is a period of disillusionment. As much as I am a believer in the long term disruptive power of blockchain, it cannot solve all the problems in the world,"" says Bonnie Cheung, a venture partner at 500 Startups. ""You don't know how many times we have read proposals that claimed to solve all pain points for almost every industry.""But ten years after the publication of Satoshi Nakamoto's famous white paper that gave birth to the blockchain concept, there are still no killer apps or transformational platforms in terms of real-world use cases of blockchain. Even the most mature application of payment – in the form of cryptocurrencies – appears to be losing some ground. The use of bitcoin in transactions handled by major payment processors dropped nearly 80% in the year up to September, according to Chainalysis.""What has been reported by the media that around 40% of blockchain projects have shut down is too conservative,"" says He Ning, chief operating officer of QOS, a venture that aims to create the infrastructure for large-scale commercial uses of blockchain.""For any industry, around 20% of startups should fail when the sector's market value drops 10%. With the kind of market collapse the crypto market has seen lately, almost all speculators have left, but that's far from enough. I feel it takes around getting rid of 99% of crypto exchanges and unrealistic projects for a new wave of bull market to arrive,"" he says.To be sure, even as faith in blockchain ventures has been on the wane in China and industry participants have either departed the industry or are preparing to do so, there are still others who have been wading in with aims to cash in on the crash, and some of the earliest adopters are even celebrating what they see as a healthy shakeout of the industry.""The blockchain industry has flushed out some poor-quality projects, and the entry barrier to the industry has increased, which is beneficial to the sector's future growth,"" said Hubery Yuming Yuan, CEO of Huobi China, who left brokerage firm Industrial Securities to join Huobi in March. ""The (crypto) bubble burst has led to a more rationalized industry, and we have seen more practical attempts at blockchain applications.""Yuan believes that many strong projects are continuing their development work and have not been impacted by the market's downturns. ""Solid public blockchain projects and numerous popular decentralized apps are gaining momentum,"" he says. ""Chinese enterprises and conglomerates continue to explore new blockchain use cases.""It is increasingly clear that the bear market in cryptocurrencies has accentuated a market bifurcation.""Only a few projects – most likely those under big institutions - will eventually do well. Ultimately, it's winner takes all,"" says Xinghua Luo, cofounder of BBShares, a hedge fund offering index funds in crypto assets. Luo is among those who are continuing to bet on the long-term future of cryptocurrency as an alternative asset class that eventually will be incorporated in most investment portfolios.If the future of blockchain is ""winner takes all"" and a concentration of success by a few of China's top players, what does it mean to one of blockchain's fundamental promise of decentralization?The prospects of blockchain applications have become narrower, and more people are starting to suggest that China's blockchain ecosystem will eventually need to function mostly within a centralized structure. And the recent buzz around security token offerings (STO) represents a new form of token offering that exemplifies this because it actually complies with existing legal frameworks.Earlier this month, an investor and cofounder of a Chinese blockchain project staged a dramatic departure. Yang Ning of CDC, a smart contract platform aiming to build a decentralized global consumer data asset exchange on the blockchain, blasted the entire industry in a media interview, while proclaiming that blockchain's future can only exist under a centralized legal structure. For example, programs that would fall under the authority of China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology.Yang's case is somewhat emblematic of the dilemma faced by the blockchain community, and that is centralization happens quite naturally in many markets. Bitcoin, the largest of the cryptocurrencies, has seen a significant level of centralization in its mining, asset holding and computing power distribution. Bitmain Technologies is said to have approximately 42% control of the bitcoin network hashrate -- a measure of the computing power dedicated to mining the digital currency. It is also the largest producer of bitcoin mining machines, and operates the largest bitcoin mining pools.Moreover, blockchain's real-world use cases are showing signs of becoming more narrowly defined. ""Unlike steam engines, electricity, computers, artificial intelligence and quantum computing, blockchain is not a productivity revolution,"" Huobi's Yuan said. ""Blockchain is similar to printing, papermaking, and the internet. It can liberate productivity even though perhaps it does not represent a fundamental technology breakthrough.""While the markets look likely to remain volatile, blockchain investors find themselves facing unexpected challenges. For 500 Startups' Bonnie Cheung, even success in blockchain could mean tricky problems. For instance, how to exit from truly distributed systems that generates huge revenues, but are difficult to sell as an asset?""How do you convert an investment that started as a venture deal to something that ended up almost like a bond? Can you lend that bond? These are all interesting questions that will need to be answered in the future,"" says Cheung."

for example -- but could be another sidechain. When you want to ...","Nov 27, 2018,07:45am EST",Getty,"What’s the biggest threat to blockchain adoption?Scalability. Without it, even the most sophisticated blockchains -- decentralized applications and decentralized exchanges -- will be too slow to use. As you can see below, Bitcoin and Ethereum lack the transactional capacity required for worldwide adoption:• Bitcoin: seven transactions per second.• Ethereum: 15 transactions per second.
• VISA: 24,000 transactions per second.Add the expected transaction load of blockchain’s most promising projects -- including our decentralized exchange -- and chances are the whole system could break. Look at what happened with CryptoKitties in 2017. At the time, the game accounted for over 10% of Ethereum network traffic, multiplying pending transactions by a factor of six. If one popular dApp can significantly slow down the network, what would hundreds do?  So What Exactly Is The Problem?Scalability, decentralization and security. You can have two but not all three. It’s essentially a blockchain design flaw -- otherwise known as the scalability trilemma.As the two most popular blockchains, Ethereum and Bitcoin are working hard to solve this problem with a range of proposals that extend their transactional capacity without sacrificing decentralization or security. But others -- like EOS -- are building completely new blockchains with scalability built in. Today, we’re going to look at sidechains. Not only do they help blockchains scale, but they shift development to a safe place, allowing for greater innovation without risking the integrity of the established blockchain.What Are Sidechains And How Do They Work?Sidechains are blockchains that run alongside a root or “parent” chain. The root chain is usually the established blockchain -- Bitcoin or Ethereum for example -- but could be another sidechain. When you want to transfer funds, they’re locked on the root chain and then released on the sidechain. Those same funds can then move around the sidechain until they return to the root chain when the process reverses. A symmetrical two-way peg ensures a fixed exchange rate. To avoid double spending and other fraud, a trusted body or federation might run nodes on both the root and sidechain. But to maintain decentralization, a better solution might be simplified verification proofs (SPVs). An SPV proves a coin is reserved on the root chain for use on the sidechain. Rather than checking all previous transactions, which would be slow, an SPV proves your transaction is part of a valid block, that new blocks have since been created and that miners trust the validity of this block. Both Bitcoin and Ethereum currently support SPVs in the form of Merkle proofs, but they’re not identical. Where Ethereum Merkle proofs can secure sidechains in a Plasma framework, Bitcoin would require a soft fork to support SPV-like sidechains. Why Are Sidechains Important?Sidechains help blockchains scale, develop and interact. Both Ethereum and Bitcoin require every node to validate new transactions, whereas in a sidechain, the sidechain network validates transactions and only periodically updates the root chain. This exponentially increases transaction throughput, without sacrificing decentralization or security. This massive boost to transactional capacity helps blockchains scale. Instead of the entire root chain (or 51% of it) validating transactions, sidechains take responsibility for validating their own. A sidechain has its own miners, validation nodes and only periodically reports back to the parent chain to update its status. This removes bottlenecks on the root chain and increases the speed and scalability of the whole network. Plasma: A Case StudyOne of Ethereum’s scaling solutions is called Plasma. Like Bitcoin sidechains, Plasma can transfer validation responsibilities from the root chain to a sidechain. This means each sidechain can be customized by a dApp, exchange or smart contract, each with its own trusted validation nodes.Let’s say you want to trade on our decentralized exchange, for example. If the Ethereum blockchain had to validate everything you do, it would be painfully slow and expensive. Plasma, on the other hand, processes your transactions off-chain, so they’re much faster and you don’t have to pay gas on every transaction. Plasma also lets you trigger a mass-exit mechanism if you discover foul play. Supply a Merkle proof of your state within the sidechain -- your ETH balance, for example -- and Plasma will revert to the last legitimate state that corresponds to your proof. This discourages theft and other fraud.Although Plasma is relatively new, there are several projects taking advantage of it. OmiseGO is developing Plasma as a framework for payments, and Loom Network is using Plasma to help developers create scalable dApps and games. ChallengesAlthough a worthy contender in the fight for scalable, dynamic blockchains, sidechains do present a number of challenges. First, opponents argue they’re not decentralized enough. Since they’re small, they’ll run fewer validation nodes, making it easier for a determined mining group to control the bulk of validation. Finding miners might also be a challenge, given that there is less incentive to mine in a sidechain when there are fewer transactions and therefore fewer rewards. One potential answer to this is merge mining, where miners validate blocks from different blockchains at the same time. The problem with merge mining is that, again, the largest mining pools will flourish and the smaller ones will flounder, risking a minority controlling most (or all) of the validation. Perhaps, then, sidechain projects could fund mining themselves or reward miners with transaction fees. Another possible answer might be using trusted federations, but again, this raises some uncomfortable questions about centralization. Sidechains are a promising solution to the scalability trilemma, and with advances in SPV proofs, the mining issue might disappear altogether. For the time being, however, there’s still quite a lot of work to be done."

It’s not that people won’t use digital coins, causing values to collapse and wiping out their investments; crypto fans believe that there will always be a demand for a digital currency that can be transferred immediately around the world and for negligible cost.Their worry is that everyone will use just one digital coin, causing values to collapse and wiping out investments in all their other coins.The concern is that the U.S. government, through the Federal Reserve, will release its own “FedCoin” and make it the only currency allowed for digital U.S. trade. That would be bad enough, but if the government pre-mined all those coins, it would also have the same control over the currency and its value that Federal Reserve can now exert over the dollar. It could peg its FedCoin to fiat, and with sole control of the blockchain, it might even be able to retroactively change entries in the blockchain, wiping out transactions and seizing assets.The dream of a decentralized global currency free of regulation and government interference, and powered only by its users, would have been crushed by the government juggernaut.As central banks, such as the Bank of England, have explored the possible role of the blockchain in the banking system, experts have looked at the issue of a government-issued FedCoin with varying degrees of curiosity, enthusiasm and fear.So far, those fears haven’t been realized. Central banks might be interested in the blockchain, but they have shown little willingness to create their own digital currencies. Recently, however, the day on which the financial system takes over cryptocurrencies might well have taken a step closer.In late September this year, Sean Neville and Jeremy Allaire of Circle, a fintech company, announced the release of USD Coin. The coin would be used to “tokenize U.S. dollars and use those dollars over public blockchains on the internet … Individuals and institutions can enroll in this service to deposit U.S. dollars from bank accounts, convert those dollars into tokens usable everywhere the internet reaches (subject to the token’s compliance controls), and redeem USDC tokens and cash out to bank accounts.”According to Circle, users have to be licensed to handle electronic money; have audited anti-money-laundering and compliance programs that meet Financial Action Task Force standards; back all tokens on a one-to-one USDC/USD basis; and meet reporting and review requirements established by CENTRE, the consortium created to distribute the coin.In effect, the company has created a new version of Tether, a digital currency pegged to the dollar.Like Tether, USDC attempts to solve cryptocurrency’s volatility problem. As long as a digital coin can jump or dive double-digit percentage points in a single day, businesses just aren’t going to use it. They won’t know what they should charge or how much they’ll receive. Pegging the value of a coin to the dollar gives that coin the value and stability of a greenback while still providing the mobility of a digital currency. A customer in China could send a USDC to a seller in Kansas who would receive the money instantaneously and be able to convert it into dollars at a known rate.So far so standard. Pegged digital currencies aren’t new, but what is new is that backing for Circle includes Goldman Sachs. This isn’t just another fintech company looking for a solution to cryptocurrency’s volatility problem. It’s a part of the banking industry showing a willingness to put its money into the creation of a digital coin.The rise of cryptocurrencies was always going to attract the attention of big fish. Regulators, from the FCC to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, have all shown an interest in tokens, coins and ICOs. Private equity and institutional investors are all wondering if this is the time to start putting in their own money.If a company like Goldman Sachs was to start using a type of FedCoin, the result might well be a very different cryptocurrency environment. The volumes with which big banking institutions trade would make the coin too big to ignore. It might be useful, but it would be centralized and entirely under the control of the big banks.Those fears, though, are likely to be overblown, and not just because CENTRE describes itself as “decentralized and independent.” The volatility that has held bitcoin back, and that a FedCoin hopes to solve, is shrinking. A 30-day estimate of just over 2% for USD/BTC might be high compared to other currency pairs, but it’s much lower than the double-digit rates that plagued the coin’s early years.Bitcoin still has some way to go. It’s still too unpredictable to function as an international digital currency. But as speculators have been shaken off, volumes have increased, and the number of coins in circulation has grown, so the coin’s volatility has been reduced. Bitcoin users have no reason to fear the rise of a FedCoin, whether it’s made by a Federal Reserve or a major banking institution. Instead, those institutions should be afraid of stable bitcoin."

In an interview with Forbes, Al-Naji explained what went wrong and how similar companies in the future could avoid his fate.“We met with the SEC to clarify a lot of our thinking,” said Al Naji, who previously worked at Google after graduating with honors from Princeton University. “The SEC generally avoids saying that something will definitely be one way or the other. But from that meeting we got the impression that we would not be able to avoid securities classification.”Sadly, Al Naji tells Forbes the Basis technology was nearly complete, and his company was mostly just waiting for a final green light from regulators before unleashing it into the world. Forbes named Al Naji to its 2019 30 Under 30 list of young entrepreneurs out to change the world.Instead, Intangible Labs, relying on what Al Naji calls a “return capital clause” in the white paper that first described the Basis technology, will return the venture capital to investors now that the regulatory climate has evolved against the company’s favor.When Intangible Labs first published its white paper in June 2017, the company described Basis as an “algorithmic central bank” that would give users a stable currency with which to conduct financial transactions around the world, similar to bitcoin but without the wild price swings experienced by other cryptocurrencies.By automatically buying back Basis tokens when their price dropped and minting new tokens when the price increased, the New Jersey startup believed it could create a new global currency. Specifically, on-chain auctions of ""bond"" and ""share"" tokens would be used to adjust the supply. This is different from most other stablecoins launched this year, which achieve stability by being backed by the U.S. dollar or another fiat currency.The company’s lawyers explained that the tokens would likely be deemed unregistered securities. Because of that, Intangible Labs would be responsible for limiting token ownership to accredited investors in the United States for the first year after issuance and for backgrounding international users. While many of the regulatory requirements would lapse after one year, a centralized ""white list"" would be required indefinitely. “I’ve very disappointed,” said Al Naji. “Returning capital is something I never wanted to have to do, and had the regulatory climate loosened rather than tightened it would have been amazing for our technology, and also for the people who would use it.”This is not the first time Intangible Labs was forced to change its plans due to regulatory requirements. Shortly after launching, the company moved from New York City to New Jersey, where Wall Street was still visible on the other side of the Hudson River but the company was at least technically out of reach of the state of New York’s burdensome BitLicense requirements.Ironically, the failure of such a promising young startup seeking regulatory permission comes only six months after an SEC director publicly stated that another high-profile cryptocurrency, ether, was likely an unregistered security when it launched but had evolved to be not a security. Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency that started it all, was launched without permission by an anonymous creator ten years ago.Ether serves as a fuel of sorts that powers the Ethereum network of decentralized applications, and other cryptocurrencies like filecoin are designed to compensate users for leasing out unused computing space. Meanwhile, Basis has no intrinsic utility and is a pure-play replacement for currency, according to Al-Naji.“Fundamentally, that lack of utility puts us on a different ground than ethereum or filecoin,” said Al Naji. “That puts us at a disadvantage in the existing regulatory framework.”While the total market value of bitcoin, ether, and all other major cryptocurrencies has taken a pummeling over the past year, falling about 80%, the fact that they exist at all is of note given what the end of Basis reveals about the strictness of the current regulatory climate.Going forward, Al Naji says that other entrepreneurs working to build a stable alternative to hyper-inflated fiat currencies should not found their companies in the United States, not raise money from U.S. investors, and ensure “that the token has some kind of consumable utility, which our token didn’t have.”For now, though, the Intangible Labs cofounder says existing stablecoins that rely on fiat backing but still give the speed and borderlessness of crypto “will actually do very well,” adding: “But it’s a disappointment that we can’t offer an alternative that doesn’t rely on trusting a centralized authority.”"

Bitcoin transactions can conduct 3-5 TPS (transactions-per-second), ...","Nov 23, 2018,03:30am EST",COTI logo,"The blockchain is changing with several new protocols currently being tested and which look to be changing the system as we know it. The latest incarnation is what is being termed as 'Blockchain 3.0'A new company called COTI has designed a new block-less and miner-less blockchain which they claim solves the scalability issue of cryptocurrencies and makes bitcoin look slightly backward. Cryptocurrencies were all were introduced to make payments cheaper, faster, secure and easier. Arguably, they’ve done anything but so.The time and money it takes for miners to confirm transactions mean that Bitcoin transactions can conduct 3-5 TPS (transactions-per-second), and Ethereum marginally better at 15 TPS. It's a clear problem if we expect millions to use cryptocurrencies for their everyday shopping. Not to mention the nightmare of wallet address, and the energy consumption to code.COTI has architected a new blockchain based on a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) protocol. DAG are block-less blockchains where there are no miners or blocks. Graphs are acyclic in nature and flow in a specific direction, which means that transactions cannot be duplicated and can confirm themselves automatically based on previous transactions. Therefore, there are no miners to spend time and charge fees to code to confirm transactions, allowing for virtually real-time and low-cost crediting of funds to the other party’s wallet.Plus, no miners means no coding and no energy consumption for computing. What's more, COTI will store user’s funds in ‘cold’ offline wallets, securing against the recent well documented cyber attacks.Therefore, unlike Bitcoin’s 3-5 TPS, COTI is able to process 10,000 TPS. It's bringing what works in the fiat world (i.e. instant payment processes) to the crypto world.COTI is a real business and has not gone through an ICO but has an operating platform with 80,000 users, 4,000 merchants, worth $15m+ already, and already being used on 250,000 POS terminals in shops across the world.Shahaf Bar-Geffen, CEO of COTICOTI is run by a team with considerable experience: Greg Kidd (early investor in Twitter, Square, Coinbase, Ripple), Steve Heilbron (CEO of Investec plc) and Dr. Matthew McBrady (CIO of Blackrock), as well as further executives from JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, UBS, KPMG and IBM.I spoke to Shahaf Bar-Geffen who is the CEO of COTI. As already explained, COTI has architected a new blockchain based on DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) data structure, called the Trustchain. DAG is block-less blockchains where there are no miners or blocks, allowing for virtually real-time and low-cost confirmation of transactions. Shahaf was also co-founder and CEO of WEB3, a digital media and advertising business.Could you provide an overview of how COTI works and how this is relevant in the light of Blockchain 3.0?""At COTI, we are building the world’s first blockchain protocol optimized for decentralized payments, designed for use by merchants, governments, decentralized payment networks, and stable coin issuers. Our DAG-based Trustchain protocol is the next evolution in the blockchain, a truly viable blockchain 3.0 solution that will be particularly fit for specialized use cases"".Geffen further states that decentralization is the future and that the Trustchain is the next generation blockchain 3.0 solution, which will bring the world one step closer to achieving the mass adoption of cryptocurrencies. """"Our vision is to digitize money and to improve the technology behind it. We see a future in which money is completely digitized and unbound with the limitations money has today"".How does COTI improve security for proof of work?""We achieve Trustchain protocol security in our network by introducing DSP (double spend prevention) Nodes and applying trust to every participant in the network. With COTI, double spending attacks are not possible at all, so we are much safer than any existing blockchain protocol.Most known solutions to the double spending problem are inefficient or centralized. Geffen claims that their DSP solution consists of adding a handful of highly trusted Nodes to the network with the primary function of reaching consensus on whether the transaction is legitimate or a double spend. When a transaction has more than one-half of the DSP Node signatures, then consensus is achieved.We take it a step further with the PoT (Proof of Trust) required to validate transactions. In the rare event where an attacker is capable of making many small transactions, the account’s Trust Score will decrease, causing an increase in the PoT required to create new transactions and by that blocking such an attack very quickly. Another possible way to launch a similar attack is to flood the network with invalid transactions using many user accounts. In COTI, such attempts will be met with little success because all transactions are verified by Full Nodes.What are the technical aspects of the coin and how are these game-changing in the space?""We’ve introduced a high-performance cryptocurrency built atop the base layer protocol. This cryptocurrency will be used as a common means of payment, including all fees and staking inside the COTI ecosystem. There can be voucher tokens, stable coins, dedicated tokens for global companies, or scalability tokens to speed up settlements in other blockchains.Geffen explains that their infrastructure will support a MultiDAG, which is a unique and innovative concept not available on other platforms and which can be used for various purposes and originators. They are also introducing on-chain DAG-based smart contracts, a unique solution that will enable the streamlined deployment of new tokens onto the network. All fees within the COTI ecosystem are paid with the COTI native coin. In this way, all applications and tokens supported on the infrastructure will increase native coin circulation and token value accordingly.""Our MultiDAG, together with our smart contracts and the possibility of multiple genesis transactions allows for the creation of high-performance stable coins. Most stable coins are essentially ERC-20 tokens, which make them hardly usable for everyday payments. For COTI, the situation is different, as high throughput, quick confirmations, and low fees enable the creation of highly usable stable coins with their own Cluster and confirmation rules"", Geffen added.Finally, what are the next steps for COTI?""To date, we have launched the Trustchain AlphaNet protocol, on chain KYC, the trust scoring mechanism and COTI Pay. We also have a lot more exciting developments coming up at COTI in the next few months. At the close of November, we’ll be releasing the COTI-X exchange and first white label solution, followed by the rollout of our Arbitration System during our TestNet release on 30 December, 2018. Smart contracts and POS integration will be implemented on the main net in Q2 2019"", Geffen concluded."

Downturn”",https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeldelcastillo/2018/12/11/defiant-winklevoss-brothers-expand-crypto-offering-we-can-weather-this-downturn/,"When the world first learned that Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss were bitcoin

The Winklevoss brothers then valued their holdings at around $11 million. Today, bitcoin’s forecast is hardly any better; it has lost 80% of its total value, down from its all-time-high of $19,000 to about $3,500 today. But it’s that relative price increase of 2,800%—and a number of other milestones—that the brothers think shows they’re on the right path.So, instead of holing up their forces for a brighter day, Tyler and Cameron now employ more people than ever and just moved to some fancy new Park Avenue offices. Instead of giving up after multiple failed attempts to get a bitcoin ETF license from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the brothers have changed tack and are launching their first mobile application and a new basket of cryptocurrencies. While the crypto industry is in many ways in retreat, the Winklevoss brothers are digging in.“We can weather this downturn,” said Gemini president, Cameron Winklevoss.The brothers say the mobile app is part of an expanded focus that has been in the works for months. In addition to letting existing customers set alerts and make purchases in any of Gemini’s five cryptocurrencies, the mobile app, which is available in Apple’s App Store and Google Play, lets new users initiate know-your-customer proceedings, including facial recognition and other biometric proofs using the mobile device camera.Also announced today, Gemini has launched the Cryptoverse basket, an investment vehicle available in the mobile app that consists of a mixture of bitcoin, ethereum, litecoin, zcash, and the recently added bitcoin cash—all of which have been added with approval by the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS)—weighted by market cap. To give an idea of exactly how rough the cryptocurrency market is that the brothers are launching these products into, the overall market cap has declined from its peak of $817 billion in January 2018 to $110 billion today. Collectively, the market caps of all five of the cryptocurrencies Gemini now trades have declined about 78% from about $356 billion in December 2018 to $75 billion today.Nevertheless, the brothers remain undaunted, focusing steadfastly on their belief that the underlying blockchain technology will lay the foundation for a new, less-centralized financial infrastructure.“For many years when we were building Gemini, price wasn’t a thing. Bitcoin was a $200 coin,” said Cameron. “Then, last year is actually an anomaly, and almost, you could argue, a distraction.” While a representative of Gemini declined to share how much cryptocurrency the brothers currently owned, or even if they owned any, in 2016 they confirmed they had a “material” stake in ether, according to a CoinDesk report. The launch of the Gemini mobile app may seem like a long-overdue achievement, given that U.S. competitors like Coinbase and Kraken launched their mobile apps in October 2013 and September 2014, respectively. But Gemini has been focused largely on building out a financial infrastructure targeting institutions first, trusting a more organic approach in order to attract retail investors.To give some perspective, while Coinbase received its banking charter only in October 2018 and Kraken still operates without a charter, which limits the kinds of business it can legally conduct, Gemini won its charter from the NYDFS all the way back in October 2015. Following multiple failed attempts to obtain another license from the SEC to offer a bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund (ETF), the launch of a mobile app signals an expanded interest in specifically targeting retail investors.“You’re going to see that the product story and the individual customer narrative is going to be a bigger part of 2019,” said Tyler Winklevoss, Gemini’s chief executive officer, who joined his brother, speaking with Forbes at the company's new three-floor offices. Gemini declined to share customer numbers, but to give an idea of growth, the firm has doubled in size over the past year, according to a representative, and employs almost 200 people at the new 50,000-square-foot location.While such a hiring trajectory flies in the face of developments at some crypto firms like ethereum incubator ConsenSys, which has had difficulty over the downturn and plans to lay off as much as 13% of its staff, it aligns with a Glassdoor report that showed a 300% increase in crypto jobs year over year. The blockchain-focused Web3 Foundation, tells Forbes it doubled its staff this quarter exclusively with crypto-related hires and will continue to make key hires into next year.“While some capital might be leaving the market,” Cameron acknowledged, “the human capital is really impressive, and it’s long-term capital. People don’t make decisions to enter crypto on a month-to-month or price-to-price basis.”Free Webcast: Join Forbes crypto expert Jack Tatar on December 18 at 2 p.m. EST and find out what you can expect from bitcoin and other crypto assets in 2019 as well as which companies are benefiting from blockchain technology.

The integration of more advanced software tools for trading with progress in machine learning and decentralised exchanges (DEXs) should further expand on the development of trading bots in the industry. Despite the rise of algorithmic trading in cryptocurrency markets, it is still a nascent field with a substantial amount of improvement and discovery waiting to unfold. The future of exchanges and the interoperability of blockchain networks is still unclear at this point, but trading bots should remain a vital tool for traders and institutions to minimize risk and execute large orders efficiently. Many trading bots during the meteoric rise of the cryptocurrency market last year focused on arbitrage trading between exchanges. Premiums on South Korean exchanges for Bitcoin reached nearly 30 percent in December of last year, compared to US-based exchanges. With such enormous spreads, it was only natural that trading bots emerged for taking advantage of exchange arbitrage.The unreal arbitrage spreads coincided with a general market trend of Bitcoin and altcoins exploding in price. As a result, trading bots became popular tools for automated trading in 24/7 markets that seemingly only increased in volumes and prices. Bots allow traders to successfully trade and monitor their positions using customizable parameters without having to be glued to their screens the entire time. Further, the human emotional error aspect and an inability to compete with bots in the concurrent monitoring of assets on multiple exchanges has led to their further proliferation in the industry. The disparate regional regulatory frameworks for cryptocurrencies and exchanges expanded on the ability to capitalize on arbitrage spreads due to predictable arbitrage opportunities and market inefficiencies. Market anomalies and manipulation continue to persist in the industry too, leading to discrepancies that bots can potentially capitalize on or assist with investor protection to negative exposure. Trading bots are also used for improper practices. The Wall Street Journal recently identified instances of spoofing across the markets, while Virgil Capital revealed that they use their own bots to combat “enemy” bots in the market. Interestingly, some traders view the unregulated markets and subsequent manipulation with trading bots as useful, allowing small investors to use sophisticated trading tools that level the playing field. Further complications in cryptocurrency markets come in the form of direct manipulation by influential participants. The Blockchain Transparency Institute recently reported that over 67 percent of daily trading volume among the top 130 cryptocurrency exchanges is wash trading, accounting for over $6 billion per day. Such discrepancies are difficult to identify by traders and even harder to protect against. Slippage is also rampant in cryptocurrency markets. Recent slippage research conducted by Sylvain Ribes concluded that inflated exchange volumes and wash trading had led to some astounding metrics, with some discrepancies in slippage revealing fabricated volumes as high as nearly 93 percent on some exchanges. It is worth noting that Ribes defines slippage in his study as the percentage change between mid-spread price and the lowest price he had to consent to sell the asset. Revelations such as Ribes’ indicate the opaqueness of many influential participants in the cryptocurrency market ecosystem, leading to an entirely unprecedented medium for trading bots to work within, with some likely contributing to wash trading. The future impact of trading bots is also significant considering how the landscape of digital asset markets may look in several years with decentralized exchanges, DAOs, and AI analytics tools. The prevalence of trading bots in cryptocurrency markets does not come without limitations, however. Many trading tools are purely targeting professional traders with extensive experience and are too sophisticated for mainstream investors. Moreover, there is no standard API for exchanges and using bots for market making is challenging in low volume environments, as is common with many smaller cryptocurrency exchanges and DEXs.  Trading bots in cryptocurrency markets tend to have a substantially high barrier to their use. Open-source trading tools require knowledge of programming languages to tweak them to meet specific needs effectively, and the interfaces tend to be highly advanced. Entrants to the cryptocurrency space are thus unlikely to use these tools, leaving a gap in the playing field to adequately navigate and protect themselves from harmful exposure. Algorithmic trading tools are also primarily relegated to localized programs that need to be downloaded and hosted on a user’s computer. As a result, users need to keep their computer running 24/7 in step with the cryptocurrency markets, leaving their viability dependent on their Internet connection and requiring manually installed updates. The increasing realization of the sheer amount of data available and waiting to be uncovered in cryptocurrency markets has brought new tools for investors. Built with innovative machine learning algorithms, social media indicators, and user-friendly interfaces, a new class of trading bots is set to have a sizeable impact on the growth of the market. Bots are progressively becoming more intelligent, integrating diverse data feeds and real-time indicators as well as enabling enhanced customization to meet trading preferences. Trading bots are beginning to overcome some of their current limitations too, particularly in regards to targeting more mainstream investors with simpler interfaces and more conservative trading protections. Some better known trading bot in the industry are Gekko, an open source bot and a straightforward tool for investors, Zenbot, which is a little bit more comprehensive than Gekko, and Cryptohopper, which offers advanced bots with intuitive user interface. The latter is also the first solution to incorporate crypto signalers (where experts share investment suggestions based on predictive machine learning.)Trading bots will continue to evolve in cryptocurrency markets to meet trading needs. Especially once institutional investment starts entering the markets and the volatility and risks of manipulations are reduced, trading bots should begin to flourish with advanced AI and machine learning components. That said, as crypto is in a tragic low these days in terms of public trust, it's also safe to stay patient and wait for the market to stabilize before making any investment decisions. "

And, of course, another cryptocurrency.","And yet, look where we are.Bitcoin and Ethereum are free-falling in value. Proof of work has been exposed as an environmental catastrophe. In spite of numerous efforts to improve blockchain scalability to something approaching Visa's or Mastercard's ability to manage transactions, we've seen varying levels of success in shipping products.Blockchain, Network Server, Technology, Bitcoin, BiometricsAnd while there have been some bright spots of innovation using blockchain in actual real live working applications like this crypto REIT in South Carolina and IBM/Walmart's food safety project, much of the innovation in the crypto space has been of the financial shell game type, and not the kind lawmakers like.And about that food safety project ... can anyone say ROMAINE LETTUCE?So it's pretty clear to me that we're in desperate need of blockchain innovation that is scalable, eco-friendly, and most importantly of all, addresses real business and social needs.A smart college professor friend of mine in the Netherlands thinks that Devv, which bills itself as ""the enterprise blockchain,"" might just be it. So I interviewed Devv's CEO, Tom Anderson, who has a refreshingly real background in actual tech, shipping product, and making good old-fashioned USD.He thinks Devv has solved the biggest issues blockchain has: scalability, stability, security, fraud/theft, and privacy ... all at a tiny fraction of the cost of Ethereum transactions.Here's our interview:Koetsier: What is Devv? Tom Anderson: Devv is both a blockchain protocol and a cryptocurrency. The Devv blockchain is the fastest and most scalable blockchain in the world. It is primarily addressing scalability, cost, stability, fraud/theft/loss, and privacy. Devv is unique in our sharding solution (we have recently benchmarked at over 8 million transactions per second, which is arguably the fastest blockchain in the world), our privacy solution which is meant to work within government regulation, our fraud/theft/loss protection capabilities, our efficient and inexpensive Smart Contract solution (using Smart Coins), and our stable coin implementation. Devv is the only blockchain to solve all of blockchain’s biggest challenges in a single solution.Blockchain as a field will be as significant to society as the Internet has been. I think many people have heard the hype, but they don’t really understand why blockchain will be so significant. The fundamental reason is that blockchain allows trustless transactions. It’s not more complicated than that - but why is that important, and what does that really mean? Transactions that are trustless do not rely on someone (in blockchain terms, a central authority) to say they are valid. Your bank wire transfer goes through because your bank approves it, using their internal records on their internal databases. Your Visa payment goes through because Visa approves it. Your medical records, internet search history, DNA test results, friend’s lists, music purchases, etc. all are held by companies that profit off of that data and its use. Imagine a world where you don’t have to trust those companies to hold your data. Imagine a world where there is an infrastructure where anyone can exchange any type of value, directly. Just like it was for the Internet during the mid 90’s, it is hard right now to really envision what impact trustless computing will hold, but it is a fundamental shift in how many things will be done.A broader answer, then, to ""What is Devv?"" is that we intend for it to be the world’s infrastructure for transferring value. It is only when a blockchain solves all of the problems we solve, in a single solution, that it can fulfill that vision.Koetsier: Why does the world need another blockchain technology?Tom Anderson: I’m going to answer this question second, as the story of how we got started is a good foundation for what we’re doing, and why (and why the world needs us).I come out of the tech industry, and I am an experienced entrepreneur. In my last company, a robotics company, I raised over $34 million, took the company public, created the world’s first consumer 3D Touch robotic controller, got national retail distribution, and licensed on the order of $100 million of video game software that we sold with our hardware. Ultimately, we sold our IP to Facebook. The reason I mention that, is I think I have a different mentality and viewpoint for the crypto space than many who are currently in the space. I came into the space, and didn’t just accept all of the wild concepts that many accept as innate to the industry.When I first got into the blockchain space we were looking to leverage some intellectual property. We initially created plans for a cryptocurrency that could be used in a developer store (thus the name of our blockchain - we kept a variation of the name as a nod to the folks who are really creating things - developers!). However, when I first started looking at blockchain technologies in detail, I saw there were gaping holes in how things are done.These are the same issues that anyone wanting to grow a real business in the blockchain space, will face.All of these concepts seem to me to be basic common business sense, but almost none of it is how the blockchain industry works right now. When we looked at the space, like any real business will do, there were no solutions on which one can build a real business.Therefore, we designed a protocol to solve all of these issues.I feel we have the best technology in the space. To answer the question of ""Why does this solution exist?"" ... it is because the world desperately needs it. Whether it is us or someone else, it will surely be an approach that solves all of these problems, that will become the leader in the DLT space.Given our IP and lead time on many of these areas, our experienced team, and our long-term vision, I believe it will be us.Koetsier: How are you planning to use it? Tom Anderson: We plan to be THE Enterprise blockchain solution. Many different organizations will be able to implement their blockchain needs on our platform. The single biggest driver for large corporations is going to be cost, and we are very strong there.We expect we will cost on the order of 1/100,000th of Ethereum, to implement our smart contracts. Other factors like our consensus algorithms and governance, fraud/theft/loss protections, and our privacy solution, as examples, will be very appealing to enterprise use as well.Really, you have to have a solution that works with features that people are accustomed to, to compete.Koetsier: What is the theoretical maximum processing speed?Tom Anderson: Devvio has solved the sharding problem, a large area of research in blockchain technology. We scale horizontally, meaning that in order to scale we simply add more shards. Each shard is an independent blockchain, so we can add as many shards as needed.The complexity comes from having transactions move between shards, and this is the clever aspect of our solution. We have what we call a Wallet Designation, where every wallet is assigned one and only one shard. Then we separate payment and settlement.We have one shard (which we call our Tier 1 network) that works differently than the rest. It collects all of the blocks from all of the other shards (Tier 2 networks), adds them to its blocks, and then all of the T2’s handle settlement from the T1 blocks.We haven’t yet reached a theoretical maximum in scaling this way, but we will be able to process over 10 million transactions per second on-chain on a public, global blockchain, using the designs we currently have working. It is a very scalable design, not only in throughput, but also by geography and use.Koetsier: How does it differ from standard blockchain technology? Tom Anderson: The vast majority of blockchain projects have been focused either on a particular application area (cryptocurrency, supply chain, gambling, identity, etc), or on solving one or two of the main challenges in the space (privacy, scalability, smart contracts, etc.). There are no approaches, other than Devvio’s, where the solution was designed to address all of blockchain’s challenges in a single solution.Additionally, the majority of projects have accepted some base assumptions that originated with Bitcoin’s design, but which are not absolutes and which create a solution space in which it is very difficult to solve problems. Many projects still have a naïve belief and design where blockchains will overcome any type of government regulation, based on the field’s cypherpunk roots. Governance is a significant problem in blockchain, and even projects specifically targeted at governance are unproven.Another example are the problems of fraud, theft, and loss. Nearly everyone in the blockchain industry simply accepts those problems as unsolvable, because blockchains are immutable. However, Devvio has shown that one can have an immutable blockchain that still implements clever designs to address those issues.A blockchain approach that solves all of the field’s biggest problems in a single solution is critical to the success and growth of blockchain as an industry, and Devvio is the first to do so.We have the fastest blockchain in the world. We have the least expensive smart contract system. We have a solution for fraud, theft, and loss. We have a privacy solution that will work within government regulation. We have a stable coin that can be implemented within KYC and AML constraints. It is not until one has solved ALL of these problems that blockchain can truly fulfill its potential and become a world changing technology.Koetsier: You have a currency built on Devv as well... when are you planning to launch that? Tom Anderson: We will launch the Devv cryptocurrency when we launch or live version 1 production blockchain. We expect to do so in early 2019.We have already created our genesis block for Devv (and included some easter eggs in it, including a note that says ""Thank you Satoshi"" -- Bitcoin showed us the way, and I feel we will take the baton).Koetsier: Why would people adopt it versus Bitcoin or Ethereum?Tom Anderson: Our solution does the things one needs to do, to truly have blockchain become what we all want it to become.It’s just not realistic for mass use, enterprise use, and institutional use if a blockchain doesn’t scale, if there is massive theft with no recourse, if there is no privacy solution that governments will accept, and if the price of a cryptocurrency is extremely volatile.Again, coming from the tech space, this is just common business sense. Additionally, in the case of Ethereum, Ethereum has too many fatal flaws. It is a brilliant project, and like Bitcoin, showed us the way, but it is not a practical solution for the future. Cost alone will make Ethereum unusable in enterprise use.Koetsier: Talk about smart contracts on Devv. Is that implemented, or part of what you’re planning to implement? Tom Anderson: I am very excited about our smart contract solution, which we implement with a concept called Smart Coins. There are two things that blockchain does well, and only two things: robustness and trustlessness.If you want to use blockchain, you should need both of those concepts. If not, you’re better off using a traditional database.We designed our Smart Coin approach around that philosophy. I think having a Turing complete Smart Contract solution is an enormous mistake. Don’t get me wrong – our solution is built on C++ which is Turing Complete, so we can implement anything that we need to, but having it where anyone can implement anything on a decentralized blockchain leads to a network that is not scalable and not secure.I believe our solution will be received by the community similar to how Ethereum was received – I feel people will be very excited by the concept.We have designed our Smart Coin approach, submitted a great deal of information on them in our patents, and are currently implementing our first Smart Coins.Koetsier: How do you plan to make it a standard or default? Tom Anderson: I think one of our biggest strengths is in the problems we solve for those looking to build real businesses on the blockchain. We create solutions that actually enable many businesses that are otherwise not possible, and I think that alone will create a lot of buzz and help us to establish our solution.Perhaps more importantly, though, we have a lot of business development and corporate development experience on our team. Our President, Ray Quintana, has many contacts in the global 500, and they are very interested in our solutions. Our team is very experienced across the board, so building relationships with other companies will be one of our real strengths.

will suddenly start taking Bitcoin when the risks are seen as even higher.","Nov 20, 2018,03:56am EST","A customer makes a chip and pin payment with a Visa Inc. credit card at a restaurant in London, U.K.... [+] Will these card machines soon be outdated and obsolete? Photographer: Simon Dawson/Bloomberg","Payment, for goods and services, is something that has been going on since the dawn of humanity. The only change has been how it has been enacted. From bartering to cryptocurrencies, methods of payment have changed dramatically throughout human history, and we are in the midst of another wave of change.Many will feel that cryptocurrencies are the catalyst for the newest payment revolution, but those predictors are probably getting ahead of themselves. Although crypto certainly works for new and different payment methods, it is embryonic compared to the real latest trend.Payment apps and portals are where the future of money and payment are heading. Not only is it the convenience, but it is also the added uses that can come from an app that is driving this new wave of adoption.Austin Kimm, COO of Crypterium, a cryptocurrency wallet that is aware of the advancing of payment possibilities, notes how the change in payment options differs around the world, and in different markets.“It is possible that these payment apps will replace cards and cash, but different technologies will be successful in different markets,” said Kimm. “In China payments are now dominated by WeChat and Alipay, QR readers that when combined are now much more significant than cards or cash. What is unique is there is no restriction to younger more tech-savvy users, but reaches all age groups.""Luckily for cryptocurrency enthusiasts, there is a growing trend for these types of payment apps to embrace and enhance, their offerings with cryptocurrencies, creating a symbiotic relationship. The fact that payment apps offer cryptocurrency investing and spending opens up their market to a growing number of people, and at the same time, these apps are normalising and helping adoption of cryptocurrencies into the mainstream market.So where does the short to mid-term future of payments lie? Cryptocurrencies will play their part, but their future is probably more long-term than the age of the payment app. More so, what will payment apps and portals look like? for in today’s market, one function is not nearly enough.The new generation, the more generationEven in today’s world, one can notice a change that has been making its final moves. Cash is slowing being phased out for more virtual forms of currency. Money can now be stored on a plastic card with its digital links to the bank and payments made with relative ease at brick and mortar vendors, as well as online.The virtual payment portals set up through banks, and backed up with credit and debit cards, allows for much more ease of payment, and efficiency; it is something that has developed due to an increasing digital demand.But as the digital demands of people advance, so do the payment offerings. China’s WeChat is an example of a payment system that started as one thing and has moved with the times to embrace a different way of making payments.“WeChat started with the 'lucky money' or red packets when friends and family send money as a gift, and this then spread to practically all forms of payments,” Kimm goes on to explain. “But what makes WeChat unique, in addition to its 1 billion daily users, is that they are much more than just a payments solution, you can do practically everything in everyday life through their platform, from booking a doctors appointment to ordering a meal.""“It is possible that this path will not be the repeated in other markets, but it appears that a dedicated payments solution needs to do much more than just payments. As people become more comfortable with the services then these service's popularity will increase, but to make the step so that they become the de facto payment solution, it is very likely that the service needs to be much more than payments; there has to be a use case beyond payments.”Cash has always been limited by the fact that it can only function in one instance; between parties that are present. Card payments changed that by allowing users not necessarily to be present when making payments, and of course, digitalising the whole matter.What Kimm is stating is correct, the draw of payment apps, much like the smartphones they operate off, is their multifunctionality.A cryptocurrency offeringCryptocurrencies, as still very much a misunderstood form of payment, get their foot in the door thanks to payment apps and their multifunctionality. Apps, such as Circle, Square, and even Revolut, have integrated cryptocurrency buying and selling, as well as spending in some instances, to attract new, savvy, customers to their portals.It again goes back to the multifunctionality for people can not only use their standard virtual cash to buy and pay, but they can also invest and follow the cryptocurrency markets all in one app.For the app creators, they are hitting the right notes by allowing cryptocurrencies, which are still very nascent, to attract a new type of user. But they are also doing a huge favour to the general cryptocurrency market as these digital tokens are being compared to something very similar to virtual cash.“While the hype surrounding cryptocurrencies is intensifying in the financial service sector, now is too early for any immediate practical usage of cryptocurrency on a mass scale. Still, some forward-thinking banks and financial services have recognised the value of blockchain,"" Richard Yao, Senior Associate of Strategy and Content, IPG Media Lab, explains how, in a slightly different manner, through the example of XRP, cryptocurrencies are being used to entice new business, but also to normalise what could be the next, next, wave of payment possibilities.“While the hype surrounding cryptocurrencies is intensifying in the financial service sector, now is simply too early for any immediate practical usage of cryptocurrency on a mass scale,” he says bluntly. “Still, some forward-thinking banks and financial services have recognised the value of blockchain, the underlying technology powering cryptocurrencies, and started to incorporate elements of blockchain distributed network design to revamp their services.“For example, more than 100 banks have signed up with Ripple, to transform cross-border transfers with blockchain. AmEx is piloting a blockchain-based loyalty program with Boxed to offer more personalised rewards for customers.”Kimm also adds that with increased adoption, and use-cases, especially when it comes to spending, there will be a higher drive in the use of cryptocurrencies as a currency. However, the transition for people accepting cryptocurrencies will be critical, and it will likely be a bit of a process.“Cryptocurrency and payments are tied at the hip. For Cryptocurrency to be mainstream, there needs to be a daily use case, which in the long run means you must be able to spend it. The more you can spend it the more people will be willing to accept it. At the start that spend will more often than not require a transition from crypto to traditional money. Retailers, employees will not be willing to accept the transfer cost themselves or accept the currency fluctuation risk. Try spending Euro's in New York, and you will not get far, so there is no reason to assume they will suddenly start taking Bitcoin when the risks are seen as even higher. So payment companies have a role in facilitating this transition,” Kimm said.Exchanging paymentsIf payment apps do have the current inside lane while cryptocurrency payment options are still mulled and explored, then one has to wonder what these cryptocurrency exchanges and payment solutions will look like in the future.Kimm has already explained the success of multifunctionality, and for cryptocurrency wallets and exchanges, this is the next step due to the nature of digital currencies and the entire digital realm they occupy.“One or two exchanges will simply be the best exchange they can be,” Kimm said, predicting the future of cryptocurrency-based payment solutions. “But most will expand by building an ecosystem of additional services, such as investment management tools or safe storage, and many will move towards other exchange services such as remittance payments or daily transactions in everyday life.""“We are offering crypto buying, selling, sending and spending, even borrowing and a stock exchange system ; there is a lot that people want their money to be able to do. I believe that very few companies will be successful by just being a great exchange, so the route to success for most will be to build an ecosystem that people need for everyday life.”Moving forwardThe way in which people are making payments has been continuously evolving as new wants and needs emerge from the population. The path to mass adoption and acceptance always varies, but what is good to see is the potential of cryptocurrencies are being pushed by a payment method that has already made great strides to be the immediate future - payment apps.Cryptocurrencies are almost ahead of their time, and there needs to be a stop gap - which can integrate with their possibilities - before there is a real adoption of cryptocurrencies for payments. If cash apps can do that, while offering cryptocurrency options in their multifunctional mandate, then the path for crypto payment adoption is already laid out."

[+] the flag concept. lovely summer landscape with mountain in the distance","The past 2 years have been a rollercoaster for this industry. Prices went up, media showed interest, thousands of new startups popped out of nowhere and the ICO craze started. Then, market declined, people lost money and many have eventually abandoned the ship.Access to cryptocurrencies has come a long way from the early days when only mining, sketchy exchanges, Craigslist-like local meetups, and third-party custodial services with little transparency were available for purchasing some Bitcoin. Recently, a flurry of developments in e-commerce services, physical exchange locations and relatively user-friendly mobile apps have altered the dynamic and are helping to reduce the barriers to entering the era of digital assets. Cryptocurrency exchanges have provided liquidity to the cryptocurrency industry that would otherwise not be available without them. However, numerous problems stem from the current and former cryptocurrency exchange landscape, that have negatively impacted the further mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies.Despite recent decelerations that every cryptocurrency will be counted as a security, the public is still feeling an uncertainty whether to the question of utility vs. security. To put into perspective, here is a short timeline of events that might contribute to this fatigue:Exchanges in the U.S. that function as fiat on-ramps are required to undergo KYC/AML procedures, something that many users are uncomfortable with since it typically requires scanning your ID, and sending it to the exchange along with other personal information. While this will likely continue regardless of new regulations, reports like the recent New York Office of the Attorney General report that claim poor exchange protections against market manipulation, do not help alleviate current concerns over investor protection. The public worry of leaving funds in exchanges is compounded by persistent hacks of massive sums that have become endemic in the industry. Moreover, local meetups between sellers on P2P exchanges like LocalBitcoins have been cracked down on, even in the U.S. Out of the problems that traditionally restricted access to digital assets emerged a wave of tools and solutions to connect the mainstream to the burgeoning industry, particularly over the last year. Some of them have also launched services to help merchants accept cryptocurrencies, which also encourages adoption in a way.Coinbase - the dominant U.S. digital asset exchange - has launched its Coinbase Commerce service earlier this year. Coinbase Commerce helps online merchants and vendors easily integrate cryptocurrency payments into their offerings.Investing applications like Robinhood and Circle have also recently joined the cryptocurrency field as they integrate digital assets into their offerings. Circle offers both an investment and payment app with popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin through an intuitive interface. Robinhood offers their own commission-free cryptocurrency investment app that enables crypto asset trading side by side with traditional financial assets like stocks and ETFs. According to a recent report on cryptocurrency ATMs, the sector is pegged to reach $144.5 million in value by 2023. Two-way functionality ATM services are projected to grow faster, as they represent more convenient avenues for exchanging fiat-to-crypto and crypto-to-fiat than traditional methods.Bitcoin Depot offers crypto ATMs in neighborhoods where people can directly buy and sell cryptocurrencies for cash using their previous wallet addresses, or using the App. Their ATMs offer to buy and sell Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ether, and Litecoin. There are still several significant hurdles that need to be overcome for cryptocurrency adoption to hit the mainstream genuinely. Digital assets are mainly still used for speculation rather than their utility, and there is a substantial gap in their understanding by the general public. However, developments that promote wider adoption of digital assets are becoming more common and user-friendly each day. The continual improvement upon the existing structures of access serves as an excellent example of just how far the industry has come."

[+] Lympo launching the first fitness app utilizing blockchain technology.,"[Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.]Blockchain and specifically cryptocurrencies captivated the world throughout 2017 and attracted a lot of new consumers interested in the space.  The opposite, however, has mainly been the case in 2018 as the major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum have lost 80-90% of their overall value.  Despite the unfavorable price action, innovation in the space has continued to forge ahead and last week a familiar name in the sports and technology space made his latest investment, as Mark Cuban launched the “nation’s first” blockchain fitness app with partner Lympo. Cuban, the Dallas Mavericks owner, has been a serial entrepreneur since he sold his first startup, Broadcast.com, to Yahoo in 1999 for $5.7 billion. Despite the sale occurring almost 20 years ago, it remains the largest investment Yahoo ever made and, miraculously, exceeds the $4.4 billion that telecommunications giant Verizon paid to acquire Yahoo itself last year.Cuban is always looking for the next big opportunity and it is clear he sees blockchain falling in that category.  Earlier this year he was part of an investment in cryptocurrency hedge fund 1confirmation and Unikrn Gold, a virtual currency used for betting on sports and gaming events. His latest project is an app self-titled Lympo after their partner, is designed to be a cryptocurrency token intended to incentivize users to lead healthier lifestyles by rewarding such behavior. Cuban, along with Lympo Co-Founder Antanas Guoga, has said that the application will be the first to directly incentivize and reward exercise with a token that provides monetary value and not just speculative value. Gamification has been much more common in attempts by startups to attract users and Lympo will use this method to reward potential users with cryptocurrency tokens as they complete walking and running challenges that will be displayed on the website.The token will have the title “LYM” utility token and will be exchangeable for goods that can be valued in fiat currency. With many current cryptocurrencies being traded and exchanged for other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, it is a step forward in the space to have a potentially niche token that directly provides fiat currency value on its own. Users will be able to exchange their accrued LYM tokens for sports and fitness products in the Lympo Shop, which will be available on the app. It is being billed as the “first online store” that will accept the tokens as payment. The app anticipates that a broader range of items will eventually be available in the store, such as personal training sessions, gym memberships and plans for users to keep on their diet and exercise routines. The Ethereum blockchain-based token, while exchangeable for goods and services, can also be traded on a number of exchanges listed on the Lympo website and therefore is still susceptible to the very volatile conditions of the very green cryptocurrency market. The crypto space has been quite negative, so I love doing things when people give up., said Guoga. ""That’sthe best time to be in this industry. I love it. We’re doing it at a tough time. It’s very difficult to convince people. But that’s the best thing about it all. If something is easy and everybody is getting into it, it’s not that rewarding. These are tough times in this industry, but health apps are booming. So, within our own space, if we’re successful at what we’re trying to achieve, it’s going to be absolutely massive.""While the feature isn’t yet available, Lympo is planning to eventually provide an option to sync data with fitness and health trackers which will then be able to offer personalized health and fitness advice to users of the platform. While the transaction at hand isn’t readily out in the open, the way the platform will work for both parties is users selling their fitness data in and return receiving LYM tokens. “Lympo is all about making positive changes by taking small steps towards a more active lifestyle,” said Cuban. “Lympo doesn’t require you to drastically change your daily habits, but it’s a great incentive to gain real rewards, like Mavs tickets and gear, for fitness efforts.”With Lympo in the early stages of its development, it is looking for partners to build its ecosystem by promising opportunities for partner businesses to build awareness through sponsored challenges, while offering their product/services as a reward on the platform. Their efforts will certainly be aided with the Mavericks already in the fold as a partner and being able to provide challenges on the platform that will soon be exchanged for Mavericks prizes such as tickets to games or team merchandise.Cuban is also not the only big name in the sports industry throwing support behind the project. Professional tennis player Caroline Wozniacki and world champion discus thrower Andrius Gudzius have also partnered with the project and users were able to get rewards for finishing the Vilnius Marathon earlier this year in Lithuania.So far, their efforts to break into the very crowded space of sports and fitness technology seem promising. Securing the Mavericks as a strategic partner and Mark Cuban as a backer gives the company a big head start, providing opportunities that most companies of its size couldn't afford. That said, there,s lots of work ahead to make Lympo viable and it remains to be seen how eager users will be to earn the LYM tokens, given the very small percentage of the population currently familiar and trading cryptocurrencies. For complete information on the LYM token and project, the white paper is available here.Forbes contributor Mike Buteau contributed to this story. This article’s contents do not represent an endorsement of the LYM token. The cryptocurrency markets are extremely volatile and any individual thinking of investing should consult with a financial professional before doing so. "

These are mushrooming like there's no tomorrow and probably it will only be a matter of time before the SEC in the US will turn its attention to this class of digital assets.It is quite obvious that the days of regulatory uncertainty when regulators and governments around the globe were only trying to understand the concept of cryptocurrencies, let alone the legal frameworks according to which they should be regulated, are long gone. One by one, the U.S. financial regulators seems to be figuring out how to classify and, by extension, how to regulate cryptocurrencies. Perhaps the most fearsome of all regulators for the cryptocurrency community, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, is waging an all-out war on dozens of ICOs at this very moment. About a month ago, they settled charges against Zachary Coburn, the founder of EtherDelta, over operating an unregistered securities exchange. The total amount fined was almost $400,000. That same month, the SEC fined two startups $250,000 each for not registering their ICOs as securities offerings. Airfox and Paragon Coin Inc. were also ordered to return all the money they raised – $15 and $12 million respectively – to their investors. This was the first action of such magnitude SEC has ever taken against a cryptocurrency company and it was based on the regulator’s 2017 report which basically classified ERC-20 tokens as digital securities. Technically, that includes ether too. This means that ethereum and all the startups that created their tokens on the Ethereum platform will now have to fully comply with SEC’s regulations, apply for an exemption or face dire consequences. The SEC’s 2018 report already mentions ‘dozens’ of ongoing investigations, so virtually any startup that recently had an ICO is probably currently being investigated by the regulator. As of right now, SEC can only impose fines and nothing else, but many experts seem to agree on a wider cryptocurrencies crackdown being inevitable. When it comes to bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies based on bitcoin’s source code, the situation is slightly different. Several court cases in the U.S. this year set the precedent of altcoins and bitcoin being viewed as commodities, which brings them under the jurisdiction of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Just to hammer the point home, when Wall Street investment funds launched bitcoin futures trading, the CFTC posted a customer advice notice, where they clearly stated that bitcoin is a commodity and it will be regulated as such. Clearly, regulators were keen to finally put bitcoin and ICOs – the poster children of the cryptocurrency world – into an appropriate regulatory framework for various reasons. Classifying bitcoin as a commodity clearly means that most other cryptocurrencies can be classified and regulated as such while obliging ICOs to register as securities offerings is an obvious step toward the protection of investors and their funds. Frankly, everyone should’ve seen this coming – too many scammy ICOs took off with too much investors’ money over the last several years.Stasis Gregory Klumov and Maltese PM Joseph MuscatThe chances are that stablecoins are next. Gregory Klumov, the CEO of tokenization platform STASIS—which was behind much of the Maltese legal framework for digital assets—argues that new regulatory approaches are a must for this emerging asset class: “When cars were disrupting horses 100 years ago, humanity did not have a clue about what speed limits to impose on drivers, so people were given rights to experiment and figure it out.” .Klumov added that the STASIS Foundation continues to develop institutional-friendly infrastructure to tokenize assets. Its flagship product EURS more than doubled its amount in circulation and monthly transactions in November with third-party custody and frequent verifications will be joining the ecosystem shortly.We also spoke to a number of stable coin officials on their projects and how, in their different ways, they are changing the cryptocurrency markets as well as what they expect in 2019.Ken Lang, ndau Collective Member and CTO of COSIMO Venturesndau is a buoyant digital currency, built by Oneiro, to optimize long-term store of value and assets which are supported by a decentralized ecosystem. Unlike stablecoins, ndau is not pegged to fiat currencies or commodities, allowing for more desirable characteristics for long-term holders in particular.The story of ndau starts about five years ago, when an anonymous group of early bitcoin enthusiasts and experts — now called the ndau Collective — saw that blockchain and Bitcoin had a big future, but a few barriers holding it back from being all that it could be. Some of these largest barriers were volatility, dependability, and governance. They eventually decided that all of these issues were fixable, and this led to the development of ndau.“Some of these solutions came in the form of built-in economic structures to incentivize holding assets for a long period of time. One structure is called the Ecosystem Alignment Incentive (EAI), that rewards holders with additional ndau based on the duration of their holding time. There’s also a Stabilization Incentive Burn (SIB), which dissuades holders from selling their ndau during down markets by tacking on an additional fee for selling or moving ndau off the ndau blockchain. This additional fee is removed from circulating supply permanently, or “burned”.”, Lang addsndau also has a guided price regime that goes up over time, making this a “buoyant” digital currency. While stablecoins are useful for crypto holders who want to make everyday purchases and avoid downside volatility, they are not ideal for storing value. With digital currencies pegged to fiat currencies, such as the USD, holders run the risk of inflation each year that depreciates the value of the asset over time. ndau is a superior store of value because its monetary policy can help keep the price stable while ensuring appreciation over time.Glover claims that ndau is ideal for retirement accounts, pension funds, collateral accounts, bank reserves, and other purposes that would require a dependable, long-term store of value that can increase over time. ndau is also a safer medium of purchasing tokens during an ICO for both companies and investors. Its lower volatility than BTC and ETH make it an ideal long-term store of value for blockchain projects post-ICO, Glover adds.“We’re getting closer to going onto our own native blockchain and being listed on exchanges so that anyone can have access to buy and hold ndau”, Glover concludes.Eiland Glover, CEO of KowalaThe Kowala protocol represents the next iteration of cryptocurrency development. It is an algorithmic stable coin protocol that is not asset-backed, a key differentiating feature in the space right now.""Really, the drastic difference between an asset-backed stable coin and an algorithmic stable coin, in our opinion, is the removal of the need for trust. Rather than relying on the existence of assets in a bank vault, the miners in our model create the stablecoins that are produced in times of increased market demand, so they become, essentially, the issuers of newly-minted stablecoins under our model — as opposed to having a centralized authority to issue those stablecoins"", Glover explains.Glover explains that on the technical side, the protocol is a fork of the Ethereum codebase with an updated and a modified version of the Tendermint consensus protocol. There are two tokens: on the one hand, you have a stable cryptocurrency like the kUSD, designed to track the value of one U.S. dollar. Then, on the other hand, you have a mining token. Mining tokens really represent ownership of mining rights and give users the ability to associate those tokens within a node, actually being able to mine on the network.""Thus we have a truly decentralized stable coin, paired with a fast separate blockchain. We think this to be a winning combination. Our coin is designed as a means of payment more than anything else, and we hope to fulfill the initial promise of the Satoshi whitepaper, which was to create a truly decentralized payment platform"".Charles Manning, CEO of Kochava“Kochava is a 7-year old tech platform measuring advertising for the digital ecosystem. We track impressions, clicks, conversions, and post-conversion activity. We are, effectively, a vendor that is the system of record on behalf of advertisers to verify and validate that purchased ads are delivered”.""I was very interested in how distributed ledger technology (DLT) technology could be used in digital advertising. Our thought process was — unlike a small startup who attempts to change the world by getting into this transformation technology like blockchain — we have a unique position where we can facilitate the transformation of big companies using blockchain for digital advertising"", Manning explains.Charles Manning states that the token is used in three areas that some of the biggest, global brands use already: utility of buying and selling media, earning transaction fees because they are a delegated proof-of-stake system, and governance.“We are excited to sell tokens as a utility to show the value & efficiency of our platform across the ecosystem. We want players across the board in the digital advertising space — sight providers, supply-side providers, data management providers, publishers, affiliates, and others — to own tokens, so they have an equal say in that participation and can be part of driving the direction of the exchange moving forward”, he concludes.Vladislav Kiselev, CEO and Founder, The Joy:""From a short-term perspective, Stablecoins are undoubtedly the key to mass-implementation of cryptocurrencies in everyday life. That said, I think scalability and trust will be the biggest problem in 2019. This is because Stablecoins are asset-backed, yet ironically they do not have enough assets behind them in order to grow. By grow I mean where we see volumes on a scale that are average with state currencies. The biggest one, Tezos, claims to have billions on its account but it hasn’t provided any framework to prove this”.Kiselev states that on the other hand, countries or rather governments, are generally by definition much more transparent. They not only have the assets but also the power to sculpt the suitable legal conditions to launch their own Stablecoins. “As a result, in 2019 we can expect to see the emergence of the first state-backed Stablecoins with a specifically designed regulatory framework governing the use of cryptocurrencies"", he concludes.Hosam Mazawi, AlprockzAlrpockz AG is the company behind ROCKZ (RKZ), the first Swiss Franc backed stable coin. Founded by a group of experienced Regulators and Banking & Finance professionals the company recently formed a partnership with companies such as Geneva Swiss Bank, Swisscom and Wisekey in order to bring their product to market by the end of the year.Mazawi claims that ROCKZ (RKZ) offers the highest grade of stability and security provided that each ROCKZ (RKZ) is backed by the equivalent amount in Swiss Francs (CHF) - 1 RKZ = 1 CHFSome interesting points on Alprockz are the following:The Swiss Francs reserves will be held off-chain as collateral with third-party custodians in Switzerland never to be made accessible to Alprockz AGUp to 90% of reserves will be held as physical banknotes in high-security vaults in the Swiss Alps, 10% with Swiss banks to provide liquidity The funds held as collateral for ROCKZ (RKZ) will be audited on monthly basis by an independent third party ROCKZ (RKZ) can be redeemed for their underlying assets at any point in time in a legally enforceable wayROCKZ (RKZ) are considered a cash equivalent since it’s intrinsic value lies in the underlying fiat currencies collateralized  ROCKZ AG was recognized as a financial intermediary in Switzerland by VQF. VQF will audit and control the company in order to ensure it fully follows the regulatory frameworks in terms of compliance and anti-money laundering“Compared to the other stablecoins on the market, we give full ownership over the underlying asset to the users.  ROCKZ (RKZ) are considered a cash equivalent since its intrinsic value lies in the underlying fiat currencies collateralized. If you compare it to USDT, Paxos, USDC, GUSD, none of them counts as cash or can be used as cash, they are there just to facilitate the trading pairs, nothing else”, Mozawi says.Mazawi explains that today there is no ideal way for traders and crypto investors to harvest their profit in a secure manner without returning to fiat currency. Investors who momentarily wish to take profit out of the system before entering a new position, incur high fees every time they exit and re-enter. The alternative is to keep assets on an exchange or wallet, where they face the inherent security and counterparty risks of the exchange, or the market risks of holding main coins such as Bitcoin or Ethereum.The project was initially funded by private investors from Switzerland, with 2 capital raise rounds in 2018 and they recently opened their doors for funding through their utility token APZ, that will eventually provide access to the ROCKZ platform.Where art thou stable coin in 2019?Stablecoins have been one of the main talking points for the cryptocurrency community in 2018 and could be the driving force behind new regulatory standards, especially in light of Tether, the most popular stable coin, losing its alleged stability and falling to $0.91 back in October. For a fiat-pegged stable coin, the whole point is to maintain parity with the price of the traditional asset. Tether is supposedly backed by the U.S. dollar, but the company behind Tether has never allowed an independent audit of its reserves. As of December 2018, the circulating supply of Tether tokens are over 1,850,000,000 and it is genuinely hard to believe that a company that switched banks immediately after the fall of its ‘stable’ token and moved to the Bahamas has almost $2 billion dollars in its reserves.Nevertheless, Tether remains the most popular stablecoin on the cryptocurrency market. But its recent fall prompted many exchanged to expand their stablecoin options. In particular, Binance, who claim to be the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume, has recently added TrueUSD (TUSD), USD Coin (USDC) and Paxos Standard Token (PAX) to the platform. Paxos Standard Token was even listed as a base pair recently, which means it can be traded against every single cryptocurrency on Binance.Considering how popular stablecoins have become recently and the fact that they are very closely linked to fiat, it’s clear that financial regulators in the U.S. will soon find the legal framework they deem appropriate for stablecoins, especially the ones pegged to the U.S. dollar. Experts are currently speculating on which particular agency will regulate stablecoins, but some insiders are confident that very soon they will be classified as commodities, meaning that stablecoins will fall under the CFTC’s jurisdiction.

Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.]The sentiment of these articles varied significantly, based on variables such as publication date and their respective media outlet.Publications focused on business and finance, for example, had a strong tendency toward positive coverage of digital currency.The report cited Forbes and Business Insider, specifically, as two media outlets with this kind of focus.During the relevant period, these two publications produced 1,335 articles that were deemed more positive than the median sentiment of all articles evaluated in this study, and only 413 articles that were less positive than the median.Breitbart News and Raw Story took a very different approach, releasing 92 articles on digital currency, with only one of them being more positive than the median.CNBC was among the most neutral, as 52.9% of the approximately 1,000 crypto articles it published during the period were positive, and the remaining 47.1% were negative.The graphic below lists close to 50 media outlets and the sentiment of their digital currency coverage:This chart shows the sentiment of crypto coverage by media outlet.Publication DateAnother key variable that affected the sentiment of digital currency coverage was time. The report emphasizes that before 2017, the amount of crypto coverage was relatively low.Coverage skyrocketed in late 2017, a surge that coincided with an aggressive bull market in digital assets.The price of bitcoin peaked at $19,783.21, according to CoinDesk price data. Shortly after reaching this pinnacle, coverage of the digital currency space hit an all-time high, before falling significantly over the next several months, according to the Clovr report.The chart below depicts how crypto coverage and the market value of bitcoin fluctuated during the period:This graph shows the relationship between bitcoin's market cap and media coverage.The report noted that during times when the digital currency industry drew significant coverage, the attention was not always positive. Roughly halfway through 2017, when these innovative assets were enjoying a very healthy bull market, the number of negative articles ticked higher.After bitcoin peaked and digital currencies began plummeting in value, negative coverage rose sharply, and stories of people who lost money were prevalent.One interesting development is that as the number of articles surrounding digital currencies increased, the sentiment values became less volatile. The Clovr report provided a few possible explanations for this shift.For starters, it could simply be that as cryptocurrency became more mainstream, society had a less severe reaction in terms of either commending the latest news or condemning it.Another possibility is simply that the same size became larger, which helped smooth out the averages.Disclosure: I own some bitcoin, bitcoin cash and ether."

Is there a gap in the market for such a  project?The market reaction so far:We have all known that ICO’s have been under a severe battering of late with several having been proven as scams and billions lost in gullible investor’s money. However, Kinesis Money claim to be different from the rest and have already had quite an impressive round of fund raising in what can only be described as torrid circumstances.In fact, Kinesis Money’s presale sold more than $55 million worth of KVT (Kinesis Velocity Tokens).  The public sale started on 10 September (ending mid March 2019) so far in total $58,061,000 (USD) – worth of KVTs (in total for pre sale and public sale combined)The average ICO (initial coin offering) raises around $18 million with heavy marketing – Kinesis Money is quadrupling that, and has not gone mainstream yet with its marketing.  One more factor makes this a solid venture is that the infrastructure is fully developed.Kinesis Money is fully operated by the Allocated Bullion Exchange (ABX), an institutional marketplace set up in 2011 for the trade of physical precious metals, gold and silver, being two of the most stable and definable stores of value, across seven global locations.  For the benefit of Kinesis Money, ABX provides the comprehensive infrastructure with the advent of blockchain technology - and the introduction of cryptocurrencies. This gives it a firm advantage over other cryptos in the gold space which simply do not have this backing.Thomas’ father, Michael Coughlin acts as the company’s CFO was previously awarded cadetship with the Australian Taxation Office in the early 70s. Michael is also ABX’s CFO and has a longstanding career steeped in accountancy and financial services.We caught up with Thomas Coughlin to talk cryptocurrencies, the market and where he expects it to go from here.You cannot do much with a kilo bar of gold that is stored in a vault somewhere. You cannot monetize it and or access the liquidity in terms of the sterling value that is represented. According to Coughlin: “We saw the introduction of cryptocurrencies, and combining a traditional asset such as physical gold with a digital currency, as a great opportunity to return to being able to transact gold easily and efficiently - using it as a medium of exchange.”An incentive to spend and trade – making it into a proper monetary system – rather than lying in a vaultTo encourage users to send, spend and transact on the Kinesis Blockchain Network, Kinesis has introduced a multi-faceted yield system that remits the 0.45 per cent it takes on each transaction back out to the network - based on how they’ve participated. For example, depositing physical gold into the Kinesis Vault Network via ABX, converting it into Kinesis currencies and then sending, spending or transacting it qualifies you for a minter yield, while others may get a depositer or holder yield.  According to Thomas: “These mechanisms are designed to bring metal into the Kinesis Monetary System and then get it moving, we don’t want to have something that people are just holding in the way we’ve seen with bitcoin. We’ve developed this to facilitate trade.”Kinesis Money opted to create a proprietary fork of the Stellar Blockchain Network to enable extremely fast transaction speeds and a truly scalable global monetary system. Meanwhile, the Kinesis debit card allows for instant conversation of Kinesis’s currencies into fiat currency anywhere in the world where Visa or Mastercard are accepted.“Our goal is to create transaction velocity and trade volume – this will become the new ‘gold standard’ as we know it. We’ve put gold and silver on to the blockchain to create cryptocurrencies that allow people to instantly and efficiently send value around the world.”  What do you believe are the main challenges for the crypto market at present?“There are a number of problems faced by the crypto markets as of late. Cryptocurrencies experience high volatility which makes it difficult to rely on these currencies as steady investments. In addition to this, cryptocurrencies, for the most part, lack intrinsic value making it problematic to distinguish a fair price point. Currently, they are simply slaves to the economic principles of supply and demand.  Coughlin explains that as a result of this, the majority of the cryptocurrency market cap is often wiped out overnight which only further highlights the use case for a successful stablecoin with tangible value, immune to such fluctuations.Cryptocurrencies have not yet become an effective medium of exchange and compounding this issue is the fact that they lack intrinsic value which is the biggest factor stopping them from being adopted by the mainstream.“Crypto transactions are often time-consuming, with transactions sometimes taking hours, fees to transact can also be quite costly depending on the price of the crypto. But the biggest problem is the difficulty that comes with extracting your cryptocurrency into useable, real-world currency to be used at point-of-sale to make purchases, or to withdraw as fiat currency”.  How can stablecoins lead to the mass adoption of crypto on a global level?“The key to cryptocurrencies being widely adopted is simple; they must be considered as a stable store of value. For us to achieve this, we based our stablecoins on something extremely stable, for instance, precious metals such as gold and silver. If the cryptocurrency is backed by a stable asset the price of that currency will reflect accordingly. If this currency can also be redeemable for the underlying asset, this will further validate the stability and trust associated with this currency”.Most importantly, users of the cryptocurrency should have an easy and effortless way to liquidate their holdings into a currency which is widely respected, across the world. The attachment of a debit card would be the ideal solution as this would ensure users could send, spend or transact with these currencies at point-of-sale anywhere in the world, with a currency free from fluctuation, Coughlin adds.   “Current stablecoins have many issues which affect their valuation and usability. These include counterparty risk, such as when the bank holding the dollar backing is considered insolvent and a lack of liquidity. Or, an arbitrary mechanism being used to keep the stablecoin’s price in line with the price of the underlying asset”.Why did you choose Stellar as your platform?The reason we choose to use the Stellar blockchain network is due to the scalability the technology provides which offers upwards of 3000 transactions per seconds for a very low fee.These features made the Stellar blockchain technology the most suitable option to sustain a global monetary system which can withstand user’s transaction all over the world and support of the attachment of a debit card.The Stellar consensus protocol eliminates the need for resource intensive, energy consuming mining protocols, such as proof of stake or proof of work, like bitcoin and ethereum use. This makes transactions slow and consumes a vast amount of energy, Stellar has allowed us to avoid these pitfalls. Your presale was very encouraging - what are the next steps for the project?“By the end of the presale of our Kinesis Velocity Token (KVT) we had successfully sold over 50,000 KVTs, more than 3 times higher than our assigned soft cap of 15,000 KVTs and we are well on track to reach our hard cap of 210,000 KVTs before the public sale ends on the 18th of March 2019. The next steps will include the issuance of our gold and silver-based currencies, KAU (gold) and KAG (silver) as well as the release of the Kinesis Currency Exchange (KCX), Kinesis Blockchain Exchange (KBE) and the Kinesis eWallet to the public in May 2019”.Furthermore, Coughlin revealed that they will be rolling out the Kinesis debit card which will be in line with the development of global strategic partnerships and integration of Kinesis technology to maximize usage of Kinesis currencies through retail and customer-facing outlets.In addition to this, Kinesis currencies, including the KVT, will be released across 3rd party cryptocurrency exchanges to ensure adoption and usage of Kinesis currencies is maintained, and that should result in continued growth. “Our main strategies are in securing strategic partnerships and building a solid userbase for our underlying technology, the Kinesis Blockchain Exchange. This is where our financial ecosystem will sit and people will interact and be able to mint their fiat currency into digital gold and silver”.This technology will serve as a simple and easy user interface that connects the everyday individual to the blockchain. This will give them the ability to create their own currency based on 1:1 physical allocated gold and silver. People can then start to spend money within the ecosystem that generates a yield on all money spent, Coughlin added. What will 2019 bring for the crypto market? Will it be the year of stablecoins?“At the end of 2017 the world began to take notice of the crypto markets as Bitcoin prices soared as everyone wanted a piece of the pie. This seemed, and still seems to be the future of money, based on technological advances. Throughout 2018 the crypto markets underwent severe volatility. The rise of initial currency offerings (ICOs), decentralized applications, or dApps and crypto exchanges, all hoped to take advantage of the emerging industry to secure investments and a strong userbase. As we head closer to the end of 2018, with the markets once again in disarray, the crypto sphere is left questioning where to go next. It has been evident that a void has been created which can only be filled by projects creating stability in the cryptomarkets”.Coughlan explains that USDT Tether has had significant success as the leading stable coin across exchanges and the crypto markets, however, they have been criticized and declared untrustworthy as a result of the failure of audits. This has been widely covered in the crypto press and remains a cause for major concern for prospective investors. “Industry leaders, like Vitalik Buterin, founder of Ethereum, believe that at this point, for the space to move forward we need blockchain projects with real-world applications. The next wave of crypto adoption will be built on useful applications that deliver value to people, and we agree. This is why we have introduced a cryptocurrency which encompasses two of the most stable stores of value the world has known, gold and silver”.“So to sum up, I strongly believe that 2019 will be the year of the stablecoin and we hope to be at the forefront in making this a reality”, Coughlin concluded.  "

single chain. Traditionally, accepting two concurrent blocks on a chain ...","Dec 4, 2018,11:36am EST","Conflux Foundation co-founder and Turing winner, Andrew Yao","Conflux, a blockchain protocol based on Proof of Work, that has been aimed at China’s tech giants as a decentralised, scalable, dApp blockchain solution has garnered much attention from some well-regarded investors.The likes of Sequoia China, Metastable, IMO Ventures, as well as a significant Chinese tech company, have funded The Conflux Foundation, developers of Conflux, to the sum of $35 million.What makes Conflux a different solution for dApp development is the decision to not go with the industry flow which is seeing most blockchain solutions offering Proof of Stake options. Conflux, by weaving a Directed Acylic Graph (DAG) data structure into its Proof of Work consensus algorithm, believes it can solve scaling issues by offering higher Transactions Per Second (TPS) than Visa.Conflux is trying to tackle the long-standing scaling issue which has precluded many blockchains from mass adoption, and by enticing significant funding from these notable investors, there seems to be considerable interest from China’s tech industry for its potential.Differentiating with DAGThe DAG data structure that Conflux is utilising to scale the blockchain solution and make transactions quicker and easier on its dApp protocol is the defining point. DAG has been touted as the next evolution of blockchain as it solves the scaling issue, although there have been criticisms about its decentalisation.Blockchains like Bitcoin only allow a single block at one time onto a single chain. Traditionally, accepting two concurrent blocks on a chain would be considered a fork, with just one block ultimately emerging as the longest chain, while the fork recording discarded transactions on a completely unrelated chain. Computing power and electricity is consequently squandered for the separate chain that doesn’t contribute to the blockchain performance.However, Conflux accepts multiple concurrent blocks at the same time from any node through its DAG web. Unlike traditional blockchains, the Conflux protocol records information about two kinds of relationships between blocks, parent-child relationships and generate-before relationships, which create a DAG-like structure of the blockchain protocol.“Imagine developing dApps on a fully decentralised protocol like Bitcoin, with the scalability of centralised platforms. Conflux solves the traditional consensus bottleneck that Proof of Work blockchains, like Bitcoin, have been stymied by,” said Fan Long, co-founder at the Conflux Foundation.Long goes on to expand on just why it is crucial for blockchains to scale:“The scalability bottleneck of traditional blockchains is severely limiting their further adoptions. Because of only being able to process 7-20 transactions per second, we are experiencing congested networks, skyrocketing fees, and annoying experience. Many perceived great dApps like decentralised oracles and exchanges are not possible with this limited transaction throughput. So yes, blockchains need to be upgraded. Otherwise, the applications of blockchains will stay with just storage of values, ICO, and gambling games.”Piquing interestConflux maintains that it is fully decentralised, yet scalable, and for this reason, it is managing to tick many boxes that have kept significant companies out of blockchain technology. Their claim, however, is holding much water as the investment round that garnered them $35 million is backed up by savvy investors.Haseeb Qureshi, General Partner at MetaStable Capital, explains the attraction to Conflux and the work they have done with a Proof of Work-based DAG protocol.“Conflux has the strongest approach we’ve seen to a proof of work-based DAG protocol. DAG protocols comprise a very promising approach to improving the throughput of blockchains. If we want to reach world-scale throughput for these systems, DAGs are undoubtedly part of the way to get there,” Qureshi explained.Thomas Yao, Partner at IMO Ventures, echoes Qureshi thoughts, explaining how there has been a bit of a search for such a solution.“We've been searching for a company to solve the fundamental Blockchain infrastructure problem. When we came across Conflux, we were impressed by their consensus protocol that designed with DAG structure. Moreover, they have an excellent team led by the first and only Chinese Turing Award recipient Andrew Yao and few of his smartest students, which make me believe they can deliver the idea into a well-functioned blockchain,” Yao said.Funding for the futureIn the current cryptocurrency climate, it could be argued that the excitement and revolutionary blockchain talk of late 2017 is all in the past now. However, instances like these, where huge funding is being put into projects aimed at the future, seems to suggest that the future is still bright for emerging blockchain technology.Qureshi goes on to explain that the loss of interest in the cryptocurrency market and the resulting poor performance is merely a loss of speculators, which is not the worst thing.“It may look like cryptocurrency markets have given up the ghost, but most of that is just speculative money leaving. For the last year, cryptocurrencies have resembled the world’s biggest casino. However, all speculative fervours eventually die away, and what’s left is the real stuff of innovation—people building real things and solving real problems.”“We need a world-scale cryptocurrency. Bitcoin and Ethereum currently don’t scale, and can’t yet fulfil that role. Conflux’s DAG protocol is very promising, and I’m hopeful it will prove itself a worthy claimant.”Yao goes on to explain that the cryptocurrency market is its own beast, and entirely different to what is happening in blockchain advancement.“There is a big difference between the cryptocurrency market investment and blockchain technology investment. Most of the people in the cryptocurrency market are irrational when comes to blockchain technology innovation. The crypto investment market is like a big casino. It's gambling, not investments. We are investing in blockchain technologies,” he added.Blockchain investment is still active and healthy, according to the likes of Yao and Qureshi, who seem to be showing relief that the frenzy around the technology has died down.There’s still plenty of capital and appetite for blockchain investing. Valuations have come down to earth, and there’s less frenzy around ICOs, which is good and healthy. It encourages a return to fundamentals and a refocusing on addressing the real problems as they exist today,” said Qureshi with Yao adding:“I can't comment on other VC companies, but for IMO Ventures, we don't chase the market. Our partners have invested in blockchain technologies as early as the Ether ICO in 2014. The ‘killer app’ of blockchain investments is the protocol. In my mind, Conflux has the potential to become the next protocol with ""killer app""s running on top of it.”"

new scam is rising to the top, like bits of toilet paper in sewage: ...","Nov 25, 2018,11:16am EST","Everybody is familiar with the Ponzi scheme: the scammer dupes investors into giving him their money, paying out early investors with incoming investments, thus presenting a veneer of respectability.","The great thing about Ponzi schemes? They really work. Investors are all happy with their returns, whether they stay in or get out.Ponzi schemes work, that is, until they don’t. Eventually losses steamroll, and the Ponzi schemer is quickly out of business.Today’s cryptocurrency world is rife with scammers to be sure, and the number of different scams is as great as the number of marks willing to fall for them.But with the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in the doldrums, a new scam is rising to the top, like bits of toilet paper in sewage: stablecoins.How the Con WorksA stablecoin is a cryptocurrency whose value is pegged to an existing asset – potentially gold or some other commodity, but most commonly to a fiat currency like the US dollar.The stablecoin con begins with a simple value proposition. “[Stablecoins’] main use case is to provide cryptocurrency users with the ability to convert volatile crypto positions into anti-fragile or ‘stable’ alternatives,” explains Sam Ouimet, market analyst at CoinDesk.In other words, if Bitcoin or some other crypto is too volatile for your liking, move your crypto investment into a stablecoin. Its value will go up or down with the value of the underlying asset, but will be far more stable than the crypto you had invested in before.Just one problem: as with any Ponzi scheme, the value of your investment is stable until the bottom falls out, and it becomes worthless. Your money, meanwhile, is in the pockets of the scammers.The Three Types of Stablecoin: From Bad to WorseConfusion about the inner workings of a con is itself part of the confidence game – and stablecoin is no different. Case in point: stablecoins can be algorithmic, crypto-based, or collateralized with fiat (or potentially gold or other commodities with value).With algorithmic stablecoin, the vendor of the coin in question maintains its market value by buying its coins on the open market when its value goes down while selling them when its value goes up, thus bringing its value back to whatever fiat value it has pegged each coin to (typically $1). Furthermore, the vendor pays for its coins with IOUs, or ‘crypto-bonds.’Even Stablecoin aficionados see risk in the algorithmic approach. “The smart contracts and sometimes the incentivized participants of the network will affect the supply and demand of the available tokens and fix the price around a predetermined amount,” explain analysts at BlockShow. “This particular approach carries the advantages of decentralization and doesn’t require the trust of the main issuing entity but could be prone to the attacks that affect the price of the stablecoin.”Such attacks, however, are the least of this approach’s problems. “The bonds are supposed to appeal to investors because they trade at a discount — so that, in principle, their price can rise,” explains Barry Eichengreen, professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley, and a former senior policy adviser at the 
 
International Monetary Fund
. “Here, too, the flaw in the model will be obvious to even a novice central banker. The issuer’s ability to service the bonds depends on the growth of the platform, which is not guaranteed. If the outcome becomes less certain, the price of the bonds will fall. More bonds will then have to be issued to prevent a given fall in the value of the coin, making it even harder to meet interest obligations.”In other words, a Ponzi scheme.Crypto-Based Stablecoins: ‘Perpetual Motion Machines’Crypto-based stablecoins are no better. In this approach, the vendor of the stablecoin collateralizes its coins with other crypto. Take, for example, the Dai stablecoin from MakerDAO, which runs on the Ethereum blockchain. “[The MakerDAO Dai stablecoin] system makes zero sense and is broken to the core: it only works if the price of Ether goes up,” says Preston Byrne, attorney/solicitor at Byrne & Storm, P.C. “Unfortunately for them, history shows that this investment thesis has been wrong 100% of the time, and Ethereum is as user-friendly and scalable as an angry rhinoceros experiencing heroin withdrawal.”The bottom line: “Crypto-collateralized stablecoins are the perpetual motion machines of modern finance,” according to Byrne. In fact, MakerDAO has a plan it calls ‘emergency shutdown’ for when the bottom falls out and it is no longer able to maintain Dai’s stable value – which, in fact, happens to every Ponzi scheme sooner or later.The Fiat Collateral Shell GameThe third approach to implementing a stablecoin is to collateralize it with real money (or other assets with value). In other words, for every stablecoin worth $1 the vendor issues, it maintains at least $1 in the bank, held against the eventuality that there will be a ‘run’ on the stablecoin, where everybody wants their money back.Just one problem: many vendors choose to partially collateralize their stablecoins, maintaining a reserve of cash insufficient to cover such a run, vaguely similar to the fractional reserve system that banks use to lend more money than they receive in deposits.Only the fractional reserve system is heavily regulated, the US Government (as well as many other governments around the world) guarantees many deposits, and banks pay interest and/or provide value-added services to depositors – characteristics that no stablecoin can offer.What, then, are the benefits to holders of partially collateralized stablecoins? They get to give up control of their hard-earned real money in exchange for tokens that at best return their deposit, while at worst they lose everything. They even give up the possibility of another run-up in the price of their crypto.Ask yourself: why would anyone take such a deal? And more importantly, why would any on-the-level business ever think it could make money offering such a value proposition to its customers?From Tether to CircleThe most popular stablecoin, USDT from Tether, is an example of a supposedly fully collateralized stablecoin – only it has heretofore been unwilling to submit to a public audit of its fiat reserves.In November 2017, Tether experienced an inevitable meltdown characteristic of all Ponzi schemes, as it was unable to maintain its peg to the US dollar, as the chart below illustrates.The price of Tether’s USDT stablecoin relative to the US dollar from June through October 2018,... [+] showing its loss of peg to the dollar on October 15.Note that in the chart above, USDT’s price relative to the dollar was quite stable – until suddenly it wasn’t. “Tether, which is pegged one-to-one to the dollar, claims to hold dollar deposits equal to the value of its circulation. But the veracity of this claim has been disputed,” Eichengreen continues. “This points to yet another problem with this model: expense. To issue one dollar’s worth of Tether to you or me, the platform must attract one dollar of investment capital from you or me, and place it in a dollar bank account. One of us then will have traded a perfectly liquid dollar, supported by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, for a cryptocurrency with questionable backing that is awkward to use.”Eichengreen concludes: “This exchange may be attractive to money launderers and tax evaders, but not to others.”In response to Tether’s woes, Circle Internet Financial touts that its reserves exceed the dollar value of its ‘USD Coin’ stablecoin in circulation – and even posted a letter from accounting firm Grant & Thornton attesting to the fact.However, the letter’s contents are fishier than week-old mackerel, as careful reading of the letter’s intentionally obscure fine print reveals that it states that the accounting firm essentially took Circle Internet Financial’s word on how much money it had in its accounts. (A Grant Thornton spokesperson confirmed that the letter is a legitimate Grant Thornton document, but stated that the firm’s policy is not to comment on client work.)Propping Up Value of BitcoinEver wonder why Bitcoin experienced such a dramatic spike in its price in late 2017? While feverish speculative interest is certainly partly to blame, one researcher has concluded that illegal market manipulation using Tether’s stablecoin was the primary culprit.In their report Is Bitcoin Really Un-Tethered?, University of Texas at Austin McCombs School of Business professor John M. Griffin and his student Amin Shams uncovered the fraud. “Purchases with Tether are timed following market downturns and result in sizable increases in Bitcoin prices. Less than 1% of hours with such heavy Tether transactions are associated with 50% of the meteoric rise in Bitcoin and 64% of other top cryptocurrencies,” write Griffin and Shams. “These patterns cannot be explained by investor demand proxies but are most consistent with the supply-based hypothesis where Tether is used to provide price support and manipulate cryptocurrency prices.”Another well-known economist and crypto naysayer, Nouriel Roubini, takes issue with how Tether props up the value of Bitcoin. “Tether Printing Press in High Gear, Issuing $400 [million] of Fake USD in 4 Days to Manipulate and Prop Up the Price of Bitcoin,” Roubini tweets. “Without this criminal manipulation Bitcoin would crash by 80% based on a recent econometric study. And regulators are asleep at the wheel.” (See my recent article on Nouriel Roubini.)Tether, however, disputes the claim of fraudulent price manipulation. “The entire study relies on the assumption that USDT is unbacked and therefore not sufficiently driven by trader demand,” explains Leonardo Real, chief compliance officer at Tether. “This is flawed, and claims which suggest that USDT transactions aren’t driven by demand when it is consistently in the top 2 of traded cryptocurrencies in the space with regards to volume, are simply ridiculous by now.”I am reminded of the scene in The Wizard of Lies where Robert DeNiro as Bernie Madoff receives redemption requests he can’t handle, signaling the unraveling of his massive Ponzi scheme.Today, Madoff no longer lives in luxury – but I’m sure he’d welcome company. It looks like stablecoins will sooner or later grant that wish.Intellyx publishes the Agile Digital Transformation Roadmap poster, advises companies on their digital transformation initiatives, and helps vendors communicate their agility stories.

They are also probably not the last given that the SEC looks at such ICO issuance retrospectively.The SEC’s orders found that Mayweather, who was reported by Forbes to have made $285 million in prize money, salary, bonuses and endorsements between June 1, 2017, and June 1, 2018 (attributing $275 million of that to fighting Conor McGregor in August last year), failed to disclose promotional payments from three ICO issuers, including $100,000 from Centra Tech Inc., and that Khaled failed to disclose a $50,000 payment from Centra Tech, which he touted on his social media accounts as a “Game changer.”He topped the Forbes and Sports Illustrated lists of the 50 highest-paid athletes for 2012 and 2013, plus the Forbes list again in both 2014 and 2015, which listed him as the highest paid athlete in the world.And, he had generated around 23.8 million Pay-per view (PPV) buys and $1.67 billion in revenue throughout his career, which put in perspective surpasses the likes of Mike Tyson, Evander Holyfield, Lennox Lewis, Oscar De La Hoya and Manny Pacquiao.On one level you might argue that the settlements made by the two parties were more than what they gained in terms of the inducements, but has it gone far enough to dissuade others?Moreover, is the settlement with the SEC really going to dent Mayweather’s financial standing - it represents around 0.11% of what his average weekly earnings were in the 12 months to June 1, 2018 (as cited above). And, after all it is not like he actually needed to rely on that extra cash.Mayweather's promotions included a message to his Twitter followers that Centra's ICO “starts in a few hours. Get yours before they sell out, I got mine…”And, a post on his Instagram account predicted that he would make a substantial amount of money on another ICO. In a post via Twitter it was stated: ""You can call me Floyd Crypto Mayweather from now on.""  The SEC order found that Mayweather failed to disclose that he was paid $200,000 to promote the other two ICOs.Mayweather and Khaled's promotions came after the SEC issued its DAO Report back in 2017 warning that coins sold in ICOs may be securities and that those who offer and sell securities in the U.S. must comply with federal securities laws.Subsequently in April 2018, the Commission filed a civil action against Centra’s founders, alleging that the ICO was fraudulent. The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York filed parallel criminal charges.Without admitting or denying the findings, Mayweather and Khaled agreed to pay disgorgement, penalties and interest in aggregate totalling $767,510.In Mayweather’s case, the boxer agreed to pay $300,000 in disgorgement, a $300,000 penalty as well as $14,775 in “prejudgment” interest. Khaled agreed to pay $50,000 in disgorgement, a $100,000 penalty and $2,725 in prejudgment interest.In addition, Mayweather agreed not to promote any securities, digital or otherwise, for three years, and Khaled agreed to a similar ban for two years. He also agreed to continue to cooperate with the investigation, which is continuing.Stephanie Avakian, Enforcement Division Co-Director at the SEC and formerly a partner at Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP, commenting in the wake of the settlement said: “These cases highlight the importance of full disclosure to investors. With no disclosure about the payments, Mayweather and Khaled's ICO promotions may have appeared to be unbiased, rather than paid endorsements.”Investors should be “skeptical of investment advice” posted to social media platforms, Steven Peikin, Enforcement Division Co-Director stressed.A former Managing Partner of Sullivan & Cromwell LLP’s criminal defense and investigations group, where his practice focused on white-collar criminal defense, regulatory enforcement and internal investigations, he added: “They [investors] should not make decisions based on celebrity endorsements. Social media influencers are often paid promoters, not investment professionals, and the securities they’re touting, regardless of whether they are issued using traditional certificates or on the blockchain, could be frauds.""Steven Peikin, Co-Director of the SEC’s Division of Enforcement, who served as an Assistant U.S.... [+] Attorney in the Southern District of New York from 1996 to 2004. (Source: U.S. SEC).SEC's Other Recent ActionsIt has certainly been a busy November for the SEC in terms of actions. On November 28 the financial regulator charged self-described promoter Eric Landis from Charlottesville, Virginia, with micro-cap market manipulation scheme. Some two weeks earlier (November 16) two ICO issuers - CarrierEQ Inc. (Airfox) and Paragon Coin Inc - settled SEC registration charges and agreed to register tokens as securities.Boston-based start-up Airfox raised around $15 million worth of digital assets in order to finance their development of a token-denominated “ecosystem” starting with a mobile application, which would allow users in emerging markets to earn tokens and exchange them for data by interacting with advertisements.Paragon, an online entity, raised approximately $12 million worth of digital assets to develop and implement its business plan to add blockchain technology to the cannabis industry and work toward legalization of cannabis. Neither entities registered their ICOs pursuant to the federal securities laws, nor did they qualify for an exemption to the registration requirements.And, among a total of seventeen similar SEC actions communicated during the month, on November 7 it was announced that Citibank N.A. was to pay more than $38.7 million for “improper handling” of ADRs (American Depositary Receipts), U.S. securities representing foreign shares of a foreign company, in relation to what were described “pre-released” ADRs.On the same day brokerage ITG was charged with misleading dark pool subscribers with its POSIT dark pool and agreed to pay $12 million to settle. Furthermore, additional charges were brought against a New York boiler room scheme that targeted senior citizens and generated over $3.3 million of illegal profits (November 15).Add to all the above, on November 8 Zachary Coburn, founder of EtherDelta, a digital token trading platform, was charged with operating an unregistered exchange (November 8), for secondary market trading of ERC20 tokens, a type of blockchain-based token commonly issued in ICOs. Over an 18-month period, EtherDelta's users executed over 3.6 million orders for ERC20 tokens, including tokens that are securities under the federal securities laws.The SEC has previously brought enforcement actions relating to unregistered broker-dealers and unregistered ICOs, including some of the tokens traded on EtherDelta.In light of this case, the SEC’s Steven Peikin noted at the time: “We are witnessing a time of significant innovation in the securities markets with the use and application of distributed ledger technology (DLT). But to protect investors, this innovation necessitates the SEC's thoughtful oversight of digital markets and enforcement of existing laws.”Whatever else, the SEC has got its work cut out in monitoring the crypto/digital/DLT sector given all the aforementioned misdemeanors. If anything, this might point to increasing the levels of fines and settlements, as it would appear that adverse forces - or even bad actors - have been at work and it shows little sign of abating any time soon.Charles Hoskinson, co-founder of IOHK and formerly of Ethereum (shown seated second from the left),... [+] speaking at a global ICO summit in Zurich, Switzerland, October 2017. (Source: Smart Valor).As Charles Hoskinson, formerly of Ethereum who in 2015 co-founded IOHK, a leading blockchain R&D company, who I recently caught with at the Malta Blockchain Summit earlier this November said in relation to investing in ICO’s: “Before purchasing an ICO, my first piece of advice would be to understand the project’s whitepaper and the product or service. The reality is that if you cannot understand the whitepaper then don’t buy into it.”In addition, the American from Boulder, Colorado, whose IOHK team over the past three years designed Cardano, an industrial-strength blockchain and the home of the Ada cryptocurrency, stressed that potential investors ""should never put more money into anything - ICOs included - than they can afford to lose and understand that these vehicles are tremendously speculative.”Pretty sound and sensible advice there. And, of course do your own dilligence and be wary of celebrity endorsements spouting on about vast fortunes to be made in a flash. There are also various we If it is too good to be true, it probably is.The SEC’s investigation concerning Messrs Mayweather and Khaled Khaled  is being conducted by Alison R. Levine of the New York Regional Office and Jon A. Daniels, Luke M. Fitzgerald, and John O. Enright of the Enforcement Division’s Cyber Unit. The case is being supervised by Cyber Unit Chief Robert A. Cohen."

at ...","Dec 13, 2018,11:12am EST",Santa Claus Greeting On Roof,"The holidays are upon us, and so are the annoying questions our relatives ask about trending issues. While our loved ones mean well, if they can’t figure out “The Facebook,” they must be similarly perplexed about more cutting edge tech such as Blockchain.Many people are still having trouble figuring out just what this whole thing is, and are fed with rumors or Reddit discussions. Thus, often did people make purchase decisions during the 2017-8 ICO craze based solely on the fear of missing out.Quite a few platforms and companies are trying to help people hop on the blockchain wagon easily, making them less afraid of the whole phenomenon. This includes Coinbase providing us with a simple interface, or Binance letting everyone exchange a huge selection of coins and fiat (though, with much more complexity).But that doesnt help the long tail population, such as your uncle who might not get that “blockchain” and “Bitcoin” aren’t the same thing.“Bitcoin has been widely featured in the media, and many people have heard that it has to do with something called blockchain. Unfortunately, if thinking about blockchain only as the technology behind bitcoin, it is easy to miss its potential,” says Georg Greve, Chairman at blockchain-based company Vereign. ""If people are a bit aware of blockchain, many think that it’s just an inefficient distributed database.""Powerful though digital currencies may be, the potential for blockchain technologies expands far beyond Bitcoin and its peers. Your friends and relatives probably don’t grasp that if they dismiss all of blockchain because digital assets don’t suit them, they’re ignoring a wealth of technological advancements because of one application. It's understandable though, as the crypto market is volatile and has caused many people to lose their investment (and worse), however the overall picture of the underlying technology should not be ignored.Putting all of this in layman’s terms and spelling out some of the everyday use cases of blockchain can help here. Vitalik Buterin, founder of the popular and much-utilized Ethereum blockchain, is often quoted as saying “Whereas most technologies tend to automate workers on the periphery doing menial tasks, blockchains automate away the center. Instead of putting the taxi driver out of a job, blockchain puts Uber out of a job and lets the taxi drivers work with the customer directly.” That’s a great example that everyone around the table can understand, and you might even have some Uber drivers in your clan that can intimately relate. Blockchain newbies should envision what elections will look like when there’s one clear way to vote that is not alterable and not vulnerable to hacks. How different would our world be if voting were fair and secure for everyone? How much clearer could the political landscape be?Even though cryptocurrencies are just one aspect of blockchain, they still play an important role in the movement to decentralize, especially since they fuel the miners that make many blockchain projects work. With the recent market downturn, many people, especially woefully uninformed people, have made sweeping statements about the end of the crypto market that are totally unfounded. Such pessimism also misses the change in the status quo already achieved by cryptocurrencies. Charles Hoskinson, Founder of Cardano, a science-driven open source blockchain, put it really simply on Twitter: “The headlines and carnival barking from the media about the current state of Bitcoin and recent losses show they have never gotten our movement. $150 billion in value has been liberated from the banking system and now exists in a parallel economy. Our growth remains unchallenged.”If cryptocurrencies were only about personal investment opportunities, then altcoin haters might have a leg to stand on - for the moment. But it started as a way for individuals to gain independence from big banks that take advantage of their customers while offering little value in return, and that benefit remains and grows stronger every day. Then you have those who think they know a thing or two about blockchain, and confidently boast that blockchain is “the future” and that everything will be “on the blockchain.” And you can’t really blame them for thinking that, when plenty of blockchain ventures seem to imply just that.So maybe there is an upside to blockchain going a bit over the masses’ heads right now. Imagine Aunt Florence calling you, asking “Jimmy, how do I take Fluffy’s heart medication prescription off of the blockchain? I thought it was the e-mail, to the vet, but it wasn’t.” "

In 2015, he became globally known as 'Bitcoin Jack' after paying solely with Bitcoin for an entire month, from everything from buying groceries, getting a tattoo and even paying rent.","He is now the CEO and Co-Founder with Carl Jenster and Morten Nielsen of Aryze, a Copenhagen-based FinTech company that was founded in 2017  and has already won  the award for Best Fintech at Venture Cup 2018 and Best Startup at Copenhagen Fintech Week 2018.Here he talks exclusively to Forbes about Aryze and his company's plans for FinTech disruption.Monty Munford: So, what is exactly is Aryze and what is it doing in FinTech?Jack Nikogosian: Aryze uses distributed ledger technology to move the ownership of value, which reduces the number of intermediaries and thus cost and time.So, rather than moving money in and out of banks and payment processors, we assign the ownership of a certain amount of money to a user in a secure environment. Essentially the transfer of digital money without actually moving it.Why should other countries use a payment solution from Denmark?While Denmark is a small country of only 5.7 million people, this has also given technology providers opportunities to test proof of concepts and new solutions into smaller segments. As one of the most digital countries in the world, Denmark is the ideal place to build trusted and high-quality payment infrastructure for other nations to use.Denmark has been using digital identification methods for years and now we are moving towards digitizing our driver's licenses as one of the first countries ever. With a population that is used to digital solutions that create efficiencies in public systems, we believe a startup like ours has many opportunities to receive public funding, through both EU and domestic grants. Especially as we have chosen to focus heavily on solving some of the UN's 17 Sustainable Development Goals (particularly in regards to remittances), we are seeing a lot of positive feedback for what we are trying to do.Jack Nikogosian is on a mission to solve of the UN's Development Goals.Will there be 'traditional' banks in 10 years' time and if so, how will they be different from today's banks?I definitely believe that there will be banks 10 years from now - however, it is obvious that these banks will have to adapt and learn how to conduct business in a new way. Banks and banking services are gradually being disrupted by FinTech companies more and more.While it was extremely difficult, 20 years ago, to work with any financial instrument, we now have tools that enable anyone to work with AI, blockchain, Cloud solutions and much more.We are seeing now how large banks are realizing the need to work together with FinTechs and startups in order to offer new solutions to their own customers. We're also seeing startups having to work with traditional financial industries in order to gain trust, stability and easy access to a lot of people.Aryze want to solve the UN Sustainable Development Goal Number 10 by lowering the global average cost of sending money abroad from 7.2 per cent to 3 per cent. How are you going to do that? Most payment companies and banks are earning a percentage from each transactions conducted. When looking at wire transfer companies these businesses are still handling cash using local tellers and traditional banking infrastructures. We are not transferring money within traditional banking ecosystems, but rather using blockchain technologies to transfer ownership of funds that we keep still.We want to create an ecosystem that does not move money around constantly, but instead keeps money safe and in the only place it cannot go away: with the central banks that have issued them.Are blockchains and distributed technologies mature enough to scale into a global payment ecosystem?We believe so, yes. There are many different types of blockchain technologies and protocols and while some of these are in their infancy, the amount of development happening in this space is exponential and every day new solutions are appearing on the market.I don’t believe that there exists a single blockchain today that could facilitate the same amount of transactions as seen by Visa or Mastercard. However, it is a common misconception that these blockchains should handle each and every transaction directly within the system.We are seeing the rise of different concepts that use 'off-chain' technologies and bundling in order to net transactions and only synchronize them to a public blockchain as needed. These modern systems will enable millions of transactions to be bundled into a single transaction, rather than every micro or nano transaction having to be verified by thousands and thousands of individual miners.Why don't central banks or other centralised government entities simply issue their own national cryptocurrencies?To the contrary, there are central banks looking into this. In Canada, Sweden, China and Uruguay, central banks are examining the pros and cons of Central Bank-issued Digital Currencies (CBDC). The argument for doing so is to empower financial inclusion, provide additional consumer protections, and replace the anonymity of cash with the privacy of digital currency.It is against the best interests of a central bank to issue a national digital currency. It would violate the fundamental role and business model of a central bank to do so. If a central bank were to issue a CBDC, would any holder have access to an account in the central bank? If they were to offer this service to retail consumers, suddenly the central banks are set to compete with commercial banks. Would the central banks suddenly have to offer mortgage loans and the like?Furthermore, if a CBDC is created, corporations will flock to place short-term liquidity in the Central Bank's systems, bypassing bank deposits. That could mean catastrophe for the global economy as it undermines the way that traditional banking works.If money becomes 100% digital, won't we create a Big Brother society where every transaction is monitored  by both centralised and decentralised agencies?The Danish national currency is already estimated to be more than 90% digital and this number is increasing on a daily basis - the director of Jyske Bank has called for a cashless society within 10 years, for example. However, utilizing distributed ledger technologies, we could actually ensure security and privacy for all of our users, whereas today all of our transactions are monitored, monetized and analyzed by all of the underlying payment intermediaries that are involved.If central banks themselves issued digital currencies directly, moving into a Big Brother society is not only a possibility but actually quite plausible. This is why we believe that the solutions should be built from the bottom up rather than being built by governments or central banks themselves.If the central bank issued their own digital currencies, it would make sense for them to have programmable money in the sense that they could decide what the recipient of the funds could do with the money.We therefore see a moral obligation to not only replace anonymity with privacy, but also ensure that the digital cash of the future is democratized. Our users own their funds - we just have to make sure that they aren't breaking international law. As a Danish company, we seek to comply with European GDPR regulations, worldwide. We have  a duty to ensure that the money of the future is to the benefit of the average individual. That is our mandate."

His 69-page complaint claims the telecom giant had failed to protect his phone number—even after escalating his account to a “higher security level” with “special protection”—resulting in a combined $24 million hack of his cryptocurrencies.This number might dwarf compared to the infamous Mt. Gox hack, where over $460 million was stolen, or the DAO hack ($50 million), or the more recent hacks of Conrail ($37.2 million) and Bithumb ($31 million). But the scary part is the ease with which these hacks are carried out. In fact, instead of breaking into smart contracts or hacking into exchanges and stealing private keys, now kids between 19 and 22 years old can steal millions at an expense of 99 cents, with relatively no effort.Has blockchain failed to deliver a secure digital currency and has turned into a haven for cybercriminals?The idea behind bitcoin was to create a peer-to-peer system that allowed two parties that did not now and did not trust each other transact financially without allowing for double-spending or hacking the system. For that, it created an immutable ledger that can only break to a “51% attack”—an attack which requires enormous computing power of malicious nodes to overrun the honest ones. While this system has failed smaller networks, it has been battle-proven with bitcoin, which has not suffered from such blows to date.But no matter how secure a system we design, it will always have one point of failure: humans.The Heathrow Airport was fined for £120,000 ($155,000) when an employee lost a USB Drive containing 2.5 GB of sensitive files. No matter how secret those files were kept; without proper training and procedures in place, the system can still fail miserably.Security is a process, not an end state. And our primary enemy is “convenience.” Even the U.S. President is no exception. That’s why we reuse the same passwords on disparate websites or totally abandon them with two-factor authentication. In fact, the AT&T case had nothing to do with blockchain vulnerabilities; the victims had fallen for SIM swapping.SIM swapping is a technique used by hackers to trick (or even bribe) a telecom operator to redirect the phone number of the victim to the hacker’s SIM card. The hackers impersonate their target by providing fake IDs and claiming they have lost their phone and need their old number redirected to their “new” SIM card. From there, they can penetrate the target’s email and social media accounts, and extract valuable information about any other account that is insecurely stored there.For SIM swapping, the hacker only needs to know their target’s phone number, then pull off some social engineering to trick the operator. In an SS7 attack, even social engineering is not necessary, as hackers can use the attack to eavesdrop on SMS messages and steal any PIN codes that are sent to the victim’s phone during a login attempt. The only way to protect yourself against these measures, for now, is not to use cellphones for authentication—or keep one just for logins and never share its number with anyone.What makes this particularly important for cryptocurrencies is its nature. When hackers steal private data or even healthcare data, they still need to sell those accounts or start exploiting them before they can turn their gains into money—and in some cases, the victims can block those accounts or otherwise minimize the damage. But with crypto’s, they have immediate access to cash.In some cases, the hackers even ignored the funds they could have accessed in traditional banks. According to REACT Lieutenant John Rose, the attackers “are predominantly interested in targeting cryptocurrencies for the ease with which these funds can be laundered through online exchanges, and because the transactions can’t be reversed.”It is interesting to notice the pattern here: hackers attack central locations for gains and hide in the decentralized network for anonymity. In a way, blockchain is accomplishing exactly what it was supposed to do: removing single points of failure and create a network where anyone can trade freely.As we hear the calls for regulating blockchain, it is also important to remember the primary reason behind bitcoin’s birth: the failure of large central banks, which caused the depression of 2008.Eventually, it comes down to who do we trust? The central bodies, which are supposed to be the good guys but have sometimes shown they can turn evil, or the masses where hackers and fraudsters can also blend in?For blockchain supporters, the answer is clear: we cannot hope that the people in power always do the right thing, but we can give the masses more power to take corrective action. In other words, should we opt for a dictatorship and hope we will get a “good” dictator or do we believe democracy always prevails?It comes down to how we use technology. Blockchain has answers in itself.When the Ghash.io pool got close to controlling 51% of bitcoin mining power in 2014, the community reacted by leaving the pool—so much that the owners had to publicly announce that they “will take all necessary precautions to prevent reaching 51% of all hashing power, in order to maintain stability of the bitcoin network.”To protect against smart contract hacks, an Israeli cybersecurity startup called Safeblocks has created a decentralized web firewall that protects smart contracts from unauthorized transactions and malicious attacks in real time. The platform task is to monitor the smart contracts and examine the transaction requests as they come, approving or disapproving them based on the security exceptions the users have set. This way, users can put a limit on the number of transactions per day, capping withdrawals amount of even setting a designated address for withdrawal.The fundamental idea is that instead of relying on code audits, we have to measure the system in real-time and take action accordingly. This view is much closer to the “security is a process” principle. Only this time, blockchain is a part of this process.Assessing the breaches mentioned previously, it is clear that blockchain could not have prevented the SIM swapping or SS7 attacks—but it does present a system which is immune to surveillance: dark routing. This technique, as implemented by Mainframe, enables full data privacy, surveillance resistance and censorship resistance. It works by only partially disclosing the target destination, making the message go out to a number of nodes such that the target recipient cannot be singled out. However, only the target recipient can actually decrypt the message.Substratum has used this technique to penetrate China’s Great Firewall. The platform splits transmitted data into several parts and forwards them via nodes, using artificial intelligence to find the fastest routes. Combined with encryption, this creates a secure and uncensorable connection without using VPNs or Tor. “Our plan is to implement a term we call masquerading. We encrypt and wrap data into transactions that look similar to other patterns of web traffic,” explains Justin Tabb, the CEO of Substratum. “As we move further we will have more and more masqueraders in the hopes of never being identifiable.”Putting this system on the blockchain actually plays a crucial role. Eventually, VPN hosts are limited and costly. Tor is free of charge but the only incentive for anyone to use it would be anonymity. Blockchain, on the other hand, flips the entire equation. Here, the nodes can actually earn income by sharing their network. For instance, Substratum implements a model where you pay for content based on “clicks.” This decentralized version of the web empowers the nodes instead of the centralized players and has the potential to bring net neutrality back.Hackers circumvent these techniques, or even worse, use them in their own favor? Of course. Just as they can do with many other systems—even centralized ones. The most important takeaway is that security is a process. Blockchain is not good or evil. It can be used for both. But it is a step in the right direction."

The Federal Reserve states:“The resulting drop in asset prices might be particularly large, given that valuations appear elevated relative to historical levels.”…And…“Even if central bank policies are fully anticipated by the public, some adjustments could occur abruptly, contributing to volatility in domestic and international financial markets and strains in institutions,”This means that corporate bonds, many government bonds and the stock market all remain risky investments in the upcoming year.As I covered in yesterday’s article “Cryptocurrency Analysis: The U.S. Dollar Influences the Price”, there is a risk to the U.S. Dollar price of Cryptocurrencies as they are strongly tied. I also pointed out that the real estate market also has risks. In light of this, will the cryptocurrency industry survive?Jeffrey Sprecher says yes it will. He is the CEO of IntercontinentalExchange and Chairman of the New York Stock Exchange and he spoke at the Consensus Invest conference in New York on November 27th. Responding to the question of cryptocurrency’s survival:“I’d say the unequivocal answer is yes,” he said, adding that “we’re kind of agnostic to price.”There are still many roadblocks ahead for cryptocurrencies in 2019. The current SEC Chairman Jay Clayton wants to see better market surveillance and custody before a cryptocurrency-related ETF will be approved. Even though exchanges such as Gemini have added surveillance tools powered by the NASDAQ, and custody tools that are strong, leading advisors to the SEC remain skeptical:""We've seen some thefts around digital assets that make you scratch your head,"" Clayton said, ""We care that the assets underlying that ETF have good custody, and that they're not going to disappear.""The NASDAQ plans to add a futures market during the first three months of 2019. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission remains friendly to cryptocurrencies and is likely to issue final approval for the NASDAQ to begin trading futures. Traders will now be able to use a large exchange with higher volume to trade futures contracts in addition to the CME and CBOE exchanges.In the midst of all this, it is important to clearly understand the underlying cryptocurrency assets that are being traded. Presently, “market capitalization” is utilized as an important metric to judge the overall size and health of a cryptocurrency. Aat de Kwaasteniet writes in a Medium post that this value is meaningless when judging a cryptocurrency. As evidenced by Tron (TRX), by manipulating the count of coins outstanding between September 29, 2017 and October 8, 2017, they were able to jump from 98th place to 35th place even though the trading volume remained at about $50,000 to $200,000 per day. According to Aat’s analysis, other cryptocurrencies that have performed a similar manipulation strategy includes Ripple, EOS and Cardano.Bitcoin currently creates about 1,800 new coins daily. Ethereum creates about 19,000 coins daily. This means that there are approximately $7.2 million USD in new Bitcoins and $2 million USD in new Ethereums created daily based on today’s price. By volume, according to World Coin Index, Bitcoin transacts $3.56 Billion daily (4% of marketcap) and Ethereum transacts $1.38 Billion daily (10% of marketcap).World Coin Index screenshot from 11/28/2018The true measure of volume is hard to calculate because many exchanges support “off chain” transactions. Furthermore, some exchanges post misleading (zero cost, and other) trades that artificially inflate the volume metrics.Both Coinbase and Gemini now offer OTC trading for financial institutions, both are important steps towards broader adoption of cryptocurrencies as a trusted financial instrument. Such block trades would offer an important liquidity step for businesses seeking to settle large amounts of transactions at once.Still many short-term traders are expecting the U.S. Dollar rate to bitcoins to stay on the “moon math” path with the US. Dollar price of a bitcoin approaching something between $10,000 and $100,000 by January 2020.""Moon Math"" as of 11/28/2018With the State of Ohio, and other merchants using Bakkt planning to accept Bitcoin as a payment method next year, cryptocurrency’s future remains bright indeed.

The malware was responsible for causing carnage at a range of American health organizations as well as a large number of other U.S. businesses.The pair, Mohammad Mehdi Shah Mansouri and Faramarz Shahi Savandi, were accused of creating SamSam in late 2015. It was designed to infect a target’s network and lock up files on the affected computers. Then SamSam’s creators would demand payment of a set amount of Bitcoin to unlock those files. Victims were directed to sites hosted on the Tor Network, more widely known as the main home of the dark Web. In total, the Department of Justice claimed the hackers made $6 million worth of Bitcoin, cashing out at Iranian exchanges for real rial.Soon after they created SamSam, the Iranians found their first major American target, according to the indictment unsealed Wednesday. The unfortunate party was Mercer County Business in New Jersey. A month later, Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center became a SamSam victim. Many more followed in the health and government sectors.SamSam was still going strong this year. In March the City of Atlanta was hit. The local government spent $2.6 million recovering, even though it didn’t pay the ransom of $50,000 in Bitcoin. The City of Newark was another notable victim.FBI Wanted notice for Iranians accused of creating rampant ransomware.The most recent recorded attack came in September, when the computer network of the Port of San Diego was infected. According to data from British cybersecurity firm Sophos, other victims were located in Canada, the U.K., Australia and Belgium.While it wasn’t as damaging as either the WannaCry or NotPetya ransomware strains that caused havoc in 2017, SamSam’s operators appeared to be more targeted. They chose specific organizations and scanned their networks for specific weaknesses before launching attacks.But though Western intelligence agencies have blamed North Korea for WannaCry and Russia for NotPetya, it appears SamSam was purely a cybercriminal conspiracy. Two cybersecurity experts who’ve been watching the rise of Iran’s national offensive cyber capability said SamSam seemed to be purely criminal.“Every sector of our economy is a target of malicious cyber activity. But the events described in this Indictment highlight the urgent need for municipalities, public utilities, health care institutions, universities and other public organizations to enhance their cyber security,” said Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein.Mansouri and Savandi have now been placed on the FBI’s Most Wanted list. They remain at large and so were not available for comment.“They face arrest and extradition to the United States in many nations that honor the rule of law,” Rosenstein added."

and may be more open to a crypto rewards program. We know that ...","Dec 11, 2018,06:30am EST",Pexels,"For over a quarter of a century, I have been a loyalty consultant thinking about, speaking about and writing about customer loyalty. In this article, I want to break through the hype about blockchain to focus on what it can and can't do for your business.As participation in loyalty programs continues to lag, interest in the possibilities offered by a blockchain loyalty program is growing. There are both opportunities and challenges associated with decentralized ledgers. First, we'll look at the opportunities:Reward RedemptionBlockchain-based loyalty programs address a number of issues that typically drive customers away from traditional loyalty programs. Among them are problems with redeeming points before they expire and keeping track of multiple loyalty programs.Low redemption rates are a big problem for loyalty marketers. Members that are not redeeming are not actively engaged in the loyalty program. On the flip side, members who redeem points are more engaged, spend more and are more satisfied with loyalty programs.Blockchain allows a customer to store all points in a single wallet rather than trying to manage multiple programs. There would not be separate rules for acquiring and redeeming points from different loyalty programs as is currently the case.This lack of friction, in turn, allows customers to exchange tokens for a variety of different businesses and discounts or rewards. In a global loyalty study, 79% of participants said that choosing among several types of rewards is very appealing to them. Program providers still maintain control regarding how points are valued and dispersed and other elements, but their profitability relies less on customers redeeming fewer points.More FlexibilityWhen it comes to loyalty programs, customers value flexibility. With blockchain loyalty programs, customers would no longer have to wait to be awarded points but could potentially receive and redeem them in real time. Plus, blockchain rewards are easier to track and can be redeemed in smaller increments. There are also broader opportunities for engagement including local campaigns, partner offers, biometric authorization and targeted content.The data stored in the ledger is secure, structured and abundant. It is the perfect source for targeted content driven by big data analysis using artificial intellignce (AI). For example, AI can be used to create personalized messages for each customer with the right offer, right reward, and in real-time.Reduce FraudIf companies have sensitive private data, that information will not be stored on the blockchain but remain on legacy systems with which blockchain can interact. For network members, all the necessary information is stored on the ledger. All of this could lead to a reduction in loyalty fraud.Reduce Program CostsOne barrier in the expansion of loyalty programs is that doing so takes time and money. With a distributed ledger, this cost would be much lower. The savings can be passed on to the customer in the form of requiring a lower minimum balance for rewards points redemption or for more valuable customer experiences.ChallengesMany companies are already exploring the possibilities that a blockchain loyalty platform could offer. However, like any new technology, there are still many unanswered questions and elements that need further development or investigation.An Emerging TrendThere are a number of startup companies -- like Vexanium, Gift Jeenie, Qiibee and Loyela -- implementing blockchain loyalty programs. But overall, this type of program is still in its infancy. So far, a few large brands are experimenting with blockchain technology.Earlier this year, Singapore Airlines launched KrisPay, which allows members to transfer their KrisFlyer points to partner merchants using a digital wallet that can be accessed in real-time. American Express is also capitalizing on the transferability of blockchain to enable merchants to tie American Express reward points into their own products. Under that umbrella, online wholesaler Boxed is the first merchant to test the blockchain-based rewards.And Chanticleer Holdings, which owns burger restaurants like American Burger Co., BGR and a handful of Hooters restaurants, wants to empower customers to redeem Merit, its reward cryptocurrency, at any of their brands or trade them with friends. The company intends to give its rewards members more control over their loyalty program to improve their customer experience.Data PrivacyIt will be necessary to take steps to protect customer data and not just keep up with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) regarding data protection. Only limited information can be stored on a shared network. The rest, which needs customer permission in order to be collected, must be stored separately.Consumer Learning CurveMillennials tend to be interested in Bitcoin and other digital currencies and may be more open to a crypto rewards program. We know that customers don't always fully utilize and participate in loyalty programs as it is, and while blockchain should eliminate some of those barriers, a significant learning curve remains. Customers will also need to download their digital wallet and set up their accounts.ScalabilityAt its current level, blockchain technology may struggle with demand. Only three or four transactions per second are possible with Bitcoin, and even Ethereum can only manage 15. The infrastructure as it exists may not be sufficient for a large-scale blockchain loyalty program.As an emerging technology, blockchain loyalty platforms have enormous potential along with drawbacks. Savvy business leaders would be well advised to stay on top of what happens with companies that are piloting blockchain loyalty programs to how well these programs perform compared to traditional loyalty programs."

like ...","Nov 29, 2018,06:12am EST",These companies keep the eco-system of blockchain alive.,"When you write about blockchain and cryptocurrency you tend to get a lot of emails offering CEO interviews, background on emerging ICOs and everything in between.I thought it would be interesting to go through some of the companies who have reached out to me and take a look at exactly what they do and who they serve. I was amazed to see that a full-service industry now exists to propel that startup (the one you haven’t heard of yet) to glory, and so I dived a bit deeper to figure out just what help a successful ICO might need.Indeed, the industry isn’t made up of blockchain companies alone; there are vital supporting services that make up the ecosystem. Despite having a science-fiction/futuristic ring to it— the blockchain industry is no lone wolf. In the world of financial technology, it really is evolve or die. So here are my top 3 from each section of the blockchain and crypto industry of who I believe are pushing the boundaries, from accounting services to tokenomics. Accounting ServicesPreparing and examining financial records is no easy task and in a relatively new industry, some of these expenses and purchases may be foreign to accountants who have not worked with blockchain and cryptocurrency companies before. Here are a few of the best crypto-accounting companies out there who have managed to get their heads around it.GoldCommerce CPA specializes in helping Bitcoin and cryptocurrency users around tax season. The commerce CPA staff are familiar with a number of cryptocurrencies ranging from big names like Bitcoin and Ethereum to smaller altcoins like Zcash, and their team can help consumers with auditing, accounting, and consulting as well.SilverThe team at Azran financial are considered thought leaders when it comes to cryptocurrency accounting solutions and taxation. From ICO’s to STO’s to cryptocurrency airdrops, the team at Azran has a deep understanding of blockchain technologies and its relationship with regulation.BronzeCrypto CPAs is an accounting firm that specializes in blockchain and cryptocurrency. The firm services individuals with cryptocurrency investments, and ICO projects in need of tax and accounting services. ConferencesCommunity building is an essential part of reaching out to the mainstream audience and ensuring that a blockchain project maintains enough following to keep going for many years to come; because of this, companies organize blockchain events on a regular basis, especially since cryptocurrency enthusiasts are known to spend large sums of money for these events.GoldThe United Nations (UN) has been looking to blockchain technology to solve social issues. For those who are looking for ideas on what to tokenize, high-level forums such as those by the UN would provide very valuable insights. After all, the best products in the world are those that deliver a real need.SilverSilicon Valley wouldn’t be caught dead behind everybody else, particularly with a technology so big, that even those who don’t understand it keep talking about it. On November 28-29, the ambitiously named event, “The World’s Largest Blockchain Conference and Exhibition,” will bring big names in the industry together.BronzeDubai has always been on a quest to position itself as one of the most forward-thinking cities in the world. The Dubai International Blockchain Summit on August 9 hosted over 5,000 delegates, including several start-up founders, at Atlantis the Palm Hotel.DevelopmentsIn an industry as new as blockchain and cryptocurrency, it can be challenging to come across individuals with the expertise to develop blockchain-based software and hardware. Fortunately, there are a number of companies in the industry willing to assist you with this task.Gold Tecsynt helps companies create blockchain-based mobile phone applications. The team at Tecsynt are well-versed in blockchain and cryptocurrency and can help clients when it comes to developing programs and making decisions. A few of Tecsynt’s clients include Freemo, Hawkist, and DermDash. SilverToptal connects their clients to a pool of talent that can create the blockchain based software and hardware that they are looking for. After hearing about project goals, Toptal leverages their vast network of blockchain engineers and connects customers to developers that are the perfect fit for their project.BronzePeerbits offers a range of blockchain development services; from private blockchain development to wallet development solutions, Peerbits’ team of experienced blockchain specialists can tackle any problem their clients are facing and create solutions.Investment Funds The amount of money coming into the blockchain industry has been quite overwhelming. Some even predict that the bitcoin market cap alone will shoot up to the trillion-dollar mark at some point in the near future and financial professionals have taken notice of the opportunity. Unsurprisingly, traditional investors have been seeping into blockchain investing, and investment funds are an easy transition that saves investors from a lot of headaches. GoldProtocol Ventures was started in 2017 by serial entrepreneur and venture capitalist Rick Marini. Protocol Ventures is an investment fund that invests in cryptocurrency hedge funds. The company identifies the top ten hedge funds based on historical and expected performance, quality of fund managers, and quality of investment strategies, and backs these companies in hopes of healthy returns. SilverPantera Capital is a blockchain-focused investment fund founded in 2013, making it the first US Bitcoin investment firm in history. They have a portfolio of industry heavyweights, including Bitcoin.org, ShapeShift, Augur, Abra, Civic, Omisego, and Ripple.BronzeBased in London, Eterna Capital was formed by a group of ex BlackRock analysts with a solid understanding of traditional markets and blockchain tech. The fund is special as it focuses on projects and teams that value social impact and incorporate it into their business models.  Marketing AgenciesDespite what some may believe, the success or failure of a company isn’t always about being the best, or “getting there first.” Many times, success is bolstered by other less quantifiable factors, like user experience and community relations.An explosive marketing strategy can help start-ups make their entry into the market, even when it’s already crowded with industry giants; this cannot be truer in the blockchain industry. Keeping an organization in and ahead of the game is a constant investment that should never be undervalued, pre and post-ICO. GoldMaking the top of the list is Verma Media, which, within only about a year propelled over 80 projects into over $220 million in funding. With Verma’s track record, it quickly became a household name for blockchain founders. The “decentralized marketing agency” offers full-service marketing, landing big clients like Consensus, Patron, Muirfield, and Substratum, among many others.SilverWachsman PR, founded in 2015, prides itself with its media relations services, strategic advisory, event production, and “crisis communications”—something all-too-familiar with all the hacks and controversies the blockchain industry experiences on a regular basis. Some of Wachsman’s most well-known clients are Dash, Coindesk, Steemit, and the controversial Bitfinex—which in itself would have been rigorously testing Wachsman’s damage control skills. BronzeAnother blockchain-focused PR firm worth watching is Melrose, a California-based agency strategically located in Silicon Beach, where over 500 tech startup companies reside.The firm has worked with several startups focusing on fields like AI, healthcare, advertising, and online gaming. Among their clients are SingularityNET, DAO.Casino, and Blockdaemon.Smart ContractsSmart contracts are the blood of decentralized applications. Any flaws within this code could spell trouble for a company and its founders—legal, financial, and reputational. But at the same time, experienced blockchain developers are hard to come by. Fortunately, some have taken it upon themselves to put some order into the developer shortage by offering these services through firms. And because these jobs are highly complex and utterly crucial (multi-million-dollar hack level crucial), it’s best to leave this job to the experts.GoldHosho.io nabs the number one spot on this list due to their reliable security services and track record in smart contract auditing. The blockchain security firm, comprised of experienced white hat hackers, is a partner to the Ethereum Enterprise Alliance. SilverUK-based firm Zeppelin Solutions boasts of having networks worth over $4.5 billion built using their systems. Apart from security audits for decentralized applications (DApps), the company also builds open-source infrastructure to make it easier for new developers to create complex blockchain applications.BronzeBlockchain outsourcing company Prolitus is an ISO 9001 & ISO/IEC 27001:2013 certified firm and is a partner to Google and Amazon Web Services. They currently operate in Ireland, USA, and India.Tokenomics StrategyNot only did blockchain technology forge the birth of parallel industries, but it has also given rise to the creation of entirely new fields of study—tokenomics being one of them. The field governs the purpose, mechanics, and economic design of a token ecosystem, as well as the incentive structure within it. This is a crucial pre-launch aspect in an entirely new “science,” therefore tokenomics specialists are highly sought after, yet not easily found.GoldYeoman’s Capital is an investment firm created by early Bitcoin adopters. “We only invest if we can also make a meaningful impact as advisors,” their website says. And to show everyone they mean business, the firm clearly states, “No Free Lambos,” on their website. “We work hard & deploy our own money.”SilverBoasting a team of several blockchain analysts, advisers, and technologists, International Blockchain Consulting (IBC) specifically positions their firm as one whose niche is in a tokenomics advisory.BronzeBlockchainSaw is a blockchain development firm that also offers smart contract auditing—something the industry is in dire need of. Unlike investment firms and consultancies that provide advisory services, BlockchainSaw does the dirty work for token creators."

Bitcoin’s price was of  $0.003 each at that time. Hanyecz pizzas would now be worth more than $60mn at current market prices. This kicked off cryptocurrencies real-world use as a means of payment.Fast forward 8 years and we still are nowhere near mass adoption as a form of payment in the crypto and blockchain market. 2018 has been a nightmare year for investors as the markets tanked by more than 90% from their all-time highs with several projects put on hold due to the decimation of funds available. However, there seem to be some interesting solutions on the horizon and one of them looks to be appearing in the shipping and logistics world.The coin is called Bytom (symbol: BTM ) and it is purporting to bridge the worlds of traditional finance and the blockchain with the purpose of supporting the interaction of multiple assets. It made its first real-world transaction in October 2018 and which took place on what is claimed to be the largest e-commerce shipping platform, Sea RatesA payment for the consignment of goods from China to Korea has actually been successful with the use of the Bytom blockchain. The total cost was only 74 Bytom roughly USD 17 and this is, far less than through a payment made with US dollars for the same consignment In December 2018, two months later, another consignment from China to Ukraine worth USD 5,452 was settled using Bytom. This transaction took place once again on the SeaRates platform and confirmed Bytom as a means of payment in a real-life use case. Which is something that is really needed in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space is mass adoption is really to happen.This encouraged SeaRates to adopt Bytom as a means of payment and settlement tool thus opening an interesting opportunity in this sector. SeaRates is supposedly one of the most established logistics company based in the UK. It has over 600,000 users, 40,000 carriers and 250,000 shippers. Its presence both online and online app attracts over 9 million requests from over 200 countries and territories around the world.It now seems that SeaRates adopted Bytom to address problems such as exchange rate fluctuations and commission fees for US dollar payments. Bytom is the only cryptocurrency that is supported on the SeaRates platform which instantly translates into global adoption.Site users who choose to make payments on the SeaRates website using cryptocurrency are able to check balances and trade history, print and receive freight bills, and most importantly, payments are settled in just a few seconds. A pilot study demonstrated that a transaction using Bytom on SeaRates only took 0.3 seconds. In addition, there wasn’t any loss of value in the overall freight value after several USD exchanges with Bytom.According to sources, SeaRates also works with banks in Malta and Switzerland and together with Bytom Blockchain, they have set up a built-in exchange for real-time crypto-fiat transactions. This enables both shipper and forwarder to execute instant a Bytom/fiat exchange with almost zero cost within the SeaRates online platform.SeaRates is apparently also collaborating with Bytom to develop an escrow service using a smart contract on the Bytom Blockchain. The objective is to eliminate complicated and time-consuming international settlement processes. At present, the global logistics of commodities depends mainly on shipping as a means of transportation, with the price considered as relatively low but these transactions take considerable time, during which shipping costs may increase along with the volatile exchange rate. A report in 2016 by Natixis shows that10% reductions in railway (2%), air (5.5%) and maritime costs (1.1%) would increase trade. Adopting Bytom as a means payment may effectively reduce the exchange cost arising from exchange rate fluctuations that may even be an effective catalyst to facilitate international trade. The technology still needs to be tested however the future does look pretty promising"

In addition to the major ones like Bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple, there are digital currencies of every stripe, but only one that offers a unique vision of freedom, equality and a punk rock philosophy. ","SPINDLE (SPD) was launched in 2017 as both a cryptocurrency and an asset management platform dedicated to transparency through the use of blockchain technology. In its initial coin offering, about $100 million worth of funds were raised, making it one of the biggest ICOs ever in Japan. On May 19, 2018, SPINDLE began trading on five major global exchanges. Now it’s aiming for even bigger growth as its developers begin operations in London. Masamitsu Hirai, CEO of BLACK STAR CAPITAL LTD. and Shuich Uda, founder of SPINDLEThinking outside the boxThe startup company behind SPINDLE is BLACK STAR CAPITAL LTD., now based in London. With a small staff of only 15, it has positioned itself as an innovative new force in the crypto industry. “Under the conventional financial system, professional investors would judge whether the information they were getting was correct or not,” says CEO Masamitsu Hirai. “Ordinary people can’t judge whether this information is true or not. I think blockchain technology can be used to provide fair and trustworthy information to investors. That’s what SPINDLE represents.” The SPINDLE project is the brainchild of founder Shuichi Uda, an entrepreneur with around 15 years of experience in the mainstream financial services industry, including time as a hedge fund player in London. While he had long helped wealthy investors grow their assets, he began to feel that their exclusive access to vehicles such as hedge funds and pre-IPO startups were contributing to inequality in the markets. A turning point in his career was the 2008 collapse of the investment bank Lehman Brothers, which resulted in the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history.  “The Lehman shock was an epoch-making scandal,” says Uda. “Traditional financial regimes broke down as people lost their assets. The government was unable to help ordinary citizens, something I was reminded of after the 2011 earthquake that devastated Japan. I saw the good and the bad of the financial world and always wondered whether it was making people happy or not.”   The Lehman shock and the Great Recession erased billions of dollars worth of investments and affected countless people around the world. Uda decided that at the heart of the problem was a breakdown in trust between investors and the bankers who were responsible for investment vehicles, such as assets based on subprime mortgages. Human fallibility played a big role in the global financial crisis, but Uda was also deeply skeptical of the ability of centralized institutions, such as central banks, to solve fundamental problems in the financial system. Then, around 2011, he discovered Bitcoin.   Investor matchmaking“I was attracted to Bitcoin because I never liked how values in the Japanese market were determined by conventional authorities,” says Uda. “As a longtime fan of alternative music, and a musician myself, it also appealed to my punk sensibility. I really thought that Bitcoin could be a disruptor in the financial industry, and I felt that was just wonderful.” Along with mainstream players such as banks and retail companies, cryptocurrencies have recently drawn the interest of hedge fund managers. Hundreds of crypto hedge funds have emerged over the past year, a situation Uda likens to the 1970s, when many hedge funds were established amid a lack of regulations. Against this backdrop, Uda established BLACK STAR CAPITAL LTD. with Hirai, his colleague from Funai Research Institute.“We believe that economic activities in society should be principally free,” Hirai and colleagues wrote in a series of white papers that outline SPINDLE. In addition to this libertarian stance, SPINDLE is positioned as a low-cost, transparent and useful tool for everyday investors. In fact, the token has been described by some as the Tinder of cryptocurrencies because it will be used to directly match investors with funds that are suited to them. “In addition to trading on the market, SPINDLE can be used as a token for investment vehicles,” says Hirai. “We’re now developing a platform connecting SPINDLE holders with investment vehicles including hedge funds.” Global ambitionsWith the aim of making SPINDLE a global tool for investing, Uda and Hirai hope to gain 1% of the market value hedge fund operating assets, which would be about $24 billion. To meet this ambitious target, they have established an office in Shanghai and have been actively promoting SPD outside of Japan. They also assembled a suite of expert advisors with a diverse set of backgrounds. One of BLACK STAR CAPITAL LTD.’s boldest moves, however, was to relocate their headquarters from Japan to London. BLACK STAR CAPITAL LTD. sees tremendous opportunities for growth in Europe due to its enormous talent pool of engineers and designers, as well as its positive atmosphere surrounding the crypto industry in general. With these factors, the industry is bound to expand and attract even more talent, creating a virtuous circle for growth.  “Japan was the second-largest market for altcoins after the U.S. but it has shrunk by two-thirds since January,” says Uda. “Maybe half of the crypto investors have left the market. Regulations are a major factor.”“Since we’re now developing our system, it’s better for us to have easier access to engineers and investment vehicles by being in London,” says Hirai. “If the industry is shrinking, it won’t attract new engineers—they’re being drawn to the industry in places like Germany and Poland. We have global vision for SPINDLE and we want to be in a global position to carry it out.”As BLACK STAR CAPITAL LTD. prepares to launch its innovative SPINDLE Wallet later this year, now is the perfect time to check out this unique tool and the investment opportunities it presents. "

Blockchain",https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeldelcastillo/2018/12/04/signature-launches-institutional-payments-using-permissioned-ethereum-blockchain/,"Originally popularized for powering the bitcoin cryptocurrency without the 
need of banks, blockchains and other distributed ledgers are now ...","Dec 4, 2018,08:00am EST",Signature Bank logo displayed on a smartphone.,"Commercial bank Signature Bank is launching a new payments platform for institutional clients powered by a permissioned version of the ethereum blockchain.Developed in partnership with trueDigital Holdings in New York, the Signet Platform lets Signature Bank clients move money in 30 seconds, 24-hours a day, seven days a week by converting U.S. dollars into tokens compliant with ethereum’s ERC-20 standard.Traditional corporate payments using the Swift interbank platform or the Automated Clearing House (ACH) network  can take as long as three days and are generally unavailable during the weekend, frequently resulting in lost business when opportunities require more swift reactions.While this early implementation of blockchain is limited in that only Signature customers can use the always-on service, it is also part of a larger plan that could eventually see the bank directly connecting to others without the need of an intermediary.Signature Bank cofounder and CEO sees the adoption of the private version of ethereum as a case of disrupt or be disrupted.“We have to do this, otherwise we’re not going to exist,” said DePaolo. “If you’re not involved in blockchain, in five years, you won’t be around as a bank.”Originally popularized for powering the bitcoin cryptocurrency without the need of banks, blockchains and other distributed ledgers are now being pursued as a way to simplify a number of middle- and back-office workflows in banking and other industries.Unlike other ethereum tokens that comply with ethereum’s ERC-20 standard, Signature Bank’s digitized dollars, or signets, are designed to only work on the bank's proprietary Signet Platform, and are not expected to interoperate with other exchanges and services built to accommodate the standard. However, a statement provided to Forbes by trueDigitital indicated this is just the first step to adding other currencies and pairs. “This will significantly reduce costs, counterparty risk and settlement times,"" said trueDigital founder and CEO Sunil Hirani in a statement.The Signet Platform will open to commercial clients of Signature Bank on January 1, 2019 at 12:01 a.m. ET. At the time of launch the transactions will be free, but they also require a minimum balance of $250,000. Deposits held within the Signet Platform are eligible for FDIC insurance, up to the legal insurable amounts defined by the FDIC. Because the platform is restricted to Signature Bank clients, all users must pass the bank’s anti-money-laundering and know-your-customer compliance.Launched in May 2001, Signature Bank generated $155.4 million net income for the 2018 third quarter and now manages $45 billion in assets.Also announced today, the Signet Platform has been approved by the New York State Department of Financial Services, making it the first bank to receive regulatory permission to use blockchain in this capacity. “New York continues to support and help advance innovation through sound state regulation,” said Department of Financial Services Superintendent Maria T. Vullo, in a statement. “And with products such as Signet, which provide lower-cost ways for businesses to efficiently make payments.”While the service is free at the time of launch, DePaolo said he wasn’t sharing plans for how they might monetize the service in the future.The launch of Signet isn’t the first time the founder of little-known trueDigital Holdings made headlines. Prior to partnering with Signature Bank, trueDigital founder Sunil Hirani founded Digital Asset Holdings, which has raised $107 million venture capital, and is best known for winning the contract to help the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) replatform its CHESS electronic-book-entry register for securities.“The launch of Signet will address an obvious need that diverse ecosystems have for exchanging funds repeatedly with the same counterparty,” said Hirani, who faces tough competition in the space. Earlier this year Hirani filed a lawsuit that alleges 11 banks conspired to boycott his trueEX interest rate swaps platform. In fact, Swift itself has also been exploring blockchain, though it deemed the technology not ready for the high volumes their workload requires. Other competition is also coming from Ripple, a venture-backed startup using its own proprietary distributed ledger similar to a permissioned version of ethereum.While Ripple is designed to leverage the XRP cryptocurrency as a way to increase liquidity, DePaolo isn’t interested in directly leveraging crypto any time soon. As is, the Signet platform is capable of handling “thousands of transactions per second,” according to a company representative, but can be scaled to accommodate “tens of thousands of transactions per second.”Going forward, DePaolo believes that other banks will likely offer similar intra-bank payments solutions that streamline back- and middle-office workflows, and eventually connect directly to each other.“I believe that consolidation of financial institutions will be swift,” said DePaolo. “I think that consolidation will occur because there will be a number of banks that say, we can’t do this, we don’t want to invest in it.”Free Webcast: Join Forbes' crypto expert, Jack Tatar, on December 18 at 2:00PM EST and find out what you can expect from bitcoin and other crypto assets in 2019 as well as what companies are benefiting from blockchain technology.

It's an interesting story, it's just highly annoying that it happened to me.First things first. Like many others, I was in the latter stages of the crypto wave and only started becoming interested in them a couple of years ago.Blockchain seemed revolutionary, Ether looked as if it could more than emulate Bitcoin because of Smart Contracts, so why not quietly invest in a future nest egg? I had time on my hands, so this was always a long play... and not a big one.I learnt quickly, heard that crypto exchanges were hacked regularly, so it would be advisable to store my Ether in a wallet via a public key and a private one. I could upload funds using my public key (open to the world), but only I would know the private key.So far, so encrypted. Both keys were 40 characters long and I decided to use Myetherwallet to store my Ether; friends in the industry had assured me this was the best one.As directed, I printed off my private key, kept it securely in my desk (whoops, just gave it away again) and then came up with what I thought was a masterstroke.Some years ago when I lived in Goa, I met some very interesting people, one of whom was a notorious (and somewhat garrulous) drug dealer.He told me over a few beers that whenever he wanted to pass on a secret message, he would give his Gmail log-in and password to an associate and that individual could access the appropriate message in Gmail drafts.Nothing would be sent over the internet, so nobody would know, so it was as safe as proverbial houses. Good enough for a paranoid drug dealer, good enough for me; that's where I stored my private key.Moreover, I split the key into ten different sets of four characters and encrypted it my own way. Whenever I accessed the wallet, I would scrunch the characters together, cut-and-paste, access my wallet, then clear my browser history, then rearrange them differently. Clever old me.Clever, not. This, apparently, was how the hackers found my private key. So if you're thinking of storing your private key (or talking to fellow drug dealers), then Gmail drafts is a very bad idea. Clearly, I found this out too late; you have no excuses.Crypto wallets and exchanges are mutually exclusive and do not provide security.What happened next was insane and intense. When I next logged in, I quickly discovered that I'd been cleaned out a week earlier. The crypto cupboard was bare.Like any other burglary, this was an intensely stressful experience, so I activated my network of great people. Black hats, white hats, blockchain aces, crypto genii, high-networks individuals with access to the top, everybody I could think of.Information came quickly. The Ether had been moved to a new public key address, but had not moved for seven days. This meant it could have been malware that had scraped the private key (but didn't know how to move it to an exchange) or the thieves were biding their time.Unfortunately, they bided their time for another six days, but I was told 'not to worry'. This was blockchain and if the funds were moved to an exchange then I would be alerted, the thieves would be easy to track down.Then they moved and six days later I was alerted that they were transfering my funds (along with others) to the Binance exchange. That transaction had to be stopped because no blockchain transaction can be reversed. Simple surely, the exchange could just block that transaction.The next six hours were crazy, it was if the whole world was trying to help me out. Over the course of that evening, the odds of me blocking the transaction veered between 5 per cent to 40, down to 20, up to 70, down to 30 and finally a big, fat zero.Myetherwallet were sympathetic, but said there was nothing they could do, they did not have the ability to stop movements, even if they were suspicious. I spoke to Myetherwallet CEO Kosala Hemachandra in a panic as the heist continued its less than merry way.Remember we are an open source wallet that doesn't hold any user funds, so any compromise of funds like this may be a result of using a lookalike phishing site. We have the highest security measures available in the market so that our users are protected against malicious actors.Well, that was nice to know, but it didn't help me much, so I turned to Binance, but was presented with a website request for a 'ticket number' and they would get back to me in 72 hours.Seventy-two hours? I wanted something done within 72 seconds. I was told to expect a reply, which came 24 hours later, and a request for a law enforcement number to whom I had needed to report the crime.I live in the UK, not North America. Law enforcement means the Police and while I appreciate the work the Police do, I don't think any Police force in this country would even understand what had happened to me.This to them would just be another burglary and if they did know enough about crypto, being informed that I had left my private key in my Gmail drafts was as good as leaving a window open in my house. I probably deserved it.I later caught up with Wei Zhou, Binance CFO at this month's Blockchain Summit in Malta and he said there had an increase in thefts such as mine over the last couple of months describing it as a 'last grab'; hackers knew the crypto community was beefing up security.We work very hard to ensure the safety and security of funds on Binance and Trust Wallet. Our hope is that all users are informed on best practices to ensure the safety of their own storage and accounts. We work closely with law enforcement agencies around the world to help users recover funds, so in case of stolen funds, we encourage users to file reports right away with law enforcement.It will be interesting to find out just how many times Binance has co-operated to get theirs users' funds back, but Zhou assured me that Binance wanted this relationship with law enforcement to be more efficient and they're working on it.I have seen the price of Ether plummet in the six weeks since I was hacked, so the pain has lessened over this period of time, but while I've been an idiot, I'm not exactly clueless in how this all works.For the average and traditional investor however, the volatility of cryptocurrencies and its current (and brutal) bear market are enough to put most of them off investing in crypto.Add stories such as mine and the eventual creep of regulation, the crypto world right now seems to be a very dangerous place to play.On the other hand, I'm still a believer and while I've been burnt once, I may yet return. In the interim, the thieves have got away with it and whether this is a 'last grab', whether I'm a total loser or whether better security is coming, the warning is clear.Never, at any time, store your private key anywhere on your computer or your cellphone; you are not safe. Moreover, forget using Gmail drafts for anything else other than drug-dealing... it's a mug's game.[Disclosure: I do not currently hold any Ether... or any other cryptocurrency]"

ASIC-resistance movements, the world can be cold and unforgiving.","Dec 13, 2018,08:00am EST",Getty,"“Anarchy is what the world makes of it” – Alexander Wendt“Chaos is a ladder” - Petyr 'Littlefinger' BaelishThe Big QuestionAs we turn the page on a somber 2018 there will be many articles discussing the state of crypto and distilling the key questions and concerns for 2019. For instance, we will continue to wonder when blockchains will have the throughput to handle multiple applications at scale, and developers and enthusiasts will keep debating the best use cases for crypto and which “blockchain is best”.However, another key question that must be addressed is: At a structural level, will all of the various participants in the space find a workable model of collaboration and interaction to support development and growth in the future? Or, on the other hand, will the space devolve into a series of contentious arguments, debates, and conflicts. After all, there is no arbiter of last resort in crypto, and just like global politics, the space is anarchic. Fortunately, anarchy does not have to be a four-letter word, but it cannot be disregarded either.When asked about how collaboration in the space will look in the long term, many respond with truisms and platitudes such as “we are all on the same team” and “a rising tide lifts all boats”. Enthusiasts also point to “open sourcing” code as a way of signaling intent to “be a team player” and focus on the “greater good”. These talking points are further buttressed by efforts at collaboration among major players in the space, such as Hyperledger and the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance partnering together.Turning the Page on the Crypto 'Era of Good Feelings'This atmosphere of collaboration is admirable, and for the time being it has been sufficient. There was enough “blue ocean” for everyone, and companies that raised money via ICOs amassed war chests that seemingly provided them with runway for years. It seemed as if the “Crypto Roaring 20’s” would never end.This largesse is probably no better epitomized than with what that transpired at ConsenSys, who thanks to founder Joe Lubin’s goodwill reached up to 1,200 employees and incubated 50+ projects, despite almost none being financially independent. However, Joe recently announced that ConsenSys is going to be cutting up to 13% of its workforce and will rededicate himself and ConsenSys to being financially responsible. Put another way, ConsenSys’ and its various spokes are going to be treated like real companies set off into the wild.The same could be said for everyone else in space.This means that players in the crypto space will start bumping into each other and there will be a fight for survival among firms with limited runway. As evidenced by the acrimony that transpired following the initial “Blocksize debate”, the recent Bitcoin Cash fork, and the ASIC-resistance movements, the world can be cold and unforgiving. It should be – it is anarchic.Using Modern International Relations Theory to Create a Structural Theory for BlockchainDoes this mean that crypto is ultimately doomed to chaos? No, but finding a more robust answer to this question depends on how one sees the world. Fortunately, modern international relations theory offers a useful framework to make such determinations.There are three main schools of thought:RealismRealists see the world in Hobbesian zero-sum terms where it is in a state of perpetual conflict. Under realism what is good for one entity is bad for another, and there is no middle ground. There are opportunities for collaboration (i.e. alliances like NATO), but this type of cooperation is often short-lived and has a very acute focus. A particular strain of realism that has come to prominence in recent years is known as “offensive realism”, which was theorized by University of Chicago Professor John Mearsheimer in his book The Tragedy of Great Power Politics. Mearsheimer argues that in an anarchic world with no hierarchy states and actors will continually seek opportunities to gain power over their rivals because they must rely solely on themselves for security. This is admittedly a pessimistic outlook.LiberalismOn the other hand, liberal institutionalists (not to be confused with liberal/progressive parties in domestic politics), do not see the world in the same zero-sum terms. They reject the theory of great power politics and instead focus on seeking opportunities for international collaboration that provide mutual benefits. A key mechanism utilized to implement their world view are institutions, such as the UN or EU. Liberals also strongly believe that economic co-dependence reduces the propensity for conflict, as does the spread of common ideals such as democracy. There is even a theory that democracies, especially mature ones, do not go to war with each other because each government is tempered by its respective constituents, known as the “Democratic Peace Theory”.ConstructivismThe final noteworthy school of thought is constructivism.  Constructivism differs from both realism and liberalism in the sense that leading thinkers in the space believe that all international relations are the results of created social constructs and there is no inherent need for zero-sum great power politics or liberal institutionalists that seek to create transnational institutions in an effort to rein in innate desires for power consolidation. Constructivists, such as Alexander Wendt, feel that ""that the structures of human association are determined primarily by shared ideas rather than material forces, and that the identities and interests of purposive actors are constructed by these shared ideas rather than given by nature"".So, is there a dominant theory? If so, what does that mean for crypto? Unfortunately, as one might expect there is no single discipline of study that has proven to be above reproach. For instance, while the strategy of containment employed by the US against the USSR during the Cold War is deeply rooted in realism and largely credited with maintaining a tense peace during the second half of the 20th century, it is not without criticisms. For instance, it cannot explain the “Democratic Peace Theory” or that many countries in the early 1990’s and even today (current President Donald Trump notwithstanding) do not feel the need to protect themselves against the US despite it being the dominant superpower for the last 25 years.Institutionalists point to successes such as the fact that no major countries in Europe have gone to war with each other since 1945 as a result of European integration, something that truly would have been inconceivable 100 years prior, but their theories fail to hold up when one considers the number of conflicts that the UN (the closest thing we have to a world government) fails to prevent. Additionally, there are too many instances to count when democracies go to war with each other. Finally, economic interdependence does not necessarily prevent conflict or a rising of tensions. The European economy in the 20th century was heavily integrated, and today US/Chinese tensions are not being tempered by their close economic ties.Looking AheadSo, where do we go from here? Is crypto ultimately doomed to conflict and a devolution into a zero-sum game? Not necessarily, but at the same time taking actions such as building massive consortiums and partnering indiscriminately to align economic interests will not necessarily ensure a stable or prosperous future. We should not approach the space with rose-colored glasses and expect a smooth transition into a decentralized utopia.Looking ahead, it is unlikely that there will be one dominant player or platform in the space. If there was the more likely scenario is that the entire industry will collapse given the concerns about 51% attacks or the fact if there was one major platform it would likely be unwieldy. What is more likely to transpire is that there will be a period of consolidation and choosing of sides in the space as use cases and models become more defined.  This will happen because companies and advocates will face pressure to “go to market”, scale up, and demonstrate value the value of blockchain technology.There will also continue to be battles among competing chains and platforms, as hashing power and network security is truly a zero-sum proposition. As evidence one only needs to look at the scale up in mining power on each side that coincided with the recent Bitcoin Cash hard fork. These will continue to be acrimonious, much of which will be played out in public display.However, crypto does have one significant advantage that the geopolitical system does not – a shared sense of identity and purpose. This gives us reason for optimism. While advocates may differ on certain specifics of this ideology, there is a common belief that the space needs to be decentralized and that we all succeed or fail together. With this mindset, there is enough space for a constellation of multiple differentiated blockchains and protocols, provided that they each have a clear and dedicated purpose. The space will also have a higher likelihood of success if and when these differing platforms reach a level of maturity and scale that they truly are self-sustaining. At that point it would be largely impractical to directly attack each other’s chains, and they will settle into a more traditional competitive landscape based on economic terms.So, there is a lot of reason for hope, but the transition to crypto maturity will not be without conflict. Fortunately, this is natural and not insurmountable."

Major retailers and corporations like IBM and Wal-mart are pursuing a variety of applications for the technology. Smaller, independent ventures are plentiful as well. Use cases range from supply chain tracking, documenting land ownership, and redefining healthcare.Despite the hype, and like any new technology, blockchain is not without its deficits. Now, thanks to an algorithm invented by Leemon Baird, distributed ledger technology (DLT) is moving beyond the limitations of blockchain. It appears possible that the solution to blockchain’s unsolved challenges may lie in what Baird calls “hashgraph.”Those familiar with blockchain know that the technology is just one type of DLT. DLT refers to systems that use consensus algorithms to replicate data across multiple sites or nodes. In other words, data is processed by every node on the network rather than through one central hub.Based on the outcomes of each node processing data, a consensus can be reached to validate the data. The consensus is stored in each node. With blockchain, data is stored in blocks that are connected in a chain. However, not all DLTs store data in blocks, and not all DLTs have the same qualities, aside from having a distributed ledger structure.Baird, hashgraph’s inventor, has spent over two decades as a computer scientist. He has co-founded multiple startups—most recently, a startup named Hedera, based on his hashgraph algorithm. Hedera’s co-founder and CEO, Mance Harmon is a technology entrepreneur and research scientist. The two have worked together for many years, including co-founding Swirlds, a developer platform for hashgraph applications.Several members of the Hedera team, including the co-founders, chatted with Forbes contributor, Jefferson Nunn, at the Hedera18 Hackathon about what hashgraph and Hedera have to offer.Just as Bitcoin was built to enable peer-to-peer transactions and eliminate the need for a third party, hashgraph is“a way for people who don't know or trust each other to securely collaborate and transact online without the need for a trusted intermediary.” As described in a bit more detail by Baird and Harmon on the website of Swirlds:“The goal of a distributed consensus algorithm is to allow a community of users to come to an agreement on the order in which some of them generated transactions, when no single member is trusted by everyone. In this way, it is a system for generating trust, when individuals do not already trust each other.”Currently, most online transactions involve a third party due to the lack of trust. However, involving third parties often complicates and slows transaction processes. Furthermore, these third parties are not infallible, and their centralized structure has inherent risks.Current data and transaction systems rely on centralized servers. For instance, all of a bank’s transactions run through a central server. All of the data collected by Google is recorded in a central location. This structure, unfortunately, is vulnerable in terms of hacking and corruption. Evidence of this vulnerability is clear with sixteen major retailers and their customers affected by hacks since January 2017, along with election and voting-related tampering. Security conscious cryptocurrency holders shy away from centralized exchanges due to this same risk.In his paper, “Dictatorships, Democracy, and Blockchain,” Harmon explains that when data is held in a centralized location, cybercrime risks are higher. With a singular strike to central servers, hackers can cause massive damage. Additionally, Harmon points out that control and ownership of data are concentrated in the hands of a few with centralized systems, which can make it easy for abuse and manipulation of data to occur.According to Harmon, distributed ledgers like hashgraph and blockchain mitigate these risks as“[t]here is no single server to attack, nor is there a single organization or individual that can unilaterally take actions on behalf of the community.”With multiple nodes verifying transactions and storing data, tampering becomes much more complex. Altering data on one node wouldn’t impact the network; rather, every node would have to be altered individually. Additionally, a single hack doesn’t affect every node, which prevents another major problem: network shutdowns.As Baird told Nunn,“…it's great to have a wonderful network, but if somebody could easily shut down the whole network for hours, that's not so good.”The hashgraph algorithm allows for a higher level of network resiliency than both traditional centralized data storage and blockchain.The mechanism behind hashgraph’s resiliency is Byzantine fault tolerance, the holy grail of security in the world of DLT. As Harmon told Nunn, Byzantine fault tolerance is a 30 year old concept in the academic field, but“[w]hat's new is the ability to achieve it at scale,”which is what Baird accomplished.According to Blockonomi,“[I]n a distributed system, Byzantine Fault Tolerance refers to the ability of the system to retain honest consensus in the network despite malicious nodes failing or propagating false messages.”Harmon explained to Nunn that“the asynchronous part is the important part,”the key to why“in terms of security, hashgraph's algorithm achieves the gold standard in the field of distributed consensus.”The asynchronous factor, according to Baird, refers to all nodes being the same; that is, an absence of a leader that could be targeted by attackers.In Baird’s words, asynchronous byzantine fault tolerance is“the math term that says, we're actually more resilient to being shut down than other people.”To Baird, this resilience is crucial, especially in applications involving financial transactions, where a couple of hours of downtime would wreak havoc.When it comes to security, Baird’s policy and consequently Hedera’s, is “we can do it, so why not do it?” This means extra layers of security are added in even if existing security measures are technically adequate.While the Hedera team acknowledges that there is no foolproof security solution, they’ve taken extensive measures to make hashgraph as secure as possible. In fact, Baird goes so far as to call their security measures “overkill,” explaining that Hedera is,“at every level, consistent with the CNSA standard for security that the U.S. Government uses to protect its own top-secret information.”It also employs“TLS encryption of our communication between nodes”which Baird says is unnecessary given that event signatures are already being checked. Additionally, Baird explained,“we've flipped the switch to turn on ephemeral keys, so we have perfect secrecy.”In addition to its security model, Hedera developer advocate, Simi Hunjan, told Nunn that transaction speed is another feature that sets Hedera apart from other DLTs. For example, blockchain technology hasn’t solved the scalability issue. Reaching consensus on Bitcoin transactions, for instance, can take over an hour, which leaves much to be desired in a retail atmosphere. In other use cases, such as gaming, thousands of transactions need to happen every second, and blockchain can’t get it done.Hashgraph, which uses a gossip protocol as opposed to Proof-of-Work, can achieve speeds the Bitcoin network can only dream about. Hedera’s website claims that Baird’s virtual voting algorithm“provides near-perfect efficiency in bandwidth usage, handling hundreds of thousands of transactions per second and verifying over one million signatures per second.”Compare that to the Bitcoin network’s three transactions per second, Ethereum’s 20 per second, Ripple’s 1,500, and Visa’s 3,600 per second, and the potential for radical change is clear.Hashgraph also enables micropayments, which is something blockchain hasn’t achieved. Micropayments are just what they sound like: the exchange of tiny amounts of currency, such as a tenth of a cent, five cents, or twenty-five cents—amounts that currently cost more in fees to send than their actual worth.Harmon told Nunn that,“as a technology, we view micropayments, the ability to have really inexpensive, real-time ad hoc relationship micropayments as a killer application.”Harmon explains that currently, merchants selling products and services through APIs lose significant funds to credit card fees, in addition to dealing with restricted cash flow. Micropayments would allow for instant and fee-free transactions, which could radically change the way business is done. For instance, Hunjan referenced online ticket vendors, stating that customers are“probably paying a $40 or $50 surcharge on top of that, fees to actually buy that ticket.”She explained that micropayments could be used as a means of reducing the surcharge.Based on interviews with the Hedera team, micropayments could be the first and greatest impact of hashgraph on the way value is exchanged. For instance, rather than paying flat rates for cable TV service or monthly subscriptions, a built in mechanism to charge and collect small payments per use of a service or, say, TV channel could come into play.Hedera has already figured out how to build micropayments into browser extensions. Baird explained,“we put little tags in the [web]page and the Chrome extension can see those tags and can deal with it. So it's smooth and low-friction for the user and for the developer.”Similarly, micropayments can be built into online games in such a way that little to no effort is needed on the part of the customer or provider. In theory, it could mean an easier and more economical payment system. If transaction fees are taken out of the equation, both customers and providers save money. If those transactions are automated in such a way that neither customer nor provider has to offer effort to spend or collect, time and thus money are saved as well.For such a system to work, it must be streamlined and secure. With the asynchronous byzantine fault tolerance in place, the challenge that remains is to make it “friction-less” for users. That is, to require minimal effort and hassle to send and receive the payments within the game or app or website, while ensuring privacy. To this point, Baird told Nunn that the Hedera team is“doing everything we can to make it extremely easy for the developer to make it invisible for the user, or almost invisible to the user.”Oliver Bolton, founder and CEO of Almond, sees Hedera’s hashgraph as a means to reform the economic structure that has led to widespread environmental destruction and the deterioration of individual and societal health. Bolton has spent two years creating a dapp for Hedera that incentivizes purchasing products that have been produced sustainably and responsibly.With a vision of being “the fastest, most widely distributed, most secure, enterprise-grade public ledger in the world,” the team at Hedera has a lot on its plate.  The company also has done a lot to position itself for success, perhaps most notably in regard to making it accessible to developers. Consider Microsoft, which created a developer community and provided a lot of great (and free) tools for developers to be able to implement Microsoft solutions.Similarly, Hedera is encouraging developer participation. While Hedera is not open source like many blockchain projects, it is open review. In the interview, Harmon explained the distinction and the company’s reasons for opting out of an open source approach:“It's not like developers have to come to us and talk to us to be able to build on the platform and get a license or anything like that. No, it's just use the platform, no license required. You don't have to talk to us at all. We won't even know that you're using the platform as a developer unless you decide to share with us the fact that you are. So in those two ways, it's very similar to everybody else in the market. However, because it's patented, we can make a commitment to the market that it's not going to fork. It's not open license, it's open review…”Chief Developer Advocate for Hedera, Ken Anderson, likens Hedera’s approach to creating a developer community to that of IBM’s blockchain. Anderson, an entrepreneur and software architecture veteran, told Nunn that,“we're actually in the process of building a lot of the same type of tooling, and the same type of documentation, that community support, and creating those strategic relationships that, you know, IBM and the hyper-ledger fabric community have built.”While it may only be a matter of time before the next advance in DLT, hashgraph is moving the field forward. The impact of micropayments and a public distributed ledger on the way our society and economy works are currently unknown, but it doesn’t take much imagination to envision many ways that a trustless distributed ledger with speed and security features could transform various industries. Exactly how that distributed ledger will work…well, we’ll leave that to the Baird’s and Harmon’s of the world."

Respondents were asked to identify the top five systemic risks they saw to the broader economy.Blockchain was first used by bitcoin in 2009 to move value around the world without the need of banks. While the cryptocurrency industry is currently struggling, losing 80% of its value over the past year, blockchain continues to be explored by JP Morgan, Northern Trust and a number of other financial enterprises.This year's list of systemic risks was topped by cyber risk, with 69% of respondents selecting it as a concern; geopolitical risks and trade tensions, cited by 55% of respondents; Britain’s exit from the European Union (Brexit), cited by 49% of respondents; and excessive global debt and the impact of new regulations, cited by 28% of respondents.Even as Scharf warned about the potential negative impact of blockchain, which by its very nature is designed to let users move value without central authorities like the DTCC, the clearing giant is in the final stages of its own blockchain project. Next year, the DTCC is expected to replatform its $11 trillion Trade Information Warehouse (TIW) using the permissioned Axcore blockchain, inspired by the ethereum blockchain.The DTCC’s complicated relationship with blockchain reflects the financial industry’s interest and concerns on a larger scale, according to Sharf. To further demonstrate the point, Kenneth Rogoff, a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, yesterday warned that investing in cryptocurrency was like buying ""lottery tickets that pay off in a dystopian future where they are used in rogue and failed states.""For his part, Scharf added: “The increase in concern around fintech’s impact on systemic risk demonstrates a growing awareness of the potential risk and highlights the need to evaluate both risks and rewards associated with fintech initiatives."""

In 2008, I was asked to write a column on the topic, and since millions of us were still reeling from losing everything, the title I suggested was, On Monday I was Ready to Retire, Now It’s Tuesday.Catchy, yes, but when people woke up to find $10.2 trillion in wealth had been wiped out from the American economy, they wanted answers. More importantly, they wanted to take back some semblance of control over their financial lives and find a way to protect themselves from “next time,” which had quickly become their new worst fear.In particular, folks nearing retirement age—with less time to earn and recover—were asking where they could invest their money so it wouldn’t disappear again in a few years. And honestly you’d think that by now, after having had 47 recessions in our country (yes, that’s the real number), that Wall Street would be capable of answering that question.

Not only do we spend too much money on frivolous, instant-gratification purchases that prevent us from saving for retirement, but apparently we also have no idea how to play the market.Even though “buy low, sell high” should be programmed into all our psyches by now, many investors seem to do the exact opposite. The average investor has earned total returns of just 2.5% over the past 20 years, while the S&P 500 has returned an average of 9.5%. If that’s not enough evidence, just look at how many people jumped on the cryptocurrency band wagon last year, only to see 90% of their profits and principal wiped out 12 months later. Just last week,  the market cap of the entire cryptocurrency market plummeted by $15 billion in just 24 hours, and bitcoin hit its lowest level of the year, according to CoinDesk. Needless to say, these days no one is asking me about investing in bitcoin. (Finally, progress.)Don’t get me wrong, we all make financial mistakes. I’ve made plenty in my day, and I’m a firm believer that it’s one of the best ways we learn. As we age, our financial decision-making capabilities tend to evolve along with our priorities. We begin to realize that we’re investing for our life, not for some arbitrary Wall Street target, like beating the S&P 500. Honestly, who cares? Do you really want to sit around bragging about your market prowess while the rest of your friends are out enjoying their golden years?No matter how old and wise we become, the reality is that we’re never able to control the markets or the economy. Thankfully, though, we can exert control over our emotions, which I’d argue have much more to do with our returns than the markets themselves. (Folks who got scared and pulled out in 2008, I’m talking to you.)To keep my clients sane and their money protected before, during and after a recession, I sit down with them for something I like to call the “income generation conversation.” We touch on a lot of different topics, but one of the most important is the emergency fund. You’ve likely heard many times that it’s good to have between three and six months’ worth of living expenses set aside in the event of a job loss, health crisis, or other unforeseen circumstance.  What you likely haven’t heard is that those numbers only make sense when you’re actively employed. Once you’re retired, you need to have a full five years’ worth of living expenses in cash, or at least out of the market.Before you start complaining about how much money that is, stop and think about what it would feel like to have to draw down on your accounts while the market is at a low point. Chipping away at your savings before they’ve had a chance to recover means a double whammy for your wallet.Perhaps you did the math and know that you have enough saved to last until you’re 100. Good for you. But what happens if you’re forced to take withdrawals after the market loses another $6.9 trillion in shareholder wealth, like it did in 2008?Once you’re retired, you can't afford to wait for the markets to recover in order to enjoy your golden years. Those grandkids are only going to be young for so long. Which is why the most important thing you can do is to set your retirement accounts up so that you can weather any storm. Here’s a rundown on five separate portfolios I would recommend setting aside to ensure just that.Whether you follow the above religiously or come up with a variation on your own plan, remember that your life cannot be put on hold if the market tanks. While it’s true that these portfolios may not be wholly “recession-proof,” they are largely “emotion-proof.”  Anytime your strategy involves removing the temptation to have a fire sale with your assets, or draw down on your accounts during a downturn, it is a very good strategy indeed.Stay up to date on the investing world with Forbes Investing Digest, a free eletter of Forbes’ top investing articles, delivered each week to your inbox.---John E.

by code, but does replicable code have value? (Full disclosure: I own ...","Dec 4, 2018,09:00am EST","Most people understand the idea that money doesn't have to be physical. Way back in 1933, the United States left the gold standard for domestic transactions. In 1971, the U.S. ended the Bretton Woods System, which stipulated the international convertibility of the U.S. dollar into gold. Digital tokens and cryptocurrency have stepped beyond the leap of faith users have in a government. Billions of dollars have flowed into Bitcoin and ICOs that are only backed by code, but does replicable code have value? (Full disclosure: I own and have mined some Bitcoin and Ethereum.)","People in the blockchain industry -- myself included -- are often asked about the true value of tokens. It’s commonly positioned as, “Without a physical asset or a government, does it have any value?” Questions about legitimacy and true value have been contributing factors in the plummeting price of cryptocurrencies and tokens. What does it mean to own something “rare,” and is rare enough when it’s just software? As markets have fallen dramatically since Q1, investors are left scratching their heads about what they really bought.But something interesting is happening in the space to address some of the core questions about innate value and legitimacy. The blockchain industry is coupling the best of the old world with the best of the new world, bridging the gap between practical investment and blockchain-based assets. These new asset types are called stablecoins.What is a stablecoin?Stablecoins are tokens on a blockchain with one key difference: They are tied to a physical asset. That asset might be gold or cash or even real estate; regardless of what it is, they create a physical tether to the real world. This theoretically creates a level of both transparency and true rarity in ownership. By tethering the token to something physical, the question “Can’t you just digitally create more tokens?” goes away.There were a number of early ventures in this space circa 2014, but the first one that managed to gain significant traction was originally called Realcoin established by Brock Pierce. This was eventually rebranded as Tether, which is still around today, and the concept is simple: Keep fiat funds in a bank that are equal to the number of Tether.In theory, this concept creates a stable and closed loop. However, Tether was plagued by questions on transparency, along with a 2017 system breach where a hacker made off with more than $30 million worth of Tether (USDT).Despite those problems, Tether gave the blockchain industry a strong proof of concept, and since then, stablecoins have essentially split into two different directions:• Smart contracts that govern the tokenized trade of physical assets (oil, real estate, etc.).• Government-regulated tokens that offer 1:1 equivalent of currency -- like Tether but approved by a regulator and verified by a third-party auditor.What does the present -- and future -- of stablecoins look like?Like many elements of the blockchain and cryptocurrencies, the stablecoin industry is a bit of a wild digital west out there. One of the biggest steps forward is the Petro, a token from the country of Venezuela. Originally met with skepticism (President Trump even banned U.S. citizens from purchasing it), the token breaks new ground as it is issued by a sovereign government and is backed by oil. The political action of banning may stem from the U.S. dollar being the primary settlement means for trading oil globally.However, blockchains by their very nature are a self-clearing and settling software. This creates an interesting opportunity for blockchain -- a trustless system -- to enable trade with a partner that is not trusted, like Venezuela.The other interesting development is the most recent approval by the financial regulators for the issuance of 1:1 U.S. dollar-denominated currency tokens that are subject to a pass-through FDIC insurance. Gemini and itBit, both New York State regulated trust companies, launched new stable tokens. Their 1:1 U.S. dollar-denominated token are regulated under the supervision of the New York Department of Financial Institutions and audited by a third party.With withering trust in Tether, this is a welcome reprieve for crypto traders and other users who would like to utilize the stability of U.S. dollars and the fluidity of a token. Other significant players, such as Circle Financial, an established crypto exchange, have also announced the development and issuance of a dollar-denominated stablecoin.The Gemini dollar and the Paxos Standard are not the only stablecoins striving to become fully regulatory compliant. Shamir Karkal, the co-founder of Simple, the first all-digital bank, recently launched Sila. It is a platform for developers that issues stablecoins on the Ethereum blockchain. Sila has the potential to further disrupt finance and banking as it combines the best of the old world, stability, with the best of the new world, transparency and ease of use.What can stablecoins do?When Ethereum gained prominence, it opened the door to ICOs. As those gained popularity, it became clear that they were fast, efficient but also unstable -- a high-risk/high-reward investing game. This new wave of stablecoins represents a notable shift in the market, a path to greater longevity tied to real-world assets.The greater the stability, the more conservative investors will dip into cryptocurrencies. That may be the greatest trick behind stablecoins, and in another decade, we may look back on stablecoins as one of the catalysts to mainstream acceptance.The information provided here is not investment or financial advice.

The US Dollar marketplace presently suffers from a torrent of negative influences. This includes:All of this leads to negative pressures on any investment tied to the US Dollar. As evidenced by the NASDAQ, it went from $8,100 on August 31 to $6,983 on Black Friday November 23. Also, Bitcoin went from $6,900 to $4,300 over the same time span.Investors do not always make rational decisions. The technology behind cryptocurrency is unlike anything else today. Some short-term investors are seeking fiat-based gains on cryptocurrency investments given the previous substantial increases. These investors are measuring the success or failure of their investment using the fiat nomenclature as everything else in their life is likely measured by the same.Cryptocurrency is automated money. Until the invention of this technology, it was not possible to adequately measure and execute actions based on an event without using complex computing systems. By some measures, large systems such as Oracle, SAP or Net Suite has achieved success working around the problems of money within the system. The money was never truly automated, so all the other portions of the systems are designed as workarounds to this fact. This leads to semi-automated actions wherein humans must perform tasks involving money or money actions so that the overall system works.Cryptocurrencies with built-in intelligence, such as Ethereum and EOS and others, can track and execute actions automatically without the need for human intervention. This means that money can now become a variable in a larger mathematical equation. This frictionless environment is a paradigm change over the fiat-based systems.Systems developers can now create entire automated process flows with a large degree of control over the variables in which the application operates. This removes the need for many classes of workers that systems like SAP, Oracle and Net Suite requires. This also gives rise to the opportunity for new classes of workers to create solutions without the incessant fear over unautomated money. Much in the same way that most people view dumb phones, the modern entrepreneur remains unconcerned over the fiat pair of cryptocurrencies.Based on this, I view 2019 and beyond as years of growth opportunities for cryptocurrency driven solutions. I also view the next few years as problematic for any fiat-based currency. "

[+] Photo credit: ASSOCIATED PRESS,"Muni bond defaults are rare.To the tune of less than one-tenth of one percent.But you’re probably careful when you walk under scaffolding even though the risk of a construction worker falling on top of your head is slight too.There are a number of things you and the Securities and Exchange Commission and muni bond issuers can do to protect yourself against the possibility of losing significant amounts of money on the municipal bonds you buy and hold.The safeguards you can take, and dangers surfaced at an SEC roundtable on muni bond disclosures Thursday.Municipal bond prospectuses can be too lengthy, ponderous and yes, boring, to read in full.Like with any lengthy financial document, such as an SEC filing, there are nuggets you can find quickly by doing key word searches.SEC Commissioner Robert Jackson suggested looking up “repayment,” which will tell you where the city, state or other local government is getting to repay the money you are lending it through a muni bond purchase and “unfunded liabilities,”---other demands on the governmental unit on the pot of money it is using to pay bondholders.The biggest danger a retail investor who owns munis can avoid is to sell them immediately when bad news comes out because things inevitably get better, advised Jim Spiotto, managing partner of Chapman Strategic Partners.One of the reasons problems with a muni bond issuer quickly improve, said Spiotto, is just as doctors bury their mistakes, finance officers finance theirs.Spiotto’s firm is an outgrowth of Chapman and Cutler one of the top law firms in the municipal bond arena for over half of a century.Speaking to the potential for a wave of new muni bonds hitting the market if Congress passes a major infrastructure bill, Spiotto acknowledged when anyone (including local governments) does anything fast, it is important short cuts aren’t taken.“When muni bond issuers make multiple issues in a short period of time, they will have to make sure tax revenues to support the bonds are sustainable and affordable,” the consultant said.At the same time, Spiotto said infrastructure improvements could ease the financial stress on muni bond issuers because they stimulate local economies.The expert said if a muni bond issuer tells one investor about changes in their financial condition to tell all.“Disclosure allows all to understand the situation including those who would constructively help if they knew the accurate situation,” said Spiotto.He added issuers who expand disclosures can be better market credibility and better credit ratings.When it comes to developments have put an issuer under financial distress, Spiotto said investor panic can be reduced or eliminated by full and prompt disclosure of the evolving situation.Retail investors need better and faster information from muni bond government creators to help make better buy and hold decisions, SEC Chair Jay Clayton told the gathering.“Without it, it is challenging to evaluate the condition of issuers,” said Clayton.He complained some issuers don’t release their financial statements until significantly after the end of their fiscal years.He noted mom and pop investors hold about $2.66 trillion in muni bonds directly or indirectly, two-thirds of the entire value of the market.With the heavy reliance of retail investors on muni bonds and of society as a whole since they account for two-thirds of the infrastructure in the country, Clayton said there should be a close regulatory focus on the municipal bond market.He said the SEC and the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board are studying ideas to improve the speed and completeness of muni bond disclosures.Timeliness needs to be improved, asserted SEC Investor Advocate Rick Fleming.“Financials are stale by the time they are disclosed, that has been an investor issue for a long time,” said Fleming.Democratic SEC Commissioner Kara Stein added her voice to the calls for better information for muni bond issuers to investors: “More work needs to be done on disclosures.”She added there are no shortage of issues that need to be looked at for their potential impact on muni bonds including public pension shortages and interest rate changes.Republican Hester Peirce said she is all in favor of clear English in muni bond disclosures because while retail investors might not read them, third parties that distill the highlights and feed them to individual investors do.She explained the disclosures can be important in muni bond pricing.In terms of what information the SEC should mandate from the issuers, Peirce said: “I don’t want to give people a sense there is a lower bar for materiality than there is.”Fidelity Research Analyst Amy Johonnett protested disclosure is inconsistent everywhere in municipal securities.With the calls for more disclosures, there are worries they could further strain the budgets of already financially strapped local governments, said SEC Office of Municipal Securities Attorney-Advisor Adam Windell.During the session, S&P Global Ratings Managing Director Robin Prunty called the 2019 economic forecast for state and local governments “troubling.”“There will be a much more strained budget climate,” she said.She added, though, economists are not predicting a recession and many state and local governments are in good financial shape. "

There was a time when consumers were the main target. These days, however, ransomware distributors have no problem going after much larger targets.","Image: Ohio Valley Medical CenterAttacks targeting health care providers have become an increasingly regular occurrence. Over the weekend, the East Ohio Regional Hospital in Harper's Ferry, Ohio and the Ohio Valley Medical Center in Wheeling, West Virginia both fell victim to ransomware.As IT staff dealt with the outbreak, emergency room admissions had to be limited to walk-up patients only. Ambulances were diverted to other nearby hospitals. A number of systems were taken offline and hospital staff switched immediately to paper charting out of an abundance of caution.Thanks to the quick response and multi-layered defenses the impact of the ransomware was fairly limited. Director of marketing Karin Janiszewski told The Times Leader “we have redundant security, so the attack was able to get through the first layer but not the second layer.""So far, this sounds like the situation has been handled about as well as it could have been. No patient data was compromised as a result of the attack and there's been no indication that a ransom was paid. As a reminder, law enforcement officials say that you should never pay a ransomware ransom.That hasn't necessarily been the case with other health care providers hit by ransomware. In 2016, Hollywood Prebyterian paid hackers around $17,000 in Bitcoin after suffering a widespread infection. Earlier this year, Hancock Regional Hospital in Greenfield, Indiana shelled out Bitcoin worth approximately $55,000 to restore encrypted files.A third incident underscores why it's a bad idea to fork over a ransom payment. When Kansas Heart Hospital paid cybercriminals in 2016, its attackers didn't follow through on the promise to decrypt files. Instead, they sent along a second ransom demand -- for a lot more money than the initial one."

[+] Credit: Getty Images),"It wouldn't take long to get familiar with the so-called ""pump and dump"" scheme in the crypto space in China –– that is, to pump up the price of crypto tokens in order to attract retail investors and after they ramped up the price, to sell the tokens and leave. In most cases, such crypto projects or the investors behind them would take their money and leave quietly; but one investor, who was allegedly accused of doing so, decided not to be low-key about it at all.On Nov. 7, Yang Ning, a well-known angel investor, wrote a post on his WeChat, a popular social media platform in China, declaring his departure from the Chinese crypto sector.""It feels great to leave the crypto world that's full of liars and gamblers. I was going to leave quietly but had to go against the whole crypto sector. I have deleted all the group chats and people [on WeChat]. If you are still in the crypto world and are able to read this post, it only means you are not 'well-known' enough. I have already lost my trust in the concept of the decentralized blockchain. Blockchain can only grow under the centralized structure of laws and regulations. [This is] the last time I commented on this decision.""The post has received widespread backlash centered upon, surprisingly, Yang and his very own project: Commerce Data Connection (CDC).Born in early January this year, CDC claimed itself to be the first blockchain-based decentralized global consumer sharing network. Not long after the launch, a total number of 10 million CDC tokens were issued and were listed on Huobi, the third-largest crypto exchange by trading volumes, in May.Yet the party was also over too soon –- about six months later on Nov. 5, Huobi Global published a community post, announcing that CDC tokens were suspended from all trading and deposit services on Huobi, after the crypto exchange found that the project team ""have violated the rules of Huobi Global whereby the total locked amount of tokens of the project team was inconsistent with what was promised in the white paper.""During several interviews with China-based blockchain news sites such as 8btc, Yang admitted that he also has lost $2 million with his CDC project and about 20% of the tokens are being controlled by ""bad actors.""At press time, the official website of CDC has removed all information except one statement as following:“Due to discovery of some community members who have been maliciously manipulating the token price, [the team] has decided to dilute the value of tokens held by these bad actors. This move will lower the cost to hold tokens by the community and stimulate the market to grow healthier”Meanwhile, this long-time angel investor failed to answer many other key questions around CDC, for example, who the “bad actors” are. After his very high-profile declaration to quit crypto on WeChat, many, including investors of CDC, are still waiting for him to answer these questions.According to a chat history of a WeChat group message that still had Yang listed as a group member on Nov. 7, several other group members sent the same messages to Yang, initiated by one WeChat user named Dovey Wan.""Mr Yang, [will you consider] publishing the financial documents of the project [CDC]? Won't you explain the fact that the team locked the tokens and then pumped them? To be honest, since tokens and codes are returned to the community in order to leave the project to develop independently, does that also mean the money should be returned to the community as well?""Yang did not respond.One person, who previously invested in Yang's CDC project and declined to be identified in the story, said that the project had failed to fulfill its goals that were listed on its original white paper since the beginning.""The market at the time [earlier 2018] was more of a 'help-yourself' situation,"" the person said, explaining his own failure to recognize the problems around Yang's project during an early stage. ""As long as [the project] got a story to tell and the story looked plausible, it could make a profit. That was how [crazy] the market was at the time.""From a renowned investor to an alleged scammer, Yang's case raised one question: should traditional venture capitalists like Yang jump into the crypto world… at all?While Yang's case may potentially put a question mark for many investors with similar backgrounds, Emma Liao, another early investor of the internet industry, could, however, offer a much brighter path for the hesitated upcoming investors.Similar to Yang, Liao also isn't someone that can be described as ""low-key.""When this 32-year-old investor introduced herself, she began her sentence with the fact that her great-grandfather was Liao Yaoxiang, a high-ranking Kuomintang general who successfully fought against the imperial Japanese army during the Second Sino-Japanese War.In China, when you come from a ""red"" family – a family that's associated with the communist party – the association often opens more doors to you.Though Liao said she didn't think her family background put her at an advantage, from cross-border mergers and acquisitions to the founding of China's first professional ice hockey club team, Liao's past decades of experience across several sectors look impressive.The almost perfect-looking resume has not stopped her from dreaming even bigger.As she entered the crypto landscape, Liao came in with one ambitious goal: to take the blockchain technology mainstream.This dream, ultimately, is what separates people like her from Yang, especially during a bearish market, according to an interview with Liao.Liao, who said she knows Yang personally, refused to comment on his case specifically. But she agreed to speak at a much broader level where she found incidents like Yang’s case very upsetting.""I would say the mistake they have is that they underestimated the wildness of the crypto world,"" Liao said. ""[…] you were tricked because you were getting into a battle, a wild battle that you were not used to – that's not anybody else's fault.""According to Liao, before she picked up Ultrain, the project that she co-founded with several former employees from Alibaba, she had spent tons of time and money learning about the blockchain and the cryptocurrency.And the hard work is paying off.Ultrain, a project that hopes to provide public infrastructure for the future of decentralized business on the blockchain, also presents an almost perfect resume like Liao herself: it has gathered some of the top talents in the crypto field in China, including core cryptographers and technicians from Alibaba and Ant Financial, an affiliate of Alibaba. With the support of the strong technology team, it has made innovations and optimizations across several areas such as consensus, smart contracts, and development frameworks.With that being said, by far, Ultrain was able to raise $20 million from some of the most notable venture capitalists and token funds in China including Morningside Venture Capital, BlueRun Ventures, Draper Dragon, Aplus Capital, DHVC, FBG Capital, NEO Global Capital, and Ceyuan Ventures.Beyond the successful round of funding and a recent product launch in October, Liao said that what truly makes Ultrain outstanding is the team behind it, a group of people who hold a firm belief of a future that is built on the blockchain.“They [core members at Ultrain] were offered stock options at Alibaba along with high salaries.,” Liao said. “They jumped out of Alibaba, the comfortable platform, and joined us [only] because we want to make the [blockchain] technology work and to actually build a business ecosystem.”“We are not in for short-term money,” she added.Indeed, as Liao's answer implies, in an industry that's still considered as nascent yet fast-growing, the reasons that have brought the people here matter deeply. For anyone who is here to chase after ""a fad"" or a quick profit,  their projects may have been doomed to fail from the beginning.Of course, during a time when bitcoin, the No.1 cryptocurrency, plunged as much as 78% from its record high of around $20,000 last December, only time can really tell who the final winners are or if there is a winner at all.But for now, the comparison of Liao and her Ultrain with Yang and his CDC may have revealed one good thing about a bearish-looking market that many may have missed: it also has become a real test for the crypto projects that rushed out during the bull market earlier this year. And only the really good ones may survive the cold winter."

The total market cap of the FAANG technology companies—Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google—is down $1 trillion dollars from yearly highs.In the crypto market the unrelenting market downtrend, which has seen $60 billion dollars erased in just the past week, is threatening to force firms to close their doors in the face of deeply negative YTD returns and the risk of losing new capital commitments.Of course, there is one asset class that is still doing well amidst such brutal market conditions: stablecoins. According to Coindesk, USDC, TUSD and DAI each saw their 24-hour trading volume increase by over 200% during the market sell-off on November 19. EURS 24-hour trading volume increased by a whopping 863.9% that same day, according to data from CoinMarketCap.This is not surprising. When the markets face sharp drops, people need a quick way to reduce their exposure. Exchanging their cryptocurrency for fiat currency is slow and relatively expensive, so instead they exchange traditional crypto such as Bitcoin and Ethereum for safe on-chain assets like EURS or TUSD.Furthermore, the broad lack of confidence in USDT, the leading stablecoin by market cap and trading volume, is causing this influx of capital to be more widely distributed among a number of challengers."

It's expected to disrupt the industry as much as when Expedia, Airbnb, and Priceline took vacation planning online. German company TUI Group, the world’s largest tourism company, is also the world’s pioneer to integrate blockchain into the travel industry. In fact, the company’s chief executive, Friedrich Joussen, has such belief in the technology and its probability of replacing the services of companies such as Expedia, that TUI Group sold Hotelbeds in 2016 for $1.6 billion to get the company out of the travel aggregator business.","Adobe StockTUI Group With 1,600 travel agencies, six airlines, more than 380 hotels, 16 cruise liners, and other tourism-related ventures, TUI Group is an international tourism group that serves approximately 20 million customers. It currently houses all of its contracts on a private blockchain; however, company leaders believe their blockchain platform could be made public so that agents and customers could access it to book travel. Joussen said, “If you want to address 20 million customers individually, you need the most modern IT technology. So, the blockchain is not the internet, the blockchain is the next internet.”How blockchain can manage travel inventoryBlockchain is an open, distributed database that is highly secure and is the underlying technology behind cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. Basically, it's a computer file used for storing data that is duplicated entirely across many computers. Not one person or company controls the file. The data in the blockchain is encoded, and the only way to edit it is if you have the ""key"" to the block of chain you wish to edit or read. Historic data on the chain cannot be lost or corrupted. In addition to its uses in the financial world, blockchains are used whenever transactions need to be recorded securely such as in supply chains, shipping details, for government records, ownership rights, patient files, charitable contributions and more.
While TUI Group manages its internal smart contracts that can execute automatically with blockchain they eventually see how blockchain could be the foundation for a system that maintains real-time records as needed in the travel industry. For example, hotels that have extra inventory to sell could update the blockchain with that inventory and everyone could see the price and engage directly with the hotelier. Joussen was quoted in the Skift newspaper, as saying, ""It's cheaper, has a higher performance, and is accessible from everywhere – it's a pure cost equation.""The company’s BedSwap project uses a blockchain-enabled system to maintain records of hotel bed inventories in real-time. That bed inventory can then be offered across markets within seconds, and there is no need for an intermediary such as Expedia to manage the information. If this technology is rolled out to the industry, and anyone can view real-time availability of rooms or flights, Joussen predicts there will be millions in savings over the next several years.While TUI has been busy building its own internal system to manage its bed inventory and toying with the idea of making it public, Winding Tree is another company working to develop a public decentralized travel ecosystem to distribute travel inventory. The two companies have had conversations, but Winding Tree believes its public version is more secure and its goal is to make a solution for the entire industry. If they succeed, anyone would be able to secure rooms on the blockchain without the intermediaries setting the rates. In this reality, it would be up to hotels and airlines to set commissions (how high or if any) rather than a third-party setting them.Benefits of blockchain in the travel industryAs blockchain gets tested and trialed, there will be advantages to the travel industry. Here are just a few of them:•           A decentralized marketplace equals a democratized market.•           A blockchain system is controlled by all involved and cannot be manipulated.•           Cost savings and increased efficiencies will be realized since intermediaries are no longer part of the process.•           Blockchain provides an immutable and secure payment and data transfer platform.•           The cost to set up a blockchain system is minor compared to setting up and maintaining a system such as Expedia.•           Blockchain could enable an easy-to-implement loyalty rewards program.Will you be transacting on the blockchain the next time you travel? Only time will tell. It’s certainly an intriguing possibility."

It’s also an appropriate name for the first seeing as it’s the same word to name the first block in a blockchain.The team behind it are also launching their subscription box service, but shipping later in December. With this subscribers will receive a unique, crypto-themed figure each month. To ensure they aren’t mass producing toys, the subscription boxes will be limited to a set amount of pieces a month.CryptoKaijuThe team behind Kaiju, taking reference from the Japanese film genre, are hoping that they can tap into a growing market of enthusiasts who want to be able to verify their collectibles. With the toy market lacking provenance and verifiable authenticity, the team are exploring opportunities to work with artists who are interested in seeing how the technology can be used in the scarcity and provenance of collectibles.As a longtime collector of designer toys such as Kaws, Futura Pointmen and Medicom Bearbricks, I’ve previously had issues with not having full confidence that what I was buying was genuine, as well as issues with knowing exactly how many items have been produced in each batch, said Oliver Carding, co-founder of CryptoKaiju. The concept of bringing not just provenance, but also a personality, through a set of attributes to a physical toy is extremely intriguing.Carding, who is also the founder of Manchester-based blockchain news site CoinJournal, established in 2014, has teamed up with David Moore, James Morgan and Andy Gray, the three co-founders of KnownOrigin, a Manchester-based digital art marketplace. Connecting with the KnownOrigin team at a blockchain meetup, Carding wanted to explore linking NFTs to physical collectibles.""At the beginning of the summer we began to explore how we could use the technology for vinyl toys,"" Carding added. ""We sat down and discussed all the challenges that come with linking a physical item to a smart contract such as ensuring that the item represented physically is the one referenced in the smart contract.""Each toy will have a tamper-proof resistant near-field communication (NFC) tag in its foot, enabling owners to use their smartphones or other devices to communicate with the chip. Using the same token standard as the popular virtual CryptoKitties, the team mint an ""ERC721 compliant non-fungible token, or in simpler terms, a crypto-collectible,"" said Gray. ""Once on the blockchain, the Kaiju has a unique identity and trackable provenance.""CryptoKaijuRepresented as a token that sits within a smart contract, each toy contains unique metadata describing it. This includes its birth date, gender, color, a description and two personality traits such as ""intelligence"" or ""creativity."" According to the team, certain traits and colors will be scarcer than others, resulting in varying demand for the toys, in addition to the excitement of the unknown.Carding, who first became interested in cryptocurrencies and blockchains around five years ago, said that vinyl toy collectors are embracing when the team are doing.The idea of having a toy where you can prove scarcity, one with unique digital traits is really appealing to them, he added. Ethereum and NFT fans love the idea of having a physical NFT as well as a cool collectible for their desk.Interest has also been seen from game developers using Ethereum who want to integrate the NFT into their products, in addition to distributors and independent toy and art store owners who want to buy the toys. Talks are also being had with investors in the space.This is the first step for CryptoKaiju, but their aim is to develop a decentralised platform that ""allows for the creation and trading of physical items backed by tokens and improves how provenance is handled for physical art and collectibles,"" said Carding.Individual toys are priced at $55 while subscription boxes are available on a six-month subscription at $320 and a 12-month subscription at $600. Perks for subscribers include quicker shipping, beta access to new features, priority access to special offers, collaborations, new projects and free merchandise."
