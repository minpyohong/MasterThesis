dropped by 80 percent from January to September 2018. 17481 Total ...","Nov 20, 2018","Bitcoin (BTC) use for commercial payments has reduced significantly this year, according to a study by Chainalysis cited by Reuters Nov. 20.","To prepare the study, Chainalysis reportedly surveyed 17 Bitcoin payment processors. The amount of BTC handled by major payment processors reportedly dropped by almost 80 percent from the beginning of the year to September.The analysis of individual payment processors’ figures reportedly shows a downward trend. At Canadian firm Coinpayments, the value of transactions has fallen by more than half between January and October 2018, Reuters reports, citing data from blockchain analysis site OXT. Lex Sokolin, global director of fintech strategy at research firm Autonomous Next, said that “Bitcoin payments processing is seeing a slow but consistent decline.”Comprehensive data on the leading cryptocurrency used for payments is reportedly not consistent since trades with other currencies are commonly included together with its use for commercial payments.Although Chainalysis recognizes a growing stability of BTC, the value of Bitcoin payments reportedly slumped from $427 million last December to $96 million in September 2018.While many believe that BTC’s relative stability this year will result in the mainstream deployment of it as a payment method by both individuals and commercial organizations, some financial firms and crypto entrepreneurs think that stability is not enough.Joni Teves, a strategist at London-based financial firm UBS, told Reuters that BTC needs to become faster and cheaper, also noting that the development of clearer rules on an asset would help give users a sense of legitimacy.Some major companies that previously accepted BTC have turned away from the cryptocurrency as a payment method. Microsoft announced in January that after almost three years it would stop accepting BTC. However, it did reserve that position after taking its own steps to: “ensure lower Bitcoin amounts would be redeemable by customers.”The gaming platform Steam also stopped accepting BTC payments in December 2017, over a year after it began accepting Bitcoin when the currency was trading around $450. Among concerns over volatility and regulatory uncertainty, industry players also cite the issue of growing transaction fees and slow transactions speeds as barriers to wider adoption."

Yesterday, Cointelegraph reported on China’s crypto miners selling out crypto mining hardware by weight, rather than by unit.On Nov. 20, major U.S. crypto mining and blockchain firm Giga Watt filed for bankruptcy, claiming that the company is ""insolvent and unable to pay its debts when due,” holding assets between zero and $50,000."

Kayamori noted:“If there’s enough miners going out of business, that [means] equilibrium is near. When you look at how markets overshoot, both up and down, you can probably say it’s close to the bottom.”Kayamori claimed that Japanese regulators are now starting to open up again to approve new crypto exchanges and token listings following the the theft of $534 million worth of crypto in January from Japanese exchange Coincheck.Moreover, the majority of domestic exchanges are coming close to fulfilling the terms of the business improvement orders that were issued by Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) to clean up the industry in the aftermath of the Coincheck hack.With better practices in place across governance, compliance, asset segregation, secure cold wallet storage — as well as increased participation from financial industry veterans — Japan’s crypto landscape is in a period of “consolidation,” he said.Noting that Japan was the “first global economic powerhouse” to regulate crypto, Kayamori pointed to the country’s pioneering attention to the industry’s latest fundraising model, the successor to Initial Coin Offerings (ICO): Security Token Offerings, or STOs.Additionally, the FSA is reportedly working on ICO regulations to protect investors from fraud. And, as reported today, Japan’s government is also purportedly currently seeking ways to prevent tax evasion on profits from crypto transactions."

It has been adjusted for the second time today since the beginning of a so-called “crypto winter” in mid-November, after which the difficulty in mining Bitcoin has been steadily dropping.The most recent adjustments of Bitcoin’s hashing difficulty. Source: btc.comThe largest drop in Bitcoin’s difficulty history happened on Oct. 31, 2011, with an adjustment of -18 percent, while another decrease (-13 percent) in mid-October 2011 is the third largest such decrease.A recent adjustment of Bitcoin’s hashing difficulty was preceded by a massive market drop, with Bitcoin losing more than a third of its price since Nov. 14, according to CoinMarketCap. Financial experts have attributed the market collapse to regulatory pressure, the hash rate war after controversial Bitcoin Cash hard fork, and the “terrible” condition of global markets.The decrease in difficulty, along with market panic and coin devaluations are forcing the miners to quit. In September, CEO of China-based crypto mining pool F2Pool Shixing Mao revealed data on mining profitability.According to Mao, the break-even point for Bitcoin was between $3,891 and $11,581, depending on the make and model of equipment being used. At the time of the forecast, Bitcoin was trading around $6,400.In late November, a week after the massive drop when Bitcoin hovered around $4,300, Chinese miners reportedly started to sell mining machines by weight, as opposed to price per unit. According to an F2Pool post, miners are especially eager to sell the older models, including the Antminer S7, Antminer T9, and Avalon A741, as they have reached their “shutdown price.”After a mild recovery over the weekend, where Bitcoin managed to stay slightly above $4,000, the world’s top cryptocurrency has collapsed again today, Dec. 3.

where ABC stands for Adjustable Blocksize Cap) is spearheaded by the ...","Nov 26, 2018","It has been more than a week since the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) blockchain was split into two during the fateful hard fork. Two opposing sides clashed over the future of BCH as an asset, and it is time to see where both parties stand, now that the dust has finally started to settle.","As described in an earlier Cointelegraph article, Bitcoin ABC (BCH ABC, where ABC stands for Adjustable Blocksize Cap) is spearheaded by the likes of Roger Ver, renowned BCH advocate, and Jihan Wu, co-founder of Bitmain, an extremely powerful mining outfit. It was founded back in July 2017 as part of the original BCH blockchain, but morphed into an independent entity as the conflict escalated and the split became inevitable.BCH ABC proponents stand for the idea that the basic structure of BCH “does not need any radical change.” Still, Bitcoin ABC’s roadmap suggests further development of the network, mainly via increasing Bitcoin Cash’s blocksize (hence the name) and minimizing transactions costs.On the other side of the corner was Bitcoin SV (Satoshi’s Vision) lead by Craig Wright, who has previously declared himself as Satoshi Nakamoto. Other supporters include niche news outlets like CoinGeek, CalvinAyre and Bitcoin.org. BCH SV was created in August 2018, not long before the hard fork began.The “reformers” attempt to restore “the original Satoshi protocol” by changing the BCH structure. Specifically, the plan involves entirely overwriting the network scripts of Bitcoin ABC and increasing the block size of BCH from 32MB to a maximum of 128MB to elevate network capacity and scale.On Nov. 15, the BCH blockchain was split, and both parties started to form blocks on their respective, separate blockchains. The aim for both was to assert dominance, get as many blocks as possible, and show that their rule set is more reliable. Both sides mobilized some of their mining power, shifting it from BTC to BCH during the peak time of the conflict. That could have affected the Bitcoin (BTC) price, and therefore the overall crypto market, which notoriously started to slump at the time, eventually resulting in the market’s current, shredded state.According to statistics from Bitcoin Cash data aggregator Coin Dance, BCH ABC has been accumulating more proof-of-work (PoW) than BCH SV since the date of the split and, eventually, it won the allegiance of major crypto exchanges including Bittrex, Kraken, Bitstamp, and Coinbase, among others, who initially chose to halt BCH trading during the most active stage of the hash war: after several days of silence, those exchanges appointed the winner by assigning the original “BCH” ticker to the BCH ABC rule set. Other signs suggesting that BCH ABC has come out ahead include platforms like CoinMarketCap merging BCH and BCHABC listings, and cryptocurrency hardware wallet Ledger, which resumed its BCH services in the form of BCH ABC only.Further, news about BCH SV failure could have helped BCH ABC to further cement its winning position. On Nov. 19, Peter Rizun, chief scientist of Bitcoin Unlimited, reported that BCHSV suffered a blockchain reorganization (a situation when a node or a blockchain client needs to disregard blocks they have previously considered as accepted). Emin Gün Sirer, creator of the world’s first cryptocurrency to deploy a PoW concept and vocal critic of BCH, soon questioned BCHSV’s level of decentralization.“This should not be possible in a decentralized system.“You can only invalidate your own block and create a new tail if you're the majority miner. BCHSV is a centralized coin.”Nevertheless, Bitcoin SV is far from being dead. First, on Nov. 16, Binance, one of the largest players among crypto exchanges, opted to stay neutral in the fight: its CEO, Changpeng Zhao, announced that both tickers — BCHABC and BCHSV — “will stay” on his platform under their respective tickers, thus recognizing BCHSV as an independent entity. Currently, BCH ABC trades at $183 there, while BCH SV is set at $114. BCH price on other exchanges seem to correlate with BCH ABC price on Binance, as per CoinMarketCap data.Then, around Nov. 19, Kraken, the platform which initially claimed it would only support one of the two BCH chains – Bitcoin Cash ABC – launched trading of its counterpart chain, Bitcoin SV under the “BSV” ticker. Still, in the accompanying blog post Kraken warned its clients that “Bitcoin SV does NOT meet Kraken’s usual listing requirements,” adding that there are “many red flags” that traders should be aware of, including miner coercion:“Custodial losses taken on due to attacks originating from nChain or its affiliates will be socialized among all BSV holders on Kraken. Given the volatile state of the network and threats that have been made, Kraken cannot guarantee perfect custody of BSV.”Afterwords, on Nov. 23, billionaire entrepreneur and BCH SV supporter, Calvin Ayre, declared that the coin “no longer want[s] the name Bitcoin Cash [BCH]” in an article published on his own crypto media outlet CoinGeek.The statement clarified that Bitcoin Cash SV will continue to exist independently from Bitcoin Cash (BCH), and that the coin is in fact the “original” Bitcoin (BTC):“Bitcoin SV is the original Bitcoin not the original Bitcoin Cash.”Bitcoin (BTC), in turn, is referred to as “Segwit BTC” in the article.The author also accuses supporters of both BTC and BCH of having “tinkered it [Bitcoin] to death,” as their cryptocurrencies “abandoned Bitcoin’s core principles by abandoning Nakamoto consensus and trust in miners’ Proof of Work.”Ayre finished by saying that he has instructed his team to “start working with everyone” to release Bitcoin SV as an independent coin from Bitcoin Cash. The coin is scheduled to release as soon as next week during a CoinGeek event.BCH, in turn, has been steadily losing its value since the hard fork began. It trades at around $197 as of press time, according to Coin360."

than 300 payment methods is experiencing growing demand.","Nov 27, 2018",A company that enables visitors to buy Bitcoin using more than 300 payment methods has reported growth in the number of transactions being completed using US dollars – and says it is determined to dismantle the issues people have in earning and transferring their money freely.,"Paxful was launched in 2015, and has the goal of making it simple to buy cryptocurrency – a boon for people who haven’t done so before.Cash deposits and bank transfers can be used on its platform – with the company promising to deliver Bitcoin in less than an hour at an “awesome price.” Crypto can also be received instantly if Paxful customers opt for an online transfer via the likes of PayPal and Skrill, on the condition that they upload their ID for verification.Debit and credit cards – including those from major brands such as Visa and MasterCard – are another option. That said, the fees incurred by using these payment processors can mean that Bitcoin costs a little bit extra on average.Unlike other exchanges, Paxful also enables its customers to buy Bitcoin using gift cards, enabling them to swap unwanted presents for cryptocurrency. It accepts vouchers from an extensive range of retailers – including Amazon, Apple, the PlayStation Network, Google Play, Banana Republic, Walmart, Victoria’s Secret and many more.When it comes to these payment methods, Paxful uses a peer-to-peer marketplace where sellers connect directly with buyers. Those who are interested in exchanging their Bitcoin for gift cards can specify the minimum or maximum value of the vouchers they are willing to pay and set the exchange rate. This creates healthy competition among the sellers, as well as providing choice for buyers.Paxful says that keeping its customers safe – as well as their cash or crypto – is a top priority. Transactions go through an escrow service, with funds placed in the control of an independent third party until all of the terms have been met. This helps to prevent an unscrupulous seller from taking someone’s gift card or money without delivering the Bitcoin they promised.Disputes can also be raised whenever a transaction does not go to plan, with an impartial moderator intervening to settle the trade. In addition to these measures, Paxful has a customer support team who can answer queries 24 hours a day, seven days a week.The platform has also been proactive in preventing fraud and cyber attacks. Recently, it teamed up with an anti-phishing company to help track down fake mobile apps and websites which were purporting to have an affiliation with Paxful.As well as helping the public to get their hands on Bitcoin safely and securely, Paxful has made a concerted effort to engage in humanitarian projects that make a difference.The company is planning to complete building a second school to benefit children in the African nation of Rwanda through its #BuiltWithBitcoin initiative after receiving donations worth $100,000 in five cryptocurrencies.Boasting six classrooms, six full-time teachers, bathrooms and a water well, the school is the first to open in the area and was made a reality in collaboration with humanitarian organization Zam Zam Water.Paxful has bold plans to construct 100 African schools in the coming years – and is also devoted to other philanthropic causes, including providing scholarships to Afghan refugees. Ray Youseff, the platform’s CEO and co-founder, said: “We encourage the cryptocurrency sector to contribute more to humanitarian projects. The #BuiltWithBitcoin initiative is an example of bitcoin being used as more than a speculative tool but a testament to the usefulness of cryptocurrency.”"

Amazon was granted with two crypto-related patents. 18469 ...","Nov 21, 2018","On November 13, Amazon was granted two crypto-related patents. While the American e-commerce pioneer, with a revenue of over $177 billion, has not chosen to accept Bitcoin (BTC) and major altcoins as a payment option despite public interest and competitors’ experience, it has not ignored the subject altogether. In fact, Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company’s cloud computing arm, has contributed to blockchain adoption.","Amazon has a complex relationship with crypto. In April 2014, the e-commerce giant decided not to accept Bitcoin (BTC) citing customer preferences. Amazon payments head Tom Taylor told Recode in an interview:“Obviously it gets a lot of press and we have considered it, [...] but we’re not hearing from customers that it’s right for them and don’t have any plans within Amazon to engage Bitcoin.”Curiously, the move came just few months after Overstock.com, one of Amazon’s rivals, became the first major retail company to introduce BTC as a payment option and found initial success, as its CEO Patrick Byrne claimed that Amazon would have to “follow suit.”Taylor’s comment could have meant that the e-commerce giant would turn to cryptocurrencies once they see more exposure. However, the 2014 decision stays to date, regardless of the overall improved market capitalization and adoption, public petitions addressed to CEO Jeff Bezos, and some businesses being built around serving as the middlemen for Amazon customers willing to pay with digital currencies.Nevertheless, Amazon has not distanced itself from engaging with crypto altogether. In May 2014, not long after announcing it had no plans for crypto, Amazon was awarded a Bitcoin-related patent for the use of digital currencies as payment for cloud computing services on Amazon Web Services (AWS). It is worth noting, however, that the patent was filed back in March 2012, and crypto was mentioned as only one possible form of payment there.In November 2017, the e-commerce giant was reported purchasing a number of crypto-related domain names including “amazoncryptocurrencies.com,” “amazoncryptocurrency.com,” and “amazonethereum.com.” It was also noted at the time that “amazonbitcoin.com” redirects to the original Amazon URL.However, it could have been an attempt to shield the Amazon brand or avoid confusion with Amazon Coin, the company’s digital currency that was introduced in 2013 for Kindle e-book owners. The coin has not seen extensive use despite the documented public interest.In April 2018, Amazon won a patent for a subscription feed system described as a “streaming data marketplace.” Essentially, the company claimed, it could “identify [Bitcoin] transaction participants” for governments and law enforcement. The document was filled in June 2014 and showed that while the e-commerce giant might accept the idea of dealing with crypto, it put strong emphasis on the Know Your Customer (KYC) side of the business. That, in turn, would neglect a major part of Bitcoin’s ideology and design.Thus, Amazon has not shown itself to be exactly a pro-Bitcoin company. Nevertheless, its relationship with the underlying technology, blockchain, has proven to be much more fruitful.On December 5, Amazon Web Services (AWS) announced a partnership with R3 — a major blockchain consortium of over 200 members — to allow its Corda platform to become one of the first distributed ledger technology solutions (DLT) on the AWS marketplace. Corda is an open-source DLT platform designed to work within finance to operate complex transactions and restrict access to transaction data. Basically, it allowed users to deploy decentralized applications (dApps) onto the AWS platform and to create new apps directly.The news came as a shock, granted that just a few days before the announcement, AWS CEO Andy Jassy essentially criticized blockchain for not having use cases “beyond the distributed ledger,” noting that even those had very limited capabilities. Moreover, he reiterated the company’s policy not to “build technology because we think it is cool.”He did add, however, that AWS was interested in ways that blockchain could benefit their customers:“We are very intrigued by what customers are ultimately going to do there.”Still, there were at least three blockchain-based platforms on the AWS marketplace before Corda’s arrival and Jassy’s speech, which shows that Amazon’s initial interest in blockchain arose earlier in 2017.On April 19, 2018, AWS’s journey into blockchain continued. The cloud platform introduced its blockchain framework for Ethereum (ETH) and Hyperledger Fabric, allowing users to build and manage their own blockchain-powered DApps. Called AWS CloudFormation Templates, the tool was designed to avoid the time-consuming manual setup of one’s own blockchain network.Next month, in May, AWS partnered up with ConsenSys, a blockchain incubator started by Ethereum’s co-founder Joseph Lubin. Specifically, the e-commerce company collaborated with Kaleido — a blockchain business cloud that aims to help firms accelerate the “entire journey from experimentation and PoCs [proofs-of-concept] to pilots and production,” and is based on the Ethereum blockchain. Together, they aim to offer simplified blockchain cloud platforms for its clients so that they can “focus on their scenario, [without having] to become PhDs in cryptography,” as Kaleido co-founder Steve Cerveny explained to CNBC.Kaleido has since expanded to a full-stack platform dubbed “Kaleido Marketplace.” It reportedly “eliminates 80 percent of the custom code” needed to build a given blockchain project by providing an array of tools and protocols that are “plug-and-play,” spanning needs from back-end development to front-end app user interfaces.Currently, there are around 25 blockchain-oriented platforms hosted on the AWS platform, some of which are also reporting promising results. For instance, in September, a blockchain system developed by Australia’s national science agency (CSIRO) and Sydney University claimed to have set a benchmark of 40,000 transactions per second during a test on Amazon Cloud — for comparison, BTC infrastructure normally scales up to eight transactions per second, while ETH blockchain capability is set at 15 transactions per second.Amazon’s blockchain experiments have attracted recognition from mainstream players: for example, “Big Four” audit and consulting firm Deloitte has emphasized Amazon’s blockchain-related efforts in its October report, arguing that the e-commerce giant had been helping to stimulate technology adoption and contributing to improving the costs of operations on blockchain. Additionally, Bank of America (BoA) research analyst, Kash Rangan, told CNBC that blockchain is well-suited to some of the world’s largest corporations, noting:""Amazon will benefit from incremental cloud services demand from blockchain implementation, while improved supply chain tracking should make Amazon's retail operations more efficient.""While Amazon has been acquiring both cryptocurrencies and blockchain-related patents, it is fair to take them with a grain of salt — as the industry is still young, a lot of players, like the aforementioned Bank of America (BoA), which currently has the most of such patents, are merely trying to mark the field before the others get there. Consequently, not all patents (blockchain-related or not) are going to be put to use any time soon. For instance, in 2016 Amazon was awarded a patent for a system to deliver goods through a chain of underground tunnels, a highly ambitious and costful goal that is probably not the company’s top priority.On November 13, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) published two more Amazon patents related to methods for protecting the integrity of digital signatures and improving distributed data storage, filed in April 2018 and December 2015 respectively.The first patent document outlines a “signature delegation” method for “protecting the integrity of digital signatures and encrypted communications,” by allowing for the generation, distribution, validation, and revocation of one-time-use cryptographic keys. In the proposed system, these keys are arranged in what is known in cryptography as the so-called “Merkle Tree” structure, which is essentially a binary tree of hashes constructed from the bottom up.Amazon’s second patent, is related to distributed data storage. The filing proposes a “grid encoding technique,” using groups of collected “shards,” where each shard represents a logical distribution of data items stored in a given grid. The patent filing suggests this method can help minimize storage redundancy.While Amazon might be having more patents coming, the e-commerce giant is nowhere to be seen in the main part of patents, occupied by the likes of its Chinese counterpart Alibaba and IBM. Nevertheless, Amazon is set to continue its explanation of the technology, as the AWS platform continues hosting blockchain solutions, and the company is looking to expand its staff with more blockchain engineers."

The miner that solves the next block then dictates how the blockchain continues, as the block they mined on top of then becomes 'calonical' per Nakamoto consensus, because it has more work committed to it. Reorg itself is a situation when a node or a blockchain client need to disregard blocks they have previously considered as accepted.When the network agrees on which fork to use, the redundant block which will not see a continuation of the blockchain built on top of it, as it is “orphaned.”When blockchains experience congestion, however, information about blocks may reach miners slower than usual, meaning that miners keep mining blocks that are now obsolete, and if they are successful, one of the blocks will eventually need to be orphaned.In this aforementioned event, the BCHSV reorg came about due to the mining arm of cryptocurrency news publication Coingeek, a party in favor of BCHSV, orphaning its own blocks. It is not clear whether it was intentional or due to an error, but the event demonstrated that one pool possesses enough hashing power to revert blocks and transactions on BCH SV network.The events were relayed to social media by Peter Rizun, chief scientist of Bitcoin Unlimited.Emin Gün Sirer, creator of the world’s first cryptocurrency to deploy a PoW concept and vocal critic of BCH, continued the debate, noting that the possibility for miners to make their own blocks redundant raised questions about the BCHSV’s level of decentralization.“This should not be possible in a decentralized system,” he wrote, adding:“You can only invalidate your own block and create a new tail if you're the majority miner. BCHSV is a centralized coin.”BCHSV has seen limited uptake on major cryptocurrency exchanges, among which was U.S. platform Kraken, which issued a strongly-worded warning to users when it allocated tokens and opened trading.Prices have also declined, Kraken’s BCHSV/USD (written at BSV/USD) pair hitting lows of $32.40 Nov. 21. At press time, BCHSV is trading at around $49.77 on CoinMarketCap, down about 6.66 percent over a 24 hour period.Bitcoin Cash has drawn accusations over centralization before, veteran cryptographer Nick Szabo openly labeling the coin as “centralized sock puppetry” last year."

The release further specifies:“UnitedCorp believes that the defendants colluded to effectively hijack the Bitcoin Cash network after the November 15, 2018 scheduled software update with the intent of centralizing the network — all in violation of the accepted standards and protocols associated with Bitcoin since its inception.”On Nov. 15, the BCH network underwent an update, which divided the community into two main camps, those who support Bitcoin Cash ABC and those who support Bitcoin Cash SV. UnitedCorp states that the defendants took control of the coin’s network right after the upgrade using “rented hashing.” This allegedly led to the adoption of Bitcoin ABC rule sets, precluding other implantations from maintaining a democratic rule sets.UnitedCorp also alleges that on Nov. 20 the Bitcoin ABC development team put a “poison pill” into the blockchain by way of a “Deep Reorg Prevention” in order to strengthen control over the blockchain ledger. The move allegedly enables maintenance of control on implementations for future network updates.The suit seeks injunctive relief against the defendants and the cessation of perceived ongoing actions against the BCH network now and in the future. Additionally, UnitedCorp seeks compensation, the value of which it claims will be determined at trial.Bitcoin Cash has registered major losses on the day. The altcoin is down by over 20 percent over the last 24 hours and is trading at around $103 at press time, according to CoinMarketCap.Bitcoin SV (BSV), in turn, has seen noteable daily gains of over 27 percent, and is trading around $112 at press time. BSV’s maximum supply is 21 million, while its market capitalization is around $1.9 billion at press time."

has struck a blow to its domestic crypto mining industry by acting to ...","Nov 22, 2018","Norway has acted to end electricity subsidies for Bitcoin (BTC) mining facilities, Norway’s largest printed newspaper Aftenposten reported Nov. 21.","Until now, mining farms — in keeping with other power-intensive industries — paid a low rate of 0.48 øre ($0.05) per kilowatt. This will now rise to 16.58 øre per kilowatt as of January 2019, following an amended to the state budget agreement. One vocal parliamentary representative for the Socialist Left Party (SV) Lars Haltbrekken is quoted as strongly advocating the action, arguing:""Norway can not continue to provide huge tax incentives for the most dirty form of cryptocurrency output [...] [Bitcoin] requires a lot of energy and generates large greenhouse gas emissions globally.""As Forbes reported earlier this month, with the currently advantageous electricity subsidies, Norwegian farms are able to mine Bitcoin at an average cost of $7,700 per coin, according to data from Northern Bitcoin, a German-listed firm that mines cryptocurrencies in Norway.Aftenposten reports that the domestic industry interest group ICT Norway has responded with strong criticism of the government action; chief ICT economist Roger Schjerva has reportedly issued a sharp-toned statement, protesting:“This is shocking! [To change] framework conditions without discussion, consultation or dialogue with the industry. Norway scores high on rankings of political stability and predictable framework conditions, but now the government is playing a gambling role with its credibility.”There are nonetheless some within the local blockchain industry, however, who broadly agree with the government’s move. Aftenposten cites Jon Ramvi, CEO of Oslo-based blockchain advisory group Blockchangers, as saying that “less mining in Norway will reduce the prices of electricity for companies and people residing in Norway, meaning that we reap the benefits of these resources locally instead of giving it away to Bitcoin miners.”Ramvi added that ""more miners in the Bitcoin network does not make it faster or scale better. The only function of more miners is securing the network further,” arguing that the BTC network has been “extremely secure” for “over a year,” removing the need to incentivize more miners.A recent report from weekly crypto outlet Diar indicated that only “big guns” in the industry are still making profit from Bitcoin mining; smaller miners paying retail electricity prices shifted towards negative revenue for the first time this September as the costs of electricity rises."

By December 1998, the company’s share price surged to more than $300 per share, but right after the dot-com bubble burst in March 2000, the share price slumped to just under $6 per share. Over time, Amazon managed to become the second U.S. company to reach a market value of $1 trillion.Kerner said that current volatility is nothing compared to what longtime BTC investors have encountered, recalling a day in 2013 when the market fell by 70 percent overnight.  “This is what investing in crypto is all about,” Kerner added, also noting that the impact of all great technological changes is overestimated in the short term and underestimated in the long term.The venture capitalist further stated that Bitcoin is “the greatest store of value ever created,” adding that the leading cryptocurrency will surpass gold over time. When asked what could be behind the recent slump on the cryptocurrency market, Kerner argued that “crypto has been so weak because [for] most of it there is no underlying value outside of confidence.”Many industry experts have shared a positive outlook regarding the future of crypto market. Bart Smith, digital asset head at U.S.-based global trading and technology firm Susquehanna, said he is still a long-term BTC believer amidst the market crash, emphasizing that crypto trading is a “long game” and that “every great idea is volatile.”Spencer Bogart, a partner at the venture capital firm Blockchain Capital, also believes that crypto opportunities are “still gigantic” despite the current bear market. Bogart also expressed his “mono-crypto” position, claiming that Bitcoin has the “largest established network effect” and is “more than five times larger than the number two crypto.”"

The expert has stressed that although the current state of crypto market is opposite to last year’s — with bear markets doing “bear things” — it still does not diminish the overall “gigantic” potential of Bitcoin.In the interview, Bogart has also expressed his “mono-crypto” position, claiming that Bitcoin has the “largest established network effect” and is “more than 5 times larger than the number two crypto.” The Blockchain Capital partner noted that the crypto community has been looking for the “next Bitcoin” since the emergence of Bitcoin, and suggested that this commitment to altcoins is a “dangerous game to play.”Founded in 2013, Blockchain Capital aims to assist entrepreneurs in setting up global cryptocurrency and blockchain companies. According to Blockchain Capital’s website, the firm is one of the “oldest and most active venture investors in the blockchain technology sector,” having financed “72 companies, protocols and tokens since its inception.”Earlier in October, Spencer Bogart had predicted that Bitcoin’s price has almost hit its bottom, noting that “bad news” last year appeared to “have no effect on the markets,” while now “we are seeing the other side of that.”Recently, prominent Wall Street bull Tom Lee maintained his new prediction that Bitcoin will end the year at $15,000, citing the upcoming launch of the digital assets platform Bakkt by the operator of major global exchange New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), as well as the expected regulatory clarity, which will allegedly attract more institutional investments.Backed by Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), the NYSE has recently confirmed that it is targeting a launch of the Bakkt platform on Jan. 24, 2019.Yesterday, Nov. 20, the head of global trading and technology firm Susquehanna also claimed that he is still a long-term Bitcoin believer amidst the market crash."

However, how many people it is and what it may mean, it is still too early to say.”Skattestyrelsen did not mention which exchange was involved, but said the information had come via a tip-off from Finnish tax authorities.Finland is home to well-known international P2P Bitcoin trading platform LocalBitcoins, which this year implemented limited Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) processes for “high volume” account holders.The 2,700 traders involved purchased Bitcoin worth 49.7 million kronor ($7.55 million) and sold Bitcoin worth 53 million kronor ($8.05 million).“This is probably just the tip of the iceberg,” Bergen added:“The knowledge we gain about data mining, segments and methods in general will make us wiser in the area and benefit from our guidance and control work.”Denmark has traditionally painted a mixed picture of its attitudes to cryptocurrency.

The COO, Sonny Singh, made his forecast during an interview with Bloomberg Nov. 22.","In the midst of a bearish market picture – with Bitcoin down over 32 percent in value on the month – Singh said that he expects the next big price action to come when mainstream financial sector giants such as Fidelity and Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) start to launch their crypto-based investment products next year.The financial giants’ entry into the space could catapult Bitcoin’s price to as high as $15,000-$20,000 by the end of 2019, Singh told reporters.Aside from traditional financial incumbents’ launch of crypto-based products, Singh pointed to structural changes in the crypto market itself, with stalwart companies such as U.S. crypto exchange and wallet provider Coinbase and crypto bank Silvergate gearing up for possible initial public offerings (IPOs).Singh forecast that next year would therefore herald an “exciting” moment: the launch of a crypto-based exchange-traded fund (ETF) by a “Blackrock-type” company or a Fidelity product will energize the space as traditional players jostle for market dominance against “the Bitpays and Coinbases” of the sector.Singh nonetheless drew a firm distinction between Bitcoin and altcoins, arguing that:“There’s a night and day difference between Bitcoin and everything else. Bitcoin is the under pound gorilla, it’s the one that has the mass network effect… [the one] the traditional financial incumbents are building products around. Other [crypto assets] […] I don’t know what’s going to happen to them.”Remarking that “the ICO market is pretty dead right now,” Singh also suggested that signs of increased intervention from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) does not bode well for the future of the token space.In an interview this September, Singh outlined a broadly similar argument that the crypto markets are on the threshold of a certain “defining moment,” which will come with big institutional investor market entry, set to “become real” in 2019."

rallies well above year-to-date lows. 27698 Total views. 316 Total ...","Dec 2, 2018","Critics are pointing to large energy consumption by the Bitcoin mining industry as a threat to the global climate. However, CoinShares, a digital asset management firm, estimates that about 77.6 percent of Bitcoin mining is done using renewable energy, arguing the harm to the environment is much less than what it is made out to be.","After the mayhem in November, crypto markets are showing the first signs of buying at lower levels. The total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies peaked just above $138 billion today, a 20 percent increase over the year-to-date lows of about $115.101 billion.The markets are unlikely to switch from a downtrend to an uptrend in a short span of time –– we anticipate a few weeks of base building before cryptocurrencies launch a new uptrend. All the virtual currencies will not bottom at the same time and neither will they rally equally higher. Hence, an eye on the chart patterns can help traders enter the outperformers at the right moment.TRON (TRX) has overtaken Ethereum as the most popular decentralized application (DApp) platform in the world, according to DappRadar, a website that monitors DApp platforms.TRON’s founder and CEO Justin Sun said that the virtual currency will add privacy features to its network early next year. The company is also establishing a blockchain gaming fund, TRON Arcade, with an investment objective of about $100 million in the next three years.After TRX stayed in the range of $0.01587681–$0.02815521 for about three months, the bears broke below it last week. The breakdown had a lower target of $0.00844479, but the bulls are attempting to bounce off $0.01089965. Currently, the previous support of $0.01587681 will act as a stiff resistance. If the bulls succeed in rising and sustaining above this resistance, a rally to the 20-week EMA is likely.The TRX/USD pair has not been able to break out of the 20-week EMA since falling below it in early June. Therefore, if the bulls climb above it and the top of the range at $0.02815521, we can expect the start of a new uptrend. However, if the bears defend the resistance, a retest of the recent lows of $0.01089965 is probable.Some see Litecoin (LTC) as a failed experiment and they expect the price to fall further. However, others believe that the current fall is a buying opportunity and the digital currency can make a new high in the future. Let’s take a look at what the charts suggest.The LTC/USD pair has witnessed a massive erosion of wealth in recent months. Currently, the bulls are attempting to bounce off $28, a level not seen since mid-June of last year. The trend is down as the digital currency has failed to hold key support levels throughout the year. There has not been a noticeable bounce for the altcoin since April of this year.The RSI has also entered into the oversold territory, which increases the possibility of a bounce. The first resistance on the upside is $47.246, above which the recovery can extend to the next resistance zone of the 20-week EMA and $69.279. After such a massive decline, we anticipate the virtual currency to enter into a range and form a base, before starting a new uptrend. If, however, the bears sink below $28, the next support is at $19.752.NEM (XEM) is the third best performing cryptocurrency in the past seven days, rising closer to 8 percent.The bears broke below the range of $0.07790717–$0.13125258 on Nov. 24, but could not sustain lower levels. This shows buyers are willing to support the XEM/USD pair at lower levels.The virtual currency rallied back into the above range on Nov. 28. Currently, both the bulls and the bears are fighting for supremacy. The bulls want to keep the price inside the range, while the bears want to sustain below the range.If the bulls succeed, it will indicate that the recent breakdown was a bear trap. In such a case, the price is likely to gradually rally back to the top of the range, closer to $0.13. On the other hand, if the bears maintain the price below the range and sink below the Nov. 25 intraday low of $0.06155741, the next support on the downside is at $0.05.The moving averages are flattening out and the RSI is also climbing closer to 50 levels, suggesting a consolidation in the near term.Bitcoin (BTC) had its worst November since 2011, as the price fell 37 percent. Such a massive fall in a period of a month shows signs of distress selling by the bulls. Bottoms are generally formed during such periods of capitulation. Will the leading digital currency stage a comeback or sink further? Let’s try to find out.The BTC/USD pair is trying to find support close to the critical support zone of $3,000–$3,500. This is an important zone that should hold. A break down of this will further damage sentiment and can extend the fall to the next lower level of $1,752. However, we give it a very low probability of occurring.Usually, after violating a critical support – in this case, $5,900 – the price retests the breakdown level. If that happens, the digital currency can rally back to anywhere between $5,000 and $5,900, though it is difficult to pinpoint the exact level it will reach.The RSI has reached levels last seen in early 2015, which shows the kind of damage the digital currency has seen this year. We are seeing first signs of buying, but will need to see more to confirm a bottom.Work has started towards the upgrade of Ethereum (ETH) to Ethereum 1x, which will reportedly improve the network’s usability. The said upgrade might be activated by June 2019. In other news, the citizens of Manila have an opportunity to earn some Ethereum by cleaning up polluted beaches.The University of Basel, Switzerland’s oldest university, has conferred an honorary doctorate to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin for “outstanding achievements in fields of cryptocurrencies, smart contracts, and the design of institutions.”After showing promise through the middle of the year, the ETH/USD pair has turned weak, as it continues to break down at critical support levels. Currently, the bulls are trying to hold the psychological support of $100.The RSI has reached close to oversold levels, last seen at the end of 2016. This movement suggests that selling has been overdone and a bounce is likely. The first resistance on any rebound will be at $136.12, followed by $167.32.If the bears turn the digital currency down from one of the above-mentioned resistance levels, and sink it below $100, a fall to $66 is possible. After such a large fall, the price is likely to go through a bottoming process before embarking on a new uptrend. "

Additionally, the cryptocurrency’s energy-intensive verification process is “vastly less efficient” than systems that rely on “a trusted central authority like a central bank.”Even if Bitcoin should not necessarily be “worth zero,” Rogoff argued that national governments and “regulators are gradually waking up to the fact that they cannot countenance large expensive-to-trace transaction technologies that facilitate tax evasion and criminal activity.”This, in his view, places Bitcoin in a double bind, with implications for its future value: “take away near-anonymity and no one will want to use it; keep it and advanced-economy governments will not tolerate it.”While the economist noted that governments worldwide may in due time “regulate and appropriate” the innovations of the new asset class –– as shown by the interest of multiple central banks in digital currency issuance –– he argued that coorinatinated global regulation would eventually seek to “stamp out privately constructed systems,” with only certain geopolitical outliers as a possible exception:“The right way to think about cryptocurrency coins is as lottery tickets that pay off in a dystopian future where they are used in rogue and failed states, or perhaps in countries where citizens have already lost all semblance of privacy. It is no coincidence that dysfunctional Venezuela is the first issuer of a state-backed cryptocurrency (the “petro”).”Rogoff’s argument that “disgruntled” nation states –– Cuba, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Syria, and Russia –– are turning to cryptocurrencies under the burden of sanctions has been raised by multiple analysts previously. A report earlier this fall indicated that the government of North Korea was “laundering” crypto into fiat to evade U.S. sanctions. Iran is going one step further, exploring the creation of its own national cryptocurrency, according to a report this summer."

During 2018, users were googling more on how to purchase XRP, with ‘How to buy Ripple’ making it to fourth place in Google’s ‘How to...’ list, while Bitcoin is currently ranked eighth.The increased popularity of Ripple is likely to be concerted with a recent publicity push — particularly informally on social media.As Cointelegraph previously reported, despite overall Google searches for ‘Bitcoin’ coming down 75 percent as of June, the term was still more popular than household names such as Beyonce.In mid-November, as the contentious hard fork of top crypto Bitcoin Cash (BCH) sparked volatility across markets, worldwide search interest in ‘Bitcoin’ hit six-month highs, gently trailing off in subsequent weeks.At present South Africa, the Netherlands and Ghana represent the top three sources of ‘Bitcoin’ searches.Curiously, ‘Ripple’ searches meanwhile have remained practically flat since May."

The entire heard says to sell. Short sellers laugh away to the bank and many analysts call for a further fall. With majority of the news being negative, it sounds logically correct.","However, when the downtrend enters a capitulation, it usually signals a bottom. Going against the trend, at such times, turns out to be a profitable decision. A prolonged downtrend is also a good time to sell out the positions that don’t have sound fundamentals and shift into cryptocurrencies that have a bright future.Though the total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies has plunged about 87 percent from its highs, Bitcoin has managed to maintain its dominance above the 50 mark throughout the fall. This shows that its leadership position remains intact and we have to watch its price action closely to forecast direction for the entire crypto markets.   Bitcoin SV, born out of the Bitcoin Cash hard fork, is the only one among the top virtual currencies that has been in the green in the past seven days. Its outperformance helped it to overtake Bitcoin Cash in terms of market capitalization for a short period of time on Dec. 7.Currently, both the cryptocurrencies are trading with market capitalizations that are relatively close to each other.The BSV/USD pair has seen wild swings in its short trading history. From a high of $254.13 on Nov. 14, it plunged 84.83 percent to an intraday low of $38.528 on Nov. 23. From the lows, it pulled back 221.79 percent to reach an intraday high of $123.98 on Nov. 26.The recovery stalled at the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement level of the fall. Since Nov. 26, the digital currency has been trading in a range of $123.98-$80.352. A breakout of the range can result in a rally to $167.608, which is close to the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement level.On the contrary, if the price breaks down of the range, a retest of the lows is probable. Trading inside the range can be volatile; therefore, we suggest waiting for a breakout of the range for initiating any long positions.NEM and three other blockchain firms have come together to form a lobbying group in Europe to “create a unified voice for the blockchain industry at the European level.” NEM has been one of the stronger performers in this fall. Let’s see if it is showing any bottoming formations.While most other top digital currencies are making new year-to-date lows, the XEM/USD pair has not declined much in the past few days. Even after breaking down of the range $0.13125258-$0.07790717, the bears have not been able to push prices lower. This suggests demand on dips.If the price climbs back into the range and sustains it for three days, it will confirm that the markets have rejected the lower levels. Traders can initiate long positions above the 50-day SMA and expect a move back towards the top of the range.On the other hand, if the digital currency turns down from the 20-day EMA and breaks down of $0.06155741, the fall can extend to $0.05. We expect a decisive breakout or breakdown within the next few days.TRON CEO Justin Sun announced that Tron has joined Blockfolio Signal beta, which is a popular mobile cryptocurrency portfolio tracking and management network. Justin Sun’s war of words with its competitors, Ethereum and EOS, also continues. He said that his company will create a fund to “rescue” the developers of Ethereum and EOS, following a “collapse” of their platforms.For the past few days, the bulls are facing a stiff resistance at the 20-day EMA, which is sloping down. The price has gradually drifted close to the Nov. 25 low of $0.01089965. A break of the low will resume the downtrend that can stretch to $0.00844479.If the bulls scale the overhead resistance of the 20-day EMA, a rally to $0.0183 is probable. We expect the TRX/USD pair to remain range bound for a few days before making the next decisive move.A breakout above $0.0183 will signal strength and can be traded on the long side.Binance Coin made a large move during the week on the back of the announcement regarding upcoming release of Binance Chain. Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) hopes to host millions of coins and thousands of blockchains on the platform in the future.The upcoming launch of Binance’s decentralized exchange (DEX) also boosted sentiment. The constant complain of the naysayers has been a lack of mainstream usability. However, with a partnership with Tripio, Binance has offered the opportunity of using BNB at 450,000 hotel locations. Though the fundamentals are improving, let’s see what the chart forecasts.The BNB/USD pair gave up a lot of ground between Nov. 14 to Nov. 25. During this period, the price dropped by about 53 percent. Thereafter, the bulls attempted to bounce from the critical support zone of $4.8355125-$4.5200621. The pullback broke out of the 20-day EMA, which was trending down but the bulls could not sustain the higher levels.The digital currency turned around and slumped sharply on Dec. 6 and 7, resulting in a new low. The bears are attempting to resume the downtrend, while the bulls are trying to pull back from the current levels. The RSI is showing a positive divergence, which is a bullish sign. We anticipate a trend change if the price breaks out of $7 levels. Traders should wait for a new buy setup to form before investing.Though Bitcoin is the fifth best performer in the past seven days, it has continued to make new year-to-date lows. The SEC postponing the decision on the Bitcoin ETF did not go well with investors. The experts are divided whether the digital currency will slip further or will it bounce off the current levels. Let’s see what the charts forecast.The BTC/USD pair gathered momentum on the downside after it broke below the critical support of $5,900. The RSI on the weekly chart has slipped into the oversold territory for the first time since early 2015. The previous dip into the oversold zone had proven to be a good buying point, as the markets then entered a prolonged bull phase.The $3,000-$3,500 zone had previously acted as a support in mid-September 2017. Therefore, we anticipate a bounce from this zone this time too. If successful, we expect a retest of the breakdown levels of $5,900.  Hence, we have been on the lookout to buy.On the other hand, if the bears break below the support zone, the next major support is way lower at $2,000."

Gurbacs noted, “There is an increased regulatory and institutional drive towards greater transparency into the digital asset space.” He added that, “we hope to inspire greater confidence among investors and foster more fair and orderly digital asset markets.”While cash-settled Bitcoin futures contracts came to market on CBOE and CME as early as December 2017, the first physically delivered Bitcoin futures are targeted for launch in January 2019 on Bakkt, the digital assets platform created by the operator of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), Intercontinental Exchange (ICE).In November 2017, Nasdaq had first indicated it would be launching BTC futures by mid-2018, but soon said it would be deferring rollout in order to create a “unique enough” offering.As reported, Nasdaq’s planned futures contract will purportedly be the first of a set of “transparent, regulated and surveilled” digital assets products to be jointly launched as part of its recently announced partnership with U.S. investment firm VanEck.VanEck is also currently awaiting a final decision from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on its joint proposal for a physically backed Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) together with blockchain software and financial services firm SolidX."

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.","The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.At the start of the year, the total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies was above $828 billion and many expected it to touch $1 trillion. However, after the hype of last year, the current bear market has been bone-crushing with no end in sight. The bloodbath in cryptocurrencies has plunged total market capitalization to below $130 billion and falling.After the recent collapse, many analysts have forecast a further fall in prices and expect Bitcoin to bottom out around $3,000 or even $1,500. Others, however, believe that the fall is a good opportunity to buy for the long-term, as they believe that the fundamentals are improving.Another important recent development was that the costly Bitcoin Cash war has ended, with Bitcoin Cash SV deciding to move on, leaving Bitcoin Cash ABC in charge of the Bitcoin Cash brand name. Whether or not this will result in a pullback in crypto prices remains to be seen.NEM (XEM) is the best performer among the top cryptocurrencies in the past seven days, though it has slumped about 18 percent, showing bear dominance across markets.Though the bears succeeded in breaking down the range, they are struggling to sustain prices at lower levels. Buying at lower levels has kept the XEM/USD pair close to the range of $0.07790717–$0.13125258.The 20-day EMA has turned down and the RSI is in the negative territory, which shows that the bears have an upper hand. If they succeed in sustaining below the range, the fall can extend to the next support level at $0.05.On the other hand, if the bulls defend the bottom of the range and push prices higher, a range bound action is likely to ensue. A trend reversal will be signaled after the price sustains above the range. In such a case, the rally can carry the digital currency to $0.2. We suggest traders wait for the trend to change and a new uptrend to start before venturing out to buy it.Ripple (XRP) continues to be in the news as it announces new partnerships with various banks across the world. Though it has tied up with a few large banks elsewhere, it is yet to make an impact in the U.S. The latest rumor was that it might seal a deal with Bank of America, which would give a major boost to the digital currency.Such rumors are a great buying opportunity during a bull phase. However, during a bear phase, traders should be careful while buying the rumor because if it turns out to be false, prices might plunge.After holding out the week before last, the XRP/USD pair succumbed to selling in the past week. The pair has dipped close to the first support at $0.37185. If this support breaks, a retest of the year-to-date low of $0.24508 is probable. The zone between $0.22 and $0.24508 is likely to act as strong support.Long-term investors can wait for the prices to stabilize at lower levels and then buy a portion of their desired allocation. The remainder can be added at higher levels as the digital currency starts a new uptrend.If the bulls defend the $0.37185 level, the virtual currency will continue to remain in a tight range of $0.37185–$0.565. We anticipate a pickup in momentum if the bulls scale the overhead resistance of $0.7644. The target to watch on the upside is $1.28372. Though $0.96490 might act as a minor resistance, we expect it to be crossed.  The number of on-chain transactions on the EOS (EOS) network tops that of other popular cryptocurrencies, according to Blockchain Center. A report by BitMEX, a Bitcoin/dollar derivatives market based in Seychelles, has raised various question marks regarding EOS and has said that the protocol has a long way to go if it wants to challenge the dominance of Ethereum in the DApp world.The EOS/USD pair broke down through critical support at $3.8723, marking a new year-to-date low. If the price sustains below this level, the fall can extend to the next lower level of $3 and below that to $2.1531.The down sloping 20-week EMA and the RSI below 40 levels show that the path of least resistance is to the downside. The bearish view will be invalidated if the bulls quickly push the price above $3.8723 and scale the $4.49 mark. A trend change will be signaled if the digital currency breaks out of the $6.8299 range.Last year after Thanksgiving, Bitcoin (BTC) started its scorching rally that peaked at $19,531.9, rising 144 percent within a month. However, this year, the digital currency is in a firm bear grip and is struggling to hold on to support levels.Many have declared that the crypto bubble has burst and it’s all downhill from here. Bitcoin, however, has seen worse falls than these in the past and has recovered on every occasion.The launches of Intercontinental Exchange-backed trading platform Bakkt and a crypto asset custody service by Fidelity in 2019 are poised to attract the institutional money that has been slow to enter the asset class. A favorable decision on a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the U.S. could also result in the start of a new uptrend.The BTC/USD pair extended its downtrend and easily broke below the minor resistances of $5,450 and $5,000. Though the next logical support is way lower at $2,974–$3,504.99, we expect some support close to the $4,100 mark. The RSI is about to enter into the oversold territory for the first time since January 2015, which shows the extent of damage in the current fall.Any recovery will face a slew of resistances at $5,000, $5,450 and at $5,900. It is risky to try to catch a falling knife; hence, traders should wait for the virtual currency to find some buying support before entering long positions.  In a series of blog posts, the IOTA (MIOTA) foundation has announced that it is looking to remove the so-called Coordinator from the IOTA network. As the Foundation claims, this move will be a major step towards decentralization for the protocol.Recently automotive industry app developer High Mobility announced a partnership with IOTA. Under the new collaboration, developers at High Mobility will build new types of mobility apps based on IOTA’s ledger.The bears broke below the support at $0.4037 and continued lower, touching an intraweek low of $0.28. Currently, the MIOTA/USD pair is attempting to climb above $0.3193.The down sloping 20-week EMA and the RSI in the negative territory show that every pullback will be met with selling pressure. If the support at $0.28 breaks, the fall can extend to the next lower level at $0.1427, with a minor support close to $0.23 levels.On the other hand, if the price recovers from the current levels and rises above $0.4037, the digital currency might consolidate for a few weeks before attempting to start a new uptrend. We suggest traders wait for the trend to change before buying."

possible to pay local authorities and utility providers in Bitcoin.","Dec 10, 2018",A conservative member (MP) of the United Kingdom’s (U.K.) Parliament has said that making payments to local authorities and utility providers with Bitcoin (BTC) should be possible. The MP’s statements were reported by local news outlet Express.co.uk on Dec. 10.,"The article notes that Eddie Hughes, a member of the U.K. Parliament for the Walsall North constituency, described himself as a “crypto enthusiast with amateur knowledge.” He notes that blockchain gets a lot of attention and members of the parliament “have a duty to understand it.”Hughes further explained that he recently met with the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, which accepts cryptocurrency donations, and that the encounter made him think:“What’s to stop us [from] being able to pay council tax and other bills with Bitcoin?”Those declarations come shortly after, as Cointelegraph reported at the end of November, the United States state of Ohio announced that businesses will be able to pay their taxes in Bitcoin.Praising Ohio’s new BTC tax payment option, Hughes said in relation to the U.K.’s crypto stance:“You’re either ahead of the curve or you’re behind the curve, and our country is in an interesting position right now — we need to be seen as a progressive country.”The recent crypto market crash has reportedly eased the pressure on U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority to create “hasty” new crypto regulation. According to Reuters, the previously urgent need to create regulation had raised the risk of a heavy-handed approach that could potentially damage the industry.Now that the crash has happened, officials have indicated that they will take more time to ensure a more balanced legal framework.During a cryptocurrency-themed conference in London, Gillian Dorner, deputy director for financial services at Britain’s finance ministry, said that this is an opportunity “to take the time to look at that in a bit more depth and make sure we take a proportionate approach.”"

Pompliano gave his forecast during an interview on CNBC’s Squawk Box Nov. 26.","The partner at crypto investment firm Morgan Creek Digital Assets argued that while “Bitcoin was overvalued in Dec. 2017” – with selling pressure this year subsequently driving its price downwards – there are several important factors related to the asset’s long-term value that are important to remember:“First, [Bitcoin] is the most secure transaction settlement layer in the world, so it’s got to be worth something […] it’s the best performing asset class over the past ten years – it’s outperformed S&P, DOW, NASDAQ, etc. during the longest bull run. It experienced two 85 percent drops during that time, but [it’s] still up over 400 percent in the last two years.”Third, he added, all of Bitcoin’s price action in past years has been driven by retail investors – ahead of any meaningful involvement from major institutional players such as those now poised to enter the crypto space next year. Big players include Fidelity and New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) operator Intercontinental Exchange (ICE).Pompliano argued that the recent “wash-out” on the crypto markets is a barometer of retail investor patterns; throughout its retail-driven history in 2017, the cryptocurrency traded as a “highly volatile speculative asset.” By contrast, he continued, more recent institutional involvement is primarily conducted via less transparent over-the-counter (OTC) trades, where trends are not immediately apparent and harder to gain insight into.Pompliano was lastly asked about dwindling profit margins for cryptocurrency miners as the asset’s value tumbles. He conceded that outside of regions with abundant low cost power, such as China – where he claimed miners can mint Bitcoin for as little as $2,000-2,500 – we are seeing a similar “wash out” of miners in areas where electricity costs push expenses closer to $6,000 or $6,500. These latter, he said, “are underwater now.”As previously reported, Morgan Creek Digital assets is backed by the institutional investment house Morgan Creek Capital, which has $1.5 billion in assets under management. The firm launched a Digital Asset Index Fund in late August, which gives accredited investors indirect exposure to Bitcoin, Ethereum and eight other large market cap assets, although not pre-mined cryptos such as Ripple (XRP) and Stellar (XLM).Speaking yesterday, Vinny Lingham, CEO of identity management startup Civic, predicted Bitcoin will trade range-bound between $3,000 and $5,000 for at least three to six months; if the coin fails to then break higher, it could lose the $3,000 support as well.Bitcoin is currently trading at $3,730 by press time, down just over 6 percent over the past 24 hours."

In June, a Greek court ruled to extradite Vinnik to France. The Greek Supreme Court discussed Vinnik’s extradition to France on Nov. 19, but postponed the ruling to Nov. 29, as TASS reports.According to TASS, Musatov also accuses the judge of the Greek Supreme Court of ignoring him and his team:“The Greek Supreme Court's judge completely ignores the work of lawyers who cannot even file a petition. She does not give them an opportunity to speak or do it.”The lawyer stated that “[i]f there is no fair trial, he will inevitably be deported to the United States through France, where he will get something close to a life sentence, which equals death.”He then further clarified Vinnik’s reasoning stating that “after observing this situation, Alexander realized that he would either get a fair trial or die.”The head of the team of lawyers also explained that his defendant “understood that he does not have any other options and decided to go on a hunger strike on Monday in protest against this situation.”According to Musatov, Vinnik came to this conclusion when his Greek lawyer, Zoe Konstantopoulou, “openly” said during the Nov. 19 court session that “the court would not treat any citizen of an E.U. member country or Greece as it treats Alexander just because he is a Russian national.”As Cointelegraph reported this week, Konstantopoulou is also accusing the Greek Supreme Court of violating her defendant’s rights by failing to provide translations of court documents at his request."

'Methadone Clinic'. Mike Novogratz has said that the ICO market is “ ...","Dec 11, 2018",Mike Novogratz compared current cryptocurrency  market performance to a “methadone clinic” in an interview with Bloomberg Dec. 11.,"During the interview, Bloomberg asked Novogratz how coming from Wall Street made him different from most of the cryptocurrency community, which seem to treat cryptocurrency “almost like a religion.” Novogratz answered that, while he believes in the underlying technology, “when prices get stupid,” he sells.Novogratz also characterized Bitcoin’s (BTC) enormous growth in late 2017 –– which peaked at $20,000 per coin –– “a drug.” He called the period a “speculative mania,” adding that the “audience is more sober now — the drug is gone.”According to the hedge fund manager, the current market is characterized by “pessimism” and “fear,” with people expecting the leading cryptocurrency will go “to zero.” Novogratz, however, remains confident, concluding:“But it’s not going to zero. We’re at the methadone clinic.”During the interview, the former Goldman Sachs partner and hedge fund manager admitted that he thought Bitcoin “was going to hold at $6,200 [...] but then Bitcoin Cash decided to fork again.” The idea that the contentious Bitcoin Cash hard fork has been a major factor that instigated the current sell-off is widespread among analysts.Further explaining market fear and uncertainty that could have led to the most recent sell-off, Novogratz told Bloomberg:“At the same time [as the BCH hard fork] the SEC came out and sanctioned a few ICOs and said, ‘Oh, by the way, your investors can sue for damages.’ That scared the heck out of a lot of people.”When asked if Initial Coin Offerings (ICO) will “ever come back,” Novogratz stated that “the ICO market is pretty much dead right now.” He added however that “the SEC doesn’t want to kill this innovation” and that he expects a market for regulated security tokens in the United States.He explained that security tokens “aren’t things that go from $1 to $1,000” but instead they are “things that yield 14 percent” that will be sold to qualified buyers. He concluded, “that sounds a heck of a lot less sexy, but you’re going to see that business grow.”The Galaxy Digital founder also reiterated the popular idea that “Bitcoin is going to be digital gold, explaining:“That means [Bitcoin is] the only one of the coins out there that gets to be a legal pyramid scheme. Just like gold is. All the gold ever mined in the history of the world fits in an Olympic-size swimming pool. You’re out of your mind to think that pool’s worth $8 trillion. But it is because we say it is.”As Cointelegraph reported last month, Galaxy Digital lost $136 million in the first three quarters of this year, but Novogratz remains confident that crypto will “flip next year.”Last week, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Jay Clayton said that ICOs “can be effective” but that “securities law must be followed.”"

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.","The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.After the first signs of recovery, the opinion is divided on the current pullback in the market. Some say that it is only a dead cat bounce, while others believe that it is the start of a base building process that will result in a new uptrend. Michael Bucella of the crypto-focused investment firm BlockTower Capital said to CNBC that the smartest money has started investing.Nonetheless, Paul Donovan, Global Chief Economist at UBS, has said the digital currencies can never be currencies and are “fatally flawed.” After the recent fall, many are questioning the longevity of cryptocurrencies. The past rallies and sharp plunges show that the nascent asset class swings between periods of extreme optimism and pessimism.For the non-believers, this is not the space to be in. However, for the investors who believe in the long-term story of cryptocurrencies, Ric Edelman, founder and executive chairman of Edelman Financial Services, believes that it is a good time to start buying Bitcoin.Will we or anyone pick the exact bottom? No! A bottom can only be identified in the hindsight. Therefore, the traders can scale in the position, gradually building a portfolio. Let’s see which virtual currencies are showing buy setups.Contrary to our opinion, the pullback in Bitcoin did not even reach the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement level of $4,712.89. It turned down from $4,471.1 on November 29. This shows that the bears are unwilling to wait for higher levels to sell.  There is a minor support at the small uptrend line, below which a retest of the lows at $3,620.26 is possible. A breakdown of the year-to-date lows is likely to attract further selling, dragging the BTC/USD pair to $3,000 levels. This is an important level that should hold: a break of this can result in a plunge to $2,410.However, we expect the $3,500-$3,000 zone to hold. Hence, traders who went long on our recommendation can hold their positions. We shall close the position if we find that the bears are sustaining below $3,500.If the price bounces from the current levels, it can move up to $4,712.89 and $5,050.4. We can add more positions as the virtual currency rises northwards.Ripple triggered our suggested buy level on Nov. 28, but it could not rise above $0.4. Currently, the price has turned down and might retest the intraday lows of Nov. 25.The down trending 20-day EMA and the RSI below 40 levels will continue to attract sellers. A break below the support line of the descending channel can result in a drop to $0.24508. However, if the support holds, we anticipate a move back to the top of the range. Traders who have bought positions on our recommendation can hold with a stop loss of $0.3. The positions can be closed if the XRP/USD pair sustains below $0.3.The rebound in Ethereum fizzled out at $127.87. It continues to be in a downtrend but for the past seven days it has been trading inside the range $130.5-$102.2.A breakout of the range might face a minor resistance at the 20-day EMA, but we expect it to be crossed. The ETH/USD pair will face a stiff resistance at $167.32 and if this level is crossed, it will be at the 50-day SMA. We suggest traders wait for a trend reversal to be signaled before attempting long positions in it.Bitcoin Cash has extended its stay in the tight range of $204.76-$148.27. The longer the price remains in the range, the stronger the eventual breakout or breakdown will be.Both the moving averages are trending down and the RSI is in the oversold zone, which shows that the bears are in command. We had anticipated a breakout to the upside as the selling had been sharp and the BCH/USD pair was looking oversold. But a lack of buying and selling by the bears is threatening a breakdown of the range.If the price sustains below $148.27, the slide can extend to the next support of $100. On the other hand, if the bulls hold the bottom of the range and breakout of $204.76, we expect a rally to $242.9 and $272.14. Aggressive traders can ride this move up but as this is a counter-trend trade, please keep the position size small.When a support breaks down, it becomes the new resistance. The stronger the support, the stronger the resistance will be. Stellar has turned down from close to the overhead resistance of $0.184.The bears will try to breakdown the recent lows of $0.13427050 and plunge the XLM/USD pair to $0.08 levels. On the contrary, the bulls will try to defend the zone between $0.13427050 and $0.1547188. We shall turn positive on the virtual currency if the price sustains above $0.184.EOS is in a strong downtrend. After a day’s pullback, the fall has resumed and the price has made a new year-to-date low. The next support on the downside is at $2.4.The failure of the EOS/USD pair to breakout of the downtrend line shows that the bears are in command. The traders should wait for the digital currency to put in a bottom and show signs of stabilizing before going long.Litecoin remains in a downtrend, with both the moving averages trending down and the RSI in the negative territory. The pullback stalled just above the $36 levels, which shows a lack of buying at higher levels.The bears will attempt to make a new year-to-date low, while the bulls will try to defend the current lows. If the bears succeed, the LTC/USD pair can correct to $20 levels.However, if the bulls use the current fall to buy and form a higher low, it will indicate strength. The digital currency will show first signs of a trend change, if it sustains above the downtrend line. Until then, it remains vulnerable to a bear attack.The sellers did not even wait for the recovery to reach the 20-day EMA before offloading their positions. Cardano can retest the recent lows of $0.033065 within the next few days. If the bears break the support and make a new year-to-date low, the drop can extend to $0.025954 levels.On the other hand, if the bulls manage to hold the support, the ADA/USD pair might start a bottoming process. A trend change will be indicated when the price makes a series of higher highs and higher lows. Until then, the bears are likely to pounce on any pullback.The pullback in Monero was short-lived. Failure of the bulls to reach the first overhead resistance of $71 indicates lack of buying interest. The trend remains firmly down with both the moving averages sloping down and the RSI close to the oversold levels.A break below the $53 levels will resume the downtrend and can plunge the XMR/USD pair to the next support at $40. If the bulls defend the psychological support of $50, it will indicate buying at lower levels and will increase the probability of a bottom formation. Traders should wait for a new buy setup to form before initiating any new positions.The sharp pullback in TRON ended just above the 20-day EMA. Currently, the bears are attempting to push prices towards the recent lows.The trend remains down and the bears have successfully defended the first resistance level, which shows that the sellers are in command. If the TRX/USD pair sinks below $0.01089965, the next target on the downside is $0.00844479.On the other hand, if the bulls manage to hold prices above the Nov. 25 intraday low, the digital currency might enter a consolidation. There are no signs of a trend reversal yet.The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. The charts for the analysis are provided by TradingView."

This corporation has a supervisory role over insured banks and it reports to the Nigerian Federal Ministry of Finance.During an NDIC forum, Ibrahim Umaru described his concerns about Bitcoin (BTC), disintermediation and fintech in general:“The partial disintermediation of the banking system arising from proliferation of digital currencies such as Bitcoin, as well as the activities of fintechs are all of critical concern to the corporation.”In March, the Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation also warned Nigerian citizens against the use of cryptocurrencies, stating that they don’t recognize them as legitimate currencies. Adikwu Igoche, an NDIC executive, said that cryptocurrencies are not authorized by Nigeria’s Central Bank and consequently aren’t insured by them.As Cointelegraph reported in November, the presidential candidate of Nigeria’s leading opposition party has promised legitimizing crypto and blockchain regulation. In his “Get Nigeria Working Again” policy, he declared his aim to “speed up the economy positively through blockchain and cryptocurrency.”Moreover, the local government is partnering with startups to develop blockchain in Nigeria, as Cointelegraph reported last October.However, Chimezie Chuta, the national coordinator of the first blockchain conference held in Nigeria last year, noted some difficulties with embracing fintech innovation. Namely, he explained that trying to change the common point of view that Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are MLM and Ponzi schemes requires many resources."

stance, said the future of a Bitcoin ETF is still uncertain.","Dec 7, 2018",A commissioner of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said ‘not to hold your breath’ waiting for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) at the Digital Asset Investment Forum held in Washington D.C. Dec. 5.,"Hester Peirce, dubbed “Crypto Mom” by the community for her dissent with the SEC’s decision to reject a Bitcoin ETF proposed by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, said that a crypto or Bitcoin ETF is “definitely possible,” but it could be years away:“Definitely possible could be 20 years from now or it could be tomorrow. Don’t hold your breath. The SEC took a long time to [establish] Finhub. It might take even longer to approve an exchange traded product.”According to Pierce, she is also trying to convince her colleagues “to have a bit more of an open mind” when it comes to crypto adoption, but it might take a long time.Regarding the possibility of Bitcoin institutionalization, Peirce said that the SEC sees a lot of institutional and retail interest and will interact with it in many ways. She further added:“I think we need to encourage institutionalization in crypto space. That’s not what the people in the space want, but I think there are institutional folks who want to be in this space [...] And the best way that we can offer retail investors to get into this space is through a place that’s more institutionalized.”When asked about recent SEC enforcements, “Crypto Mom” said that people have to comply with the law, but the government is obliged to figure out whether the regulation is preventing people from realizing new or innovative ideas.“I want to make sure that the doors to innovation are open wide enough, and they’re not too constrained by regulation,” she concluded.In a recent interview SEC Chairman Jay Clayton refrained from providing any specific time frame for a Bitcoin ETF, but instead reiterated the SEC’s stance. “I’m not going to comment on timing or anything like that, but we’ve been clear on some of the issues that are of concern to us,” he told CNBC."

15, resulting in two competing chains Bitcoin ABC and Bitcoin SV. As ...","Nov 22, 2018",Over the last 10 days the cryptocurrency markets have endured a massive sell-off across the board.,"There are a number of reasons that have led to the highly bearish sentiments on the market but seeing red has been difficult for many. As the value of Bitcoin and numerous altcoins have continued to decline to depressing levels, and a certain amount of panic has ensued.Cointelegraph has reached out to various industry professionals to explore the reasons behind this most recent slump in the market and what to possibly expect in the coming weeks and months.To understand why the markets have plunged into the red, one must explore the varying socioeconomic factors that have had a negative effect with investor sentiment on traditional and cryptocurrency markets.Renowned Wall Street investor, Tom Lee, provides an astute analysis of the current crypto climate.Firstly, Lee points to the recent Bitcoin Cash fork has been a major talking point over the past few weeks and the build up to the hash rate war caused serious uncertainty in the market. Last week Coinshares CSO, Meltem Demirors, said this has led to institutional investors taking money out to avoid the risk and uncertainty around the hard fork.The contentious split in the Bitcoin Cash blockchain occurred on November 15, resulting in two competing chains Bitcoin ABC and Bitcoin SV. As a result, the value of BCH has suffered just as much as the rest.In addition to this, Lee believes that regulatory pressures have played a role in the bearish atmosphere, highlighting the SEC’s decision to institute the first ever levies against a couple Initial Coin Offerings (ICO) that were deemed to have actually been securities offerings. Another contributor to negative sentiments are reports of fresh investigations into the affairs of controversial stablecoin Tether (USDT).Global pressures have also taken their toll and Lee points to trade tensions, central banks tightening up policies, as well as Brexit contributing to declining market liquidity.The outlook for traditional markets have been just as bleak, with analysts forecasting a looming “flash crash” in the wake of a sell off in the cryptocurrency and oil markets. Lee summed this up as a sign of the times:“Markets around the world are fragile and panic and sentiment are playing a disproportionate role right now. Does this mean Bitcoin is broken? No. The use case is still there but in the short term, panics are panics.”eToro senior market analyst, Mati Greenspan, echoed these sentiments, highlighting the downtrend in various global stock markets in his daily market updates over the past few days.NASDAQ Composite 5-days chart. Source: Yahoo FinanceS&P 500 5-days chart. Source: Yahoo FinanceDow Jones Industrial Average 5-days chart. Source: Yahoo FinanceCombined with a recent breakout and central banks tightening their belts, the markets have seen a swathe of red. As the Wall Street Journal reported midweek, governments may need to stimulate their own economies as central banks tighten their belts.Economic tensions have also affected global trade and higher interest rates aren’t helping the situation, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.As Greenspan explained, all of these factors have contributed to the stresses across multiple markets.“There are a lot of side stories at the moment but I feel the major driving factors are the technical breakout that we saw last week and the global macroeconomic cycle that is currently hitting the stock market. In 2017 we saw abundance across all markets due to central bank loose money policy. Now that the central banks are raising rates again, money may become scarce and people are taking a lot of their investments off the table.”While the Bitcoin Cash fork has been identified as a major factor in this most recent downturn, others have pointed to the fact that the crypto markets have showed signs of a serious decline in recent weeks.As previously reported by Cointelegraph, analysts noted that Bitcoin was struggling to move into an uptrend support. The preeminent cryptocurrency was unable to move past the lower $6,000 regions. Trade volumes and activity were low and uncertainty grew, leading to the aggressive selloff.Gabor Gurbacs, digital asset strategist and director at VanEck, told Cointelegraph that traditional markets had endured corrections as businesses looked to consolidate before the end of the year.“During the past month, however, Bitcoin and digital assets were fairly stable while the equity and bond markets have gone through a significant correction. The recent turbulence is due to the combination of some systematic end of the year selling (that is businesses are closing their books) and some mess around the Bitcoin Cash fork.”In line with this analysis, Anthony Pompliano, host of popular crypto podcast and newsletter “Off The Chain,” has been addressing the current market woes over the past fews days. Responding to Cointelegraph, Pompliano highlighted three driving factors for the recent downturn:“Technicals showing more downward movement, historical analysis shows we need to go further, and psychological argument is there is not enough blood in the streets. Add in the selling pressure from funds and ICOs, you get a perfect storm for further market contraction.”Simply put, the low trade volumes and high uncertainty caused a sell-off that led to further panic selling. Summing this up succinctly, respected blockchain entrepreneur and industry advisor, Vinny Lingham, offered Cointelegraph a collected analysis of the current climate:“It's a usual downtrend in the bear market that has characterized much of 2018. The recent Bitcoin Cash contentious fork, combined with regulatory uncertainty regarding ICOs with recent SEC decisions against some token sales, added to the overall negative sentiment.”Price predictions are notoriously difficult to make in the cryptocurrency sphere but analysts are able to glean a lot from price movements and charts.According to Greenspan, it is not easy to make any assumptions of what the markets will do in the next six weeks and he believes things could go either way:“It's impossible to say for sure. Now that Bitcoin has broken the key psychological level of $5,000 the next logical level of support we can spot on the graph isn't until $3,000. It doesn't necessarily have to get there though. If it turns around now it would be a very bullish sign indeed.“I feel like the last of the panic sellers are now showing their hands. There are many cryptotraders who are happy to go on hodling even if we do see lower prices. As well, the incoming large financial institutions are most likely accumulating already at these prices.”Pompliano offered a more philosophical outlook in his latest newsletter, highlighting the fundamental aspects of Bitcoin as a saving grace that cannot be controlled or enforced by any single entity:“It is important to remember that Bitcoin is not a traditional asset. There is no monetary policy decision that will be the catalyst for a recovery. The government can’t deem it too big to fail. There is no one who can step in and halt trading. Bitcoin lives and dies on its own.“While that may be scary to traditional market investors, this is the attraction to true crypto believers. They understand the asset will have volatile swings on a frequent basis. They know that there are few synthetic protections in place for investors. Bitcoin is the ultimate test: How much conviction do you truly have?”Even at current levels, Lee has produced a fairly optimistic outlook for the cryptocurrency markets before the end of the year. Lee reiterated his $15,000 Bitcoin price prediction earlier this week, even amid deepening lows. Lee believes further regulatory clarity will also ease uncertainty, which has gripped the space for most of 2018.The Fundstrat co-founder believes that institutional investors will be the driving force behind a market resurgence. This will be led by the predicted launch of Bakkt in January 2019, a digital assets platform created by The Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), the operator of leading global exchanges, including the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).The bearish climate led to Lingham producing a far more conservative outlook leading into December and the new year. He said it was hard to see Bitcoin breaking past $6,000 in 2018 – and stressed the need for blockchain projects to create widely usable solutions:“The market needs to find and prove more use cases, companies that are building on top of blockchain need to prove real utility. The industry needs to start to show technology adoption beyond pilots in 2019 and create value add. The market has had too many pipe dreams and Lambos in the past 2 years. The climate can change once more companies with solid use cases emerge from their development cycles, gain traction and prove sound business value to make a difference. Ones who won't hit these milestones will continue to be wiped out.”As of November 22, the crypto markets look to have stopped their drastic slide, with cryptocurrencies’ prices still being shaky, but seeing only mild losses.Source: Coin360.io"

Fans. EOS and Steemit executive Daniel Larimer has revealed ...","Nov 29, 2018","Daniel Larimer, the CTO of blockchain company and EOS developer Block.One, has plans to develop a new cryptocurrency side project, he said in Telegram messages Nov. 28.","Larimer, also known as BM in developer circles, gave only vague information about plans for a “hypothetical token,” which would be “immutable, non-programmable, and limited to a currency role.”The token, if launched, would mark the latest contribution from Larimer to the altcoin world, the developer also holding the titles of co-founder of blockchain social network Steemit and creator of DAO BitShares.On Telegram Wednesday, Larimer said he had “stumbled upon” the concept for a new currency-focused token while working on EOS “security and scalability.”“...I stumbled upon a new set of tradoffs [sic] for a potential crypto token and I have merely been exploring whether there is a market for those tradeoffs,” he wrote in the public Telegram group.Along with refuting claims that he plans to quit EOS, Larimer added that the token “would in no way compromise the much larger use cases” for the platform.In a separate Telegram group the same day, a long list of attributes for the token appeared, with Larimer giving it the bizarre title “MonerEOS” – seemingly a mash-up of privacy-focused altcoin Monero (XMR) and EOS.“Crypto people will hate it,” he claimed in a message.EOS has courted controversy in recent weeks after moderators reversed previously-confirmed transactions, leading to renewed criticism of its governance model.Larimer had said in October that EOS was not focused on providing decentralization.At the same time, Steemit has also encountered fresh teething problems, this week announcing it was making over two-thirds of its workforce redundant.Perhaps unsurprisingly in the current climate, commentators reacted coolly to the new token.“Dan Larimer is already working on his next project... which sounds like Bitcoin but I bet he needs a lot of funding for it first,” Twitter pundit and investor WhalePanda wrote Nov. 29.Reddit responses also focused on the developer’s reputation, insinuating that Larimer’s previous projects had suffered from his tendency to shift gears quickly."

Revenues",https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-crypto-market-fall-influences-mining-hardware-sales-and-producers-revenues,"But Bitcoin mining has, at least for now, and most likely in the future, 
moved into the court of bigger players with deep pockets.” Miners' 
Revenues ...","Nov 19, 2018","A year long bear crypto market appears to have had a negative impact on the profitability of cryptocurrency mining. In spite of this, Bitcoin miners still managed to generate $4.7 billion in profit in the first six months of 2018. Constantly growing competition between big mining pools and the increasing difficulty of Bitcoin’s algorithm make getting the first cryptocurrency less profitable and weight the scales against small players.","Miners shut off their machines, and card manufacturers suffer losses. In particular, AMD representatives, whose last quarter fiscal report, published on Oct. 24, demonstrated that revenues from the sale of mining Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) were “negligible.” Presumably, Nvidia and Bitmain could also be in the same predicament and at this point, investors, miners and GPU manufacturers are probably all wondering what it will take to shake the cryptocurrency market from its current malaise.A year ago, the situation on the mining hardware market was different. Jon Peddie Research shows that in 2017, miners bought 3 million devices for more than $700 million, with Bitmain having the estimated share of $3-4 billion, which surpassed Nvidia’s and AMD’s revenues for the same period.The increase in the supply of GPU cards, which was observed in the second quarter of last year, can be primarily linked to the growing demand among Ethereum (ETH) miners, according to Jon Peddie Research. A similar leap was already seen in 2013 as a result of a massive purchase of Bitcoin and Litecoin by miners.The demand for Ethereum led to evolution in the GPU market as professional Bitcoin miners switched over from GPUs to custom ASICs resulting in a further surplus of mining graphics cards on the secondary market.Amid increasing demand, mining equipment prices grown sharply — the cost of flagship chips rose by 25 percent, with Nvidia’s GeForce 1080 commanding more than $1,000 during the market peak.Since the Bitcoin's dive in January, when in just a month it lost half of its value from the $20,000 landmark high, the situation for miners worsened — the price of the currency broke the mark of $5,800, and card manufacturers announced the decline in the revenues from mining hardware sales.These factors led to a drop in mining devices prices. As earlier reported by Cointelegraph, in July AMD’s OEM 4GB RX 580 six-pack was sold out at the price of $2,500, while in April it was available for $3,600. An Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 Founders Edition, 8GB GDDR5X PCI Express 3.0 Graphics Card was sold out at a price tag of $1,050 in the same month, though in July its price wasn’t higher than $709.Despite the fall in the cryptocurrency market, Bitcoin miners' revenues over the first three quarters of 2018 amounted to a record $4.7 billion, with a monthly profit of 57,000 BTC. For example, the entire past year brought users $1.4 billion less. However, the ever-increasing competition and growing network complexity make mining Bitcoin less profitable, especially for small players, as reported in the latest study made by the analytical company Diar.Nevertheless, analysts state that September was the first month when private miners’ profits went into the negative due to the increase of computing power.According to Diar, only large pools can still earn on Bitcoin mining:“With big mining operations on low electricity costs running at anywhere between 50-60 percent gross profit from Bitcoin revenues, the market has a lot of room left to grow and, profits to squeeze. But Bitcoin mining has, at least for now, and most likely in the future, moved into the court of bigger players with deep pockets.”Miners’ total income was also not at the point of growth, as 2018’s stats ($11.5 million) is 21 percent lower than $14.7 million value of the same period last year, and significantly lower than the maximum revenue of $53 million observed during the High Yield Investment Program (HYIP) era in mid-December 2017.Bitcoin miners may have run a losing business since the end of September — this conclusion was made by analyst Barclay James, who calculated a special formula to find the price of Bitcoin at which miners would no longer generate enough profit to cover operational costs. The value obtained is within the range of $6,400-6,500 per coin. A lower threshold was offered by the other analytical agency called Fundstrat, which analysts suggested that most miners may leave their rigs if Bitcoin drop $3,000-$4,000 per Bitcoin.Massive abandonment of the market by owners of small mining farms in China as a result of a prolonged “bearish” cryptocurrency market speaks about the decline in private miners’ interest.One of these miners tells that in the second half of 2017, when cryptocurrency prices reached a historic high, he invested hundreds of thousands of yuan in the purchase of nearly a hundred devices. The expectations were not met, the miner confesses:“By mid-June, my mining business’s profit margin had dropped by 90 percent. One of my friends who also mines altcoins suffered more, nearly losing all his investment.”The decreasing interest of miners towards graphics cards is not the only reason for the decline in the mining equipment production market, analysts from Jon Peddie Research explained. The company has published its Q2 2018 report containing data on the GPU market in general and the segment of discrete video cards in particular. The April–June’s figures were more modest than the statistics of the last quarter, which is also explained by the seasonal factor – the figures for the second quarter are usually smaller than those for the first one – as suggested by analysts.Overall GPU shipments increased 0.2 percent since the last quarter. AMD’s shipments decreased -1 percent, Nvidia’s -7.5 percent, while Intel increased their shipments by 2.6 percent.The negative trend is also demonstrated by year-to-year numbers. Total GPU shipments decreased -3.3 percent, with discrete GPUs down -4 percent from the last quarter.Did the fall of the cryptocurrency market affect the stock indexes of mining hardware colossi? A closer look at AMD and Nvidia charts show that the decline in share value was likely caused by a decrease in sales, rather than by cryptocurrency market correction.AMD stocks fell by 9 percent, after Oct. 26, the company published a quarterly report. Within a month, the company’s shares prices dropped by nearly 48 percent and experts believe that the main reason behind this decline was the fall of miners’ interest in video cards.Kinngai Chan, an analyst at the Summit Insights Group, told Reuters that “AMD had too high an exposure to the crypto-currency market,” meaning that miner's acquisitions have significantly increased the company's revenues.AMD’s fiscal report has also shown that the actual revenues decline of $150 million instead of $50 million expected. The surplus of GPU cards was formed due to the cryptocurrency boom in the first half of the year, which forced AMD to “ramp up” the production of core products.Though mining represents a ""very small percentage"" of the company’s overall business, according to AMD CEO Lisa Su, on Nov. 5 it has announced the partnership with seven major tech companies to produce eight new cryptocurrency mining rigs boasting “Ultimate stability,” “24/7 performance”, and “Enterprise-level quality.” The main reason of this production is said to be meeting the various aspirations of “innovative blockchain platforms,” which can be also related to the company’s expectations of the GPU sales for miners in 2019.AMD is not the only chip producer which stocks have been affected by the state of cryptocurrency markets. Nvidia’s shares fell by 4 percent after its Q3 report estimations announcement on Aug. 16, which demonstrated that its revenue from the sale of video cards in the second quarter of 2018 amounted to $18 million instead of the expected $100 million. In total, October’s drop comprised nearly 36 percent, with the stocks prices falling from $289 on Oct. 1, to $185 on Oct. 29. Nvidia’s Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress told the Wall Street Journal:“Whereas we had previously anticipated cryptocurrency to be meaningful for the year, we are now projecting no contributions going forward.""The final Q3 fiscal report, published by the company on Nov. 15, revealed that demand for Nvidia’s GPUs among crypto miners has dried up, as reported by Cointelegraph. The overall reported revenue for Q3 comprised $3.18 billion, which is 21 percent higher compared to $2.64 billion the last year, and 2 percent higher than the previous quarter value. However, the latest numbers occurred to be lower than the company expected. In August Nvidia’s analysts predicted its Q3 revenue to be between $3.19 billion and $3.32 billion.The manufacturer’s founder Jensen Huang added that the company’s revenues for the next year could be reconsidered since “near-term results reflect excess channel inventory post the cryptocurrency boom, which will be corrected.”Decreasing revenues can have also been driven by the increased competitiveness of Bitmain. In March, Wall Street firm Susquehanna has changed the rating of AMD from neutral to negative and lowered the price forecast for shares in GPU processing manufacturer Nvidia, citing the growing competition from Bitmain’s ETH mining ASICs. The new target price for AMD shares was revised from $13.00 to $7.50, and Nvidia’s forecast was decreased from $215 to $200 at Friday’s market close.The dominance of ETH ASIC miners could negatively affect AMD and Nvidia, according to analyst Christopher Rolland from Susquehanna Financial, companies whose graphics cards for ETH mining comprise 20 and 10 percent of the companies’ respected revenues.While GPU cards prices haven’t dropped significantly, Bitmain has been deliberately selling its latest and the flagmanship Bitcoin ASIC Antminer S9 at a discount, BitMEX Research reported.In total for the last year and the first quarter of 2018 Bitmain reportedly sold about two million Antminer S9 models. According to the researchers, who calculated the disclosed gross profit margin of the company in 2017 and the indicative cost of each ASIC chip, Bitmain’s profit margin for the Antminer S9 occurred to be negative with the value of 11.6 percent.Crypto analyst, Samson Mow, critical about Bitmain’s activity, has calculated that Antminer S9 prices had dropped by 85%, and the company had lost $600-700 millions in Q2.Why is Bitmain raising capital so fast & only showing Q1 results to pre-IPO investors? We're well into Q3 now. The reason is Q2 was a disaster. Bitmain is sitting on a massive $1.24 billion USD in inventory & S9 prices dropped by ~85%! Q2 losses range in the $600-700 millions. pic.twitter.com/fVYcDRTvBpHowever, decreased prices have nothing to do with the miners’ falling interest – researchers suggest that the company employed a strategy to outsell its competition by underpricing its products:“These low prices are likely to be a deliberate strategy by Bitmain, to squeeze out their competition by causing them to experience lower sales and therefore financial difficulties. In our view, herein lies the key to one of the main driving forces behind the decision to IPO. A successful IPO may increase the firepower available to continue this strategy and eliminate an advantage rivals could have by doing their IPOs first.”A more serious threat that may affect the viability of ASIC miners, and the sales of the mining giant, are hard forks of mineable coins, to which more and more companies took a stake in. In 2018, at least two projects held hard fork to protect their networks against 51 percent attacks, and this threatens Bitmain’s monopoly in the market, with two of them planning it in the near future.In April, Monero’s fork disabled mining with Antminer X3, in October, Sia disabled Antminer A3. Their upgrades are followed by scheduled hard forks of Bitcoin Cash (BCH) (Nov. 15) and Ethereum (presumably in January 2019), which could potentially devalue Antminer S9 and E3, designed for the mining of these coins.To strengthen its position on the market Bitmain continues to compete with other mining hardware producers. On Nov. 5, the company has released two new Antminer models, equipped with next-generation ASIC chips to ensure “industry-leading hashrates.” Announced on October 22, “Overt ASICBoost” firmware upgrade, which was designed to increase mining devices efficiency, along with the deployment of 90,000 Antminers S9 being carried out by Bitmain to get the mining pool dominance ahead of the Bitcoin Cash hard fork, can potentially increase the company’s revenues of Q3 2018.The decline in demand is also confirmed by smaller video card manufacturers. Gigabyte recently published a financial report for the last month, which showed that its revenue in June fell by 31 percent compared to last year and by 30 percent compared to the previous month. Additionally, revenues for the second quarter of 2018 fell by 33 percent compared to the first, according to the report.A similar situation faces TUL Corporation, which produces video cards under the PowerColor brand. The company's earnings for June occurred to be 28 percent lower than in May. For the entire second quarter, the decline was 59 percent compared to Q1. The numbers are significant, given that up to 95 percent of the company's revenue comes directly from the sale of AMD video cards.The opposite financial results have been reported by Canadian mining hardware producer Hut 8, on Nov. 8. As stated in its fiscal document, the company’s revenue reached a record $13.5 million for Q3 (126 percent higher than for the same period in 2017), and $27.7 million for last three quarters.Hut 8 attributed the increase to its set up of sixteen Bitfury BlockBoxes in September at its mining facility in the City of Medicine Hat, for an aggregate of 56 BlockBoxes at that site. Each BlockBox reportedly contains 176 mining servers and has a hashrate of 13.7 Ph/s.Among the reasons the company gives for the lower financial results in 2017, there is the BTC price drop, the increased competition, and the record high temperatures in Alberta. Hut 8 also expects that the efficiency of ASIC chips will rise during the colder months, which will improve performance in the next quarter.Another manufacturer said that the profit it received in Q3 2018 exceeded that for the same period last year, despite the fact that its revenues for cryptocurrency mining business were down due to the “worsening external environment” and “increasing depreciation cost.”On Nov. 12, Japanese IT giant GMO Internet has released its Q3 fiscal report revealing that company’s crypto-related activity, including mining hardware production and crypto exchange operation, had brought about $22.8 million in revenue over the third quarter “in just a year since the launch.”If the data supplied by researchers and analysts is to be believed, then Bitcoin miners have been operating at a significant loss since June and many individuals have abandoned the practice altogether. The growing hash power of BTC will remain lucrative to those who are able to mine at an industrial scale or operate in countries where the operational and energy costs are favorable. The survival of Bitcoin and the network hashrate remaining within the range between 40 and 50 million This demonstrate that there is still significant activity in the global cryptocurrency mining sector and the confidence of miners may return sooner or later. Smaller scale miners are fleeing in droves and the distribution of players is rebalancing as the emergence and consolidation of mining farms takes place, experts at Diar.co suggest:“Bitcoin mining has, at least for now, and most likely in the future, moved into the court of bigger players with deep pockets.”Therefore, “big mining operations on low electricity costs running at anywhere between 50-60 percent gross profit from Bitcoin revenues” will continue to make hefty profits and analysts believe that “the market has a lot of room left to grow and, profits to squeeze.”Jon Peddie Research also doesn’t expect a significant reduction in the price of video cards:""We believe that concerns about the fall in demand for GPU for the production of ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, as well as the significance and impact of these processes on the company's viability, are greatly exaggerated, and Nvidia will most likely be able to overcome these"" hard ""times by focusing on its other directions.”As of current, despite the significant drop in the price of major cryptocurrencies, the demand for cryptocurrency mining remains relatively high as seen in the rise in the hash rate of the Bitcoin network and the expansion of Samsung, GMO, and Bitmain’s operations, which activity wasn’t affected by grown shipments tariffs and regulations.The last quarter of 2018, and 2019 may see the continuation of Initial Public Offerings (IPOs), which one by one have been announced by Canaan Creative, Ebang Communication, Bitmain, and Bitfury this year.The estimated amount of $20 billion these company are expected to raise at IPO stages in total, and the values of $14 billion and $80 million Bitmain and Bitfury have already reached during their initial funding rounds, suggest that ASIC miners producers may have an alternative way of monetization even in case of decreasing sales."

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.","Market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.Does a crash in prices indicate the decaying fundamentals of an asset class? In many instances it does, but the market usually gets the fundamentals of an emerging technology wrong, both in the short term and in the long term.In May 1997, Amazon’s share price was quoting at $18. Short-term expectations propelled it to $300 by December 1998 and from there it slumped to $6 per share after the dotcom bubble burst. At that point, the market was severely underestimating its potential and the non-believers were claiming victory. However, the model proved everyone wrong, and Amazon became the second company in the history to reach a market capitalization of $1 trillion.Blockchain entrepreneur and industry advisor, Vinny Lingham, said to Cointelegraph: “The climate can change once more companies with solid use cases emerge from their development cycles, gain traction and prove sound business value to make a difference.” Just because the prices have crashed, it doesn’t signal the end of an asset class.As the price action in the near-term is dictated by technicals, let’s look at the charts and forecast the probable price action.During a waterfall decline, support levels are not honored, making it difficult to predict the bottom. The pullbacks also usually last only for about 1–3 days. Bitcoin attempted a recovery on Nov.r 21 that failed at $4,799.74.Subsequently, the BTC/USD pair has resumed its downtrend, making a new low. Both the moving averages are sloping down and the RSI is deep in the oversold territory. This shows that the sellers are in command.The immediate support on the downside is $4,100, below which, the fall can extend to $3,500– $3,000.  Any recovery attempt will face stiff resistance at the downtrend line and $5,000. Though we want to use the current fall to buy, we believe that the traders should wait for a level to hold before initiating any long positions.  Ripple has broken down of the uptrend line, which shows that it is also being affected by negative sentiment. However, it remains well above its lows, which confirms its outperformance.The moving averages have started to turn down and the RSI has dipped below 40, which suggests that the supply is outpacing demand.The next support on the downside is $0.37185 and below that, $0.26913. The XRP/USD pair will point to a consolidation if the prices quickly scale above the uptrend line and the moving averages flatten out. For now, it is best to stay on the sidelines.Ethereum is not finding buyers at higher levels. The pullback stalled at $141.91, which shows a lack of buying support.Currently, the bears are attempting to extend the decline to the next support level at $110. Though anything is possible in the markets, we believe that the oversold levels on the RSI point to a probable pullback. We don not recommend trading on hope, hence, we shall wait for a new buy setup to form before suggesting any trade in it.On the upside, the ETH/USD pair will face a stiff hurdle at $167.32. The 20-day EMA is also close to this level, making it a critical resistance to cross for the bulls.Stellar is at a critical level. If the bears sustain prices below $0.184, it will be negative and can result in the start of a new down move. The lower levels to watch on the downside are $0.1547188 that is the intraday low of March 18 and $0.138565, which is the intraday low hit on Dec. 22 of last year.Conversely, if the bulls successfully defend the $0.184 level, the XLM/USD pair, might pull back to the 20-day EMA and above it to the downtrend line. We suggest traders wait for a new buy setup to form before entering any long positions.Though EOS has broken down of the critical support at $3.8723, it has not plunged. This shows some buying support at lower levels. The oversold reading on the RSI also points to a recovery attempt.If the bulls scale $3.8723, a move to the downtrend line and above it to $4.493 is probable. The 20-day EMA is also located close to this level, hence, $4.493 will act as a major roadblock.If the EOS/USD pair fails to rise above $3.8723, it can slump to $3. We do not find any bullish patterns developing, hence, we are not proposing a trade in it.The bulls have been attempting to hold the support at $32 for the past three days, but have not been able to push Litecoin higher.Still, the oversold levels on the RSI point to a probable pullback. On the upside, the LTC/USD pair will face stiff resistance at the 20-day EMA and above that at the $47.246–$49.466 zone.On the other hand, if the bears sink prices below the support zone of $32–$29.653, the fall can extend to the next support at $20.The pullback in Cardano could not scale the $0.05 level and the price is back at the support of $0.041.If the ADA/USD pair breaks down and sustains below $0.041, it can slide to the next lower target of $0.025954.On the other hand, if the bulls succeed in rebounding from close to current levels, the digital currency will again attempt to break out of $0.05. If successful, the pullback can extend to $0.060105, which is likely to act a major resistance because this is the previous support and the 20-day EMA is also close to this level.Though the bulls attempted a pullback in Monero on Nov. 21 and 22, they could not push prices above $72. As a result, the price turned down once again.In this down leg, if the XMR/USD pair plunges below $60, the fall can extend to the next support at $46.If the virtual currency finds buyers at the current levels, the bulls will again attempt to break out of the $72 level. If this level is crossed, the pullback can continue to next overhead resistance of $81.TRON could not scale above the previous support-turned-resistance of $0.01587681 in the past two days. However, a small positive is that the bulls have held prices above the Nov. 20 intraday low of $0.0122194.We anticipate the bulls to make another attempt to climb above $0.01587681 and reach the next resistance of $0.0183.However, contrary to our expectation, if the TRX/USD pair plummets below $0.0122194, the fall can extend to the next lower level of $0.00844479.Dash continues to trade near the support of the descending channel. This shows that sellers have the upper hand.Any breakdown of the channel will be a negative development that can push the DASH/USD pair down to the next support at $75.If the support of the channel holds, the bulls will attempt another pullback to scale $120 levels and reach the next overhead resistance of $129.58. We believe that the traders should wait for a trend reversal before initiating any long positions.Market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. Charts for analysis are provided by TradingView."

The case concerns an alleged reversal of crypto transactions in the spring of 2017.","In a legal battle at the Singapore International Commercial Court, B2C2 alleges Quoine reversed seven Bitcoin to Ethereum (ETH) trades it attempted to perform in April 2017.The reversal, which Quoine in court documents said was due to a technical glitch, involves a total of 3,085 BTC (today around $13.7 million), which B2C2 is now attempting to extract from the exchange.The market maker says the decision was made without its permission or knowledge.The Straits Times quotes the documents as saying that “it is B2C2's contention that in the face of serious risk of itself having to bear the financial loss arising from the trades”:“Quoine chose the most advantageous course to mitigate such risk — by simply reversing the 'irreversible' trades and deducting the […] proceeds from the account.”The exact nature of the trades is unusual, according to Quoine. As a result of liquidity problems resulting from the glitch, B2C2 was able to set up trades at an “absurd” exchange rate of 10 BTC to 1 ETH, Quoine argues, continuing:“There is no other way than to describe these orders as abnormally and absurdly priced orders, given that they were about 250 times higher than the average price at which (the two currencies) then traded on the platform.”The Straits Times notes that the trial should end in one week’s time.Courts in various jurisdictions have sporadically dealt with cryptocurrency battles this year, in each instance adopting a case-by-case approach to the often unlegislated phenomenon.In September, China’s Supreme Court ruled that blockchain-based evidence was suitable for use in legal proceedings. Also in September, a New York federal judge ruled that U.S securities laws are applicable in regards to a case involving alleged crypto investor fraud."

The news outlet has reported that the miners are being sold “by kilo,” citing a post made by the founder of F2Pool on the Weibo microblogging platform.Crypto miners are reportedly especially eager to sell the older models, including Antminer S7, Antminer T9, and Avalon A741, as these have reached their “shutdown price.” According to local Chinese outlet Tencent News, the earnings from mining are no longer enough to cover electric power and other associated costs.The market slump has reportedly affected mostly small and medium-sized mining operations in the Chinese regions of Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia. There, 8BTC reports, some mining machines are being sold on the second-hand market for merely 5 percent of their original value. A mining machine bought at a price of up to 20,000 yuan ($2,885) a year ago is reportedly currently sold for just 1,000 yuan ($144).Bitcoin’s price has kept falling, along with the rest of the crypto market, since the hard fork network upgrade of Bitcoin Cash (BCH) that took place Nov. 15. The update has led cryptocurrency exchanges around the world to suspend BCH trading and withdrawals.Earlier this month, Bitcoin mining giant Bitmain announced plans to reach out to local mining farms in the coal-rich province of Xinjiang, and deploy around 90,000 Antminer S9 devices in the region. Bitmain’s move is reported to be a strategic one in the computing “power war” associated with the BCH hard fork.At press time, the crypto markets have calmed down, with most of the top ten cryptocurrencies seeing only mild losses. BTC has today hovered between $4,450 and $4,630.In September, the CEO of F2Pool published an infographic that indicated that if Bitcoin price would reach lower than 36,792 Chinese yuan (about $5,376), mining the cryptocurrency with an Antminer T9 would become unprofitable. In the case of an S7 model miner, the break-even point amounted to a significantly higher Bitcoin price point of about 79,258 yuan (about $11,581)."

and stole dozens of Bitcoins, though the exact amount wasn't revealed.","Nov 28, 2018","The cryptocurrency wallets made by Trezor have long been considered a standard of the industry and have been trusted as a reliable cold storage of cryptocurrencies by large media, blockchain developers and crypto enthusiasts worldwide. The company prides itself on the quality of its product and in being one of the leaders in the market of hardware wallets.","But it was only a matter of time before the Trezor’s flagship device got the attention of fraudsters. On Nov. 19, the company issued an official warning to users which reported that an almost identical copy of Trezor One was spotted in the market:[PSA] In recent weeks we have discovered a non-genuine Trezor One devices which try to imitate the original to the bone.For more information on how to spot a fake Trezor One device, please read our latest blog post here: https://t.co/tpe21iTVXmAn announcement published on Trezor’s official blog begins with this proverb. Though the company’s officials acknowledged that “Trezor clones have been released over the years,” a “fake Trezor device, manufactured by a different, unknown vendor” has become a “startling” discovery for them.SatoshiLabs, a manufacturer devteam, has made considerable attempts to assure the community that the fake devices are not identical in any way to the original and have significant difference in both content and functioning capability. As explained in the “how to distinguish” guidelines in the same blog post, the real Trezor One device bears a different name and is manufactured by legitimate companies, while the fake device replicates the original’s outward appearance to fool potential buyers.SatoshiLabs has also stated that the fake devices could be immediately spotted by their packaging, which differs from the legitimate device by the design of the special holographic markings and the presence of unsightly ‘Made in China’ markings. Though imitation may be “the sincerest form of flattery,” it is likely that the minor similarities between the devices end on outward appearances and do not extend to the software, which may well be faulty or even full of malware, in the case of the fakes.Those customers, who are used to buying electronic devices on such platforms as Amazon or eBay, could have been confronted with an offer to purchase a “used just once” or “opened but never used” Trezor One wallet. The price for such an item may vary from $39 to $49.Trezor has encountered situations of this nature before, though not the blatant copying of its product. The company has always emphasized that its software is the “most secure” and is invulnerable to hacking attacks.These claims were questioned when, in mid-August 2017, a group of hackers managed to crack Trezor wallets using relatively simple methods, allowing for the theft or identification of private keys from those devices. After an investigation into the incident, Trezor stated that the seed for the hacked wallet’s private key was saved on a flash memory card and relocated to the afflicted device’s random access memory (RAM) during its use. It was later identified that only Trezor wallets were affected by the vulnerability. In response to the incident, Trezor released the firmware security update version 1.5.2 on Aug. 16 and later claimed that users were safe and had nothing to fear.The attacks were not limited to Trezor, as other devices have been also affected by bugs and bad actors. A report published by SpectreAttack in early January 2018 revealed two bugs, known as Meltdown and Spectre, which were said to exploit security vulnerabilities in Intel, AMD and ARM processors of any device they are installed in. The list of devices included PCs, laptops, tablets and smartphones.The Meltdown bug afflicted Intel chips that were estimated to be installed in about 90 percent of all computers worldwide. The Spectre bug affected Intel, ARM and AMD chips on any device and both types of malware were reported to be capable of operating in cloud storage environments.The Ledger Nano S, another popular hardware wallet, has also been found to be lacking in terms of security. On Feb. 5, 2017, it was discovered that users were open to attacks when connecting their Ledger Nano S to a device compromised by a hacker and using it to transfer funds between accounts on a regular basis. The fraudster could easily replicate the account addresses and gain access to the funds stored therein.In January 2017, the participants of various Bitcoin and blockchain-related conferences were given fake Bitcoin hardware wallets imitating the legitimate products of Trezor and Ledger. Such ruses were aimed at stealing the funds that would be placed on the devices.Earlier, in December 2016, a hacker managed to fake the identity of a user and transferred their phone number from T-Mobile to a carrier called Bandwidth, which was linked to a Google Voice account used by the attacker. The hacker then reset all the victim’s passwords and stole dozens of Bitcoins, though the exact amount wasn’t revealed.There are numerous vulnerabilities that hackers can exploit to steal hard-earned cryptocurrencies. Notably, software companies are unaware of a large number of tricks that the hackers have up their sleeves, while the latter are developing ever more devious and elaborate schemes to phish out cryptos from their unsuspecting victims.In his blog, Karl Kreder, Ph.D. — the co-founder of wallet manufacturer Grid+ — outlines six vulnerabilities based on his personal and professional observations, which could potentially lead to hardware wallets being compromised or hacked.Man-in-the-Middle (MIM) AttackAs observed by Kreder, MIM attacks can affect some cold storage devices, whose screens display eight digits of the recipient address when a user sends the funds. According to the calculations he made in August 2017, hacking into such a device could be implemented for “a relatively small economic cost” (about $800) with the use of the address generators like vante.me.Wallets like Ledger and Trezor can be vulnerable when being upgraded via a USB port. This option is often allowed by a manufacturer with the help of so-called USB Device Firmware Upgrade (DFU). As reported, the market has already seen successful attempts to use DFU to remotely dump the memory of the STM32F family of microcontrollers.This could lead to a number of negative consequences for a cold storage device owner, starting with the theft of private keys and ending with a malicious actor re-flashing the wallet with malicious code during an upgrade.As a rule, in case the hardware device is lost or falls into the hands of a bad actor, manufacturers like Trezor and the Ledger reset the wallet if a wrong pin is entered three times. This prevents a fraudster from getting control of the wallet and using a brute-force-based attack to compromise a pin.During the Defcon conference, the Cryptotronix developers demonstrated that the Trezor STM32F205 could be glitched by using both Vcc and clock glitching attacks. As a result, the device becomes vulnerable and private keys can be obtained by a third party without needing to know the pin.This is the sort of vulnerability being faced by Trezor One owners who bought fake copies. Originally, a Trezor hardware device is protected with branded holographic stickers and super glue which holds the housing together. This is supposed to protect the wallet from being tampered with after it was sent by the manufacturer to a customer. However, if the device falls into a fraudster’s hands, the latter can flash a malicious version of the software or re-insert the key. Once this is done, the device’s body is sealed with a similar holographic sticker and glue.The author considers a recovery phrase to be “the most vulnerable piece of the security puzzle,” since this 12–24 word series string usually consists of plain text and is often stored “in a sock drawer at one point.”As warned by Edward Snowden, PINs and passwords can be obtained by a spying fraudster spying via an ordinary desktop or smartphone web camera. Cryptocurrencies holders and traders may not be an exception.The community responded to the news about faked Trezor One devices with a mix of outrage and frustration peppered by some understanding. Some pointed to the pathetic security measures taken by Trezor in relying on a holographic sticker as a safety barrier. Others confirmed they bought fake Trezor wallets.I can confirm. I bought 2 on Amazon several months ago, and they have the wrong holographic seal. Never opened them. pic.twitter.com/Emq8ugxIMoMany responsible users commented with calls for vigilance and additional security measures, while opinion leaders remained sided with the legitimate manufacturer. Naturally, a flurry of recommendations and comments ensued as users offered various tips on how to keep their wallets safe — with suggestions ranging from keeping the wallets under a mattress with a shotgun nearby to leaving the crypto market for good.The faking of devices occupying a market worth about $95 million in 2017 alone was only a matter of time, as it was predicted earlier by some crypto enthusiasts.Though the fake software may not be suitable for crypto storage in the first place, the price difference may be enough to lure unsuspecting users and lead to woe and losses of their funds. Given the fact that today, the majority of cryptocurrencies are held in cold storage, and 97 percent of exchanges prefer to keep the funds this way, the forgery of devices for crypto storage may still remain attractive for fraudsters, according to a study issued by the University of Cambridge.The experts and the manufacturer itself recommend maintaining vigilance when selecting hardware wallets and to purchase them only from verified resellers that can be found in a list on the official Trezor website.Hello Rahul, the main differences are the hologram and barcode on the back of the box. The fake Trezor could be using our firmware, so it is best not to use it. The safest is to buy Trezor from our official shop or resellers.Apart from the main warning given here and there by Trezor - “If you don't own your private keys, you don't own your coins” — some experts advise having two cold wallets and not to keep all the funds in one place to diversify the risks.Companies, in their turn, should use their leverage to attempt to stop the imitation of their products through legal channels and to implement additional security measures after extensive analysis of the fake devices, as the community believes."

The top result on Google search leads to urbandictionary.com, which defines “nour” as the following:“The most loving, affectionate and caring person you'll ever meet. Extremely smart, funny and sensitive. A bit lost, still figuring out what she wants in life and how to reach it. Stubborn and not willing to take other peoples advice. When she smiles she makes you forget all the problems you have, her hug will give you an assurance that you have never felt and will never do.”Another possibility is that “nour” is a transliteration of Arabic “نور” for “light,” also used to mean “light” or “fire” in ancient Hebrew (“נור,” “nour”) and Aramaic (“,נורא” “noura”): the latter is used in the “Haggadah,” the text used to set the order of the ritual for the Jewish festival of Passover.Alongside the cryptic four-letters, the account also befriended a user named Wagner Tamanaha, whose profile indicates he is based in São Paulo, Brazil. Tamanaha has acknowledged the “befriending,” tweeting today in Portuguese, “Parece que o Satoshi reapareceu e estou sendo investigado :-) [“Looks like Satoshi's reappeared and I'm being investigated :-)”].Publicly-shared posts on Tamanaha’s Facebook page suggest he is currently active in the Brazilian blockchain and crypto community, and his blogspot profile contains a post titled “Social networks with crypto media Steemit, coming together in the blockchain revolution,” dated November  2016.Nakamoto’s abrupt disappearance in late 2010 spawned a legend almost as famous as the cryptocurrency he, she, or they invented on Oct. 31 2008 with the publication of the Bitcoin white paper. The inventor’s first “name,” Satoshi, has also been used to christen one hundred millionth of one Bitcoin — the smallest, indivisible unit of the cryptocurrency.Controversially self-proclaimed “Nakamoto” Craig Wright has recently been in the crypto limelight in connection with the fallout of the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) hard fork in mid-November, which led to Wright’s preferred protocol spinning off into the newly-forked Bitcoin SV (BSV) token. (A hard fork of a hard fork, as Bitcoin Cash was itself forked from the original Bitcoin).Bitcoin pioneer Jeff Garzik, reportedly the “third-biggest contributor” to Bitcoin’s code and one of Nakamoto's key collaborators, has recently ventured his “personal theory” that the coder Floridian Dave Kleiman is the much-mythologized figure behind the coin."

bought some through an ETN based on a Swedish exchange.” According ...","Dec 3, 2018","On Nov. 16, Switzerland’s primary stock exchange, SIX Swiss Exchange, announced that it will list the world’s first multi-crypto-based exchange-traded product (ETP).","Exchange-traded products (ETP) are derivatively priced securities that are traded on a national securities exchange. Their pricing derives its value from other investment instruments, most commonly found in the form of commodities, stocks and indexes.The first global multi-crypto ETP has the backing of Swiss startup Amun AG and will be listed under the ticker symbol HOLD. According to the announcement, the ETP will track five of the sector's biggest cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin (BTC), Ripple (XRP), Ethereum (ETH), Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Litecoin (LTC).The announcement also reveals that each of the five cryptocurrencies will obtain a degree of the market share within the ETP, although Bitcoin will reportedly make up roughly half of the ETP’s overall assets. XRP, the now second-biggest cryptocurrency, will make up 25.4 percent of the assets, followed by Ethereum with 16.7, Bitcoin Cash at 5.2 percent and Litecoin with 3 percent.In spite of many hopeful product launches across the crypto sector attempting to hasten mainstream adoption, regulation issues remain a serious and consistent barrier to progress. Hany Rashwan, co-founder and chief executive of Amun AG, has not overlooked this potential sticking point and maintains that the product will comply with the existing strict policies that apply to all other ETPs.Amun’s official website states that SIX Swiss Exchange is Europe’s fourth-largest exchange and has a market capitalization of $1.6 trillion.The listing of the multi-crypto based exchange is not Europe’s first experiment with crypto ETPs. Swedish company XBT Provider has been running the lucrative CoinShares exchange-traded product since 2015. This listing is the latest crypto development in Sweden, a state well known for its open-minded approach to innovation in the fintech sector, as well as a country predicted to become the first “cashless economy.”Coinshares has two Bitcoin trackers: XBT Bitcoin Tracker One (COINXBT) and XBT Bitcoin Tracker Euro (COINXBE). As previously reported by Cointelegraph, the two trackers trade in both euros and Swedish krona.The product ascribes 200 shares as equal to the price of one Bitcoin for trading in Swedish krona and 20 shares to one Bitcoin for the euro version. The product is accessible to investors from across Europe and has attracted over $1 billion since its 2015 listing on Nasdaq Stockholm, leading developers to launch additional versions in neighboring Denmark, Latvia, Finland and Estonia.Coinshares caught the eye of billionaire crypto investor Mark Cuban early on. Speaking at the Vanity Fair New Establishment Summit in Los Angeles, Cuban commented on the investing experience and the ascription of asset value:“It is interesting because there are a lot of assets which their value is just based on supply and demand. [With] most stocks, there is no intrinsic value, because you have no true ownership rights and no voting rights. You just have the ability to buy and sell those stocks. Bitcoin is the same thing. Its value is based on supply-demand. I have bought some through an ETN based on a Swedish exchange.”According to Bloomberg, COINXBE has total assets of 96.5 million euros and COINXBT has total assets of 986.3 million Swedish krona.Perhaps the most established exchange-trading method in the crypto world is that of exchange-traded funds (ETF).An ETF tracks a commodity, bonds, a stock index or one or several assets. Single-asset ETFs are now commonplace and can be used to trade a variety of assets, such as gold. As ETFs are already a major tool for passive investment in mainstream finance, many players in the crypto community hope that ETFs will pave the way toward widespread adoption.  Part of the allure of ETFs that track a basket of assets is that, by their very nature, they are less prone to the risk of fluctuations that other investment instruments are vulnerable to. Because the value of the investment is spread across multiple assets, losses from underperforming assets are counterbalanced by those that more rapidly accrue value. As a result of this, ETFs enjoy popularity among low-risk investors.A Bitcoin ETF tracks Bitcoin as the underlying asset. This results in the investor only holding the security of the Bitcoin without actually owning the coins themselves. So far, Bitcoin ETF applications to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have not been successful. Billionaire twins and major crypto players Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss have had two high-profile applications denied by the SEC so far, the most recent being rejected in July. The rejection was accompanied by a 92-page report on the application that disagreed with the the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust’s claim that Bitcoin markets are “inherently resistant to manipulation.” In the report, the SEC honed in on this point in particular:“The arguments submitted in support of this claim are incomplete and inconsistent, and are unsupported or contradicted by data.”In spite of the repeated setbacks for the Winklevoss twins’ ill-fated applications, the seemingly hardline approach of the SEC has not prevented further applications from being made throughout the year.Earlier this year, investment management firm VanEck and the blockchain technology company SolidX, applied for a physically-backed Bitcoin ETF to be listed on the Chicago Board Options Exchange’s BZX Equities Exchange. The proposal would see each share in the ETF valued at around $200,000, in an attempt to lure in institutional investors.This tactic could prove to pay off for the two companies, considering Morgan Stanley’s October report that documented Bitcoin’s new potential for mainstream institutional investment. Furthermore, the fact that the ETF is backed by derivatives means that the firms in question will actually hold BTC as opposed to their corresponding value, a factor which may well be important in influencing the way the regulatory decision will fall for the application.As the SEC decided to postpone their decision in August, the two companies have yet to receive an official reply. Given that, as of Aug. 22, a total of nine Bitcoin ETF applications from three separate applicants have been rejected outright, the drawn out nature of the SEC’s decision making, along with the huge potential for crossing over into the financial mainstream that it brings, the outcome is eagerly awaited by the crypto community. The SEC did, however, publish a memorandum from a meeting about the proposal in October.The memorandum outlines the past relationship between the two companies and the regulator, taking into account their most recent, ongoing project and the failed SolidX bid for an ETF to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in March 2017. Also mentioned in the memorandum is the SEC’s reasoning behind the nine previously rejected applications. Two of the applications were made by ProShares, a further five were submitted by Direxion and two by GraniteShares. The SEC took umbrage at the notion that the Bitcoin futures market had “significant” demand and voiced concern at the possibility of “fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices”:“[...] the Exchange has offered no record evidence to demonstrate that Bitcoin futures markets are ‘markets of significant size.’ That failure is critical because [...] the Exchange has failed to establish that other means to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices will be sufficient, and therefore surveillance-sharing with a regulated market of significant size related to Bitcoin is necessary.”The memorandum also documents how VanEck, SolidX and the representatives of the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), vehemently disagreed with the regulators on this issue, adding that their choice of the word “significant” was deliberately imprecise and enabled them to manipulate agreements between the involved parties:“As issuers, we are concerned the SEC staff have created a moving target in their use of the word ‘significant.’ The Staff have never provided guidance as to what ‘significant’ means, enabling them to move the goal post indefinitely.”In spite of the tough stance the SEC has taken against the previous applications, Commissioner Hester M. Peirce announced that the regulator would once again review them in the future. In a publication that broke from the official standing of the SEC regarding Bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general, Commissioner Peirce claimed that the regulator had overstepped its “limited role” in focusing on the market itself as opposed to the derivative in question:“The Commission erroneously reads […] the [Securities Exchange] Act, which requires […] that the rules of a national securities exchange be ‘designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices…’ [It] focuses its decision not on the ETP shares to be listed […] but on the underlying Bitcoin spot market […] [instead of] the ability of BZX […] to surveil trading of and to deter manipulation in the ETP shares listed and traded on BZX.”On Oct. 4, the SEC announced that, “by Nov. 5, 2018, any party or other person may file a statement in support of, or in opposition to, the action made pursuant to the delegated authority.”The latest proposal from SolidX, VanEck and the CBOE is reported to remain under review by the regulator until February 2019.SolidX, VanEck and the CBOE are not the only ones who predict a more open-minded approach to Bitcoin ETFs. CNBC crypto analyst Brian Kelly believes that Chicago Mercantile Exchange statistics indicate a growing trend toward the derivatives marketplace and a rapidly evolving futures market. Kelly said that this is likely to improve the environment for SEC Bitcoin ETF approvals as early as next year:“Here’s CME Futures open interest of large holders. [As of] April, you’re starting to see a big increase […] about an 85 percent growth rate. If you extrapolate that out, by February 2019, you’re going to have a very robust market here.”Not all crypto players, however, share the same bullish approach. Tech entrepreneur, Andreas Antonopoulous, said that, although he expects the SEC to approve Bitcoin ETFs, he does not expect them to benefit the crypto industry in the long term:""I’m going to burst your bubble. I know a lot of people really want to see an ETF happen because 'to the moon, and lambos,' but I think it is a terrible idea. I still think it is going to happen, I just think it is a terrible idea. I’m actually against ETFs. I think a Bitcoin ETF is going to be damaging to the ecosystem.""On Nov. 20, the U.K.’s financial regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) announced in a speech that it is considering a ban on cryptocurrency derivatives. The regulator stated that this latest announcement was part of its intention to create its “most comprehensive” response to the industry.Speaking at the “Regulation of Cryptocurrencies” event in London, the FCA executive director of strategy and competition, Christopher Woolard, emphasized that the organization was looking into outlawing derivatives. The ban would also likely include options, futures and transferable securities. Woolard elaborated on how the FCA is concerned about consumer welfare, as well as other issues across the market:“We’re concerned that retail consumers are being sold complex, volatile and often leveraged derivatives products based on exchange tokens with underlying market integrity issues.”From the mixed bag of comments from crypto players, what appears to be gaining traction is the notion that crypto exchange-traded products are likely to make their entrance into the sector regardless of whether they will actually enrich the cryptocurrency sphere or not. In spite of the progress being made to implement these investment instruments in both Sweden and Switzerland, the real litmus test will be the regulatory decision from the SEC.Commissioner Peirce’s harsh insider critique of the regulatory body’s past behavior — along with the announcement that the past nine rejections will be re-examined — could signal that fortunes are finally set to change for crypto exchange-traded products in the United States.As the U.K. works through its latest regulatory quandary, other players maintain that there is a market appetite for Bitcoin ETFs and it is only a matter of time before they are made available."

The analysis was performed by researchers Jiahua Xu and Benjamin Livshits at Imperial College London.","A pump and dump scheme is a form of securities fraud that has also become common in the cryptocurrency space. The organizers of the scheme choose a coin, boost its price and then “dump” sell their overvalued currency, which further leads to the price falls and losses among the investors.While cryptocurrency markets are currently in a rut, with some coins reaching new lows in the month of November, daily trade volume is currently $14.2 billion, according to CoinMarketCap. The pump and dump volume cited in the study only accounts for 0.049 percent of total 24-hour trade volume.In the course of their research, the analysts reportedly focused on a pump and dump scam with a coin called BVB, that happened on Nov. 14, 2018. They collected details by following announcements on several Telegram channels, including Official McAfee Pump Signals, and recorded the price changes and trading volumes of the selected coin.McAfee Pump Signals reportedly revealed BVB, which had been dormant for over a year by that time, with little trading activity and a value of about 35 satoshi ($0.00132202). 1 satoshi is equal to one hundred millionth of Bitcoin (BTC).The first buy order was placed and completed within one second after the first announcement, according to Xu and Livshits. The coin’s price reportedly surged to its peak after just 18 seconds, reaching 115 satoshi ($0.00434378).It took the participants “three and half minutes after the start of the pump and dump” to take their profits, after which “the coin price had dropped below its open price,” the researchers said. The analysis revealed that those who joined the activity more than 18 seconds after its beginning could hardly make any profit.Additionally, Xu and Livshits investigated 236 other pump and dump scams that were performed between July 21 and Nov. 18, concluding that “many of them were preceded by unusual buying activity in the target currency.” The researchers stated:“The study reveals that pump and dump organizers can easily use their insider information to take extra gain at the sacrifice of fellow pumpers.”The researchers suggests that it is possible to spot target currencies before they are revealed by looking for unexpected trades in shadowy coins. Xu and Livshits appealed to the historical data from known pump and dump schemes to train a machine learning algorithm to trace telltale signs that a scam will soon occur.In August, the Wall Street Journal claimed in a study that cryptocurrency price manipulation was largely conducted by organized “trading groups” using services such as Telegram. The WSJ suggested that coordinated “pump and dump” schemes had seen traders inflate and crash the prices of various cryptocurrencies this year."

The idea of a ban on crypto derivatives first surfaced in October, Cointelegraph reported.The group had delineated cryptocurrencies into three types, Woolard noted, constituting “exchange tokens” such as Bitcoin (BTC), “security tokens,” and “utility tokens.”Regarding unauthorized use of tokens, Woolard additionally announced plans to take on what he called “one of the most comprehensive responses globally to the use of cryptoassets for illicit activities.”A recent survey meanwhile showed that knowledge, ownership, and awareness of Bitcoin among British consumers has markedly increased."

He stressed:“The desire to have a non-sovereign form of currency has existed forever. Remember, [Bitcoin] came out of the depths of the [2008] financial crisis, let’s see what happens next year. Let’s see if central banks in the U.S. and Europe can unwind this thing successfully and then see what people want to own.”Analyzing the recent market tumble, Smith suggested that the crypto space still lacks the capital to “absorb” abrupt sell-offs — such as the one recently sparked by the contentious Bitcoin Cash (BCH) hard fork last week (a conflict Smith called “juvenile”). He noted that:“The on-ramps for new capital is very difficult [...] if you’re a global institution, it’s still very difficult for you to buy Bitcoin in the way you’d like [...] [for example] at Fidelity, or Bank of America.”Without new capital on-ramp, he continued to argue, the resultant low liquidity, low volumes, and low volatility — just as the crypto space saw at the end of this October — creates an environment that is not resilient enough to absorb temporarily shaken confidence or shifts in investor sentiment.Smith noted that Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto designed the supply of his non-sovereign, decentralized, peer-to-peer currency to finish only in the year 2140 — and this is the appropriate long-term vision and scope of Bitcoin as an invention.This week, Wall Street crypto bull Tom Lee has similarly emphasized the crucial role of institutional participation in the industry, highlighting the forthcoming launch of the digital assets platform Bakkt by New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) operator Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) as a watershed moment.As Susquehanna’s Smith alluded, U.S. investment firm Fidelity, which administers over $7.2 trillion in client assets, has also announced the launch of its own cryptocurrency business that it says will provide a “secure, compliant, and institutional-grade omnibus storage solution for bitcoin, ether and other digital assets.”"

Users can also see the total value of their current portfolio, and set price and percentage value change alerts for their chosen coins.Further functionality includes a “recurring buy” feature, as well as support for a newly-launched investment vehicle dubbed “The Cryptoverse” –– a basket of cryptocurrencies, weighted by market capitalization, to be bought as a single order.In an interview with Bloomberg published today, the twins struck a bullish tone in regard to the recent crypto market slump, Tyler stating “we’re totally at home in winter,” and his twin Cameron adding that “it gives us time to build internally, and refine and kind of catch our breath.”Cameron contextualized the new app as a bid to reach out to retail investors, telling Bloomberg that:“A lot of our decisions have perhaps given off a perception that we’re more institutional-based. The reality of the situation is that we have a diverse customer base. And the retail story is just beginning.”The twins also revealed their 2019 goal of expanding to the Asian crypto market, where they will face stiff competition from a thriving exchange industry that includes the likes of Bitfinex, Binance and Huobi. Gemini’s expansion plans have also been rumored to include possible entry to the United Kingdom market, as reported this September.The twins, stalwarts of the crypto space, have had a checkered history with regulators. Successes include a recent seal of approval from the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) to launch their own U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin, the Gemini dollar.Gemini also obtained insurance coverage for custodied digital assets from lending services firm Aon, which will complement Gemini’s already available Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) coverage for U.S. dollar deposits (in place under the New York State BitLicense framework since 2015).The twins nonetheless faced a high-profile setback this July, when their application to launch a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) received its second rejection from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).Most recently, the twins have made crypto news with a lawsuit they filed against Bitcoin Foundation founder Charlie Shrem concerning an alleged Bitcoin theft dating back six years.As of press time, Gemini is ranked 51st among crypto exchanges in terms of adjusted trade volumes, seeing around $16.5 million in daily trades."

Mandel has made it possible for businesses to pay taxes using Bitcoin.","Nov 29, 2018","In what is being hailed as a first in America, Ohio’s State Treasurer Josh Mandel has made it possible for businesses to pay taxes using Bitcoin.","In the coming weeks, business owners in the state will be able to register and settle their tax liabilities online, with payments to be processes by cryptocurrency payment service provider BitPay.Businesses will be able to pay 23 different taxes using BTC through an online portal that has been set up by the state treasury office. As it stands, individuals will not be able to use the service to pay private taxes.The Ohio Treasurer has made it clear that it will not actually hold any Bitcoin. The cryptocurrency will be immediately converted to U.S. Dollars after payments have been made to BitPay. Businesses of any size will be able to make use of the payment service.The Ohio Treasurer has stated that the move is one to provide more options for state businesses and residents to interact with the state government.Mandel has been somewhat of a pioneer in leveraging emerging technologies into state systems and offerings. In 2014, he launched OhioCheckbook.com, which put all of the Ohio state government spending information online and accessible to the public.The move saw the state rated number one for government transparency, according to research from the U.S. Public Interest Research Group.This latest move is in the hopes of making the state a leader in blockchain technology development and adoption, as Mandel told Cointelegraph in an interview this week. Firstly, the state wants to offer taxpayers more options when paying taxes:“Secondly, to project to the rest of the country and the world that the state of Ohio is a leader in blockchain technology. I believe if we’re going to grow our technology economy here in Ohio, we have to first be a leader in technology.”Mandel added that he had been a crypto enthusiast for a few years and that this is just part of a process of inspiring wider adoption of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology around the country:“Here in the United States, states are the laboratories for democracy, and I think this is a perfect illustration of this concept — where this idea is beginning at a state level in Ohio, but the ultimate goal is to inspire the federal government to follow suit.”Mandel’s term as Ohio Treasurer is set to end in January 2019, but he remains confident that the move will continue to operate once he leaves his post.It has been reported that Mandel has discussed this with his elected successor, Republican Representative Robert Sprague, and Mandel confirmed to Cointelegraph that they’d discussed the matter:“I’ve spoken with him about it, he and I are friends and allies, and I am confident that it will continue.”Having launched just this week, phase one only allows businesses in Ohio to be able to pay taxes using cryptocurrency. But as Mandel explains, this is just the first step of some ambitious plans to accept different cryptocurrencies and offer the service to individual taxpayers.“In the next phase of Ohiocrypto.com, we hope to expand the initiative to allow individuals to pay their taxes in cryptocurrency and expand beyond Bitcoin to include other cryptocurrencies.”Given the infancy of the project, Mandel was reluctant to speculate on a given timeframe for the role out of further improvements.“As with any initiative that is brand new and has never been done in America, it’s important that we take it slow and be prudent and thoughtful. We’re going to take the process slowly, and develop and expand it on what we believe to be a prudent timeline.”Mandel also explained that the decision to convert Bitcoin straight to fiat currency was taken after extensive research by his team.“When you’re dealing with taxpayers’ money, the variables that are most important are safety and security of the tax money. Every decision we make in the Ohio Treasury office is driven by this.”BitPay CEO Stephen Paire told Cointelegraph that the initiative is an important one for blockchain-based and cryptocurrency-focused businesses that could make effective use of the payment option:“One of the things we do is talk to all the different companies in the blockchain and cryptocurrency industry and find out who their vendors are. We then talk to them and get them signed up with BitPay, and that enables companies in our industry to be able to pay their bills with the technology they’re building the infrastructure for. Obviously, all these companies have to pay taxes, so it just makes a lot of sense for all those companies to have the ability to pay their taxes with cryptocurrency.”Ohio is the first state in America to actually launch this new method of payment, but it is not the first to have tried.Other U.S. states have tried to pass bills that would allow taxes to be paid using cryptocurrency. However, these bills have been stopped in their tracks by state lawmakers.In May 2018, Arizona’s House of Representatives passed a bill that would enable citizens to pay taxes using cryptocurrency. Despite that fact, the bill has yet to come into effect due to amendments in the fine print.The revision called for a study into the possibility of these alternative payment forms, but it has not been made clear when this will be carried out.Similarly, Georgia looked to pass a bill in February that would allow cryptocurrencies to be used as a payment option for state taxes and licenses. However, the bill “died in committee,” according to a progress update on Legiscan. Illinois is also in the process of considering a similar bill.Despite these failures, other U.S. states have passed various bills that have helped the adoption cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology which bodes well for the future of adoption.Wyoming was able to pass a number of bills that saw cryptocurrencies classified as a new asset class in the state in March 2018.The move does have some interesting implications for businesses that will look to take advantage of the new payment method.A number of countries around the world have enforced taxes on cryptocurrency gains and this will be something to consider for those entities that will pay their taxes using Bitcoin.As international tax attorney Selva Ozelli pointed out to Cointelegraph, businesses will have to grapple with additional processes when holding and using cryptocurrencies:“Businesses will need to keep track of the basis, holding period, price of cryptocurrencies; they will need to learn how to hedge the price swings between USD and cryptocurrencies; they will need to comply with FinCEN money laundering and additional laws. They will have increased record keeping requirements and more sophisticated treasury functions — just like multinational companies. On the other hand, these enhanced compliance requirements will encourage blockchain companies to design systems to simplify such functions for businesses going forward and fuel growth in blockchain technology-related jobs.”Dr. Niklas Schmidt, a partner at the law firm Wolf Theiss, also made a similar observation, especially for businesses that have held onto their Bitcoin for some time:“Payment of taxes in cryptocurrency creates an interesting problem: If a taxpayer has purchased, say, Bitcoin some time ago and has an unrealized gain, in most jurisdictions, discharging a liability with such an appreciated asset will lead to a taxation of the gain. In other words, payment of your taxes in Bitcoin may again trigger tax.”Another factor to consider is that businesses in the state will still be liable to pay federal tax, which can only be done with fiat currency, according to Schmidt.This tax payment option is not entirely new, but considering the impact it may have in Ohio and America, it could potentially spread to more countries.While these moves may have failed in other American states, Ozelli believes that the success of such initiatives in other countries proves that there is an interest in this option being available.“In the U.S., other states around the country also considered accepting cryptocurrencies for taxes, but those initiatives in Arizona, Georgia and Illinois never got past state legislatures. The Swiss municipality of Chiasso allowed residents to pay their taxes in Bitcoin starting in January of 2018, while Seminole County, Florida, became the very first county in the U.S. to announce accepting Bitcoin to pay their taxes in May of 2018.”Schmidt also told Cointelegraph that Zug, a municipality in Switzerland, also accepts tax payments in Bitcoin. With more than a few places around the world actively offering this payment option, it does seem to bode well for this becoming more commonplace.Cryptocurrency investment advisor Anthony Pompliano made an astute observation in his daily newsletter, citing milestones like this as an important use-case example for cryptocurrency going forward:“Historically, Bitcoin detractors have said the digital asset couldn’t be a currency because you can’t pay your taxes with it. That is obviously no longer true now. This is another data point that supports the legitimization of the world’s most popular decentralized digital currency.”Governmental agencies and financial institutions are slowly seeing the value in incorporating cryptocurrencies into certain processes. Every step in this direction is a positive one, especially when the focus is on the current state of the markets.Mandel hopes that his work with the Treasury will play a part in influencing other states to follow in their footsteps and eventually take hold at a national level:“I hope what we’re doing in Ohio will inspire states around the country to allow their taxpayers to pay in cryptocurrency and ultimately inspire the federal government to pay federal taxes with crypto as well.”"

#Bitcoin ...","Nov 19, 2018",Netherlands-based ‘Big Four’ auditor KPMG released a bullish report on cryptocurrency Nov. 15. The report argues that institutional investors must join the industry for it to “realize its potential.”,"The report, dubbed ‘Institutionalization of Cryptoassets,’ focuses on why and how institutional investors should enter cryptocurrency, along with “challenges” the process faces and under what circumstances crypto could become a “full-fledged asset class.”“Cryptoassets have potential. But for them to realize this potential, institutionalization is needed,” the report’s authors argue, continuing:“Institutionalization is the at-scale participation in the crypto market of banks, broker dealers, exchanges, payment providers, fintechs, and other entities in the global financial services ecosystem. We believe this is a necessary next step for crypto to create trust and scale.”As Cointelegraph previously reported, KPMG has traditionally focused on risk management of blockchain technology, adopting a shrewd outlook on cryptocurrency in its early years, along with the other major auditors.The tone of the latest publication represents a slight pivot meanwhile, the company notably avoiding the ‘crypto-bashing’ narrative repeated this month by entities including the European Central Bank and Bank of International Settlements.For KPMG, crypto is a “big deal” and “worth paying attention to.”“[C]rypto continues to garner both good and bad press, and the debate between supporters and detractors is far from settled,” the report continues:“In 2018, we are seeing a wave of new entrants in the market such as security token platforms, stablecoins, and even established financial services institutions that are launching crypto products and services. Cryptoassets are now impossible to ignore.”Various other sources have also stood by their prediction that cryptocurrency’s fortunes will reverse upwards upon the entry of institutional investors, the start of which is scheduled for next month with the launch of the Intercontinental Exchange’s (ICE)  trading platform Bakkt.KPMG report’s release coincided with a sudden rapid decrease in the price of all major cryptocurrencies, in part as a result of uncertainty over the future of major crypto Bitcoin Cash, currently the fourth-largest crypto asset by market cap."

Both the DoJ and CFTC have reportedly declined to comment, and neither has either formally accused any party or entity of wrongdoing.Neither Bitfinex’s general counsel, nor legal representatives for the exchange and Tether, have reportedly responded to Bloomberg’s requests for comment either by press time.The DoJ’s allegedly intensified probe into activity on Bitfinex adds to prior investigations into possible misconduct; both Bitfinex and Tether received subpoenas from U.S. regulators for undisclosed reasons back in December 2017, which Bloomberg relates to insistent doubt over Tether’s claims that USDT is backed one-to-one by the U.S. dollar.Vocal Tether critics have gone so far as to accuse the firm of covering up an alleged fiat reserve deficit in complicity with Bitfinex; suspicion was further fanned by Tether’s controversial decision to dissolve its relationship with a third-party auditor this January. Tether has since released an unofficial audit in June to prove that its tokens are backed by the correct amount of fiat holdings.Further controversies were stoked this June when an academic paper co-authored by University of Texas professor John M. Griffin argued that “purchases with Tether are timed following market downturns and result in sizable increases in Bitcoin prices.” Two of Bloomberg’s sources have today claimed that Griffin briefed the CTFC on his findings earlier this year, although the academic has reportedly declined to comment in response to Bloomberg’s inquiries.This fall, Bitfinex has been plagued by rumors of insolvency and alleged banking difficulties, which it has officially denied. In late October, Tether redeemed and destroyed 500 million USDT from its treasury wallet; the action provoked yet further controversy given Tether’s recent — if brief — loss of its U.S. dollar peg. Such large-scale redemption prompted some to accuse the firm of manipulating the market by redeeming at low cost and liquidating after market rebound."

According to a GitHub issue report, this module was modified to load malware that is capable of stealing users’ private keys.BitPay’s post states that the BitPay app was not vulnerable to the malicious code, but that its team is investigating whether the vulnerability had been exploited against any CoPay users.In the meantime, the company has outlined advice for its users, stating that anyone using Copay version from 5.0.2 to 5.1.0, “should not run or open the app.” The company has released a security update in version (5.2.0), which is due for imminent release on app stores.The company also warns that users of affected versions “should assume” their private keys may have been compromised, and therefore move any holdings to new, secure v5.2.0 wallets “immediately”:“Users should not attempt to move funds to new wallets by importing affected wallets' twelve word backup phrases (which correspond to potentially compromised private keys). Users should first update their affected wallets (5.0.2-5.1.0) and then send all funds from affected wallets to a brand new wallet on version 5.2.0, using the Send Max feature to initiate transactions of all funds.”According to the GitHub issue report, a little-known user called right9ctrl requested and was granted publishing rights to the event-stream library (which is used in the Node.js module on the Copay app) from its previous maintainer, Dominic Tarr, who conceded he was no longer maintaining the repository and did not suspect the new user of malintent.In response to the news, Dogecoin creator Jackson Palmer yesterday tweeted his concern that “this is one of the major issues with JavaScript-based cryptocurrency wallets with heavy up-stream dependencies coming from NPM [Node.js package manager]. @BitPay essentially trusted all the up-stream developers to never inject malicious code into their wallet” – nor to “let [an] attacker in” inadvertently.Earlier this fall, Bitcoin Core released an update following the detection of a vulnerability in its software, a bug which the co-owner of Bitcoin.org described as “very scary,” with the potential to have “crashed a huge chunk of the Bitcoin network if exploited by any rogue miners.”"

the Bank of Thailand issued its circular), 113 Bitcoins were traded for ...","Nov 23, 2018","Since May 2014, Thailand has been under the control of a military dictatorship. And given that the coup, led by the Royal Thai Armed Forces, brought internet censorship, a suspension of the Kingdom's constitution, and a disbanding of its senate, casual observers would be forgiven for supposing that the Southeast Asian country is now possibly one of the least favorable places on Earth for the use and development of technological innovations.","However, while Thailand's earlier history with crypto might confirm this assumption, more recent months have provided a case study in how blockchain and cryptocurrencies can find a place even within rigidly authoritarian political structures. Slowly but surely, the military junta revealed and acted on plans to legalize ICOs, to authorize crypto-exchanges, and also to enforce regulation that legitimizes crypto. And this all comes at a time when the same junta has re-permitted political activity in anticipation of next year's general election, raising the very strong possibility that crypto will play an even bigger role in Thailand's economic and political life as the nation continues forging its path towards modest liberalization.Much can happen in crypto in a single year, and nothing proves this more than the progress Thailand has made in fostering a crypto-friendly environment. Having previously taken an ambivalent stance towards cryptocurrencies, the central Bank of Thailand issued an order to the country's banks in February, requesting that they stop directly dealing with any company that trades or works with cryptocurrencies, pending the passage of future legislation.Less than two weeks later, Bangkok Bank became the first financial institution in the country to act on this decree, halting its transactions with the Thai Digital Asset Exchange (TDAX). TDAX founder Poramin Insom explained:""The bank called and asked whether there was an operating licence for proof, but I answered that this business was not under legal jurisdiction [hence the absence of an operating licence], so the bank said it would terminate the company's bank account, as this business had no licence.""A few days later, the state-owned Krungthai Bank followed suit and also announced that it was ceasing all business with TDAX, after its chairman – Somchai Sujjapongse, a permanent secretary at the Finance Ministry – gave an official order to do so. Together with Bangkok Bank's previous action, this struck an ominous note for the cryptocurrency industry in Thailand, particularly when TDAX decided to cease new ICO registrations, for fear that Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) were responsible, more than anything else, for turning the Thai government against crypto.Considering critical remarks made at the time by Sujjapongse about Bitcoin, few would have imagined a particularly rosy future for cryptocurrencies in Thailand. He said in February:""Allowing Bitcoin transactions to be made without warnings and direction from regulators is not acceptable.”Nonetheless, his allusion to regulators revealed that Thailand's emerging approach to crypto wouldn't involve banning it outright, but rather ensuring that it operated within a context in which consumers and the wider Thai economy were protected.Indeed, a month later, the government published its much-anticipated first draft of regulations for digital assets. These were cautious, yet in outlining a capital gains tax of 15 percent and requiring all crypto-platforms to register with the relevant authorities, they were clearly aimed at making crypto an integral part of Thailand's economic landscape. This was confirmed in May, when the regulatory framework came into force, requiring token traders and sellers to register with the Thai Security Exchange Commission (SEC) within 90 days, or face fines of at least 500,000 baht (around $15,700) and/or maximum jail terms of two years.While the Thai military government unsurprisingly had an anti-democratic, hardline reputation around this point, there was arguably never any question of cryptocurrency being banned or severely curtailed in the country. That's because crypto was already far too popular for the government to do anything meaningful to restrict it.For example, in the week ending February 17 (during which the Bank of Thailand issued its circular), 113 Bitcoins were traded for Thai baht (THB) on the Local Bitcoins exchange. By comparison, only 20 Bitcoins were traded for Turkish lira on the same exchange in the same week, while only 12 were traded for Argentine pesos. According to the International Monetary Fund, both of these countries have economies bigger than Thailand's, sitting respectively at 17th and 21st on the global table, compared to 26th for Thailand.In conjunction with the fact that both Turkey and Argentina have been suffering from serious inflation this year, such figures offer a vivid indication of how big crypto is in Thailand, and how foolish the Thai government would have been to attempt a full crackdown. And considering that the Thai economy actually contracted following the 2014 coup, it's clear that crypto is far too big an opportunity for any Thai government to neglect. This is especially true when fears surrounding economic growth persisted to the beginning of this year, as Thailand failed to match GDP increases enjoyed by neighboring Vietnam and the Philippines.It's therefore no surprise that, more recently, the government has increasingly strived to nurture Thai crypto. Not only did the SEC implement regulations in July that permit ICOs (so long as they're based in Thailand), but it confirmed a month later that it had already authorized seven companies – including TDAX – to operate as exchanges and/or carry out crypto-related business in the country.At the same time, it also announced that it was receiving a large number of applications for licensing from other Thai startups and firms, which were interested in either holding an ICO or opening a digital asset exchange. This came as the Bank of Thailand permitted the country's banks to open subsidiaries for the express purpose of handling and working with cryptocurrencies, something which theoretically “ring-fences” them and the Thai economy from any risk of instability.In parallel with the development of this new, semi-permissive legislative environment, the Thai government has itself also been looking towards cryptocurrencies and blockchain.Back in June, the Bank of Thailand's governor, Veerathai Santiprabhob, revealed that the central bank was looking into the possibility of issuing its own cryptocurrency for the purposes of enabling faster interbank settlements.""Like other central banks, our goal is not to immediately bring CBDC [central bank-issued digital currency] into use, but rather to explore its potential and implications for back office operations.”In August the bank announced that it would indeed be building its own CBDC, using R3's Corda platform.Encouragingly for crypto, Santiprabhob said in a November interview with Thai media that he expects that the country and its financial institutions will need three to five years to make the “switch” to digital currencies. Half a decade might seem like a long time for some impatient investors, but given that such a statement hints at the Bank of Thailand’s long-term intentions to adopt crypto at scale, it provides positive confirmation that cryptocurrencies will have a permanent home in the Asian country.The central bank hasn't been the only part of the Thai establishment to explore crypto and blockchain in recent months. In late July, the Thai Bond Market Association said that it would begin using a private blockchain to register bonds by the end of the year, and that it's looking into introducing its own utility coins to support the system. While in October, the Ministry of Commerce detailed plans to trial decentralized ledger technology in the areas of copyright management, agriculture, and trade finance.There is, then, a big opening up in Thailand towards crypto and the economic opportunities it provides. However, even if there is now a process of partial liberalization underway in the military-controlled nation, the crypto industry should be under no illusion that the Thai government is still anything but highly cautious when it comes to cryptocurrencies.Back in October, the Thai SEC issued warnings about nine unregistered tokens and ICOs. This was ostensibly to highlight the financial risk they might carry for the public, although the warning also offered some indication of just how jealously it and the Thai government watch for anything that might undermine their power and oversight.Similarly, the Deputy Prime Minister, Wissanu Krea-ngam, gave a speech at the beginning of November in which he said the government wants to do more to regulate cryptocurrencies and to prevent them from being misused by terrorists, criminals, and money launderers.Given that Thailand has the 13th highest number of terrorist incidents in the world (according to the Global Terrorism Database), this is a reasonable aim, but there's a worry that it may invite mission creep, as the government increasingly curbs legitimate crypto-related activity in a bid to curb illegitimate activity.Thailand began using the death penalty again this year after a nine-year moratorium, while the new king – Bhumibol Adulyadej – has taken steps to consolidate his power in the wake of his father's death. Such features of national life arguably create an unfavorable climate for crypto, which is often sold as a means of distributing and weakening central power, rather than as a way of bolstering it. However, plans to hold a general election next year – as well as the Thai government's slow-and-steady approach to legislation – do at least suggest that there is an increasingly assured place for the crypto community to do business in Thailand, so long as they stick obediently to the rules."

The analysis tracked the correlation between coverage on crypto values over the past five years and the sentiments of published materials.,"Source: ClovrIn the course of its research, Clovr surveyed 48 mainstream U.S.-based and international media outlets for pieces covering cryptocurrency from Jan.1, 2013, to July 31, 2018. All articles were analyzed using sentiment analysis tool Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner (VADER) and the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library in Python. The analysis included the full text of 7,527 online news articles.In the last weeks of 2017 crypto coverage in the media spiked following a sharp drop-off in cryptocurrency, which was attributed to a confluence of factors such as strong performance of altcoins, and Bitcoin (BTC) holders selling off their coins to pay for holiday purchases. The same trend was reported in May and June 2018, when a further drop in crypto values was followed by a temporary increase in articles. The study further reads:“As recently as 2016, positive articles far exceeded negative ones, both in terms of volume and intensity. As coverage surged in mid-2017, however, articles expressing negative sentiment grew more common. This trend was fueled in part to grim prognostications by the likes of Warren Buffett and Mark Cuban, who guessed that ‘a bubble’ was underway.”Source: ClovrAs for news sites that covered digital currency most often, Clovr notes Forbes and Business Insider, where “a combined 1,335 articles from these two outlets alone were more positive than the overall median sentiment of the sampled articles, while only 413 of their articles fell on the negative side.”CNBC released almost 1,000 crypto-related articles during the analysed period, with 52.9 percent being positive and 47 percent being negative. At the same time, American far-right news website Breitbart News along with left leaning American news organization Raw Story cumulatively published 91 negative articles and just one positive piece. The average sentiment of Reuters, USA Today, and Gizmodo articles reportedly decreased substantially over time.As previously reported, BTC use for commercial payments reduced significantly this year, according to a study by Chainalysis. Although Chainalysis recognizes a growing stability of BTC, the value of Bitcoin payments reportedly slumped from $427 million last December to $96 million in September 2018."

Among other things, the bill will recommend creating an asset class for cryptocurrencies and digital assets that would prevent them from being classified as securities.In November, Ohio reportedly became the first state to accept tax payments in Bitcoin (BTC) from businesses, with plans to accept payments from individual filers in the future."

trading, while its parent company OKCoin had been trading Bitcoin ( ...","Nov 25, 2018","Last week, OKEx exchange faced negative publicity and accusations of marketing manipulation after adjusting Bitcoin Cash (BCH) futures settlements during the notorious hard fork.","On November 20, the exchange responded to those allegations, essentially defending its decision and promising to provide evidence if the case goes to court. Curiously, it is at least the third time this year that OKEx has shown strange price volatility on their exchange.OKEx was founded in 2017 as an international arm of the no longer operating Chinese exchange OKCoin. According to data from CoinMarketCap, it is currently the second largest player by volume, handling more than $1 billion worth of crypto trades per day. OKEx is based in Belize and has an operating hub in Hong Kong. Moreover, in April 2018, the company expanded its presence to Malta, citing their “confidence” in the local government’s approach to cryptocurrencies.The exchange has been focusing on futures trading, which is basically an agreement to buy or sell an asset on a specific future date at a specific price, hence representing a risk management tool for investors.On Nov. 3, 2017, OKEx launched its Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Ethereum (ETH) futures trading, while its parent company OKCoin had been trading Bitcoin (BTC) futures since 2014. In December 2017, crypto futures received wider recognition after mainstream exchanges Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) and Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) introduced BTC futures trading to the wider market.On Nov. 14, amidst the Bitcoin Cash hard fork that resulted in two different blockchains, BCH ABC and BCH SV, being born, OKEx abruptly forced the early settlement of its Bitcoin Cash contracts “to avoid potential losses to [their] customers caused by the short-term volatility and possible market manipulation attempts.” Thus, the BCH future contracts were settled early against the last traded price at early Nov 14, shortly after the announcement.The move was criticized by a number of investors, who claimed that they had suffered major losses as a result of OKEx’ decision. Namely, Amber AI, a Hong Kong-based crypto firm co-founded by former Morgan Stanley trader Tiantian Kullander, as per LinkedIn, published a Medium article on the matter, arguing that OKex had changed the rules of the settlement index by discontinuing to reference Bitfinex prices before the early settlement. The update details were published on November 12, just two days prior to the event:“By changing the settlement date and delivery rule against the open interest in the market, [OKex] invalidated their previous announcement. This meant that for each short position carried in the contract, OKEx implicitly imposed a fixed loss on the notional amount, delivering the contract 20% higher vs fair value.“This is no different than the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) announcing that the S&P 500 E-Mini Futures will settle against the Shanghai Composite Index in the midst of trading.”Additionally, Amber AI accused OKex of intentionally malfunctioning the order submission system on Nov. 15, during BCH “most volatile trading session in 9 months.” According to the crypto company, traders were unable to submit their orders due to a “Limit Order Bug,” although OKEx continued to operate at large:“Recorded level-2 data throughout this period shows the order matching engine as functioning. The exchange continued to host traffic and operate but with all order submissions blocked, except buy-orders below the best bid, and sell-orders above the best offer.”Amber AI continued with even more allegations by claiming that OKex “sponsored” a company called ‘Honeycomb Finance’ to publish a Reddit post allegedly supporting the exchange’s point of view. Finally, Amber AI claimed that OKEx ultimately imposed a BSV liability for its BCH borrowers despite allegedly writing that “users who have outstanding borrow of BCH, [...] will not need to repay BSV” before silently updating its announcement.Ultimately, traders lost “$24 million” due to the incident, the post argues, continuing:“The course of events surrounding the BCH hard fork are indicative of market manipulation, fraud and deceit.”There were others who have voiced their discontent in regards to how OKex handled the BCH hard fork. Thus, Qiao Changhe, the founder of Beijing-based Consensus Technologies, told Bloomberg that his fund lost $700,000 because its hedging position on OKEx “was abruptly closed at a level that didn’t reflect prevailing market prices”:“OKEx is losing its credibility [...] The futures contract became something nonsense, not something we could use to hedge.”Changhe also added that he was going to reduce his $5 million fund’s use of OKEx because of that incident. Bloomberg mentions four other alleged traders who chose to stay anonymous, but also confirmed that they were going to limit or end their relationships with the exchange. One of them reportedly filed a complaint with Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), whilst the agency’s spokesman declined to comment after being approached by Bloomberg.OKEx has issued a number of comments regarding the incident. First, the exchange explained its reasoning in a blog post published shortly after the hard fork, on Nov. 15. In it, OKEx said that they brought the delivery time earlier because of strong volatility and unclarity of “the final outcome.”“An early announcement may make room for market manipulation and cause loss to our users,” the exchange added when explaining the urgency of the move.Further, on Nov. 19, Andy Cheung, head of operations at OKEx, echoed that response in a comment for Bloomberg:“After considering various scenarios, we decided that an early settlement was the most fair and rational decision to maintain an orderly market.”On Nov. 20, OKEx directly addressed Amber AI’s article via Medium. First, the exchange claimed that they “do not have an institutional client profile named Amber AI, while Amber AI claim themselves as a Hong Kong-based company,” adding that OKEx “[does not] serve any customer in Hong Kong, in respect of the local laws and regulations”.“The OKEx account that Amber AI claimed managing is an individual account, which is not a Hong Kong resident or entity on the report of the KYC information,” the exchange then disclosed. “Amber AI made a profit from the individual account on OKEx they claimed to have managed during the early delivery.”More importantly, OKEx denied any manipulation, noting that Amber AI’s statements “have caused serious damages to OKEx' reputation” and that “majority of [OKex’] users supports our decision of early delivery of BCH futures contracts.” The exchange also stated that it is ready to address the allegations in court:“We will disclose the evidence required to the court to prove that OKEx is not involved in the alleged trading when deemed necessary. We reaffirm that we will NEVER [sic] trade against our customers and manipulate the market.”There are at least two other similar incidents involving OKEx that happened in 2018. First, there was an abnormal pricing drop on March 30 when the exchange posted quarterly futures market that were significantly lower BTC/USD readings comparing to the rest of the market. In a video that was circulating on Twitter at the time, an OKEx trader who allegedly lost 11 mln yuan ($1.75 mln) in the debacle was threatening CEO with committing suicide by drinking poison at the exchange’s office in Hong Kong.OKEx blamed the issue on users closing huge numbers of contracts “regardless of costs.”“OKEx has the right to warn against all unethical behavior such as malicious manipulation of prices, malicious influence on trading systems, restrictions on trading, shutting down of accounts, etc.,” the company’s statement shared with clients read. OKEx also confirmed that a rollback had been completed, and that normal trading operations would resume shortly.Furthermore, in August, OKEx featured in another situation involving strange market fluctuation after forced liquidation of a large misfired Bitcoin futures trade worth $416 million was initiated by an unknown trader.Due to the “sheer size of the order” — a hefty 4,168,515 contracts, according to the exchange — OKEx said it took preemptive action, explaining that their risk team asked the client to “partially close the positions to reduce the overall market risks” several times.“However, the client refused to cooperate, which lead to our decision of freezing the client’s account to prevent further positions increasing  Shortly after this...unfortunately, the BTC price tumbled, causing the liquidation of the account.”The exchange then allegedly injected 2,500 BTC (around $18.5 million at the time) into an insurance fund to help mitigate the losses incurred by the force-liquidated trade.Crucially, it was revealed that aside from this insurance cover, the platform did not provide the funds that traders use to leverage their futures contracts. Instead, it relied on the so-called “socialized claw-back” policy for such cases, meaning that the losses from the unfilled order would need to be covered by counterpart traders. In that particular instance, some traders were set to lose 18 percent of their profits.OKEx’ official statement outlined measures the exchange was undertaking to “prevent similar cases” from occurring again and to enhance risk management and thwart possible manipulation.In a comment for Cointelegraph at the time, OKEx head of operations, Andy Cheung, claimed that this had been a “valuable lesson” for him and OKEx."

This is making some blockchain companies rethink their business models and cut employees.","However, the slump didn’t prevent the blockchain industry from experiencing a human resources boom, as evidenced by an active growth of vacancies associated with blockchain and digital assets, according to the latest study by recruiting site Glassdoor.As estimated by LinkedIn analysts, 645 vacancies tagged with the words “blockchain,” “Bitcoin,” or “cryptocurrency” were published on the site in 2016. By 2017, this value has surged to approximately 1,800 and to 4,500 vacancies by mid-May of this year. As of now, LinkedIn’s search system displays 13,816 records related to blockchain and 2,479 records related to cryptocurrency.These estimates are supported by recent data published by Glassdoor’s recruitment portal. As of August 2018, United States companies had posted 1,775 vacancies related to blockchain technology, which is three times more compared to the previous year.As noted in the Glassdoor report, 79 percent of the vacancies are concentrated in the 15 largest American cities, and the most saturated demand regions show that New York and San Francisco account for 24 percent and 21 percent of the total number of crypto-industry job openings. The current total number of blockchain and cryptocurrency vacancies worldwide has grown to around 3,000 and 900 correspondingly.Software developers are the highest demanded occupation, with 19 percent of vacancies published by employers seeking employees falling into this category. In addition to programmers and technical specialists in the crypto industry, there is a shortage of product managers, risk analysts and marketing specialists.Traders and investment analysts are not among the most sought-after professionals in the crypto industry. But there are more and more vacancies for specialists in new disciplines that have appeared in the wake of blockchain technology’s popularity — “Decentralized Finance,” “Decentralized Internet,” and “Security Hardware.”However, if taking into consideration the last three months, a fuller picture looks partially different. According to the extended analytics shared by job-search platform Indeed with Cointelegraph, from October 2017 to October 2018, job-seeker interest for roles related to Bitcoin, blockchain and cryptocurrency declined by 3 percent, while employer interest for roles related to the same terms only rose (25.49 percent), which was different than the interest levels from the year before by both parties.If looking at data from 2016 to 2017, job-seeker interest for roles related to Bitcoin, blockchain and cryptocurrency rose by 481.61 percent, while employer interest for roles related to the same terms rose by 325 percent.The following graph shows both the growth of job-seeker interest in jobs with these keywords and the growth of job postings for jobs with these keywords for that time period.Today, IBM, ConsenSys and Oracle have the greatest need for qualified personnel. Each of them has more than 200 corresponding vacancies, as Glassdoor reports. They became strong competitors of the industry leaders like crypto exchanges, among which Coinbase and Kraken have the greatest need for qualified personnel. The list of major employers for blockchain professionals has also been joined by larger consulting firms Accenture and KPMG. At the same time, the lack of vacancies related to blockchain from such giants as Facebook, Google and Apple could be noted.The need for crypto industry experts isn’t a uniquely American phenomenon. In August, Cointelegraph reported a 50 percent increase in the number of vacancies associated with blockchain and cryptocurrency in Australia, India, Singapore and Malaysia compared with 2017. At the same time, developers who are proficient in the Python programming language are among the most desirable candidates.The lack of qualified personnel means higher salaries for blockchain specialists. As estimated by Glassdoor, the average base salary for such employees is $84,884 a year. This is 62 percent higher than the average wage in the United States ($52,461 per year). At the same time, the variation in salaries ranges from $36,046 for junior developers to $223,667 a year for qualified software engineers.Blockchain developers with three to five years of experience can earn “half-a-million-dollars” a year, according to Blockchain Developers recruitment agency. At the same time, analysts suggest that newcomers can count on a salary “definitely well over $120,000.”Company executives also noted the increase in salaries in the blockchain and cryptocurrency industry. According to David Schwartz, chief cryptographer at Ripple, the hiring packages have ""gotten insane"" since “ICOs dumped a bunch of money on the industry.” In particular, a couple of Ripple developers received “$1 million signing bonus offers,” Schwartz disclosed.Notably, the current average salary of software engineer at Ripple is $125,000, as estimated by Glassdoor. Given the fact that the same job was paid $85,000 in May 2018, according to Paysa, it doesn’t seem the crypto market prices affect the developers salaries, at least not at Ripple.Some employers attribute the decline in the quality of products produced by developers to the increase in salaries. According to Alex Ferrara, partner at Bessemer Venture Partners, which invests in crypto funds, such an “overeagerness” is “impacting the pace of development. A lot of these projects are way behind on their launch schedules.”The current realities of the blockchain industry has been continuously battered by a declining cryptocurrency market, which is partially responsible for the tightening of staff shortages. As raising funds through ICO became more accessible than crowdfunding, qualified specialists prefer to launch their own projects and begin to assemble their development teams, as was the case with Amber Baldet. The leader of JPMorgan Chase’s blockchain team left the company on April 2 to start her own project. As a result of such “forks” inside companies, the shortage of personnel is becoming increasingly acute.The popularity of cryptocurrency as a means of remuneration is also growing, although not as quickly. On Sept. 17, HR startup Chronobank published the results of its survey of 445 crypto enthusiasts from around the world, including the U.S., Australia and Russia. The respondents were asked in which currency they preferred to receive wages.Two-thirds (66 percent) of them stated that they were ready to be paid for work in Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. The majority (83 percent) of respondents indicated they were supportive of receiving their bonus payments in digital money. Of the individuals interviewed, 72 percent said that, when choosing their next job, they would prefer an employer who offered the possibility of paying salaries in cryptocurrency.One-fifth of the respondents indicated that they would exchange cryptocurrency, received as wages, for traditional money. Notably, half of the respondents believe that if they receive a salary in cryptocurrency, they will spend less than they do now.The results of the latest survey conducted by peer-to-peer (p2p) platform Humans.net demonstrated the high level of interest and readiness among U.S. citizens to get paid in cryptocurrencies. Eleven percent of 1,100 freelancers responded that they would like to have their salaries be paid in digital money, and 18 percent expressed their desire to receive a part of their wages in crypto.Today, wages in cryptocurrency are popular mainly inside the industry. On Aug.18 TechCrunch editor Michael Arrington tweeted that Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao told him that 90 percent of the company's employees preferred to receive a salary in the platform’s native token, Binance Coin (BNB).In December 2017, GMO Internet, a Tokyo-based IT giant, announced its plans to start paying salaries in cryptocurrency. The company intended to pay up to 100,000 yen ($884) of over 4,000 employees monthly salary in Bitcoin. Bitcoin.com also offers its employees the opportunity to get paid in Bitcoin Cash, given the information from job openings located on its website.However, cryptocurrency wage payment goes beyond the industry. In August, semi-professional football club ""Gibraltar United"" announced plans to pay its players a salary with a cryptocurrency called Quantocoin. Club owner Pablo Dan believes that the use of cryptocurrency provides greater transparency and, most importantly, simplifies financial relations with foreign footballers playing for the club. Experts believe that the salaries in cryptocurrency will help international companies attract remote foreign specialists.“Several U.S.-based companies are paying their international workers in Bitcoin, as it can save both the company and the employee money,” Bloomberg Law analysts suggest. According to the statistics published on the company’s website, nearly 200 companies use Bitwage, a service allowing employees and freelancers to receive payments in cryptocurrency. As estimated by Bloomberg Law, about 65 percent of Bitwage clients are U.S. companies, and 95 percent are using it for paying wages to international workers.The current statistics, located on the Bitwage’s website, shows that over $31 million has been paid to employees by the companies through this service. Among the clients mentioned are Google, Facebook, Uber and Airbnb.For some people, cryptocurrency payments become more than just a new way to carry out the transactions. Workers in such regions like Latin America, which might not have a matured banking system or stable currency, are given the ability to be paid in cryptocurrencies. For example, developers in Venezuela got more business opportunities and revenues with the advent of Bitcoin. However, receiving wages in cryptocurrency may involve tax liability.The main obstacle to the spread of cryptocurrency salaries remains the lack of clearly defined legislation, including tax rules. Today, the regulatory approaches of different countries and their views on the taxation of digital money vary greatly.In the European Union, there are no special rules for regulating activities related to digital money, and the taxation of crypto transactions is regulated by the national legislation of each country. As a result, in France, digital currencies are subject to capital gains taxes, with fees of 14-45 percent. Germany doesn’t charge any taxes as long as cryptocurrency is used as a means of payment. Bitcoin has no established legal status in the U.K,, but is commonly treated as a foreign currency for most purposes, including value-added and goods-and-service taxes.Asian countries offer a different approach to taxation of crypto-related activity. In Singapore, if digital currencies are part of the taxpayer's investment portfolio, then the profits from selling them are not taxed, since they are considered capital gains. Notably, Bitcoin is recognized not as money but as a service, and therefore a tax on goods and services (local analogue to VAT) is applied to it. In China, cryptocurrency transactions are subject to income tax and capital gains tax, and revenues are subject to taxation. Japanese individuals are charged from 15 to 55 percent for any activity related to Bitcoin.In Australia, cryptocurrency transactions are subject to income tax. In Canada, they are subject to income and capital gains tax, with up to 50 percent of the revenue charged. In the U.S., cryptocurrency owners pay taxes on digital money as they would on property.As blockchain technology and cryptocurrency give birth to new jobs, business models reliant on third-party involvement may become increasingly outdated. The bottom line is that smart contracts — decentralized, digitized commercial agreements — control the fulfillment of obligations by all parties and manage all essential financial flows. As a result, the third-party services of various kinds of intermediaries may no longer be required.Meanwhile, mediation services constitute a large segment of the modern economy. After all, in traditional contracts used by banks, brokers, authorities, realtors and others, it is the intermediary that describes the terms of the transaction, draws up the document template, monitors the execution of an agreement, and appropriates a significant part of the payment.Smart contracts automatically coordinate and ensure the interests of all parties, almost instantly and free-of-charge. Moreover, the inability to change information in the blockchain provides the highest level of security to all participants in the transaction, eliminating the possibility of data manipulation and deception. Basically, one smart contract can replace a room full of corporate lawyers, realtors, recruiters, risk managers and other professionals whose work essentially boils down to the formal assessment of documents.In addition to regulating labor relations inside the company, blockchain technology can become a magic pill for the freelancing industry. During the past couple of years, the scale of remote work around the world has increased significantly, and the sector is expected to continue to expand. Former U.S. Secretary of Labor Robert Reich calculated that in a couple of years, 40 percent of the U.S. workforce will be freelancers. However, this could lead to a number of issues since freelancers are not considered to be full-time employees, which means that they remain outside the scope of health insurance, pensions and other social benefits.Moreover, they are forced to use the services of aggregator sites, which primarily focus on the interests of the customer, and not the freelancers themselves. In addition, such platforms like Upwork charge up to 20 percent for a bill, and payments for the work performed are often delayed.Some projects use the advantages of blockchain technology to solve the problems that currently plague the freelance economy. Some provide freelancers with service where blockchain is leveraged to ensure paid vacation and sick pay when needed. Other solutions offer a blockchain-based system for resolving disputes between customers and freelancers. Some platforms are deploying blockchain-powered Human Resource Bank to allow p2p matching of potential employers with contractors on the basis of verifiability of all user data, and excluding the possibility of falsification.The use of blockchain technologies in social networks and internet sites for freelancers demonstrates the high demand of the industry for new solutions using advanced technologies and cryptocurrencies. The exclusion of intermediaries, direct communication, reputation systems is what the blockchain brings to the labor industry.The pace of development and the integration of blockchain and cryptocurrency in everyday life will likely depend on the position and attitude of national governments. Countries with a friendly position on cryptocurrency are already leaders in the use of blockchain technology.Florida residents pay for property taxes, driver's licenses, ID cards and car numbers in cryptocurrencies — Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash — using the BitPay payment system. The corresponding decree has been approved by the State Department of Taxes.Meanwhile, in 2017, China banned cryptocurrency trading, ICOs and cryptocurrency exchanges, and the result was a tenfold decrease in the circulation of cryptocurrencies. According to the country's central bank, the yuan's share in the Bitcoin market fell from 90 percent to 1 percent, and 88 crypto exchanges and 85 blockchain startups that had been operating in China since autumn 2017 left the country. In such conditions, the numbers of those who want to receive a salary in Bitcoin may also gradually drop.Another factor, which may impact the adoption of cryptocurrency in the labor market, is the price of digital currency. As of now, most cryptocurrencies are volatile, and that dramatically cools the enthusiasm of workers regarding the payments of wages in digital currency.As the sector continues to develop, mature and adhere to government-mandated regulations, the number of workers choosing to receive their wages in Bitcoin, Ether and other cryptocurrencies may become more and more common. Raj Mukherjee, senior vice president of products at Indeed, told Cointelegraph:“While over the last few years, Indeed saw a steady rise in job-seeker interest for roles related to cryptocurrency, our data shows that job searches for these roles really picked up around the time when the cost of Bitcoin was at its highest. Since then, job-seeker interest has gone down, but still remains strong.”On the other hand, the demand for specialists capable of solving specific tasks will grow. Stephane Kasriel, CEO of Upwork said:“In just a few years, more than 30 percent of the workforce’s essential skills will be new. We’re seeing that shift take place on Upwork, where new and emerging skills like blockchain surface on a monthly basis.""Large corporations like IBM and Microsoft have been willing to invest for the long term in blockchain by expanding hiring over the last year. The trend of mid-2018 will likely continue moving to smaller companies, as experts predict. Though the overall number of applications posted by job-seekers has declined by 3 percent since last year, the continuous fall in cryptocurrencies’ prices hasn’t affected the interest that companies seeking blockchain specialists have demonstrated."

dodgy CEOs. During the past 10 years since Bitcoin's inception in ...","Dec 4, 2018","Like many different industries, Hollywood’s involvement with cryptocurrencies and Initial Coin Offerings (ICO) has become a reality and a number of celebrities have looked to capitalize on the surge in interest and potential money to be made.","As Cointelegraph has previously explored, some celebrities have gone on to achieve success in their crypto-related ventures, while others have been embroiled in the ensuing mess of failed and fraudulent projects.Two major names in the entertainment industry fell victim to the fallout associated with a fraudulent ICO of crypto financial services startup Centra Tech.In 2018, the three co-founders of the project were indicted and charged with securities and wire fraud by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Centra Tech had raised $32 million during its ICO.Centra Card was advertised as a debit card reportedly backed by Visa and Mastercard, which allowed users to convert crypto into fiat currencies. Investigations revealed no actual partnership existed.Before any of this came to light, the founders of the project managed to get the backing of none other than boxing superstar Floyd ‘Money’ Mayweather. The boxer had posted a photo on Twitter with a Centra debit card in hand in September last year.Mayweather wasn’t the only high-profile celebrity to be tainted by association to the fraudulent project.American music producer DJ Khaled had also endorsed the project on social media, touting the Centra debit card on Instagram. Nevertheless, the post has since been deleted from his social media profiles.Last week, both celebrities had to face the music for their involvement with Centra Tech. The SEC formally charged both Mayweather and Khaled for unlawfully advertising the fraudulent ICO.Mayweather copped a heavy judgement from the regulator for not disclosing promotional payments from three ICO issuers, including $100,000 from Centra Tech. Khaled also failed to disclose a $50,000 payment from Centra Tech.Both celebrities refrained from admitting or denying the charges against them and agreed to pay penalties and restrictions to the SEC. Mayweather will pay $300,000 in disgorgement, a $300,000 penalty, as well as $14,775 in prejudgement interest.Khaled is set to pay $50,000 in disgorgement, $100,000 as a penalty, and $2,725 in prejudgement interest.The ramifications of their involvement goes further than financial penalties. Mayweather has agreed to collaborate with the ongoing investigation into Centra Tech and has been barred from promoting securities for three years. Khaled cannot promote any securities for two years.During the past 10 years since Bitcoin’s inception in Satoshi Nakamoto’s white paper, we’ve seen more than a few spin-offs and hard forks riding on the name of the preeminent cryptocurrency.In January 2018, a project named Bitcoiin2Gen was launched and was widely labelled as a pyramid scheme and MLM company. Its dodgy project prompted a warning  to consumers from the Tennessee Department of Commerce & Insurance (TDCI) Securities Division.What made things even more perplexing was that American actor Steven Seagal was revealed as the brand ambassador for the project’s ICO. The project claimed to be a peer-to-peer (p2p) payment system in the mould of Bitcoin, running on the Ethereum blockchain.Seagal’s involvement with the ICO didn’t go unnoticed by the SEC, which issued a statement directed at celebrities that warned of possible legal ramifications should they not be abiding by securities regulations:""Celebrities and others are using social media networks to encourage the public to purchase stocks and other investments. These endorsements may be unlawful if they do not disclose the nature, source, and amount of any compensation paid, directly or indirectly, by the company in exchange for the endorsement.""Just two months after its launch, the founders — along with Seagal — announced their departure from the project after the completion of its ICO in March.American actress, businesswoman, and socialite Paris Hilton also fell prey to a not-so-innocent ICO in 2017.Hilton had expressed her interest in the LydianCoin ICO in a series of now-deleted Tweets on Twitter. A few months laters, when the CEO of LudianCoin’s parent company was embroiled in serious legal trouble, Hilton publically distanced herself from the project.American rapper The Game also got involved in the world of ICOs in August 2017, posting a video on Twitter in which he promoted a blockchain-based platform focused on the marijuana industry.According to reports, the founders of the project did not register the ICO with the relevant regulators, which led to legal battles with initial investors.U.S. rapper T.I. faced a lawsuit from investors after his FLiK token seemingly failed in November. A group of 25 investors are reportedly suing the rapper and his business partner, Ryan Felton.The group had invested over $1,3 million in the token sale. It is claimed that T.I. and Felton used the money raised during the token sale to pump the price of the coin before dumping their FLiK tokens. The plaintiffs are looking for $5 million in damages from the duo.The SEC’s decision to charge both Mayweather and Khaled has made the consequences of unlawful promotions of ICOs clear for all to see.As the SEC enforcement division co-director, Stephanie Avakian, explained in the aftermath of the Mayweather and Khaled settlements, celebrity endorsements of ICOs can have far-reaching consequences for unassuming investors:""These cases highlight the importance of full disclosure to investors. With no disclosure about the payments, Mayweather and Khaled's ICO promotions may have appeared to be unbiased, rather than paid endorsements.""The SEC enforcement division co-director, Steven Peikin, urged investors to be wary of so-called investment advice on social media platforms:“Investors should be skeptical of investment advice posted to social media platforms, and should not make decisions based on celebrity endorsements. Social media influencers are often paid promoters, not investment professionals, and the securities they’re touting, regardless of whether they are issued using traditional certificates or on the blockchain, could be frauds.""The SEC’s stance has been given a significant clout by the sheer sum of money both Mayweather and Khaled have had to pay for their indiscretions. If anything, it sends a strong message to other celebrities that are being paid to tout projects."

the ...","Dec 4, 2018",,"The crypto market has been brutalizing of late – but many traders don’t realize that there is a plethora of financial instruments out there. Each offer investors a new way to back crypto, without relying on the highs and lows of cryptocurrency prices in an erratic and volatile market.But what are these alternatives – and are they really everything they’re cracked up to be?In many cases, some of the new products emerging in the crypto market are iterations of services that have existed in the old-fashioned financial world for years. Bonds are a good example. These have been kicking around for more than 500 years – and back in 1694, they were issued by the Bank of England to fund a war against France.How do they work? In essence, they are a fixed-income instrument that amounts to something of an “I.O.U.” Lenders give businesses the money that they need to achieve their aspirations, with borrowers usually receiving interest rate payments once per year until the full amount of the loan is due. When it comes to interest, this could fluctuate based on variable rates, or it may be fixed.Bonds have already been gaining momentum – with the World Bank hitting the headlines back in summer 2018. On August 10, the first blockchain-based bond was issued by the biggest bank in Australia - Commonwealth Bank of Australia. This is not the first debt instrument to be issued through blockchain – with Spain’s BBVA signing a $117 million loan over the summer in a bid to benefit from the traceability and transparency of smart contracts.The hope is that crypto bonds could enable blockchain-based businesses to generate money to grow – offering them an alternative from ICOs, which have had something of a torrid time of late. Although research in October suggested that more than $20 billion had been raised through initial coin offerings since the beginning of 2017, this has been slowing of late – with ICO funding for August 2018 ranked the slowest for 13 months.Futures have been a hot topic of discussion in the crypto world ever since Bitcoin reached the dizzying highs of $20,000 towards the end of 2017.These conversations have rumbled through right up to today, with the volatility seen in the crypto market showing no signs of abating. In brief, futures involve two parties agreeing to buy or sell cryptocurrencies at a previously agreed-upon price on a set date. Rather than being used as a mechanism that helps to boost profitability, futures are often relied upon as a way to mitigate risk.Why is this a compelling financial instrument? Let’s say you believe that Bitcoin’s value is going to rise in the coming months. You can buy a three-month contract for one Bitcoin at the current price and receive it at contract’s conclusion. If the price of Bitcoin rises dramatically over those 90 days, you would be buying it at the same price, resulting in a tidy profit.Of course, this instrument can work conversely. Let’s imagine that you bought Bitcoin at an optimal moment, but you think that the price is about to fall precipitously. Through futures, you have the opportunity to enter into an agreement where you sell the Bitcoin at its current price in three months’ time – and if its value tumbles, you pocket the profit. It’s fair to describe such behavior as a bet, as no one can predict where the market is going, but if you’re experienced and have insight into crypto movements, futures could prove indispensable.So yes: futures can help traders shield themselves against the perils of fluctuation – and give investors in countries where crypto is banned a chance to get involved. That said, it isn’t without risks. Given the dramatic highs and lows seen in crypto in recent months, you could argue that futures are tantamount to gambling. Red or black?Puns can never let you down during a heavy feature that focuses on crypto financial instruments. If you don’t think that futures are the future, options are an option for you. These instruments mean that you have the right to buy or sell Bitcoins at a particular price when the options mature, but you are not obligated to complete the transaction. There is often a premium for using these financial services.These dramatic shifts in the crypto market have sparked diversification by digital asset platforms – giving investors greater choice. Bonds, futures and options are beginning to flourish in the industry. For example, Bibox, an AI-driven exchange, has just launched bonds, aiming to give new opportunities to traders.A slowdown in ICOs has meant that startups are looking for new ways to raise capital, while investors are on the lookout for new ways to protect and grow their assets. Whether derivatives gain momentum in 2019 is yet to be seen, but there’s no doubt that chatter surrounding financial instruments is on the increase.Disclaimer.

The NTA will be able to solicit information on customers who are suspected of tax evasion, including names, addresses, and 12-digit individual identification numbers.The sources told the Mainichi Shimbun that the ruling coalition will start elaborating the new taxation system later in 2019, aiming to introduce it by the new fiscal year in April 2020. Due to privacy concerns, the NTA will likely request data only on those users who presumably earned over 10 million yen (approximately $88,700) from crypto transactions.Under the current legislation, crypto exchanges and other businesses serving as middlemen in the crypto area may provide the data on customers voluntarily, or refuse to do so. In case the above-mentioned legislation is introduced, the intermediaries will still be able to appeal requests to turn over information.According to a recent NTA survey cited by Mainichi Shimbun, over 300 individuals declared they earned at least 100 million yen from crypto deals in 2017. The paper links it to a drastic market increase in the end of 2017, when Bitcoin (BTC) jumped to a record $20,000.Earlier in October, a Japanese taxation policy committee held a debate on simplifying the complex tax filing regime currently in place for Japanese citizens. The officials then stated they wanted to stimulate a more thorough reporting of cryptocurrency gains.The Financial Services Agency (FSA), the Japanese financial regulator which also oversees the crypto industry, is also reportedly planning to introduce stricter Initial Coin Offering (ICO) regulations to protect investors from fraud. Unnamed sources report that under the new law, ICO business operators will be obliged to seek registration from the FSA."

Inside the ...","Nov 26, 2018","On November 2, Taiwan officially tightened anti-money laundering (AML) policies targeted at crypto exchanges, requesting exchanges to monitor and prevent any illegal transaction processed using digital assets.","According to the newly drafted Money Laundering Control Act and Terrorism Financing Prevention Act approved by the Legislative Yuan, one of the five branches of the Taiwanese government, the country’s Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) now has authority over crypto exchanges to ban transactions suspected of being tied to fraudulent operations.Taiwan’s Ministry of Justice (MoJ) released a statement following the approval of the new AML bill, emphasizing that the government is working towards meeting international AML standards by encouraging businesses to foster a “compliance culture and mindset.”Until this year, the government of Taiwan was skeptical towards regulating the local cryptocurrency exchange market and blockchain sector.South Korea, the third largest cryptocurrency exchange market, also refrained from implementing practical and efficient regulations to govern its local digital asset market until 2018, because it feared that investors would recognize it as a move to legitimize the cryptocurrency industry.Based on its recently passed AML bill and the stance of the country’s main financial watchdog towards the cryptocurrency sector, Taiwan is likely leaning towards regulating its local cryptocurrency and blockchain space to prevent fraudulent operations and criminal activities using cryptocurrencies.For decades, Taiwan has had a complicated relationship with China. The official name of Taiwan is the Republic of China (RoC) and since the RoC's loss of the mainland to the People’s Republic of China (PRC) governed by the Communist Party of China, the PRC has consistently claimed sovereignty over Taiwan and said that the ROC is no longer in legal existence.Although Taiwan has claimed to be the legitimate government of China, the loss of Hainan in 1950 has limited the jurisdiction of the Taiwanese government to Taiwan and its two outlying islands Quemoy and Matsu.In recent years, mostly due to the increasing support of the U.S., the tension between Taiwan and China has continued to increase. On October 22, reports revealed that Taiwan is preparing to pitch for more U.S. arms and weaponry, after the U.S. approved the purchase of $330 million of arms sales to Taiwan in September.Representatives of Taiwan, the  U.S., and China had drastically contrasting viewpoints on the increasing arms sales from the U.S. to Taiwan.Lo Chih-cheng, a ruling-party lawmaker on the parliament’s defense committee, said that regardless of the relationship between Taiwan and China, the government of Taiwan must possess credible defense and sufficient weapons to defend the region from potential attacks:“In the worst case, we have only ourselves to rely on. We should not be so dependent on the U.S. in the long term. But we still need to buy weapons from the U.S. to secure our defenses while we are building our capabilities.”The Institute for National Defense and Security Research, an organization funded by Taiwan’s defense ministry, noted that the established conflict between the U.S. and China was “a strategic window of opportunity for Taiwan” to build a strong defense system to protect the region.However, the government of China fiercely opposed the arms sales of the U.S. to Taiwan. The foreign ministry in Beijing said in June of last year that the $1.4 billion deal had “severely damaged China’s security and sovereignty,” describing Taiwan as an “indispensable part of China’s territory.”At the time, Michael Kovrig of International Crisis Group said, “if this is, in fact, intentional timing, this does represent a change of tone. The Americans would clearly be aware that this is going to irritate the Chinese. It’s not leaving room for the Chinese to save face,” adding that any additional arms sales to Taiwan could worsen the relationship between the U.S. and Taiwan.In a period in which the Chinese mainstream media and state-backed publications are accusing U.S. President Donald Trump of playing a high-stakes game backing Taiwan, any activity to fuel the already intensified tension among the U.S., Taiwan, and China could lead to serious international conflicts and what the Chinese government call, “dire consequences.” The China Daily editorial reported on October 24:“Military hawks in Washington have tried hard to scare Beijing and console Taipei. But they should consider the dire consequences of their country being dragged into a costly confrontation that would in the first place be both unnecessary and avoidable.”  One of the few common areas the government of Taiwan and China agree on is the prevention of money laundering through the utilization of electronic payment systems including cryptocurrencies.Recently, in an attempt to completely ban money laundering efforts and fraudulent activities in the global cryptocurrency sector, the government of Japan also called for the establishment of standardized AML regulations regarding cryptocurrencies, specifically concerning anonymous cryptocurrencies like Monero, Zcash, and Dash. An FSA official said on October 24:“It should be seriously discussed as to whether any registered cryptocurrency exchange should be allowed to use such currencies. It's nearly impossible for Japan to handle the problem alone. Even if trade is restricted to only domestic transfers or monitoring is enhanced, it's still not enough to counter money laundering. It would be best if all the group of 20 industrial and emerging nations and regions (G20) would take the same steps toward prevention.”Over the past several months, led by Taiwan legislator and congressman Jason Hsu, the government of Taiwan has demonstrated a more proactive and open-minded approach towards regulating the local cryptocurrency market.In an interview, Hsu explained that a parliamentary coalition had been formed in Taiwan to focus on regulating blockchain and crypto with a set of guidelines targeted at cryptocurrency exchanges. He added that Taiwan is set to cooperate with Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong, and other Asian countries to facilitate the growth of the local cryptocurrency space.Hence, rather than China’s direct impact on Taiwan, a collective effort by the lawmakers and Congress of Taiwan to regulate the country’s cryptocurrency space most likely led to the changes in the new AML bill.“We have set up a parliamentary coalition in Taiwan’s parliament for blockchain, which is a bipartisan alliance designed to help support the industry. I have also launched self-regulatory organizations for blockchain and crypto, where we are working together to come up with a set of guidelines to regulate exchanges. These guidelines will provide basic parameters as to how crypto exchanges and other taxations are defined. When we announce the guidelines in the coming weeks, it will be a regional consensus with Taiwan, Japan and Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong as well as other Asian countries.”Taiwan legislator and congressman Jason HsuChina officially banned cryptocurrency trading in September 2017, expressing concerns towards money laundering and capital controls. The government has limited the outflow of the Chinese yuan to overseas markets for decades, and through exchanges, investors were able to bring capital outside of the local market prior to the ban.As Cointelegraph extensively reported, the government actively banned nearly every area in the cryptocurrency sector including events, media, and over-the-counter (OTC) trading, requesting AliPay, the country’s most widely utilized fintech application to block any transaction that is suspected of being connected to cryptocurrency exchanges.However, on Oct.r 25, 2018 the Shenzhen Court of International Arbitration officially stated that under local regulations, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum are considered properties and as such, holding or transferring Bitcoin is not illegal in China.“Chinese court confirms Bitcoin is protected by law. Shenzhen Court of International Arbitration ruled a case involving cryptos. Inside the verdict: China law does not forbid owning and transferring Bitcoin, which should be protected by law because of its property nature and economic value.”The ruling from the Shenzhen Court of International Arbitration essentially provided merchants with a green light to accept cryptocurrencies as a payment method without being in conflict with existing regulations.As of November, China’s oldest technology publication, Beijing Sci-Tech Report (BSTR), and several hotels and restaurants accept cryptocurrencies.Beginning January, BSTR will officially sell its yearly subscription in Bitcoin at a fixed price of 0.01 BTC. But, the publication reaffirmed that the purpose of the integration is to demonstrate the real-world potential and use case of the blockchain, and that if the price of BTC rises substantially, the publication will refund the buyers.Hence, while cryptocurrency trading remains prohibited in China, technically, owning or transferring cryptocurrencies is not illegal. As such, it can be argued that China, to a certain extent, is not wholly dismissive of crypto, given the government’s optimism towards blockchain technology as a core pillar of the fourth industrial revolution.The Xiongan government, tasked to build Chinese President Xi Jinping’s dream city, the Xiongan New Area, has made blockchain technology a key component of the project, working with Ethereum-related institutions, including ConsenSys, the largest blockchain software studio in the global sector, led by Ethereum co-creator Joseph Lubin, to develop blockchain-based tools for the government .Lubin said in July:“As one of our first major projects in the People’s Republic of China, we are excited to help define the many ‘use cases’ that could benefit from the trust infrastructure enabled by ethereum technology.”Singapore, Hong Kong, South Korea, and Japan, the four regions congressman Jason Hsu mentioned, have already evolved into major markets.Upbit, South Korea’s second largest cryptocurrency exchange and Binance, the world’s largest digital asset trading platform, according to the Blockchain Transparency Institute, have already established offices in Singapore and entered beta testing of their trading platforms with banking partners secured.Japan and South Korea, as two of the largest cryptocurrency markets, have demonstrated significant progress in terms of regulation and industry growth.To compete against the four markets, Taiwan would have to establish a strong selling point to attract cryptocurrency exchanges and blockchain-related businesses.Recently, the FSC of South Korea declared that banks are free to work with crypto exchanges and the Seoul Central District Court ruled a case between local cryptocurrency exchange Coinis, and major commercial bank Nonghyup, in favor of Coinis, establishing a precedent for the industry.Attorney Kim Tae-rim, who represented Coinis, said that the case is a milestone for the cryptocurrency sector as it would encourage banks to refrain from unfairly treating digital asset exchanges.“Cryptocurrency exchanges, by default, have the right to freely deposit and withdraw funds to and from major banks in South Korea, and an abrupt termination of partnership and services by the bank [in this case Nonghyup] without sufficient evidence or reasoning falls under the breach of contract.”So far, Taiwan has not led sufficient initiatives to lure in some of the biggest cryptocurrency and blockchain-related businesses from other major markets. But, if Hsu and the coalition continue to drive the adoption of crypto in Taiwan, in the mid-term, companies enter the market given that stable banking services and support from the government are guaranteed."

modifications can be made to support other cryptocurrencies as well.","Dec 12, 2018","On Wednesday 12th December, Stratis unveiled their C# Full Node. This long-awaited release is the culmination of two years’ worth of work from the Stratis team and represents the core service of their platform.","A computer running software which supports a cryptocurrency is called a node. A full node is a node which runs software to fully verify transactions and blocks.Up until now, Stratis’ full node software has been a placeholder for the C# Full Node, which has been in continuous development since their ICO in 2016. The legacy full nodes, referred to as the StratisX nodes, allowed Stratis both to function as a currency and also to grow to become a mature network with a high level of decentralisation and security.With the advent of the C# Full Node, however, the Stratis Platform can now go live. The C# Full Node is the foundation on top of which the rest of the platform sits. It is built from the ground up in the C# coding language, an industry standard language and part of the broader .NET framework, Microsoft’s own software ecosystem.The other services of the Stratis Platform all run on top of the C# Full Node software, including Sidechains and Stratis’ C# Smart Contracts - Turing complete smart contracts which execute .NET code on-chain, a first in the cryptocurrency space and only made possible by Stratis’ C# Full Node. You can learn more about these upcoming releases in Stratis’ stacked roadmap.The Stratis C# Full Node is more than just a node. It is a powerful and versatile development kit, offering developers huge flexibility in the development of blockchains and blockchain technologies. It supports multiple consensus protocols (PoW, PoS and PoA) and can connect to multiple chains. Currently, it supports both the Bitcoin and Stratis networks and with minor modifications can be made to support other cryptocurrencies as well.Stratis’ C# Full Node is modular, allowing users to pick and choose blockchain components as they see fit for their applications. It has a pluggable architecture, supporting the creation of sidechains, the deployment of smart contracts, remote procedure calls, a web API and the creation of Distributed Ledger Technology solutions, amongst other features.Stratis’ C# Full Node is fully open source. It is available on Microsoft’s Azure Marketplace and can be deployed directly to Azure. This is indicative of Stratis’s relationship with the Microsoft tech stack: they recently became a member of the Microsoft Partnership Network and an Independent Software Vendor.Stratis’ positioning within the .NET ecosystem comes with some distinct advantages, such as a familiar environment for developers and the ease with which the nodes can be deployed. Being able to host a C# Full Node on Azure will allow users to establish networks with very low network latency, in turn allowing for smaller block times and a larger maximum throughput. Such networks could be sidechains of Stratis, permissioned DLT solutions or new, independent blockchains.Out of the box, the C# Full Node uses a protocol which is very similar to the Bitcoin protocol. This means that developers who are confident in working with Bitcoin will find the Stratis C# Full Node a familiar software to work with. This, paired with its highly customisable architecture, allows developers to create nodes tailored to specific applications but still with a proven and familiar protocol.The C# Full Nodes come with various security improvements over the legacy StratisX nodes, new features for general users and numerous optimizations, including being able to download the Stratis blockchain significantly than the legacy StratisX nodes.The Full Node GUI, Stratis Core, is a user-friendly wallet which allows users to send, receive and stake their coins. The wallet is Hierarchical Deterministic, meaning users can generate multiple keys from one seed. This affords users greater security and easier recovery of funds.Besides these basic functions, Stratis Core also offers cold staking and a UI for sidechains. Cold staking will be activated once 95% of network staking is performed through the C# Full Node client, allowing users to participate in block production by staking with coins that are held in an offline wallet. This will significantly reduce risks associated with staking from a hot wallet.With the release of the Stratis C# Full Node, the Stratis Platform goes live. Stratis have published extensive documentation which accompanies this release and encourage any users to reach out directly to them for support and feedback. Alternatively, you can join their Discord."

According to the Times of India, an earlier chargesheet against two men alleged to have “direct links” with A. Bhardwaj had been filed in the city of Delhi.  At present, the chargesheet reportedly runs to over 1,800 pages, with reports from 15 complainants and 27 witnesses. It charges A. Bhardwaj with masterminding the allegedly fraudulent GainBitcoin crypto company, an investment scheme with a cloud-based platform for trading and mining Bitcoin (BTC).His brother, V. Bharadwaj, is accused of being a main “conspirator,” promoting, marketing and speaking at events organized around the scheme. Adlakha has been charged with complicity for his role as a promoter, and Bhope has been named as GainBitcoin’s secretary and “motivational speaker,” having reportedly personally assured investors of the scheme’s safety.The suspects will face a hearing Dec. 4, during which a copy of the court “challan” (document) will be provided to them and the charges finalized and framed. As the Times of India notes, while the challan pegs the alleged fraud at 6 crore rupees, the complainant has claimed it exceeded ₹10 crore (around $1.4 million), with an HC petition alleging it was “worth ₹40,000 crore ($5.6 billion).”As previously reported, the Bhardwaj brothers were arrested on Apr. 4 for allegedly defrauding around 8,000 investors out of ₹2,000 crores (about $300 million) via the GainBitcoin scheme, which they co-founded in 2013. The platform allegedly transpired to be a Ponzi scheme that guaranteed 10 percent monthly returns within 18 months.The Times of India today reports the two brothers have been detained in Pune jail as of their prior arrest; the latest complainant has claimed he was lured into the promises of the “high-yield” GainBitcoin investment scheme in 2016 upon meeting A. Bhardwaj in Dubai in 2016. When the complainant heard of the duo’s April arrest in Delhi, he is reported to have lodged his own complaint with the cybercrime cell of the UT police in Chandigarh.Also recently in India, the two founders of the country’s first cryptocurrency exchange, Unocoin, were arrested for opening a Bitcoin ATM without the appropriate registration."

Transaction Fees",https://cointelegraph.com/news/blockchain-networks-hard-fork-to-triple-tps-and-give-users-flexible-transaction-fees,"... also allows its blockchain to interact with all ARK-based blockchains, 
as well as other mainstream networks such as Ethereum and Bitcoin.","Nov 19, 2018",A blockchain network is preparing for the imminent hard fork to the second version of its core system on 28 Nov – with users set to benefit from flexible transaction fees and the ability to develop their own plugins with ease.,"ARK has been preparing Core V2 of its platform for some time, and has stressed that its community will not be affected by the hard fork as long as they update their desktop or mobile wallets to the latest version. Upon launch, exchanges and node operators will be required to update to the new core codebase.The team says one of the most exciting developments from the upgrade is its Dynamic Fees system, which enables ARK users to outline the maximum fee they are prepared to pay in order for their transaction to be completed.ARK wants to create a marketplace for transaction fees – offering flexibility to people who are prepared to wait a little longer for funds to clear in order to keep their costs down. The protocol-level change could also help increase levels of competition among delegates, who are responsible for including transactions in their blocks. There is a cap in the wallets on how high fees can go – meaning users who need their funds urgently won’t be facing exorbitant fees.ARK hopes to ensure that this system is achieved “without detracting from or confusing the seamless user experience” – and to keep its community informed, an advanced option is being made available where users can see the lowest and highest transaction fees paid over the past 30 days, in addition to the average. Mechanisms are also in place to prevent users from transferring more funds than they intended.Once the hard fork has been completed to Core V2, ARK says its platform will be able to handle three times more transactions per second (TPS). The number of transactions that can be placed in a single block is increasing from 50 to 150 – and this will increase TPS capabilities to 18.75. While this is by no means a limit, executives say “we don’t foresee the need to increase this further” for now.The new core is also going to help the platform build upon its goal of becoming the “WordPress of blockchains.” Improvements have been made to simplify the process of developing plugins that leverage the power of blockchain – and according to ARK, it only takes users a few lines of code to remove or add plugins to the system.Other notable features included in this upgrade include multisignature transactions, a brand-new API and webhook support, better verification measures, and one of the first blockchain plugin implementations that gives ARK the ability to be modular and fully customizable.As previously reported by Cointelegraph, ARK says it aims to create accessible tools which enhance understanding about blockchain technology and its potential. A SmartBridge feature also allows its blockchain to interact with all ARK-based blockchains, as well as other mainstream networks such as Ethereum and Bitcoin.ARK has stressed that Core V2 is not backwards compatible with its previous version but says the upgrade is not a contentious one, unlike with Bitcoin Cash. Though a soft fork was initially planned, its development team concluded this “would take too much time and effort” – distracting them from driving the platform forward.In a blog post, the team wrote: “All are in agreement that the upgrades are necessary and beneficial to the network. ARK will continue on as one network, with substantial upgrades, and a positive foundation for future development.”ARK says its open-source technology is free of charge and open to everyone – underpinned by a friendly community of experts who can offer advice and guidance.Looking ahead, the platform is preparing to launch a second version of its white paper, along with new editions of its desktop and mobile wallets. An e-commerce plugin called ARK Pay is also being released soon, and this will make it simple for websites to accept ARK as a payment method.As the end of 2018 nears, further updates on the items outstanding in its roadmap are going to be presented to the community.Disclaimer.

The latter is a platform which leverages blockchain technology to tokenize the trading, settlement and ownership of precious metals. Trudeau is also currently CEO of a Brooklyn-based crypto- and blockchain-focused startup consultancy firm.More broadly, as the press release notes, Trudeau’s experience in the digitalization of the U.S. equities market over the past decade has consolidated his expertise in trading technology and electronic exchanges within the context of regulated global financial markets.Trudeau’s official statement today characterizes the new ErisX venture as a “needed evolution to the way individuals and institutions trade digital assets” by integrating crypto spot trading and regulated futures contracts under one canopy. In his new role as CSO, he will reportedly be tasked with exploring “new avenues for revenue growth” and driving the firm’s “market structure efforts.”As reported in early December, ErisX raised $27.5 million from Fidelity Investments and Nasdaq Ventures, among others, following a prior investment from retail brokerage firm TD Ameritrade and others this October.The platform enters the crypto space as competition between major new trading and crypto investment ventures is set to gather pace; the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), operator of 23 leading global exchanges including the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), plans to launch its “Bakkt” digital assets platform at the end of January 2019.Bakkt, as is ErisX, is pending approval from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) for its own physically-delivered Bitcoin futures product.Meanwhile, Fidelity, which administers over $7.2 trillion in client assets, announced the launch of a new company, Fidelity Digital Asset Services, this October.

In July, Ledger announced that it had sold more than one million hard wallets in 2017, noting they were planning on attracting tech giants like Samsung and Google’s venture arm GV for further funding rounds.According to Skalkotos, would-be clients are already demanding options for security custody management for enterprises.“Secure storage of large multi-cryptocurrency funds is a highly complex challenge that cannot be solved by just implementing procedures,” he said, adding:“Institutions are looking for safer storage options along with integrated governance policies, but don’t want to sacrifice convenience.”Last month, payment network Square took the step of open sourcing its own cold storage tool, while fellow hardware manufacturer Trezor last week warned that counterfeiters were already targeting the industry with an influx of almost one-for-one counterfeit wallets."

Sirin Labs Token) without the need to use a centralized exchange.","Dec 2, 2018","After months of expectation and one of the top-five biggest ICOs of 2017, on Nov. 29 Sirin Labs has launched Finney, the 'world's first' blockchain smartphone. Yet, even with the endorsement of football legend Lionel Messi and a $157.8 million token sale behind it, the $999 device has stepped into uncharted territory, where its built-in cold storage wallet and DApp ecosystem will have to contend with the dominance of Apple and Samsung — as well as the Exodus 1, a rival blockchain smartphone from HTC.","Most of Finney's key features had already been announced prior to Thursday's launch: The smartphone comes equipped with an embedded cold storage wallet that's physically separate from the main hardware; its Sirin OS is a ""Google-certified"" mod of the Android operating system; it boasts AI-driven, cyber-threat detection; and it enables the direct exchange of selected cryptocurrencies (Ethereum, Bitcoin and Sirin Labs Token) without the need to use a centralized exchange.But at its launch event in Barcelona, Sirin Labs provided more concrete details as to its wider aims and expectations for Finney, revealing that the smartphone is just the beginning of its plans to bring blockchain technology to mobile devices.Most of all, the Israeli company used the launch event to emphasize how Finney is a smartphone that makes blockchain technology more accessible to a mainstream audience and that provides diehard crypto enthusiasts with a more practical way of securely managing their coins.“This is the most important computer of our generation — smartphone.”""The Finney phone is a one-stop shop,"" declared Sirin Labs' co-founder and co-CEO Moshe Hogeg during his presentation. ""Before the Finney, you needed a ledger, you needed a computer, you needed wallet software and then you needed to go to an exchange, and then you could convert. The Finney does all of this in one phone.""By having a cold storage wallet, a Token Conversion Service and crypto-exchange apps on a single device, Hogeg affirmed that Finney will take ""a huge step forward in bridging the gap between the blockchain economy and the consumer market,"" making the world of crypto more accessible to an audience that doesn't necessarily have the time or inclination to sign up for Kraken or Coinbase on their PCs and then buy a Ledger or Trezor wallet.Image source: Sirin LabsAnother, more predictable facet of Sirin Labs' plan to attract a mass market is that Finney comes with all the specs and functionality you'd expect from a 2018 smartphone. The phone has a 12MP (megapixel) rear camera, an 8MP selfie camera, as well as a 6-inch touchscreen, 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage memory. This puts it at least in the same league as this year's iPhone XS, which also has a 12MP rear camera (albeit a dual one), but actually a smaller, 5.5-inch screen, 4GB of RAM and a 7MP selfie camera.The fact that it boasts performance superiority in several departments here would help make the phone desirable to someone who may have been thinking about buying a separate hardware wallet and an iPhone XS (or Samsung Galaxy S9) — and just as importantly, so too will the ease with which its main features (the hardware wallet and DApp store) can be used.The process of transactions is quick and painless, involving the physical opening of the wallet (which is slid upward from the top of the phone) and a few taps of its touchscreen, as well as a few taps on the smartphone’s display (e.g. to choose which kind of transaction you want to make). One nice feature is that Finney enables the user to easily compare the addresses and transaction amounts shown in both the wallet's screen and the phone's, something which ensures that they won't end up sending coins to the wrong recipient as a result of a hack or bug.Yet, Sirin Labs is aiming with Finney to make cryptocurrency more accessible and popular in a number of other ways. First of all, the company famously recruited Lionel Messi to be Finney's brand ambassador back in 2017, hoping that 'the GOAT' and ‘a hacker on the camp’, according to Hogel, would be the best person to make Finney — and crypto — much more visible to a mass market.Contento de haber estado con los amigos de @sirinlabs hoy en Barcelona para seguir impulsando una mejor seguridad en los dispositivos móviles gracias a la tecnología Sirin OS. #SirinOS #SRN Happy to have been with my friends from @sirinlabs today in Barcelona to continue promoting improved security for mobile devices thanks to Sirin OS technology. #SirinOS #SRNA post shared by  Leo Messi (@leomessi) on Nov 29, 2018 at 11:49am PST""I think security and privacy is the number one priority right now. For everybody it's important, because we have all our content, all our lives on mobile phones […] Privacy is very important now more than ever, because right now there are lots of hackers, and people can steal your identity or your money.""Lionel MessiAdded to Messi's enviable reputation, Sirin Labs revealed that Finney will make crypto more accessible through the smartphone's dCENTER. Not only does this feature provide users with a DApp store for decentralized, crypto-related applications, but it actually rewards them with SRN Tokens for engaging and spending time with the apps it offers. Moreover, Hogeg claimed that owners can claw back around $300 of the phone's asking price by engaging with all of the apps available at launch.The company is referring to this program as 'Earn and Learn,' and in conjunction with the outreach-focused concept stores due to open in December in London and Tokyo, it shows how Sirin Labs hopes that the smartphone will serve as a champion for the wider cryptocurrency industry, and not just Sirin Labs itself.""Our entire concept is to bridge the gap,"" Erin Brazilay — Sirin Labs' Chief Commercial Officer — explained to Cointelegraph. ""And as such, we're going to open concept stores in London and Tokyo and other places. Our stores will be kind of an academy for the blockchain community; all the staff will be trained at the highest level, so people in the community can come and ask questions [about blockchain and cryptocurrency]. So that even someone who is a first-comer can come and get the full understanding of how the technology works. And there is nothing like that in the market.""The company is also releasing Finney with its own blockchain-focused operating system, Sirin OS, which it ambitiously aims to take beyond its own hardware. ""We have decided to develop the Finney, the first blockchain phone that runs Sirin OS. But this is only the beginning of the execution of our vision. Our vision is that every Android-based device would run Sirin OS. We are hoping for other OEMs [original equipment manufacturers] to adopt the Sirin OS and join us in the blockchain revolution.""In other words, Sirin Labs doesn't simply want to make blockchain phones, but to produce the platform for cryptocurrency and blockchain applications, becoming a kind of ‘crypto Google.’ If it can get a crypto-oriented operating system on, say, a Samsung, Huawei or HTC phone, then it will go a long way in making crypto mainstream, and this is why Erin Brazilay affirmed that Sirin OS is ""at least"" as important as Finney to Sirin Labs' longer term strategy: ""We need to put a lot of pressure on the OEM side, to convince them to adopt Sirin OS as the standard, de-facto technology to enable their phones to be blockchain-enabled.""As can be imagined, Sirin Labs is hopeful for Finney's future. Aiming to ship 100,000 units of the smartphone within one year, it's already accepting orders for the device on its website — and in January, the phone will also be available to buy via the Amazon Launchpad platform.However, other voices and industry figures are skeptical that the smartphone will have much of an impact outside of cryptocurrency circles. Speaking to Cointelegraph, Gartner's senior principal analyst, Tuong H. Nguyen, believes that it will appeal mostly to ""tech savvy"" individuals and ""early adopters.""""I would question the ability for this device to achieve mass market success. The broader question I think you’re asking is 'what is the appeal/must-have functionality that this 'blockchain phone' is providing?' The storage wallet applies to a niche segment of the mass market. Not only would it be appealing to the few people who own crypto, but it goes a niche deeper by trying to convince these few people they need a phone that specifically does this (put another way, why wouldn’t I buy a phone from a larger, more well-known OEM with tons of features — more than I would likely use — minus the crypto features?)""Not only does Sirin Labs have to contend with the possibility that Finney might appeal only to a ""niche segment"" of the market, but it also has more than one competitor in the blockchain-phone sector.For one, HTC is due to release the Exodus 1 in December — and like Finney, it's a high-end smartphone that features a cold storage wallet, although it is currently $39 cheaper than Sirin Labs' offering. And on top of HTC, there's one other manufacturer of a blockchain phone, Pundi X.Back in October, the India-based blockchain payment provider announced its very own ""XPhone,"" a smartphone due in Q2 2019 that can transmit phone calls, texts and mobile data using blockchain nodes, thereby avoiding the need to use centralized mobile networks. And as the company's vice president, Peko Wan, claimed to Cointelegraph, this ability to provide basic phone services via decentralization makes it more of a blockchain phone than Finney.""What makes the XPhone unique is that it actually uses a blockchain-based protocol for communicating data, making calls, sending messages and more. That means users communicate with each other securely and independently of a central carrier via nodes. We will stand by the uniqueness of the way in which we have reinvented blockchain for use as a transmission protocol for telephony and data of all kinds. In every sense, we have built a true blockchain phone.""Regardless of such opinions on whether it is a 'true' blockchain phone or not, what is clear is that, with Finney, Sirin Labs has taken an important step for the cryptocurrency industry. Within the space of a year, it has delivered on a massive ICO by releasing a high-performance and secure product that will provide actual utility and value to its users. This is something not many blockchain projects can claim to have done, and while it's hard to predict just where the future will take Finney and Sirin OS, it can only be a good thing that the crypto industry has finally begun producing gadgets all people can use."

The Calgary Dollar will allow holders to pay for services and goods at local shops, major Canadian media outlet Global News reports Friday, Dec. 7.","According to HuffPost Canada, the Calgary Dollar was initially launched in 1996, with citizens and businesses offering goods and services in exchange for the local currency alongside the Canadian dollar. This new move in 2018 allows citizens to download an app and store the digital currency on their devices.Calgary is reportedly the first city in Canada to launch its own coin. According to Global News, Alberta’s government supports the initiative. The officials expect that the Calgary Dollar could support small businesses and nonprofits by keeping funds within the city.Calgary Dollars work through a smartphone app that lists shops and restaurants that participate in the program. Citizens can spend their Canadian Dollars to pay for lunch, make a donation to some of Calgary’s nonprofits or buy inner transport tickets.One way to obtain the currency is by posting ads for goods and services that users want to sell in the app or on project’s website for Calgary Dollars, receiving a small amount of the digital currency in exchange for posting the ad.Recommending Calgary Dollars to a friend also brings profit. Moreover, Victoria Park, an events and culture district of Calgary, is reportedly offering cash back to shoppers who use the local digital currency.Local entrepreneurs, in their turn, can pay up to half of their business licenses with Calgary Dollars.As Cointelegraph has often reported, many countries are considering launching local digital currencies.In Mongolia, the country’s largest mobile telecoms operator plans to issue an e-currency, dubbed “Candy.” Meanwhile, in Dubai, consumers will soon be able to use digital currency to pay for goods, services and utilities following, a new government partnership with a blockchain payment provider.As well, the Bank of Thailand has plans to develop a wholesale central bank digital currency that will use blockchain consortium R3’s Corda platform."

E.g. we will have the Binance chain ready in the coming months, on which millions of projects can easily issue tokens.”According to Forbes, Binance announced their plans during a recent private event in Singapore hosted by Forbes Asia. Speaking at the “Decrypting Blockchain for Business” event, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) stated that the new plans actually indicate an old vision of crypto, which will expectedly lead to increasing its adoption on a global scale.In order to reach a fundamental “payment adoption increase,” CZ said that the company will be “pushing really hard into that space,” since their “original intent” hasn’t taken off “for some reason.”Forbes’ author Michael del Castillo, who unveiled the recent news, commented on Twitter that the he expects that there will be “millions of coins and thousands of blockchains.”On Nov. 8, CZ revealed that Binance’s business was still “very stable,” despite the recent exchange volume drop of around 50 percent, as well as the significant slump of crypto markets this year. The Binance CEO stated that while Binance possessed just 10 percent of the trading volumes they had in January 2018, the volumes are still higher than those of “two or three years ago,” and the business is “still profitable.”Recently,  Binance has launched its fiat-to-crypto exchange in Uganda, enabling its customers to purchase two major cryptocurrencies  — Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) — with local fiat currency Ugandan shillings (UGX).As of press time, Binance is one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, with an adjusted daily trade volume of around $587 billion, according to CoinMarketCap."

Financial news channel Cheddar reported on the platform launch Thursday, Dec. 6, citing PayPal’s director of innovation Michael Todasco.","According to Cheddar, the program was prepared by PayPal’s innovation team, which is based in San Jose, California, over a six-month period and was launched in mid-November.Employees using the program are granted tokens for participating in innovation-related programs and contributing ideas. These tokens are only valid within PayPal and can be traded among the participants of the program via “public ledger.”Todasco compared the reward system to Venmo — a mobile payment service that has public and private social media-like feeds. On the website designed for the token program, employees “can like and comment on and see all the activity going on within PayPal related to innovation,” Todasco explained.The tokens collected by staff can be exchanged for over 100 “experiences” offered on the platform. For instance, they can play poker with PayPal’s vice presidents, have coffee and a trail run with CFO John Rainey or practice morning martial arts with CEO Dan Schulman. One of the items even allows an employee to borrow a top manager’s dog for one day.As Cointelegraph previously explained, blockchain is frequently used for loyalty programs. For instance, United States household cleaning supplies manufacturer SC Johnson and environmental organization Plastic Bank recently launched a recycling campaign in Indonesia, granting tokens to local citizens for waste collection.As well, Spanish banking giant BBVA has begun using internal tokens for an initiative in its Spanish and Argentinian branches to reward people who help train other employees or master new skills themselves.PayPal, which has been exploring blockchain for two years already, is also interested in crypto payments. In March, the company filed a patent in the U.S. describing the ways to speed up crypto transactions using secondary private keys. However, Peter Todd, a Bitcoin developer and cryptography consultant, later stated that it appeared PayPal was trying to patent a technology that had previously been developed by Bitcoin (BTC) hardware wallet Opendime."

At the time, the company’s Twitter account claimed the reason for the downtime was “maintenance.”The website subsequently went from claiming services would “be right back” to a generic error message Dec. 12. The website now shows a copy of their press release explaining the administration procedure.Some users reacted coldly, claiming they had already been waiting several weeks to withdraw funds.Opus Business, now in charge of Cubits’ administration, has not responded to a request for comment on users’ locked funds by press time.The February episode focuses on three Chinese traders who allegedly purchased Bitcoin (BTC) on Cubits via Malta-based payment processor Pay Secure Online Ltd, regularly known as PaySec.The company allegedly never paid Dooga the fiat due, leaving the company with debts totalling €35 million ($39.7 million). In August, a Maltese court upheld a garnishee order (third party order) filed against PaySec, which Dooga openly claims “colluded” with the traders.“Since February, Dooga has made every possible effort to recover these funds,” the release continued:“Unfortunately — contrary to expectations — these efforts have been unsuccessful up until now.”In a separate controversy, an analysis of Dooga’s activity on LinkedIn revealed its payments coordinator Eloise Debono is an endorser of infamous alleged ponzi scheme OneCoin.Opus Business, however, told Cointelegraph in private comments that Debono “worked for Cubits in a junior position for only a short period of 5 months. She was not with Cubits in February 2018 when the criminal act was committed.""Its head of crypto business, Max Krupyshev, left the company in November before its financial woes became public."

The project itself is designed to increase the efficiency of paper-based processes in an “agile working environment with a digital, audit-proof solution based on blockchain.”In the course of testing, workers created their digital identities in the uPort app on their smartphones, which they subsequently used to sign in and out of construction sites where they worked. The system confirmed workers’ presence at construction sites, as well as certified their training. A Linum Labs’ blog post Nov. 12 reads:“A self-sovereign blockchain based identity is well-suited for this use case because workers should be able to carry over their identity from one company to another and no specific company should own or manage it. In addition, there are multiple companies and parties issuing certificates.”Blockchain has been gaining traction in the transportation industry in the past months. In May, Swiss airport ground handling and cargo company Swissport announced it is launching a blockchain pilot program for its cargo handling business. Hendrik Leyssens, head of global cargo operations at Swissport, said that blockchain could speed up transactions, improve security and help reduce operational costs.In September, Lloyd's Register, a British tech and business maritime classification society, created a model of a blockchain-powered class register of ships.

The document summarized the 13th gathering of G-20 nations that took place on Nov. 30 and Dec. 1 in Buenos Aires, Argentina.The declaration addressed crypto regulation, albeit briefly: Cryptocurrencies are mentioned just once there, in the broader context of an “open and resilient financial system” that “is crucial to support sustainable growth.”While recognizing the importance of the cryptocurrency industry for the global economy, the G-20 also noted that it will introduce Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and anti-terrorist measures per standards of Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an intergovernmental body formed to fight money laundering and terrorist financing:“We will regulate crypto-assets for anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism in line with FATF standards and we will consider other responses as needed.”Further, in the same segment of the declaration, G-20 participants expressed a positive stance on non-bank financial institutions, pointing out the potential advantages of technology in the financial sector, given that the tech innovators are managing associated risks:“We look forward to continued progress on achieving resilient non-bank financial intermediation. We will step up efforts to ensure that the potential benefits of technology in the financial sector can be realized while risks are mitigated.”There is more crypto-related news coming from the international summit, however. On Dec. 2, Japanese news outlet Jiji reported that the G-20 countries have also called for the international taxation of cryptocurrency. According to the publication, the final text of a document cooperatively prepared by G-20 leaders outlines “a taxation system for cross-border electronic payment services.”The article specifies that — under current laws — foreign companies that do “not have a factory or other base in Japan” cannot be taxed by the local government, while the G-20 leaders seek to “build a taxation system for cross-border electronic services.”The Japanese news outlet also mentioned an estimated deadline for the system, saying that the final version of regulations, after considering proposals from each member state, is expected to be introduced by 2020. The issue will reportedly be discussed next year, when Japan will become the host of the summit and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzō Abe will take the position of G-20’s president.G-20 officials have previously maintained a ‘hands-off’ approach on crypto. In March 2018, after a call from France’s finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, the G-20 participants concluded the first public debate on virtual currencies.The meeting resulted with a “firm” July deadline that had been put forward for “very specific recommendations” on how to regulate cryptocurrencies globally, despite the Financial Stability Board (FSB) — the group which coordinates financial regulation for the G-20 economies — resisting calls from some G-20 members to discuss regulating cryptocurrencies at the conference.Moreover, many of the G-20 participants decided that cryptocurrencies needed to be examined further before making a concrete regulatory move, albeit some countries including Brazil stated that they won’t be following the G-20 recommendations.Nevertheless, the G-20 members agreed that the FATF would have its standards applied to the cryptocurrency markets in the respective countries, a position they recently reiterated in Buenos Aires:""We commit to implement the FATF standards as they apply to crypto-assets, look forward to the FATF review of those standards, and call on the FATF to advance global implementation. We call on international standard-setting bodies (SSBs) to continue their monitoring of crypto-assets and their risks, according to their mandates, and assess multilateral responses as needed.""In July, a summary of provisional decisions made by the dedicated Finance Ministers & Central Bank Governors said that “technological innovations, including those underlying cryptoassets [sic], can deliver significant benefits to the financial system and the broader economy.” Nevertheless, the document also listed various related problems, including tax evasion and AML concerns:“Crypto-assets do, however, raise issues with respect to consumer and investor protection, market integrity, tax evasion, money laundering and terrorist financing.”Still, the actual recommendations for how to approach the cryptocurrency sphere at the international level were not presented, and the deadline was pushed to October 2018:“[W]e ask the FATF to clarify in October 2018 how its standards apply to crypto-assets,” the summary read. It is unclear if those recommendations have been presented to date, as there has been no information from the G-20 regarding that issue.On Oct. 22, as the G-20 remained silent, Jeremy Allaire, the CEO of the Goldman Sachs-backed crypto investment app Circle, stated that crypto-related regulatory matters have to be addressed “at the G20 level.” Prior to that, on Oct. 19, the FATF said that by June 2019, jurisdictions will be obliged to license or regulate cryptocurrency exchanges and some firms providing encrypted wallets internationally as part of AML and anti-terrorism procedures.  In separate news regarding international adoption and regulation of crypto technology, on Dec. 4, seven southern EU countries — including France, Italy, Spain and Malta — formed an alliance called the “Mediterranean seven” with the aim to promote the use of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) among governments, as per Financial Times. The EU, as well as Italy and France, are members of the G-20 alliance.More specifically, the EU countries have reportedly signed a declaration stating that areas like “education, transport, mobility, shipping, land registry, customs, company registry, and healthcare” can be “transformed” and boosted with the use of DLT.“This can result not only in the enhancement of e-government services but also increased transparency and reduced administrative burdens, better customs collection and better access to public information,” the declaration reportedly states."

Crypto Platform ...","Dec 7, 2018","Two new bills focusing on cryptocurrency market manipulation aim to “position the United States to be a leader in the cryptocurrency industry,” their sponsors claimed Dec. 6.","The bills, dubbed “The Virtual Currency Consumer Protection Act of 2018” and “The U.S. Virtual Currency Market and Regulatory Competitiveness Act of 2018” will go before the House of Representatives having been compiled in mid-November.A bipartisan effort, their authors, congressmen Darren Soto and Ted Budd, said they wish to “provide data on how Congress can best mitigate these risks while propelling development that benefits our economy.”“Virtual currencies and the underlying blockchain technology has a profound potential to be a driver of economic growth,” they said in a joint statement.“That’s why we must ensure that the United States is at the forefront of protecting consumers and the financial well-being of virtual currency investors, while also promoting an environment of innovation to maximize the potential of these technological advances.”The plans come as the U.S. sees continued growing pains in its journey to regulate cryptocurrency markets.As Cointelegraph reported Friday, a new academic report has highlighted “overlapping” jurisdiction of agencies as contributing to the U.S.’ lack of appeal for industry businesses and consumers alike.Cryptocurrency exchanges in particular have taken specific action to protect themselves from exposure by setting up offshore operations.Soto and Budd correspondingly seek to broaden the basis for domestic regulation by looking beyond borders, their second bill advocating a “comparative study of the regulation of virtual currency in other countries” in order to “make recommendations for regulatory changes to promote competitiveness.”Wall Street has already focused on market manipulation control meanwhile, Nasdaq in October claiming its financial instruments could help mitigate the practice."

compensation through Ethereum or Bitcoin, and additional coins ...","Nov 29, 2018","A company has released the beta version of its cryptocurrency mining platform – the first iteration of “simple to setup, highly automated” software that is aimed to appeal to newbies and seasoned professionals alike.","Cudo Miner says its offering is a GUI miner, which in other words is a graphic frontend for its interface. Its accessible technology means “inexperienced miners can install and sit back while the software automates everything else,” while experts have the chance to adjust advanced settings in line with their preferences.The program is able to mine multiple coins and switch between them based on which one is the most profitable at any given moment. Casual miners can leave Cudo Miner working in the background while they use their PC, ensuring that it does not interfere with their computer’s performance. Crypto enthusiasts with dedicated mining rigs can maximize earnings by tweaking algorithms on the “advanced settings” page, where they can also see the results of all their benchmarks. Automatic overclocking and other features designed to boost profitability are being released by the end of the year, aiming to bridge the gap between traditional command line and GUI miners.These features are reinforced by a dashboard where miners can examine data related to their mining performance, look at historic earnings, view hardware information and power levels, as well as keep a close eye on the health of their devices.Cudo Miner users also have a choice in how they get paid – they can receive compensation through Ethereum or Bitcoin, and additional coins will be included to the list in the future.The company says that its simplified approach to mining has struck a chord with crypto enthusiasts. Since launching a month ago, Cudo says that its software has attracted thousands of users in more than 130 countries. Available on Windows, Mac and Linux, the program updates automatically and makes the necessary changes as forks arise.Overall, the crypto mining world has been suffering a crisis of confidence over the past few months – but with Bitcoin miners alone already generating $4.7 billion in revenue for the first nine months of 2018, there is still a lot to play for.Cudo Miner ardently believes that “GPU mining is definitely alive and kicking,” but its team argue that the strategies being adopted by some professional miners are diminishing their chances of making a decent profit. Altcoins are often the most profitable only for a few minutes or hours, so one needs to mine during this period to maximize gain. They say the emphasis needs to move away from focusing on a single coin or algorithm in favor of chopping and changing between an array of cryptocurrencies as well as choosing optimal settings – elevating their chances of making it worthwhile.The company’s founders were motivated to find an accessible mining solution when they discovered “the huge amounts of computing power on laptops, PCs and servers” – with hardware often idle 60 percent of the time. As a result, they sought to develop a solution that kills two birds with one stone: stopping resources from being wasted while maximizing profitability from mining by removing barriers to entry.Of course, utilizing underused resources doesn’t detract from the fact that there are concerns about the energy consumption that goes into cryptocurrency mining, with a recent report suggesting that it takes more energy to produce $1 of Bitcoin than it does to uncover a dollar worth of gold or silver.Cudo says it is the first crypto mining company to commit to being carbon neutral – as well as making an active effort to get its users to follow suit.The company offsets its energy consumption by investing in carbon credits that aim to help good causes – delivering funding to solar and wind power projects in India which deliver renewable energy to the national grid. Miners will soon be able to select options that make their own hardware carbon neutral, too.Over time, Cudo believes distributed computing has the potential to help a number of good causes, including cancer research, protein folding and seismic imaging.Within Cudo Miner, users can choose to mine anonymously in order to test the software without logging in. The revenue received goes to charity. It has also established a charitable arm called Cudo Donate, where miners can convert their spare computing power into cash for good causes. This project has the goal of raising $1 billion in funding and computing resources for charities in the coming years.Cudo was founded by CEO Matt Hawkins and by Duncan Cook, and both men have been motivated by a desire to do something philanthropic. Cook has experience in building technology for good causes, and one of his projects was a disaster warning app for the American Red Cross, which has helped to save countless lives during natural disasters.Disclaimer.

The bank is responsible for developing the Russian economy, as well as managing Russia’s state debts and pension funds.Other Russian banks have also shown an interest in blockchain technology.Recently, major Russian state-backed bank Sberbank conducted an over-the-counter (OTC) monetary repurchase agreement based on blockchain technology. And earlier in November, the Russian branch of Raiffeisen Bank International teamed up with local state oil giant Gazprom Neft to issue a blockchain-enabled bank guarantee."

Crypto Market Trading — Inside ...","Nov 21, 2018","Authorities in the U.S. state of California have arrested a 21-year old New Yorker for the alleged theft of $1 million in crypto using “SIM-swapping,” U.S. broadsheet the New York Post reported Nov. 20.","SIM-swapping — also known as a “port-out scam” — involves the theft of a cell phone number in order to hijack online financial and social media accounts, enabled by the fact that many firms  use automated messages or phone calls to handle customer authentication.The arrested suspect, Nicholas Truglia, is accused of having targeted wealthy Silicon Valley executives in the Bay Area, and of successfully persuading telecoms support staff to port six victims numbers to his an alleged “crew” of accomplice attackers. Deputy DA Erin West, of Santa Clara Superior Court, told the Post the ruse was “a new way of doing an old crime.”Truglia had previously made headlines in September, when he alerted police claiming to have been the victim of violent attempts by four of his friends to rob him of hardware that would enable them to swipe $1.2 million worth of his crypto holdings.One of Truglia’s alleged SIM-swapping victims, San Francisco-based Robert Ross, was allegedly robbed of $500,000 worth of crypto holdings on his Coinbase wallet “in seconds” on Oct. 26, and at the same time a further $500,000 was taken from his Gemini account. West said the $1,000,000 was Ross’ “life savings” and his two daughters’ college fund.While Ross was allegedly the only victim of the six targets from which Truglia managed to siphon crypto, he is accused of successfully taking control of the phones belonging to Saswata Basu, CEO of the blockchain storage firm 0Chain; Myles Danielsen, vice president of Hall Capital Partners, and Gabrielle Katsnelson, co-founder of startup SMBX.The California authorities reportedly flew to New York City Nov. 14 to arrest the suspect at his apartment, recovering a hardware wallet and $300,000 of stolen funds. West told the post, “the takeaway here to the hackers is, ‘We don’t care where you’re located, we are a task force based in Silicon Valley, and our reach is nationwide.”Truglia is since being held Manhattan Detention Complex pending extradition to Santa Clara in California. Formal charges relate to a seven-day “hacking spree” beginning Oct. 8, specifically entailing “grand theft, altering or damaging computer data with the intent to defraud and using personal information without authorization.”As recently reported, the rising prevalence of SIM swap-related incidents has prompted a California-based law enforcement group to make it their “highest priority.” In more than one high-profile instance, victims have acted to sue telecoms firms such as AT&T and T-Mobile for their facilitation of the crime."
93,https://cointelegraph.com,"Dec 6, 2018",Inside Chilean Power Battle: Crypto Exchanges vs. State Banks,https://cointelegraph.com/news/inside-chilean-power-battle-crypto-exchanges-vs-state-banks,"The legal framework for crypto, if introduced, could side with crypto 
exchanges or stand with the banks. #Government · #Banks · #Bitcoin ...","Dec 6, 2018","On Monday, Dec. 4, the Chilean Supreme Court welcomed the decision of state-owned Banco del Estado to close the accounts of local cryptocurrency exchange Orionx. The new phase in the legal battle between the banks and several crypto exchanges — including Buda.com and CryptoMarket (CryptoMKT), which had appealed against the denial of services — may look somewhat sinister from the outside. But the main players of the Chilean crypto market assured Cointelegraph that the recent decision could not prevent them from operating in the country.","In March, two crypto exchanges — Buda and CryptoMKT — came out with a joint statement, claiming that some banks in Chile had closed their accounts. “We are killing the whole industry long before exploring it and understanding its approach,” the release read. CryptoMKT also claimed that another bank received instructions not to deal with anyone who is related to cryptocurrencies. Both crypto businesses then urged the Chilean Association of Banks (ABIF), which coordinates all the private and foreign financial institutions in the country, to intervene — or at least clear up its stance on cryptocurrencies.A response was given within a few days of the statement: The president of ABIF, Segismundo Schulin-Zeuthen, told Chilean business outlet Diario Financiero that the banks were free to moderate relations with their clients. Schulin-Zeuthen also criticized Buda and CryptoMKT for “[generating] false judgments about the institutional role of the ABIF,” while the association’s role consisted of discussing and analyzing existing regulation in the finance sector.The bank that closed the crypto exchanges’ accounts was soon revealed to be Itau Corpbanca, the fifth-largest bank in Chile, along with a branch of Latin American banking giant Itau Unibanco and Scotiabank Chile, a branch of a Canadian banking group by the same name. They were soon joined by Banco del Estado — the only public bank in the country managing up to $52 billion in assets, as of 2017.Later in April, Itau Corpbanca opposed the crypto industry’s stance that the move was illegal and insisted that the closure of accounts result in an internal investigation. According to Itau, Buda had failed to comply with their Anti-Money Laundering (AML) policy. Moreover, the bank accused the exchange of failing to verify the users’ data, as Buda’s website only requested basic information during the registration and did not verify the identities of its clients.The whole story, including the media coverage and official responses, fueled a huge backlash on social media. As Cointelegraph reported in April 2018, crypto enthusiasts blamed financial institutions for “a huge negative blow to Chile's reputation as a rational, innovation-friendly, free market economy,” stating that those actions “stifle innovation.” Twitter users created a hashtag #ChileQuiereCrypto (Chile wants crypto), urging the government to resolve the problem with crypto exchanges.In mid-April, the Chilean crypto exchanges decided to fight for their rights and started a legal battle, applying to Tribunal de Defensa de la Libre Competencia (TDLC) — an independent, anti-monopoly institution established to ensure that free competition rules are not violated. Buda and CryptoMkt, joined by Orionx (whose accounts had also been closed), had filed a petition against several banks, including Itau Corpbanca, Scotiabank and Banco del Estado.Guillermo Torrealba, Buda’s co-founder and CEO, summed up the whole turmoil in an comment for Cointelegraph:“There hasn't been one regulator, legislator or government official saying that cryptocurrencies aren’t legal, it was just the decision of a very powerful sector of the economy: the banking industry.”Only a few weeks after the first complaint, TDLC ruled against Banco del Estado and Itau Corpbanca, forcing them to re-open Buda’s accounts.Later in June, the same decision was made in favor of Orionx. As the company wrote on its official Facebook page, the anti-monopoly court ordered Banco del Estado and Banco de Chile — another major bank in the country that was mentioned in the initial lawsuit — to reopen Orionx’s accounts within three days.It would be logical to assume that the long-term battle would force Chilean authorities to introduce relevant legislation on cryptocurrencies to prevent such situations in the future.In late March, following the first news of the closure of the crypto accounts, Diario Financiero spoke to Chile’s Minister of Finance Felipe Larrain. He was reassured that both the Ministry and the Central Bank of Chile had started exploring the possibility of crypto regulation to normalize the situation:“Technical progress and the digital economy bring people new services; we have to consider this fact. But when the regulation issues arise [...], we have to avoid situations that could affect the normal development of markets and healthy competition.”Chile’s central bank reaffirmed that intention in May. Mario Marcel, the president of the institution, proposed incorporating the crypto regulation in order “to allow having a registry of participants in these activities and thus have information to monitor the associated risks.” Marcel also stated that the industry needed more transparency and consumer protection — as cryptocurrencies could possibly be involved in illicit activities, such as money laundering and the financing of terrorists.Six months after the recent claim, there is still no sign of a legal framework for cryptocurrencies in Chile. In October, local deputies instead introduced a resolution on blockchain adoption to the lower house of the country’s parliament. Miguel Angel Calisto and Giorgio Jackson — along with eight other MPs — urged Chile’s President Sebastian Pinera to implement blockchain in all the country’s public areas, along with carrying out studies on the advantages of decentralized security and energy solutions.A new, unexpected chapter began on Dec. 4, when the Chilean Supreme Court published its resolution in favor of Banco del Estado. As cited by major Chilean newspaper El Mercurio, the document reads:""The resolution taken July 11, 2018, is revoked. It is declared in its place that the protection appeal filed by Orionx SPA against the Banco del Estado is rejected.""The Supreme Court further explained that the actions conducted by Banco del Estado were not “unjustified” or “illegal,” as the bank acted correctly and did not violate any rules of the Chilean constitution. Moreover, the top court stated that the cryptocurrencies “have no physical manifestation and no intrinsic value.” The document also proclaimed that they are controlled neither by a government nor by a corporation, citing the characteristics of crypto as reasons for letting banks refuse services to the exchange.Despite the apparent harshness of the Supreme Court’s decision, Chilean crypto exchanges believe it will have no bearing on the case. Reacting to the aforementioned resolution, Orionx published a statement on their official Facebook page:“Orionx wants to clarify that this ruling does not imply the closure of the company’s current bank accounts. [D]ue to the fact there is a current precautionary measure issued by TDLC, which prevents banks from closing the mentioned accounts.”Moreover, Orionx emphasizes that it disagrees with the arguments provided by the Supreme Court and regrets the latest ruling.Buda shares the same stance, also citing the ruling of the anti-monopoly court in its official statement:“The valid ruling in our favor pronounced by TDLC assures that our bank accounts will be maintained during the trial that is held in the mentioned court.”Moreover, the firm insists that the Supreme Court’s resolution on Orionx has nothing to do with their company. Speaking to Cointelegraph, Buda’s co-founder Agustin Feuerhake said:“The situation with Buda.com has been slightly different. Since [the] very beginning[,] we had a relevant KYC [Know Your Customer] policy. We also tackle money laundering and terrorism financing, so the bank's argument to close an account does not apply to our case. There are no anonymous users on Buda.com.”Feuerhake further added that the Chilean courts are not evaluating the ban on crypto exchanges, but rather seek ways to “condemn banks for abusive behavior” toward them.As the decision of the Supreme Court did not mention Buda and CryptoMKT, it might be a turning point in the plot. The legal framework for crypto, if introduced, could side with crypto exchanges or stand with the banks."

Blockchain ...","Dec 12, 2018",,"This article has been updated to reflect comments from Ran Neuner on his involvement in the project.The man behind the “Blockchain Terminal” (BCT) initial coin offering (ICO) has reportedly been outed as a financial criminal who concealed his former identity from employees and investors, according to crypto news outlet The Block. An investigation into the circumstances was published Dec. 11.The BCT project and its affiliated firm, CG Blockchain, are alleged to have raised as much as $31 million in an ICO to launch a crypto-focused version of the ubiquitous Bloomberg Terminal — a highly successful financial data and trading tool for the financial sector.According to The Block, BCT’s glossy “institutional-grade” tool for crypto “trading professionals” had at its helm a man who operated as “Shaun MacDonald,” but was allegedly a convicted fraudster, Boaz Manor. Manor received a four-year prison sentence in Canada in 2012 for siphoning $106 million from a Toronto-based hedge fund that he co-founded, according to Toronto news daily, The Star.The Canadian fund reportedly had $800 million in assets under management at its peak from 26,000 investors. In April 2018, The Globe and Mail reported that Manor agreed to repay nearly $6.6 million to make up for missing diamonds from the fund. At the time, Manor reportedly said that he does not know where the diamonds are located.The Globe and Mail further states that Manor agreed to a lifetime ban from the securities industry, after which he supposedly withheld his conviction and identity from his colleagues at BCT. Manor went so far as “growing a beard and [dying] his hair red,” according to The Block. While formally assigning the company’s presidency to Bob Bonomo — former chief information officer at $500 billion asset management firm AllianceBernstein — MacDonald was reportedly the primary driver behind the BCT venture.Although it marketed its $999 “Blockchain Terminal” to crypto hedge funds — a 32-inch HD terminal with a hardware private key — the company is alleged to have raised most of its funds via a lucrative $31 million ICO for its native BCT token, which launched in September 2017.One of the project’s purported investors is the high-profile crypto analyst and host of CNBC’s show Cryptotrader Ran Neuner, who tweeted his endorsement of the Blockchain Terminal in June, and is alleged to have invested as much as $1.3 million in the company’s ICO, according to two unnamed sources.Neuner yesterday stated he had “lost a ton” of his own cash investing in the BCT “fraud,” but accused The Block of “defamatory” misreporting, and falsely claiming to have reached out to contact him for comment on the story.When reached for comment, Neuner clarified to Cointelegraph that he invested around $300,000 — not $1.3 million — in the BCT project. He explained over email that he “at one point [...] advised the company, specifically about how to infiltrate the crypto market,” noting that he assisted in finding “high volume traders” to test the screens.However, Neuner continued, after receiving a “tip off” in the early fall that MacDonald was actually Boaz Manor, he confronted him without receiving confirmation. Neuner added:“Due to the suspicion [I] resigned immediately from the advisory and have been working with a bunch of other investors ever since to gather enough credible information to go to the authorities and report the project.My investigation is ongoing.”Besides MacDonald’s misrepresentations, the Block reports that Bonomo “quietly resigned” from BCT this summer, after which MacDonald supposedly revealed himself as Manor to his employees, and purportedly ceased to pay them. With Manor’s whereabouts “unclear,” BCT has now rebranded as BCT Inc., and announced in late October that its Terminal would go on sale to the public.In June, the Bloomberg Terminal announced that it would begin listing crypto exchange Huobi's Cryptocurrency Index, as well as nine crypto-trading pairs."

The article notes:“If the FSS considers that the content is insufficient, the FSS will be able to impose more direct sanctions in the future.”In addition, the article states that there is a problem with the so-called “suspicious transaction extraction standard of Kookmin Bank's virtual currency handling business.”The FSS has also asked the National Agricultural Cooperative Federation (NACF), which owns Nonghyup Bank, to improve the related system so that suspicious transaction extraction criteria can be applied to all dealers, including the virtual currency counterparts that have not signed a real-name verification service contract with the NACF.At the beginning of this year, the FSS and the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) inspected six of the country’s major banks, including Kookmin Bank and Nonghyup Bank, to decide whether the institutions “carried out their obligations to prevent money laundering in managing virtual accounts.”Also in January, South Korean financial authorities created a task force to oversee and inspect cryptocurrency exchanges’ compliance with the existing regulations.This spring, three domestic banks, including Kookmin and Nonghyup, were inspected again by the the Financial Services Commission (FSC) to ensure the banks were conforming to new anti-anonymity regulations.Following the inspection, the FSC released revised Anti-Money Laundering (AML) guidelines for virtual currencies to ensure that there were no suspicious transactions and payment processing, Cointelegraph wrote Jun. 28."

Sedaily reports that Presto’s CEO and founder, Kang Kyung-Won declared that the startup has “been hitting a snag as the government and the National Assembly have done nothing over the last one year since the government’s blanket ban on ICOs.”He then announced their intention to file a constitutional appeal:“We will ask the court to rule on the ICO ban and the legislature’s nonfeasance.”Sedaily explains that according to Presto, the ban infringes on “people’s freedom of occupation and property and equal rights and scientist’s basic rights.” Kyung-Won said that given the fast pace of technological development that came with the fourth industrial revolution, “such unconstitutional and pre-modern measures as the ICO ban should not exist any longer.”South Korea’s stance to crypto regulation stands in clear contrast with other countries like Malta. As Cointelegraph reported in July, Malta has been acclaimed as “the blockchain island” after the local parliament approved three bills that gave the crypto industry unprecedented legal clarity.The Maltese government is also reportedly working on an artificial intelligence (AI) strategy of which the ultimate objective is to “explore a citizenship test for robots in the process of drafting new regulation for AI.”That being said, South Korea recently overtook the Maltese crypto exchanges daily trading volume in November according to a CryptoCompare report.

He stated that, as scalability advances (driving fees down) and user experience (UX) gets better, non-financial applications will become “a bigger part of the story.”He further noted that blockchains are not about “cutting computational costs,” but are instead about increasing computational costs while decreasing “social costs.” Buternin stated that computers have become 1 trillion times cheaper per unit computation in the last 70 years while human labor has gotten anywhere from two to 10 times more expensive.Buterin added that “incurring high technical costs to achieve reductions in social costs is at least sometimes a very good bargain.” Then he addressed future scalability:9. Blockchains of the future with proof of stake and sharding will be thousands of times more efficient, and so the efficiency sacrifices of putting things on a chain will become more and more acceptable.On their road to implementing PoS, Ethereum developers are adopting Casper — a hybrid of PoS and proof-of-work (PoW) that Buterin calls “the friendly ghost” after the eponymous animated children’s show.As Cointelegraph previously reported, Casper is expected to help solve excessive energy consumption and “issues with equal access to mining hardware, mining pool centralization, and an emerging market of ASICs.” Alongside sharding, PoS is intended to be Ethereum’s on-chain scaling solution.Environmental concerns over the mining of Bitcoin (BTC) and other PoW-based cryptocurrencies have steadily increased with their rise in popularity. In October last year, the energy consumption of Bitcoin mining was estimated to be 288 megawatts. In comparison, proof-of-stake is reportedly much more energy efficient, making it a potential solution to crypto mining’s energy woes."

The classification would arguably decrease the number of potential buyers for said tokens, and thereby disrupt Basis’ stablecoin model.Al-Naji stated that the current regulatory approach to tokens that classifies many of them as securities is “onerous for anyone trying to build a decentralized network.” The CEO stated:“At its core the decentralized nature of most cryptos is fundamentally incompatible with them being securities.”Basis raised $133 million in funding from high-profile investors, including Andreessen Horowitz and Bain Capital Ventures, back in April 2018.Launched in 2017, the crypto startup tweeted today to thank its supporters and investors:“We owe our sincere thanks to everyone who supported us in our mission to create a better monetary system. Until next time.”The stablecoin market has seen an immense wave of adoption this year, with November alone reportedly showing a massive 1,032 growth in on-chain transactions compared to September. According to Bloomberg, the crypto industry has seen 120 developing stablecoin projects over the year, with some of them, similarly to Basis, implementing secondary tokens. These include firms such as MakerDAO and Reserve, that latter’s co-founder and CEO Nevin Freeman confirming that both projects “don’t need to use security tokens to buy up stablecoins,” in comments to Cointelegraph.Earlier today, Cointelegraph reported that MakerDAO’s governance token Maker (MKR) has surged by more than 32 percent over the past 24 hours to press time, pushing the coin into the ranks of CoinMarketCap’s top 20 coins.Also today, Cointelegraph reported that U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin Paxos Standard (PAX) has exceeded $5 billion worth of transaction volumes over the first three months after its launch in September."

Public equities aren't exactly at their all time highs either.""In order to justify his firm’s bet, the investor has also reportedly pointed to recent losses suffered by FANG –– a group of high-performing tech stocks in the U.S. market, namely Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google. Facebook is currently down 24 percent percent loss year over year, as CNBC reports.Pompliano made a similar observation about the performance of traditional stocks in a tweet last month, stating that FANG stocks were down 20-40 percent from their all-time highs, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DOW) had its “worst Thanksgiving week since 2011.”Buffett himself has come out multiple times to provocatively criticize cryptocurrency, calling it everything from a “mirage” to “rat poison squared.”"

Mayweather will pay $300,000 in disgorgement, a $300,000 penalty, and $14,775 in prejudgment interest. Khaled will pay $50,000 in disgorgement, a $100,000 penalty, and $2,725 in prejudgment interest.Moreover, Mayweather agreed to collaborate with the investigation and not to promote any kind of securities during the next three years. Khaled has been barred from securities promotion for two years. SEC Enforcement Division Co-Director Steven Peikin commented on the issue:""Investors should be skeptical of investment advice posted to social media platforms, and should not make decisions based on celebrity endorsements. Social media influencers are often paid promoters, not investment professionals, and the securities they’re touting, regardless of whether they are issued using traditional certificates or on the blockchain, could be frauds.""Mayweather began promoting Centra’s ICO in September 2017, claiming that he was already using his Titanium Centra card to use digital currencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) in his business transactions. At that time, Centra’s ICO was the third ICO being promoted by Mayweather.Just a few weeks later, Khaled joined Mayweather in promoting Centra’s ICO by making public his acquisition of a Titanium Centra Card on his Instagram account.Later in November 2017, the SEC warned that ICOs  that were endorsed by celebrities could be illegal. The commission claimed that personalities who promote token sales could be violating the “anti-touting” laws if they do not reveal the compensation they received from their endorsements."

Over ...","Nov 27, 2018",An established digital asset exchange has announced it is holding a summit in Singapore to explore new opportunities in the marketplace – creating a platform where crypto enthusiasts can detect industry trends and debate what the future holds after a volatile year.,"Bibox, an exchange enhanced by artificial intelligence (AI,) is hosting a summit on Nov 29, and hopes the event will give investors an insight into the strategic changes that lie ahead in 2019.The company says that token bonds are likely to take center stage at the day-long conference, amid questions over whether they could become a new, widespread investment opportunity. It is reported that ICO crowdsales have lost momentum in recent months – prompting entrepreneurs to find new ways to connect with investors.Following a year of dizzying highs and lows, Bibox also says demand for fixed-income assets is on the rise, leading to rising interest around token bonds. This will be another topic that’s discussed at length – with a panel convening for an hour-long discussion on the impact these financial instruments may have on the blockchain industry.Token bonds are a modern take on bonds, one of the oldest financial instruments in the world. In a way, they are a form of debt and they enable blockchain-based businesses to raise money. Bond holders normally receive a sum of money when they mature, along with regular interest payments over the bond’s lifespan. These assets can be traded, and their price can fluctuate.Two other panel discussions are planned. One will offer Singapore’s perspective on token bonds, while the other will explore the role of institutional investors and market makers in the secondary market. Representatives from Bibox are going to give a presentation to kick off proceedings, with delegates from Vocean, a decentralized crypto financial ecosystem, to follow.The conference comes hot on the heels of two big milestones: Bitcoin’s 10th birthday, and Bibox’s first anniversary.Over the first 12 months of operation, the exchange says it has opened offices in seven countries. It has also launched the BiboxLab, an “international blockchain hub” based in New York which aims to support top-tier projects with funding, consulting services, technical guidance, legal counsel, marketing, office space and media management.BiboxLab’s goal is to uncover practical projects that innovate and provide “disruptive solutions to existing pain points” while embracing compliance and regulation. Vocean, mentioned earlier, is one of the first participants. The ecosystem enables fixed-income products such as loans, bonds and derivatives to be issued and traded. Additionally, it can provide blockchain projects with credit ratings and unlock new ways for them to raise funds.Bibox is also going to launch a European fiat exchange early next year, supporting fiat currencies including the Swiss franc, British pound and the euro. The platform will also reportedly allow contract trading in the future.In a year, Bibox says it has managed to amass more than 2,000,000 registered users – and according to CoinMarketCap it is the eighth-largest exchange in terms of daily trading volume, which at the time of writing stood at more than $290 million.Executives from the company wrote a letter of thanks to users, marking the anniversary by stating: “Bibox is planning to launch a series of derivatives so as to meet the diversified needs of investors, striving to become a one-stop transparent and smart assets management platform, and we do hope you, as always, to continue supporting us in the years to come.”The Bibox exchange is available to download from Apple’s App Store and Google Play for Android devices, and software has also been released for Windows PCs and Macs. Five languages are currently supported: English, Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese, and Russian.Bibox’s Bond Summit – dubbed 2019 New Opportunities for Digital Assets – is being held at the Suntec Singapore Convention and Exhibition Center, and runs from 10 am to 5 pm.Disclaimer.

Blocko supports, develops, and subsequently plans to use the AERGO platform to offer a broader set of enterprise-IT solutions and cloud-based application development capabilities to many existing blockchain clients.AERGO is an end-to-end open-source based platform that features customizable high-scale hybrid-blockchain deployments, a serverless cloud architecture, and data bridging technology. The company was founded by Blocko’s leadership team consisting of enterprise-IT and blockchain veterans. AERGO’s architecture will allow enterprises to transfer data without having to trust an intermediary while also being flexibly governed and integrated seamlessly into existing systems.AERGO will use the funds to develop the AERGO platform. This includes:Releasing a new base-layer public blockchain protocolDelivering a set of easy-to-use IT integration software deployment blueprintsScaling-out its research and development teamsLaunching new applications on the platform to demonstrate use casesExpanding its partner ecosystem and global reachThe AERGO organization has raised $30 million in funds to build a public blockchain platform that incorporates insights Blocko has gained from delivering 23 private blockchain products to enterprises, fintech companies, and government bodies since 2014.The funding round included Sequoia Capital China, GBIC, Neo Global Capital, Dekrypt Capital, FBG Capital, Arrington XRP Capital, JRR Crypto, Rockaway Capital, Block Crafters Capital, and more.“I’ve spent over twenty-five years leading firms like Red Hat and VMWare in driving adoption of open-source technologies by delivering complex systems to corporations like Deutsche Telekom, HSBC, Ferrari, Sony, Ericsson, and Siemens,” said Phil Zamani, Founder and Chairman of the AERGO organization. “Blocko’s approach to the next frontier of open-source technology, blockchain, will emulate that which I made when leading business strategies in firms like Red Hat, where innate customer know-how, which Blocko has, was the edge over competitors like IBM.”Mr. Zamani believes the success of the funding round is credited to the open-source enterprise-IT leadership experience he holds and the four years of practical blockchain implementation experience Blocko holds having delivered many in-production systems to clients including Korea Exchange, Samsung Card, Lotte Card, a South Korean government body (and more). Blocko’s services became increasingly demanded by large companies after Samsung first made an investment in the company in 2016.AERGO takes a hybrid blockchain approach to its design architecture which entails a mix of a public chain, private chains, and side chains all connected through interoperability technology. AERGO claims a hybrid approach should allow ease of integration into existing systems by giving businesses the flexibility of coupling completely trustless environments for sensitive data or value transfers with regulatory compliant record-keeping, privacy, and customization.“Many of the newer blockchain solutions are still not suited for enterprises and existing businesses. AERGO has the greatest potential to bring blockchain technology closer to the real world as it is leveraging Blocko’s core technology which has dozens of production-level projects with millions of end-users,” said Sinhae Lee, Partner at GBIC, in a statement. “The team has been focusing on blockchain technology since 2014 and has been providing its blockchain product, Coinstack, to some of the largest conglomerates including Samsung Card, Hyundai, and Kia Motors.”Roger Lim, Partner at Neo Global Capital, the investment arm of China’s blockchain platform NEO, added, “There are three things needed for a platform to be successful: great technology, a strong team, and a proven track record to deliver on a disruptive vision. The team’s extensive experience in delivering blockchain implementations stands out and fulfills these requirements. We look forward to working with AERGO to help them to deliver a platform for decentralized applications running on the blockchain.”The startup previously raised USD 8.9 M in a Series-B round in June of this year which included a follow-on investment from Samsung Ventures from a previous funding round.Won Beom-Kim - Founder and Chief ScientistPhil Zamani - Chairman & CEOHunyoung Park - CTO & Board MemberAERGO is an open platform that allows businesses to build innovative applications and services by sharing data on a trustless and distributed IT ecosystem.

The product was reportedly “difficult to configure” and during the “substantial amount of time” that lapsed before he could fully initialize his devices, they operated at cost-intensive “full power mode,” at his expense.The filing states that “the ASIC devices were mining crypto currency from the moment Plaintiff started the device and it would transfer any electronic crypto currency mined to Defendant.” This allegedly continued until the devices were associated with Gevorkyan’s personal account.The lawsuit thus accuses the company of engaging in “an unfair business practice,” and of having “unjustly enriched” the firm by converting the use of its customers’ ASIC devices and electricity, thereby causing “ascertainable and out-of-pocket losses.”Gevorkyan is seeking damages in excess of $5 million on behalf of all miners “similarly situated” as Bitmain clients.The lawsuit comes at an eventful time for the mining titan; its China-produced mining rigs are likely to be affected by recently imposed U.S. sanctions on Chinese goods; something that would be particularly burdensome, as according to the company’s pre-Initial Public Offering (IPO) prospectus, foreign sales accounted for 51.8 percent of its total revenue in 2017.On the eve of its IPO — which aims to raise anything from $3 billion to $18 billion — Bitmain has become mired in a series of difficulties.As the fallout from the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) hard fork continues, the hardware manufacturer could face serious losses after having invested a significant amount of its funds in the asset. Moreover, the company’s pre-IPO triggered controversy as alleged participants, such as SoftBank, Termasek and the Chinese IT-giant behind WeChat, Tencent, officially denied their participation."

The development was reported by English-language local broadsheet The Straits Times Nov. 19.","The new Payment Services Bill (PSB), submitted by MAS board member and education minister Ong Ye Kung before parliament, is set to replace two existing pieces of legislation, the Payment Systems (Oversight) Act (PS(O)A) and the Money-Changing and Remittance Businesses Act (MCRBA).The new bill, which has passed through two public consultations since August 2016, has reportedly been drafted to better safeguard consumer funds, counter terrorism financing, and bolster cybersecurity. In the cryptocurrency space, it is expected to affect e-wallets and digital payment tokens such as GrabPay, Bitcoin (BTC), and Ethereum (ETH). Both PS(O)A and MCRBA will be repealed when the new, streamlined PSB comes into force at the end of 2019.The MAS has clarified that PSB comprises two parallel frameworks, the first being a “designation regime” that enables the central bank to name and thereby bring payment systems it considers “crucial to financial stability” under its oversight. The second entails a mandatory licensing regime for payment service providers, who will be required to apply for one of three licenses based on the nature and scope of their activities.The first license, for “money-changers,” regulates providers primarily for money laundering and terrorism financing risks; a more comprehensive “standard payment institution license” is available for entities that transact over $3 million per month, provided they hold a digital money float of no more than $5 million. A “major payment institution,” the most rigorously regulated tier of license, is available for larger service providers.The central bank has given digital token payment service providers six months after the PSB comes into force to comply with the new regime; non-crypto payment providers will have up to twelve.This October, MAS managing director Ravi Menon commented on the need to improve banking support for crypto-related businesses. While conceding that some “opaque” activities within the cryptocurrency space pose particular challenges, he hinted that financial institutions should be encouraged to adapt their existing practices to cooperate with the emerging sector."

Warren Davidson (R) has announced plans to introduce legislation that would clearly regulate cryptocurrencies and Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), local Ohio news agency Cleveland.com reports Dec. 3.According to Cleveland.com, Davidson announced his intention to introduce new legislation at the Blockchain Solutions conference. The bill would create an “asset class” for cryptocurrencies and digital assets, which “would prevent them from being classified as securities, but would also allow the federal government to regulate initial coin offerings more effectively.”This development would bring clarity to U.S. crypto regulation. Currently, state regulatory agencies classify tokens differently, in ways that place them under their jurisdiction.The Securities and Exchanges Commission’s (SEC) stance is that most cryptocurrencies are securities. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), on the other hand, treats cryptocurrencies as commodities.In other words, the CFTC states that Bitcoin (BTC) has more in common with gold than with currencies or securities since it is not backed by a government and does not have liabilities attached to it. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FINCEN), the agency managing Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) standards, views crypto as money.The U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), which enforces economic sanctions, views crypto as money and blacklists wallets of sanctioned persons. Lastly, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) treats cryptocurrencies as property, meaning that profits from selling them are subject to capital gains tax.A group of U.S. congressional representatives sent a letter in September to SEC Chairman Jay Clayton, calling for “clearer guidelines between those digital tokens that are securities, and those that are not.”The same month, over 45 representatives of major crypto companies and Wall Street firms attended a congressional roundtable discussion on cryptocurrency and ICO regulation. During meeting, which was hosted by Davidson, experts expressed concerns about a lack of regulatory clarity in the industry and discussed “token taxonomy.”Davidson has previously demonstrated his support for the crypto industry, suggesting that the ICO market needs “light touch” regulation. A spokesman for the U.S. representative said in November that Davidson is working on a bill that, once law, would treat ICOs as products rather than securities at the federal and state level, effectively “sidestepping” security laws.As Cointelegraph reported yesterday, seven Ohio funds will hand over $300 million to blockchain startups by the end of 2021. Of this money, $100 million will be invested by nonprofit JumpStart."

He said:“I want to warn those who are promoting STO fundraising in Beijing. Don’t do it in Beijing. You will be kicked out if you do it.”On the other hand, blockchain adoption — the tech behind most cryptocurrencies — has been relatively embraced in China. As Cointelegraph recently reported, a Chinese Internet Court has started using blockchain to protect the intellectual property of online writers.The legal basis of this development can be assumed to be the Chinese Supreme Court’s ruling from September, which established that blockchain can legally authenticate evidence."

And, we must strive to balance economic opportunity with consumer protection.”Over the last year, administrations of other U.S. states have also established blockchain working groups. This summer, Connecticut governor Dannel Malloy signed SB 443 into law, which established a blockchain working group to study the technology. The body is also tasked with shaping a plan to “[foster] the expansion of the blockchain industry in the state.”California’s AB 2658, a bill that calls for the establishment of a working group on blockchain technology, passed both houses of the state legislature in August, and was subsequently signed into law by the governor in late September. The bill defines blockchain as “a mathematically secured, chronological, and decentralized ledger or database.”In March, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) created a blockchain working group to identify and target fraudulent schemes which affect the FTC’s consumer protection and competition missions. The group intends to combine expertise and practices on one platform which will coordinate efforts in countering fraud in blockchain and cryptocurrency-related fields."

Binance KYC Breach — Did It Happen, ...","Nov 29, 2018",A new bulletin from Russian internet security company Kaspersky Labs published Nov. 28 states that crypto mining malware became increasingly popular among botnets in 2018.,"Stealth crypto mining attacks – also know as cryptojacking – work by installing malware that uses a computer’s processing power to mine for cryptocurrencies without the owner’s consent or knowledge.According to Kaspersky, after the crypto market bull run subsided in Jan.-Feb. 2018, interest in cryptojacking also briefly tapered off – yet it has nonetheless remained a consistent and current threat throughout the year.Number of unique users attacked by miners in Q1–Q3 2018Among botnets in particular, during the Q1 2018 cryptojacking “boom,” the share of cryptojacking malware downloaded by botnets, out of total files, hit 4.6 percent – as compared with 2.9 percent in Q2 2017. The bulletin extrapolates that botnets are therefore becoming increasingly viewed as a means of spreading crypto mining malware, with cybercriminals increasingly viewing cryptojacking as more favorable than other attack vectors.Kaspersky thus found that Q3 2018 saw a decline in the number of DDoS attacks from botnets, arguing “the most likely reason being [...] the ‘reprofiling’ of botnets from DDoS attacks to cryptocurrency mining”:“[I]f executed properly, [cryptojacking] can be impossible for the owner of an infected machine to detect [...] the reprofiling of existing server capacity completely hides its owner from the eyes of the law. Evidence suggests that the owners of many well-known botnets have switched their attack vector toward mining.  For example, the DDoS activity of the Yoyo botnet dropped dramatically, although there is no data about it being dismantled.”Other factors in the rise of cryptojacking are the low “entry threshold” for cybercriminals; web browser based code, such as Coinhive, is one option, and there are also a range of “ready-to-use affiliate programs, open mining pools, and miner builders” at attackers’ disposal.The report notes that “time will tell” what the impact of the November crypto market crash will be on the prevalence of cryptojacking infections.In mid November, cybersecurity research team McAfee Labs uncovered new Russia-made mining malware, which uses consumer devices to mine Monero (XMR), running almost without a trace."

McKinsey & Company, another international management consulting firm, estimates that IoT will have an $11.1 trillion impact on the global economy by 2025.It is clear that it is an already large industry set to grow exponentially over the next decade and beyond.IoT refers to a network of connected devices that are capable of collecting and exchanging data. IoT-enabling platforms provide a common network for devices to dump their data and a common language for these devices to communicate with each other, allowing people to use it to their benefit.Communication devices — or sensors — are embedded in everyday objects, such as phones, TVs, indoor climate systems, electrical appliances, cars, traffic lights and industrial equipment. These sensors continuously emit data about the working status of connected devices and allow them to send and receive data from each other via the cloud (internet).IoT platforms will then analyze the data to extract valuable information and share it with other devices to initiate specific commands or actions.  The result is a better human experience, greater automation and improved efficiencies.In manufacturing, for example, all the different components and machines in the factory could be fitted with sensors that continuously transmit system health data back to the mobile apps of operators. Potential problems can then be identified and fixed before a breakdown happens, saving companies time and money.If we look at a direct-to-consumer product, such as air conditioners, units can be embedded with a sensor that emits data regarding the system health and temperature. Data will be continuously downloaded and analyzed in an IoT network. If an issue comes up, customer support can then be contacted for repair work before you even know there is a problem.The use cases of IoT are near enough endless, from keeping medical devices in patients in good working order to fighting rapid deforestation in rainforests across the globe.But IoT networks are not perfect. Devices are constantly sharing critical information back and forth over the internet, which makes it a prime target for hackers. Privacy and security are therefore major concerns.Some of the more infamous IoT attacks include the Mirai Botnet DDoS (distributed denial of service) attack that affected internet service for nearly the entire East Coast of America, including Twitter, Netflix and Reddit.There was also the planned hacking of a Jeep to expose some of the vulnerabilities in IoT devices in cars and the catastrophic consequences it could have when breached, along with the very real FDA recall of 500,000 IoT connected pacemakers in September 2017 because security loopholes were discovered that could allow hackers to tamper with the medical devices once implanted in patients.Blockchain at its core is a cryptographically secured, distributed ledger that allows for the secure transfer of data between parties.Traditional IoT systems are dependent on a centralized architecture. Information is sent from the device to the cloud where the data is processed using analytics and then sent back to the IoT devices. With billions of devices set to join IoT networks in the coming years, this type of centralized system has very limited scalability, exposes billions of weak points that compromise network security and will become incredibly expensive and slow if third-parties have to constantly check and authenticate each and every micro-transaction between devices.Smart contracts in blockchain networks will allow devices to function securely and autonomously by creating agreements that are only executed upon completion of specific requirements. It not only allows for greater automation, scalability and cheaper transfers (no third-party needed to oversee transactions) but these smart contracts can also prevent overrides by individuals that want to use the data for their own benefit. Information is shared across a decentralized, cryptographically secured network, meaning it becomes very difficult to compromise the network security.Finally, with a centralized network, the risk of a single point of failure disabling an entire network is a very real possibility. A decentralized blockchain network mitigates this risk with millions of individual nodes that transfer data on a peer-to-peer (p2p) basis to keep the rest of the IoT network running smoothly.Several blockchain platforms focusing on IoT are emerging as the industry gets bigger.One of the first blockchain IoT platforms is IOTA. It was designed specifically for the Internet of Things and provides a transaction settlement and data transfer layer for connected devices.They’ve created the Tangle platform, which developers describe as “going beyond blockchain.” It’s a blockless, cryptographic, decentralized network, where, instead of outsourcing network verification, users verify transactions of other users.The benefit is twofold: It allows for greater scalability and it eliminates the need to pay transaction fees to miners. Both these factors are essential in a practical IoT network that could require the processing of billions of micro-transactions between devices on a daily basis.IOTA has also entered into several important partnerships including:But IOTA is not the only IoT-focused blockchain platform, others include:HdacThe Hyundai Digital Asset Company (Hdac) is applying blockchain technology to quickly and effectively communicate, handle identity verification, authentication and data storage between IoT devices. The system incorporates a double-chain system (public and private) to increase transaction rate and volume, which makes it ideally suited for IoT devices.The technology is applied to smart factories, smart homes and smart buildings for machine-to-machine transactions and operation between IoT devices.VeChainVeChain is a global enterprise-level public blockchain platform. The blockchain is used in a variety of ways, with one focus being on advanced IoT integration in cold-chain logistics by using proprietary IoT devices to track key metrics — such as temperature — throughout the entire journey. In addition, the platform can hold automobile passports by creating digital records of cars — including repair history, insurance, registration and even driver behavior throughout its lifecycle.Medical and healthcare applications are also possible by using end-to-end tracking of production processes of medical devices and allows patients to securely share their biometric data with their doctors to enable real-time monitoring. VeChain also uses IoT technology for luxury goods by embedding smart chips within the luxury products so that brands can monitor their sales channels in real-time, thereby preventing illegal overstock trading and allowing consumers the ability to verify the authenticity of the luxury product.WaltonchainWaltonchain is created through a combination of RFID and blockchain technologies for effective IoT integration.They primarily focus on tracking processes and products in the supply chain, where the technology can be applied to high-end clothing identification, food and drug traceability and logistics tracking by implanting RFID tags and reader-writer control chips into products. Information regarding the status of products is then downloaded for analyses onto a secure blockchain.StreamrStreamr is an open-source blockchain infrastructure to power the world’s data economy and to give people back control of their own information. Their technology can be implanted into everyday objects — such as cars — to record data including traffic, potholes and local fuel prices. The user can then choose to sell this data to fellow car users or highway agencies, or buy information from other users that will help them make real-time decisions in a connected smart city.Information travels through the decentralized peer-to-peer network to get posted on the network nodes and is powered by the network’s native cryptocurrency (DATACOIN).This is just a small sample of blockchain-based IoT platforms and the list keeps on growing as the industry evolves. Other projects include Ambrosus, IoT Chain, Atonomi, Chain of Things, IoTeX, OriginTrail, Slock.it, BlockMesh, Helium, Moeco, FOAM, Fysical, Grid+ and Power Ledger.Great strides in development have been made in this area, but blockchain’s application in IoT is far from perfect and several key challenges will have to be overcome before we will see the complete benefit of blockchain in IoT be realized.ScalabilityCan blockchain networks cope with the sheer volume of data that is expected to be produced by IoT devices in the next five to 10 years without slowing down transaction speeds or the flow of data? IOTA addresses this issue specifically by not using a blockchain-based decentralized network, instead opting for their Tangle platform. But this is just one project. More well-known blockchains like Ethereum and Bitcoin have long been suffering from scalability issues and is not suited for the amount of data IoT devices are producing.SecurityDecentralized blockchain networks provide a high level of security, but what level of weakness (if any) do the IoT devices create at the point where they connect to the network? Devices themselves will have to be secured as well to prevent hackers from tampering with them.InteroperabilityCross-chain interoperability will have to be addressed and improved if we truly want to leverage the benefits of interconnected smart devices. If not, we can end up with a situation where we are connected to multiple isolated decentralized networks that work well for their purpose but can’t necessarily talk to other devices for which they were not specifically designed.Legal, compliance and regulationThe allocation of responsibility will have to be closely examined. How smart contract actions are regulated in the world outside of blockchain will also have to be stipulated. For example, who takes responsibility if an IoT-connected medical device implanted in a patient takes an action based on certain smart contract rules but ends up causing the patient harm? Is this the responsibility of the manufacturer or the IoT platform? If the IoT platform is blockchain-based, it will be decentralized without a controlling entity, so pinpointing an accountable party might present a problem."

The proposal also calls for solutions that would enable investigators to conduct relevant analysis on blockchain transactions.Notably, DHS states that, while previous analysis has been conducted on Bitcoin (BTC) analytics, this only covers a “limited scope in the realm of cryptocurrencies.” The DHS proposal seeks applications of blockchain analytics for privacy-oriented altcoins like Zcash and Monero, which operate on private blockchains.The document notes that ongoing research within the field facilitates technologies, the key features of which include better capabilities for maintaining anonymity and privacy protection. While DHS notes that these traits are “desirable,” there is “a compelling interest in tracing and understanding transactions and actions on the blockchain of an illegal nature.”The forensic analysis of blockchain transactions could purportedly be approached in various ways and consider different data situation use cases, while the desired solution should “provide working approaches to treating newer blockchain implementations.” DHS also notes that the solution may be applied in other aspects of administration:“Because of the significant impact in areas such as governance, data sharing agreement enforcement, and encrypted analytics interchanges, there are a wide variety of applications in government and the commercial marketplace that can benefit from successful product development.”The current document is a pre-solicitation notice.

Round-Up of Crypto Exchange Hacks So Far in 2019 — How Can ...","Dec 7, 2018","United States’ cryptocurrency regulations are creating a problematic image for the country as an innovator and it needs a “more nuanced approach.”  Two university professors have made this claim in an article Friday, Dec. 7, referring to a paper originally published Nov. 16.","Discussing the current regulatory setup governing cryptocurrency, Carol Goforth of Oxford University and Arkansas School of Law’s Clayton N. Little blamed the “overlapping” authority of various regulators as hindering progress.The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and more all attempt to govern cryptocurrency, the professors say, but each from a different perspective.“Because different agencies in the U.S. have different regulatory powers and responsibilities, each agency has tended to classify the very same assets differently in order to assert jurisdiction,” the paper reads.As Cointelegraph has often reported, representatives of the SEC and CFTC in particular continue to be vocal about the need to comply with existing laws when issuing, dealing in or trading cryptocurrencies.In October, CFTC chairman Christopher Giancarlo acknowledged the complexity of the situation regarding his agency and the SEC.“…Different orientation, different histories, so we do come at these things from different perspectives,” he told CNBC’s ‘Fast Money’ segment at a conference.For Goforth and Clayton, however, the situation does more harm than good. In a summary of their work for the Oxford Faculty of Law Dec. 7, Goforth wrote:“Although various authorities in the US have repeatedly claimed that they do not wish to over-regulate cryptoassets or to stifle innovation in the space, overlapping regulations produced by a multitude of distinct agencies with different missions and priorities have produced a confusing mix of classifications and requirements.”It was “easy,” she said, to “see why the US is not regarded as being receptive to crypto.”This year, cryptocurrency exchanges including Coinbase and Bittrex began a trend of setting up operations in a more permissive jurisdiction beyond the control of the SEC and CFTC in order to offer international clients additional coins not available to their U.S. counterparts."

What to Expect From ...","Dec 13, 2018",A Dec. 12 Business Law Blog post from the University of Oxford Faculty of Law notes possible repercussions for lost and stolen crypto claims following a case in a Canadian trial court earlier this year.,"In the post, SAFE Frankfurt researcher Grygoriy Pustovit notes the case of Copytrack Pte Ltd v Wall. The superior trial court of British Columbia ruled that Ethereum (ETH) tokens, which were mistakenly sent by the plaintiff, Singapore blockchain startup Copytrack, to the defendant, Brian Wall, must be returned to Copytrack.The defendant mistakenly received 530 Ethereum coins from Copytrack instead of 530 Copytrack (CPY) tokens that he was supposed to receive after participating in Copytrack’s initial coin offering (ICO). The Ethereum amounted to 495,000 Canadian dollars ($370,482), while the value of CPY tokens he intended to purchase was 780 Canadian dollars ($583) at the time.""This precedent may have major repercussions for the enforcement of claims regarding lost or stolen cryptocurrency,"" Pustovit claims, as the ruling allows the plaintiff to trace and recover tokens “in whatsoever hands those Ether Tokens may currently be held.”As professional services for tracing digital assets develop, the rightful owners of certain assets could trace them on a public ledger and ostensibly recover tokens once they appear in an exchange’s wallet. Pustovit states that blockchains are not only governed by their code, but by the laws of concerned jurisdictions as well.While noting that cross-border enforcement of varying national laws and regulations could prove difficult, the blog says that crypto businesses will likely comply with judgements in jurisdictions wherein they have strategic interests.Pustovit also states that the Canadian court “missed the opportunity” to define the legal character of cryptocurrencies because it “could not be handled through summary judgment.” Since the defendant was deceased, “there would be no practical utility in sending this matter to trial.” The court therefore ruled the Ethereum tokens to simply be the property of the plaintiff and that they should be returned. Claims in conversion and detinue were left unsettled.While the legal status of cryptocurrencies in case law remains hazy, “there is an increasing number of decisions recognizing that other intangible assets, e.g. funds, shares and mineral interests, may be subject to claims in conversion and detinue.”Canada is reportedly one of the most crypto-friendly countries, with its favorable regulation of the industry, and low energy costs for crypto mining. In the summer of 2018, the Canadian government issued an official draft regulation for crypto exchanges and payment operators.Additional reporting by Helen Partz"

All changes are purportedly recorded on chain, while the new product is also able to automatically scale and execute two to three times more transactions than already existing products.Andy Jassy, the CEO of Amazon Web Services (AWS), reportedly said that the product “will be really scalable, you’ll have a much more flexible and robust set of APIs [application program interfaces] for you to make any kind of changes or adjustments to the ledger database.” On the product’s website, Amazon gives a broader description of the new service:“With QLDB, your data’s change history is immutable — it cannot be altered or deleted — and using cryptography, you can easily verify that there have been no unintended modifications to your application’s data.”Apart from QLDB, Amazon also announced AWS Managed Blockchain product, which can operate with QLDB, allowing users to adjust and manage a scalable blockchain network. The product reportedly automatically scales depending on the needs of specific applications, and is deployed in managing certificates, inviting new users to the network, and tracing metrics like memory and storage resources and usage of computer.Earlier this month, Amazon won two patents related to methods for protecting the integrity of digital signatures and improving distributed data storage. The first patent outlines a “signature delegation” method for “protecting the integrity of digital signatures and encrypted communications.” The second filing proposes a “grid encoding technique” for distributed data storage by using groups of collected “shards,” where each shard represents a logical distribution of data items stored in a given grid.Also this month, AWS and ConsenSys’ blockchain startup Kaleido launched a full-stack platform dubbed Kaleido Marketplace, that helps enterprises implement blockchain solutions. The platform “eliminates 80 percent of the custom code” needed to build a given blockchain project by providing an array of full-stack tools and protocols that are “plug-and-play,” spanning needs from back-end development to front-end app user interfaces."

The precedent that will likely shape the body of U.S. case law on fraudulent initial coin offerings (ICOs) is currently being forged in a federal court in the New York borough of Brooklyn, where a 39-year old entrepreneur, Maksim Zaslavskiy, has pleaded guilty to committing securities fraud.","The development that will most likely result in a landmark decision – the jury will gather in April 2019 to decide on a sentence – is yet another twist of a now 14 month-long effort, involving both the U.S. Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Previously, the process has already yielded a fateful ruling by a federal judge who in September established that securities law is applicable to ICO-related cases.The case that is poised to become so consequential for the whole ICO space deals with two ventures that neither issued a token nor developed any blockchain-powered infrastructure: REcoin and Diamond Reserve Coin both only existed on paper. Yet it also makes perfect sense that the authorities first went after the most brazen instances of ICO fraud, the ones that hurt rookie retail investors the worst and inflicted the most reputational damage on the industry.When the SEC first filed a complaint against Zaslavskiy in a federal court in September 2017, it was estimated that REcoin and Diamond Reserve Coin ICOs resulted in around 1,000 investors losing some $300,000. Having fallen for Zaslavskiy’s aggressive marketing campaign, these people were led to believe that they either invested in a digital asset that was backed by real estate located in developed countries (REcoin), or purchased a tokenized membership in an elite club for wealthy business people, with physical diamonds in the company’s custody underlying the value of tokens.In fact, though, they were buying “worthless certificates,” as U.S. district attorney, Richard Donague, put it, on Nov. 15, 2018, Zaslavskiy admitted in his guilty plea: “We had not yet purchased any real estate.” He now faces up to 5 years in prison, pending the decision of a jury panel. The regulator is also filing a civil lawsuit against Zaslavskiy.The Ukrainian city of Odessa, overlooking a scenic coastline of the Black Sea, is known for its vibrant spirit and unique culture. Throughout both the Imperial and Soviet periods of its history, the city has been home to a large Jewish community. As the final years of the USSR saw the liberalization of immigration policies, many Odessan Jews chose to leave for either Israel or the West. Born in Odessa, Maksim Zaslavskiy was 12 when his family relocated to the U.S. While Maksim was destined to make ICO history, his brother, Dmitry, chose a banking career and later became an executive director for Morgan Stanley.Zaslavskiy’s social media pages, as well as websites of many organizations he ran at various points of time, were either deleted or became unavailable in the wake of the high-profile investigation into his activities. The main source of information about his pre-trial life is now the four-hour interview to the SEC representative that he gave in September 2017, of which the Fast Company magazine managed to obtain a transcript.In 2003, Zaslavskiy received his degree in finance from Baruch College, followed by a LLM from Yeshiva University’s Cardozo School of Law three years later. He worked as an IT consultant for several banks before starting his own international business, whose nature is difficult to infer from the interview. Zaslavskiy also claimed to have been involved in real estate business since the age of 18, yet Fast Company’s investigation failed to verify his employment with the firms he claimed to have worked for.According to the interview, the 2008 crisis became a major blow for Zaslavskiy’s business, further entrenching him in his resentment of the U.S. financial system. He turned to charity work, founding a philanthropic organization called Live Love Laugh. However, it is impossible to say whether the ambitious statements on its website (which is now down) were ever backed by any real actions, since the entity appears to never have been properly registered.Zaslavskiy has also written at least three books (under the name Avi Meir Zaslavsky) that can be still found on Amazon. These are how-to guidebooks on the ins and outs of real estate business. Another one, which appeared around the time his two ICOs were in full swing in August 2017, sets out to explain the reader that “what you perceive and use as money is designed in such a way that the wealth created by the economy truly benefits only large banks and multinational corporations.”Apparently, the book was meant to lend credibility to Zaslavskiy’s claim for intellectual leadership in the crypto space, as its press release presents him as “one of the world’s leading currency decentralization proponents.” The publicity campaign around the book provides a glimpse into Zaslavskiy’s approach to marketing himself and his ventures: bold, extravagant, overblown. Unsurprisingly, this style carried over to the way his two ICOs were presented to potential investors.For someone disenchanted with both the traditional financial system and traditional means of making money, the ICO rush of 2017 presented innumerable opportunities. The beauty of the ICO model was that it opened up the world of venture capital, previously reserved exclusively for professional investors, to anyone with a few spare dollars and some interest in the uncharted space of blockchain applications. The flipside of it is that some of the newcomers were unable to tell legitimate projects from outright scams replete with red flags.Megalomaniac language and exaggerated promises are usually telltale signs of something not being right with the venture that’s taking off. Zaslavskiy’s projects had both. REcoin, announced in June 2017, presented its founder as a “Real Estate guru” and proclaimed that the 101REcoin Trust held properties “in developed and stable economies like the USA, Canada, Japan, Great Britain, and Switzerland” without providing any evidence in support. Also, an “international team of attorneys and programmers” was allegedly there to “work tirelessly” on increasing token holders’ fortunes. As the court proceedings later revealed, no such team ever existed.In August, after facing the first signs of SEC interest to REcoin, the “Entrepreneur, Philanthropist, and Author Max Zaslavsky” began his marketing campaign for an allegedly diamond-backed digital asset, the Diamond Reserve Club token. The release (beginning with “If the Holy Scriptures have taught us anything at all…”) touted a brand new Initial Membership Offering model, which was supposed to tokenize investors’ participation in a large ecosystem of interconnected businesses. It also suggested that the tokens could be inherited by the investors’ grandchildren.One would think that the theatrical language and gargantuan assurances of the two ICOs’ public-facing documents would only make any reasonable person scoff. Yet from July through September Zaslavskiy and his accomplices managed to amass around $300,000 before the SEC took the matter to court.On Sep. 29, 2017, the SEC brought a civil complaint to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York against Zaslavskiy and his two companies for violating U.S. securities laws. Recoin and DRC responded on their websites with a joint statement that argued that it was due to “lack of legal clarity as to when an ICO or a digital asset is a security,” suggesting that their operations were not within the SEC’s purview.However, the Feds seemed to disagree. On Nov. 1, Zaslavskiy was apprehended by FBI agents and criminally charged with a conspiracy to commit securities fraud. In early December, he pleaded not guilty and secured a $250,000 bail backed by his family’s Brooklyn house. In February, Zaslavskiy’s defense filed a motion to dismiss the indictment on the grounds of inappropriate application of securities law to cryptocurrencies. Yet both the DoJ and SEC insisted that REcoin and DRC tokens passed the Howey test – a legal standard that determines whether a contract is a security.In September, U.S. district judge Raymond Dearie concluded that for the purposes of the case, the tokens could, indeed, be treated as securities, potentially setting a precedent that could shape the future of ICO regulation. The judge was also unequivocal in characterizing the nature of Zaslavskiy’s enterprises:“Stripped of the 21st century jargon, including the Defendant’s own characterization of the offered investment opportunities, the challenged indictment charges a straightforward scam, replete with the common characteristics of many financial frauds.”"

The document explains that “permissionless distributed protocols must incentivize various aspects of participation in the protocol,” noting Bitcoin (BTC) mining as an example system.The first topic thus focuses on creating large-scale permissionless distributed consensus protocols without paying participants.The second subject covered in the RFI is economic-driven security models for distributed computation protocols, asking for information about “methods that leverage rigorous economic notions to advance theories of security for distributed, permissionless computation protocols.”The third, and last topic on which the agency requested information covers the “centralities of distributed consensus protocols.” Responses for this category are “novel analyses, methods to analyze and/or address the centralization of a distributed consensus protocol,” but also “unintended centralities and/or associated mitigations.”The RFI also recognizes the potential of blockchain technology for data security and storage “resilience” for the government department, stating:“Technologies for distributed consensus protocols have been revolutionized by their prominent role in cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies. These technologies have dramatic implications for the security and resilience of critical data storage and computation tasks, including for the Department of Defense.”The agency’s announcement fits a broader trend of ever-increasing interest towards blockchain shown by government agencies globally. On Nov. 22, a German news outlet reported that the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi) is planning to use blockchain to fight tax evasion.In May 2017, DARPA awarded a grant to messaging app Crypto-Chat developer ITAMCO to develop an encrypted, blockchain-based messaging and transaction platform for the U.S. military."

Sun’s claims at the time prompted a surge of eight percent in the TRX token’s value.In recent weeks, TRX — as ETH and EOS — has shed significant value amid volatile markets; the token, ranked 10th largest crypto on CoinMarketCap, is down 4.5 percent on the day, and 44 percent on the month, to trade at $0.013 at press time.ETH, ranked 3rd, is meanwhile down 14.5 percent on the day and 59 percent on its monthly chart, currently trading at $85. EOS, trading at $1.71 at press time, is down 21.2 percent on the day, 69 percent on the month.In mid-November, TRON launched a $1 million accelerator program to support developers building DApps and products on the TRON protocol.In early November, decentralized liquidity network Bancor announced it had added support for EOS within its dApp for cross-blockchain token swaps.

The overall losses for Overstock amounted $163.7 million for the reported period of 2018.Byrne, however, remains stalwartly optimistic about his blockchain ventures. “I don’t care whether tZero [one of the projects backed by Medici] is losing $2 million a month. We think we’ve got cold fusion on the blockchain side,” he explained in the interview.Medici losses compared to overall Overstock losses in 2017-2018. Source: WSJOverstock was launched back in 1999 to sell surplus and returned merchandise online and became a “pioneer” in the crypto space by becoming one of the first major companies to accept Bitcoin (BTC) in 2014.According to WSJ, a remote blockchain-driven voting in U.S. state of West Virginia was among the projects that Medici backed this year. As Cointelegraph reported following the matter, in the 2018 midterm elections, 144 military personnel stationed overseas from 24 counties were able to vote via a decentralized mobile platform Voatz. Despite the concerns about the security of mobile voting, West Virginia’s officials considered the experiment a success.Another project supported by Overstock’s blockchain division is a land registry platform in Zambia. In August, Medici Land Governance partnered with the Zambian government to develop a system of decentralized land ownership, allowing rural landowners to legitimize their estates and gain access to the financial world."

This creates a technical problem of competing interests within the technology.”Mastercard is by no means the first to tackle the limitations of anonymity within blockchain systems; two high profile privacy-focused altcoins, Zcash (ZEC) and Monero (XMR), are both designed with similar concerns in mind.ZEC uses Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) technology, an alternative algorithm for authenticating distributed ledger entries, in which transacting parties provide proof of validity, but all other information remains encrypted, including their identities. Monero, meanwhile, uses stealth addresses to mask identities by enabling a sender to create a random one-time address that is based on the transaction receiver’s published address."

The funding was reported by Fortune’s crypto-focused news section The Ledger on Dec. 4.,"Dr. Andrew Chi-Chih Yao, a Turing Award recipient who has earned the moniker of China’s “godfather of computer science,” is among those spearheading the Singapore-registered Conflux Foundation. The Turing Award is an annual $1 million prize given to a person that has exceeded in the field of computer science.The network, dubbed “Conflux,” has been designed to tackle what is perceived to be blockchain’s biggest hurdle — scalability — proclaiming its new testnet to be capable of processing ”at least 6,500 Transactions Per Second (TPS), while supporting at least 20,000 nodes.”Alongside Sequoia, Conflux has reportedly received support from a host of high-profile tech and venture capital firms that include IMO Ventures, FreesFund, Rong 360, Shunwei Capital, F2Pool, and major crypto exchange Huobi. In addition, Fortune cites “a source close to Conflux” as revealing that an unnamed “prominent” Chinese internet search company has backed the venture.Fellow co-founder Fan Long, a professor at the University of Toronto, told Fortune that:“Conflux’s main idea is how to make the whole blockchain scalable. We’ve changed the structure of the blockchain so that it’s no longer a chain in the sense that it records each block based on what its parent block says [...] Contrary to popular belief, true decentralization isn’t sacrificed to increase throughput.”The “main idea” entails using a directed acyclic graph (DAG): different from a blockchain in that it entails a topologically ordered system in which different types of transactions run on different chains in the network simultaneously. In the crypto and blockchain space, the protocol is notably already in use as the basis of the IOTA Foundation’s Tangle architecture.Conflux combines DAG with a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus algorithm, and also allows network users to run smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps) on the network. Long told Fortune that running smart contracts and DApps on a scalable, high-throughput protocol will enable both to gain traction beyond the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) space, and to extend to the finance and insurance sectors.According to Long, the Foundation will release its testnet by the end of February 2019, and its main network by 3Q 2019.While the scalability issue continues to be avidly discussed in the blockchain community, a recent study by the leading global post-trade financial services firm Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) found that distributed ledger technologies (DLT) such as blockchain are in fact scalable enough to support daily trade volumes of the U.S. equity market."

[...] The Generalitat has not made a clear commitment to the blockchain and is still exploring what options there are before deciding.”The director noted that, regardless of what technology the government decides to use in the voting system, it must instill trust.

Gaming Is Flawed, Blockchain-Based Platform Says. European ...","Dec 14, 2018","After months of monitoring and observing the “promising and challenging” potential of distributed ledger technology (DLT), the European Union (EU) is finally making a turn into the blockchain industry.","Back in February 2018, the European Commission (EC) launched the EU Blockchain Observatory and Forum, aimed to support European cross-border engagement with the technology and its multiple stakeholders and to unite the economy around blockchain.Since its official launch, the newly established organization — supported by European Parliament — has released three thematic reports: the first one in July, dubbed “Blockchain Innovation in Europe”; the second one in October, “Blockchain and the GDPR”; and the third one in December, “Blockchain for Government and Public Services.”The second major step was taken in April when 22 countries — 21 EU member states and Norway — signed a Declaration that created a European Blockchain Partnership (EBP). During 2018, five more European countries joined the EBP: Greece and Romania in May, Denmark and Cyprus in June, and Italy — the last member to join — in September. The partnership’s main focus is on cybersecurity, privacy, energy efficiency and interoperability, all in full compliance with EU law.As Mariya Gabriel, commissioner for the Digital Economy and Society, underlined welcoming the established of the EBP:Blockchain is a great opportunity for Europe and Member States to rethink their information systems, to promote user trust and the protection of personal data, to help create new business opportunities and to establish new areas of leadership, benefiting citizens, public services and companies (sic)Back in the fall, ResearchAndMarkets.com published a new report dubbed “EU5 Blockchain Technology Market (2018-2023).“ In the report, the EU is expected to increase its investment into blockchain- and DLT-related projects from $94 million in 2018 to $386 million by 2020. The positive view within the document toward the blockchain industry in Europe is based on several crucial facts: The EC is liberalizing the industry’s regulation and it creates a new task force entrusted with blockchain expertise.Another move toward blockchain was made in October this year when the European Parliament formed a resolution titled “Distributed ledger technologies and blockchains: building trust with disintermediation.” The resolution states that DLT “could potentially affect all sectors of the economy,” but it focuses on several important spheres: finances, health care, transport, education, copyrights, public governance, data protection, and some others.The agreement shows that the Parliament has set the plans for the EC to ensure that its proposed policies would be realized, taking into account benefits of the DLT implementations and warning about some of the related risks. This resolution is a crucial document, as it means that Parliament articulated several main features.The potential of DLT implementation in the health care and medical sector was among the first initiatives discussed by the European Union. My Health My Data (MHMD), the EU-funded project, has been aimed “to use blockchain technology to enable medical data to be stored and transmitted safely and effectively.” The resolution signed in October highlighted that blockchain would “improve data efficiency and the reporting of clinical trials in the health sector, allowing digital data exchange across public and private institutions under the control of the citizens/patients.”For the EU, the main focus of the implementation of blockchain technology is on the protection of personal data (followed by the General Data Protection Regulation, known as GDPR), which gives “people more control over how they store, manage and use personal data generated online,” says DECODE, another blockchain project funded by the EU. According to the document, blockchain “should protect the privacy of sensitive health data” and allow “citizens to control their health data and benefit from transparency thereon, and to choose which data to share, also with regard to their use by insurance companies and the wider health care ecosystem.”It also underlines the importance of improving the health care sector with DLT “through electronic health data interoperability, identity verification and a better distribution of medication,” as well as improving the management of health care systems.There are several major advantages of DLT implementation for the financial sector within Europe. One of them is, definitely, the significance of the blockchain technology in financial intermediation by “improving transparency and reducing transaction costs and hidden costs by better managing data and streamlining processes.”The EC and local regulatory authorities are to monitor trends of DLT implementation in the finance industry and are encouraged to do “the research and experimentation that major financial institutions have undertaken in the exploration of the capabilities of DLT.”The European Parliament also expressed its concern about the “volatility and uncertainty” of cryptocurrencies. It requires the EC and the European Central Bank (ECB) “to provide feedback on the sources of volatility of cryptocurrencies, identify dangers for the public, and explore the possibilities of incorporating cryptocurrencies in the European payment system.”There are certain risks related to initial coin offerings (ICOs), and the resolution stresses the “lack of clarity with regard to the legal framework applicable to ICOs,” that could negatively affect the investment and funding potential of ICOs. The Parliament asks the EC and national regulatory authorities “to identify criteria that enhance investor protection and articulate disclosure requirements and obligations for the initiators of ICOs” to avoid risks and dangers related to ICO projects.The certainty and clarity of the crowdfunding in the crypto space could increase investor and consumer protection and reduce “the risks stemming from asymmetric information, fraudulent behaviour, illegal activities such as money laundering and tax evasion.”Meanwhile, the Distributed ledger technologies and blockchains resolution has more political significance than legal, as the EC is not required to do anything in response to these requests.Last week, four major blockchain companies — including Ripple, the NEM Foundation, Emurgo (based on the Cardano blockchain) and “smart ledger” development firm Fetch.AI — formed “Blockchain for Europe” Association. It is aimed to help the EU “shape the global agenda” on blockchain by providing education on the technology’s potential and by developing “smart regulation” of the blockchain industry.The EC does not appear to be fully involved in promoting a global regulatory framework for the blockchain and cryptocurrency ecosystems. The general idea is to focus on promoting the regulations of the technology on national levels.A vivid example of it is another declaration signed on December 4 between seven southern European countries — including France, Italy, Cyprus, Portugal, Spain, and Greece. It was reportedly initiated by Malta, commonly known as the “Blockchain Island” of Europe. This declaration calls the EU for help to “promote DLT that is most associated with cryptocurrencies but is increasingly being used by governments to offer services to citizens.”Switzerland is another European country, but not a member state, that has friendly regulation on the blockchain and crypto industries.Europe has the ambitions to become ""the global leader in the field of DLT,"" which can be seen from the number of initiatives taken place over the 2018 year. Still, it might want to consider bringing more legal power to them rather than just “raising the awareness.”"

sell ...","Dec 3, 2018","Kakao, South Korea’s largest internet conglomerate that operates applications and have nearly a 90 percent dominance in their respective markets, is running an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) to raise funds for its blockchain project called Clay.","In March, Kakao released its initial attempt to conduct a token sale by establishing an entity in Switzerland. But, with resistance from the Financial Services Commission (FSC), the corporation was not able to pursue its plans. With no changes made to the regulatory framework regarding ICOs in South Korea, how has Kakao been able to raise funds to create a blockchain project?On Nov. 19, The Hankyoreh — a business-focused mainstream media outlet in South Korea — exclusively reported that Kakao is planning to raise around $300 million to develop its own token.A source told the local publication that the majority of the funds have already been secured by Ground X, a subsidiary of Kakao that focuses on blockchain operations. The source added that a Chinese venture capital firm is said to be involved in the token sale.“The target amount is $300 million and Kakao is very close to securing its target. A China-based venture capital executive held a meeting with Ground X in September and, even at the time, Ground X was planning to raise $300 million.”As a private sale, only registered, accredited and approved institutional investors are allowed to invest in the token sale of Kakao. Considering that all of Kakao’s meetings with accredited investors were held confidentially — without any information provided to the media, unlike the Telegram ICO in May — the company planned a rigorous path to raise funds in a way that does not violate regulations in Japan, South Korea and even the United States.On Nov. 27, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Jay Clayton said that the vast majority of ICOs that are presently in the global cryptocurrency market are considered securities under existing U.S. laws and emphasized that if companies plan to raise funds through a token sale, firms either need to register with the SEC or conduct a private sale.""We don't believe Bitcoin is a security. Many of the ICOs that you see and you talk about, they are securities. And if you're going to offer or sell securities, you have to do so in compliance with our laws. We've been clear about that, the recent actions further emphasized that our securities laws apply to the ICO space. And if people are going to raise money using Initial Coin Offerings, they either have to do so in private placement or register with the SEC.”Companies prefer not to conduct private token sales unless they are absolutely certain that the product they offer will attract large investors, because a private sale is just as difficult and complex in a legal point of view as raising venture capital funding.It can be argued, given the involvement of local financial authorities — and possibly the SEC — that conducting a private token sale is more resource-intensive than a traditional venture capital funding round.For a company in the size of Kakao, it was of the utmost importance to be compliant with both local and international regulations, rather than completing the target amount of funding. This naturally led the conglomerate to conduct a private sale over a public sale, which could have been more lucrative.Ground X is based in Tokyo, Japan, and the decision to legally establish its blockchain initiative in Japan instead of South Korea by Kakao was likely a strategic move to circumvent various regulatory hurdles pertaining to cryptocurrencies that still exist in the country.Throughout the past three months, South Korea has seen significant progress in cryptocurrency regulation. The government officially provided commercial banks permission to freely work with cryptocurrency exchanges and provide virtual bank accounts to digital asset businesses.Blockchain technology has also been recognized as one of the core pillars of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, alongside big data and artificial intelligence (AI), and the government has established initiatives to bring young talent into the blockchain sector.However, the stance of the government toward ICOs still remains uncertain and while local financial authorities were expected to provide an official announcement regarding the regulatory state of domestic ICOs by the end of November, given the time frame, the government is expected to delay the announcement once again.Whether the ICO conducted by Kakao is a private sale or a public sale, because policies in South Korea remain undetermined, the firm cannot risk being in conflict with local regulations by prematurely conducting a private sale with institutional investors.In December 2017, Chosun — another business-focused mainstream media outlet in South Korea — reported that the government was considering the possibility of allowing institutional investors to participate in private token sales. However, 11 months have passed and the government is yet to make a decision on the matter.Legally, Kakao needed to conduct its private sale in Japan with an entity based in Japan. But, the implications of its blockchain initiative on its relationship with the Financial Services Commission (FSC) remain in question.In July, Choi Jong-ku — the chairman of the FSC, South Korea’s main financial watchdog — disapproved of Kakao’s initial plans to run a public ICO and opposed the idea of Kakao completing a token sale in overseas markets. Commissioner Choi said, warning Kakao:“Even if there is no prohibition on cryptocurrency or digital asset trading, there is a possibility that it [Kakao ICO] may be regarded as fraud or multi-level sales according to the issuance method. Since the risk is very high in terms of investor protection, the government has a negative stance on the ICO.”Speaking to Hankyoreh, a Kakao representative said that while the fundraising could be considered as a private sale, the company does not consider it as one:“Kakao has been securing strategic partners to help improve and grow the global blockchain ecosystem by obtaining new capital. It could be recognized as a private sale, but it’s not open to individual investors and is participated by institutions that are partnering with Kakao. Currently, it is not possible to finalize exact numbers regarding the funding round, and the company is not in the position to openly share which companies are involved in the initiative. Kakao needs to communicate with its partner companies first.”On Nov. 27, Nikkei — a mainstream publication in Japan — reported that the Financial Services Agency (FSA) held a meeting on the Nov.26 to discuss the state of ICO regulation in the country.During the meeting, the FSA and other local financial authorities discussed policies surrounding cryptocurrency exchanges and the possibility of allowing accredited investors access to domestic ICOs.According to local reports, the FSA still restrict public token sales.The token sale conducted by Kakao and Ground X falls under the newly created category by the FSA as a private sale aimed at institutional investors. Legally, the token sale of Clay is fully compliant with the regulations of Japan, South Korea, the U.S. and every other major market.Japan and the U.S. both allow private token sales if approved by local authorities, and South Korea enables both corporations and investors to invest in foreign ICOs.The cryptocurrency market of South Korea has been able to demonstrate signs of improvement in terms of infrastructure and regulation.Most recently, Upbit — the country’s largest cryptocurrency exchange based on daily trading volume provided by CoinMarketCap — successfully obtained an information security management system (ISMS) license from the Korea Internet and Security Agency (KISA) after passing an evaluation phase conducted by the government agency using a criteria with over 253 subsections.Lee Seok-wu, the CEO of Dunamu — a company invested in by Kakao and the parent company of Upbit — said:“Since early 2018, Upbit has been working tirelessly to improve the platform’s internal management system and security measures to obtain the ISMS license. With top class security experts and tested security systems, the company will continue to create a safe trading environment and protect the data of its investors.”The local cryptocurrency and blockchain space has seen progress, but multi-billion dollar companies like Kakao are leaving South Korea to establish blockchain initiatives that well surpass the $100 million mark — which, in Silicon Valley, is acknowledged as a mega round.In October, Min Byung-doo — the chairman of Korea's National Policy Committee — warned the government about an inevitable scenario in which companies move out of the country to kickstart operations that could be worth billions of dollars in the long term.Referencing the $4 billion ICO of Block.one and EOS, chairman Min heavily emphasized that the government could no longer dismiss ICOs, given the positive impact token sales could have on the economy of South Korea.“The government cannot dismiss ICOs. It needs to allow companies to conduct an ICO. [ICOs have] become a new trend in the global market, and it is the responsibility and ability of the government to embrace new technologies. We can see that the flow of investment is clearly changing compared to ICOs and angel fundraising. The ICO has raised $1.7 billion for Telegram and $4 billion for block.one. It is getting bigger and bigger.”Line, a direct competitor to Kakao as the dominant messaging application based in Japan, has also recently released a new token called LINK.The cryptocurrency and blockchain initiatives of Kakao and Line are structurally very similar. Both companies finance cryptocurrency exchanges — with Kakao’s Dunamu operating Upbit and Line directly overseeing the operations of BitBox. The two firms have also created their own unique cryptocurrencies to support their long-term vision in blockchain development.The Japanese government’s forward-thinking approach toward regulating the cryptocurrency market has led two internet conglomerates from South Korea (Line is owned by Naver, the largest search engine in South Korea) to develop and release their own tokens in Japan, with funding from domestic and international companies.Kakao’s Clay is said to have raised $300 million, and the market valuation of Link remains uncertain. However, the two cryptocurrencies have the potential worth billions of dollars collectively in the long run, purely based on the amount of funding the two projects have raised.Line’s Link, for instance, can be used at 94,000 locations in Japan when converted to Line points on the BitBox exchange, demonstrating a level of merchant adoption which most major cryptocurrencies are still yet to see.“In addition to using LINK Points for other DApp services in the LINK Ecosystem, residents in Japan can exchange LINK Points with LINE Points before converting them into JPY at par to make payments at over 94 thousand locations across Japan with LINE Pay, or make purchases in various LINE services,” the Line team explained.The scenario which Korea's National Policy Committee chairman Min Byung-doo feared in October has come to realization faster than expected. Kakao’s abrupt private token sale could potentially lead to the government of South Korea speeding up the process of regulating the local ICO market to facilitate the growth of the local cryptocurrency sector."

Curiel denied the SEC’s request for an injunction against Blockvest, among several other claims.As Cointelegraph recently reported, the regulator has seen greater success in its battle against certain other ICO operators. This month, Paragon and Airfox, both of which raised millions of dollars via ICOs  in 2017 – which the SEC retroactively rules were sales of unregistered securities – accepted a demand to repay a large chunk of funds to investors, along with fines of $250,000 each.In an interview this week meanwhile, SEC chairman Jay Clayton remained tight-lipped regarding changes in treatment of either ICOs or cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs), repeating the regulator’s previous statements."

According to Refinitiv’s statement, the service integrates legal entity data from authoritative sources in over 200 countries and is backed by a global policy that has been tested with more than 100 regulators and financial institutions.Earlier this month, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao said that the company is not concerned over low trade volumes caused by the current market slump, even as the exchange currently has one tenth of the trading volume it did in January 2018. According to Zhao, it is still trading far above the volumes the exchange had “two or three years ago,” and is “still profitable.”Zhao suggested that the entrance of institutions into the industry could be a possible catalyst for market movement, echoing the prediction of investor and digital currency advocate Mike Novogratz, who said that institutional investors will start entering the market in the first or second quarter of 2019, resulting in new highs for Bitcoin’s (BTC) price."

To this end, it will focus on decentralization, decarbonization and digitalization, described in the press release as being the three key “trends” driving the future of the energy industry.As the press release outlines, earlier MGs faced hurdles in providing stable power as they comprised mostly small PVs (PhotoVoltaics, used to generate solar energy), wind turbines (WTs), and energy storage systems (ESS).KEPCO’s Open MG will draw on an “additional fuel cell” as a power source in order to increase energy self-reliance and efficiency, and without the emission of greenhouse gases, a company official has explained. Using international standard technology, the MG is expected to be more interoperable, thereby preventing “system bottleneck” and fragmentation in the industry.As per the press release, KEPCO intends to develop the Open MG at full-scale and create the “first” mega-wattage (MW)-scale micro grid in Korea.As reported last month, KEPCO has partnered with Japan’s  Mitsubishi UFJ Bank, IT service management company Nihon Unisys, and the University of Tokyo on a joint research project into the possible use of blockchain for distributed electricity supply.In early November, the South Korean government pledged to triple its budget (to $35 million) for developing the domestic blockchain and distributed ledger technology (DLT) industry in 2019."

The malware attacks Windows Servers by deploying various evasion methods to skirt its detection. Per Check Point data, several detection engines have registered significantly decreased detection rates, while sensor logs have shown a growing number of KingMiner attacks.The firm has been monitoring KingMiner activity over the past six months and concluded that the malware has evolved in two new versions. The blog post further explains:“The malware continuously adds new features and bypass methods to avoid emulation. Mainly, it manipulates the needed files and creates a dependency which is critical during emulation. In addition, as part of the malware’s ongoing evolution, we have found many placeholders for future operations or upcoming updates which will make this malware even harder to detect.”Check Point has determined that KingMiner uses a private mining pool to bypass any detection of their activities, wherein the pool’s (API) is turned off and the wallet is not used in any public mining pools. The attacks are reportedly widely spread around the world.According to the company’s findings, the malicious software attempts to guess passwords of the servers it attacks. Once a user downloads and executes the Windows Scriptlet file, it reportedly identifies the relevant Central Processing Unit (CPU) architecture of the device and downloads a payload ZIP file based on the detected CPU architecture.The malware eventually destroys the relevant .exe file process and deletes the files themselves, if older versions of the attack files exist. Check Point also notes that the file is not an actual ZIP file, but rather an XML file, which will circumvent emulation attempts.As Cointelegraph reported yesterday, Russian internet security company Kaspersky Labs has found that crypto mining malware became increasingly popular among botnets in 2018. During the Q1 2018 cryptojacking “boom,” the share of cryptojacking malware downloaded by botnets, out of total files, hit 4.6 percent — as compared with 2.9 percent in Q2 2017.Botnets are reportedly therefore becoming increasingly viewed as a means of spreading crypto mining malware, with cybercriminals increasingly viewing cryptojacking as more favorable than other attack vectors."

The currency will purportedly be tied to U.S. dollars, which would help avoid serious swings in value.According to Bloomberg, it is not clear whether NYK’s digital currency will use blockchain technology or be a form of cryptocurrency.Per the anonymous sources, NYK is working with banks and software development companies to ensure the currency’s ability to be converted into local currencies. The company has reportedly conducted successful tests using shipboard telecommunications, and is now seeking a patent for the technology.NYK will supposedly introduce the digital currency in the first half of 2019, while the initiative presupposes the use of smartphones. Along with paying their own workers, the company is also looking to offer the currency to other shipping operators.Port and shipping authorities around the world have already embraced the potential of blockchain technology. Earlier this month, nine major terminal operators and shipping companies signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to launch an open digital platform based on distributed ledger technology (DLT).The new platform will reportedly “allow shippers to digitize and organize their dangerous goods documents and automatically connect with relevant parties to streamline the approval process.”In October, Europe’s largest port, the Port of Rotterdam, partnered with major Dutch bank ABN AMRO and the IT subsidiary of Samsung to test blockchain for shipping.

The launch was announced in a press release published Nov. 27.,"Among ADAM’s founding members are Mike Novogratz’s crypto merchant bank Galaxy Digital, global financial services firm BTIG, fintech firm Paxos – of recently-launched stablecoin PAX – and crypto liquidity solutions provider GSR.According to the press release, ADAM will focus on working with regulators to seek “comprehensive standards” for digital asset market participants. These will aim to encompass trading, custody, clearing and settlement in the sector, and to provide a framework for “ethical conduct” and “professionalism.”The standards are also an attempt to improve transparency for both regulatory authorities, policy makers and the public, and to broadly deter market manipulation, the release notes.Duncan Niederauer, former CEO of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and ADAM Advisory Board Member, is quoted as saying:""Rules are fundamental to the development of any market. Over 200 years ago, market leaders came together to draft rules that led to the creation of the New York Stock Exchange. The advent of digital assets requires a similar effort; one that will clarify existing rules and give both investors and regulators the confidence necessary to sustain this market.”ADAM’s code of conduct will reportedly be established to work as a “complement” to existing laws and regulations in order to “accelerate fair and orderly digital asset markets where innovators and capital can transact with confidence.”Specifically, the code will include guidelines for “market integrity, risk management, KYC and AML, custody, record keeping, clearing and settlement, market manipulation, data protection, and research.”In late October, crypto finance company Circle announced it was participating in the Global Digital Finance (GDF) industry body as a founding member. The GDF is developing its own global “code of conduct” for crypto assets, which will similarly aim to serve as a “shared rulebook” of standards in regard to money handling, risk management, interaction with customers and regulators, and market practices."

On the one hand, this profusion is one of the key driving forces behind innovation in the crypto sphere. But on the other, it arguably acts as a block against widespread adoption, as the lack of unified standards means that some morally questionable endeavors give the rest a bad name.","The past year has seen an intensifying push toward producing international standards for the cryptocurrency industry. Groups such as Global Digital Finance have risen with the aim of fostering universal standards on how crypto platforms are run, just as groups like the Blockchain Association and CryptoUK are now focused mostly on standards at a national level. Such organizations count the likes of Coinbase, Bitstamp, Circle and others as members, despite often being less than a year old.However, while holding the promise that crypto will avoid stringent government regulation by learning how to regulate itself, there's also a concern that global standards might hamper innovation, and that crypto — almost by nature — is not meant to be standardized.As Teana Baker-Taylor, the executive director of Global Digital Finance (GDF), told Cointelegraph, the London-based association aims “to demonstrate that self-governance and driving best practice is critical for the industry's consumers and their confidence in crypto assets, as the sector continues to mature, and in concert with developments in regulation.""In other words, GDF is seeking to develop voluntary guidelines and codes of conduct for exchanges, token sales, wallet providers, cryptocurrencies and ratings websites, and while it was launched only in March, it already has a strong roster of members.At the end of October, payments company Circle (and owner of Poloniex) joined it as a founder member, adding itself to a list that includes Coinbase, R3, ConsenSys and Diginex. Meanwhile, Baker-Taylor affirms that the association has also begun having dialog with lawmakers and public institutions.“With over 250 individuals and firms, global regulators and policy makers have paid attention to the GDF Code and the commitment of the community, and this is an important start. Understandably, the signal from many regulators has been mixed, but most we are engaging with are supportive of maintaining an open dialogue to ensure they do not stifle this important innovation.”Yet, GDF isn’t only working on codes of conduct for token sales and crypto-exchanges. They're also busy devising a taxonomy of cryptocurrencies, which seeks to divide coins into three broad types: payment tokens, financial asset tokens and consumer tokens.Given that there is plenty of confusion and conflict among the world's governments on how to define crypto, this attempt to produce a clear taxonomy of cryptocurrencies is much needed. However, seeing as how such organizations remain largely averse to classifying cryptocurrencies as money and/or assets, there will remain the worry that GDF's taxonomy (and codes) may simply be disregarded by governments and regulators.Despite possible opposition or resistance from governments, the groups like the GDF could have emerged precisely because of increasing government interest in crypto regulation. Anyway, their emergence at such a time presents the crypto world with a golden opportunity to get involved in the shaping of government policy.In October, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) — an intergovernmental group established by the G7 to combat money laundering — adopted a variety of changes to its standards concerning the regulation of virtual assets. And encouragingly for the crypto industry, these new recommendations were focused specifically on preventing money laundering and the financing of terrorism, leaving plenty of freedom for exchanges, token issuers and crypto-services to operate in accordance with the needs of their users and own logic. It said in its recommendations from October:""The FATF Recommendations require monitoring or supervision only for the purposes of AML/CFT [Anti-Money Laundering/Countering Financing of Terrorism], and do not imply that virtual asset service providers are (or should be) subject to stability or consumer/investor protection safeguards, nor do they imply any consumer or investor protection safeguards.""Put simply, the FATF sees no reason to do anything about the volatility or decentralization of cryptocurrency, which implies that it wants to leave the much of decentralized nature of crypto intact. That said, other governmental groups want to do more than simply prevent crypto from being used for crime or terrorism.For example, Felix Hufeld — the chairman of the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) — affirmed his view in October that the global community needs to produce international standards governing the handling of ICOs:""The number (of ICOs) and the volume (of money) per ICO are both getting higher. Investors have mostly minimal rights.""Still, while this could foreshadow a push for intergovernmental standards that dictate what ICOs can and can’t do, such moves remain at a very preliminary stage. And because governments have been slow to act here, this provides an empty space which groups like GDF – or the newly formed Blockchain for Europe association (which includes Ripple and the NEM Foundation as members) – could advantageously fill to the benefit of the wider crypto industry.And while the world's governments and governmental bodies slowly wake up to the idea of regulating cryptocurrencies at a global level, the crypto industry is increasingly producing new trade institutions that are beating them to punch when it comes to developing standards.In March, CryptoUK was established, with the aim of producing self-regulatory standards for the United Kingdom’s cryptocurrency industry. But its chairman, Iqbal V. Gandham, tells Cointelegraph, there’s also an appetite at CryptoUK for international coordination.""CryptoUK’s focus since our launch earlier this year has been on the U.K. — securing proportionate regulation here is our priority, but we support collaboration on regulatory approaches internationally, in particular learning the lessons — both good and bad — from other jurisdictions.”Given that most other self-regulatory trade bodies — such as the Blockchain Association, the Japan Virtual Currency Exchange Association and the Blockchain Foundation of India — are working primarily at the national level, global collaboration on regulatory approaches will be vital if the crypto industry is to enjoy uniform international standards.And to an increasing extent, there does appear to be a growing willingness among crypto-related companies to work with each other on developing (international) standards. In August, the Gemini, Bitstamp, Bittrex and bitFlyer exchanges announced the formation of the Virtual Commodity Association Working Group. And like Global Digital Finance, its aim is to devise global industry standards on how crypto-exchanges are run and cryptocurrencies are traded.There is, then, every reason to believe that the crypto industry will, sooner or later, develop international standards and adopt them at large scale. But the question remains: Will such standards simply give the public greater confidence in crypto, or will they also have the unfortunate side effect of constraining innovation?“In many industries, regulation and standards are seen as stifling innovation. However, in the crypto-assets market, regulatory and legal ambiguity poses challenges for growth.  Clarity around the 'rules of the road' will better enable innovators to access new ways of accessing global capital and support emerging nascent business models with greater confidence.”- Teana Baker-Taylor, executive director of Global Digital FinanceSimilarly, there's a risk that standards could put compliant companies at a disadvantage compared to those corporations or cryptocurrencies that simply (and perhaps illegally) flout them. Given that the decentralized nature of cryptocurrency provides people and groups with greater scope to disregard centralized authority, this is a real danger.However, once international standards are in place and recognized, it becomes much likelier that the companies that do observe them will have a much better chance of working with and influencing regulators — something which will ultimately put them at a competitive advantage. And as Teana Baker-Taylor concludes, there’s a very strong appetite among crypto-related firms to foster and follow strong universal standards.“GDF's community is made up of hundreds of individuals and businesses from around the world who share a vision of growing a mature, stable, transparent and fair crypto-asset industry. The desire and commitment of the community to instil and drive sound business practices is enormously compelling and in our experience, is far more prevalent than those who do not ascribe to this mindset.”"

as a medium for everyday consumer transactions, price volatility ...","Nov 19, 2018","This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision","In the year of bear markets and curbed enthusiasm, stablecoins have emerged as the asset class with which many of the crypto community associate high hopes for the long-anticipated mass adoption. As these cryptocurrencies have come to be viewed as a promising tool to alleviate volatility – presumably the major hurdle in the way of digital assets becoming a vehicle of everyday transactions for millions of consumers – they enjoy massive media coverage, community and investor attention, and merit somewhat over-the-top labels such as “The Holy Grail of cryptocurrencies.”Yet great success comes with great responsibility, and increased public attention has brought increased scrutiny on many of the more salient projects, resulting in a pool of pointed criticisms. These arguments deserve a thorough review by anyone who aspires to keep up with the developments in the segment of the crypto industry that perhaps moves even faster than others.As any other important sector in the field, the stablecoin space presents a major ideological battlefield for crypto purists and crypto pragmatists. The models that have gained the most traction to date – namely, the fiat-backed stablecoins such as Tether – are also those that sacrifice the traditional virtues of decentralization and antagonism toward the legacy of financial system. Pragmatists believe that, albeit they indeed may be the artifacts of the centralized economy, asset-backed stablecoins can spark adoption and serve as a bridge between the incumbent economy and its more decentralized future.Speaking to Cointelegraph, Eric Ervin, the Founder and CEO of the financial firm Blockforce Capital, summarized this outlook:“The true value that asset-backed stablecoins bring to the blockchain industry is that they will provide a realistic solution for the use of cryptocurrency in everyday transactions. For all the promise and hype surrounding Bitcoin and various other altcoins as a medium for everyday consumer transactions, price volatility and a lack of widespread understanding has curbed mass adoption. Stablecoins offer a viable solution as anyone that has used a credit card or made an electronic funds transfer has essentially already used and can understand ‘e-cash.’ Stablecoins offer the ability to decrease settlement times from days to seconds and remove many, if not all, intermediaries, such as credit card networks, payment processors, clearing networks (e.g., ACH, RTP, SWIFT), and even banks.”Functional advantages notwithstanding, a large share of the crypto community would never rally behind any centralized currency that is pegged to the U.S. dollar. Over the last several months, an enthusiastic movement of developers determined to produce viable decentralized alternatives came up with a variety of often ingenious and complex stablecoin designs. These models either use other digital assets as collateral, or are not collateralized at all, relying instead on algorithmic mechanisms of price stabilization.As much as they are distinct in terms of design, volatility-reducing mechanisms utilized, and faithfulness to the tenets of crypto anarchism, these types of stablecoins are different in the ways they could fail.Off-chain collateral designs: TetherThe problems with fiat-backed cryptocurrencies, of which Tether (#8 according to CoinMarketCap.com at the time of this writing) is an unavoidable example, are all well known. Tether is centrally governed, which means that users have to trust the company that issues the asset entirely. At the same time, the Tether user agreement explicitly states that the system does not “guarantee any right of redemption or exchange of Tethers by us for money.” For someone who is not a priori excited about cryptocurrencies, this could be enough to render the idea of exchanging proper U.S. government-backed dollars for some digital tokens a questionable one. Finally, the entity behind the asset claims that every USDT in circulation is backed by one U.S. dollar in the back account, but failed to undergo a proper third-party audit so far. As Eric Ervin puts it:“Tether still lacks the operational standards competitors are promising. A huge head start will only take them so far and Tether has been reluctant to provide information about the soundness of the USD reserves backing USDT until Tether provides a full, unbiased attestation of USDT’s soundness, they will have a long way to go to establish legitimacy with institutional organizations.”Speaking of fiat-backed stablecoins more generally, Rafael Delfin, Head of Research at Brave New Coin, voices centralization concerns:“We consider this emerging type of crypto asset of great significance to further the development of the ecosystem. However, not all stablecoins are created equal, as some projects allow issuers to freeze funds. I personally favor the projects building stablecoin protocols that embrace Bitcoin's core values of decentralization, algorithmic issuance, and censorship resistance.”Yet despite all these woes, Tether has an undeniable upper hand over its more sophisticated and more decentralized competitors: it has been live for a while now, and, with a capitalization of over $1.5 billion, it enjoys a relatively wide global use. This alone is a reason to consider it viable and useful.Nevin Freeman, co-founder of Reserve, spoke with Cointelegraph from Angola, where he is currently discussing with local banks and telecom carriers a roadmap for making cryptocurrency a reality there. The weapon of choice would be a fiat-backed stablecoin:“Yes, we think Angola is a place where stable cryptocurrency really makes sense to hold and use. Most developed nations don't really need it right now. We think that ‘fiatcoins’ are the best available stablecoins right now, but that their days may be numbered since governments can decide to shut them off, and have done so for equivalent virtual currencies in the past.”Speaking of the possibility of collapse, Freeman explained that the users of off-chain collateral coins face two major types of risks: the counterparty risk, which has to do with the need to trust that those who manage the money centrally will act in good will, and the third-party risk, which is about outside actors such as hackers and governments posing a threat to users’ money. The latter threat, Freeman hints, is a real one. However, he believes that such a scenario for fiat-pegged assets would be less dreadful than the potential collapse of their more decentralized alternatives:“I think the asset-backed coins may get shut down but most likely in an orderly way.”Digital asset collateral designs: DaiThis class of stablecoins comprises those assets that are pegged to other cryptocurrencies or baskets of them. The Dai Stablecoin is issued and controlled by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) called Maker. Even though Dai’s price also mirrors that of the U.S. dollar, it is actually backed by ETH. In order to obtain Dai, users would have to transfer ETH, which will be locked by the DAO. The system relies on a decentralized price-feed “oracle” to adjust the token value.  As with other crypto-backed stablecoins, Dai’s major potential point of failure comes from volatility inherent to collateral assets – from routine “collateral volatility,” to vulnerability, to so-called “black swan” events, whereby the value of the underlying asset dramatically collapses at a speed faster than the system can sustain.  With regard to Dai itself, stablecoin sceptics such as Preston Byrne often point out that the token is overcollateralized to ETH, so that creating $1 worth of Dai will take >$1 worth of ETH. Byrne is convinced that this does little beyond increasing users’ exposure to the value of the underlying coin – and, by extension, to its volatility. However, thorough analysis of the Maker protocol suggests that the model is robust and capable of ensuring stability. Researchers at Reserve believe that while Dai lacks price stabilization mechanisms and will be unable to scale to become a global solution, it has sufficient checks to keep investors safe from catastrophic price crashes.Non-collateralized designs: BasisFinally, some developers choose to avoid pegging their stablecoins to other assets altogether. Instead, they might design self-sustaining models that incorporate additional layers of game-theoretic incentives to encourage self-interested user behavior that would be instrumental in sustaining the peg. Perhaps the most famous representative of this cohort, Basis, relies on two types of assets that coexist on the platform: proper stablecoins and supporting bonds. If the coin’s price goes below the designated peg level, the system issues bonds that it sells to coin holders, who are supposed to be attracted by the perspective of being paid interest from the future coin issuance. Meanwhile, the coins used to buy the bonds are destroyed, thus reducing supply and driving the price back up.As many observers point out, this incentive structure is clearly premised on the expectation that the platform will grow indefinitely, which is not warranted. The bond payout to a user depends on how many other users are subsequently drawn to the system, so in order for the protocol to work as expected, coin holders have to share unquestioned faith in it. Moreover, as a study by Reserve analysts highlights, Basis’ strategy stipulates an initial period of off-chain stabilization, i.e. pegging to fiat for some time before switching to full on-chain stabilization. The plan also suggests that on this off-chain stage the coin will be backed by no more than 80 percent of the actual value, leading the researchers to expect that “under conditions that are arguably quite likely, the peg is likely to fail irrecoverably.”As this brief survey demonstrates, existing stablecoin models represent a spectrum of tradeoffs between functionality, scalability, and decentralization, and offer varying levels of security and vulnerability to failures. Intensifying competition in the field will definitely push the more viable designs to the surface, and there is hope that eventually solutions that are at the same time secure, scalable, and decentralized will emerge in the market. Meanwhile, experts look at the sector’s near prospects rather optimistically. As Brave New Coin’s, Rafael Delfin, points out,“Year-over-year Tether's market capitalization has grown 4x and its 24-hour volume has increased by 10x. We do expect similar growth for the entire stable coin sector, and while strong network effects and first mover advantage will still be at play, these factors will be less relevant for assets that are almost perfect substitutes.”Eric Ervin echoes this sentiment:“We firmly believe that consolidation will take place and the projects that survive will be the ones that garner the most adoption. While the stablecoin market doesn’t have to be a winner take all environment, market cap will be won by having more trust than the competition. That competition will only help increase interest and confidence, and in-turn adoption of the asset class.”Yet the road to wide adoption will certainly be a rocky one. As Nevin Freeman reminds, it is critical to avoid hasty steps, as both people’s money and reputation of the crypto industry at large will be on the line:“We think the some of these coins will fail, and that this could be very bad. Why? Because people in Angola and other places with high inflation will be the ones holding them, and it would be really bad to decimate the savings of people in that kind of situation. So we feel an immense responsibility to get people in the industry to not mess things up, and we are scrambling to figure out how to do that. In addition to being really bad for those people, it could be really bad for the cryptocurrency movement, since the first major real-world use case of crypto could lead to financial catastrophe, giving regulators the political will to shut things down.”"

Per the company’s website, it processes 38,300 claims per day and has nearly 519,000 accounts in mutual funds.State Farm is working on blockchain-based solution to speed up the subrogation processes in the insurance industry. Subrogation is a legal right held by most insurance carriers to legally pursue a third party that caused an insurance loss to the insured, and is usually the last part of an insurance claims process.State Farm is reportedly testing a blockchain solution collaboratively with another insurer, to see whether it can reduce the time needed to complete the subrogation process by automatically compiling all subrogation payment amounts.According to Mike Fields, State Farm’s innovation executive, “subrogation is a relatively manual, time-consuming process often requiring physical checks to be mailed on a claim-by-claim basis between insurers.” He added:“It [blockchain] helps us automate a manual process securely and creates a permanent transaction record of each payment which can easily be verified for accuracy. It also has the potential to decrease the amount of time for consumers to receive their deductible reimbursement.”Insurance companies globally have been integrating blockchain technology into their operations. Last month, Japanese insurance company Sompo partnered with pan-African digital payment platform BTC Africa, also known as BitPesa. The partnership is focused on the “digitalization of global remittance services.”In September, major insurance firm the People's Insurance Company of China (PICC) partnered with blockchain platform VeChain and global quality assurance and risk management company DNV GL to make their business more time and cost efficient. The partnership also aims improve fraud prevention, Know Your Customer (KYC) compliance, as well as the claims experience.Meanwhile, market research firm MarketsandMarkets predicted that blockchain in insurance market will grow to $1.4 billion by the end of 2023, at a compound annual growth rate of 84.9 percent."

Twelve initial partners have also joined the project, including such industry players as secure identity ecosystem firm Civic and blockchain protocol Aion.While forming the database, Messari will purportedly collect basic information voluntarily disclosed by the participating parties about their token design, supply details, technical issues, as well as investors and advisors. The profiles will reportedly be free of access within the industry. The release further explains:“With the launch of the Messari registry, token projects will finally have a common platform that helps them better communicate material updates with both their existing communities and external stakeholders...”Ryan Selkis, the CEO of Messari, stated that transparency is critical for the development of the crypto economy. He noted that participating projects “share our vision that the information they provide should remain freely accessible to all market participants, rather than locked behind the paywall of any single data provider.”Other organizations in the cryptocurrency space have also formed self-regulatory and development bodies. In April, sixteen Japanese licensed exchange operators took steps to launch the Japanese Cryptocurrency Exchange Association (JCEA). Plans began surfacing in February from two industry entities whose members now make up the JCEA — the Japan Blockchain Association (JBA) and Japan Cryptocurrency Business Association (JCBA).A study by international law firm Foley & Lardner LLP published in June revealed that 86 percent of cryptocurrency firms’ executives and investors want the industry to self-regulate. A total of 89 percent of respondents saw the need for “formalized” self-regulation, with a slightly lower majority considering that these formalized standards should have regulatory oversight from authorities."

Crypto Market Trading — Inside ...","Nov 20, 2018","Initial Coin Offerings (ICO) are facing a regulatory “compliance trilemma,” according to a recent study released Nov. 19. The research, funded by regtech platform iComply and “supported by” Canadian non-profit national research organization Mitacs Canada, was carried out by the University of British Columbia (UBC).","To prepare the report, UBC’s research team investigated the ICO space over the course of six months, focusing primarily on North America, but also delving into some other countries and jurisdictions. The team conducted 45 qualitative interviews with individuals in the ICO space, including representatives of the finance, law, and science sectors of the field.Per the study, ICO issuers face a “trilemma,” wherein they can only address two of three objectives at a time, those being “having a compliant offering,” “reaching a distributed pool of investors,” in a manner that is “cost-effective.” The researchers define compliance as following regulations in the home jurisdiction of both the issuer and investor.While a broadly distributed pool of investors is said to be the principal benefit of an ICO as a funding mechanism, the cost of complying with financial regulators becomes “much greater” if the investor pool becomes more distributed.“If issuers forgo these costs, the risk of being non-compliant rises significantly. The result is a trilemma, whereby issuers currently must forgo one of these goals to realize the other two, or to compromise on all three,” the study explains.The trilemma further reveals four basic approaches available to ICO issues, which are “the Maverick ICO,” “the Private ICO,” “the Hybrid ICO,” and no ICO at all. The first option refers to ignoring compliance for maximizing ICO reach and cost effectiveness, which reportedly runs a huge risk of regulatory enforcement.The second approach focuses on targeting only accredited and institutional investors by sacrificing distribution, which may not affect cost-effectiveness but raise challenges in secondary market trading control.Regarding the Hybrid ICO, the report reads that it “compromise[s] on all three dimensions by issuing in select markets, resulting in bounded cost effectiveness, compliance and investor scope,” resulting in a combination of risks.The researchers found that companies wishing to undergo an ICO sought relief from the trilemma through relevant regulatory authorities. Participants in the study reportedly called for amendments to regulation, including clarifications of existing regulation and development of “fundamentally new” regulatory definitions and frameworks.The study concludes that this “trilemma” has “substantially limited [the] potential” of ICOs, noting:“Many actors with legitimate ventures that could benefit from ICOs are likely holding back, due to combination of confusion over how exactly they might comply with financial regulations within and across jurisdictions, and the prohibitive costs of doing so manually.”As Cointelegraph recently reported, ICO performance in the third quarter of 2018 was in part characterized by “overall disappointment,"" in comparison with previous quarters.Last week, Cointelegraph reported that in a self-described “first,” the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had imposed civil penalties against two ICOs over their failure to register their token sales with the agency."

The platform has its own cryptocurrency and has been developed by the LastRoots corporation, famous for its  popular cryptocurrency exchange.The c0ban.tv platform publishes short video ads, already with over 50,000 active users and 5 million transactions per month, according to the startup team.The concept of c0ban is based on combining blockchain and video advertisement. The core idea of c0ban is that a user can get paid with c0ban coins (RYO) for watching advertisement videos posted on c0ban’s web application.This c0ban mechanism is similar to websites that offer reward points to their users. In order to get rewards, a user needs to sign in to the c0ban.tv web application and watch the videos that appear on the screen.There are three huge problems for the video advertising market that the industry faces right now: Users tend to skip video ads, they do not watch them in full and the current ads are not cost effective. According to the c0ban team, their application and platform can solve these problems by paying users to watch videos.According to c0ban fans blog, there are stores in Japan that accept RYO. Users can, for instance, watch a few videos, get paid with c0ban cryptos and buy lunch with those coins. Although the number of such stores is still quite small, LastRoots is actively working to expand, a company’s representative told Cointelegraph.“C0ban is named after a Middle Ages Samurai coin, named Koban. C0ban is the first challenge for us to spread the technology to the world. We will be pleased if we could provide a trigger to people to feel the revolutionary world of decentralized consensus,” reads the c0ban website.According to the website, c0ban is a proof-of-work (PoW) cryptocurrency that is designed to make it easy for everyone to enter the blockchain world. The genesis block was mined on Dec. 15, 2016 and so far over 26,000,000 RYO have been issued. The target number is 88,000,000 RYO.С0ban.tv held one of the first ICOs in Japan in July 2016 and succeeded in raising about $6 million. Its app was released in February 2017, with the cryptocurrency listed on a Japanese exchange in March 2017. Today, the c0ban trade volume has reached 100 million trades.On December, c0ban will be listed on the Latoken exchange and will be able to be traded for Bitcoin and Ethereum. The c0ban cryptocurrency has been on the market since Dec. 15, 2016, when it was officially launched. The c0ban startup team has decided to move forward and expand worldwide, making its way to a broader audience.Disclaimer. Cointelegraph does not endorse any content or product on this page.

Opting for a centralized platform means they run the risk of being exposed to security vulnerabilities, but decentralized alternatives have had the disadvantage of being sluggish – with slow speeds and the lack of scalability making them impractical for use on a major level.BEXAM plans to offer tailor-made solutions to enterprise-level businesses – and firmly believes that blockchain has the potential to become the beating heart of mainstream society.Its executives believe that targeting larger companies will create a trickle-down effect where blockchain becomes increasingly relevant. By exposing greater numbers of entrepreneurs to its potential, and proving what the technology has to offer, BEXAM thinks “relevant, everyday uses of blockchain [will] emerge more and more.”A rethink of its organization has resulted in a rebrand – with a new logo and a refreshed website that informs visitors of its objectives for the future.Explaining the bold decision to move away from its original plans, the company wrote in a blog post: “Exchanges were available left and right, and while our technology was definitely significant, there weren’t many other distinctive factors to put us above the rest of the competition.“If we threw ourselves into the sea of exchanges, we would only get swept away and our technology’s potential would never truly be revealed.”Despite the change in focus, BEXAM stresses it will welcome startups “with a similar philosophy and desire to build applications” using its platform.According to the company, the dizzying speeds that BEXAM’s network is capable of achieving are thanks to a consensus algorithm known as Proof of Rounds (PoR,) which was developed by a Japanese engineering team.BEXAM’s PoR algorithm generates blocks in order rather than at random, and functions based on a hierarchy of Master Nodes, Super Nodes and Normal Nodes. It also optimizes node productivity as a result of allocating hierarchal jobs/specializations to nodes.DAG stands for “directed acyclic graph” – and according to BEXAM’s white paper, the network structure of this distinctive technology means that “the number of nodes in each layer increases automatically, allowing information to be transmitted without major speed reduction.”BEXAM has provided a table which compares the maximum number of transactions per second it can handle to other systems. While Bitcoin can manage 7 TPS and Ethereum musters 20 – with mainstream rivals such as PayPal and VISA managing 450 and 56,000 TPS respectively – BEXAM’s algorithm can handle 40 million.The Proof of Rounds algorithm was devised by a development company known as Early Works, and BEXAM has an exclusive partnership agreement to build a platform based on this concept.A token which is native to BEXAM’s ecosystem, known as BXA, will serve as a way for enterprises to pay network usage fees and transaction fees.A private token sale for BXA is taking place from Nov 19 to 29, with a public IEO sale to be announced soon.Disclaimer.

How much faith do you left to (sic) have?” the post reads, continuing:“Now, Starteos is still gonna stay with YOU, our most important and best friends! And we gonna share the proceeds with you and make through the difficulties together.”After selecting Starteos as a proxy, users can pick “stable income” “mining” revenue mode or the “random revenue” mode, where they play “Lucky Fruit Slots Machine” with game tokens to get “EOS revenue.”The post added information on how users can vote for it as part of EOS’ Block Producer voting rubric.As Finance Magnates noted Dec. 3, effectively paying off users to strengthen a particular node would constitute heavy centralization on the part of EOS, one of the world’s biggest-value blockchain networks.Cointelegraph has often reported on the controversies linked to various participants in the ecosystem, the most recent involving moderators, one of whom in November reversed transactions from a reportedly phished account, which nodes had already confirmed.Creator Daniel Larimer, who in October said decentralization was not in fact the goal of EOS, last week revealed was considering plans to start a new currency-focused token.“Crypto people will hate it,” he wrote about the concept on social media.EOS remains the blockchain which has by far the highest number of daily transactions, despite a decline in token price. As of press time, EOS is trading for $2.83 according to CoinMarketCap, down more than 14 percent on the week, with a total market cap of around $2.6 billion."

These reportedly include “misunderstandings,” or an “immature and imbalanced” view of the technology’s application across various industries and scenarios, and insufficient cultivation of blockchain talent, which it notes is especially needed to train standardization practitioners.The author calls on the country to expedite standardization, as the technology’s potential applications continue to extend beyond the bounds of finance to supply chain management, social welfare, the culture and entertainment industries, and other fields.The author further recommends that China “seize the opportunity to play a key role in the international development of blockchain standards,” while drawing upon and reformulating these international standards for China’s situation.As previously reported, China has been ratcheting up its efforts to complete a blockchain standardization system “as soon as possible,” creating a dedicated government committee for the express purpose, and most recently announcing standards should be issued by the end of 2019."
