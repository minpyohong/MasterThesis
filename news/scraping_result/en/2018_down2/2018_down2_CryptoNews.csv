November 19, 2018
","This past week, we saw heavy declines in bitcoin below the USD 6,000 support area. BTC/USD remained in a bearish zone and opened with a negative tone this week. The price recently broke the USD 5,500 support and traded to a new 2018 low. Similarly, ethereum was under a lot of selling pressure as it broke the USD 175 support. It is currently (UTC 08:30 AM) down more than 10% and it seems like sellers are in control below USD 160. Both BCHABC and BCHSV declined heavily below the USD 250 and USD 100 supports respectively. The current market sentiment is clearly bearish and it seems like bitcoin could extend declines towards USD 5,000 in the coming sessions.","Total market capitalization There were heavy bearish moves below the USD 5,600 level in bitcoin price . BTC/USD traded below the USD 5,550 and USD 5,400 support levels recently to move further into a bearish zone. A new 2018 high was formed near USD 5,300 and it seems like the price could continue to move down in the near term.
The main weekly support level is at USD 5,000, below which there is an open space up to USD 4,400. On the upside, an immediate resistance is at USD 5,500, above which the price could recover towards the USD 5,750 level. The key weekly resistance is at USD 6,000, which was a crucial support earlier.Ethereum price  fell during the past few hours and declined below the USD 170 and USD 160 support levels. ETH/USD is currently down around 13% to USD 155.
An immediate support is at USD 150, below which the price could tumble towards the USD 130 level. On the upside, an initial resistance is at USD 170, above which the price could test USD 180. The main weekly hurdle for buyers is near the USD 195 level.Both Bitcoin cash  coins are down significantly. BCHABC is down around 15% and it recently traded below the USD 250 support. The next major support for buyers is near the USD 200 level. BCHSV collapsed and declined roughly 30% to USD 90. If it continues to decline, it could test the USD 80 level in the near term.
Ripple price  recovered recently, but buyers failed to hold gains above the USD 0.520 and USD 0.505 levels. XRP/USD followed bitcoin√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s path and declined around 5%. It is currently trading near USD 0.475 and it could test the USD 0.450 level.Many altcoins declined heavily and registered losses between 15%-20%, including LRC, ICX, WAN, AION, ELF, SRN, VET, IOST and MKR. Out of these, LRC is down 18% and ICX declined 17%.To sum up, bitcoin and altcoins moved further into the red zone. BTC/USD may perhaps continue to decline towards USD 5,000 and if buyers fail to defend more losses, the price could tumble. Similarly, ethereum must stay above the USD 150 level to avoid a drop towards the USD 130 and USD 125 levels in the near future.

December 04, 2018
","As many Bitcoin miners have turned off their machines, mining difficulty saw its second largest drop in history at -15% on December 3rd. It has helped to increase profitability for those who still run their mining rigs, but strengthened fears of centralization. ","The mining difficulty of Bitcoin is adjusted every two weeks (every 2016 blocks, to be precise) to maintain the normal 10-minute block time. This means that if there are many miners competing amongst themselves and propagating blocks in less than ten minutes, the difficulty of the next puzzle will be increased; if there are few miners and it takes them much longer to find a solution, the difficulty is decreased - both times just enough to keep block times at around 10 minutes. Now, the difficulty might drop another 16% after two weeks, according to estimations by major mining pool BTC.com. In that case, it would almost reach the difficulty levels seen in May/June. According to previous reports, between 600,000 and 800,000 Bitcoin miners have pulled the plug on their operations in the second half of November. Market analysis firm Autonomous Research estimates that at least 100,000 individual miners have shut down, and advisory firm Fundstrat Global Advisors adds that since early September, about 1.4 million servers have been unplugged, Bloomberg reported on Monday. This flush out took the Bitcoin‚Äôs hash rate (or computing power) with it, as it is down 36% from its all-time high this September.As reported, miners are under growing pressure as the bitcoin price dropped by 80% since its all-time high in December of 2017. In November bitcoin lost 37% of its value, dropping below USD 4,000. The CEO of China-based crypto mining pool F2Pool Shixing Mao said back in September that the break-even point for Bitcoin mining was between USD 3,891 and USD 11,581, depending on the equipment being used. At that time, BTC traded for around USD 6,400. However, popular economist and Bitcoin investor Tuur Demeester stressed: ""Bitcoin Mining breakeven cost"" is confusing as a general concept, because it implies a static BTC revenue per hash. However hashrate rewards adjust dynamically, via biweekly difficulty adjustment and the fee market.With the mining difficulty down as well, the remaining miners should have an easier job. However, Malachi Salcido, head of Wenatchee, one of the largest North American miners, told Bloomberg that only a select few can afford to stay in the game: miners with scale, very specific business models and extremely low electricity costs, which is the case in Douglas County where his own miners are based. Margins before costs like depreciation and taxes dropped from about 40% to 20% during the slide, but they jumped back up at the company to around 40% as smaller rivals shuttered operations, Salcido said.However, some fear a 51% attack in case some of the remaining mining companies decide to band together. The community is much more optimistic, though: they remind that the biggest ever drop of -18% back in 2011 brought to a price increase of 150% - from USD 2 to USD 5 in around 60 days. Although many say that previous patterns are no guarantee for the future - ‚ÄúJust because it happened before, it does not mean it will happen again,‚Äù writes Reddit user u/Red5point1 - not all agree with that sentiment. As u/Mowglio points out, ‚ÄúSure, historical data does not guarantee future results, but it is literally what all scientific analysis is based on. Throwing it to the wind as if it doesn't matter is one of the dumbest things you can do.‚Äù

December 10, 2018
","Everyone has their own guess as to what Bitcoin will be worth in any amount of time. However, some predictions garner special attention: for example, software tycoon John McAfee first said Bitcoin would reach USD 500,000 by the end of 2020 and promised he‚Äôd eat his external genitalia on national television if that doesn‚Äôt happen, later amending his prediction to say it‚Äôd go up to USD 1 million while the previous promise still stands. Because this is the internet, there is a website that follows McAfee‚Äôs prediction and measures how much Bitcoin would have to rise for McAfee‚Äôs nethers to stay intact.","Also, the website, called bircoin.top, lets you add your own parameters to see how your own prediction would pan out, or even check other famous predictions. __McAfee announced his prediction on July 17th, 2017, and according to mathematics, the price would need to grow at a rate of around 0.5% per day from that day on to reach the predicted million. Although half a percent may not sound like much, it is still an exponential growth curve that gets steeper the further it goes. With this steady growth rate, Bitcoin would have to be worth USD 26,400 today for it to be on track for the end of 2020 - but it is scarcely above USD 3,500, around 86% less than what the prediction needs, or around 416 days behind.And there are many predictions: from Tom Lee, of Fundstrat Advisors, expecting USD 15,000 per bitcoin by the end of 2018, to Tim Draper betting on USD 250,000 per bitcoin by 2022. Meanwhile, data analyst Nick Maggiulli says that their mistake was making a prediction in the first place. ‚ÄúYou CANNOT predict chaotic systems,‚Äù he adds in a tweet.Where did all these people go wrong?   When they made a Bitcoin price prediction in the first place. You CANNOT predict chaotic systems.  It‚Äôs the Three Body Problem. pic.twitter.com/IeMJQ761SwCo-founder of first Chinese cryptocurrency exchange BTCC, Bobby Lee, took to Twitter to share his own opinion and ask the community to do the same.If history repeats perfectly, then the current bear market for #Bitcoin would bottom out at $2,500 next month, in Jan 2019.And then the next rally would start in late 2020, peak out in Dec 2021 at $333,000, and then crash back down to $41,000 in Jan 2023.Something like that?üôÇ https://t.co/M8ljIVnt73Later, Lee asked his followers whether this will happen - 59% of respondents believe in this, by the way, and over half believe that the peak of USD 333,000 is the least likely to happen out of all four predictions.However, all this proves is that anyone can make predictions. The community has always been skeptical, however, and many predictions (and the people making them) are notoriously wrong. Still, if you‚Äôre craving some fun, make your own prediction - there are no prerequisites to it - and if you get something right, maybe you‚Äôll get famous."

__________","Nicholas Merten, a.k.a DataDash, is a young entrepreneur with libertarian ideas and one of the most popular YouTubers in the crypto industry with over 315,000 subscribers.  Here is what he has to say about himself and his journey into crypto.When people ask you ‚ÄúWhat is your job?‚Äù, what do you answer?My job is to take the interests that I share with my audience to the next level. On a daily basis, I spend hours researching cryptocurrency and other markets such as equities, commodities, and traditional currencies. The reason I do this is because I trade markets from a macro perspective. I‚Äôm trying to give a big picture and show how intermingled crypto is with the world‚Äôs economy. It's rare that someone can turn their passion into their day-to-day job, but I‚Äôm one of those lucky individuals. How did you get into crypto? I found out about Bitcoin in 2011. At the time, I was trying to understand the global financial system and I was going back to the same conclusion that we need to find an alternative system that would not leave banking institutions with the mantle of responsibility over our money. Then, by chance, I stumbled upon Bitcoin. Sadly, my cynical nature kept me from exploring the technology further and for years I had no idea what it is. This was the case until 2016, when I read the Bitcoin whitepaper. It was like a slap in the face. I wasn't mad that I missed a wonderful investment opportunity, rather, I was upset that the important thing in dismantling the archaic banking system had been in front of my eyes for years.What is your educational and professional background?For more than seven years, I've immersed myself in just about every documentary, book, and Medium in order to understand economics, finance, business, and politics. Just a few years ago, I was pursuing a double major in business with a focus on finance, however, even ending the last semester of my freshman year with a 3.5 GPA, I dropped out. Then I joined Praxis [a 12 month startup apprenticeship], which lead me to working for a startup in Silicon Valley and founding the largest channel on cryptocurrencies.The first DataDash YouTube video that we found was posted on July 12th 2017. Is it the first crypto video you ever made?Yes, and with great humility, I thought no one would ever care to watch it.What was your initial goal with this channel? Is it still the same?The original goal of my channel was to teach people data analytics and SQL [a domain-specific language used in programming.] The channel was a part of a personal development project for an educational platform as I was pursuing a career in data analytics. However, it turned out that my two videos I did on crypto markets were very popular for a channel with no subscribers. So, I kept doing my research and producing videos. The rest is history. I would have never guessed that people would want to hear me ramble about markets on a daily basis.I've started to provide more of a macro-perspective in my videos, covering different areas of finance, such as the stock market and commodities. This was not only to broaden content I produce, but also to demonstrate how many of these markets correlate with crypto, which excites me the most.In your opinion, what problems cryptocurrencies could fix? Many believe that blockchain will help revolutionize the way companies operate, and I don't doubt it will. However, I feel that crypto will mostly affect even more important thing in our daily live - it‚Äôs currencies. Controlled by central authorities, traditional currencies have yet to see challengers to their dominance. Now, as many economies are experiencing debt, currency, and geopolitical crises, I think it's only a matter of time until we see a massive wealth transfer from fiat to the new era of decentralized cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrency properties such as immutability, censorship resistance, and finite supply will change the game.If you had a chance, what would you tell Satoshi Nakamoto?""Thank you for giving me hope that financial sovereignty in the 21st century can become a reality. Are you satisfied where Bitcoin is heading?""

","Do you want to leave an immutable message for future generations? Then check out the Blockchainsareforever.com project. It‚Äôs not the best service for private messaging as every single message is recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain, which means that they are public and can never be modified or deleted.","This fun service isn‚Äôt that revolutionary, as it has been possible to add messages on the Bitcoin blockchain since its inception. For example, Satoshi Nakamoto, the mysterious creator of Bitcoin, included this message in the Genesis Block, or the first-ever block of Bitcoin: ""The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks."" Meanwhile, this year, TD Ameritrade, an online broker, planted their literal flag on the Bitcoin‚Äôs blockchain, effectively making an advertisement for themselves.However, ‚ÄúBlockchains are forever‚Äù makes this much easier. Just type in your message, choose whether you want your message to show on the Bitcoin blockchain or testnet, choose your payment method (via the Lightning Network or the regular Bitcoin payment), pay, and voil√°! Your message is ‚Äúimmortalized.‚ÄùThis is what people are sending into eternity:It won‚Äôt cost you a lot to try ‚ÄúBlockchains are forever‚Äù as sending one message is less than 5 US dollar cents. However, you are only allowed to send 80 characters in a single message. So, if you are planning to add a wall of text to the Bitcoin blockchain, be sure to stock up with BTC first.Cryptonews.com covered two similarly creative crypto projects previously. The first one is Steem Whale, which allows you to make an artificial whale fountain squirt by sending the Steem cryptocurrency. Another fun project is Satoshi‚Äôs Place, a graffiti board to show the power and capabilities of the Lightning Network. There‚Äôre one million pixels on the canvas with each costing 1 satoshi to paint. Even if you draw something large, it won‚Äôt cost you a lot. But be aware: others can respray your art!Hower, immutability of public blockchains is being used to send serious messages, also. As reported in April, activists have posted a student of Peking University's #MeToo movement letter on the Ethereum blockchain in an attempt to avoid government censorship."

Mario Gibney, Blockstream, a blockchain startup, employee and co-host of the Unhashed Podcast, just offered one of those stories by sharing his personal experience and telling how Bitcoin has changed his life for better.  Originally shared on Twitter, you can read about Mario‚Äôs journey below.*Deep breath*When I look back over the past 3 years, it is staggering how much my life has changed, and Bitcoin was a huge factor in that. Late 2015/early 2016 was the darkest period of my life.I was falling further into debt failing out of a university program I didn't yet realize I hated, my social life was little more than getting drunk several nights a week, and I had no constructive hobbies - nights alone were often spent compulsively playing computer games.I felt like I hadn't made progress on any long-term plans in years. Serious depression had started to take hold, which led to increasingly erratic sleeping patterns. My ability to focus was almost non-existent, as was my appetite.I knew things had gotten really bad by January 2016 when I found myself contemplating suicide.
I started seeking psychotherapy, and thanks to that and the support of my friends and family, I managed to stabilize myself, bit by bit, in the following months.Realizing how it was draining me, I quit my studies. But I was still generally aimless, in debt, and with a ton of time on my hands.That spring, this thing called 'bitcoin' popped back into my mind. About a year earlier, a guy I'd met at a bar had raved about it.I hopped on meetup and was excited to find an English-speaking Bitcoin group only a 15 minute walk from my apartment. (In a city like Seoul, that's basically next door.) I showed up to @seoulbitcoin for my first meetup in May 2016, and was hooked from the start.The Bitcoin meetup in Seoul, 2016:Bitcoin itself is interesting. But a bigger deal for me was the people there. You couldn't ask for a better person than @SomsenRuben to welcome newcomers and show them the ropes.I remembered that once upon a time I had been interested in computers other as a means to argue on internet forums, so I started learning coding. Having experts like @BenMcDonald___ and @abeikverdi give me tips and guidance as I struggled with C++ was invaluable.Soon after me, @Sanket1729 showed up as another regular, and he patiently filled in more of my technical gaps in comprehension.I suddenly had friends and a hobby that challenged me intellectually. Instead of obsessively slamming beers and hoping to get laid, weekend hours were spent huddled in a cafe, figuring out why the UTXO set was important, or why deploying SegWit was so complicated.When alone, I progressed from video games, to binge-watching @aantonop presentations, to taking Dan Boneh's cryptography courses.There were still dark periods during those months. I grappled with visa uncertainties and the aftermath of a traffic accident. I would fall back into my old ways at times. But I always had something constructive to come back to.By 2017, things had started to look up a lot more. I had found myself a stable day-job teaching English again, and I rarely felt the urge to go clubbing on weekends.I had been lucky enough in 2016 to set aside an investment in bitcoin which by 2017 allowed me to pay off my remaining debts. I'll never forget that feeling of weight being lifted off my shoulders.As crypto-mania gripped Korea in 2017, our meetup grew more popular, and I built confidence as we took turns presenting to larger and larger groups of enthusiasts or curious visitors. I began to think maybe I could make a career out of this Bitcoin thing.The Bitcoin meetup in Seoul, 2017:Another turning point came in November 2017. After our meetup garnered a bit of attention for speaking out against the Segwit2x fork, @wtogami paid us a visit since he was in town.Before he left, I told him that I was planning to quit teaching soon to try to work somewhere in the Bitcoin industry. He responded with something along the lines of ""I don't know if we're hiring at the moment, but we can stay in touch.""I was rather embarrassed. I had just been asking if he knew of anywhere else that might take me. I wouldn't have even thought to apply to Blockstream - of course there were far more qualified people than me that they could choose from.As it turns out, Warren saw more in me than I did - he had been quite serious. Within two months, I was on a flight back to Canada for my final interview. That was January this year.As the new year approaches, I look back at where I was less than three short years ago, and it's overwhelming.It's incredible being welcomed and working alongside intimidatingly competent people like @larrybitcoin, @excellion, @selenejin, and many others (you know who you are if you're reading this).The depression still comes back at times, and startup life can be immensely stressful. Less than a month ago, I came close to fully burning out. But I have a deeper drive these days, and I can pick myself back up faster each time.My life is so much better in almost every way than any other time in my life, and I'm beyond grateful.Bitcoin certainly wasn't the only thing that dragged me out of that mess a few years back. The support of my loved ones, psychotherapy, and my own perseverance were huge.But yes, the bitcoin community and the people I've met along the way have been the kind of thing that make this whole life journey worthwhile."

November 27, 2018
","A module called event-stream, used in millions of web applications but notably in BitPay‚Äôs open-source Bitcoin wallet Copay has reportedly been compromised, potentially leaving some other wallets vulnerable as well. ","BitPay published an advisory saying Copay versions 5.0.2 through 5.1.0 were affected by the malicious code and that users with these versions installed should avoid running or opening the app until they install Copay version 5.2.0.‚ÄúOur team is continuing to investigate this issue and the extent of the vulnerability,‚Äù the official announcement reads. ‚ÄúCurrently, we have only confirmed that the malicious code was deployed on versions 5.0.2 through 5.1.0 of our Copay and BitPay apps. However, the BitPay app was not vulnerable to the malicious code. We are still investigating whether this code vulnerability was ever exploited against Copay users.‚ÄùCopay, the affected wallet, has more than 100,000 downloads of Android, while the number of users from other platforms like iOS or Windows is unknown.Any other wallets using this module might be affected as well, although as of the time of writing, none of them have come forward. The problem stems from a GitHub user volunteering to take over the library in question, inject malware and patch it up to avoid detection.The user, known only as ‚Äúright9ctrl,‚Äù took over maintenance of the module from its original creator, developer Dominic Tarr, who said that he had not maintained the repository in years. In short, the developer updated the module with malware and then hid it from view, but the numerous people who had already installed it remain affected. Well known developer Jameson Lopp explained: The npm ""event-stream"" repository has been compromised; if you are using it in a project along with ""copay-dash"" then the malware will steal any private keys it can find. https://t.co/fAnH6ik1n9___
Jackson Palmer, an Australian entrepreneur and technologist best known for creating the infamously successful ""joke"" cryptocurrency Dogecoin, added:This is one of the major issues with JavaScript-based cryptocurrency wallets with heavy up-stream dependencies coming from NPM. @BitPay essentially trusted all the up-stream developers to never inject malicious code into their wallet.@dominictarr also let the attacker in, sadlyEvent-stream is downloaded roughly two million times a week by application programmers for many different uses. The version with the malware in it, Event-Stream v 3.3.6, was published on September 9 via Node Package Manager (NPM) repository, and had since been downloaded by nearly 8 million application programmers. The malicious code supposedly attempted to steal digital coins stored in the Dash Copay Bitcoin wallets - distributed through the NPM - and transfer them to a server located in Kuala Lumpur. Officials from NPM removed the backdoor from NPM's listing on Monday this week."

","Bitcoin price started a short term correction recently after a drop below USD 3,800. BTC/USD corrected above USD 4,000 and USD 4,100, but it struggled to clear the USD 4,200 barrier. Later, the price declined again and settled below USD 4,000, which is a bearish sign. Similarly, ethereum price failed to break an important resistance near USD 120 and started a fresh downward move. Ripple price also struggled to gain traction above USD 0.400, resulting in bearish moves. Going forward, if bitcoin and altcoins struggle to break key pivot levels, there could be yet another bearish wave below recent lows in the near term.","Total market capitalization Recently, there was a recovery above the USD 4,000 resistance in bitcoin price , but buyers struggled to retain strength. BTC/USD topped near the USD 4,200 level and started a fresh downward move. It broke the USD 4,000 and USD 3,800 levels to move back in a bearish zone.
The price is down around 6% (UTC 08:30 AM) and it seems like it could decline further below the USD 3,750 and USD 3,620 support levels. In the worst case scenario, the price may even break the recent low and trade below the USD 3,500 level.Ethereum price  recovered more than USD 15, but it struggled near a crucial resistance at USD 120. ETH/USD faced a solid selling interest near USD 120, which resulted in a bearish reaction.
The price declined below USD 115 and USD 110 and it is currently down around 6%. An immediate support is at USD 105, below which there is a risk of a downside break below the key USD 100 support. The main resistances on the upside are at USD 115 and USD 120.Bitcoin cash  ABC rallied above the USD 200 and USD 220 resistance levels. However, BCHABC failed to stay above USD 200 and later declined heavily. The price is currently trading near USD 180 and it seems like it could test the USD 170 support. On the other hand, BCHSV rallied above the USD 100 level and traded as high as USD 140. It is currently consolidating above USD 100 with positive moves.
Ripple price  recovered above the USD 0.385 resistance, but it struggled to clear the USD 0.400 resistance. XRP/USD is down 5% to USD 0.358 and it could revisit the USD 0.340 support.Many small cap altcoins declined recently more than 10%, including SRN, FCT, MITH, STEEM, ONT, MAID, REP, WAN, GNT and ODE. Out of these, SRN declined around 26% and FCT is down nearly 25%.Overall, bitcoin price is back below the key USD 4,000 support, which is a bearish sign. If BTC/USD fails to jump above USD 4,000 and USD 4,200, there is a risk of more losses below the USD 3,500 level in the near term. Similarly, there could be an increase in selling pressure on altcoins like ethereum, ripple, BCH, neo and litecoin if they fail to start a fresh rebound in the next few hours.

The XYO Network aims to make it possible for smart contracts to access the real world by using its ecosystem of devices to determine if an object is at a specific coordinate and deploy specific smart contracts accordingly.In the past week, XYO Network has completed their gamma stage of the token sale and launched their mainnet, and claim to have received ‚Äúproposals from 10 leading exchanges thus far.‚Äù They go on to explain, ‚ÄúBy ‚Äòleading,‚Äô I mean they‚Äôre in the Top 100 Exchanges according to the exchange market cap listing websites.‚Äù The first one they accepted and went live on is LATOKEN, an exchange that has around USD 37 million in daily trading volume, trading against Bitcoin, Ethereum and Tether.The hype surrounding XYO Network started much earlier. In November, the first official full XYO Network transaction went through live on stage when they landed a drone next to their CEO using their own location data technology. However, more notable than the news they‚Äôve been announcing is the hype that‚Äôs been following them. Neither their Telegram channel nor dedicated subreddit have a large following - around 13,000 and 1,400 followers, respectively - but the community is certainly excited about the project. That‚Äôs the same vibe that their Twitter account and blog posts give: it seems like XYO does not see the bear market that‚Äôs brought everyone else down, and not a single post reads in a somber tone. All of them are excited, and interactive with their community."

December 05, 2018
",The cryptoverse just saw another example of a so-called 51% double spending attack and it might be not the last one. ,"This time, Vertcoin, a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency currently ranked 187th by market capitalization, has suffered four distinct 51% attacks that resulted in the malicious actor double-spending an estimated USD 100,000. According to a blog post by the company, the developers are close to implementing a fork to mitigate the damage.The incidents first started in October, with the first lasting from the 12th until the 18th of October. The last one started 29th November and was supposedly ongoing at the time of the report on December 2nd.Price chart of Vertcoin:‚ÄúI am not aware of the victim or culprit, but several members of the Vertcoin community and developers are keeping a close eye on the network and I would advise everyone to do the same thing,‚Äù wrote one of the Vertcoin developers in a Medium post addressing the issue, adding, ‚ÄúDifferent members of the team and community have approached exchanges with the request to increase deposit confirmations and the developers have been working on two bespoke algorithms.‚ÄùOne of the two algorithm changes - and what the team considers the more important one - is implementing stricter resistance to application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) chips, which can mine more efficiently than GPUs (graphics processing units) and CPUs (central processing units). The Vertcoin team argues that the usage of ASICs centralized the hashpower, or flooding the renting market with cheap hashrate, meaning that anyone who can afford to rent hashpower (or computing power) can perhaps stage a 51% attack on the network. The team‚Äôs official response concludes, ‚ÄúFinally, I want to say that Vertcoin is here to stay. We will NOT compromise on decentralization by implementing centralized controls and we will not give up on fighting ASICS. We ambitiously aim to become the dominant mining algorithm for GPUs in the future.‚ÄùAccording to Crypto51.app, a website that calculates how much a 51% attack might cost, one hour of such attack on Vertcoin costs USD 181.51% attacks occurred in Bitcoin Gold, Verge, and Monacoin earlier this year. ""This is merely another incident that shows that threat actors exist that are both resourced and sophisticated enough to execute this kind of attack,"" Mark Nesbitt, security engineer at Coinbase, wrote in Medium post.According to him, exchanges make an ideal target for this sort of attack.""This is because exchanges allow deposits to be quickly traded into different assets and then withdrawn. An attacker can make a soon-to-be-reversed deposit, trade for another asset, move the new asset off platform, and then reverse the original deposit,"" Nesbitt explained.He concludes that as long as exchanges are willing to provide customers with assets in response to the deposit of a reversible currency, there‚Äôs no reason for attackers to stop this behavior. ""Expect to see more of these attacks"", the security engineer said.____A malicious miner with enough computing power can mine enough coins in private, without telling anyone else, that their chain becomes the legitimate one. This is called selfish mining. When other miners find this longer, ‚Äúselfish‚Äù chain, they will discard the ‚Äúhonest‚Äù one that they‚Äôve been working on, thus also discarding any transactions in those blocks, and start working on the new one. This is called a chain reorganization, or ‚Äúreorg.‚Äù All reorgs have a ‚Äúdepth,‚Äù which is the number of blocks that were replaced, and a ‚Äúlength,‚Äù which is the number of new blocks that did the replacing.The discarded chain now contains transactions that are no longer valid, even though the funds potentially already went through - and including the same transaction in the new, longer chain means that the same funds are being spend again. This is called a double spending attack.In the case of Vertcoin, one of the reorgs went quite deep - with a depth of 307 blocks and a length of 310 blocks. The total number of reorgs, spanning these four incidents, was 22, and 15 of those included double spending. The total value of the double spends was over USD 100,000.

November 29, 2018
","Tumbling prices appear to have done little to deter Japanese businesses, banks and regulators in their efforts to breathe new life into the country‚Äôs cryptocurrency industry.","Exchanges have been leading the way, with DMM Bitcoin, a platform operating under a Financial Services Agency (FSA) license, announcing yesterday that it will cut margin trading leverages from 5:1 to 4:1 as of December 26. Margin trading refers to funds customers can access in order to increase their buying capacity.DMM Bitcoin‚Äôs move appears to demonstrate that exchanges are falling in line with the requirements of the self-regulating Japan Virtual Currency Exchange Association (JVCEA), an association comprising all of Japan‚Äôs FSA-registered platforms.As previously reported, the JVCEA has been pushing for its members to accept a margin trading leverages cap of 4:1 as of next year. DMM Bitcoin says it will introduce the new cap after it has completed scheduled maintenance work on its website. Elsewhere, there has been good news this week for customers of two exchanges crippled by hacks earlier this year. Fisco, the new owner of the Zaif platform, which was hit with a major hack in September has confirmed that customers whose money was stolen in the heist will be reimbursed by the end of this week. Fisco is also considering integrating the Zaif platform with its own exchange business.And Coincheck, now owned by the Monex Group after the biggest hack in exchange history, earlier this week confirmed it had resumed a full range of services for all of the cryptocurrencies it handles ‚Äì for the first time since January.The FSA, meanwhile, is likely to begin work on a new set of cryptocurrency regulations, and is currently holding exhaustive study group sessions with blockchain experts. Per the FSA, its study group has been looking at issues including ways to wipe out insider trading, shore up wallet service security ‚Äì and possibly rename ‚Äúcryptocurrencies‚Äù as ‚Äúencrypted asset‚Äù in legal documents.The financial sector is also pushing ahead with developments. The First Bank of Toyama, which  earlier this month announced it would launch a blockchain-powered stablecoin called FBC, has revealed details about the coin‚Äôs pilot.The bank hopes to commercialize its token in October 2019, and yesterday launched the pilot, which it says will run until April 23, 2019. The bank says it is running the pilot in conjunction with Intec, a Toyama-based IT firm. The coin will operate on the Japanese Bankers Association‚Äôs newly developed JBA Blockchain Collaboration Platform, and will allow FBC holders to pay in the stablecoin at restaurants and stores in the First Bank of Toyama‚Äôs headquarters."

","Even in the midst of depressed crypto prices and a stagnant market, one blockchain project is getting attention. Smart contract, decentralized exchange, and token development platform Waves has just seen a surge of interest from investors, despite the stagnation that the rest of the market appears to be stuck in.","It seems that the new wallet release was the trigger behind the current rally in Waves‚Äô price, propelling it from USD 1.46 to a high of USD 2.25 (+54%) on Tuesday, before falling back and trimming its gains to 38% (UTC 06:10 AM). In either case, it‚Äôs the best-performing coin in the top 50 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization.Waves price chart:The company has announced a range of positive news recently, including several new exchange listings, a full integration with the Ledger Nano S hardware wallet, and most recently the roll-out of its new Waves Mobile Wallet.We are excited to announce a long-awaited update of the #Waves Mobile app!

Read more about it here: https://t.co/5Qp7YKTa8r pic.twitter.com/y5hsCXj2GVThe Waves Mobile Wallet now includes a fully integrated decentralized exchange and allows for purchases of Waves tokens directly with credit cards from within the app, making the token much more accessible with fiat currencies than it has been in the past. So far, the app has more than 100,000 installs in Google‚Äôs Play store for Android devices. However, the price rally started several days before the news were announced, suggesting that there was a possible trading based on ‚Äútips‚Äù from insiders in the crypto market. As Cryptonews.com reported on previously, similar suspicions trading activity was also seen prior to the listing of Basic Attention Token (BAT) on Coinbase in late November.So far, the price rally has been sharp for Waves, which makes it unlikely that it will continue this way in the short-term. Long-term, however, there may be an opportunity for Waves to prove that it can truly match up with its better-known smart contracts competitors Ethereum, EOS, and 0x.Waves is a platform that was founded by the Russian entrepreneur Alexander Ivanov back in 2016, and has been operating out of its Moscow office ever since."

","‚ÄúThe promise of an open financial system, cross-border transactions for all, that was sparked by Bitcoin, is still as alive as ever,‚Äù Kavita Gupta, who runs a USD 50 million investment fund as Founding Managing Partner at ConsenSys Ventures, told Cryptonews.com. ","The company is an external investment arm of ConsenSys, a major blockchain software technology firm. It invests in pre-seed and seed stage Ethereum projects across the Web 3.0 stack.Over the years, Gupta has held several senior investment roles and in this exclusive interview she shares her thoughts on the evolution of cryptocurrencies, how the funding landscape is changing ‚Äî  and the importance of creating a healthy environment for women to flourish in the tech sector.Cryptonews.com: As the crypto landscape evolves what is your view on digital currencies?  Kavita Gupta: I think that the promise of an open financial system, cross-border transactions for all, that was sparked by Bitcoin, is still as alive as ever. Digital currencies and the promise of anyone being able to access their assets from anywhere in the world are as tantalizing today as it was in 2008, perhaps even more so. You can point to crises in Venezuela, Cuba, the friction of cross-border remittance or constant hacks (such as the one experienced by Equifax) as a proof of this. Now, do I think that tokenizing fiat in the way Circle, Coinbase, and Gemini have done recently is super revolutionary? (Here, Kavita Gupta is referencing to the stablecoins launched by the mentioned companies - Cryptonews.com) Not really. Although, I do think these will serve as a massive user experience upgrade to the decentralized web and these fiat backed tokens is definitely innovative for institutions. How is the venture capital (VC), funding landscape changing? I think VC investors are getting comfortable with this new paradigm of investing. Crypto investing looks a lot different: liquidity, duration, risk profile, volatility etc. are very different than the long-term traditional investment fund. The landscape is also changing for blockchain investors and the profile of entrepreneurs is changing. We see a shift from majority of young technologists serving as CEOs to a lot of  seasoned engineers and serial entrepreneurs entering the space. Product's vision, roadmap and especially the thought of adoption and user friendly interface have become a big part of the conversation. Some of the big VC's are setting up crypto dedicated funds bringing Web 2.0 and Web 3.0 worlds closer and validating lots of early tech in the space, which just a year ago would have looked fake. What type of projects have you recently invested in? Our two newest publicly announced investments are both incredibly exciting. The first, Unlock, is a protocol that allows content publishers to set up paywalls for their content without a middleman. It will eventually lead to people being able to micro-monetize their content, charge a few cents for an article or even a fraction of that for a tweet, etc. With only a few lines of code, anyone on the web can integrate Unlock's paywall-as-a-service, and they'll pivot into other areas of digital monetization, too.Another in Starkware, an innovative cryptography project out of Israel that's making major waves in the crypto industry. Without getting too technical, Starkware's Zero-Knowledge Proofs have drastically improved on the Snark technology (used by Zcash and others), allowing for private and highly scalable transactions. Once they reach full industrial grade, Starks will be a part of every blockchain, and can eventually even serve as the base layer for a new protocol.We started with the investment thesis of investing across the whole Ethereum stack, but the space is becoming very exciting for infrastructure, scalability and security products right now. What advice can you share with aspiring women in tech? What challenges have you faced as a female in tech?  Tech is like any other field in this world. It may look male dominated right now but doesn't mean we can't change it. As individuals, our first responsibility is to pursue what you really love and excel in it. Be strong and speak up if someone or something is making you uncomfortable.  Have a non defensive and honest conversation with your colleagues or seniors over coffee the first time you notice a pattern which makes you uncomfortable. If that doesn't solve the problem then speak up in [public] if the pattern continues. Find other women in the space and create a safe environment to have a support system and open conversation. The more you support each other and stand up - the more you would contribute in creating a healthy space for more women to follow. I have been blessed with some of the most supporting mentors and bosses in my life, but irrespective, I have never stayed quiet if I saw a pattern of rejection based on sex or color. I did question myself on my abilities at first, but having a confidence in my work and support system at work has always helped me to see through situations and gave me confidence to stand up as needed."

","One of South Korea‚Äôs largest banks, Shinhan has claimed it has started adopting blockchain technology ‚Äúin earnest,‚Äù claiming that it has already provided some 400 employees with blockchain ‚Äúeducation and consulting‚Äù and is already beginning to commercialize blockchain-powered services.","The bank claims that it began blockchain-powered Interest Rate Swap (IRS) transactions late last month ‚Äì the first commercial service to be developed by the bank‚Äôs Blockchain Lab unit. The unit has also conducted talks with government and regulatory bodies with a view to potentially expanding its commercial blockchain operations into the foreign exchange and investment sectors.Shinhan is thought to be keen on exploring the potential uses of both blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies.Per media outlet Money Today, the bank has also struck a deal with Korbit, one of the country‚Äôs biggest cryptocurrency exchanges, which will allow new Korbit account holders to use real-name banking services for Korean won withdrawals. The bank had previously only allowed existing Korbit account holders to use such services. The government earlier this year issued guidelines that require banks in the country to only allow withdrawals to be made via real-name and social security number-verified accounts.Shinhan is also working on blockchain technology projects with KT, the South Korean telecom provider that claims it has developed one of the world‚Äôs fastest blockchain platforms. The bank  has previously expressed an interest in developing a network of ultra-safe cryptocurrency vaults, and struck deals with the likes of Ripple. Its credit card arm has agreed a deal with OmiseGo, an Ethereum-powered payment platform.Shinhan's global network:Elsewhere, market-leading exchange Bithumb has released a Beta version of a voting platform that will allow its users to vote on which cryptocurrencies it should list. The exchange says it will monitor the platform ‚Äú24 hours a day to ensure fair voting,‚Äù will bar fraudulent tokens and will review all nominated coins to ensure they are above-board.Meanwhile, a South Korean blockchain startup is attempting to reverse the country‚Äôs blanket ban on all forms of initial coin offering (ICO) by appealing to the constitutional court, reports Segye Ilbo. The company, named Presto, is attempting to conduct a decentralized autonomous initial coin offering (DAICO), and hopes to convince the court of the ICO ban's nonfeasance.The government is yet to announce if it has changed its stance on the ICO ban following extensive pressure from business groups ‚Äì despite promising it would do so by the end of November."

","Plague Hunters, the blockchain-based video game, has reportedly been approved by Japanese tech giant Sony and it‚Äôs coming to the PlayStation 4, a video game console, soon. This is the first Ethereum blockchain-based game that has gone through Sony‚Äôs rigid process of approval.","Plague Hunters, the sequel to its forefather, the successful Plague Road, is developed by Arcade Distillery, a New York-based video game maker. Arcade Distillery is expected to release the game in Q1 2019.The game teaser:The game will use the freemium model, so it will be free to play with a chance for players to purchase in-game items. For this, Plague Hunters will have a built-in peer-to-peer (P2P) marketplace powered by the Ethereum blockchain. Players can use the marketplace to exchange their items with each other with having full ownership of the assets. The in-game assets will be non-fungible tokens, which you may know from CryptoKitties.Despite that the marketplace will be built on the Ethereum blockchain, Plague Hunter will not feature blockchain-based gameplay. Instead, the gameplay was designed for the PS4 and Nintendo Switch, a gaming console, with Arcade Distillery exploring options to release the game for Xbox One and smartphones.While the gameplay will be very similar to non-blockchain based games, users in Plague Hunter‚Äôs ecosystem will have full ownership of every asset they receive, collect, or buy, as well as the scarcity of the in-game items will have provable scarcity. Basing a video game on the blockchain is a creative way to introduce new people to cryptocurrencies as well as to attract crypto enthusiasts into blockchain gaming. But Plague Hunter is not the only blockchain-based game that‚Äôs to be released. Earlier in November, the Coinbase-backed card game Gods Unchained released its gameplay trailer. The game - which was inspired by popular titles like Magic: the Gathering and Hearthstone - will also feature blockchain-based assets, but the gameplay will happen on the creator's, Fuel Games‚Äô servers.Gods Unchained is soon going into private beta for stress testing the game, and in three months, the game‚Äôs open beta will be released with the full launch coming thereafter."

","Christmas is drawing ever nearer, and figuring out what to buy as a present is never an easy task. Buying something crypto-related for your enthusiast friend - or yourself - is an obvious choice, but what to choose? Where to find it? Cryptonews.com assembled a list of great Christmas gift ideas to help you pick.","(Found this article in 2019? Checkout our new list of crypto gifts for 2019.)
______Well, it's not a very original idea, but is definitely worth to remember. A hardware wallet is a special type of cryptocurrency wallet which stores the user's private keys in a hardware device. Hardware wallets promise enhanced security against software wallets in the case of theft or scams. If you hold cryptocurrencies, it is only logical that you would want to protect them and keep them safe until you want to spend them, or HODL until the next bull run.There are three wallets that are among the most popular ones:__A Faraday bag shields all electronic devices (like tablets, phones, HD Wallets, thumb drives, smart watches and keyfobs) from all radio frequency signals (BT, WIFI, RFID, GPS, Keyfob) and protects your electronics from EMP blasts from the likes of solar flares or malicious attacks.
You can use one to keep your phone, tablet, hardware wallet or anything similar safe in it. Their price range can be anything between USD 20 and USD 100, depending on what you need and what size it is. It‚Äôs definitely something you rarely hear about!
__The Casa node is a fool proof plug-n-play Bitcoin full node and Lightning node, combined. Simply plug it in, sync up the blockchain and you should be ready to make lightning payments in no time! They are plug and play, pre-synced, and easy to set up and use. Make and receive Lightning payments, no coding required.Although it is a bit pricey - around USD 300 - it is a great gift for anyone who wants to experiment with Bitcoin transactions. You can find the Casa node review here.__This is about as tech a gift you can get for someone at the holidays, but it doesn't need to be so scary even for those who don't have  strong technical know-how. For example, in November, Coinmine, a Coinbase, among other investors, backed crypto tech startup, introduced Coinmine One, a USD 799 device capable of mining cryptocurrencies. However, the company stressed ‚Äúthis is not just a miner, but a general purpose crypto device that just happens to include a GPU [graphics processing unit] miner‚Äù and ‚Äúwhat you buy today will not be what you have in the future.‚Äù In either case, mining cryptocurrencies with this device is not profitable business in the current market. Hopefully, next Christmas this good looking crypto box will bring more value to its owners. __Regardless of whether it‚Äôs by HTC, or Sirin Labs, a blockchain phone can act as a cold storage wallet, with increased security and specific features based on blockchain technology. As a gift to a crypto and blockchain aficionado, it‚Äôs probably perfect - from storing their crypto on it, over following prices on integrated dapps, to paying with crypto through your phone, these gadgets seem as good as it gets.Still, be prepared to cash out around USD 1,000 regardless of which of these phones you choose - Exodus or Finney - and also be prepared for your present to be late for Christmas, as most of them are expected to be delivered around New Year or later. Next year, Pundi X's XPhone might joint the gift list, also, as the company aims to start shipping it in Q2 of 2019.__For those with a sense of humor and without much money to spare, a blockchain keychain could be the perfect gift. Not only does it take blockchain completely literally, it‚Äôs also a great conversation piece - all your friends will be so impressed once you start explaining what blocks and hashes are and how SHA256 works.The keychain costs USD 12 and is available on Etsy (last time we checked.) __Crypto-related art can bring a decentralized air into any room - if that‚Äôs what you want. So if you‚Äôd like to show your cypherpunk colors (or any others), why not gift someone a painting? You both get to show off, it‚Äôs another conversation piece, and people visiting immediately know what the main topic of conversation will be.For example, this picture starts at around USD 44 and its price increases with the dimensions you want. It‚Äôs available on Etsy.__Sometimes, your friend has a long day and just needs to kick back and relax. Whether with Glenfiddich or apple juice doesn‚Äôt matter, but this decanter with two glasses can help him remember to check the prices of crypto. And maybe pour himself another one. You can find the set on Amazon for USD 68. 
__Do you have a friend that would actually like crypto if they knew more about it? Gift them a cryptocurrency course! You will have someone to share your pain when checking prices in no time. From the basics to investing in initial coin offerings (ICOs), you can learn anything online for a small price.Starting at around USD 10 on Udemy and going up to around USD 100 each on edX, these courses can be the starting point your friend needs to join the cryptoverse.__Let‚Äôs be real, is it truly Christmas without an ugly Christmas sweater? Our personal favorite is this one, which says ‚ÄúHo Ho HODL‚Äù - a sentiment many wholeheartedly agree with. It‚Äôs available on Etsy for around USD 30, with a choice of color and a few equally interesting ones related to crypto from the same seller.__Is someone you know having a baby? Are you having one? Even if you just want to buy it for yourself and keep it for any potential offspring, this onesie is a great choice for a humblebrag. It‚Äôs also a conversation starter - for example, all your relatives are going to ask ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs crypto?‚Äù as soon as they see it. Available on Zazzle for around USD 14.__Is your friend a little bit too obsessed with the safety of their crypto? Give them another layer of protection with a Bitcoin vault. Best used for storing your paper wallet - or any other valuable paper - it features a 5 letter combination lock, where you must spell the correct secret word or combination to open the chamber. Available on Amazon for USD 52 plus shipping.__If you have a friend or family member that‚Äôs in it for the technology, getting them something to constantly remind them of this is probably a good idea. You can either design and print your own (DIY presents are great!) or order one online. There is one available at BTCPoster.com for USD 79.__These pens, announced in April this year, are what every classy person needs and the perfect gift if you have a lot of money to spare. And we do mean a lot. The absolute least you will pay for one is EUR 1,250, which comes to around USD 1,420. At least they offer free shipping. Can be found on the official Ancora1919 website.__If the price of the pen left you gasping for air, maybe a mug of coffee will help. This one changes color when hot liquid is poured in to an image of the Bitcoin genesis block. It‚Äôs available on BitcoinShirt.co for USD 17.90, but can also be paid for in Bitcoin.__Getting your own tiny little kitty on the blockchain would be pretty cool, wouldn‚Äôt it? If you have some Ether, you can buy a CryptoKitty in the Marketplace, with a wide range of prices. Once you have it, you also get the option to gift it to someone! CryptoKitties can also probably help you figure out how genetics works, so you can always consider it a learning prop if you need to explain yourself to anyone.__Does your friend already own a CryptoKitty? Do they already have a favorite? Turn that kitten into a physical representation as a personalized gift! Available at this Etsy store, you can send this person the picture of the kitty you want and get a needle felted cat for USD 28.__While we‚Äôre still on the topic of cats, there‚Äôs a Japanese-style figurine called the maneki-neko (translating to ‚Äúbeckoning cat‚Äù) - a talisman of a cat with one raised paw which is often believed to bring good luck to the owner. When shopping in the volatile crypto market, good luck is exactly what you need, as well as a way to save up some money. That‚Äôs why you can buy a crypto cat that doubles as a bank for you to keep fiat in it. Available on Etsy for USD 19.__Another not very original idea, but need we say anything more? After all, isn‚Äôt this what most crypto fans want? Since the market is plummeting and a Lambo never seemed farther away, buying one for your loved ones would be a good deed. But then again, if you can afford to fork out over USD 200,000 for the cheapest version available, won‚Äôt you buy one for us too?
___Perhaps the most obvious answer of all, a great present for anyone in crypto would be - more crypto. Simply sending them any amount of cryptocurrency (as usual, you need to do your own research which coin to choose) takes care of the present and is a great choice for anyone, veterans and newbies alike. This is like the old-fashioned cash gift, except we‚Äôre moving to crypto now. Best part? You can spend as much as you choose to. Also, paper wallets like this might help here.__"

","Another massive campaign targeting Ethereum mining rigs has been going on for at least a week, since December 3rd, ZDNet reported, citing Troy Mursch, co-founder of Bad Packets LLC, a cybersecurity company. Attackers are scanning for devices with port 8545 exposed online - which has cost careless miners more than USD 20 million back in June this year, when the same thing happened.","The port 8545 is standard for the JSON-RPC interface of many Ethereum wallets and mining equipment. Some Ethereum software applications can be configured to expose a Remote Procedure Call (RPC), the purpose of which is to provide access to programmatic API (application programming interface) that an approved third-party service or app can query and interact or retrieve data from the original Ethereum-based service. The RPC interface can also grant access to very sensitive functions, like private keys, personal details and similar.In theory, the interface should be only exposed locally, but some wallet apps and mining equipment enable it on all interfaces. Furthermore, this JSON-RPC interface, when enabled, also does not come with a password in default configurations and relies on users setting one. If this stays exposed on the internet, attackers can freely move funds from the victim‚Äôs address to their own.here as well, 1st wave seen around 4pm UTC pic.twitter.com/i5dXEohYI0Many mining rig vendors and wallet app makers have taken precautions to limit port 8545 exposure, or have removed the JSON-RPC interface altogether. The Ethereum team sent out a security advisory to all Ethereum users about the dangers of using mining equipment and Ethereum software that exposes this API interface over the Internet, recommending that users take precautions by either adding a password on the interface, or using a firewall to filter incoming traffic for port 8545.To showcase the vulnerability of many miners, ZDNet writes that, ‚ÄúA quick Shodan [search engine for Internet-connected devices] search shows that nearly 4,700 devices --most of which are Geth mining equipment and Parity wallets-- are currently exposing their 8545 port.‚Äù Even though the price of the asset is reaching new lows, standing at around USD 90 as of the time of writing, this has not deterred attackers from looking for easy pickings. As previously reported, protecting yourself from these attacks does not have to be very difficult. Tinkering with your Ethereum client should be off-limits unless you‚Äôre certain you know what you‚Äôre doing, and reading the warning notices that come with the app you‚Äôre using should be your first step. Of course, if you have a good reason to enable the RPC interface, secure it by an access control list (ACL), a firewall, or other authentication systems."

","Media reports about Bahamas-based Deltec Bank accepting suspicious transactions is part of an ‚Äúorganized campaign‚Äù against their customer Tether, Leonardo Real, Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) at Tether, the most popular stablecoin, told Cryptonews.com, without specifying who's behind this campaign. ","According to him, this is all ‚Äúmisinformation‚Äù designed to hurt Tether itself, after they unveiled their account with the bank, claiming that they can back their USDT coins one on one thanks to those holdings.Cryptonews.com talked to the CCO about these and many other issues that the stablecoin has run into and how that affected their business.Cryptonews.com: According to Bloomberg, while federal prosecutors opened a broad criminal probe into cryptocurrencies months ago, they‚Äôve recently homed in on suspicions that a tangled web involving bitcoin, Tether and crypto exchange Bitfinex might have been used to illegally move prices. What‚Äôs your comment on this?Leonardo Real: We stand by the fact that all outstanding USDT are backed 1-to-1 by fiat USD. This has been confirmed on numerous occasions, by unrelated parties and at unconnected points in time. The story put forth by Bloomberg cites an unbacked, independent study which claims that, if USDT were to be unbacked (i.e. supply-driven and ‚Äúpushed"" onto traders as opposed to ‚Äúpulled‚Äù via organic demand) it could indicate manipulation of the Bitcoin price. The entire study relies on the assumption that USDT is unbacked and therefore not sufficiently driven by trader demand. This is flawed, and claims which suggest that USDT transactions aren‚Äôt driven by demand when it is consistently in the top 2 of traded cryptocurrencies in the space with regards to volume, are simply ridiculous by now. To reiterate, the accusation against Tether is based around the assumption that outstanding USDTs are unbacked - something which has been proven false time and time again. The story is a clear example of technological innovation moving too quick for mainstream journalists to learn, understand and analyze developments in a certain space.The Deltec bank account case was the latest in a string of those where people don‚Äôt believe you that you hold the assets to back your stablecoin. What‚Äôs your next step? How will you prove to your customers that their trust in you is not misplaced? Will you finally say yes to an official audit?We have clearly demonstrated to all parties that we have the funds we say we have at various points. We released the consulting report from Friedman LLP [a New York City-based accounting, tax and business consulting] firm last year. We had Freeh Sporkin & Sullivan [a Washington-based law firm] investigate our balances in June 2018. We published a letter from Deltec bank this month. The only people who don't believe that we have the funds are people that refuse to acknowledge the facts, presumably for their own reasons. We have never said no to an audit or refused to engage in this process, but the accounting industry continues to grapple with and have difficulty providing assurance services in the cryptocurrency space. As and when they are ready to help, we hope to be able to engage with them.According to media reports, your bank, Deltec, is suspected to be accepting suspicious transactions, such as laundered funds, as well as being named in two global bribery cases. What‚Äôs your comment on this? How does this affect your business with them? Will this cast a shadow on your own trustworthiness?This is more misinformation that is now targeting our bankers as part of an organized campaign against us. We are proud to be working with Deltec. Their compliance and operational standards are second to none. Their compliance functions have not been compromised and they are not involved in any case that could cast doubt on their integrity. Deltec has done nothing wrong in any of the allegations made against it of which we are aware.How does the community‚Äôs skepticism affect you? Have you noticed drops in your transaction volumes?Not at all. In fact, we continue to be a leader in transaction volume. We are proud to offer a service that focuses on our customers' needs, and we believe that this focus has been a key to our success.What caused the steep price drop of USDT on October 15?We do not comment on the price of USDT on other platforms. Tether continues to maintain a 1:1 peg. USDTs are always valued at USD 1.The community is currently outraged about the fact that you, as well as some other stablecoins, retain the right to refuse service to whoever you want to, calling it centralized and against cryptocurrency politics. What‚Äôs your comment on this? Is this a necessary tradeoff in the case of stablecoins? Are there ways to keep both users and regulators happy?We must maintain the right to refuse service to bad actors and those who are in breach of our terms of service. This is a legal requirement, but even if it were not, we would want to do it to prevent our platform from being exploited by those trying to harm others.Do the recent troubles Bitfinex has been having (fiat withdrawals especially) affect Tether in any way? How is Bitfinex‚Äôs fiat withdrawal fee increase affecting Tether? Is the lack of trust in Bitfinex translating to Tether, and vice versa? What about Bitfinex insolvency rumors? Demand for Tether remains steady and strong. It is the dominant stablecoin in the space because it is useful to people transacting business among exchanges.There have been several social media cleanses, most notably one where every post in the r/Tether subreddit (on popular social network Reddit) has been deleted. Why? Spam? Bots? Something else?We have set our subreddit spam filters to high on both /r/Bitfinex and /r/Tether to control a coordinated wave of unsubstantiated, ill-researched and, at times dangerous claims (e.g. leaking of private employee information), which made their way to our subreddits. It is publicly verifiable that we actively address all support inquiries, issues, concerns and complaints across the Bitfinex subreddit and that we have never taken the steps to conceal any potential customer concerns. Our community managers and support agents are active across both Reddit and Telegram should users or industry followers wish to discuss certain industry developments taking place.Are other stablecoins competing with Tether? Do you see your stablecoin being overtaken by new ones as the biggest stablecoin? Who do you see as your biggest competitor currently?There are a number of stablecoin alternatives, and all try to offer something in the space. Tether's main competitor may have not yet emerged."

","Second only to DEX, which has soared in price in recent days, the TenX PAY token stands out as a shining star in an otherwise red crypto market this week as the Singapore-based crypto payment company is estimated to finally deliver on their promises.","PAY was up by 18% on Wednesday morning before trimming its gains to 10% (UTC 07:10 AM) and is still up by more than 8% in a week. However, it is down by 95% from its all-time high a year ago.PAY price chart: So, what exactly is it that has been driving the recent bullishness in this token? The answer may be found in the company‚Äôs 2018 OKR (Objectives and Key Results) Update published on December 11. Judging from this, the company may be set to start rolling out their much-anticipated payment cards right around Christmas this year, with KYC (know your customer) checks for the first batch of customers starting today, December 12.

In that sense we‚Äôre big supporters of Ripple or anything else‚Ä¶ and if any of these gets enough adoption, and it actually materially helps us do things cheaper and faster, we‚Äôd love to, but so far we haven‚Äôt found one.‚ÄùTransferWise claims it has more than 4 million customers and is moving ""over GBP 3 billion every month globally, saving people GBP 80 million in hidden charges."" It is available in 71 countries covering over 1,300 currency routes.Ripple, meanwhile, keeps adding victories to their books. From signing up three new companies - Mercury FX, Cuallix, and Catalyst Corporate Federal Credit Union - over remittance operator TransferGo implementing Ripple‚Äôs xCurrent product for cross-border payments (which is not using XRP), to its XRP coin taking second place by market cap and staying there, the company is seeing wider adoption than many other blockchain-based solutions. TransferWise, meanwhile, thinks it prudent to wait until Ripple is even more widely adopted, to make blockchain more efficient than the prevailing payments systems in banks.TransferWise is not the only company that remains unconvinced. Back in June this year, Western Union, an American money transfer giant, said they had not seen a benefit from Ripple‚Äôs technology during a six-month trial period. The company‚Äôs CEO, Hikmet Ersek, told Fortune, ‚ÄúWe are always criticized that Western Union is not cost-efficient, blah blah blah, but we did not see that part of the efficiency yet during our tests. The practical matter is it‚Äôs still too expensive.‚ÄùMeanwhile, TransferGo claims it has 700,000 customers across 47 destinations worldwide and completes 1.5 million transactions per year and has implemented xCurrent for their cross-border payments. Back in October, the CEO, Daumantas Dvilinskas, said he had his sights on growing the company‚Äôs customer base from one million to one hundred million and for this, he says that TransferGo‚Äôs partnership with Ripple will be key."

","Switzerland-based Sirin Labs was the fourth largest initial coin offering (ICO) of 2017, having raised USD 157.8 million, and they‚Äôre finally delivering their product in the shape of a blockchain phone named Finney. ","Many ICOs from last year flopped, and the top five ones saw their token price tumbling. However, it now looks like Sirin might be back in the race, as their coin (SRN) is up by around 18% in the past 24 hours (UTC 7:00 PM) - and the phone has been launched at an event in Barcelona today.SRN price chart:Finney is a smartphone, named after Hal Finney, the second ever user of Bitcoin (after Satoshi Nakamoto,) with an operating system (OS) based on blockchain, called SIRIN OS. It features a cold storage wallet, a special operating system and an additional screen called the Safe Screen, as well as increased security. Technological specifications of the phone have been published at the beginning of this month, and the phone does not lack any other, more common specifications either, boasting:The phone was initially announced in September 2017, and the company signed on football superstar Lionel Messi as its brand ambassador in December 2017, followed by raising USD 157.8 million in the fourth largest ICO of the year. More news followed in April this year, when FIH Mobile, a subsidiary of electronics company Foxconn, was chosen to manufacture it. Notably, FIH are also makers of the iPhone phone, Xbox video game console and Kindle e-reader.Its two main competitors are the HTC Exodus (available for pre-order) and Pundi X XPhone (to be launched in Q2 of 2019). Although they share many of the same basic specifications, Exodus does have a better main camera at 16 MPX. The XPhone, which has it's own blockchain-based operating system, does not have any of its attributes currently listed other than 64 GB of internal storage and 6 GB RAM, which they say is the ‚Äúminimum specs requirement.‚Äù However, the phone‚Äôs website adds that, ‚ÄúThis is a working prototype hence the final product will be different.‚ÄùAs for differences in the way they work, all three use operating systems based on Android in some way or other, with the main difference being that Exodus runs Android and another, micro operating system running parallel with it for added security. All three should be able to run dapps (decentralized applications), as well as offer dapp marketplaces, and should be able to double as cold storage wallets. Finney differs from its competitors by offering a Safe Screen, which they consider its strongest feature. It operates as the gateway to the crypto world by activating the cold storage wallet, and it has a separate power switch for users to access it relatively independently. The phone also offers its Token Conversion Service (TCS) which enables users to make crypto transactions for supported coins and tokens (at launch - BTC, ETH, and SRN.)Finney can currently be pre-ordered through Sirin Labs website and paid for with SRN tokens with a discount of 10%, and should be available through the Amazon Launchpad program from January. Its price stands at USD 999. Later on, the phone is set to be available for purchase through additional channels of payments, including credit card. The company will also open two flagship concept stores first in London in December 2018, and later in Tokyo in January 2019, where the phone will be physically sold. The store on London is also set to become a ‚Äúblockchain academy for our community and any blockchain-curious audience.‚Äù

","Although trading of four new coins has yet to be enabled on Coinbase Pro (UTC 09:15 AM), the price of the four tokens could be seen surging on other exchanges over the weekend.","On Friday, Coinbase announced that it is adding four new assets to its more advanced trading platform known as Coinbase Pro. These assets are the four Ethereum-based (ERC20) tokens Civic (CVC), district0x (DNT), Loom Network (LOOM), and Decentraland (MANA).The company said that inbound transfers of all four of these assets are now enabled, although trading in them will not be available for at least another two days. As of press time, trading in the new assets is still not activated on the platform.Since Friday, District0x is up more than 50% in US dollar terms on Binance exchange, while Decentraland on its end added close to 30% from its bottom on Friday.Meanwhile, Loom Network also added close to 30% from a bottom of roughly USD 0.036 on Binance on Friday, to USD 0.048 as of press time. Civic also surged by more than 40% on Friday, but later fell back to end the day roughly 20% higher than its lowest point that day.Civic price chart:_____

Loom Network price chart:__________The weekend gains this time differs from the Zcash listing back in November, when nearly all gains were achieved even before the listing was announced, leading the community to suspect widespread insider trading.Friday‚Äôs announcement was also accompanied by news that Coinbase considers listing another 27 digital assets in the unspecified future, a reminder that the company intents to list nearly all ERC20 tokens that comply with its published Digital Asset Framework.  Now, Coinbase is evaluating these assets:
Cardano (ADA), Aeternity (AE), Aragon (ANT), Bread Wallet (BRD),  Dai (DAI), EnjinCoin (ENJ), EOS (EOS), Golem Network (GNT), IOST (IOST), Kin (KIN), Kyber Network (KNC), ChainLink (LINK), Loopring (LRC), Mainframe (MFT), Maker (MKR), NEO (NEO), OmiseGo (OMG), Po.et (POE), QuarkChain (QKC), Augur (REP), Request Network (REQ), Status (SNT), Storj (STORJ), Stellar (XLM), XRP (XRP), Tezos (XTZ), and Zilliqa (ZIL).However, the company does not guarantee that all assets they are evaluating will ultimately be listed for trading, as ‚Äúadding new assets requires significant exploratory work from both a technical and compliance standpoint.‚Äù ‚ÄúFurthermore, our listing process may result in some of these assets being listed solely for customers to buy and sell, without the ability to send or receive using a local wallet,‚Äù according to Coinbase.Among other strong movers in the top 100 of the crypto market over the weekend were DEX, the token developed by the Korean crypto exchange Coinbit as rewards in its ‚Äútransaction mining‚Äù process. Despite DEX currently being ranked as number 70 in terms of market capitalization, there is an extremely thin market for the token, with nearly all trading taking place on Coinbit. The price is therefore behaving in an very volatile manner, gaining over 30% in the last 24 hours."

","Coinbase, Bitstamp, Bithumb, Poloniex. These crypto-exchanges have all been subject to big investments in recent months, as traditional VC (venture capital) and investment firms have either pumped money into them, purchased controlling stakes, or bought them outright.","And while there's an argument to be made that the entry of big money might influence the cryptocurrency industry to develop in a way that favors big business more than the individual HODLer, most experts working within crypto believe that the recent influx of corporate money is a positive ‚Äì and necessary ‚Äì development for the industry.Speaking to Cryptonews.com, BitPay CEO Stephen Pair affirms that major investment in crypto is something of an inevitability, one that startups, cryptocurrencies and crypto-exchanges ignore at their peril.""Any company in a space that is attractive to VC investment must consider taking that investment to continue or accelerate their growth,"" he says. ""Otherwise, they risk falling behind their competitors.""Indeed, competition is a big reason why Coinbase accepted a new round of funding worth USD 300 million in October, after the likes of Tiger Global Management and Andreessen Horowitz increased its valuation to a whopping USD 8 million.Because Coinbase has been so successful in attracting traditional investment and expanding its global operations, other crypto-exchanges have been compelled to do the same, since their profits alone haven't always been enough to drive growth at this stage in the crypto industry's development.This would largely account for Bitmain's (a manufacturer of crypto mining hardware) planned flotation, from which it's set to receive a hefty injection of stock-market cash. It published its prospectus at the end of September, revealing that it had in fact made a USD 400 million loss in Q2 2018.This loss and the decline in revenues accompanying it suggests that crypto is at a point of development where big investment is needed. Mining competition is increasing and profits are being squeezed, so Bitmain appears to be seeking large-scale investment as a way of driving out its competitors and moving into the kind of √ºber-dominant position that would give them more power over prices.Yet tightening competition isn't the only reason why crypto-focused businesses are turning to VC and big investment, blockchain analyst Tone Vays tells Cryptonews.com.""I think the main reason exchanges like Poloniex and now Bitstamp took the buy-outs is to allow a bigger company with resources to get over the regulatory hurdle and keep them in business,"" he says. ""We recently saw the US Government shut down 1Broker.com for trading illegal swaps while the exchange has never been hacked nor defrauded a single user.""More generally, other experts point out that the appearance of big investment is necessary if crypto wants to become mainstream.""Any time you get a new industry, like the internet, or crypto, the first investors generally have a focus on the new technology,"" Lou Kerner ‚Äì a partner at CryptoOracle, an advisory and investment firm, ‚Äì explains to Cryptonews.com. ""But over time, as the new technology matures, as more investors understand the potential for disruption and wealth creation, more traditional investors start investing.""""So traditional financial sources investing in crypto, and crypto exchanges, is just signs 
of a maturing industry.""In other words, the appearance of big investors is a seal of approval for crypto, a recognition that it has the potential to be a disruptive force in a future economy.However, could it just be a sign that it has the potential to make rich people even richer, and could the appearance of big money somehow end up disadvantaging the individual HODLer? ‚ÄúNo, I don‚Äôt believe this is something we need to be concerned about,‚Äù Gabriele Giancola ‚Äì the CEO/co-founder of the Swiss-based loyalty platform qiibee ‚Äì tells Cryptonews.com. ‚ÄúIf anything, this is an opportunity for HODLers and traditional investors to work together within the cryptosphere to achieve mainstream adoption.‚ÄùUtopia Music‚Äôs Brent Jaciow largely agrees, explaining to us that ‚Äúmost consensus algorithms (and all permissioned DLTs) still set out to reward single contributors regardless of their investment size,‚Äù meaning that smaller players will still continue to play a significant role in crypto.‚ÄúIn order to allow crypto markets to mature, inclusion of institutional investors is necessary,‚Äù he concludes. ‚ÄúYes, there is the risk that their influence could become large, but this is far outweighed by the benefits of further legitimising the asset class, bringing investment capital to the space, and creating more liquid and efficient crypto markets.‚Äù"
