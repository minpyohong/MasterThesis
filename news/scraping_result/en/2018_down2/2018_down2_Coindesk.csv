Since bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization by a considerable margin, now comprising 53.5 percent of the total market, all other cryptocurrencies tend to follow its lead when it comes to price performance. As a result, the broader market suffered substantial losses in November, with just one of the world’s largest 25 cryptocurrencies able to post a monthly gain. The outlier was bitcoin SV, a fork off of the original bitcoin cash blockchain, yet it has only existed long enough to accrue 22 days of pricing data on CoinMarketCap. if(""undefined""==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper[""SXOv6""]={},window.datawrapper[""SXOv6""].embedDeltas={""100"":625,""200"":575,""300"":525,""400"":500,""500"":500,""700"":500,""800"":475,""900"":475,""1000"":475},window.datawrapper[""SXOv6""].iframe=document.getElementById(""datawrapper-chart-SXOv6""),window.datawrapper[""SXOv6""].iframe.style.height=window.datawrapper[""SXOv6""].embedDeltas[Math.min(1e3,Math.max(100*Math.floor(window.datawrapper[""SXOv6""].iframe.offsetWidth/100),100))]+""px"",window.addEventListener(""message"",function(a){if(""undefined""!=typeof a.data[""datawrapper-height""])for(var b in a.data[""datawrapper-height""])if(""SXOv6""==b)window.datawrapper[""SXOv6""].iframe.style.height=a.data[""datawrapper-height""][b]+""px""});Double-digits losses were common among the world’s largest cryptocurrencies in November.

can't be ignored especially when considering its notorious â€œboom and ...","Dec 7, 2018 at 05:00 UTC","When trying to predict the future price of bitcoin, it’s impossible to do so without first looking at its past. ","No matter how it’s examined, the cyclical nature of bitcoin’s price action can’t be ignored especially when considering its notorious “boom and bust” cycles.If the latest plunge below the long-lasting support level of $6,000 after an explosive rise to nearly $20,000 is any indication, it’s clear the history repeating trend has yet to cease. This line of thought is potentially revealing since the breakdown of several bitcoin bubbles have followed an “opposite but equal” theme. In other words, bitcoin’s price tends to consolidate in a specific pattern when in a bubble state, which eventually breaks down in the opposite direction to a near-identical distance as the height of the pattern.  Using this logic, a bottom for the current bear market can be extrapolated, as explored below.A symmetrical triangle in technical analysis consists of two simultaneously converging trendlines, and is generally a continuation pattern in nature. Like many patterns, a rough estimate for a triangle breakout or breakdown target can be predicted. Generally, the pattern height is either added or subtracted from the breakout/down point to create a target, but with BTC, using the top-to-bottom distance of the base range (percentage) seems to be a more accurate unit of measurement.A large triangle formed in June-July of 2016 with a 30 percent base range (left frame). Using the ‘opposite but equal’ breakdown/out logic from before, the price should bottom out 30 percent lower than the breakdown point. As the left frame shows, the 30 percent drop was achieved almost exactly, to the tune of -29.5 percent.The same measure rule came into play the following year when price formed another symmetrical triangle pattern. This example has the base range of 28 percent which, using the same measuring logic as before, provided the perfect bottom 28 percent below the breakdown point.The bearish member of the triangle family is the descending triangle, which consists of a flat bottom and ‘descending’ top. This pattern, too, abides by the ‘opposite but equal’ breakdown rule. Take the bear market of 2011 for example in the upper frame. Although the price action is not as clean – likely due to BTC being relatively illiquid on Bitstamp at the time – it’s clear that a descending triangle was the backbone of the market structure with a clear base at $5.43. Once again, using the measuring logic from before, price should have fallen 26 percent below its breakdown point based off of its base range. As can be seen, BTC eventually did bottom out at a price level nearly 24 percent below the point. The 2014 bear market is, in a sense, a larger scale of the 2011 bear market pattern. As seen in the bottom frame of the above chart, the base range of this triangle is 65 percent. Perhaps unsurprisingly, when subtracted to the bottom of the triangle, another very similar ‘opposite but equal’ 62 percent drop marked the bottom of this market downturn. Now, looking at the current 2018 bear market, history has already told us there is a high likelihood the price of bitcoin will breakdown from this triangle to a similar distance as its base range, With that logic in mind, there are two possible targets for the current bear market bottom that can be created.Since the base range of this descending triangle is 54 percent, a subtraction from the breakdown point of the triangle provides a target of $2,676. Usually, this would be the ideal spot for the market to bottom (give or take a few percentage points) but since the price history above $13,000 does not fit in the triangle, a secondary target should be created due to the nature of bitcoin breaking down to an opposite but equal distance as its run up. The range from bitcoin’s all-time high of $19,666 to the breakdown point is 70 percent, so when when subtracted from the breakdown point, the target of $1,725 is created. In conclusion, bitcoin’s price tends to follow an ‘opposite but equal’ rule when recording a triangle pattern breakdown.Using that logic, an ideal bottom zone for the cryptocurrency’s most recent bear market is between $2,676 and $1,725 – give or take a few percentage points in either direction.Disclosure: The author holds BTC, AST, REQ, OMG, FUEL, 1st and AMP at the time of writing.Crash test dummy image via Shutterstock"

Further, the year-on-year loss now stands at 32 percent, as prices were trading well above $7,600 on Nov. 19, 2017.Elsewhere, ethereum’s ETH token, cardano and Tron are also flashing double-digit losses on a 24- hour basis. Notably, ETH fell to $155 earlier today, the lowest level since July 16, 2017, as per CoinMarketCap. Meanwhile, XRP, the second-largest cryptocurrency as per market capitalization, is reporting a 6.5 percent drop. Only nine out of top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization are trading in the green and three out of the nine are stablecoins pegged to fiat currencies.The sharp losses in the major cryptocurrencies have pushed the total market capitalization down to a 13-month low of $172 billion. In the last five days, the total value has dropped by more than $30 billion.The risk aversion could worsen in the near-term, as bitcoin is looking increasingly weak on the technical charts.As seen above, BTC closed last week (UTC) at $5,560, confirming a downside break of the nine-month-long descending channel – a bearish continuation pattern.The cryptocurrency also closed below the 100-week exponential moving average (EMA), which had been acting as support since June. More importantly, both 50- and 100-week EMAs have shed bullish bias.The 14-week relative strength index (RSI) of 37.00 is signaling scope for a deeper sell-off.Therefore, BTC risks falling below the psychological support $5,000 in the near term. Major support below that level is seen around $4,100 (trendline connecting the January 2015 and April 2017 lows.)Over on the daily chart, the RSI of 15 is indicating that the sell-off is overdone. Hence, a sustained break below the psychological support of $5,000 looks unlikely in the short-term.The RSI on the 4-hour chart is creating a higher low, despite the lower low on the price chart, marking the development of a bullish divergence. The divergence would be confirmed if the RSI continues to post higher lows and the 4-hour candle closes in the green. That would open the doors to a corrective rally.Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.Bitcoin chart image via Shutterstock; Charts by Trading View"

November, however, would take the top spot if prices find acceptance below $4,200, pushing the monthly loss above 32 percent. Indeed, BTC could regain some poise in the next ten days, as the record low on the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) is signaling extreme oversold conditions. In that case, November may become the second-worst month of the year or may even slip lower. However, a monthly loss looks like a done deal as a rally all the way back to $6,320 is unlikely to happen in the near-term. This is because the demand side pressures may have weakened significantly in the last few days. Moreover, a significant majority was expecting BTC to end its prolonged period of consolidation with a bullish breakout.

As such, the sanctions appear to be already impacting Iranians who want to make lawful use of cryptocurrencies.That’s why cryptocurrency miner Javad Sedighi in Isfahan, Iran, described the news to CoinDesk as “alarming,” because the stigma harms bitcoin users in the country.Sedighi has been using bitcoin for two years, mining and sending remittances to family abroad. Like many Iranians who rely on cryptocurrency to support their families, the political news made him worried about the security and privacy features in some bitcoin wallets.Some of the favored wallets among Iranians are Electrom, Atomic, Exodus, Samourai Wallet and Wasabi Wallet, especially its CoinJoin feature that sends many transactions in batches all at once to make it harder to track specific wallets. According to several Iranian developers, interest in the privacy coin zcash is also far more common these days.An anonymous developer in Tehran, who has traded ethereum for bitcoin on global exchanges then sent the bitcoin to his own wallet, concurred that security and privacy are the two primary attributes he looks for in a wallet.“Cutting a whole country off from global business is cruel,” the developer said, also affirming that laws should curtail criminal activity. However, most mainstream cryptocurrency exchanges like Coinbase will reject transactions connected to forbidden coins even several steps removed. As such, the criminal actions of a few may have ripple effects across Iran’s burgeoning community of retail buyers and users.One anonymous source in Tehran with personal knowledge of the sanctioned wallet-holders told CoinDesk they might have sold some of their ransomware-tied bitcoin to unsuspecting street traders, which are increasingly popular in Iran given their limited access to international exchanges.That’s why cryptocurrency trader and developer Sin Saad in Tehran is now pondering how the sanctions might impact his livelihood. He told CoinDesk:“How can I know these bitcoin are sanctioned? By constantly checking the Treasury, Federal Reserve, or OFAC website?”For less tech-savvy bitcoin users who might struggle with tracking blockchain data for specific coins, these listings present a significant risk. Meanwhile, Telegram wasn’t the only platform buzzing with talk of sanctions on Wednesday.Attorney Steve Middlebrook tweeted that anyone who received bitcoin from those sanctioned addresses should “hold the coins and notify the feds.” Stephen Palley, a partner at the Washington, D.C.-based law firm Anderson Kill, tweeted his support for this legal perspective.On the other hand, Attorney Nelson Rosario, who specializes in blockchain technology at Marshall, Gerstein & Borun LLP, tweeted an open question regarding how users could “clean” bitcoin from a sanctioned bitcoin wallet address. Could cooperating with U.S. authorities really help innocent bystanders avoid blacklists?In the meantime, the Iranian mining industry is booming with fresh crops of untainted bitcoin.Thanks to Iran’s subsidized electricity offerings that make cryptocurrency mining relatively affordable, mining operations continue to grow despite global price dips.“I’m trying to expand the mining industry and [bitcoin’s] use case for business in Iran,” Sedighi, the miner based in Isfahan, said, adding that he wants to help build a world with fewer sanctions and censorship. “Bitcoin users in Iran are mostly young people who are interested in technology.”Much like Sedighi, Tehran-based developer Saad said that political complications only boost their dedication to promoting mainstream adoption. Saad said:“We, as developers and traders, will find our route to make our dream a reality.”He added that promoting healthy networks of private bitcoin wallets, beyond corporate exchanges, is important because governments can only enact sanctions against individual people and banks that interact or indirectly receive bitcoin from an identified wallet.Governments cannot freeze privately held and operated bitcoin wallets themselves. So, the more that people store and transact with bitcoin by themselves, the less that lawful users need to fear discrimination.“When cryptos become so common and globally accepted, these measures don’t work,” said Saad.As such, choosing a bitcoin wallet with strong privacy features is important for those who, in some ways, are literally becoming their own banks.The anonymous developer in Tehran told CoinDesk that, despite the political tensions, bitcoin’s unique value proposition is inspiring more local engineers to learn about blockchain and start experimenting with uses of the tech.“Public adoption would be the best thing I can wish for,” he added.Iranian currency image via Shutterstock"

Further, as bitcoin makes up more than 50 percent of the entire market in terms of total capitalization, it’s safe to say the bear market may end when bitcoin bulls refuse to cede more ground.But in order for a true ‘bottom’ to be found, many figure a “capitulation” needs to take place, since it is traditionally the last stage of a prolonged bear market. By definition, capitulation is characterized by extreme panic selling backed by high volume that builds momentum until an eventual “bottom” is found. The bottom is a price level where the asset looks too cheap or undervalued to investors for them to allow it to fall any further. It’s difficult to consider something to have officially capitulated until after it has occurred, but by looking at previous capitulation stages and market bottoms for BTC, there are a few signs traders and investors alike can watch out for that may allude to an official market bottomFrom 2013-2015, BTC experienced a bear market similar to the one occurring now, in which it reached an all-time high of $1,163 in November, 2013 and eventually fell 86 percent to bottom out at $152 in January, 2015. From that day forward, the price never retreated below $152, according to data from the Bitstamp exchange.If that particular market bottom is an example of true capitulation, it’s clear there are two factors paramount to achieving capitulation: volume climaxes and rapid price declines. As can be seen in the above chart, the sell-off for BTC began to accelerate at the beginning of 2015, but did not reach an extreme until two weeks later.On Jan. 15, fear and panic in the market reached its peak. The price of BTC dropped 30 percent in a single 4-hour candlestick that was backed by its most sell volume in several months – an extreme selling event like this creates a volume climax which tends to be the precursor to a market bottom.The sign that likely cemented this point in time as the bottom was what followed the selling climax – even more buy volume. At this point, fear in the market officially met demand and those still interested in BTC considered the $152 price tag too cheap to let it slip any further. As can be seen below, the market is again experiencing a significant sell-off, but so far has been more gradual than the capitulation experienced in 2015.This is evident in that no single 4-hour candlestick has recorded more than a 9 percent loss whereas the single “market bottoming” four-hour candlestick in 2015 recorded a 30 percent loss.That said, sell volume has clearly picked up pace over the last couple of days and the current four-hour chart is showing promising signs for an “at least temporary” bottom. As can be seen in the above chart, sell volume is beginning to lessen and diverge from the falling price, a sign sell orders are drying up. What’s more, the last four-hour candle just bullishly engulfed the prior candlestick with a notable uptick in buying volume. A candle is considered to be ‘bullish engulfing’ when its body completely covers that of the prior candle, these types of candle tend to form at the bottom of downtrends but are more powerful the higher the timeframe. Should be noted, capitulation events do not immediately reverse the long-term trend of a market. After BTC bottomed out in Jan. 2015, it largely traveled sideways for another 10 months before beginning a new uptrend toward the end of the year.Such extreme selling events are also very rare, so it’s unlikely for the exact market conditions of 2015 to be replicated this time around. It’s safe to say though when true capitulation occurs, you’ll know.Disclosure: The author holds BTC, AST, REQ, OMG, FUEL, 1st and AMP at the time of writing.Bear market may be you image via Shutterstock; charts via TradingView"

On the other hand, an above-70 reading indicates overbought conditions.Essentially, the under-30 reading on the 14-week RSI indicates that the recent heavy selling from the highs above $6,200 may have reached a point of exhaustion. As a result, BTC may defend the immediate support at $3,179 (200-week moving average) in the short-run.Many experts also believe that RSI’s drop below 30.00 is followed by a strong corrective bounce. That’s not necessarily true as some markets enter into very strong trends, in which case the RSI can stay oversold or overbought for prolonged periods of times.Notably, BTC’s ongoing bear market is looking quite resilient, as the sell-off is backed by strong volumes. Hence, a strong bounce could remain elusive for some time, despite the oversold readings on the 14-week RSI.As of writing, BTC is trading at $3,390 on Bitstamp, representing a 2.3 percent drop on a 24-hour basis.The RSI dropped below the key support of 53.00 on the weekly chart in late January, signaling a bullish-to-bearish trend change. As of now, it’s holding in oversold territory below 30.00.It is worth noting that RSI’s January 2015 drop below 30.00 was short-lived and BTC soon picked up a bid in response to the oversold conditions.On the daily chart, the immediate outlook remains bearish as long as BTC is trading below the descending trendline.BTC failed to cut through the diagonal resistance yesterday, adding credence to the bearish setup on the 3-day chart.

At press time, the price stood at $3,770, representing a 1.5 percent drop on a 24-hour basis.Despite the quick recovery, the odds appear to be stacked in favor of a drop to recent lows below $3,500.To start with, BTC closed below $3,711 yesterday, invalidating the short-term bullish reversal signaled by last Wednesday’s 11 percent gains. The daily close also added credence to the bearish lower high carved out near $4,400 in the last few days.Added to that, the bearish setup on the long duration charts suggests strong potential for a deeper sell-off.That said, a minor recovery rally could be seen if prices cross resistance at $3,882 – upper edge of the falling wedge pattern – seen in the chart below.As seen above, BTC suffered a symmetrical triangle breakdown yesterday, signaling an end of the corrective bounce and a resumption of the sell-off.So, the immediate outlook remains bearish as long as prices are holding below the lower edge of the symmetrical triangle pattern (former support), currently at $3,850.BTC, however, has also established a falling wedge –  a bullish reversal pattern. Therefore, the outlook as per the hourly chart would turn bullish if prices cross $3,882 (upper edge of the wedge).The breakout, if confirmed, would open up upside toward $4,265 (Dec. 2 high) and possibly to $4,410 (Nov. 29 high).Securing that bullish breakout, however, could prove a tough task, as the major moving averages (50-, 100- and 200-hour) are trending south in favor of the bears.Securing that bullish breakout, however, could prove a tough task, as the major moving averages (50-, 100-, and 200-hour) are trending south in favor of the bears.Over on the daily chart, the lower high pattern, yesterday’s bearish close below $3,771 and the downward sloping 5- and 10-day exponential moving averages (MAs) continue to favor a re-test of $3,474 (Nov. 25 low).Notably, BTC struggled to close above the 10-day EMA during the recent corrective bounce. So, a daily close above that EMA, if and when it occurs, could be considered an advance signal of an impending bullish move.That said, a more credible evidence of a trend reversal would be a convincing break above $4,400.Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.Bitcoin image via Shutterstock; price charts by Trading View"

As a result, BTC fell below the 200-week exponential moving average (EMA) of $4,182 earlier today.The breach of the EMA support, however, may have trapped the bears on the wrong side of the market, as BTC is currently trading at $4,330 on Bitstamp, having clocked an intraday low of $4,061 earlier today.It is worth noting that the long-term EMA was first breached on Tuesday. The subsequent sell-off, however, ended at the 14-month low of $4,048 and prices recovered to $4,500 on the following day.The repeated failure to beat the long-term support indicates the bears have likely run out of steam. As a result, a stronger corrective rally could be in the offing.On the 4-hour chart, the relative strength index (RSI) has created a bullish divergence with higher lows.As a result, BTC looks set to test $4,635 – the neckline of the double-bottom bullish reversal pattern. A break above that, if confirmed, would open up upside toward $5,100 (target as per the measured height method).As seen above, the 14-day relative strength index is holding below 30.00 for the ninth day straight, signaling ongoing oversold conditions.The 5- and 10-day EMAs, currently at $4,546 and $4,933, respectively, are still trending south.

The views expressed here are his own.","—————————-The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been gone to significant lengths in an attempt to understand the crypto asset space. This effort is to be applauded. However, the SEC has failed to come to terms with one fundamental aspect of crypto assets and systems.Namely, properly constructed crypto systems do not involve “persons” or “entities” and do not represent a form of property. For this reason, they do not have any analogue in the traditional financial world, nor can they fall under financial regulation.In the traditional financial world, assets are a claim on a specific property. For example, a commodity, shares in a company or a debt owed.Crypto assets, however, are not a claim on anything. What is bitcoin a claim to? Or ether?Instead, crypto assets are a form of proof. They are cryptographic proof that a specific set of mathematical functions has been performed. They are proof that certain software instructions have been performed and of the algorithmic outputs of that software. And crucially, the mathematical functions are performed by nobody in particular, they are performed by the network as a whole.Property is “ownership determined by law.” Crypto assets are not property because they are not determined by law – they are determined by maths. This presents some obvious issues when it comes to figuring out exactly how to regulate them.Many people today speak of cryptocurrencies in the shorthand of property. They say things like “Alice transferred a bitcoin to Bob,” but we shouldn’t let this metaphor confuse us.In actual fact, there was no bitcoin that existed anywhere and it didn’t move from any one place to another.In “The Matrix,” Neo understood the true nature of the world when he understood that “there is no spoon.” Likewise, we can only understand the true nature of blockchain when we recognize that “there is no bitcoin.”Instead, what really happened is that Alice proved to Bob that she had certain secret knowledge and that she had used that knowledge to perform a mathematical operation. But wait, the rabbit hole goes even deeper.Even “Alice” and “Bob” are misleading fictions. Alice is not necessarily a person, that is shorthand too. Alice is really only an address – an output of a hash function, that may or may not be associated with a specific “entity.”Now, of course, sometimes Alice is a person. And sometimes Alice created a “token” (another metaphor) and sold it to Bob as an investment. In which case, arguably that was a securities offering and can be regulated by the SEC.However, the SEC doesn’t stop there. The agency wants to regulate what happens to those tokens, as they interact with smart contracts too. In its November 16 “Statement on Digital Asset Securities Issuance and Trading,” the agency says:“Any entity that provides a marketplace for bringing together buyers and sellers of securities, regardless of the applied technology, must determine whether its activities meet the definition of an exchange under the federal securities laws.”An “entity” here refers to a legal person.As an example, they use EtherDelta, and specifically its smart contract, saying:“EtherDelta’s smart contract was coded to, among other things, validate order messages, confirm the terms and conditions of orders, execute paired orders, and direct the distributed ledger to be updated to reflect a trade.”Here is where taking metaphorical thinking can easily go too far, and where the SEC is introducing vague and problematic language. EtherDelta, as an entity, provided various services (such as a webpage user interface for interacting with the smart contract). EtherDelta also developed the smart contract.But who “provided” the smart contract? Who performed its functions? Not EtherDelta or anyone else in particular.The SEC might regulate the EtherDelta website but to attempt to regulate the smart contract is a result of confusion.This confusion gets worse when the SEC talks about secondary markets for these “securities.”Crypto assets are so new that even many experienced practitioners are confused and think that they represent a distinct property. As a result, as an industry, we have been far too willing to indulge the SEC view that since something was the product of a securities offering, it remains a security thereafter. Once we realize that there are no “tokens” and no “property,” we realize that this is a categorical error.It becomes easy to see this error when one imagines the following scenario: Bob, having purchased the tokens from Alice sends them to a smart contract owned by nobody. He has given up claim of ownership – which would mean that no legal entity owns the “security.”By definition, a security is an “investment contract.” A contract is “an agreement between legal persons, creating obligations that are enforceable by law.”So for something to be a security, it must, therefore,  (a) be between legal entities and (b) be enforceable by law (not math).Tokens held by smart contracts fail both these tests. They cannot properly be described as securities. However, the SEC is suggesting something radically new: that a set of instructions which involves no agreement, no persons and is not enforced by law (but rather by math) can yet still be viewed not just as a contract but as a security. This is a radical departure from existing law.Property laws and financial laws rely on enforcement by governments. Since there are many governments and their jurisdictions are limited, there is no truly global system of enforcement that is appropriate to the borderless world of the internet.A huge potential benefit of crypto assets is that they overcome this problem — by not being a product of law or limited to its jurisdiction.The SEC, for obvious reasons, would like to establish jurisdiction over crypto assets. However, this jurisdiction is only appropriate where there are legally enforceable contracts between legal entities.For the SEC, or anyone, not to recognize this important distinction is a recipe for overreach and confusion. It has the potential to rob many of us for the benefits of a truly global, digital method of managing ownership and value.Missing the mark image via Shutterstock"

That drop marks the biggest monthly loss of the year so far.Amid the losses, trading volumes jumped by 33 percent month-on-month to $158.48 billion – the highest level since May.It is worth noting that, at the start of the month, BTC was already down close to 70 percent from the record high of almost $20,000 reached in December 2017. So, November’s losses essentially mark an extension of the bear market (which had supposedly bottomed out near $6,000) with a high-volume drop to 14-month lows below $3,500.But BTC’s failure to produce a meaningful bounce despite the repeated defense of the 21-month EMA in five months to October might have left investors disappointed, resulting in the increased sell-off as they left the market. Amid these signs of capitulation, it is still too early to call a long-term bottom.In the last few days, however, prices have recovered from lows below $3,500 – possibly just bargain hunting after the sell-off, but potentially the start of a corrective rally, as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) was reporting record oversold conditions a few days ago.On the monthly chart, BTC is set to close below the former support (now resistance) of the 21-month EMA for the first time since October 2015.A long-term bullish reversal would only be confirmed if and when prices clear the EMA, currently lined up at $5,977.On the 4-hour chart, BTC has fallen back below the double top neckline support at $4,120, having faced rejection at the falling trendline. As a result, the immediate bullish outlook has been neutralized.The recent low of $3,474 could come into play if the immediate support at $3,771 (low of Wednesday’s bullish reversal candle) is breached.A break above the falling trendline, if confirmed, would bolster the already bullish technical setup and could yield a stronger rally toward $5,000.Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.Bitcoin image via Shutterstock; price charts by Trading View"

This is the time when investors think nothing can go wrong and a self-feeding cycle is established: more investors enter the market for its stellar returns, leading to a further rise in price and valuations reach dizzying heights before, eventually, reality bites hard. The cryptocurrency market was gripped by euphoria in the last quarter of 2017. Bitcoin prices rose from $6,000 to $20,000 within seven weeks on speculation that futures launch would open floodgates for large institutions to buy cryptos. Further, every other altcoin, regardless of its fundamental story, had rallied to record highs by the first week of January. Most pundits came out with bitcoin targets of $50,000 or more at the time. The bubble, however, was pricked just two weeks into January by a regulatory crackdown in China and South Korea – two of the biggest sources of demand for cryptocurrencies back then. Since then, the bitcoin market has arguably gone through “complacency,” “anxiety” and “denial.”In this interpretation, the denial stage, it could be argued, lasted for five months as BTC’s repeated defense of $6,000 offered hope that the broader market and altcoins with strong fundamentals would recover lost ground before the year-end. Those hopes, however, were shattered as BTC nosedived below $6,000 on Nov. 14, pushing the bitcoin market into the “panic” stage, causing investors to look for an exit with no price floor in sight. The price of bitcoin has since fallen nearly 50 percent from the $6,000 mark, trading at an average price of $3,327 according to CoinDesk data at press time. More importantly, trading volumes jumped more than 30 percent month-on-month in November. That high-volume sell-off likely indicates many weaker hands have left the market.The argument for capitulation not having set in yet is that it is usually a single extreme selling event, short in duration but backed by a surge in sell volume and subsequent buy volume. As recent as Nov. 1, bitcoin suffered just that and it seems panic is still the most likely candidate for bitcoin’s current stage in its market cycle, at least until a break below the psychological price level of $3,000 incites capitulation.The result of capitulation is a lengthy period of sideways price action and misery felt by investors. So this leaves us studying the market cycle after recent violent price drops, searching for visual cues of a “bottoming out” of the current bear trend. And by having examined the different cycles it’s safe to assume bitcoin is close, but not quite there.The first stage after capitulation is ‘anger,’ when investors look for some reason for the horrific losses they’ve just experienced. Finally, reality sets in for investors who then shift from feeling anger to “depression” in regards to the financial state they are left in and this is when the bottom hits. When all hope in the market is lost in the eyes of the public, the market quietly starts to pick up a bid. At this stage, investors have been emotionally battered to the extent they will not believe any rally from here on out can be sustainable. Although it may be hard to grasp, this point of what seems like utter disaster can be seen as the point of maximum financial opportunity and minimum risk. With all the sellers now out of the market, accumulation at basement prices can begin, which eventually provides the energy for the start of the next market cycle. Like billionaire investor Warren Buffett famously said, be “fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.”Disclosure: The authors hold BTC, AST, REQ, OMG, FUEL, 1st, AMP and USDT at the time of writing.Roller-coaster image via Shutterstock, cheat sheet via wallstreetcheatsheet.com, charts by Trading View"

The dominant market narrative back then was that BTC would trim losses in the last few weeks of 2018, having bottomed out around $6,000 in five months to October.However, on Nov. 14, BTC nosedived below the crucial 21-month exponential moving average (EMA) support, signaling a resumption of the sell-off from the record high of $20,000 reached last December. As a result, prices ultimately dropped to 14-month lows below $3,500 on Nov. 25 before regaining some poise.With the bears still keeping the upper hand, a significant recovery from current levels appears unlikely before year’s end, and BTC looks set to snap its three-year winning streak with a 73 percent annual price drop – its biggest on record.if(""undefined""==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper[""SXOv6""]={},window.datawrapper[""SXOv6""].embedDeltas={""100"":655.0208339999999,""200"":548.0208339999999,""300"":522.0208339999999,""400"":495.020834,""500"":495.020834,""700"":469.020834,""800"":469.020834,""900"":469.020834,""1000"":469.020834},window.datawrapper[""SXOv6""].iframe=document.getElementById(""datawrapper-chart-SXOv6""),window.datawrapper[""SXOv6""].iframe.style.height=window.datawrapper[""SXOv6""].embedDeltas[Math.min(1e3,Math.max(100*Math.floor(window.datawrapper[""SXOv6""].iframe.offsetWidth/100),100))]+""px"",window.addEventListener(""message"",function(a){if(""undefined""!=typeof a.data[""datawrapper-height""])for(var b in a.data[""datawrapper-height""])if(""SXOv6""==b)window.datawrapper[""SXOv6""].iframe.style.height=a.data[""datawrapper-height""][b]+""px""});As seen in the table above, BTC’s only previous annual loss was a 57 percent drop in 2014.

oration ...","Nov 24, 2018 at 12:00 UTC","Richard Stallman, the fervently committed founder of the free software movement, is discussing the term “libertarian,” when he stops talking abruptly and says, “Hello?”","I tell him I’m still listening, but he explains that the confused greeting wasn’t intended for me. Instead, he says a man’s voice – neither mine nor an echo of his – had just cut in with one word: “liberty.”“Does that sort of thing happen a lot?” I ask. I hadn’t heard anything.“Yes,” he says. “It wasn’t a voice I recognize.” He added, “It could be … ”Then a quick burst of static made his next words inaudible.It was a strange incident, but apparently not a new experience for Stallman, whose emails urge any NSA or FBI agents reading to “follow Snowden’s example” and blow the whistle.Stallman seems to check all of the old school cypherpunk boxes: in addition to being an Edward Snowden admirer, he’s a hacker of the original ’70s and ’80s generation, a privacy activist, and a frequent invoker of liberty. As a result, cryptocurrency enthusiasts could be forgiven for thinking Stallman was also head-over-heels for bitcoin.He’s not.Before his oration on libertarianism was interrupted, he said that the right-wingers who made up a significant portion of bitcoin’s early adopters don’t really deserve the label. His own pro-freedom views are more “libertarian” than bitcoiners’ “anti-socialism,” he argued.As we spoke, it became clear that Stallman doesn’t find the decade-old technology all that appealing, for more reasons than just politics.“I have never used it myself,” he told CoinDesk.If that’s surprising, keep in mind that fine distinctions matter a great deal to Stallman. For example, he wrote a 9,000-word explainer on the difference between the terms GNU and Linux.In 40-ish words: GNU, which Stallman proposed in 1983, is an operating system using exclusively free software. Linux, created years later by Linus Torvalds, is a kernel. Many refer to packages combining the two as “Linux,” but Stallman insists that the proper term is GNU/Linux or just GNU.He also wrote 3,000 words on the differences between free software and open source software. Advocates of both push for the freedom to use, study, change and redistribute software, but Stallman said that those similarities conceal “a deeply important moral disagreement” centered on freedom and human rights, which the free software movement stresses.The GNU Project, which Stallman founded, is working on an alternative digital payments system called Taler, which is based on cryptography but is not – forgive the hair-splitting – a cryptocurrency.The Taler project’s maintainer Christian Grothoff told CoinDesk that the system is, rather, designed for a “post-blockchain” world.It doesn’t even seem like the technology has been around long enough to already be thinking of a world after it, but to Stallman, bitcoin isn’t suitable as a digital payment system.His biggest complaint: bitcoin’s poor privacy protections.He told CoinDesk, “What I’d really like is a way to make purchases anonymously from various kinds of stores, and unfortunately it wouldn’t be feasible for me with bitcoin.”Using a crypto exchange would allow that company and ultimately the government to identify him, he said. And as for mining the bitcoin himself, it’s a big investment and besides, he continued, “I’ve got other things I’d rather do.”Asked what he thought about so-called privacy coins, Stallman said he’d gotten an expert to assess their potential, and “for each one he would point out some serious problems, perhaps in its security or its scalability.”And speaking broadly, Stallman continued:“If bitcoin protected privacy, I’d probably have found a way to use it by now.”That pessimism aside, the GNU Project’s Taler does share some aspects with cryptocurrency projects – most notably it aims to fill the same niche.Start with Taler’s intellectual lineage. It’s based on blind signatures, a cryptographic technique invented by David Chaum, whose DigiCash was among the first attempts at creating secure electronic money. Plus, Taler’s attempt to create a digital money that resists surveillance by governments and payments companies aligns it with many cryptocurrency projects.Yet, Taler does not attempt to bypass centralized authority.Payments are processed by openly centralized “exchanges” rather than peer-to-peer networks of miners because, Grothoff said, such a system “would again enable dangerous, money laundering kind of practice.”Indeed, in a break with the anti-government ethos that has tended to characterize bitcoin and some of its peers, Taler’s design explicitly tries to block opportunities for tax evasion.Speaking to this, Stallman told CoinDesk, “We need a state to do many vital jobs, including fund research, fund education, provide people with medical care – provide everyone with medical care – build roads, maintain order, provide justice, including to those who are not rich and powerful, and so the state’s got to bring in a lot of money.”What a break from the political leanings of many of bitcoin’s first adherents.Stallman continued:“I wouldn’t want perfect privacy because that would mean it would be impossible to investigate crimes at all. And that’s one of the jobs we need the state to do.”Privacy in the Taler system, then, is limited to users spending their digital cash. They are shielded from surveillance because, Grothoff said, “the exchange, when coins are being redeemed, cannot tell if it was customer A or customer B or customer C who received the coin, because they all look identical from the exchange.”“Nobody,” he added, “exactly knows who has how many tokens.”Merchants (or anyone) receiving payments, on the other hand, do so visibly and in the open, making it possible for governments to assess taxes on their income – not to mention harder for the recipients to participate in money laundering.While Taler is not a cryptocurrency and doesn’t have a native asset (there are no talers or TalerCoins), as a new payment rail for existing assets, the system could support cryptocurrency at some point.Just as euros (the first currency that will be supported by the system), dollars and yen could all be sent using Taler, so could bitcoin.Similarly, while Taler is not a blockchain, a blockchain-based system could take the place of a bank within the system.For users to be able to move euros into the Taler wallet, though, Taler exchanges will need to interact with the traditional banking system to withdraw that money. In this same way, a blockchain-based system could work with Taler exchanges to allow users to get access to their cryptocurrency.Grothoff compared the act of moving bank deposits to a Taler digital wallet to taking cash out of an ATM. Coins in the wallet are stored locally on a user’s device, and if a user loses the key to their wallet, there’s nothing that can be done to recover it, much like the crypto space’s use of private/public key pairs.Currently, Taler is in talks with European banks to allow withdrawal into the Taler wallet and also re-deposit from the Taler system back into the traditional banking system.While the launch date on the project’s website still lists 2018, Grothoff said, it’s dependent of how quickly discussions with banks can be wrapped up. And he said, “The banks are not necessarily easy or cheap to deal with.”Although, nothing about the traditional banking system per se is essential to Taler’s functioning (except perhaps for regulatory compliance). In principle, the “register-based system” that Taler plugs into could be a bank account or, in theory, a blockchain, said Grothoff.If Taler gains traction, developers can experiment with different implementations and integrations – using banks or blockchains or whatever other register system they prefer. After all, Grothoff said:“It’s free software.”Stallman image via Wikimedia Commons/NicoBZH"

They then need to enter tax details such as payment amount and tax period, and, finally, the due amount is paid in bitcoin using a “compatible” crypto wallet, according to the portal.Compatible wallets include the Bitcoin Core client, Mycelium and breadwallet, and others that are compatible with the Bitcoin Payment Protocol.All tax payments will be processed by Atlanta-based bitcoin payments processor BitPay, which will convert bitcoins to dollars for the Treasurer’s office.While, for now, the facility is available only for businesses, it is reportedly expected to be made available to individuals in the future.Lawmakers in other U.S. states have also considered allowing crypto tax payments in the past. Back in March, Illinois  and  Arizona were both weighing proposals to allow residents to pay their tax bills in bitcoin. Georgia was also considering the option in February.However, Arizona’s lawmakers scrapped the plan two months later due to insufficient votes for the proposal. Similarly, Georgia’s proposal also stalled in April, due to a “lack of understanding” about cryptocurrency, said Senator Mike Williams at the time.Ohio has also been working to bring other aspects of blockchain technology into law. Over the summer, the state legally recognized data stored and transacted on a blockchain, meaning electronic signatures secured through blockchain technology have the same legal standing as any other electronic signatures.In the same month, Ohio lawmakers also pitched their state as a future hub for blockchain, hoping to both attract companies in the space and blockchain talent to the jurisdiction.Ohio state flags image via Shutterstock"

At that time, the cryptocurrency was trading around its record high near $20,000, while at the time of writing, it is valued at $4,167 according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). Google trend data further reveals that the most searches for bitcoin in the world over the past week came from Nigeria, South Africa and Austria, in that order. Interestingly, the U.S. barely cracked into the top-20, ranking in at 19. The seven-month high in Google searches for bitcoin perhaps should not come as a surprise since the cryptocurrency made headlines last week for its price falling to a 13-month low below $4,000. Data further reveals the searches for bitcoin more than doubled on the day it entered the $3,000 range, Nov. 24.That said, it has long been speculated that the price of bitcoin and its Google search trends are highly correlated, which suggests the uptick may be a sign of things to come for bitcoin’s price.A study conducted in 2017 by researcher Willy Woo shows that the Google search trends can even be used to detect speculative bubbles as well as the best and worst times to buy the cryptocurrency.In other words, periods of low ‘bitcoin’ search volume have historically shown to be the points of maximum financial opportunity, whereas periods of abnormally high search volume tend to act as a warning sign that bitcoin is in a bubble and may soon experience a pullback in price.Disclosure: The author holds BTC, AST, REQ, OMG, FUEL, 1st and AMP at the time of writing.Image Credit:BigTunaOnline / Shutterstock.com"

What's more, cryptocurrency exchanges that froze ...","Nov 21, 2018 at 05:20 UTC",It’s been six days since the bitcoin cash split and neither side looks ready to call it quits.,"What’s more, cryptocurrency exchanges that froze holdings of bitcoin cash in lead-up to Thursday’s contentious hard fork activation are beginning to warm up to idea that bitcoin cash may remain two cryptocurrencies.On Tuesday, Coinbase, one of the largest U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchanges, affirmed it was “now prepared to resume limited trading in [bitcoin cash],” designating the Bitcoin “Adjustable Blocksize Cap” or Bitcoin ABC chain with the bitcoin cash (BCH) ticker.In addition, Coinbase added that its intention was to eventually “support withdrawal services for the [Bitcoin Cash “Satoshi Vision” or Bitcoin SV] chain” but that development work for this would likely take “at least a few weeks.”Other exchanges such as Poloniex and Bitfinex have already begun supporting active trading for both networks, simply doing away with the original BCH symbol entirely and differentiating the two cryptocurrencies as BCHABC or BAB and BCHSV or BSV.In addition, data from Coin Dance indicates that the Bitcoin ABC chain is leading Bitcoin SV both in terms of block count and proof of work.Despite the clear disadvantage in terms of market price and the number of blocks mined, proponents of Bitcoin SV affirm that plans to eventually outpace the Bitcoin ABC blockchain are unwavering.Craig Wright, a leading Bitcoin SV proponent and the chief scientist at nChain – which developed the Bitcoin SV roadmap – told CoinDesk that “We’re still competing. This is going to take some time. This is not a split, this is one survives and one dies and it is not going to be us that dies.”Explaining that the Bitcoin SV chain would ultimately come out as the victor by “bankrupting” the other side, Wright contended that the current computational energy or “hash power” supporting the Bitcoin ABC network was unsustainable. Predicting that an eventual slowdown to hash power would enable Bitcoin SV to overtake the ABC chain and shut it down completely, Wright referred to his tactics as “persistence hunting.”However, on the Bitcoin ABC side, proponents such as Roger Ver, CEO of mining pool bitcoin.com claim that the current hash power going to mine blocks on Bitcoin ABC can sustainably run for months.In a weekly rundown of bitcoin cash news on the official Bitcoin.com Youtube channel, Ver said:“It’s none of your business where the hash rate came from and it’s not for a single day, it’s for as long as we want. We can go for a single decade if we need to so bring it baby.”As such, the competition between Bitcoin ABC and Bitcoin SV is far from finished given persisting sentiment that a hostile takeover of either chain is well within the realm of possibility.Wright claims that over the long haul his network will accumulate enough hash power to launch a 51 percent attack – which simply indicates possession of the majority of computing energy on the Bitcoin ABC network to create invalid transactions and blocks.This has been an ongoing threat posed even before hard fork activation on Thursday.Though most assumed such an attack would be imminent after the Bitcoin ABC chain took the lead in creating the longest-running bitcoin cash chain, Wright explained to CoinDesk that his method of fighting – which he called “persistence hunting” – was never about “quick bursts” of activity.“We follow behind, we track them, we keep them on their tails, we basically make them expend money until they burn out,” said Wright.But speaking to the possibility of a 51 percent attack, bitcoin cash developer and supporter for Bitcoin ABC Chris Pacia emphasized in a Medium post published Saturday that certain measures had already been put in place to prevent massive reorganizations to validated blocks on the ABC chain.Called checkpoints, the additional software unique to the Bitcoin ABC network ensures that no proposals to replace or “reorg” blocks before a certain “checkpoint” can be approved on the blockchain – no matter if the proposal is made by the longest running chain.Though criticized as being against the core principles of reaching consensus on the blockchain, Pacia asserts that the technology of checkpoints has been widely used since 2010 even by the pseudonymous creator of bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, to safeguard the blockchain against 51 percent attacks.It’s important to note that the implemented checkpoint on Bitcoin ABC does not prevent possible reorgs of blocks created after hard fork activation.Only blocks before the checkpoint are safe from malicious attacks by a competing blockchain, meaning, as Pacia hints in his article, they are useful to prevent against a 51 percent attack by Bitcoin SV miners “mining a hidden chain” since before the bitcoin cash split.With new blocks being created each day on Bitcoin ABC, the likelihood of a 51 percent attack at present sabotaging any of these blocks through Bitcoin SV hash power is not out of the question.However, Bitcoin ABC developer and miner Jonathan Toomim told CoinDesk there are a series of options.First, the Bitcoin ABC chain can continue to mine at a loss to the bitcoin blockchain as suggested by Ver. Bitcoin ABC can also revert hash power to bitcoin and only redirect as necessary to the network when under threat of an imminent Bitcoin SV attack. Finally, on the matter of block reorgs, Toomim suggests:“There are also some technical solutions to protect against reorg attacks even without hash rate, like writing code that simply prevents reorgs that are more than six blocks deep. If we do either of those two things then we can get revenue parity with BTC while still keeping [Bitcoin ABC] safe from attack.”When asked whether an alternative counterstrike on the Bitcoin SV network by Bitcoin ABC miners was possible, Toomim affirmed that while “ABC could attack SV with hash power superiority …. we choose not to.”“The ABC side believes that anybody who wants to implement a coin with their own ruleset is welcome to do so. They may create and innovate freely without asking anybody for permission … [Bitcoin ABC] has not used [hash power] to destroy BSV because that would be a violation of our beliefs. We prefer not to launch preemptive attacks,” said Toomim.Still, the reality is that both Bitcoin SV and Bitcoin ABC miners are mining at a loss.According to figures on Coin Dance, bitcoin cash miners would make 75 percent more profit by mining the bitcoin blockchain than either the Bitcoin SV or Bitcoin ABC chain.This is especially pertinent to mining pools such as Ver’s bitcoin.com, which has purposely redirected hash power away from mining bitcoin (BTC) to mine bitcoin cash (BCH).But unlike before the split, the price of bitcoin cash is far from what it once was.According to markets data site TradingView, the price of bitcoin cash a day prior to hard fork activation hit a high of $504.04. Since its creation, Bitcoin ABC has barely shot over a price of $300.What’s more, though Bitcoin SV reached a peak of $170.97 shortly after launching, the cryptocurrency has since declined steadily in value over the course of the past six days to sit roughly at $60.00.As a result, several proponents of the wider cryptocurrency space assert that at present heavy losses are being experienced on both sides.Saying that “everyone lost” and that damage had been done to the reputations of leaders on both the Bitcoin ABC and SV side, Ryan X Charles – CEO of online payments platform MoneyButton – affirmed with CoinDesk that events were “not over yet.”Agreeing with this sentiment,  Taariq Lewis – CEO of digital payments network Promise Protocols – also affirmed that while the split had “hurt the cryptocurrency’s perceived value” in the markets, his prediction was that both Bitcoin ABC and SV would continue to “survive.”“They will both survive. [Dogecoin] survives and Bitcoin Gold survives. We have precedent that as long as a cryptocurrency has a community, it will not die,” said Lewis.As such, the question remains: will Bitcoin ABC continue to maintain the lead as the dominant bitcoin cash network or falter to suffer network attacks promised by Bitcoin SV miners who themselves may or may not have the resources to support such operations in the long-run?At the end of day, the expected outcome to the ongoing bitcoin cash controversy as highlighted by bitcoin.com CEO Roger Ver doesn’t look to be a “win” for either side.Boxing gloves image via Shutterstock"
19,www.coindesk.com,"Dec 11, 2018",Not Everyone Wants a Bitcoin ETF,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoiners-bitcoin-etf-crypto,"While many traders eagerly await a potential bitcoin exchange-traded fund 
(ETF), some of the cryptocurrency's most passionate advocates are ...","Dec 11, 2018 at 10:00 UTC","While many traders eagerly await a potential bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), some of the cryptocurrency’s most passionate advocates are lukewarm at best about the prospect of such an instrument.","Twitter is flush with users like crypto entrepreneur Jonathan Hamel posting about how an ETF would bring an “epic” inflow of institutional capital to the ecosystem – that is, “billions” of dollars in new investments.But if you talk to early adopters and veteran technologists in the bitcoin community, you’ll hear resounding indifference, if not queasiness.“I don’t think an ETF is going to be some kind of massive magnet,” Pierre Rochard, founder of the Brooklyn-based Bitcoin Advisory LLC, told CoinDesk. “Demand will continue to be driven by sentiment, rather than the availability of specific products.”Last week, the U.S. Securities and Exchange postponed plans to reevaluate ETF proposals from financial institutions such as VanEck and SolidX to as late as February 27, 2019. This means two more months of nail-biting for those who believe the ETF would be a huge boon to bitcoin or the savior of the overall crypto marketplace.And yet, in reference to Grayscale’s Bitcoin Investment Trust, which launched in 2015, bitcoin analyst Nik Bhatia told CoinDesk:“I don’t see the additional ETFs improving bitcoin’s liquidity any more than the GBTC already does.”Although Bhatia said he would nevertheless welcome a regulator-approved ETF because it might increase public trust in this new asset class, some crypto veterans went as far as to say an ETF could actually be harmful to the broader ecosystem. To them, an ETF contradicts the vision of a peer-to-peer financial network fueled by self-custodied assets.“It’s kind of a centralizing force and the value proposition of bitcoin is it’s decentralized, global,” Lightning Labs developer Alex Bosworth told CoinDesk.For Bosworth, the biggest risk that a bitcoin ETF presents is that it might incentivize institutions to work collectively to influence the ecosystem.Referring to the thwarted New York Agreement in 2017 – when leading crypto companies planned to support unpopular bitcoin network updates simultaneously despite public outcry – Bosworth explained:“We saw companies that are custodians for other people’s coins, talking as if they hold those coins and take actions that decide, on behalf of their users, without even consulting them…We don’t want to have central parties out there negotiating for fundamental rule changes in bitcoin.”This is the same reason that bitcoin veteran Christopher Allen, the former principal architect at Blockstream, distrusts the institutions that are working to create a regulated bitcoin ETF.“The real reason they are doing it is they can play financial games to make them a much higher interest rate than what they would otherwise,” Allen told CoinDesk. “I think there are a lot of implications of that. How do we educate people on what fiduciary responsibility and custody really is?”Bhatia agreed that the industry is transitioning to prioritize a “trusted custody model,” but doesn’t think such institutional products will have a significant impact on cypherpunk traditionalists.“People that currently store their own bitcoin aren’t going to rush into the ETF because they’re not looking for the same things,” he said.Other bitcoin veterans are concerned retail investors are putting more faith in an ETF’s ability to rescue sinking cryptocurrency prices than the prospective product actually deserves.If approved in the near future, Rochard said, he expects bitcoin ETFs would make up an even smaller percentage of the market than gold ETFs, which he estimated represent less than 2 percent of the global gold supply.“We’re talking about a very niche part of the market that would be interested in a bitcoin ETF product,” Rochard said. “It would be even less than gold is used in an ETF because the overall settlement cost of bitcoin is lower than those of physically settling gold.”Others say any boost to the price might be short-lived.During CoinDesk’s Consensus: Invest conference in November, BlockTower Capital’s chief investment officer Ari Paul warned the audience to recall how the addition of bitcoin futures boosted short-term speculation far more than institutional commitment. The price settled back down within months.“If an ETF was launched, it’s not that there would suddenly be massive institutional flows. I think on the announcement you’d get a massive rally,” Paul said. “That’s not because you suddenly get $50 million [in] institutional investors’ money, it’s because speculators price it in.”And it’s important to remember that any euphoria (or anxiety) about a bitcoin ETF is still academic.On December 5, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce told the audience during fireside chat in Washington D.C. not to “hold your breath,” because a regulator-approved bitcoin ETF could still be years away. She added:“I do caution people to not live or die on when a crypto or bitcoin ETF gets approved.”Even if an ETF were to be approved, bitcoin advocates question how this structure – in which a fund owns underlying assets and divides ownership of them into shares – would address the idiosyncrasies of cryptocurrency.For example, what if there’s another fork of the network, like the one that create bitcoin cash last year?“Do they [ETF custodians] give the coins back to people or do they suddenly become an index fund?” Rochard said. “I don’t think there’s a precedent at all [from capital markets], because bitcoin doesn’t have a legal identity and corporations do.”Allen said ETF issuers would need to clarify how they store and tally their bitcoin, so that products representing this underlying assets wouldn’t be loaned out over and over in a process called rehypothecation. As Caitlin Long, co-founder of the Wyoming Blockchain Coalition, wrote in a Forbes column, rehypothecation is antithetical to the bitcoin ethos because there is a finite bitcoin supply, 21 million at max.As such, there’s no way to bail out lenders if borrowers were owed more bitcoin than the ETF-issuer actually possessed.“Substantively, it’s really not that much different than fractional reserve banking,” Rochard said.However, Gabor Gurbacs, the director of digital asset strategy for VanEck, told CoinDesk his company’s proposal would involve cold storage, daily disclosures to defuse any concerns about rehypothecation, and a handbook of regulator-approved index fund procedures to follow in the case of a bitcoin fork.“We intend to stay true to the core tenets of bitcoin,” Gurbacs said, adding that ETF holders would be primarily exposed to the asset defined by Bitcoin Core unless another chain became dominant and equally secure.“I don’t see any operational issues. I think we’ve figured it out and we’re waiting for the regulators to make a decision on this,” he went on to explain.Like many bitcoin advocates, Rochard said that anything which boosts bitcoin’s overall liquidity – even modestly – is a good thing.On the other hand, he sympathized with the skeptical indifference many technologists feel toward financial institutions.“It would be really unfortunate if people lose sight of why bitcoin has value,” Rochard said. “But it would be such a small part of the market, so there’d be limited impact on that.”Businessman on dart board image via Shutterstock"

Trading and warehouse operations are both expected to begin on that date.The platform explained that “the new listing timeframe will provide additional time for customer and clearing member onboarding prior to the start of trading and warehousing of the new contract.”In an announcement on Medium, Bakkt CEO Kelly Loeffler expanded on this statement, saying that the “volume of interest” in the company and the “work required to get all the pieces in place” contributed to the delay.She added:“As is often true with product launches, there are new processes, risks and mitigants to test and re-test, and in the case of crypto, a new asset class to which these resources are being applied. So, it makes sense to adjust our timeline as we work with the industry toward launch.”Bakkt previously anticipated launching its futures trading next month, saying in a notice that it would launch the product on Dec. 12. The new date is still subject to regulatory approval, indicating that the platform may not have received such approval yet.The platform previously revealed it would launch physically-settled bitcoin futures, meaning clients would receive bitcoin upon the expiration of their contracts, rather than the token’s cash equivalent.However, the company may offer more than just bitcoin futures, Loeffler hinted Tuesday. Later in her post, she noted that “we are taking opportunities in our start-up phase to expand our offering.”“We’ll share more about some of these new features in the coming weeks but as a start, I’m pleased to announce that we have insurance for bitcoin in cold storage and are in the process of securing insurance for the warm wallet within the Bakkt Warehouse architecture,” she said.The company is focused on building an institutional-grade cryptocurrency warehouse, she said, adding that “we … believe this is a significant step in building confidence in this asset class.”As part of its efforts to develop the product, Bakkt previously announced it was working with BCG, Microsoft and Starbucks. The companies provided assistance in both customer experience and risk management for the product.ICE image via ICE Data Services / Twitter"

Usually if [bitcoin] goes up, we would put prices up. Well, I thought I’m going to try something different.”After recent negativity in the industry around issues like the bitcoin cash “hash war,” he said: “Now’s the time to celebrate, we’re at a bottom.”“We’re agnostic when it comes to what people want to mine. We want to make sure big miners are staying committed and stay hopeful,” Mosher added.Canaan is one of several miner manufacturers to have moved to go public via for an initial public offering (IPO) in the last year. However, its effort to go public now looks in doubt, as its filing with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEX) has now lapsed.As Mosher indicated, the flash sale comes amid a tough period for crypto miners.Last week, the founder of the third-largest mining pool, F2Pool, estimated that between 600,000 and 800,000 bitcoin miners have shut down since mid-November. Mao Shixing said the estimate takes into account the total network hash rate drop and the average hash power of older mining machines that are having a hard time generating profits.Canaan also revealed new firmware for its miners today that its says reduces power consumption to 0.085 j/Gh.Bitcoin miners image via Shutterstock"

According to a report from local news outlet Aftenposten, in its state budget, the government said that cryptocurrency miners in the country will have to pay normal electricity tax from the New Year.At the moment, larger mining firms receive the same electricity tax discount as other power-intensive industries in the country. Those with a capacity of more than 0.5 megawatts are charged only 0.48 øre ($0.00056) per kilowatt hour instead of the standard rate of 16.58 øre ($0.019). An øre is 100th of a Norwegian krone.That means that eligible miners have been paying just 2.8 percent of the standard tax rate to power their rigs.“Norway can not continue to provide huge tax incentives for the most dirty form of cryptographic output like bitcoin. It requires a lot of energy and generates large greenhouse gas emissions globally,” Norwegian parliamentary representative Lars Haltbrekken said in the report.Now with an end to the subsidy, bitcoin miners will have to shell out higher taxes, which is likely to reduce their net profits at a time when low crypto prices are already putting pressure on the industry.Just this Monday, U.S.-based bitcoin mining firm Giga Watt declared bankruptcy, revealing in court documents that it still owes its biggest 20 unsecured creditors nearly $7 million. That number includes claims to hundreds of thousands of dollars by two power providers to the firm.The suggestion to remove Norway’s subsidy was reportedly proposed by the Norwegian Tax Administration, an agency under the authority of the country’s Ministry of Finance. That proposal has now been approved in the state budget and will be effective from January 2019.Roger Schjerva, chief economist of tech industry interest body, ICT Norway, told Aftenposten:“This is shocking. Budgets have changed framework conditions without discussion, consultation or dialogue with the industry,”Removing the subsidy will push crypto miners to Sweden and Denmark, he argued, adding that the country mustn’t “just say no to income and work in many municipalities in Norway.”Editor’s note: Quotes have been informally translated from Norwegian.Electricity pylon image via Shutterstock "

Back then, BTC was changing hands around $220, according to Bitstamp data.The breach of long-term support, however, was short-lived as record low readings on the relative strength index (RSI) likely put a bid under BTC, helping it regain some poise.At press time, BTC is changing hands at $4,440, having clocked a 14-month low of $4,048 yesterday.Notably, the recovery has established the 200-week EMA as the level to watch out for in the near-term. The already bearish technical setup would be bolstered further if the cryptocurrency finds acceptance below the long-term EMA support, leading to a deeper drop below the psychological support of $3,000.As can be seen above, the 78.6 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from 2015 lows to 2017 highs lines up at $4,328 – just above the 200-week EMA of $4,180. So, it seems safe to say that the area between $4,100 and $4,350 is packed with key support lines.The chart also shows that a break below the 200-week EMA could prove costly as the next major support is seen directly at $3,130 – the widely followed 200-week simple moving average.Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.image via Shutterstock; Charts by Trading View"

It further warned that cryptocurrencies are “purely speculative and are not currencies” and that those who wish to invest in bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency “do it entirely at their own risk.”There are 25,000 tobacco outlets across France, according to the tobacconist federation’s website, potentially making bitcoin widely available if the scheme is a success.The news comes as bitcoin is experiencing a significant downturn in prices.

At press time, that figure is hovering around 55.1 percent. The dominance rate is a metric used to measure the percent market share of a particular asset in cryptocurrency market. What the development suggests is that traders may be shifting funds from alternative cryptocurrencies into the world’s largest coin by market capitalization – or at the very least, demand for bitcoin is outpacing other networks.Bitcoin has always maintained the largest share of the cryptocurrency market, even when its dominance rate hit an all time low of 32 percent on Jan. 13 of this year. At the time, the alternative cryptocurrency market (or the crypto market excluding bitcoin) had seen its total capitalization increased nearly 24,000 percent over the course of the prior year, which ate away a considerable amount of bitcoin’s overall market share.Since then, the alternative cryptocurrency market has depreciated more than 90 percent in terms of total capitalization from its record high of $550 billion. Bitcoin’s price has struggled to retain its value, too, haven fallen over 80 percent since its all-time high was recorded in December 2017. Yet it’s still clearly the preferred cryptocurrency even in a risk-off market, where mitigating risk is a top priority – a claim shored up by its rising dominance rate. Disclosure: The author holds BTC, AST, REQ, OMG, FUEL, 1st and AMP at the time of writing.ladder image via Shutterstock"

And it was Intel’s foundry that produced the chips for the mining operation run by 21 Inc, which later rebranded as Earn.com and was ultimately acquired by Coinbase.Per the patent, bitcoin miners may be rewarded for their efforts by receiving a block reward and transaction fees. However, mining machines for the bitcoin network generally require hardware accelerators, such as application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), and therefore require a large amount of energy.Hardware accelerators are needed in particular for processing 32-bit nonces, strings of bits used once during a transaction. Current ASICs process these transactions in multiple stages with redundancies.As the patent explains:“Dedicated Bitcoin mining ASICs are used to implement multiple SHA-256 engines that may deliver a performance of thousands of hashes per second while consuming power of greater than 200 [watts]. Embodiments of the present disclosure employ micro-architectural optimizations including selective hardwiring certain parameters in Bitcoin mining computation.”Hardwiring these parameters would lower the number of computations required, it says, estimating that such a system would reduce the amount of power needed for a chip by 15 percent. The resulting chip would also be smaller than those used for bitcoin miners at present.The patent also hints that changing how much of the 32-bit nonce is compared for validity could further lower power requirements.“Instead of comparing the final hashing result with the target value, [the] bitcoin mining application may determine whether the hash out has a minimum number of leading zeros,” the patent states.Intel image via jejim/Shutterstock"

He admits to converting bitcoin to Iranian rials for both of the individuals listed by the FBI, Mohammad Mehdi Shah Mansouri and Faramarz Shahi Savandi, over several years, but says he had no reason to suspect them of any wrongdoing.At the very least, his perspective raises questions about how black markets and grassroots bitcoin adoption overlap, especially in regions with opaque regulatory requirements.The U.S. Treasury had no comment when reached.What follows is a transcript of CoinDesk’s interview with Ghorbaniyan, as conducted through a translator.Q: How did you meet Mansouri and Savandi, the alleged hackers associated with the SamSam ransomware virus?A: I didn’t know the SamSam criminal activities were associated with the bitcoins I received from these two customers and I’m honestly still not sure if these two people are behind the SamSam crimes.They used common messenger apps like Telegram and WhatsApp. This is the most common way to buy and sell bitcoin in Iran. They were like any other customer I’ve had over the years.I do a standard know-your-customer (KYC) procedure. And there’s no reason to be suspicious of my customers once they do KYC.Q: What was your KYC procedure like?A: KYC for buying/selling bitcoin in Iran involves a selfie with bank account cards and national ID cards for the person in the selfie, plus a telephone number.Q: Why did you say that you are unsure if those individuals are behind the SamSam ransomware?A: In one of their chats with me, they declared that they’ll be selling 50 bitcoins by themselves, and they don’t need an exchanger for that deal. Therefore, I don’t know, there is a possibility that they were exchangers as well.At any time, if needed, I’m ready to give all data regarding my trades with them to the Iranian cyber police and the cyber police can submit this data to the international authorities for further proceedings.I’ve never done any criminal activities with these two people and if I knew that any of our customers are associated with criminal activities then I would refrain from doing business with them.Unfortunately, our names have been declared by the United States Treasury as associated with criminal activities without receiving any contact from the Treasury. We are accused of something we haven’t done! I was not aware of any criminal activities from our customers and I have not committed a crime.Q: Most regulated exchange businesses in the United States have strict policies for precisely this reason. Even if that is not the requirement in Iran, why don’t you require more information in order to track the capital flows?A: We are an Iranian exchange and we work under the law of our country, Iran, according to the rules of the Iranian cyber police. We, as exchangers, record all the data about our trades. This includes screenshots from chats and KYC data from our customers. We never violated the laws of our country.Is there a database declaring the bitcoins that are associated with criminal activity? If I was trying to do criminal activities wouldn’t I be more concerned with hiding my identity? You could find my bank, phone numbers and bitcoin address publicly available on my website! Why should I give out such info if I were to take part in criminal activities? This is enough evidence and arguments to prove I’m innocent of any charges!I met with the Iranian cyber police last weekend to talk about next steps. I hope the U.S. makes things right and takes my name off that list.Before accusing people of criminal activities, the Treasury must notify the international police to request data and explanations from the Iranian police, which would have come to us. We could have stopped this misunderstanding and wrong accusations.Tehran statue image via Shutterstock"

These miners have an average hash power of around 10 TH/s and are estimated to be losing money right now, according to F2pool’s miner revenue index. In fact, the bitcoin hashrate on F2pool, which now accounts for about 11.4 percent of the total network, has also seen a decline of over 10 percent in recent weeks, Mao said.“It’s hard to calculate a precise number of miners connected to us that had unplugged. But we saw over tens of thousands of them [shut down] in the past several days based on conversations we had with larger farms that we are in regular contact with,” he said, adding:“This is what’s happening among miners in China.”On Nov. 20, Mao shared via his Weibo social media account a photo of a man packing computer gear into boxes, with the caption “shutting down is not an option, now have to sell by the kilos.” The post was widely taken to mean even mining equipment of recent vintage was being sold off by the kilogram in China, but Mao told CoinDesk he was half-kidding when he wrote it, explaining:“Those miners being sold by the kilos are even older and obsolete models that aren’t usable anymore. So people are selling to recycle [them] like copper instead of for further mining purposes.”Stepping back, Mao said there are multiple factors that contributed to the shakeout among miners, including the recent market decline that followed the bitcoin cash hard fork on Nov. 15; an increase in electricity costs in China; and the fact that Chinese manufacturers are still racing to upgrade their products, making older machines increasingly uncompetitive. “All these factors are overlapping right now which led to this recent phenomenon,” Mao said. As the winter comes in China, hydropower plants are experiencing a dry season when electricity costs have doubled from what they would have been in the summer when water was abundant.During the summer, Mao said, electricity costs in China’s mountainous Southwestern region, where lots of mining farms reside, could go below 0.2 yuan, or $0.029, per 1 KW/h. But at this time of the year, that is going up to above 0.3 yuan ($0.043).  While other fossil fuel power stations, for instance in China’s Xinjiang province, may generate electricity at a steadier rate, the overall costs are still at least about 0.28 yuan ($0.04) per 1KW/h, Mao said.As bitcoin’s price recently tanked to a 13-month low below $4,000, mining farms that have been using machines made in 2016 and 2017 with lower productivity just can’t break even, Mao added.To be sure, the fact that mining farms have unplugged does not necessarily mean they are out of the game completely. “Bitcoin mining is always a dynamically adjusted process,” Mao said, meaning when the hashrate drops, so does the mining difficulty. The latest data shows the bitcoin mining difficulty has already declined slightly by 5 percent within the past a few days. This dynamically adjusted process could give those who haven’t thrown in the towel an incentive to stick around, Mao said, concluding:“The change of bitcoin’s mining difficulty normally has a lag of about 14 days [following hashrate change]. After this wave of shutdowns, those players who opted to stay in may have a better life.”Mao Shixing image courtesy to F2pool"

half of the bitcoin and ether it raised for fiat. The sales were 
well-timed ...","Dec 5, 2018 at 13:00 UTC",Cash is king – especially during a crypto winter.,"That’s the takeaway from a report out Wednesday from the Aion Foundation, which raised $23 million worth of bitcoin, ether and fiat through a token sale in October 2017. Compiled with the help of Deloitte, though not formally audited by the Big Four accounting firm, the report details how Aion has been managing its crypto war chest, providing a rare level of transparency for a token project.According to Aion Foundation CEO Matt Spoke, the foundation has sold off half of the bitcoin and ether it raised for fiat. The sales were well-timed to take advantage of the gains in crypto prices through the beginning of 2018.Even after spending more than $10 million launching its unique blockchain platform and opening offices in Canada, Barbados, and China, the nonprofit had $14 million left as of October 31 of this year, $5.8 million of it in fiat, the report shows.“We’ve liquidated a decent amount of our bitcoin and eth that we raised as proceeds to make sure that we are stable in this type of period,” Spoke told CoinDesk, adding:“As we continue to spend in our operations we’ll end up liquidating more bitcoin and eth over the course of the next few months”The Aion protocol already has active users such as the video game startup ClanPlay experimenting with how this network could support applications, Spoke said, but for now the nonprofit will “lean more heavily on cash” to fund its growth.The foundation has roughly 18 months of runway, Spoke estimated, and it will take up to five years for the network to offer services comparable to centralized alternatives like Amazon Web Services. in addition to currently supporting the Ethereum Virtual Machine, Aion is scheduled to support its own Aion Virtual Machine, so developers can use can use Java tools to build decentralized software by Q2 2019.In the meantime, Spoke said his team might seek additional funding from crypto funds and accredited investors in return for Aion tokens.The goal is to avoid layoffs for the foundation’s 61-person team by modeling itself somewhat like the ethereum-centric conglomerate ConsenSys, led by Joseph Lubin, in that the foundation would sponsor projects across the network.Going forward, the foundation will publish quarterly updates and annual reports and participate in the Messari disclosure database to boost token holders’ confidence.Aion tokens are currently traded on more than two dozen exchanges, including large ones such as Binance and Bitfinex, according to CoinMarketCap.Despite that apparent liquidity, Meltem Demirors, founder of Shiny Pony Ventures and chief strategy officer at the asset manager CoinShares, expressed concern that the foundation listed its holdings of Aion tokens as assets on its balance sheet.“I think they should be really careful about that,” Demirors said. “I don’t think that we’ve definitely proven the token model works.”Both she and Nic Carter, co-founder of Castle Island Ventures, warned against viewing token treasuries as a substitute for traditional equity investments or employee stock options. “You have to pay progressively more of that stack as it declines in price and you become a forced seller at certain points,” Carter said. “A lot of these projects are going to face liquidity crises.”Nevertheless, Demirors gave Aion credit for making the disclosures. “They are trying to bring transparency and accountability to how they are spending money. That’s good,” she said.There are other risks as well. Regulators have forced some crypto startups to refund tokens to buyers, a task that would prove challenging for the Aion Foundation since Spoke said it only has records of accredited investors who participated in the private pre-sale before its public token sale.Looking ahead, the foundation is focused on amping up the platform’s utility.“Our grant and bounty program has been very active and focused heavily on tooling,” Spoke said, speaking to how it rewards external developers with Aion tokens for creating software tools for its platform. “Over time we should not be the most important member [of the Aion ecosystem].”UPDATE (December 6, 17:00 UTC): This article has been updated to clarify that part of the $23 million Aion raised last year was in fiat.Matt Spoke image via CoinDesk archive"

This enables clients who trade over the counter to use this index as a reliable benchmark for their trades or potential investment products,” said Thomas Kettner, managing director at MIVS.With the new addition, the firm said it now has a total of 24 digital asset indices.Gabor Gurbacs, director of digital asset strategies at VanEck and MVIS, said:“The index may pave the way for institutionally oriented products, such as ETFs as well as provide further tools to institutional investors to execute institutional size trades at transparent prices on the OTC markets.”Back in June, VanEck partnered with financial services company SolidX in an attempt to launch the first bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), planned for listing on the Cboe BZX Equities Exchange.However, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) delayed its decision in August. Later in September, the SEC said that it has begun proceedings to decide whether to approve the proposed ETF.Gurbacs told CoinDesk at the time that delay was entirely expected and that the company remained committed to bringing to market “a liquid, insured and appropriately regulated physical bitcoin ETF.”Van Eck image via Twitter"

But as attractive as it appears, the journey to setting up shop in Iran isn’t turning out to be a simple one.Bitcoin mining is, in effect, a kind of energy arbitrage. Miners make their money when the cost of producing coins – currently 12.5 bitcoins per transaction block, plus any fees they’ve accrued – is lower than the operation of the mine itself, including electricity.Nima Dehqan, a blockchain researcher at a Tehran-based crypto startup Areatak, told CoinDesk that the firm has been meeting with foreign investors that are looking to attempt just that by mining in Iran.“We have had investors visiting our farms from Spain, Ukraine, Armenia, France,” he said.Dehqan added that his firm has signed a deal with a Spanish investor to set up mining farms in Iran, a process that will consist of three phases.“First is sort of a just-to-make-sure testing phase, which is already in place. Second is building new infrastructures together, which somehow has already started, too. And the third will be gathering more investors from outside of Iran,” he explained.Dehqan said investors are attracted the cheap electricity, which, depending on the actual source of power, can usually go well below $0.01 per kilowatt-hour. And his firm can run facilities at different scales, from two-to-three-megawatts small farms, to higher amounts like 10 – 20 megawatts.He said while the electricity cost in Iran has always been relatively low, the recent significant devaluation of the Iranian rial – partially due to the recent sanctions by the U.S. government – has made the opportunities even more appealing.There’s even evidence to suggest miners in countries commonly seen as bitcoin mining powerhouses – China in particular – are looking at Iran for potential opportunities.Compared to the numbers cited by Dehqan, electricity provided by hydropower stations in China’s southwestern region usually costs around 0.15 yuan – or about $0.02 per kilowatt-hour – in the summer when water is abundant. When winter comes, the cost could go up to $0.04 per kilowatt-hour.It appears that some Chinese miners have already made the move. A startup based in Chengdu, China, told CoinDesk under the condition of anonymity for fear of government reprisal that it has already deployed 2,000 miners in Iran.“Iran has vast natural gas resources and thus the electricity cost can be as low as 0.04 yuan [$0.006] per kilowatt-hour. But Iran doesn’t really have any firm making miners. Now that secondhand miners are being sold cheaply in China, it’s a rather reasonable business decision. With electricity that cheap, you can generate profits in one to two months,” the company said in a statement.Javad Sedighi, a self-employed cryptocurrency miner in Iran, echoed that point, telling CoinDesk that local miners largely rely on the import of machines to the country.“[That’s] because there are no companies, like Bitmain, [shipping equipment] to Iran. In the past few months, there have been intermediary companies [being] established in Iran that carry out the import of the machines,” Sedighi said, adding:“I think this is done by people who have a lot of power and money. And it’s done secretly.”That kind of potential – particularly for very cheap power – has even caught the attention of notable Chinese bitcoin millionaires like Chandler Hongcai Guo. On Oct. 26, Guo posted a video on his Weibo account, telling a group of audience that there’s a huge opportunity in Iran where electricity cost can go well below $0.01 kilowatt-hour.“It’s suitable for hosting secondhand miners that are on the edge of shutting down in China and can make profits in one to two months,” he was recorded as saying, and asked interested miners to visit Iran to do their own due diligence.But in conversation with CoinDesk, Dehqan sought to temper the idea that miners are rushing into Iran en-masse since the methods by which foreign investors can set up mining facilities are anything but simple.The Chinese miner that has set up 2,000 machines said one major hurdle for outsiders is to get miners inside the country to begin with, let alone establishing partnerships with local farms.The company explained that, currently, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps – a branch of the country’s military – still has significant sway on the border. Simply put, they have the power to decide which shipments come in and which ones do not.“There’s the risk of miners being detained and confiscated at the border. While some logistic companies may have an insurance policy to cover the loss but you can only get compensated by fiat and miners will be gone,” the firm said, adding:“It’s still very risky. Even though we also try to act as an agent to help other miners go overseas, many of them remain hesitant.”Dehqan echoed that point and added it’s not so easy to import miners into Iran and some special shipping procedures are necessary.And it’s not just internal pressures like border security that are proving to be barriers to would-be investors. Indeed, there’s one particular figure – U.S. President Donald Trump – who has thrown some wrenches into the proverbial gears.As it stands, current U.S. sanctions have further deterred potential investors that have ties to the world’s largest economy. Guo, who owns a mansion in California, told CoinDesk via WeChat that while he agrees the opportunity is very attractive now that the bitcoin mining difficulty and the overall network hash rate have both dropped significantly, investors like him would not dare to become involved.“I didn’t go visit myself, considering that the U.S. has imposed the economic sanctions on Iran,” he said, alluding to recent news that the chief financial officer of Huawei was arrested in Canada for alleged involvement in sanctions fraud.“Most of the mining giants in China, or miner makers, do not dare to host their machines in Iran. This is the general situation. As attractive as the electricity over there might be, only miners at an individual or much smaller scale are shifting to Iran. Most people are still hesitant.” Guo said.On Aug. 6, the Trump administration announced it would re-impose sanctions on Iran starting from Aug. 7 after withdrawing from a nuclear agreement the U.S. government first entered in 2015. However, the European Union, Russia and China have been reportedly seeking to uphold the agreement to allow businesses and financial transactions to continue with Iran.According to Sedighi, cryptocurrency mining in Iran itself is still a legal grey area, which means that it’s neither entirely legal or illegal.“The rules of the mining industry in Iran have not been approved by Parliament. But it is in hand,” he said. “In Iran, like the rest of the industry, you do not have a license to operate. For example, you can not get a bank loan.”To that effect, Sedighi said the local crypto community is working together to push Iranian lawmakers to pass a formal law that would protect the mining industry, thus enabling it to attract capital and grow.“We believe that political disagreements between governments should not harm the people,” he said, concluding:“There have been very much talks about sanctions, as well as methods that should be used by the Iranian crypto society to avoid harming sanctions.”Tehran image via Kanisorn Pringthongfoo/Shutterstock"

The plaintiffs were seeking the return of their investments as the firm did not meet construction deadlines and then allegedly did not honor promises to refund contributions.Mining farm image via Shutterstock"

that makes micropayments feasible by keeping them off the blockchain, ...","Nov 23, 2018 at 08:30 UTC",Few projects have done as much to explore crypto micropayments as the year-old Yalls blog created by Lightning Labs developer Alex Bosworth.,"From April through early November, Bosworth said, blog participants have processed nearly 20,000 invoices with the Lightning Network, a bitcoin scaling solution that makes micropayments feasible by keeping them off the blockchain, sidestepping network transaction fees.It costs roughly one cent to read a Yalls article, half a cent to leave a comment on a post, and 10 cents to react to a post with an emoji. Publishing an article costs around 6 cents.“One nice thing about micropayments is that it brings back anonymity to the web,” Bosworth told CoinDesk. “I’m really a fan of the idea that your identity doesn’t have to be tied to a username and password.”Explaining that readers can tap into Yall’s Lightning node-and-channels system without a traditional subscription, like most paywalled outlets, he added:“Maybe you don’t even have a wallet yet … So you go to the Yalls app page, you can connect to it.”So far readers have opened more than 118 Lightning nodes through this platform, many of which are now facilitating payment channels, in which small amounts are sent back and forth between users before final settlement on the blockchain.This allowed contributors to post 170 new articles from July to early November 2018, while readers paid for 675 emoji reactions and 194 comments. Plus, writers have claimed their bite-sized crypto rewards at least 432 times during the same period, collecting the fees from readers for their articles.“It’s pennies, so every single invoice is small,” Bosworth said.As such, some node operators have been operating channels for several months, and according to Bosworth, earning roughly $5 a month on routing fees. While this hardly constitutes a business model for daily publishing, it highlights how engaged readership can contribute to a platform’s broader infrastructure.Speaking to how media outlets often find participatory ecosystems difficult to moderate, since trolls and marketers can flood comment sections at no cost, he added:“The micropayments help there, because then you don’t have robots or spam.”Since Bosworth created this blog as a hobby, with a corresponding Lightning node on-boarding process, he doesn’t regularly track readers or payments and provided the April-November data to CoinDesk on request. He hasn’t marketed the site or solicited contributions either. And yet, it’s clear that bitcoin fans are engaging.“In the beginning of the site there were problems keeping the node online. If the node died, you couldn’t read any articles or do anything on the site. I had to really babysit the node,” Bosworth said. “Over time, that feedback made its way back to LND [Lightning Network Daemon] and now the node is pretty stable.”On the other hand, Bosworth acknowledged it will take years for this type of community funding to work for professional media outlets.For starters, few people know how to operate a Lightning-friendly crypto wallet or node. General crypto-literacy is in short supply among mainstream audiences.Plus, syncing up wallets and nodes with the site itself takes time to develop in-house.According to Bosworth, readers were “pretty forgiving” when payments worth less than a penny had trouble processing. But “if you start to charge people like $20 a month or something, you have to provide a higher quality of service, that there’s never any bugs,” he said, adding that reliable infrastructure for one-click payments is the only way readers will use crypto micropayments for content on-the-go.“If the infrastructure were there, so that there were less mental costs on the user to make that payment,” he said, “I think it could take off.”Lightning image via Shutterstock"

Collectively referred to the RIF Open Standard or RIF OS, each protocol is intended to simplify and streamline the development of decentralized applications, or dapps, and encourage broader adoption of blockchain tech as a programming tool.Zaldivar told CoinDesk:“RIF Lab’s focus is on building technology that facilitates access to decentralized infrastructure enabling traditional developers, organizations, and innovators to bring to life the next generation of distributed applications.”While traditionally focused on tools that operate alongside bitcoin – think of it as porting ethereum’s functionality to the world’s largest blockchain by market cap – Zaldivar added that “all the software and intellectual property produced will be contributed to the community” as free, open-source code.The idea, he indicated, is to advance the use of the RIF OS protocols to other cryptocurrency platforms as well.As it stands, one of the five RIF OS protocols has been released – with the four other protocols to do with varying blockchain operations including payments, data feeds, storage and communication channels – to follow shortly.The one available now on the smart contract platform enables developers to do away with “complex blockchain address sharing,” as explained by Zaldivar, and replaces addresses with plain, user-friendly aliases for cryptocurrency and token accounts.Not disclosing any major funders to the launch of RIF OS protocols just yet, Zaldivar told CoinDesk:“I would say we are well funded to move forward … We don’t share the actual details but I would say we have funding for the next five to seven years of operations.”Correction:  All of the quotes in this article have been attributed to CEO of RIF Labs Diego Gutierrez Zaldivar, not RIF Labs head of marketing Gloria Vailati.  Building blocks image via Shutterstock "

Sprecher appeared with Kelly Loeffler, the CEO of Bakkt, the bitcoin futures platform backed by ICE that is gearing up for a planned launch early next year.Sprecher was responding to a question from moderator Michael J. Casey about the recent drop in bitcoin prices (as well as those around the wider cryptocurrency market). According to Loeffler, a focus on price isn’t really a factor for Bakkt, which in August unveiled its plan to create “an open and regulated, global ecosystem for digital assets,”“The price is being expressed but there’s a lot of missing infrastructure and use cases,” she remarked.The appearance by Loeffler and Sprecher – the latter of whom’s exchange operator giant is backing Bakkt – covered a range of topics, including the push to appeal to institutional investors, whether the firm is competing with crypto startup Coinbase, and the reasoning behind its announcement last week that it was pushing a previously-announced December launch window to late January.According to Loeffler, the delay was pursued in part because “the pipeline filled up with customers” following the August unveiling. She further positioned the move as a way to boost the chances of success by pushing the product launch past the holiday season.As for what Bakkt is aiming to achieve – apart from the launch of futures products as well as planned initiatives with companies like Starbucks to develop payment-focused use cases – Loefller highlighted the push for price discovery to occur in markets that are regulated at the federal level.“If you think about commodities or equity indices, the S&P500, that price is established in a federally regulated market, we don’t have that in the crypto market today. That’s what we’re focused on bringing along with a myriad of other features.” Loeffler explained.The panel ended on a question central to Bakkt’s launch: why it’s focusing on bitcoin initially. According to Sprecher, that’s because of the broader market’s acceptance of bitcoin as the top cryptocurrency.“Oftentimes in finance, it’s not about being the best; it turns out about being the broadest and the most commonly accepted,” he remarked, concluding:“And for whatever reason, bitcoin has sort of became that.”Photo by Stan Higgins for CoinDesk"

The combined value of the forked currency is lower than the pre-fork currency and the resulting confusion has been severely detrimental to the market overall.”When reached for comment, Powell noted that he had not yet seen the complaint, but asked, “Why would we change the ticker for bitcoin cash?”The defendants colluded to take control of bitcoin cash, the lawsuit claims. As such, UnitedCorp is looking for restitution and damages, along with legal fees.Going even further, the suit adds:“Plaintiff seeks an injunction: (a) precluding Amaury Sechet, Shammah Chancellor, and Jason Cox via Bitcoin ABC from continuing to implement checkpoints on the Bitcoin Cash network and any other implementation of the software that would prevent the resulting chains from being able to be re-merged; and (b) requiring them to return the blockchain to its previously decentralized form with the previous consensus rules.”Roger Ver, bitcoin.com, Bitmain, Jihan Wu and Shammah Chancellor did not respond to requests for comment by press time.

At the time, Judge Vince Chhabria stated that it was unclear what Berk’s legal basis was, what he believed Coinbase should have done or how the rollout could have gone more smoothly.As such, the amended complaint alleges that the rollout failed to abide by the token listing standards on GDAX (now Coinbase Pro). Further, while Coinbase said it would let investors know ahead of time when it would permit bitcoin cash withdrawals, it instead opened withdrawals without warning, the suit claims.When bitcoin cash was listed, only purchase orders were permitted on the platform, causing the price to spike, the plaintiffs allege.The plaintiffs are seeking damages and restitution, in an amount to be determined at trial, as well as the costs incurred during the course of the lawsuit.The document concludes by demanding a jury trial on the issues laid out.While the amended complaint was originally due within 21 days of the previous order – Nov. 13 – the plaintiffs and defendants agreed to an extension, allowing the plaintiffs to file the new document on Nov. 20.Moving forward, Coinbase must provide a response by Dec. 20, and while both parties will have an opportunity to file another response each, a hearing has been scheduled for Jan. 31, 2019.An attorney for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Coinbase declined to comment.Read the full amended complaint here:Second Amended Class Action… by on ScribdCoinbase CEO Brian Armstrong image via YouTube"

The futures contract became something nonsense, not something we could use to hedge,” Changhe was quoted as saying.Four other unnamed traders also reportedly said that they would reduce their exposure to OKEx or even stop dealing with the exchange entirely. One of the four has complained to the country’s financial watchdog, the Securities and Futures Commission, Bloomberg says.On Nov. 14, the day before the hard fork of the bitcoin cash blockchain, OKEx posted an announcement on its blog, giving short notice that all BCH futures would stop trading “at 9:05am and be delivered at 10:00am Nov 14, 2018 CET (UTC +1) due to the upcoming hard fork. We will provide a detailed explanation shortly.”In an announcement later the same day, it said it had opted to use the last traded prices as the delivery prices since there was no trading pair with bitcoin cash with “enough market depth and trading volume to compose an index for delivery.”Calling the pre-fork situation an “extremely special case,” OKEx continued:“It has come to our concern that an early announcement may make room for market manipulation and cause loss to our users. Therefore, we decided to give a short notice in order to maintain the fairness and stability of the market.”It also explained why it had chosen a delivery time one hour after the halt of trading, saying that to have both at the same time could have caused a flood of ask orders that “could have crushed the BCH spot market and caused huge volatility.”This is not the first time OKEx has made such a decision. Back in August, OKEx froze one of its users’ account and initiated a forced liquidation after the client made an “enormous” long position of 4,168,515 bitcoin futures contracts and declined the exchange’s request to lower the position.OKEx app image via Shutterstock "

So we will be looking at that,” he said.Jessop explained that Fidelity is taking a customer-driven approach for now and that its 13,000-plus institutional clients are interested in bitcoin and ether because they make up a large part of the current market cap.“I think when it comes to security tokens or tokens that are likely to be deemed securities, we are waiting for that space to develop,” he explained, going on to say:“We have had some interest but we don’t think it’s a groundswell of interest, so our focus is really on the top, call it five-seven, before we start building capabilities for the tail. But I think it will come.”Fidelity has spent four to five years of R&D in the space and has a long view of the crypto asset class and the underlying technology’s potential, which Jessop compared to the exponential sweep of the internet.He acknowledged that digital assets have not had a great run this year, pointing out that, a year prior, the run-up in prices saw Fidelity’s charitable crypto donations vehicle garner some $70 million in contributions.“It was a great story and a great source of donations,” Jessop added.Fidelity image via Shutterstock"

So their spam is only reaching BSV.”As a result of large transaction volume, the Bitcoin SV network temporarily suffered a mini-fork yesterday in which competing iterations of the blockchain caused computer servers – also called nodes – supporting the network to fall out of sync with one another. To re-align Bitcoin Cash SV nodes and converge the forked blocks into one chain again, certain blocks were reorganized.Block reorganizations – in short “reorgs” – occur as a result of the consensus protocol called proof-of-work (PoW) overseeing how transactions get validated on platforms such as bitcoin and bitcoin cash. Because PoW requires miners to expend large amounts of hash power – also understood simply as computation energy – in a race to append the next correct block in the chain, at times miners may propose new blocks at similar time intervals.When this happens, though miners usually announce to the entire network that a block has been found immediately, the number of transactions being included into the block and thereby the overall amount of data that must be transmitted throughout the network may be slow to propagate.This was the case yesterday when slow block propagation caused two blocks on the Bitcoin SV chain to be rewritten.Peter Rizun, chief scientist at Bitcoin Unlimited – a company producing a leading software implementation for bitcoin cash – told CoinDesk that according to his calculations, Bitcoin SV blocks are currently propagating at a rate of about “[five] seconds per megabyte.”“That is very slow … The probability that another block is found in [a] 100-second interval is … 15.3 percent. Normally, the probability of orphaning is below 1 percent,” said Rizun.The reason for this in part is due to the increase in block size from 32 MB to 128 MB on the Bitcoin SV blockchain.Though a greater number of transactions are able to be fit on a given block, the network – when overloaded with transactions – is unable to transmit data about newly issued blocks to all network participants and avoid competing iterations of what the last confirmed block of transactions was.Toomim explained that in short, “big blocks take longer to propagate.”Calling the situation an “orphan race” where blocks become abandoned or excluded from the main chain over time, Toomim added that the bottlenecks to block propagation on the network likely wouldn’t occur on the Bitcoin ABC chain due to the comparatively smaller block sizes seen on the network, in addition to other technical features that delay or ignore any transactions that cause the network undue stress.“If the same kind of test is done with Bitcoin ABC, Bitcoin ABC will have about the same throughput but because we have limits in place the excess transaction will be either delayed or ignored, usually delayed,” said Toomim.He elaborated that the “delaying of excessive transaction throughput” during stress test scenarios ensured that all nodes remain in consensus about what the most recent block is, ensure blocks are propagated more quickly to the network and as a whole allow “the entire network to operate more efficiently.”Not a new concern, the issue of scaling transaction volume on larger block sizes has been a well-known topic of discussion within the bitcoin cash community since as early as August.To this, Rizun told CoinDesk that “nothing that is happening is unexpected.”“[Craig Wright] and the SV people didn’t believe what the scientists and engineers were saying about the current scalability limitations, and now they are proving us right while the world is watching,” he added.Indeed, several spectators of the bitcoin cash split have called out the clear limitations to the Bitcoin SV network as a result of yesterday’s intentional transaction spam.Chris Pacia, lead developer for e-commerce platform OpenBazaar, warned that as a result of the block reorg “someone could have lost money if they received a payment and considered it final after two confirmations only to have the transaction be reversed.”He added that in his view:“The ABC side has been adamant in saying that the network cannot yet handle large blocks and the BSV side were being reckless pushing for a 128MB block size. So a two block reorg demonstrates pretty clearly that the ABC side was right.”Nevertheless, in the face of criticism, Wright maintains that flaws to network capacity on the Bitcoin SV chain are far from fatal, and instead encouraged businesses to begin operating on the network as normal.“Going forward we will start to open up and allow business use of the Bitcoin blockchain … In the coming years, we plan to support an unbounded blocksize and as many transactions as people are willing to send us,” wrote Wright in a Medium post (he refers to the Bitcoin Cash SV network as bitcoin).Speaking directly to the events of yesterday, Wright conceded on Twitter that there were “areas we need to improve” and affirmed that he was well aware of “what is needed.”In the same tweet, Wright promised that in six months’ time transaction capacity would increase to 2,500 transactions per second on the Bitcoin SV network.Image via Shutterstock"

It’s currently working through regulatory issues with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), they added.Back in February, the CFTC strengthened its review process for cryptocurrency futures products. Its new checklist pertaining to Designated Market Contracts and Derivatives Clearing Organizations was aimed to assist regulators as exchanges introduce new crypto products onto the market.The Nasdaq contracts are said to be based on bitcoin’s spot price on “numerous” exchanges, and will be compiled by New York-based investment management firm VanEck.Nasdaq was first revealed to be preparing to offer bitcoin futures products in November of last year.The very first bitcoin futures contracts hit the markets almost a year ago, with offerings from CBOE and CME Group arriving as bitcoin prices peaked to their all-time high near $20,000 in December.More recently, the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) announced it is launching a physically delivered bitcoin futures product through a new exchange called Bakkt. That launch was postponed from a December 2018 launch date to January 2019 due to the “volume of interest” in the company and the “work required to get all the pieces in place,” the firm said.Nasdaq image via Shutterstock "

Just as bitcoin and blockchain-based cryptocurrencies challenged our traditional views of money and its movements, ICOs should make us question three well-entrenched sectors: venture capital, public finance and entrepreneurship.That’s a tall order for a concept that is barely two years old in actual practice.For each of these three sectors, ICOs have encountered the headwinds of change, but the most critical friction comes from regulators. If regulators continue to perceive ICOs as nothing more than a securities offering, that stance poses a real threat to the emancipation of the ICO market. The emancipation that is needed is not so much of the quantitative kind (number of ICOs and amounts raised), but rather of the qualitative nature (i.e. reflecting innovative uses of tokens that empower companies to embed them into their business models).A few months ago, via a speech by one of its commissioners, the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) gave a sliver of hope to the viability of tokens. When the network on which the functioning token or coin is sufficiently decentralized, the SEC said the underlying token is not a security, because the existing U.S. Securities Act regime adds little value, due to the lack of central actors.But there is no point rejoicing about that statement because the SEC offered no path to get to that stage, other than to start creating tokens as a security.To date, the SEC has publicly recognized only two such tokens as not securities: bitcoin and ethereum. While this was a positive development, it leaves a huge cloud of doubt and uncertainty over the many other bonafide tokens that deserve a similar acknowledgement.Realistically, decentralization alone is not a sufficient checkmark for a laissez-faire regulatory attitude. Heeding the SEC position, some token issuers have been going out of their way to lower their “central actor” role in order to remain in that classification box. The sad part of that direction is that prematurely decentralizing governance can actually hurt proper management of a given technology more than benefit it. Projects that are still in the development stages can become disjointed and lose progress efficiency when they are not centrally managed.Actual token usage by real users is arguably more pertinent to labelling the role of a token as a non-security, whether the governance is central or not. It is the network’s decentralization aspect itself that is the primordial factor, so why cripple those who are attempting to implement decentralization too early?Every token is inherently a currency of sorts, or a right to some action.It can be earned via mining a network, validating a transaction, or doing some human work, or sharing data, and it can be spent accordingly in return for a variety of services, both of technical and non-technical natures. A token is therefore effectively a medium of exchange for services between consumers and developers alike.What is at stake here? Nothing less than the role of the token as a key innovative model for the blockchain economy.The token as a decentralized utility is essentially needed, but not all tokens can be born as a security. It would be disastrous to the blockchain industry if we labelled utility tokens as securities when the primary ownership intent is one of usage, not profits. Labeling a token as a security at birth or even during the development and product-to-market fit evolutions restricts their movements, especially the efforts of putting them in the hands of consumers and developers who want to use them.That can kill innovation that is begging to experiment with token functionality.Going the securities route to escape regulatory scrutiny is like hiding under a rock. Yes, you can be regulatory compliant but your token still needs to prove its utility, gain adoption and have a defensible business model. If you don’t, users who followed you can still lose a lot of money. So, complying is not a bullet-proof way to consumer protection.There can be numerous approaches for consumer protection, only if there is a willingness to be open minded and patient enough to let the models bear their fruit. Innovation is restricted when it is boxed within the same set of regulatory confines that were devised many technology generations ago. Just as the Securities Act adapted to online trading, it must adapt and bend to accept the realities of the blockchain’s new paradigm.An ICO is only the beginning of the journey, and not an exploit in of itself. Reaching the right token-to-market fit stage takes time, just as product-to-market fit iterations take time to perfect in tech startups.Birthing an alternative funding system is complicated and takes some iterations including practice dances and mis-steps with regulators. Maybe the first generation of ICOs can be iterated upon, but ICOs 2.0 want a fair chance for success.The elephant in the room are the regulators, and that room is full of china today. They could wreak havoc in it, or they can allow it to prosper by staying outside the room, monitoring results and inflows, while not getting involved in the sausage-making itself as long as what comes out is valuable, innovative, lawful, ethical and real.If all tokens were labelled as securities, then consumers could not easily use them, and that would be a tragedy. This is an existential position for the future of the ICO and it is intricately tied to the classification of tokens as a new asset class due to its inherently new properties.Granted, we don’t have so many examples of tokens being used as a widespread utility, but once we do, we will look back and be astonished that we were fighting the trend.I am optimistic that the long-term prospects of cryptocurrency in the U.S. are good, but the short-to-medium term may not be. Let us not erect so many bumps along that road.I predict that 2019 will be the year where, at least in the U.S., the SEC and the blockchain industry will come head to head. The industry will challenge the SEC’s ultra-conservative stance on the looseness of their interpretation of the Securities Act as far as applying them to good ICOs and token use cases.The regulators could end-up governing the future of ICOs if they keep their old lenses, but we shouldn’t let them. Regulators are supposed to be reactive to innovation and not stifle it before it is born. They are supposed to follow the market, not preempt it with early shots.Let us hope that entrepreneurs and the industry they represent are the ones leading by example, and showing the way to the future of ICOs and the innovative token models they engender.Have a strong take on 2018? Email news [at] coindesk.com to submit an opinion to our Year in Review.Time image via Shutterstock"

The platform currently supports dozens of decentralized applications (dapps), with the leading application Graphite Docs garnering over 4,000 users.“It was a self-imposed thing we did for investor protection,” Blockstack co-founder Muneeb Ali told CoinDesk about the unusual choice to lock up its capital. “We, in general, have been pretty lean. We’re still less than 25 people. We definitely won’t be hiring very aggressively over the next year but [market volatility] won’t change our plans that much.”Ali said the startup has an extended runway because Blockstack held roughly 70 percent of its capital in fiat. Plus, the 30 percent of its funds that Blockstack holds in bitcoin and ether aren’t intended to cover operating costs.“Crypto would be the last thing we’d use,” Ali said, adding that a lock-up procedure was also applied to Blockstack’s native token so that token holders could only access their crypto a full year after the original purchase. (The tokens can be used to pay fees for services on the Blockstack network, as can bitcoin.)He added:“There isn’t a lot of liquidity in our system and it was designed that way. We wanted to attract parties that believe in the long-term success of the ecosystem and contribute to building it.”Ali said that, thanks to the lockup, the company has so far spent less than 20 percent of its capital raise. Only a small amount of the available 20 percent from the raise was spent so far on development costs and a few small grants to help kick-start community contributions. The next portion of the 2017 round, roughly $10 million, will only be unlocked when the Blockstack platform supports 1 million users.Setting conditions for these funds helped keep the startup’s spending from outpacing traction.“We’re at the end of the infrastructure phase,” Ali said. “We want to optimize our apps so that their usability is as good as traditional web applications or cloud applications.”Compared to projects such as the Aion Foundation and Civil, which have partially compensated participants with tokens or the promise of future tokens, Blockstack has been conservative about rolling out community incentives.Patrick Stanley, head of growth at Blockstack, told CoinDesk the startup is waiting for regulatory clarity before it offers token rewards for developer contributions.In the meantime, it’s leaving the task of evaluating contributions to partners like Democracy Earth, a blockchain governance startup that helps rank and evaluate Blockstack applications and runs elections where token holders can vote on which applications receive portions of a monthly bitcoin grant from Blockstack, worth $100,000 in total.“If you’re contributing labor and value to the network, you should be compensated for that,” Stanley told CoinDesk, referring to how apps build value for users. That value is then evaluated by partners like Democracy Earth that act as market oracles, measuring sentiment and activity.“We’ll continue to add oracles so that it would be very difficult for apps and app reviewers to game the system,” he said.In the long run, Stanley added, Blockstack aims to increase the role community members play in token distribution, so that the startup isn’t a centralized source of rewards.So far, this unique approach to rewarding apps with tangible traction is itself attracting curious technologists. Stanley said 2,000 people attended Blockstack meetups throughout 2018.Ali said:“You want to attract people that don’t even care about cryptocurrency. They are coming for different types of utility.”Unlike many token projects, Blockstack is not relying on its native cryptocurrency to fuel its business model or attract new community members.Justin Hunter, founder of the Graphite Docs app that lets users create and share files without a third-party like the centralized alternative Google Docs, told CoinDesk his users are looking for “cloud convenience with none of the privacy trade-off.”Hunter doesn’t own any Blockstack tokens yet, although he might someday. At the moment, he’s more focused on collaborating with the Blockstack app developers behind Stealthy and Blockusign to add privacy features and the ability to sign contracts. Improved user experience is motivation enough, no token economics required.“Collaboration between apps on Blockstack’s platform is still largely a matter of the app developers working together and writing custom code,” Hunter said. “Unlike other decentralized development platforms, Blockstack doesn’t use their token to drive development.”Hunter agreed with Ali that the crypto market slump hasn’t had any impact on user acquisition or strategy. In fact, Ali said Blockstack itself may raise more traditional venture capital in the future so that the team can focus on building a valuable ecosystem before prioritizing monetization or liquidity.“There is room for doing a Series B or Series C,” Ali said hypothetically, adding that isn’t currently the plan. “We’re years and years away until business models become pressing for us. ”Muneeb Ali image via CoinDesk Consensus archive"

Mayweather will pay $300,000 in disgorgement, $300,000 in penalties and $14,775 in prejudgment interest. Khaled will pay $50,000 in disgorgement, $100,000 in penalties and $2,725 in prejudgment interest.Further, the two are banned from promoting “any securities, digital or otherwise,” for the next few years; Mayweather has agreed to a three-year ban, while Khaled’s ban will last for a period of two years.The SEC added that Mayweather will continue to cooperate with its investigation, which is ongoing.The move comes more than a year after the agency first warned celebrities that it may be against the law to promote investment products if they “do not disclose the nature, source and amount of compensation paid … in exchange for the endorsement.”SEC emblem image via Shutterstock"

It’s notable that this state of affairs came to fruition during what has historically proven to be a bullish month for bitcoin.As CoinDesk previously reported, the month of November has concluded with a monthly gain for BTC seven times since pricing data was first collected in 2010, but its current monthly performance of -24 percent is heavily stacking the odds in favor of this November proving to be an exception to the 8-year trend.BTC’s recent plummet tells only half the story of a much larger cryptocurrency market sell-off, although its plunge below $6,200 on Nov. 14 was likely the spark to the powder keg that was the broader market. From Nov. 14 to today, the cryptocurrency market has shed $50 billion and a whopping 23 percent from its total capitalization to where it stands now at $162 billion – a far cry from its all-time high north of $820 billion set this past January, according to CoinMarketCap. What perhaps best depicts the extent of the market rout is the performance of the world’s 10 largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization over the past seven days.if(""undefined""==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper[""cN54T""]={},window.datawrapper[""cN54T""].embedDeltas={""100"":464,""200"":414,""300"":389,""400"":389,""500"":364,""700"":364,""800"":364,""900"":364,""1000"":364},window.datawrapper[""cN54T""].iframe=document.getElementById(""datawrapper-chart-cN54T""),window.datawrapper[""cN54T""].iframe.style.height=window.datawrapper[""cN54T""].embedDeltas[Math.min(1e3,Math.max(100*Math.floor(window.datawrapper[""cN54T""].iframe.offsetWidth/100),100))]+""px"",window.addEventListener(""message"",function(a){if(""undefined""!=typeof a.data[""datawrapper-height""])for(var b in a.data[""datawrapper-height""])if(""cN54T""==b)window.datawrapper[""cN54T""].iframe.style.height=a.data[""datawrapper-height""][b]+""px""});(BitcoinCash (BCH) was not included due to hard fork experienced on Nov. 15)As can be seen in the above graph, all ten cryptocurrencies are reporting negative price developments against the US dollar while eight of the 10 are reporting seven-day losses above 24 percent.XRP is notably outperforming BTC and the broader market, down only 5 percent in that last seven days, and just 2.3 percent today – and yet is up over 20 percent against BTC in the past seven days.In the past 24 hours, the world’s 10th largest cryptocurrency, monero (XMR), is the worst performer of the top 10, down over 17 percent in that span while Metaverse ETP (ETP) is the worst performer out of the top 100, down over 37 percent, according to data from CoinMarketCap.It’s worth noting that significant drops like the one experienced today and for much of 2018 are not new to the cryptocurrency market. In 2013, the price of BTC rose to an all-time high of $1163 only to fall below $160 less than a year later. Also at that time, litecoin (LTC), the world’s seventh largest cryptocurrency today, fell from $50 to just above $1. Now-famously, they rose to the north of $19,000 and $320, respectively, only to quickly return much of the gains over the course of this past year.Traders and investors alike are now likely waiting for the market to bottom out in what’s known as capitulation, whereby market participants surrender completely and forfeit demand. At such a point in time when a bottom is formed, fear in the market is at its absolute peak, accompanied by falling sell volume that is slowly outpaced by rising buy volume.Although its now certainly painful for market participants, it remains to be seen if a bottom will be reached any time soon.Disclosure: The author holds BTC, AST, REQ, OMG, FUEL, 1st and AMP at the time of writing.dominoes image via Shutterstock"

world, ...","Dec 3, 2018 at 09:00 UTC",Michael J. Casey is the chairman of CoinDesk’s advisory board and a senior advisor for blockchain research at MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative.,"The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers.————I have a friend who has made a significant fortune out of bitcoin. He is one of those enthusiasts who happily hands out the cryptocurrency to others in the interest of spreading adoption.All of that is good. However, one thing has always infuriated me: his boasts, especially last year, that he was spreading belief in bitcoin because the small amount he’d distributed to random people over the years was now worth X times more in dollar terms. He loved it, he said, when they’d call to thank him.Why on earth would I have an issue with this generosity of spirit? Because it perpetuated a narrative that speculative gains, measured in fiat currency terms, was bitcoin’s core value proposition for the world.Implicitly, the story my friend told to these people was not that, as a model for censorship-resistant, disintermediated money, bitcoin has the potential to enable peer-to-peer exchange without rent-seeking financial institutions dictating the terms.Nor was it that we now have the makings of digital cash, a means of transferring value from anyone anywhere to anyone anywhere that doesn’t require a bank account or the approval of some authority.The underlying message was not that bitcoin is the first digital asset, a representation of value that can live on the Internet without risk of replication or counterfeiting. Neither was it that we now have an ostensibly immutable, consensus-based record-keeping system, the first in history that cannot be changed by someone in power.No, his story was quite simply that if you hang onto this thing – never mind understanding it – you too can get rich like me.My friend is not alone, of course. Last year, as an insane market bubble, not only in bitcoin but also in countless other crypto assets, fostered a collective mania around the world, the “to the moon” language and “when Lambo?” mindset permeated everything. It even found its way into the mainstream public.I’ll never forget a relative who’d paid no attention to crypto beforehand asking me what coin she should buy. After warning her that she really shouldn’t do this, I nonetheless started explaining why I had an intellectual, non-investor interest in ASIC-resistant coins. She replied, “I don’t understand any of that, just tell me what to buy.”This mania was the making of crypto enthusiasts everywhere. They fostered a blind faith in the Midas touch of their industry. Remember, this was a time when an iced tea producer’s executives briefly showed that they could produce a miraculous share price increase simply by adding the word “blockchain” to the corporate name.For a community that likes to declare that you can trust crypto because, unlike fiat money, it’s backed, not by wishy-washy people, but by rock-solid math, this encouragement of magical thinking was pretty hypocritical. Now that the bubble has well and truly burst, it is time to banish the voodoo mentality.Some view cryptocurrency solely as a tool of the rich, as a way for the privileged few to keep their property away from the prying hands of the state. If I eventually discover that they’re right, that that’s all it can be, I’ll quit.For now, though, I still see this technology as a tool of the people, and therefore believe it can only succeed with mass adoption. I don’t care how it gets there – whether by widespread retail usage or by the back-office use of public blockchain architectures to foster a new, decentralized economy – the goal must be to positively impact lives everywhere.Sadly, I think we’ve set that objective back drastically. We’ve managed to do great harm to the public’s acceptance of and trust in the technology. It’s not irreparable, but it’s fair to say we have a problem when the mainstream now equates crypto with bubbles, scams and losses.To be sure, this price correction might yet imitate that which followed the late-2013 bubble – a two-year hiatus followed by a revival rally in 2016 that took us to ever higher highs in 2017. But the risk is that the 2018 downturn has produced more lasting damage to public confidence than that of 2014. This time it was the Regular Joes who lost their shirts, not the basement-dwelling bitcoin mining hobbyists.The blow to confidence is so great that I now regret writing last year that the surge of mainstream interest in crypto was constructive. I’d argued that although many people would lose a lot of money, the surge of buying had sparked a curiosity among a much wider group of people, such that a host of new ventures would be launched by these newcomers. These were the people, I argued, who would build the decentralized economy of the future.Now, while I’m encouraged to find that many of newly activated innovators are still at it, I don’t think I fairly accounted for the lasting societal effect of so many others losing their shirts.The angry posts that someone with the Twitter handle @CandleHater compiled into this useful thread are, quite likely, representative of the masses’ feelings.  Bitcoin is now down roughly 75% from its highs, ether is off about 90% and the overall token market capitalization is 80% lower. Such a brutal meltdown will do great damage to confidence in the sector.What are the consequences of that loss of confidence?It means that a hardline critic like Nouriel Roubini is now, in people’s minds, legitimized, regardless of his simplistic, static view of the technology’s ongoing development.And it means that government regulators, whose obligations are to those same mainstream constituents, will take a more wary view of the technology and, quite likely, a harder line in regulating it. For crypto startups, this will further exclude them from markets, make it even harder to get bank accounts and impose even greater compliance burdens on them.The good news is that the glare of public opinion will eventually dissipate and that as the spotlight diminishes, real developers will find themselves in a healthier environment within which to do the work needed to unlock this technology’s potential. We saw a similar period of constructive building during the 2014-2016 hiatus.But whatever new products are produced, they will now have a harder time struggling with acceptance. Whether we like it or not, message and image are important.Sadly, the Crypto Winter is here. If we are to extract ourselves from it there needs to be more than a sleeves-rolled-up commitment to technical development. The leaders of the community – those of us who have a mouthpiece in social media and elsewhere – also have an obligation to change the message.The message must be one of education. It must openly address the technology’s cons along with its pros, as well as the formidable obstacles it faces in terms of scaling, efficiency and security.Let’s quit this ugly obsession with price. After all, it simply validates the notion that the benchmark that matters is not bitcoin or some other cryptocurrency but the U.S. dollar.We made this mess. It’s up to us to clean it up.Winter image via Shutterstock"

What it is, is part of the commodity complex.”“I think cryptocurrencies will exist and will become more and more widespread, but they will be part of an ecosystem,” he went on to remark. “They will not be dominant as a lot of the early adopters believe they will be.”Speaking to why cryptocurrencies have appeal, El-Erian drew on the late-2000s global financial crisis that paved the way for bitcoin’s creation, highlighting the “loss of trust” in the decade since.“Yes, we have a big trust deficit,” El-Erian remarked, going on to add:“I don’t think we’d be up here on stage today if there had there not been a shock to the trust in the way the economy works.”During the session, moderated by New York Times columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin, El-Erian also spoke about his view on the question of institutional investor interest in the industry, commenting that “certainly there’s a lot more interest on the institutional side.”That focus led to a question about comments like those issued in the past by billionaire investor Warren Buffett, who said in May 2018 that bitcoin is “probably rat poison squared.”El-Erian framed remarks like that as a response to a rapidly escalating price, saying that “when people saw it was going straight up and saw who was getting sucked into this phenomenon, they started warning. And I do think those were appropriate warnings.”El-Erian went on to reiterate his belief that cryptocurrencies are here to stay.“I do believe this is not, you know, going to disappear. It’s just finding its place in the ecosystem.”Photo by Stan Higgins for CoinDesk"

This bill will provide data on how Congress can best mitigate these risks while propelling development that benefits our economy.”Several U.S. Representatives have been pushing for crypto and blockchain related bills since as early as 2014, when Congressman Steve Stockman of Texas was planning to introduce an act that would tax bitcoins as currency instead of property.Most recently, a bipartisan bill was introduced that proposed creating a “consensus-based definition of blockchain” in October. While in September, lawmakers announced three bills, addressing blockchain development, miners’ status and cryptocurrency-related taxes.Also in September, a group of lawmakers, including congressman Budd and Soto, asked Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chairman Jay Clayton to clarify when initial coin offerings (ICOs) are considered sales of securities.U.S. House of Representatives image via Shutterstock "

Accounts and debit cards are free, though it charges a one-percent transaction fee for trading bitcoin.Euro deposits of up to €100,000 (or $113,257) are protected by local laws like any other traditional bank accounts in Germany, the firm added.Jan Goslicki, Bitwala’s chief compliance officer and co-founder, said:“We were able to bring cryptocurrencies into a fully compliant banking setup regulated in Germany. This shows that cryptocurrencies can fit into regulatory frameworks which protect consumers and ultimately inspire trust.”The firm said it has started on-boarding 40,000 customers who pre-registered for the service and will be accepting new users with immediate effect.Customers will also be able to use their Bitwala crypto accounts to receive salaries, pay rent and trade bitcoin, according to Bitwala’s chief financial officer Christoph Iwaniez.The crypto banking service was first scheduled to launch last month after Bitwala announced the SolarisBank partnership back in October. The startup said at the time that it hoped to launch its own bank one day and was planning to apply for a German banking license next year.Bitwala raised $4.5 million in September from venture capital firms Earlybird and Coparion to develop its banking services.Back in June, Goldman Sachs-backed crypto startup Circle was also seeking to register as a federally licensed bank in the U.S.Bitcoin and euro image via Shutterstock "

Casey is the chairman of CoinDesk’s advisory board and a senior advisor for blockchain research at MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative.,"The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers.——-You may not have heard of Vertcoin, a crypto project designed to curtail concentration in mining power in the interests of broad-based participation. But if you care about security, decentralization and open access for cryptocurrencies, then the questions raised by a recent breach of its blockchain will matter to you.In a textbook 51 percent attack documented in a blog post by Coinbase security engineer Mark Nesbitt, someone seized majority control of the Vertcoin network’s hashing power to conduct multiple “reorgs” of the blockchain. The attacker essentially rewrote part of the ledger’s history and then, using their dominant hashing power to produce the longest chain, convinced the rest of the miners to validate this new version of the blockchain. With that, he or she could commit the ultimate crypto crime: a double-spend of prior transactions, leaving earlier payees holding invalidated coins.It was a painful blow for Vertcoin’s passionate community of users. Led by a dedicated, decentralized team of developers – the antithesis of last year’s money-grabbing ICO issuers – for four years they have defended their “ASIC-resistant” algorithm as a way to avoid the industrialized concentration of bitcoin and other proof-of-work cryptocurrencies.Now, the bear market in cryptocurrencies has posed them with a challenging question: was their constant commitment to maintaining the competitiveness of affordable, general-purpose mining equipment worth it? Is their otherwise laudable goal of democratized mining only creating an untenable security risk?Not surprisingly, critics, including many bitcoin maximalists, see the affair as a nail in the coffin for Vertcoin and other such projects. These ASIC-resistant projects’ algorithms are designed to ensure that powerful rigs running expensive, uniquely designed application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) have no advantage over those with graphics cards, or GPUs, a widely available, more affordable processing unit that can also be used for gaming consoles and other purposes.The problem, these critics say, is that if mining is relatively cheap and can be employed by simply taking a machine that’s currently doing one thing and having it do a different task, it’s easy for an attacker to deploy enough hashing power to seize control of the network. As a Breaker Mag headline declared, “Vertcoin’s greatest strength” seems now to be “a fatal flaw.”Yet there’s still no slam-dunk argument in favor of ASIC-dominated cryptocurrencies.By any measure, concentrated, ASIC-led mining power has fostered centralization around a few big players, which not only raises the risk of 51 percent attacks by any of those large operators on their own or in collusion but also puts them in a role as de facto gatekeepers. That violates the anti-middleman objectives of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology generally.Look at how Bitmain has, with varying success, periodically used its position as the dominant provider of bitcoin mining hardware to manipulate the market and force its interests on the wider community. While it’s true that Bitmain has at times been thwarted by its opponents, notably by developers who successfully introduced the Segregated Witness (SegWit) update to bitcoin’s code against its wishes, there’s an argument that this only put users at the mercy of a different kind of gatekeeper group: the Bitcoin Core developers.The arms race unleashed by ASIC-based competition for block rewards has also resulted in massive energy consumption in proof-of-work cryptocurrencies. While I believe bitcoin’s threat to the planet is way overblown and am encouraged by a recent Coinshares calculation that 77.6 percent of bitcoin mining uses renewable power, there’s no denying that electricity usage remains both an environmental challenge and a serious public relations problem for this industry.What’s more, it’s not clear that ASIC mining models are immune from the root cause of Vertcoin’s problems. Essentially, falling coin prices made mining less profitable and resulted in lower rental rates for already-installed hardware on cloud mining sites such as Nicehash. It was that rented capacity, not newly deployed machines, that gave the attacker a quick, low-cost route to amassing hashing power.All cryptocurrencies, both ASIC-resistant and ASIC-allowing versions, have seen their mining rental rates fall as crypto asset markets have collapsed. That has put a big pool of installed ASIC capacity at attackers’ disposal, undermining the argument that ASIC coins are protected because their rigs are more expensive to acquire and deploy than general-purpose GPUs.It’s true that if there’s not enough rented hashing power to reach 51 percent, then an attacker will face a bigger barrier if they must deploy new ASICs to get there. But if the attacker is already a large-scale ASIC miner, that’s not necessarily a big leap, either.Some developers are seeing the Vertcoin experience as a warning for all cryptocurrencies, viewing this bear market, which is playing havoc with mining profitability, as an all-encompassing threat to consensus models.Even before the worst of the downturn, 51 percent attacks seemed to be becoming more common. In comments to a Twitter thread he started regarding Nesbitt’s blog post, zcash developer Zooko Wilcox suggested the threat was quite wide indeed:To be sure, bitcoin appears to be significantly less vulnerable than other coins, because its massive overall hashing power, though itself down sharply since early October, makes it extremely expensive to rent enough of that power to take over the network.In contrast with a mere $131 per hour cost for a 51 percent attack on Vertcoin as of Friday, a bitcoin attack would have cost you $226,000 per hour, according to the website Crypto51. And that doesn’t take into account the fact that the current list of cloud mining providers could never deliver enough hashing power for a renter to grab majority control of the network.Also, if bottom-fishers eventually stabilize bitcoin’s price, which is now down more than 80 percent over the past 12 months, it will allow the protocol’s in-built difficulty adjustment to catch up and start to restore mining profitability.Still, this case for bitcoin’s superior security stems from its status as the dominant coin, not from the presence of ASICs per se. And it unreasonably assumes no further improvements in the various models aimed at achieving alternative consensus and governance models.We are by no means in stasis. Developers, within both altcoin and bitcoin communities, continue to explore decentralizing solutions. And for very good reason: the purpose of this technology has always been to achieve peer-to-peer exchange with broad, permissionless access that no gatekeeper can control.The way the Vertcoin community has approached that objective deserves recognition. It combines an anti-ASIC algorithm with a clear, community-wide pact to fork the code whenever an ASIC chip is designed to mine its coin.The model brings together two design elements that are critical for this technology’s success: smart on-chain cryptography with a clear off-chain social governance structure. (Disclosure: two of the main developers at Vertcoin, James Lovejoy and Gert-Jaap Glasbergen, are researchers at the MIT Digital Currency Initiative, where I am a senior advisor.)Still, this latest attack is a reminder that this cat-and-mouse game between the community and prospective attackers is really difficult to manage. The recent incursion into the Vertcoin network by specially designed Vertcoin ASICs showed how hard it is to keep up with the threat being amassed against it.But in the spirit of learning from failure, Vertcoin’s developers are now making fixes that will improve their cryptocurrency’s security. One protocol update will make the new Vertcoin ASICs uncompetitive, for example.It isn’t clear whether these are enough to offset the loss of confidence among Vertcoin investors and exchanges, which were the biggest losers in the double-spend attack. Vertcoin’s price has been hammered. From a peak of $10 in January, it was near $0.24 on Friday. And it is down 64 percent since the beginning of November alone. It may never recover from the blow to its reputation.But what Vertcoin developers are trying to achieve is important. It would be a mistake to dismiss their work based on this latest development.Whether this cryptocurrency itself survives or the learnings that come from it are applied to some other project, work on models that encourage open access and decentralization should be allowed to continue.Bitcoin mining facility image via CoinDesk archives."

In other words, the vendor (in this case OsiaNetwork) would be contributing alongside the miners.The opinion went on to note that any contributions OsiaNetwork makes to a political campaign in excess of what individuals contributed through providing computing power should be treated as donations through a partnership under existing law.The FEC’s commissioners will vote on the opinion on Dec. 19, 2018.Legal counsel for OsiaNetwork LLC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.FEC image via Mark Van Scyoc / Shutterstock"

That was around the time his small, ...","Dec 1, 2018 at 12:00 UTC",It’s been a long journey for Alan Lane since the Silvergate Bank CEO bought his first bitcoin in 2013.,"That was around the time his small, deposit-hungry bank, based in La Jolla, California, took on its first crypto exchange as a client. It was a gutsy move for a financial institution, since at the time most bankers viewed bitcoin as either a fad, a scam or a reputational risk – if they had even heard of it all.Speaking Friday at the BlockFS conference in New York, Lane recalled:“Here were these companies that were raising money from reputable [venture capital] firms. They weren’t doing anything illegal, they weren’t doing anything immoral. And yet, they were struggling to maintain bank accounts. So I put our need for deposits together with their need for banking services.”Five years later, Silvergate is arguably the leading bank for crypto startups in the U.S. Prominent exchange clients include Coinbase, Gemini, Kraken, and bitFlyer. And as revealed in the bank’s initial public offering prospectus, filed earlier this month, the bank now works with 483 crypto startups that contributed roughly $1.7 billion in deposits to the balance sheet as of Q3 2018.To overcome the crypto-phobia that to this day has held back most of Silvergate’s peers from serving the sector, Silvergate invited exchange executives to meet directly with the bank’s regulators, Lane said during a panel discussion on banking bitcoin startups.Even in the early days, he said, he was only interested in working with startups that had professionals with legal expertise from the traditional financial world and were wholly dedicated to the nitty-gritty of daily monitoring for ironclad compliance.At the time, most crypto startups had executives juggling diverse responsibilities, which was not going to cut it for a bank or its regulators. “The chief compliance officer is not a multiple-hat type of person,” Lane said.During the same panel, Nick Rosenberg, director of IT at the Metropolitan Bank in New York, said his institution – one of the very few to compete with Silvergate in the space – is aggressively pursuing a diverse range of crypto startups.But Lane said Silvergate has narrowed its focus over the years to almost exclusively serve exchanges, over-the-counter trading desks, and institutional investors.In reference to both Silvergate and Metro sharing Coinbase as a mutual client, Lane said:“Coinbase is probably the most well-banked company in the ecosystem. Coinbase probably banks with us and every other bank doing this on purpose.”Lane said this may be the remnant of a popular strategy from the early days, when crypto companies developed relationships with multiple banks in case one gets shut down.To distinguish itself from a client’s other banks, Silvergate integrates with exchange platforms’ APIs so that institutional investors with Silvergate accounts can instantly make trades or deposits 24/7, even if the bank is closed.This also offers some peace of mind for those investors that they’ll be able to get their money out, in fiat form, in a hurry.“That’s equally powerful on the way out, on the off-ramp,” Lane said. “Because we’ve all heard of exchanges being hacked.”The availability of data from a public ledger has helped Silvergate to get comfortable serving a sector long associated in the public mind, rightly or wrongly, with nefarious activities.In the early days, Silvergate set up a process for ongoing monitoring that matched up deposits with bitcoin blockchain data. Up until today, Lane said his staff might make quarterly visits to exchange offices to make sure they have the most up-to-date monitoring tools across blockchain-based assets, in addition to daily monitoring and routine communications.“We wanted to be able to see both sides of that [bitcoin] transaction,” Lane said. “When you wire $50,000, send us the blockchain address…what we want to see on the blockchain is a transaction that matches up with that $50,000 value.”Silvergate often applies the same meticulous approach in requiring its clients’ use external auditors for assets like dollar-pegged stablecoins – which Gemini and Coinbase have both launched in this year – to make sure fiat deposits match up with exchange records.Although Lane said he originally scoffed at the phenomenon of cryptocurrencies designed to hold their value with fiat, his bank is now “looking into stablecoins” to learn more.Speaking to why Silvergate is slow and selective when onboarding new crypto clients, he concluded:“It’s really important that it’s done right because if we have something illegal that goes across our platform, it could be detrimental to our business and to the integrity of the system. So we’re very protective of what we built.”Alan Lane (right) speaking at Block FS image via CoinDesk archives"

Goldman Sachs-backed crypto finance firm Circle also has an OTC desk called Circle Trade, available for both individual and institutional investors with a minimum ticket size of $250,00.And, back in April, U.S. cryptocurrency exchange Gemini, founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, unveiled block trading in bitcoin and ether, which allows customers to make high-volume trades that won’t appear in the exchange’s order book until they’ve been filled.Bitcoin and dollars image via Shutterstock "

Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Dec 13, 2018 at 17:53 UTC","Basis, the most well-funded stablecoin startup, has confirmed that it is shutting down and returning all of its remaining funds to investors.","The company realized that the regulatory landscape was too unfavorable to launch the project, according to an interview published today in Forbes. The startup’s move to return funds to investors was first reported by crypto news site The Block.Originally called Basecoin, Basis had secured $133 million in funding to build an algorithmic stablecoin. Its founder, Nader Al-Naji, frequently described the project using code to maintain price stability for its token in the same way the U.S. Federal Reserve does for the dollar.In a blog post today, Al-Naji wrote:“As regulatory guidance started to trickle out over time, our lawyers came to a consensus that there would be no way to avoid securities status for bond and share tokens (though Basis would likely be free of this characterization).”“We considered many alternative paths to launch to try and comply with the regulatory constraints while keeping our product compelling and competitive, including launching offshore, and starting off with a centralized stability mechanism,” Al-Naji explained in the post. “Ultimately, however, we don’t think any of the paths we considered are compelling enough for our users or our investors, or consistent enough with our vision to justify moving forward.”In particular, he noted that its bond and share tokens, used to expand and contract the supply of tokens in order to maintain a price peg, would have to follow rules limiting it to accredited investors and requiring know-your-customer and anti–money laundering checks.A source with knowledge of the matter told CoinDesk that Basis was bound by the terms of its simple agreement for future tokens (SAFT) and very conservative legal guidance. Unlike typical equity agreements, the SAFT that Basis used left little room for pivoting, and counsel offered little support for other options.That said, the source pinned the blame on Basis’s particular agreements rather than any broad-based condemnation of stablecoins by U.S. regulators. No official communication was ever made by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the source explained. The team came to this conclusion on its own, CoinDesk was told.Backed by not only some of the biggest names in crypto, Basis found support from some of the biggest names in venture capital. Investors included Andreessen Horowitz, Bain Capital Ventures, Lightspeed Ventures and GV (originally Google Ventures).Salil Deshpande of Bain Capital Ventures expressed appreciation for the company’s decision, telling CoinDesk:“At a high level, their bond tokens had to be classified as securities, which meant they’d need to restrict transfers and do accredited investor checks using a centralized whitelisting system. That was totally at odds with the concept of a decentralized independent stablecoin.”Andreessen Horowitz was not immediately available for comment.In a report on the stablecoin industry released in September, Blockchain noted that the company had by far the most open positions listed of any of the leading stablecoin projects, showing 22 in that report.Hiring plans at Basis were fueled by its generous funding. At the time, the company took credit for bringing new institutions into a vision of decentralized finance.“I think we were able to convert a lot of institutions into understanding the full scope of crypto more broadly,” Al-Naji told CoinDesk at the time.In an announcement on the company website, Al-Naji wrote today:“Although this isn’t the outcome any of us wanted, we knew going into this that we were fundamentally making a binary bet on a favorable regulatory landscape.”Updated with additional information. Image via Shutterstock"

Just three weeks ago, it was teasing a short-term bullish reversal above $200.That key support (now resistance), however, was breached on Nov. 14, as bitcoin’s drop below the crucial support of $6,000 dashed hopes of a major bullish reversal, leading to broad-based risk aversion in the cryptomarkets.Ether prices have dropped close to 60 percent in the time since and are currently down a staggering 94 percent from the record high of $1,431 hit in January.So, it is not surprising that bearish sentiment has reached extremes, as seen in the chart below.Notably, ETH/USD short positions on cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex rose to a record high above 340,000 soon before press time – up 183 percent in the last three weeks. Meanwhile, long positions have dropped to the lowest since Sept. 12, as seen in the chart above.Such extreme positioning is usually a sign of oversold conditions and presages market bottoms. However, calling a bullish reversal with that information alone could prove costly.The outlook, therefore, remains bearish until a more credible evidence of trend reversal emerges.As seen above, ETH created a small doji candle last week, implying bearish exhaustion. That pattern, however, has been invalidated with the drop to 19-month lows.Moreover, ether has found acceptance below $102.20 (low of the doji candle), meaning the sell-off from $200 has resumed.The chart also shows that 5- and 10-week simple moving averages (SMAs) are trending south.As a result of all these bear indicators, ETH may extend the decline toward the next major support lined up at $59.00 (March 2017 low).We can, though, expect the momentum may weaken somewhat, as the 14-week relative strength index (RSI) is reporting oversold conditions for the first time December 2016.Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.Ether image via Shutterstock; charts by Trading View"

The announcement of the plan – which involves setting up trading in the petro with a range of currencies – comes after a meeting earlier this week with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow.Maduro added that Russia is already trading oil and other products in Chinese yuan and that Venezuela would follow its example, “progressively” moving to sell all its oil products in petros.Last month, Manuel Quevedo, Venezuela‘s minister of petroleum and the president of state-owned oil company PDVSA, announced that the country will present the petro to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) in 2019, as the “main digital currency backed by oil.”The token was launched in pre-sale in February and Maduro has moved to integrate it into the fabric of the country’s economy. Yet, even before launch, the country’s opposition-controlled congress called the petro illegal borrowing against the nation’s reserves of oil.Venezuela started selling petro to citizens in October via a government portal, saying the token must be used by those seeking to obtain passports.

The app also provides support for crypto collectibles (ERC-721 standard) such as CryptoKitties, as well as ethereum-based decentralized apps, or dapps, that can be accessed from the wallet.“Until now using cryptocurrencies online and accessing Web 3 required special apps or extensions, making it difficult for people to even try it out. Our new browser removes that friction,” Charles Hamel, the product manager of Opera Crypto, said in a statement.Speaking to CoinDesk, Hamel said the new product is largely the same as the beta version, but as it was approaching a “much wider audience” the firm had taken feedback on board and updated the app’s user interface “significantly.”It now displays “less confusing language” to users and reduces the steps needed to set up the wallet.The firm opted to support ethereum because it has the “largest community of developers building dapps and has gathered a lot of momentum behind it,” according to Opera.Opera’s crypto wallet integrates the ethereum Web3 API, facilitating interactions with dapps. The firm is calling it a “tool to access information, make transactions online and manage users’ online identity in a way that gives them more control.”Hamel said that, during the beta stage, Opera had received feedback from developers wanting to ensure their dapps works as intended in the browser.As a result, “we have better stability and better dapp compatibility,” he said, adding that the wallet is “much more secure than a browser extension.”With the Android browser now available on the Google Play store, Opera plans add similar updates to its full desktop browser for Windows, Mac and Linux some time in 2019, while a developer version is already available for testing.Regarding an Apple iOS app, though, Hamel told CoinDesk that, since it’s a more “challenging” and “strict” environment” for app providers to operate, “It’s not a focus for us right now.”Krystian Kolondra, executive vice president for browsers at Opera, said in a statement:“Our hope is that this step will accelerate the transition of cryptocurrencies from speculation and investment to being used for actual payments and transactions in our users’ daily lives.”In October, Opera announced a partnership with blockchain advisory and financial services firm Ledger Capital to further explore blockchain technology. At the time, the two companies said they were seeking new applications and use cases for blockchain, as well as “growth opportunities” for the tech within Opera products.Opera image via Shutterstock"

need to pay taxes if you made a profit. “In order to increase the volume ...","Dec 10, 2018 at 09:00 UTC",A Japanese lawmaker has proposed a number of changes to the current taxation regime in order to ease the burden for cryptocurrency users and encourage adoption of cryptocurrencies in the country.,"In a meeting held earlier this month, Takeshi Fujimaki, a representative of the third-largest opposition political party Nippon Ishin, said that the country’s tax system should not “crush the future” of digital currencies and blockchain technology, and recommended four amendments “to promote the wider [spread] of virtual currency into society.”Firstly, Takeshi suggested that there should be a separate tax rate of 20 percent on crypto gains instead of current up to 55-percent rate because gains from cryptocurrency trades are not stable like salary income and there are chances of incurring losses. Accordingly, gains from cryptos should be taxed on par with other investment options in the country, such as stocks and mutual funds, he said.Secondly, the lawmaker recommended that it should be permissible to carry forward losses from cryptocurrencies in order to have a “fair” system.Currently, if you make a loss in one year and profit in the next from cryptos, you still need to pay tax on the gains that you made in the second year with no allowance for the previous loss. However, in the case of other investment types, such as stocks and property, Takeshi said, taxpayers can deduct losses from the total profit and pay tax on the difference.In his third point, the politician said that there should be a tax exemption for trading between two virtual currencies. For instance, presently when you trade between, say bitcoin and XRP, you need to pay taxes if you made a profit.“In order to increase the volume of transactions between virtual currencies and to revitalize the virtual currency market, trading between virtual currencies should be tax exempt,” Takeshi said, adding that the calculation of profits or losses for such transactions is complex and “extremely cumbersome.”Lastly, he said that in order to increase small payments in virtual currencies, there should be a tax exemption in that area too. For example, currently, when a person pays at a restaurant with bitcoin, they’d need to pay tax on the profit at conversation from fiat to crypto, if any.However, this may hinder the use of cryptos for payments, Takeshi argued, saying:“If you do everything like this, you can not hope for penetration of virtual currency settlement in real society. The small amount of virtual currency settlement should be tax exempt, and the virtual currency settlement in the real world should be expanded.”This is not the first time Takeshi has raised the issue of crypto taxation. Back in June, he suggested changing Japan’s tax policy on cryptocurrency profits from its current “miscellaneous income” classification to “separate declared taxation.” However, Japan’s deputy prime minister pushed back against that suggestion at the time, indicating he was “doubtful” that the general public would understand such a change.In October, the country’s Tax Commission was also looking for ways to simplify the current tax filing system for cryptocurrencies in order to ensure investors accurately report their gains.Yen and bitcoin image via Shutterstock "

However, he faced ...","Nov 26, 2018 at 12:30 UTC",Cryptocurrency mining giant Bitmain is facing a class action lawsuit for over $5 million that alleges unauthorized crypto mining by the firm.,"On Nov. 19, lead plaintiff Los Angeles County resident Gor Gevorkyan filed the case against both Bitmain’s China- and U.S.-based entities in the federal court of the Northern District of California, alleging that the firm’s devices use customers’ resources to mine cryptos for its own benefit prior to full setup.“Until the complicated and time-consuming initialization procedures are completed, Bitmain’s ASIC [Application-Specific Integrated Circuit] devices are preconfigured to use its customers’ electricity to generate crypto currency for the benefit of Bitmain rather than its customers,” reads the filed complaint seen by CoinDesk.The document indicates there are more than 100 class members involved in the action and that the aggregate amount under debate “exceeds $5,000,000, exclusive of interest, fees, and costs.”Gevorkyan said that he purchased Bitmain ASIC devices, including the AntMiner S9, in January of this year to mine bitcoin. However, he faced difficulties configuring the devices and it took time to install them.“During this time, the ASIC devices were pre-configured to mine and deliver crypto currency to Defendant. Also during this time, the ASIC devices operated at full power mode, consuming a substantial amount of electricity at Plaintiffs’ expense,” the complaint states.It further adds that this “unfair business practice” by Bitmain continued until the ASIC devices were linked with Gevorkyan’s personal cryptocurrency account.As a result, Gevorkyan and the other members are seeking “full restitution of all expenses incurred as a result of Bitmain’s unfair and deceptive practices” and an order requiring Bitmain to “cease the acts of unfair competition alleged”, as well as interest at the highest rate allowable and other fees and costs.In summary, the complaint said:“Conveniently, Bitmain cashes in on every second it takes to get the ASIC configured with the customers’ specifications and lays the substantial costs of operating the ASIC devices at the feet of its customers.”“Bitmain does not mine with customers’ equipment and, considering that mining for itself is a small part of Bitmain’s business, it has less incentive to do so compared to shipping the equipment as soon as possible to fulfill any confirmed orders,” the firm said in an email to CoinDesk.Earlier this month, Bitmain itself filed a suit against an anonymous thief in a U.S. federal court who allegedly stole 617 bitcoin from an account it holds at crypto exchange Binance.Editor’s note: This story has been updated to include comment from Bitmain.Gavel and bitcoin image via Shutterstock"

When they do, we want to meet them there,” said Biancamano.He went on to explain:“There is a very high level of interest but no need to move because currently none of our clients are looking for us to house these assets in custody.”Recent announcements around large institutions such as Fidelity Investments taking up crypto as an asset class has led to a febrile sense of anticipation among Wall Street incumbents and crypto-native companies alike.Coinbase and BitGo, who joined State Street on the Block FS custody panel, have gained qualified custodian licenses. Meanwhile, in the traditional custody world, Northern Trust and Japanese bank Nomura are known to be working on digital asset custody solutions.State Street would not be drawn to answer a question on whether it is building a solution or looking to “acqu-ihire”, as some commentators have suggested.“We follow our clients’ assets,” Biancamano remarked. “We do talk to our clients who are interested in doing this and we are looking at this very closely. But we are not putting a sign that we are opening for business. That said, we are a blockchain-friendly firm; we are very involved in the vertical.”On the subject of how regulation will coalesce around custody solutions for crypto assets, Biancamano said the SEC has been engaging traditional providers to better understand the current state-of-play, which he called “refreshing”.Alluding to an inevitable convergence with State Street’s custody business at some point in the future, he added:“It’s not just about the current cryptocurrency; it’s also about tokenization and digitalization of traditional assets too.”State Street image via EyeofPaul/Shutterstock.com"

Research. News; Learn; Research. Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Nov 29, 2018 at 13:59 UTC","Flipside Crypto wants investors to think beyond market capitalization, and Coinbase apparently agrees.","Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, the exchange’s Coinbase Ventures arm and Digital Currency Group co-led the analytics startup’s extended seed round that closed on November 21, alongside True Ventures and Castle Island Ventures. Although the size of Coinbase’s investment was not disclosed and the company declined to comment on the move, all told Flipside has raised $4.5 million.“Coinbase has substantial interest in what data can do to help their customers be most effective at understanding and take part in this space,” Flipside Crypto CEO Dave Balter told CoinDesk. “We look forward to working with them on that.”Boston-based Flipside tracks network activity and developer contributions to GitHub projects, among other factors, to determine how various assets are evolving and being used. Founded in 2017, the startup analyzes 1,000 crypto assets and scores them, factoring in global market caps and trading patterns as just 5 percent of each asset’s overall “fcast” score.The firm uses multiple algorithms to map out trading patterns and says it can distinguish exchange activity from other types of transactions, like payments or moving crypto to a personal wallet. Similar to CoinDesk’s Crypto Economics Explorer, the idea is to give a more well-rounded view of crypto valuations rather than fickle trading prices.“It starts with understanding the difference between speculation and actual usage,” Flipside board member Adam D’Augelli, a partner at True Ventures, told CoinDesk.So far, over 100 investors have used these metrics from the startup’s closed beta while Flipside partnered with institutions like the investment bank Canaccord Genuity to create detailed evaluation reports. Plus, according to Balter, several more institutions plan to partner with the startup when the platform launches publicly in early 2019.Balter went on to say that only the top 100 cryptocurrencies have any real traction at this point. However, he believes measuring blockchain activity and developer contributions can offer a holistic perspective of how an asset is maturing.“Price is an ineffective tool for understanding the value of these assets,” Balter said. “What you really need to pay attention to is, are customers using this product? How is that changing? And are developers actually building?”This combination of analytics can help predict market signals, according to Flipside. For example, XRP’s fcast score spiked in September, partly reflecting GitHub activity, as the fintech company Ripple was quietly rolling out a new initiative making it easier for banks to use the cryptocurrency.“As they [Ripple] begin developing for that partnership to get announced, they are doing code work. They’ve got customers testing the product. They are doing all the things that a typical business would do before making an announcement,” Balter said, adding:“It’s highly indicative of good, healthy company behaviors. If they are focusing on the business, you will see the fcast [score] move. If they are just focused pumping the price, that fcast isn’t going to change.”For D’Augelli, whose fund also invested in cryptocurrency projects like the Chia Network, TruStory, and ZeppelinOS, insights that must be collected in the moment or quickly evaporate or get buried in the slush could prove invaluable to cryptocurrency creators.“If you’re a crypto project today you don’t have a way to benchmark yourself against others, to reach out to your end customers, to understand if people are engaging in the right way,” D’Augelli said. “Those same tools that are useful for investors to understand the fundamental value of projects also help projects build better customer experiences and understand how they are doing.”Starting early next year, people who want more detailed reports and live updates from Flipside will be able to pay for subscriptions to ranging from $25–$300 a month, depending on what types of data insights they need.The startup’s mailing list already includes roughly 1,000 prospective subscribers, including venture capitalists, retail investors, and developer teams.As Flipside’s backer Coinbase looks to aggressively add new assets in 2019, such metrics could prove useful for the exchange unicorn as well.Speaking to the current market conditions, Balter concluded:“The projects that [will] win, that move through this winter of despair into growth, like Amazon from the dotcom bubble, are the ones that are actually showing that customer movement.”Image of co-founders Dave Balter (L), Jim Myers (C) and Eric Stone (R) via Flipside Crypto"

Research. News; Learn; Research. Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Nov 21, 2018 at 12:00 UTC","As Wall Street raises the stakes around cryptocurrency, large institutional players are circling this new asset class and bringing with them their own set of requirements. ","For example, there’s a need for qualified custodians to hold the assets these big-money investors will trade, as in the traditional, regulated financial realm. But a less-discussed yet critical condition for making institutions feel at home is providing adequate insurance against theft for all those custodied assets. The problem is that there’s not enough of this insurance to go around.While insurance is an opaque market, estimates of the total amount of coverage the industry is willing to provide to crypto custodians and exchanges top out at $6 billion – a drop in the bucket, considering that the top three exchanges each handle more than $1 billion of trades a day, to say nothing of the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies of $140 billion, even after this week’s brutal sell-off. And that’s the optimistic insurance scenario.“Total available capacity for crypto-related crime insurance placements starkly lags demand,” said Jacqueline Quintal, financial institutions practice leader at insurance broker Aon Risk Solutions, Insurance is critical for getting institutions to invest because unlike stocks and bonds, crypto is for all intents and purposes a bearer asset. Once a thief obtains the private keys to a wallet, the money is gone, like cash or jewelry pilfered from a safe. And despite the 2018 bear market, crypto remains a juicy target for criminals around the world, as evidenced by kidnapping and extortion cases from New York to India. The large amounts institutions would hold would only compound the risk.One reason for the shortage is that right now there’s a chicken-and-egg problem for the insurance industry: there is almost nothing to go on in terms of a history of losses and claims, which underwriters crave to model the risks involved.“Increasing numbers of policyholders will be looking for comfort that they have specific coverage that is expected to apply in the event of a blockchain-related loss,” said Daniel J. Healy, a partner in the Washington, D.C., office of the law firm Anderson Kill.In this context, it’s notable that one of the big exchanges, San Francisco-based Coinbase, has eaten up a huge chunk of the cover being written, with about $250 million worth, according to people familiar with the situation. To put that figure in perspective, Quintal said limits depend on the type of wallets and storage but around $100 million is about right for an exchange doing a mix of hot and cold storage, i.e. online and offline wallets, respectively. For purely cold storage, “you can get considerably north of that figure,” she said.While Coinbase would not discuss numbers, Philip Martin, the company’s vice president of security at Coinbase, acknowledged that it’s one of the market’s largest consumers. Noting that Coinbase has been active in obtaining crypto insurance since 2013, and that the market is still in its infancy, Martin told CoinDesk:“We are definitely at the high end of coverage in this space … There’s not yet a ton of capacity.”Greg Spore, US placement leader, financial and professional practice at insurance broker Marsh, cautioned to take any claims about a single company’s coverage with a grain of salt.“You do hear rumors in the market that an insured [party] could, for their own reasons, want to promote that they have more limits than they have; maybe their customers get a sense of comfort if they have greater limits and so maybe the stated limit is $200 million,” said Spore.“But actually, there is some type of coinsurance provision, where it means, in reality, there is only $100 million in risk transfer,” since the insured party pays a share of the claim. Stepping back, there are two distinct types of insurance product providing crypto policies today: the commercial crime market and the specie market. Commercial crime covers things like cash in ATMs or moved around in armored cars, and it’s this market that generally provides coverage for “hot” wallets, where the keys are in a device connected to the internet.On the other hand, the specie market has traditionally insured vaults or specially designed premises where high-value items like gold bullion or art are stored. It’s this sort of cover that custodians are looking at for cold storage, where the private keys to a wallet are kept on a piece of paper or an offline device.  Any large exchange is probably talking to both the crime and specie markets. Coinbase, for example, holds less than 2 percent of assets in hot wallets and the remaining 98 percent in cold storage. (At its height during the crypto bull market, the company stored $25 billion worth of assets on customers’ behalf, but the company would not provide a recent figure.)One large policyholder who has studied the market extensively estimated that the commercial crime market’s capacity is relatively low, less than $1 billion and probably in the vicinity of $750 million. This source, who did not want to be identified, pegged the specie market’s global capacity for crypto assets at $3 billion to $5 billion, for a total insurance industry appetite of $6 billion at best. On a more granular level, Spore said he knows of specie consortiums that have the capacity to cover up to $660 million of cold storage only for a single entity. However, it’s highly unlikely any crypto firm would get that amount, he said.Conversely, hot storage-only capacity would not even approach $200 million, Spore said.There is also a stark disparity in premiums depending on whether the crypto being insured is in a hot or cold wallet. “In terms of the pricing, they are really in different stratospheres,” Spore said.The way crypto insurance generally accumulates is via one or two underwriters who understand the risk deeply and then the rest of the capital follows their lead. For example, a lead underwriter may toss $5 million to $10 million of capacity to a “tower” and the rest gets filled out by 30 or 40 other syndicates.In this structure, if there is a theft of crypto, the underwriter at the base of the metaphorical tower will be the first to pay claims after the deductible, followed by the next one up, and so on. The higher an insurer is in the stack, the less risky the position, and hence the smaller a premium it will demand.  There are at most half a dozen underwriters willing to take the first-loss position, numerous market participants said.  (Underwriters are generally publicity-shy when it comes to crypto, but some big names linked to the space include AIG, Chubb and XL Group.)Hence, the cost of cover for a mix of hot and cold storage works out to between 1 percent and 2 percent of total insurance purchased, usually depending on assets under custody, but that figure can be “highly variable,” said Quintal at Aon, which has been arranging insurance policies in the crypto space since the early days of 2014.Cold storage-only solutions will get you closer to the bottom of the range, as will “high total limits,” she said, explaining that the first few layers of capacity (say, $5 million to $10 million) will be more expensive than the next and last ones, which drives the overall average rate down as you buy more.Insurance of crypto assets is generally offered on an all-or-nothing basis. In other words, a custodian can’t offer it as an option to each customer; it has to insure everything, according to Ari Paul, chief investment officer and managing partner at BlockTower Capital. This makes it expensive, and the cost is passed to investors.If the custody service itself costs 50 basis points, for instance, then adding 1 percent to that is tripling the cost, noted Paul. “One and a half percent total fees for custody is very high, compared to the traditional world. To a pension, that feels like a lot,” he said.Today the vast majority of crypto insurance is written out of London. That said, Coinbase’s policy includes participation from underwriters in New York, a first for the crypto space, according to a source familiar with the arrangement. The Bahamas is also said to be starting to show an interest in this market.The hub for crypto cover, nevertheless, is Lloyd’s of London, the centuries-old insurance market where ship-owners and captains originally clubbed together into syndicates to spread the risk of losing their cargos. Last year some 85 Lloyd’s syndicates, comprised of corporations and individuals, collectively wrote £33.6 billion ($43.3 billion) of gross premiums covering a wide range of property and liability. Brokers have been working with Lloyd’s to educate underwriters and show that crypto insurance presents a significant opportunity to the London market (which last year took a battering thanks to numerous hurricanes and wildfires).  Yet, following an unprecedented announcement this summer that Lloyd’s was underwriting custody of crypto assets, industry sources said underwriters in the London market have put the brakes on this activity, under pressure from the umbrella organization of Lloyd’s. “I wouldn’t call it a clampdown,” a representative for Lloyd’s told CoinDesk, adding:  “Lloyd’s has written a small number of policies in recent years for cryptocurrencies. However, in view of the fact that this is a new and rapidly evolving area Lloyd’s does require syndicates to proceed with caution and additional underwriting scrutiny.”While Lloyd’s wouldn’t give specifics on what form the syndicates’ additional scrutiny has taken, underwriters have been requiring independent reviews of crypto custody solutions carried out by technically adept third parties.The cost is borne by the placing custodial company, and it does not come cheap. “It will run anywhere from $50,000 to $150,000 for the company to come in and do that,” said Jerry Pluard, president of Safe Deposit Box Insurance Co.Financial costs aside, these reviews also require companies to open the proverbial kimono. “There’s a real concern for the custodians about exposing their proprietary information; that level of review starts at the foundation and goes up to the roof,” said Pluard. Aon’s Quintal acknowledged the concern among custodians in sharing proprietary details, but said some degree of technology and security information is absolutely essential to securing a policy.  “Based on experience, there are ways to be specific enough without revealing too much,” she said.Besides, engaging a company to survey a vault is a very traditional approach to underwriting, noted Martin of Coinbase, concluding,“Maybe they are taking that approach with newer risks, or more risky risks, if you will.”Lloyd’s of London image via Shutterstock"

For example, it includes an option to generate a 24-word mnemonic seed phrase for users’ private keys, a “balances tab” to inform users of the status of their accounts and a “user icon” in the navigation bar that shows individual wallet addresses.With the blockchain explorer, users can search for an individual block and view transactions included in a particular block, the demo explains.“User funds on the DEX will be secured with decentralized wallet applications like Trust Wallet, which has a server-free infrastructure that stores private keys only on the user’s device, meaning only users have access to their funds,” Binance said in a statement on Wednesday.Binance DEX is built on its own Binance Chain, which was first unveiled in March of this year and is aimed to offer “low latency, high throughput trading, as well as decentralized custody of funds.”With the DEX, traders will be able to send and receive Binance’s own BNB tokens and other coins via trading pairs, Binance said, adding that while BNB is currently an ERC-20 token, it will soon be migrated to Binance Chain upon its mainnet launch.The first video demo of Binance DEX was released in August, which outlined via a command line interface the basics of issuing, listing and trading crypto assets.In June, Singapore-based cryptocurrency exchange Huobi also announced a plan to evolve into a standalone decentralized exchange, offering funding for developer assistance in creating an open-sourced blockchain protocol.Binance image via Shutterstock; DEX images via Binance"

While mining directly using software clients or via other apps earns computer owners cryptocurrency, SoftMiner instead rewards them with loyalty points under Razer’s Silver program; the amount of “silver” they get depends on the processing power of their computers and the amount of time dedicated to running the app, among more technical factors.The loyalty points can later be redeemed in-store for discounts on Razer products, merchandise, gift vouchers and more, the firm says.The app has also seen some push-back on social media, with one Twitter user summing up the app concept as: “Razer SoftMiner uses your GPU to mine cryptocurrency, but you don’t get the coins.”SoftMiner has been built using the same engine as GammaNow, a similar desktop app that rewards users for handing over their unused GPU processing power.While the news might seem an easy way for owners of powerful gaming machines to earn some extra cash-equivalent, it comes as miners are struggling to make ends meet with prices down at least 80 percent across many cryptos this year. As a result, single GPU miners are unlikely to make significant earnings even if mining directly via dedicated software.Last month, Taiwan-based tech giant Asus similarly moved to allow gamers to use their graphics cards to earn a share of profits from cryptocurrency mining.

Another 20 companies are currently in the queue to be added, Selkis said.In its initial stages, the Messari team will be walking projects through their applications, but the ultimate goal is to decentralize the platform.

after, subject to approval by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.","Dec 10, 2018 at 14:00 UTC",ErisX is beefing up its leadership ahead of the launch of cryptocurrency spot and futures trading early next year.,"Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, the digital asset trading platform has hired markets and exchanges veteran Matt Trudeau as chief strategy officer. The news comes a week after ErisX closed a Series B funding round that raised $27.5 million from firms such as Bitmain, ConsenSys, Fidelity Investments, Nasdaq Ventures and Monex Group.Trudeau started his trading career in the early 2000s when the U.S. equities market was going digital and has overseen some 10 global market launches including Instinet, Chi-X, IEX and most recently Tradewind, where he looked specifically at how to tokenize and trade precious metals. Outside of crypto and financial circles, he is best known as one of the heroes of Michael Lewis’ bestseller “Flash Boys,” which tells the story of IEX, a stock exchange founded to promote fairer markets by creating speed bumps for high-frequency trading. “I have seen first hand the difference between market revolutions and more incremental evolutions,” Trudeau told CoinDesk. “Clearly, crypto markets were a bit of revolution at the outset and now it feels more like we are at a stage where it needs to be more evolutionary.”In his new role, Trudeau is tasked with thinking about the long term, beyond the current bear market conditions in crypto.“There is the tactical trading aspects of what’s going on in the market right now. But you need to take the long view. Some of best internet businesses were started after the dotcom crash,” he said. Thomas Chippas, CEO of ErisX, agreed and added: “Would it be better if the price of crypto were generally going up? Of course it would. But stocks have been volatile recently too, if we were talking about equities and a stock exchange, nobody is going to say, ‘are you going to open your doors tomorrow?’”Backed by a range of large trading firms such as DRW and TD Ameritrade, as well as crypto specialists such as ConsenSys, ErisX aims to launch spot trading in bitcoin, bitcoin cash, litecoin, and ethereum by Q2 2019. Futures contracts in bitcoin (and possibly other coins) will follow shortly after, subject to approval by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.Unlike the bitcoin futures that the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Chicago Board Options Exchange (also a backer of ErisX) have been offering for almost a year now, ErisX’s contracts will be settled in actual bitcoin, rather than in cash. But ErisX won’t be alone in listing so-called physically settled contracts, as New York Stock Exchange parent ICE is poised to offer one-day physically settled bitcoin futures on its Bakkt platform in January. As far as futures in other coins appearing on the platform, Chippas said: “Everything here is going to be subject to approval. But we are working with the commission [CFTC] during our application phase here and will say more about which products would launch thereafter.” Like many other firms building institutional-grade crypto offerings, ErisX is in the process of securing a range of regulatory licenses. It is in the process of gaining a Derivatives Clearing Organization (DCO) license from the CFTC, while on the spot side, the team has been gathering state-based money transmitter licenses. 
“You have to go state by state and the laws are slightly different in each state, so you have to make a state-level application. We already have a substantial number and we have others in flight,” said Chippas.Trudeau added that what ErisX is doing with the spot market and futures fits more neatly into some of the pre-existing constructs, as opposed to things like alternative trading system (ATS) licenses from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for crypto firms. “If you are introducing something regulators haven’t had an opportunity to really look at and study, they are going to take their time and learn,” said Trudeau, with regard to the SEC. “I think with what we are seeing in the market with ATS’s and securities tokens is that some of those things are less crisply defined at this point so they require a bit more study.”Matt Trudeau image via LendIt Conference/YouTube"

the offense and their associated bitcoin addresses. OFAC is ...","Dec 2, 2018 at 11:40 UTC",Beau Barnes and Jake Chervinsky of Kobre & Kim LLP are litigators and government enforcement defense attorneys who specialize in disputes and investigations related to digital assets. This article is not intended to provide legal advice.,"———For the past year, the cryptocurrency industry’s attention has focused on the Securities and Exchange Commission’s deliberations over how to enforce U.S. securities laws. But the past two months have seen important developments on a new regulatory front: the application of U.S. sanctions laws by the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).Last week, OFAC sanctioned two Iranian individuals for cyberattacks against U.S. networks. For the first time ever, OFAC targeted both the individuals who committed the offense and their associated bitcoin addresses.OFAC is announcing a clear message to the industry: comply with sanctions laws or pay the price.Economic sanctions result from U.S. government policy decisions that certain countries, governments, individuals, or companies shouldn’t be allowed to transact with “U.S. persons.” The category of “U.S. persons” is expansive: it includes U.S. citizens and permanent residents anywhere in the world, non-U.S. nationals within the United States, and entities incorporated under U.S. law (as well as their foreign branches).OFAC has broad authority to impose sanctions based on perceived threats to U.S. national security. OFAC typically imposes “primary sanctions” by prohibiting U.S. persons from directly or indirectly transacting with a sanctioned party, in addition to “secondary sanctions” based on a non-U.S. person’s transactions with other sanctioned parties.Some sanctions are nearly absolute, such as those prohibiting almost all transactions with countries like Iran, while other sanctions are nuanced, like those prohibiting certain transactions with Venezuela related to certain debt transactions. Sanctions violations are punishable as civil or criminal offenses and can result in steep fines.Unlike many regulatory agencies, OFAC doesn’t impose formal compliance obligations. Instead, it oversees a “strict liability” regime: even unintentional sanctions violations are punishable under the law, no matter the time or resources a company devotes to compliance. That said, those with a strong compliance program will have better odds of convincing OFAC to take a lenient approach toward potential violations.To help companies build out their sanctions compliance programs, OFAC publishes a variety of policy statements, FAQs, brochures, advisories, and press releases. OFAC also offers compliance suggestions for stakeholders in specific industries.For example, OFAC advises companies involved in online commerce to “develop a tailored, risk-based compliance program” including the use of sanctions list screening software. Similarly, OFAC recommends that money transmitters block IP addresses from sanctioned jurisdictions, gather detailed customer identification information, and record a “purpose of payment” for every transaction.To fill the gaps left by its public statements, OFAC also engages in “guidance by enforcement,” detailing specific violations and the mitigating and aggravating factors that it considered in determining an appropriate fine.In 2015, for example, OFAC announced a settlement with PayPal over approximately $44,000 in transactions that violated various sanctions programs. The settlement described numerous compliance missteps, including PayPal’s failure to screen accountholders against the sanctions list. It required PayPal to pay over $7 million and underscored to payment processors and money transmitters the importance of compliance – even for relatively low-value transactions.While other U.S. federal agencies have been commenting on the rise of cryptocurrencies for years, OFAC long remained silent despite requests from crypto industry stakeholders for clarity on U.S. sanctions laws. This year, OFAC began to weigh in.In March, OFAC responded to the Venezuelan government’s launch of its own cryptocurrency–the Petro–by prohibiting U.S. persons from engaging in transactions with that asset. OFAC also issued FAQs noting that U.S. persons’ sanctions obligations are the same “regardless of whether a transaction is denominated in a digital currency or traditional fiat currency” and flagging that it may add cryptocurrency addresses to the sanctions list in the future.In October, in light of the U.S. government’s decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal and re-impose certain sanctions against Iran, the Treasury Department issued an advisory warning businesses about Iran’s efforts to fund illicit activities abroad. The advisory described the Iranian regime’s practice of circumventing financial restrictions by transacting in precious metals, misusing exchange houses, counterfeiting currency, and transacting in “virtual currencies.”In warning about the risks of cryptocurrencies, the advisory recommended specific compliance steps for crypto companies, including “reviewing blockchain ledgers for activity that may originate or terminate in Iran,” using software to “monitor open blockchains,” and screening customers against the sanctions list.Last week’s designation of two Iranians who executed ransomware attacks on U.S. companies was OFAC’s first action in direct relation to crypto. In a press release, OFAC trumpeted the designation, highlighting that it had identified those individuals’ bitcoin addresses “for the first time” in order to “assist those in the compliance and digital currency communities in identifying transactions and funds that must be blocked and investigating any connections to these addresses.”OFAC also released additional FAQs addressing crypto companies’ obligations to block sanctioned persons and Treasury Under Secretary Sigal Mandelker said the Department “will aggressively pursue Iran and other rogue regimes attempting to exploit digital currencies.”OFAC’s recent actions illustrate the U.S. government’s renewed focus on stopping authoritarian regimes–Venezuela, Iran, North Korea, and others–from using cryptocurrencies to evade U.S. sanctions. The crypto industry now finds itself caught in the middle of several intense geopolitical conflicts.So, what’s a crypto company to do?First, take compliance seriously. As OFAC has noted, all the compliance obligations are the same regardless of whether a transaction involves digital or fiat currency.Second, understand the risks. Because OFAC doesn’t require specific compliance efforts, companies aren’t obligated to screen customers against the sanctions list or restrict user access in certain environments. But, companies should know that they ignore these risks at their peril.Third, expect enforcement. OFAC, like many government agencies, provides guidance in part by publicizing its enforcement actions. It will be no surprise when OFAC begins to bring enforcement actions in 2019 against those who transact in cryptocurrencies without respecting U.S. sanctions.Iranian rial and U.S. dollar image via Shutterstock"

While Huobi’s exchange business is now based in Singapore, it still has blockchain consulting and research operations on the Chinese mainland.The Communist Party requires firms with at least three party members to set up such committees, although it is standard for public entities to do so, according to local sources. In recent years, however, making the more formal tie to the ruling party has become more common at private enterprises.And while Chinese authorities have clamped down on many crypto activities, including token sales, they are actively promoting the adoption of blockchain technology. Indeed, the Communist Party moved to make blockchain literacy the norm across public offices with the publication of an explainer for officials and members in August.Huobi committee launch ceremony image via the company’s website"

We look forward to continued progress on achieving resilient non-bank financial intermediation.”Moreover, the statement said members will work to realize the potential benefits of applying technology to the financial sector, as part of this push.The group’s latest statement is a continuation of its ongoing look into the crypto space. G20 finance ministers announced they would be looking for specific regulations after calls from France, Germany, the U.S. and Japan this past March.While a document from July indicated that the group was eyeing an October deadline for reviewing a document on AML standards for crypto, it is unclear whether they have done so.G20 banners image via Alexandr Vorobev / Shutterstock"

Amendment done. Process of filing was in rush. Mistakes in that case happens.”The firm’s estimated liabilities and number of creditors remain the same as in the previous petition, at $10 million–$50 million and 1–49, respectively.Giga Watt filed for bankruptcy on Monday with millions of dollars still owed to creditors, including hundreds of thousands to two electricity providers. Its biggest 20 unsecured creditors have claims worth nearly $7 million, according to the firm.The firm was launched by veteran bitcoin miner Dave Carlson in May 2017 and held an initial coin offering (ICO) the same month that raised about $22 million-worth of cryptocurrency at the time.This January, however, a group of plaintiffs sued Giga Watt claiming it conducted an unregistered securities offering and seeking the return of their investments.Carlson left the firm quietly in August, after a number of job layoffs, according to reports.The company’s collapse comes as times are increasingly hard for miners. The price of bitcoin, for example, hit a 14-month low near $4,000 earlier this week, having peaked at almost $20,000 last December.

Research. News; Learn; Research. Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Nov 20, 2018 at 05:01 UTC","“Of the states, I think we’ve got about 20 percent of all the active cease-and-desists.”","That’s Greg Bordenkircher, the chief litigator at the Alabama Securities Commission, describing the extent to which his state, just the 24th largest by population, has nonetheless come to play a leading role in the ongoing fight against U.S. crypto fraud.“We’ve issued nine orders shutting down businesses that are advertising in Alabama,” he told CoinDesk. “We have another 20, 22 that we are looking at right now.”But Bordenkircher’s agency is hardly alone. As a member of the North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA), it’s part of a coalition that’s been conducting a continent-wide sweep of initial coin offerings in an effort to sniff out illicit activities. To date, regulators in South Carolina, Colorado and Texas have taken on suspect ICOs as well, and Canadian prosecutors have also played an important role in the sweep.NASAA’s website lists a number of actions taken by the State of Massachusetts, too.The sweep started with a list of 300 or so projects, but the latest numbers have those being investigated down to 200 (some have been determined not to be fraudulent).While much of the attention in crypto has been on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), state action is an important facet of chasing bad actors out of the market, he argued.Bordenkircher told CoinDesk:“The SEC does a great job and CFTC does a great job, but the states have really got the boots on the ground. There’s more of us than there are of them.”Still, federal and state-level agencies are coordinating, sharing information and breaking up the work.“It’s almost a task force view of all of us coordinating together,” he said.Bordenkircher (pictured above, seated) runs the Alabama wing of the operation, mainly with Michael Gantt (also pictured), a special agent assigned to the sweep, running the day-to-day efforts. The state contracts with Cyber Forensics, a consultancy that helps them keep all the digital evidence they gather defensible in court.And that’s really key to getting the ICO industry in control, because “wherever the hot issue is, that’s where the fraudsters go,” Bordenkircher said.Through almost all of 2017 and the first part of 2018, no doubt, that was ICOs.To stop the toxic ICOs, Bordenkircher has imported a battle plan he used at the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) for fighting arms traders.Prior to his work with the state of Alabama, Bordenkircher served at the DOJ as an assistant U.S. attorney for the Southern District of the State of Alabama. There, he took a leadership role in complex litigation. One part of the strategy as it related to chasing arms dealers across the internet was looking for buyers and sellers and matching up their deals.So when the NASAA began the sweep, Bordenkircher sought the same resources to repeat that and other strategies used during his time in the federal government.The strategy involves setting up computer systems that are firewalled off (using virtual private networks) from the state systems that can visit suspicious websites and track activity without the people who built the site realizing they are being visited by law enforcement.The system even uses a technique familiar to the cryptocurrency community – cryptographic hashes. These hashes preserve a website, proving the data was logged at a certain time and that it hasn’t been changed, even though the system dismantles the site to keep other users from interacting with it.To build this system, Alabama has contracted with online evidence gathering consultancy, Cyber Forensics, which Bordenkircher first worked with at the DOJ. Cyber Forensics make the first pass at various sites to determine whether or not a given project (or group of projects) has enough red flags to refer to Alabama’s investigators for further action.Both the contractors and the state investigators are looking for signs that projects are luring unsuspecting investors who lack the savvy to spot impossible claims.Gus Dimitrelos, the president of Cyber Forensics and a former special agent with the U.S. Secret Service, told CoinDesk:“There’s probably 12 to 17 different ways for these fraudsters to get victims to come to them.”Echoing this, Bordenkircher said, “When we get X amount of red flags, then we have to make a legal determination at that point that this needs to be at least shut down, if not prosecuted.”Provided prosecutors verify that the offering appears to be a security and that its soliciting citizens of their state without a license to deal securities, the state can then move forward on an investigation and further action.To shut these projects down, the state will send suspected fraudsters a cease-and-desist letter that gives the operation 30 days to report back to the state if they believe their company has been erroneously targeted. So far, Bordenkircher told CoinDesk, no team has tried to defend their operation. Instead, they just close up shop in the state and disappear.Although, one British company did respond, agreeing that it shouldn’t solicit U.S. investors and then firewalled off the country.While there’s no official checklist that guarantees an operation is fraudulent, the investigators walked CoinDesk through a number of the things they look for – some of which would be difficult for an average web user to detect.Multiple IPs – Multiple IP addresses that all point back to one company or person is not normal. In many cases, this can mean one operation is setting up multiple phony ICOs (or frauds of other kinds) and running them out of the same office.Phony physical addresses – The street address might not square with what should be a legitimate business location. For instance, one ICO project’s address turned out to be the same as that of the Ohio Attorney General.Location masking – Is there evidence that the operation is making an effort to appear to be in the United States when it is, in fact, located overseas?A non-sensical pitch – A frequent critique made about token projects is that companies are applying blockchain just to build buzz. Bordenkircher took that further for fraudulent ICOs, saying, “Some of them, they have the verbiage, but I don’t think they really understand what blockchain is.”Copy-and-paste – If data is copy-and-pasted across multiple websites that appear to be marketing different projects, that’s a clear red flag. This is a broadly used tactic by fraudsters in the crypto space, with the easiest area to use this being team photos, where the same stock photo faces are showing up across multiple project websites.Unrealistic claims – “What are they saying the returns going to be? A lot of them are using language like ‘guaranteed return of 1 percent a day,’ which is, it has to be fraudulent,” Bordenkircher said. Or if they claim to have assets that don’t make sense. For example, projects that claim to be backed by a diamond mine or projects that claim part of the returns will be paid out in actual gold sent to investors.On top of these initial red flags, there are also a couple of behaviors that require investigators to take some kind of action first.Aggressive sales – “One of the badges of fraud is trying to see how aggressive they are trying to get us to send them money,” Bordenkircher said. If an investigator emails once and they get multiple calls in return, that’s a strong sign further investigation is needed. Good brokers will always follow up, he said, but it’s fraudsters that do it to excess.Selling to the wrong customers – Since the rules surrounding crypto token sales in the U.S. are still a bit opaque, many ICO projects have eschewed U.S. investors. While some projects state in their white papers and on their website that they won’t accept U.S. investors, they still buy U.S. hosting services and run ads targeting U.S. customers. Then if a U.S.-based investor shows interest, the company won’t hesitate to encourage them to send money.To verify this kind of behavior, law enforcement needs to reach out. Since fraudsters wouldn’t respond to such inquiries if they were suspicious law enforcement was behind them, the ability to hide behind a virtual private network is important.But the next frontier for law enforcement in catching fraudsters will be setting up profiles that lure them in. Cyber Forensics has already begun building fake social profiles of people who show interest in investing and making money.Just as the fraudsters have devised websites that lure victims, the company hopes it can find a formula that lures the predators.And with these new techniques in the queue, Bordenkircher said, the action they’ve taken so far is nowhere close to all the action that will be taken to bring down phony crypto token projects. This is especially true since the courts have affirmed the authority of various agencies to bring action.Speaking to this, Bordenkircher told CoinDesk:“It’s only going to accelerate until there is a more regimented regulatory system.”Yet, still, Bordenkircher is quick to acknowledge that the regulatory agency is trying to tread carefully so as not to stifle innovation in the space.“We don’t want to limit in any way legitimate ICOs or legitimate utility coins or people who are trying to raise legitimate businesses,” he said.Smokey Scales of Justice statue image via Shutterstock"

Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Nov 26, 2018 at 09:00 UTC","Ripple is rolling out a new version of its most popular product, xCurrent.","Positioned as a rival to SWIFT – the 45-year-old messaging network at the center of the global payments infrastructure – version 4.0 of xCurrent is being more closely integrated with Ripple’s other major offering, xRapid.xRapid uses the cryptocurrency XRP to provide what the company calls “on-demand liquidity” in cross-border transactions: the ability to use XRP as a bridge currency in the middle of a cross-border payment corridor, which Ripple says eliminates payment processors’ need to pre-fund bank accounts in destination countries.Describing xCurrent 4.0, Ripple SVP of product Asheesh Birla told CoinDesk:“What this release enables you to do is that in countries where you think it’s appropriate and xRapid’s available, using your xCurrent software, you can now plug into on-demand liquidity using xRapid.”The roll-out of xCurrent 4.0 began in September, a company spokesperson told CoinDesk, and customers – which include American Express, Santander and Itaú – are currently being transitioned to the new version.Birla did not give an exact timeline for completing the upgrades – he noted that xCurrent is an “on-premise software package,” meaning it’s tailored to each customer to some extent – but said that any new customers would begin with version 4.0.Yet the xRapid integration, Birla stressed, is entirely optional.“In other countries, where there’s not good regulatory clearance or digital asset infrastructure, you just continue to use xCurrent as-is, with fiat liquidity,” he said.So far, a Ripple spokesperson told CoinDesk, no xCurrent 4.0 users have opted for xRapid integration.CoinDesk reached out to several Ripple customers regarding the new version of xCurrent. A BBVA spokesperson said the bank had tested a Ripple product last year, but declined to specify which one or provide an update.A spokesman at Banco Santander, said the bank “uses xCurrent only, not xRapid or XRP. And the bank has not upgraded so far.” He added that “Santander does not need nowadays that upgrade to deliver all the benefits of One Pay FX,” a mobile payments app.Ripple announced in October that three companies – MercuryFX, Cuallix and Catalyst Corporate Credit Union – were implementing xRapid for commercial payments.Under the existing system, Birla said, financial institutions can spend months setting up bank accounts in foreign countries and funding them with enough local currency to provide liquidity.With xRapid, companies trade the originating country’s currency for XRP and then use XRP to purchase the currency of the destination country. “The feedback so far from our customers,” he said, “is using the xRapid experience cuts down on cost, but also cuts down on setup time.”Independent market makers on cryptocurrency exchanges are needed to provide the liquidity for these transactions. Ripple has partnered with three exchanges – Bittrex, Coins.ph and Bitso – to facilitate xRapid payments between U.S. dollars and Philippine pesos, and U.S. dollars and Mexican pesos.“They’re two of the larger destinations for payments, and they have good infrastructure,” Birla said of Mexico and the Philippines, adding, “we picked those to get started and we want to go from there.”Still, the new version of xCurrent offers benefits to customers who have not chosen to integrate xRapid.Among the most notable improvements in xCurrent 4.0 is a feature called “multihop,” which allows payments to be relayed through a chain of xCurrent users. The existing payments system relies on a few large money center banks such as Citi, which act as hubs, Birla said.Multihop could allow smaller regional players such as Siam Commercial Bank in Thailand to “get the same sort of reach that a larger correspondent bank can,” he added.Given financial institutions’ compliance concerns, each “hop” along the chain would be approved ahead of time – “there’s never any like, ‘surprise!'” Birla said – but once the software is set up and deployed, the hops themselves happen “in milliseconds.”Another improvement, which is aimed specifically at customers not opting to integrate xRapid, is known as “bulk FX” (short for foreign exchange). This feature allows customers to buy fiat currencies in bulk, letting them pre-fund foreign bank accounts all at once and provide customers with a consistent exchange rate.A third feature, known as “enhanced onward forwarding,” links xCurrent to local payment rails, such as ACH and its equivalents. That way – in contrast to SWIFT – financial institutions are better able to verify that the payment makes it to the end recipient.Finally, the new version of xCurrent includes user interface updates that Birla said would make configuring the software less confusing.xCurrent 4.0 includes a number of enhancements, but cryptocurrency investors are paying attention mainly because enhanced xRapid integration could boost XRP adoption by institutions.In the first couple of months since the new version’s roll-out, however, no new firms have publicly embraced a product promising “on-demand liquidity.”Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse image via Ripple/YouTube"

Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) have been the center of many high-level discussions, notably at the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).The breadth of reports from experienced central bankers validates blockchain technology in a way that crypto-anarchists, armchair blockchain economists, and even millennials that got smoked by buying cryptocurrencies last Thanksgiving (2017), can collectively be proud of.However, the cruel reality is that consumer adoption of new retail payment innovations is often difficult – whether that innovation is magic internet money or new Sacagawea U.S. dollar coins. Further, just as payment habits with physical cash, credit card, or cell phone use varies from country to country, different regional consumer preferences regarding anonymity, fees or interest payments would persist with a digital manifestation of “physical cash.”New technologies are cool, but the road to adoption is treacherous – history is littered with the decomposed debris of failed payment innovations that did not provide what consumers wanted.Successful and wide-scale CBDC implementation would require architects to consider consumer demand, payment habits, and preferences within a particular country – possibly resulting in idiosyncratic design decisions.Adding to the growing discourse on the topic, in a recent research report for R3, JP Koning evaluates what a CBDC might look like if it were to be issued by the central bank of Brazil, the world’s eighth largest economy.While this paper anchors the analysis through specific treatment of the Brazilian market, many of the design decisions that central banks (or private sector companies on behalf of central banks) would have to make can be generalized to other economies as well.Building on his earlier work, JP questions whether CBDCs should be in bearer form or account-based, whether they should be private like physical cash or have identities tied to transactions (and to what extent), and whether CBDCs should pay interest or not.He presents three potential high-level archetypes for a CBDC: a cash-like digital bearer instrument; an account at the central bank; or a hybrid approach that combines features of cash and accounts.Thus far, central bank innovation teams have done incredible work with blockchain technology.Project Jasper’s Phase 3 white paper, a collaborative effort between Payments Canada, the Bank of Canada, TMX Group, Accenture and R3, required coordination amongst many different stakeholders –the breadth of analysis and innovative thinking shows in the end result.The recent report on creative approaches to cross-border settlement systems by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), the Bank of England, and the Bank of Canada is a must-read for payment nerds. A report on decentralized liquidity savings mechanisms, a result of a Project Ubin prototype built for the MAS, shows the promise of decentralized netting.The focus on wholesale, or interbank payments, thus far, is entirely merited as these projects are more contained in scope and may provide more concrete benefits to market participants, at least in the short term.Yet while progress with wholesale payments is great, retail, or consumer, payments are also ripe for innovation.Despite the persistence of and even increases in the amount of physical cash in some regions, consumers globally are trending towards digital payment use.Building digital solutions on top of existing financial market infrastructure may only enable private sector-led retail-level payment innovations to get so far.Existing underlying payment infrastructures in several regions can lead to interoperability and access limitations and complexities.Future innovation with platforms backed by central bank-issued money, if done with a responsible and careful architecture, has the potential to better serve payment niches that are either currently poorly addressed by the private sector, or fill the future gap left by paper’s inevitable decline in the wake of more digital payment volume.A “big bang” move to cryptocurrencies may be (nearly) impossible, but a premeditated and deliberate phased rollout of a CBDC is not only possible, but it may be what certain types of consumers in certain types of regions need.Piggy banks image via Shutterstock"

The transaction data is then stored, while a new transaction and digital signature are generated using a private key. The new transaction data, which would contain the destination address and the payment amount, would be sent on.The method “would result in showing the user only transferring funds to and receiving funds from a small number of addresses that are also involved in a significantly large volume of transactions with various other users, thereby rendering the data innocuous,” the filing states.The amounts too may also be hidden through the use of multiple transfers using multiple addresses.The application goes on to note that blockchain platforms are being increasingly used to conduct transactions, with users “flocking to various digital currencies” like bitcoin.Some users prefer cryptocurrencies “for the anonymity that blockchain transactions can provide,” Mastercard says, explaining that “specifically, it is often extremely difficult to identify the user behind a blockchain address, meaning that an individual can transfer or receive funds utilizing a blockchain while keeping a high level of anonymity.”However, most blockchain ledgers are not actually anonymous. The application explicitly notes that transactions can be traced due to “the nature of the blockchain as an immutable ledger.”As a result, it’s possible to identify all of the transactions that are associated with a specific blockchain wallet using public data.Ultimately, users may be identified in this way, the patent says, explaining:“For instance, such data may, as it is accumulated and analyzed, eventually reveal the user behind a wallet or at least provide information about them … However, the existing communications and attribution structure of blockchain technology such as bitcoin require identification of where the transactions are emanating and terminating, in order to maintain the ledger.”“Thus, there is a need for a technical solution to increase the anonymization of a wallet and the user associated therewith in a blockchain,” the application concludes.The patent application echoes comments made by proponents of privacy-focused cryptocurrencies like monero and zcash, both of which incorporate features to hide the source or destination for transactions, as well as the total amount being transferred.While users may prefer anonymity when conducting transactions, the prominence of coins like monero and zcash has risen enough that government agencies like the U.S. Department of Homeland Security are looking for ways to trace funds sent through the privacy coins.The agency published a pre-solicitation document earlier this week which included a proposal for studying forensic analysis techniques to track privacy coin transactions.Mastercard image via Alexander Yakimov/Shutterstock"

We are still investigating whether this code vulnerability was ever exploited against Copay users,”The firm is asking users to not run or open the Copay wallet if they are using versions from 5.0.2 to 5.1.0. It has now released an updated version (5.2.0) without the malicious code for all Copay and BitPay wallet users that will be available in app stores “momentarily.”BitPay stressed: “Users should assume that private keys on affected wallets may have been compromised, so they should move funds to new wallets (v5.2.0) immediately.”Bitpay has also advised users to not move any funds to new wallets by importing their 12-word backup phrases, since they correspond to “potentially compromised private keys.”“Users should first update their affected wallets (5.0.2-5.1.0) and then send all funds from affected wallets to a brand new wallet on version 5.2.0, using the Send Max feature to initiate transactions of all funds,” it explained.The attack appears to have been carried out by a supposed developer called Right9ctrl who took over maintenance of the NodeJS library from its author who no longer had time for the work, ZDNet reports. The social engineering attack occurred about three months ago when Right9ctrl was granted access to the repository, at which point they injected the malware.Jackson Palmer, the creator of the dogecoin cryptocurrency, tweeted in response to the news: “This is one of the major issues with JavaScript-based cryptocurrency wallets with heavy up-stream dependencies coming from NPM. BitPay essentially trusted all the up-stream developers to never inject malicious code into their wallet. ”Code image via Shutterstock"

Mainly, it manipulates the needed files and creates a dependency which is critical during emulation.”As a result of these tactics, the malware is also being detected by security systems at “significantly” reduced rates.The malware usually targets Microsoft servers (predominantly IIS\SQL) and while configured to harness 75 percent of the victim machine’s CPU capacity for mining, it actually uses up the full 100 percent.To preserve its secrecy, KingMiner is also seen to use a private mining pool to avoid detection, which also has its API switched off.“We have not yet determined which domains are used, as this is also private. However, we can see that the attack is currently widely spread, from Mexico to India, Norway and Israel,” the researchers said.The continual changes allow the malware to be more successful, they continued, predicting that such evasion techniques will continue to evolve during 2019 and become more common across crypto-mining malware variants.Virus illustration via Shutterstock "

Research. News; Learn; Research. Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Dec 4, 2018 at 22:00 UTC","Numerai never did a token sale, but people have its token and they are using it.","The numeraire (NMR) was launched in June 2017 as an early departure from the initial coin offering (ICO) template. Now, with the final upgrade of the company’s smart contract on ethereum, the maximum supply of tokens will drop from 21 million to 11 million, and the company will throw away the keys to the contract controlling its supply.“We are going to be decentralized as fuck,” Numerai founder Richard Craib told CoinDesk in an interview.Craib argues this has always been the plan, but the move dovetails nicely with comments by U.S. regulators suggesting widely-used tokens that no one company controls are viewed more favorably.When CoinDesk asked Craib if the company has been in touch with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission about its business model, he declined to comment. Regardless, Craib seemed relieved that his company never opted to do an ICO. Rather, NMR tokens were distributed via airdrops and as payments to users of its platform.“I think from a securities perspective the key question is whether or not the SEC will go after a company that only did an airdrop, rather than an ICO,” said Margaret Rosenfeld, the blockchain practice lead at law firm Smith Anderson.Craib doesn’t dispute that Numerai has been centralized up till now.Numerai started as a marketplace for data that its hedge fund could use to make investments. With the full debut of Erasure, its software on ethereum, Numerai will open up that marketplace to any fund that wants to incorporate other people’s work.Numerai dates back to 2015. It was founded as a hedge fund that wanted to give data analysts a better way to sell good data analysis. To date, Numerai has been using its software to let data scientists crunch numbers for Numerai’s own benefit, but Erasure will let anyone making predictions prove their track record.Today, even with only one customer, there are 25,000 stakes of NMR, according to the company, making it ethereum’s most-used token.What’s striking about the recent decentralization announcement, though, is the company’s decision not only to turn the software over to NMR holders but to mint significantly fewer tokens than originally planned.According to Craib, if Erasure is meant to bring in lots of new participants, then it’s important to cut off the new supply of NMR.Craib explained:“We had to be sure those people didn’t have to trust Numerai not to mint a whole bunch of tokens.”But there’s a lingering question: why move so quickly?“Nothing we are doing now is a reactionary thing,” Craib told CoinDesk. He added that he believes the SEC’s priority has been to take on ICOs that went too far.That said, we’ve already seen one project, Stream, decide to pull its ICO because the firm didn’t think it could do it legally, and then shut down entirely when it didn’t believe it could even do an airdrop.Nevertheless, Craib seems confident that turning the protocol over to NMR holders will be enough.Rosenfeld, the Smith Anderson lawyer, was not so sure. She said the SEC will look at everything the company has done with the token, not just what it’s doing once it has completely decentralized. The “taint of a security” doesn’t just go away in the eyes of the SEC, she said.Still, she added: “[U.S. regulators] haven’t yet gone after a company that has just done an airdrop.”So far, NMR payments have been issued to users by way of a weekly analysis tournament. Competing analysts had to use NMR to stake their work. It was a way of expressing confidence in their models. If their analysis proved right, bigger stakes got bigger NMR rewards.If their work was bad enough, scientists could lose their stake, but lost stakes didn’t go back to Numerai, Craib explained. Lost stakes just got burnt.On Erasure, users will be able to prove that they’ve made good predictions on a given dataset over time and sell those predictions to anyone who thinks their fund can make good use of it.Similar to the existing system, analysts will need to stake their predictions to express confidence. Buyers can pay to destroy their stake if they get frustrated with a predictor.Joshua Gans, an economist at the University of Toronto, doesn’t buy the staking approach on Erasure, but its community won’t have to stick to it. With the launch of Erasure, NMR will also become a governance token. Holders can vote to approve a better approach to managing spammy datasets if a better approach comes along.What they won’t be able to do is vote to increase the token supply, as that smart contract will be shut down for good.With Erasure’s launch, the supply of NMR tokens will rise by almost half again.How that happens could be a key question for regulators. The company is not revealing how that last lot of tokens (over 50 percent of the existing supply) will be distributed.According to Numerai, there are currently about 7 million NMR in existence. CoinMarketCap pegs that number at 2.3 million. Craib says the difference is largely explained by the fact that the company locked up 3 million tokens for a decade in May, but that still leaves 1.7 million unaccounted for.“I don’t really know where CoinMarketCap gets their information,” Craib wrote CoinDesk in an email.In Erasure’s early days, “Numerai will be one of the biggest purchasers of data feeds, for the time being,” Craib projected, but he believes it is inevitable that other hedge funds will begin scouring it for predictions.“It’s fundamentally going to be a token about users and usage,” he said.Numerals image via Shutterstock"

lot of ...","Nov 28, 2018 at 22:50 UTC","The tea leaves were swirling Tuesday after Jay Clayton, chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, dropped some hints about what regulators in the United States will (and won’t) do in the crypto space in the coming months and years.","Clayton gave a fireside chat in front of a packed room at CoinDesk’s Consensus: Invest event in Manhattan yesterday afternoon. And while Clayton made it clear that he has given cryptocurrency a lot of thought over the last year, there was still plenty to read between the lines, including his thoughts on the exchange ecosystem and the question of when ICO-derived tokens count as securities.Following the on-stage conversation, three longtime experts in crypto law dissected the nuances of what Clayton said during a taping of CoinDesk Live (which you can watch below). We were joined by Caitlin Long, of the Wyoming Blockchain Coalition; Stephen Palley, of law firm Anderson Kill; and Lewis Cohen, of DLx Law.While this panel of experts touched on a range of issues, there were some major takeaways to glean from Clayton’s talk. Here’s what they said:Perhaps first and foremost, it doesn’t seem like that the SEC will greenlight a bitcoin exchange-traded fund anytime soon.“I know there are a lot of folks who would love to have the ETF approved but I don’t think that’s very likely,” Long said. She pointed to third-party custody of crypto assets and market manipulation as two stated stumbling blocks for an exchange-traded fund. On custody, Long critiqued the rule itself, saying: “I think there’s a real question as to whether a custodian is needed if all the assets are actually sitting on a blockchain.”Clayton made it very clear that he did not trust existing crypto exchanges to prevent price manipulation.The panel noted that Clayton seemed to hint that some kind of move to get bitcoin onto a regulated exchange may be underway, with panelists pointing to remarks made earlier in the day by New York Stock Exchange Chairman Jeff Sprecher.But Cohen argued that bitcoin is a “wild beast” and regulators may not appreciate how hard it could be to tame.To further tame crypto, Clayton also made it clear that anti-money laundering protections had to be put in place for crypto trading.Palley wondered what the implications of that push might hold for the body of retail investors that are active in the market today.“My question is this,” said Palley. “There’s a lot of institutional money here. If you regulate it and you have market surveillance, will retail interest remain the same?”Borrowing a term she credited to Andreas Antonopoulos, Long described that future as one for “CorpoCoin,” adding:“What’s going to happen if this becomes too corporatized, is the crypto community will just fork off.”Repeating a theme Clayton stressed in his talk, Cohen argued it would behoove crypto startups that raised money in 2017 and early 2018 to go to the regulators now.Paraphrasing Clayton, Cohen said: “Those that come see us may get one deal, those we come find may get another.”Earlier this month the SEC issued its first civil penalties to two startups that did not properly register their securities offerings. With those “templates” in hand, Palley said, the SEC might be getting ready to move much faster on ICOs.One of Clayton’s messages from the stage was that the SEC’s doors are open to startups working in the industry, particularly those that are issuing their own tokens. To this end, the agency recently launched a new fintech-focused division with the explicit goal of fostering communication with ICO startups.The panel agreed that what startups in this space want are so-called “no-action” letters (letters in which the SEC confirms that it will not move against a company based on its business model).The letters have long been expected, but no startups have received one yet, according to Long.“If that’s what [Clayton] really wants, for people to come get no-action letters, the U.S. is already behind and we’re gonna fall even further behind,” she said.While regulators are already on it, there’s another frontier for determining the validity of new funding mechanisms for blockchain startups.As Palley asked: “What are courts going to do when they start parsing through token sales?” In fact, it’s already starting to happen.Maybe in 10 years – or perhaps even less – Palley said, the U.S. Supreme Court may take a look.Broadly speaking, Clayton argued from the stage that the SEC is happy to help crypto startups in the U.S. find a way to get in compliance with the law, but our panel of regulatory experts said that, in practice, this turns out to be much more difficult (and costly) than the chairman made it sound.Click the link below to watch the full CoinDesk LIVE panel:Unpacking Jay Clayton's remarks on #CoinDeskLIVE #ConsensusInvest https://t.co/YyiF2Ah2Qo— CoinDesk (@coindesk) November 27, 2018 Photo by Noelle Acheson"

Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Nov 27, 2018 at 13:00 UTC",A group of 10 companies focused on cryptocurrencies and financial services have formed a new group aimed at standardizing a code of conduct for the still-nascent digital asset space.,"Announced Tuesday, the Association for Digital Market Assets, or ADAM, is backed by founding members Galaxy Digital, Genesis Global Trading, GSR, Hudson River Trading, Paxos, Symbiont, BitOoda Technologies, BTIG, Cumberland and XBTO.Together, the companies are pitching conduct voluntary rules to cover the areas of efficient trading, custody, clearing and digital asset settlement, with future guidelines planned to “encourage professionalism and ethical conduct.”To that end, ADAM plans to work with regulators with the ultimate goal of both aiding existing laws and regulations, as well as earning the trust of both financial watchdogs and policymakers.And while the group may appear to be setting out to be a self-regulatory organization (SRO), spokesperson Seth London said it isn’t aiming for that designation just yet.“ADAM must earn the trust of market participants and regulators before it can discuss the SRO designation with regulators and governments that have power to appoint SROs,” he told CoinDesk in an email. He added, though:“The historical parallels to creation of many SROs mirrors the path that ADAM aims to follow.”“Currently ADAM includes a wide variety of market participants, including trading platforms, custodians, investors, asset managers, traders, liquidity providers and brokers,” he continued. “Its members are all firms that are active in digital asset markets or seek to participate in those markets once rules are standardized.”In the coming weeks, ADAM intends to announce its officers and add new members. The group is also in the process of setting up organizational governance.“In Q1 2019, ADAM intends to convene its members, advisors and regulatory experts to begin drafting the code of conduct. That will take several months. Once the code is adopted, ADAM will exist to evolve it as necessary and monitor compliance,” London added.In a statement, ADAM advisory board member and former New York Stock Exchange CEO Duncan Niederauer said “rules are fundamental to the development of any market.”In particular, organizations that can both clarify how existing rules apply to the ecosystem and help increase trust in it are necessary for the crypto markets, he said.The announcement comes after a group of crypto exchanges teamed up with Gemini founders Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss to launch a new industry-focused self-regulatory organization (SRO) in August. That group, proposed back in March, notably received backing from CFTC Commissioner Brian Quintenz.Michael Novogratz image via Consensus"

Research. News; Learn; Research. Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Nov 26, 2018 at 22:00 UTC","Civil was supposed to create a more transparent and democratic model for journalism. But so far, journalists working on its platform have yet to receive all of the compensation they say they were promised when hired.","According to several current and former employees of news organizations sponsored by the blockchain startup, Civil told journalists in 14 newsrooms around the U.S. that the CVL cryptocurrency – which, when issued, was supposed to comprise part of their pay – would probably end up being worth several times more than the estimated valuations mentioned in meetings and reported in tax forms.Yet lackluster demand caused Civil to cancel a public sale of the tokens last month. Now, the reporters have no idea if or when they’ll be paid the tokens that were supposed to be part of their compensation.Meanwhile, the platform, conceived as a collaborative network where readers would pay for quality journalism and journalists would earn money for content, remains unfinished. The newsrooms, which employ dozens of journalists, are operating normally, but without the tokens originally meant to provide a compelling value-add for users.“Civil can talk all it wants about creating a new future for media, but the reality is it’s being built by putting journalists into debt,” said Jay Cassano, who left the Civil news outlet Sludge on Nov. 8 because, he said, undelivered tokens made up roughly 70 percent of his salary for five months.“I had to borrow money to pay my rent and student loans,” Cassano told CoinDesk.Civil CEO Matt Iles disputes the current and former employees’ claims.“We didn’t promise anyone tokens would be worth any specific amount,” he told CoinDesk. “Anytime we discussed potential token value with newsrooms, we made it clear we were making estimates and that there was risk involved.”Iles counters that Civil took steps to discourage the kind of frenzied buying that could have driven up the price of CVL, had the tokens been issued publicly. He told CoinDesk:“Civil’s consumer token framework restricts liquidity and volatility as a means to ward off speculators and ensure that people buying CVL do so because they want to participate in the network.”Indeed, Civil used a rigorous know-your-customer process and partnership with the exchange startup AirSwap, which created a means to restrict access to CVL purchases.But according to Cassano and other insiders, employees were told a different story about the expected price of CVL.Specifically, according to Cassano, Civil told reporters working with its sponsored news operations that the CVL token they would be partially paid in could be worth around $0.75.However, on tax documents, the tokens were valued at a fraction of a penny. Iles would not comment on that difference.“They kept hyping it up internally to keep us in line, saying they were even going to exceed that valuation,” Cassano said. “Iles, at one point, said he expected the tokens to double or quadruple in value compared to what was written in our contracts.”A second Civil reporter, who still works at one of the newsrooms sponsored by the startup, told CoinDesk the startup’s leadership “absolutely” talked up the token’s growth potential to employees.“The expectation was they were going to be able to get rich off of it,” the source said.According to this insider, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, days before the token sale flopped, Civil addressed reporters’ concerns about it by saying that crypto “whales” would buy up unclaimed tokens to help the startup reach its threshold goal.Iles denied making any promises but acknowledged that the company tried to get large buyers involved when the sale languished.“As the sale wound down, it was obvious to everyone that the only way to meet the goal would be to attract large-scale token buyers… of course we were still working hard to bring in major buyers during the final days,” Iles said. “We communicated our ongoing efforts on this front, but there was never any promise or guarantee made.”The failed token sale forced Civil to refund “purchasers” $8 million, including $1.1 million worth of CVL purchased in September by the partner company ConsenSys, which is spearheaded by Civil’s primary investor, Joe Lubin.While Iles confirmed that Lubin was promptly reimbursed, reporters at Civil newsrooms say they don’t know if they will ever receive the token portion of their compensation packages.Iles confirmed a Quartz report that he will eventually own 5 million CVL, whenever they are distributed.As for when that is expected to happen, Cassano and an insider say they haven’t been given a timetable, despite Iles’ statement to the contrary.“We’ve communicated target dates to the newsrooms and plan to confirm details in the next few weeks,” Iles said. “We will not share those dates publicly before speaking to them.”Furthermore, Iles said Civil has an active GitHub project for an open-source application and publishing platform, often garnering dozens of contributions a week.The controversy about employee compensation at Civil raises different legal questions than those that usually come up in the discussion of tokens, which usually center around whether initial coin offerings (ICOs) are unregistered securities.Preston Byrne, a partner at the law firm Byrne & Storm, P.C., told CoinDesk that different laws might apply to private offerings via employee contracts rather than strictly public offerings.“There are things that you can be given or possess that increase in value but aren’t a security,” Byrne said. “You’ve got to pay your people and you’ve got to be honest with them, otherwise different questions arise.”Byrne also added that the legal questions surrounding tokens will be driven by specific facts and circumstances. In the case of CVL, the public buyers were reimbursed, meaning Civil may not have anything to worry about from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or from “purchasers.”“There is a provision in the securities laws that allows anyone that has participated in a sale of unregistered securities [to] extinguish its liability to those persons by affording them the right to rescind,” Byrne said.He concluded:“With regards to employees, it depends on how they acquired the thing and whether they are deemed to be part of the offering.”Newspaper via ShutterstockCorrection: This article has been updated to reflect that, although there are 18 newsrooms that plan to receive CVL tokens, so far only 14 have grant agreements with Civil."

Signature Bank claims that all transactions made will be secure, require no transaction fees and avoid third-parties, meaning funds will be sent directly from one client to another.There will, however, be a minimum account balance requirement of $250,000 for clients.The platform is being built in conjunction with trueDigital Holdings LLC, another New York-based firm focused on building exchange and settlement technology using a blockchain infrastructure. The company primarily provides services to financial markets.Signature has just received approval from the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) to offer services within the state. Further, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) has approved Signet deposits to receive insurance, “up to the legal insurable amounts.”In a statement, Signature president and CEO Joseph DePaolo said it was “gratifying” to receive approval from NYDFS, saying that regulated innovation helped the bank build up its platform.He added:“The ability to transmit funds between approved, fully vetted commercial clients of the Bank at all times is very valuable, especially in light of the increasing speed and frequency at which they conduct their business. As we have been stating, Signature Bank has made a commitment to invest in its technology infrastructure, and the Signet Platform is indicative of this investment along with the implementation of new systems for loan operations, credit approvals and foreign exchange.”Scott Shay, chairman of Signature Bank’s board, explained that a number of industries benefit from real-time transactions, including energy distribution and over-the-counter trading desks.“Signet puts Signature Bank on the cutting edge of commercial digital payments,” he added.Dollars image via Shutterstock"

Research. News; Learn; Research. Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Dec 5, 2018 at 10:00 UTC","Researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), one of the top-five hospitals in the US, are collaborating with Korean blockchain startup MediBloc in an effort to find better ways to store and share patient data.","Synho Do, director of the Laboratory of Medical Imaging and Computation by MGH and Harvard Medical School, told CoinDesk that the laboratory is expanding research in a range of areas “from medical image analysis to health information exchange by leveraging our cutting-edge technologies such as blockchain, artificial intelligence and machine learning.”Regarding this specific initiative, Do added:“In collaboration with Medibloc, we aim to explore potentials of blockchain technology to provide secure solutions for health information exchange, integrate healthcare AI applications into the day-to-day clinical workflow, and support [a] data sharing and labeling platform for machine learning model development.”Through a spokesperson, Do later emphasized that the hospital isn’t using any real patient data for its research but rather simulated data.The trouble with patient data is that multiple entities – hospitals, research bodies, insurance and pharmaceutical companies – need the information about those that are receiving medical help. But currently, they’re all keeping their own data that can’t be shared securely and often is in various incompatible formats.“Every day, when people go to hospitals, lots of information is created, but it’s difficult to transfer it from one hospital to another,” Allen Wookyun Kho, MediBloc’s founder and CEO, told CoinDesk.He added that MediBloc is not only developing a distributed ledger for storing and sharing medical data, but also working on a tool that would convert data now held by hospitals from existing formats to a universal one.A range of blockchain startups have been working on enabling fast and secure transmission of healthcare data. But team-ups with actual major medical institutions such as the lab at MGH – which U.S. News and World Report ranked No.4 in the country in its most recent annual survey – are rare.The reason they are rare is that to share the data, hospitals need full access to it from IT vendors designing data systems for them, said Kamran Khan, CEO of blockchain startup Translo, which also is working on a system for health data within Harvard Innovation Labs.The vendors, in turn, are not motivated to let this information out of the silos they designed, which is why hospitals have different electronic healthcare systems with different codes, and even within one hospital, there can be several systems for different kind of diseases.Khan told CoinDesk:“Even in Boston, there are 27 different systems for only 17 hospitals, and they lack interoperability. This is done on purpose: once the data is out of the siloed system, the hospital can create their own system.”This is why, to create a new system, a hospital needs to persuade its vendor to provide full access to the data in the existing one and to be really convinced itself that the new system will benefit the institution.MediBloc, however, has had notable success in getting partners, at least in Asia; according to Kho, now eight medical institutions across the region and 14 tech companies, including Deloitte Anjin LLC, Deloitte’s Korean branch, have signed up to test MediBloc’s system.Dawn Lee, the startup’s business development manager, told CoinDesk that the company got the South Korean government’s attention as one of the first blockchain companies to run an initial coin offering (ICO) in Korea, in December 2017.This, and the fact that MediBloc’s founders, Kho and Eunsol Lee, are doctors, helped to develop relationships with government officials and actual hospitals.As a result, it was selected as a provider of blockchain technology for two government-funded projects, with Bundang Seoul National University and Seoul St. Mary’s Hospital, Lee said.That record of working with big medical institutions led the Laboratory of Medical Imaging and Computation to approach MediBloc, she said. “The MGH Lab came across our company, we started talking in early spring, signed a deal in summer and we’ve just started the research.”MediBloc’s main focus now is building an ecosystem upon which other startups can build their apps for various ways to use and exchange health data.A testing environment version of the blockchain was launched in August, the network is expected to go live before the end of the year and become fully functional in the second quarter of 2019, Kho said. MediBloc’s public blockchain will use the delegated proof of stake consensus method and is currently relying on 10 nodes — on the mainnet, the number will be 21, Kho said.There are also apps in the works by MediBloc planned to go live in the first half of 2019. One of them, currently in a beta testing phase with 300 users, is designed for patients to sell the information about their symptoms and the prescriptions they get to MediBloc. After that MediBloc will analyze that data and sell the analysis to pharmaceutical and insurance companies.In the future, users will be able to sell or share their data directly to the buyers, without MediBloc as an intermediary, Kho told CoinDesk.The main goal of this all is to let patients independently decide what to do with their information.“We make patients the mediums of their own data,” Lee concluded.Massachusetts General Hospital image via Shutterstock"

to purchase tokens too. Harbor will escrow the cryptocurrencies ...","Nov 27, 2018 at 14:00 UTC",Blockchain startup Harbor has officially launched its security token compliance platform and is moving to offer digitized shares in a high-rise building located in in South Carolina.,"Announced Tuesday at CoinDesk’s Consensus: Invest event, Harbor is now allowing investors to register to buy shares in apartment block called The Hub at Columbia, owned by the real-estate wing of DRW Holdings, Convexity Properties. There are 955 shares – represented by 955 tokens – available at a cost of $21,000 apiece.The company, which raised $28 million earlier this year, develops ERC-20 tokens, an ethereum standard, for companies that want to put up equity or other forms of interest by way of a tokenized offering.Harbor CEO Josh Stein told CoinDesk that the company’s platform allows it to track security token trading and investors’ real-world identity in real-time, ensuring that token sales are “compliant every time, everywhere.”Offerings on Harbor’s security token platform operate similarly to a normal private placement sale, he explained. The key difference comes from the platform’s use of a blockchain protocol and structure, which allow companies to tap into a wider pool of investors.Typically, an offering like Convexity’s might be sold to 10 or 20 investors, each of whom would have to contribute a significantly larger chunk of the total funding. Harbor’s platform makes it easier for anywhere from 100 to 2,000 accredited investors to participate, allowing each a $21,000 minimum stake, which is smaller than the norm.The 2,000 investor limit is a regulatory one as well – companies with a higher number of investors must go public.An interested investor can sign up on a dedicated website, where they’ll be redirected to Harbor to fill out a know-your-customer (KYC) form. The portal will require investors to share identifying information and upload a copy of a driver’s license, as well as upload documents proving income and assets for accreditation, Stein said, adding:“The KYC happens in just a couple of minutes. The accreditation, verification of assets and income, takes … 1–3 days for an individual and 2–12 days for an entity and the reason why is you have to peel back the layers and [verify accreditation for individuals in the entity].”Once an investor is approved, they can sign the documents purchasing the tokens electronically.On the token side, an external security firm audits the smart contract and a “Big Four” accounting firm will monitor the payment flows, Stein said.Unlike other private placement sales, investors can use bitcoin or ethereum to purchase tokens too. Harbor will escrow the cryptocurrencies without converting them unless necessary, allowing for refunds without requiring conversion fees, Stein added.To that end, the company is working with BitGo to custody any crypto assets received.The offering means that investors are able to participate in sales alongside major operators. In Convexity’s case, its parent company DRW owns a little more than 50 percent of the interest in The Hub.Should investors wish to trade or sell their shares, they can do so after 90 days – another departure from traditional private placement sales, which locks them in for a greater period of time. Stein said, “You can pull your investment if you feel like it.”He further likened the shift from traditional securities trading to the shift from writing letters to writing email. Using the internet to send messages proved to be far more efficient than writing and posting letters, he noted, saying:“Now blockchain, like email, offers us a world that’s faster, cheaper and easier by an order of magnitude.”Josh Stein image via Consensus"

While the document notes that there are both commercial and government uses for crypto, the topic specifically focuses on finding a way to conduct forensic analysis on privacy-focused coins if they are used for criminal activity.In the document, DHS highlights that platforms such as zcash and monero emphasize privacy and anonymity as key features, making it difficult to determine where a transaction originates or how much is sent.“While these features are desirable, there is similarly a compelling interest in tracing and understanding transactions and actions on the blockchain of an illegal nature,” it reads.From the document:“This proposal calls for solutions that enable law enforcement investigations to perform forensic analysis on blockchain transactions. This analysis can be approached in any number of ways and may consider different data situation use cases depending on whether additional data from off-chain sources are available.”While the document cites zcash and monero as two examples of privacy-focused cryptocurrencies, it also notes that new platforms can be developed with similar features. As such, any proposed solution would have to either be applicable more generally or “provide working approaches to treating newer blockchain implementations.”The file outlines three phases such a proposal would follow.The document notes that it is neither a solicitation nor a Request for Proposals, meaning the agency is not looking for specific solutions at this time. Rather, interested parties can contact topic authors until Dec. 18 to either provide a comment or ask technical questions.

regulation, and the costs of compliance, would chill startup activity.","Dec 8, 2018 at 11:00 UTC","Kevin Werbach is a Professor of Legal Studies & Business Ethics at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, and the author of “The Blockchain and the New Architecture of Trust,” from which this article is adapted.","_______In 2015, New York became one of the first jurisdictions in the world to adopt a regulatory regime for cryptocurrencies. The Department of Financial Services began requiring virtual currency businesses to obtain a “BitLicense” in order to operate or serve customers in the state.“We want to promote and support companies that use new, emerging technologies to build better financial companies,” said then-New York Superintendent of Financial Services Ben Lawsky, when announcing the rules. He continued:“Regulators are not always going to get the balance precisely right…. But we need to begin somewhere.”Perhaps. Yet Lawsky picked the wrong somewhere. And he moved fast to formalize rules governing what was still, in 2015, a small-scale and fluid cryptocurrency community.Bitcoin entrepreneurs and technologists argued that the threat of overbroad regulation, and the costs of compliance, would chill startup activity. More than 4,000 comments were filed on the draft rule, most of them critical.And when the regulations went into effect, a substantial number of Bitcoin-related startups left New York, including the exchanges Kraken, Shapeshift, Bitfinex, and Poloniex. “The ‘Great Bitcoin Exodus’ has totally changed New York’s Bitcoin ecosystem,” declared the New York Business Journal.Three years after the Great Bitcoin Exodus, the crypto-native exchanges have not rejoined the New York startup scene. But other firms have.R3, the financial industry distributed ledger consortium with over $100 million in funding, is headquartered in New York. As one might expect, so are a number of finance-focused blockchain startups such as Digital Asset Holdings, Symbiont, and Axoni. Pillars of Wall Street such as Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, and the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange are getting into the action.And the activity is not limited to financial services. Consensys, a venture development studio building around Ethereum technology, grew from 100 to over 400 employees during 2017 alone in its Brooklyn headquarters, and is working on dozens of innovative projects around the world (though it recently announced significant layoffs). Blockstack, a high-profile startup hoping to build “a new internet for decentralized apps” on blockchain foundations, is located in New York as well. The New York bitcoin and ethereum meetup groups each have over five thousand members.The BitLicense, for all its flaws, did not kill off cryptocurrency activity in New York. Neither did it create the model for regulatory innovation its creators intended. Subsequent jurisdictions developing cryptocurrency regulatory frameworks explicitly distinguished their policies from the overly restrictive elements of the BitLicense.Stepping back, in fast-moving areas, regulators inevitably face a dilemma.If they move too soon, and subject new technologies to old rules without good cause, they risk killing off innovation or pushing it to other jurisdictions. If they wait too long, the public will be harmed, and the costs of imposing requirements on now-substantial industries will become even greater.Where regulators see clear evidence of the harms they were established to prevent, they will need to act. Unclear requirements like the BitLicense create uncertainty, but so does the absence of any definitive regulatory statement. Smart regulators can encourage innovation even as they protect against abuses.When in 1994 the Federal Communications Commission received a petition to ban “the provision of…telecommunications service via the ‘internet’ by non-tariffed, uncertified entities,” it faced a challenge similar to New York confronting Bitcoin in 2013. The voice over internet protocol (VOIP) startups springing up to provide services were not subject to the pricing, universal service contribution, consumer protection, emergency services, and other requirements that traditional phone companies faced.The FCC managed to steer a course between chilling innovation and abandoning its mission, gradually bringing VOIP services within a set of obligations as they matured. Today, a majority of Americans who have landline phones in their homes use VOIP technology, without even knowing it. At the same time, real-time voice and video messaging on services such as Skype, Facetime, and WhatsApp has been a hotbed of innovation and adoption, with offerings that look very different than traditional phone service.If regulators can follow the FCC model, they will support the realization of the full potential of cryptocurrencies.Disruptive startups are not necessarily on the side of deregulation. For example, when Microsoft used its monopoly power in the late 1990s to threaten web-based services, the U.S. government intervened through antitrust enforcement to restrain it.The internet might look very different today if there were no independent market for Web browsers, or if Microsoft had implemented its plan to charge a small fee on all e-commerce transactions, leveraging its hammerlock control over the desktop.Moreover, the knowledge that governments were operating to police abusive practices helped promote trust in the new and unfamiliar word of virtual transactions, whether in form of PayPal transfers, Amazon sales, or Netflix subscriptions. In time, internet advocates began to call for government intervention to enforce network neutrality rules, which prevented broadband access providers from discriminating against unaffiliated services, and privacy protections.To be sure, there are important questions about where to draw lines around surveillance and permissible uses of technology.Criminals and terrorists will try to exploit the blockchain, just as they exploit other technologies whenever possible. Governments will over-react, and propose rules with collateral damage to legitimate operations.The point is that these are not new challenges. Calls for regulation do not represent the end of cryptocurrency innovation; they signal the blockchain’s ongoing maturation.Contrary to what he/she/they or anyone else might think, Satoshi Nakamoto did not create a trustless technology. Cryptocurrencies and other blockchain-based systems eliminate certain costly trust relationships, but they do so to make the transactions themselves even more trustworthy. Hundreds of billions of dollars in cryptocurrency market capitalization based on nothing but the collective belief of independent network participants might be the greatest self-generation of trust in history.The law, and its siblings regulation and governance, are often viewed as a heavy-handed enforcement mechanism. The goal of that enforcement, however, is not to punish. It is to open up freedom of action by setting the rules of the game.A referee gives a red card for a hand ball in a soccer match not to stop an innovative form of play, but to protect the integrity of the game. Fraud, theft, criminal activity, unjustified regulatory arbitrage, governance failures, corruption, and manipulation are the major impediments to growing blockchain and cryptocurrency markets.If you want to change the world, and do so sustainably, law and regulation are your friends.Bird cage image via Shutterstock"

Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Nov 29, 2018 at 14:00 UTC","ConsenSys Labs has led a $2.1 million seed round for AZTEC, a startup that’s working to make ethereum transactions private so financial institutions can comfortably use the second-largest blockchain.","Announced Thursday, other investors in the round include Entrepreneur First, Samos Investments, Jeffrey Tarrant (Mov37) and Charlie Songhurst.AZTEC, created by the mathematician Tom Pocock and nuclear physicist Zachary Williamson, uses zero-knowledge proofs (also known as zk-SNARKs), the cryptographic technique popularized by the zcash currency, to enhance privacy on a shared ledger. But the startup claims its protocol is “twice as efficient as other known technologies on the network.”The protocol is intended to be used by banks, Pocock told CoinDesk, and they will be able to utilize the tech through a partnership with CreditMint, an ethereum-based platform for corporate debt issuance and trading created by the same team as AZTEC.“We have been talking to more than 20 leading financial institutions, specializing in corporate private debt, amongst which are global top-10 banks,” Pocock said, adding that the first wave of users would be announced in January 2019. In addition to enhancing privacy, AZTEC’s tech will also help boost the speed of settlement in loan markets, the startup claims.Currently, big banks tend to gravitate towards private, permissioned blockchains like the one launched on Tuesday by CLS, with Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley as the first users. However, Pocock believes that established financial institutions would benefit from using public blockchains.He told CoinDesk:“Immutability, single-source data and elimination of settlement risk are strongest on public chains — but clearly, financial institutions demand full transaction privacy.”Until now, he said, that was not possible on ethereum’s public chain, “and therefore capital markets activity has been restricted to private blockchains.”AZTEC’s team had been in discussions with ConsenSys for several months after graduating from Entrepreneur First, the London tech accelerator, in March 2018, Pocock said.“We were impressed with the resilience of the zero-knowledge proof technology that AZTEC created. Based on what we’re seeing, AZTEC is the closest to production and the most efficient in sense of gas cost,” Min Teo, executive director at ConsenSys Labs Investments Europe, told CoinDesk, referring to the small amount of ether that must be paid to power a transaction on the blockchain.Joe Lubin, the founder of ConsenSys, said in a press release that his ethereum design studio “is proud to support this breakthrough from AZTEC and CreditMint, bringing zk-SNARKs-based privacy, confidentiality and scalability to a wide variety of asset transactions on public ethereum.”Stepping back, it remains to be seen whether a zero-knowledge proof-based system can be fast and scalable enough to suit enterprises – especially considering that even without this computationally expensive privacy enhancement, ethereum has well-known scaling challenges.But Pocock says that AZTEC’s protocol is working at a decent clip.“Without scaling we can put one transaction per second through the public network – this will be orders of magnitude faster with upcoming scaling to the network,” he told CoinDesk, referring to ethereum developers’ ongoing efforts to increase throughput on the blockchain. “Even today, it is more than sufficient for CreditMint to move the private corporate debt markets onto the public blockchain. It takes milliseconds to both construct and verify AZTEC zero-knowledge proofs.”In September, ethereum’s founder Vitalik Buterin suggested that using zk-snarks (“Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge,” a variant of zero-knowledge proofs not requiring interaction between prover and verifier) can potentially help ethereum scale up to 500 transactions per second.AZTEC is not the first effort to add privacy to the ethereum protocol by using zero-knowledge proofs: more than a year ago, JPMorgan revealed adding zk-snarks technology developed by the startup behind zcash to Quorum, the megabank’s ethereum-based private blockchain.Speaking about how that project was going, Jack Gavigan, who is responsible for product and regulatory relations at the Zcash Company, said in a video posted on the startup’s blog last month that the technology is still immature, but he hopes to see it deployed in the actual environment “within the 12 to 18 months,” with the scalability problems effectively solved.Another attempt was the October announcement of EY’s Ops Chain Public Edition prototype, which, the consulting giant said, uses zero-knowledge proofs to allow companies to create and sell “product and service tokens” on the public ethereum blockchain without disclosing their transaction records publicly.Yet another project, Adhara, also supported by ConsenSys, has been exploring zero-knowledge proof technology for an industry-grade payments mechanism of the South African Reserve Bank.According to Pocock, AZTEC is different from previous projects because it’s working on the ethereum mainnet (i.e. not a test environment or private chain) and is “significantly more efficient in terms of gas costs.”AZTEC plans to deploy additional features to boost the protocol’s efficiency during the coming months and open-source the tech, raising additional funds in the meantime, the company says.Joe Lubin image via CoinDesk archive"

Backers include venture capital firms Sequoia China, crypto mining firm F2Pool and exchange Huobi, as well as Metastable and IMO Ventures.With the new capital, the foundation said it’s now looking to expand its 10-person development team. The goal: roll out a testing environment in February and officially launch a new public blockchain around the third quarter of next year.The project was co-founded by scholars from the University of Toronto and China’s Tsinghua University, including Dr. Andrew Chi-Chih Yao, a Turing Award winner and an information sciences professor at Tsinghua. Named for renowned mathematician Alan Turing, the Turing award is given out yearly by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and is considered a kind of Nobel prize for computer science. According to an academic paper published in May, the group conducted a month-long experiment for the Conflux prototype late last year. Their efforts utilized the code of the bitcoin blockchain but changed the protocol from the Nakamoto consensus model, named for bitcoin’s creator, to Conflux’s own design.“We implemented a prototype of Conflux and evaluated Conflux by deploying up to 20k Conflux full nodes on 800 Amazon EC2 virtual machines,” the paper stated. “The throughput is equivalent to 6,400 transactions per second for typical bitcoin transactions.”In an interview with CoinDesk, Dr. Fan Long, a co-founder of the project and an assistant professor of computer science at the University of Toronto, said the key design decision that he believes could help to scale public blockchains is to change the way blocks are ordered. Currently, most blockchains work in a rather linear way in that only one block can be produced at a time and added to the end of a chain. In the event of two blocks being created at the same time, the network relies on nodes to agree on which one will continue the chain.Long said this feature of blockchain results in a bottleneck that is problematic for most public networks, especially those like ethereum that aim to power smart contracts and decentralized applications. “Some may have a higher scalability, but to some extent at the expense of a complete decentralization,” Long said.The Conflux protocol, however, is designed to allow blocks to be produced concurrently to boost the volume of transactions. But to avoid forks, or the emergence of two competing versions of the ledger, Long said the group designed an ordering algorithm based on the concept of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) that is able to make sure every block will be eventually arranged in a sequence by the network.According to Long, while the foundation utilized most of the original bitcoin blockchain code during its lab experiment, it will develop its own infrastructure for the public launch next year as the team hopes to include smart contract features.Further, the foundation said its investors will commit to using the network for future development.Long went on to say that the end goal is to create a scalable public blockchain with smart contracts that can deliver decentralized applications – and he made a sly dig at ethereum, whose scaling challenges were laid bare a year ago when CryptoKitties clogged that public blockchain network.“That goal sounds easy and similar to what every other project is saying. But it’s actually really difficult,” Long said, concluding:“Because what we need is a highly productive public network for high-value applications, not just several blockchain-based games.”Andrew Yao image courtesy of Conflux Foundation"

(though Tether also recently introduced an ERC-20 version as well).","Dec 9, 2018 at 11:00 UTC","Philippe Bekhazi is the CEO of XBTO Group, a cryptocurrency trading firm.","—The current wave of stablecoin issuances is a result of the current bear market in underlying crypto assets, leading to upwards of 50 stablecoins on offer today.Given an increasing media focus and heightened industry attention, it’s important to take both a step back and share our views on how things are likely to evolve over the next few years – arguably with the greatest velocity of change and boundless opportunities than any time since 2014.Most importantly, we’ll shine a light on what’s truly at stake as Stablecoins come of age and emerge as a crypto instrument in their own right.A stablecoin is quite simply a representation of a stable collateralized asset blockchain largely used to hedge against the decline and volatility across general crypto collateral prices, which are certainly at an amplified state.As such, they should be and generally are backed by real assets, such as a bank account backed one-for-one by U.S. dollars, euros, other fiat currencies, or even gold. They have no appreciation value and only reflect the performance of the underlying asset.They can also be used as a mechanism to move value around in stable terms, and technically even for payments, although the speed of the underlying blockchain may be a limiting factor for time-sensitive transactions, for the time being.While it may seem counterintuitive, it’s important to understand that stablecoins are crypto only by design to satisfy the tokenization process and ensure no double spend or on-chain rehypothecation takes place. Furthermore, most stablecoins, while sitting on a decentralized public blockchain, are centralized. Some simply are centralized assets representing a currency or commodity in a custodian account, while others are backed by crypto collateral or rely on algorithmic central bank style logic to create stability.One of the reasons for the recent expansion in stablecoin offerings is a lack of trust in the existing, long-term incumbent, Tether.As the first stablecoin to be created, Tether enjoyed first-mover advantage but also bore the brunt of the growing pains associated with this new endeavor. As such, it sits on the slowest blockchain and has made a few miscalculations, specifically in failing to secure a steady third-party auditor (or a credible attestation) and demonstrate a steady bank account, although it has had three proofs of reserves (attestations). This is by no means a direct slight at Tether as many crypto businesses globally have endured similar banking challenges. For all its speedbumps, Tether has proven to be very useful for the industry as a trailblazer in the space and they will continue to occupy an important part of the landscape.That said, there are naturally challengers to the incumbents, and newer entrants such a PAX, GUSD and USDC are among these next-generation stablecoins that were designed to enhance the stablecoin ecosystem, provide a “better” counterparty risk product and help take this crucial crypto cog to the next level.These aren’t the only players in town and there is room for many of the other offerings on tap. While there clearly will be some natural attrition and consolidation, many can survive and thrive due to the differentiation they bring to users, the growing pie of stablecoin stakeholders and use cases and their ability to solve for legacy technology issues.Scaling of the underlying blockchain technology is key to unlocking one of the major problems behind current offerings. Most of them sit on a relatively slow ethereum blockchain (using ERC-20 standard tokens), or in the case of Tether, the Omni protocol that sits on top of bitcoin (though Tether also recently introduced an ERC-20 version as well).They are not very user-friendly for laymen to utilize in everyday situations either, prohibiting the onset and velocity of payment mechanisms.While we cannot predict which blockchain technology will emerge strongest, we are encouraged that there is real competition to garner the highest network effect through a combination of speed, security and decentralization – and there will be at least a few competing public blockchains up to the task.Sidechains may very well be the solution to scaling payments and could be very useful for stablecoins. That being said, the centralization inherent in incumbent payment systems does provide advantages that cannot be replicated in true decentralized systems.There is currently no guaranteed endpoint or victor, but the key to cracking the code lies within the optimal point where sufficient levels of decentralization and security meet maximum transaction throughput to support demand.We believe that significant technology breakthroughs, necessitated by the expanding ecosystem around stablecoins, put us a lot closer to that realization next year.The key takeaway for current and future issuers is to differentiate themselves and find a way to attain the aforementioned network effect.To accomplish this, such issuers will need to rely on optimized technology, service providers, algorithms and network endpoints to make transactions cheaper and faster, with less friction. At the end of the day, the utility of a stablecoin is its ease of use – either through payment, speculative purposes or remittances.Whereas Visa, Mastercard and American Express have huge networks to offer their customers, stablecoins will find a uniform way to transact across borders and technologies, all the while maintaining a fast and secure architecture, the impact of which will produce greatly amplified ramifications for digital assets globally.In the not-too-distant future, there will also be ways to remit stablecoins nearly instantaneously with low settlement risk and on a real-time gross settlement basis. In order to get there, and since most centralized fiat-backed stablecoins typically rely on one issuer, one bank account, one auditor, and are tied to one jurisdiction’s laws, we need a better defined global legal and tax framework to govern such borderless assets.While these are typically handled between G20 member organizations and at the OECD level, blockchain technology itself may become a solution. This is also a ripe issue for one of the emerging digital asset trade groups or Self-Regulatory Organizations (SROs) to tackle head-on, given its importance to the underlying health and growth of our industry.Furthermore, a clearinghouse of stablecoins that allows for the immediate quasi-fungibility between stablecoins will also become a necessity to maintain a frictionless mode of interchange among these coins (which are effectively mostly IOUs). This clearinghouse could be similar to a check-clearing process between banks but at a far more efficient pace.Longer-term, the Holy Grail is for know-your-client (KYC) and anti-money-laundering (AML) checks and balances (or revised and potentially more adapted versions) to become enmeshed and intertwined within the blockchain so stablecoins can efficiently be used for all kinds of applications – from paying for a cup coffee to remitting money across borders.While not all of these things will come to pass in 2019, it is shaping up to be a pivotal year for further innovations across many applications in the stablecoin sphere – which in turn will have a multiplier effect across the digital asset community and further disrupt traditional banking and money transfer intermediaries.Currencies on scales image via Shutterstock"

Research. News; Learn; Research. Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Dec 3, 2018 at 05:00 UTC","Ping An, the Chinese insurance giant that built the eTradeConnect blockchain, is modifying the platform to give its 12 participating banks more control over customer relationships.","Frank Lu, head of the blockchain division of OneConnect, PingAn’s fintech arm, and the architect of eTradeConnect, told CoinDesk his team is revising the way businesses submit their data for trade financing from the network. Instead of going to a central portal, they will have to sign up through individual banks.First revealed in 2017 as a proof-of-concept by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), and formally launched in October 2018, eTradeConnect aims to bring efficiency to the trade finance market in Hong Kong for small and mid-size enterprises (SMEs) while preventing fraud.Major banks that participate in the blockchain network include HSBC, Standard Chartered, BNP Paribas in Hong Kong, Bank of East Asia, and the Hong Kong branches of all four state-owned commercial banks in China.The idea is to let one participating bank verify a customer’s credentials based on transaction history and status of purchase orders so that the SME can borrow money, pledging future payments as collateral. By putting this data on a distributed network, the project is expected to make it easier for a customer to obtain further financing, but at the same time prevent them from borrowing a total amount from multiple banks that exceeds their credit lines. Currently, SMEs register for the service through a portal run by Hong Kong Interbank Clearing Limited (HKICL), a subsidiary of the HKMA incorporated specifically for the initiative. Then they choose the bank they want to work with. But this approach will soon be revised, Lu said, in a bid to give banks more control of where corporates could choose to go. “Customers have a different goal. They would want more options for financing,” he said, adding: “But at the same time, big banks don’t want to become a selection button in a drop-down menu.”Lu admitted that this may not be in the best interest of SMEs, but said that at the end of the day, “this is a game.”“In my view, customers need money, and banks are the ones that hold this money. So eventually it’s a seller’s market. But the existing model has made it easier to launch the platform and to make it running steadily,” he said. “The next step is migration to get rid of the HKMA’s portal so that banks will feel more comfortable introducing their customers into the network [via their own platforms].”Josh Kroeker, HSBC‘s blockchain lead for global commercial banking, told CoinDesk that it will be convenient in the future if customers can access eTradeConnect via banks’ own platforms rather than “a standalone portal.”A spokesperson from the HKMA said in an email response that while the modification is still in the planning phase, the agency envisions bank customers eventually connecting to eTradeConnect through banks’ e-banking systems, open APIs or web user interfaces.Similar competitive concerns among banks are why Ping An built eTradeConnect using zero-knowledge proofs, a technology that allows someone to prove that they have knowledge of a secret without revealing the secret itself.After all, just as banks are naturally unwilling to let their customers go to the other side of the street, they are equally wary of disclosing their customers’ information to their competitors on a shared ledger.“No banks would want to entirely share the information. That’s also why there is always a lot of talks about blockchain, but very few in actual practice,” said Lu, who joined Ping An in July 2016 from IBM, where he was one of the creators of the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain. Echoing that point, HSBC’s Kroeker said that “data privacy/encryption is a key consideration during any trade finance platform design, as banks and corporates do not want their competitive trade data shared unnecessarily.” He added: “Technologies like zero-knowledge proof are very appealing as it allows these validations to occur without sharing commercially sensitive data.”In fact, Lu claims that zero-knowledge proofs are the only way to make any blockchain trade platform to come to fruition.“My thinking and vision for enterprise blockchain wasn’t entirely clear when I was at IBM, but now I believe full encryption is the only way out for consortium blockchains,” he said. That’s because in Lu’s view the model balances the goals of using a distributed ledger to boost efficiency with letting banks maintain their business secrets. When a customer submits information to a bank, the bank has absolute control, Lu said, yet when that information is sent out for cross-checking, it’s all encrypted, and no other parties will be able to see the information inside. For instance, he explained, if a customer has a $10 million purchase order and goes to, say, Standard Chartered to borrow $5 million, the bank will verify the information and then grant the request. Now, if this hypothetical customer goes to HSBC to borrow another $7 million, Standard Chartered won’t share the customer’s exact information with HSBC. Instead, HSBC will run the customized zero-knowledge proof algorithm to get a simple result of “true” or “false.”“In this case, the result will be ‘false’ because the total amount goes above the total collateral already,” Lu said, adding that’s all that HSBC needs to know.Yet because of the zero-proof knowledge algorithm, neither Ping An nor the banks will have a clear idea of the size or volume of transactions handled by others on the network. “If you ask me about transaction volume, I honestly don’t know. Ping An is not able to and [would] not dare to get access to this information,” Lu said. “That’s because each node encrypts information with their own private keys.”With eTradeConnect now launched and handling live transactions, another key question for the network is how many customers will opt in and how big these clients will be. To help create a network effect, earlier this month the HKMA announced a plan to link eTradeConnect with We.trade, the European trade finance blockchain built by IBM on Hyperledger Fabric that went live in July. Both Kroeker and Lu said the technical integration work is progressing steadily but declined to share more details on the timeline.However, technology may be the last thing Lu feels concerned about. Rather, to make full use of cross-border blockchain trade platforms, Lu said the key is to onboard clients with scale.“First of all, one single financial product must exist in both networks. And clients on the two platforms need to be sufficiently large,” he said, adding: “Technology now is not really a challenge. But for a buyer in Europe, it better have a large partner based in Asia. Otherwise, it’s just better off finding a seller within the same region.”However, Kroeker said HSBC is taking its time to make sure the technology and product can work smoothly before widely marketing the solution. He added that in the past several weeks, HSBC concluded two live transactions for Hong Kong clients – one for house-ware retailer Pricerite, the other with global manufacturer Mainetti.“The platform is definitely being used. But in terms of wide commercialization, are we rolling this out to 100,000 clients right now? Not yet.” Kroeker said. “That’s something we want to make sure we are taking feedback on board from these corporate clients and use that to prove this solution.”Ping An’s move into blockchain is also one example of how China’s largest insurer is making efforts to sell fintech services to overseas institutions.Established in the 1980s as one of the first institutions in China owned by both the private and public sectors, Ping An has grown into the world’s largest insurance company, according to Forbes’ 2018 Global 2000 list, followed by AXA and Allianz. As internet companies in China such as Alibaba and JD.com have moved into financial services with insurance and financing offerings, Ping An launched OneConnect, aiming to sell technology services, including blockchain infrastructure. A report from the Financial Times this year said the fintech subsidiary was even eyeing an initial public offering in Hong Kong to raise $2 billion. Lu said OneConnect is now planning to launch a similar blockchain trade finance platform in mainland China for a consortium of small and medium-size banks early next year. He concluded:“By using OneConnect’s technology, we want to create our own ecosystem.”eTradeConnect launch image courtesy to HKFintech Week"

It currently offers U.S. dollar onboarding and a number of trading pairs against USD. More fiat options and trading pairs are planned in the future.CEO Nick Cowan commented:“Gibraltar has found the right blend of sensible and supportive regulation, which has helped position the jurisdiction as a lodestar for the global cryptocurrency space, while allowing blockchain companies to flourish.”The GFSC announced the DLT regulatory framework in January of this year, making it mandatory for firms using blockchain to “store or transmit value belonging to others” to apply for a license. The plan to create the new licensing scheme was first revealed in December 2017.In March, the Gibraltar government indicated it was also planning to regulate initial coin offerings (ICOs), stating that most tokens are not considered securities under either Gibraltar or EU law.Gibraltar image via Shutterstock"

Earnings will be paid out via PayPal or WeChat.The app uses gamers’ GPUs to collectively power cloud-based miners to – in theory, at least – generate profit, giving card owners a percentage based on the amount of power provided, Quantumcloud’s website says.The privacy of customers’ financial data on the app is protected under General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Asus stressed.“As part of its pledge to protect user data, Quantumcloud launched with GDPR compliance in place and does not require customers to create a unique login. Instead, customers use their existing PayPal or WeChat account to log in and collect their earnings,” the firm said.Quantumcloud, however, does not guarantee that users of its software will make a profit. “Earning rates may change based on the performance of the cryptocurrency market and cannot be guaranteed or influenced in any way by Quantumcloud,” according to the announcement.More commonly, crypto miners use their GPUs to mine cryptos individually or collectively in pools, using dedicated software downloaded onto their PCs. Some cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, however, can’t effectively be mined with GPUs, requiring dedicated processors called ASICs to mine due to the high levels of difficulty.Crypto miners are going through tough times currently, though, with prices low and mining difficulty high. Hundreds of thousands are estimated to have left the industry in recent weeks. And just yesterday, China-based mining giant Canaan Creative temporarily slashed prices of its all crypto mining devices to $200 each.Demand for GPUs from crypto miners has also dropped in recent months. In August, U.S.-based chip maker Nvidia issued a financial report indicating a “substantial decline” in sales, largely due to a drop-off in miner demand.Asus store image via Shutterstock"

But that’s not how blockchain pioneer David Johnston sees it – quite the opposite.,"Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, Johnston has launched the Yeoman’s Growth Capital (YGC) fund, seeking to raise up to $200 million to invest in projects that have built functioning software but need help getting it into users’ hands.“We honestly think this is the perfect time to launch a growth capital firm that can take all of these great technologies built in the past few years and help bring them into enterprise and to mass adoption by consumers,” Johnston told CoinDesk.Johnston’s personal family office (FO), Yeoman’s Capital, has committed an undisclosed amount of capital to the YGC fund, which is now bringing in co-investors, with announcements about limited partners and general partners expected next month. One of the fund’s managing partners is Henry Liu,  former growth strategy at Facebook, who joined Yeoman’s Capital in January of this year as chief investment officer. “It’s a good time to launch this because we are focused on growth and adoption and in these bear market conditions people see the very pressing need for traction – something we have been preaching for the past couple of years,” Liu told CoinDesk.The crypto winter is looking bleak for sure. Managers who built investment funds that focused on picking tokens or making indexes have seen net asset values plummet as much as 70 to 80 percent. Many of these funds are expected to close. Also underscoring the state of affairs, blockchain incubation studio Consensys has had to scale back its operations and refocus on projects with a more immediate shot at revenues.  Indeed, the original fundraising target for the YGC fund was more ambitious, but Yeoman’s set the $200 million cap in accordance with the contraction in the crypto markets. “The cap will be re-evaluated next year once institutional players like endowment funds enter the market, with an average check size of $25 million to $40 million,” Liu told CoinDesk.YGC’s focus will be rolling the sleeves up and providing projects with long-term help at getting into enterprises, as well as driving sales and marketing, Johnston said.“I think about what we are doing at YGC as very similar to private equity or traditional growth capital,” said Johnston. “Our focus is on projects that are already live, that already have a mainnet, they have got software, they have got products. What they need help with growth and adoption.”Stepping back, Johnston, chairman of blockchain data verification startup Factom, is no stranger to the ups and downs of this industry. He co-founded BitAngels, one of the first crypto investment vehicles back in 2013. Johnston was also a founding board member of the Omni Protocol Foundation, which allowed the creation of tokens on top of the bitcoin blockchain before ethereum became the go-to network for such endeavours. He began investing his own capital in crypto projects in 2012 and started the family office in 2016, focused on big-picture decentralization and paying all his staff in crypto. Now the FO has some 40 projects in its portfolio including well-known players like tZERO, Polymath and, of course, Factom. Johnston’s goal is filling the gap in the markets between venture capital and private equity, while working directly with protocol founders and the more mature for-profits being built on top of them. Referring to big names from the private equity world that typically go bargain-hunting in times of distress, he said:“We haven’t seen the TPGs or KKRs of the world move into this space yet. But there is a huge need for this real-world adoption and growth work – and so we are ready to jump into that gap and help grow these companies and protocols for the next few years.”

YGC will employ some novel creative techniques to get projects over the line into revenue-generating territory by leveraging the FO’s portfolio companies and in some cases assembling these with other blockchain and non-blockchain partners to custom-build new avenues for growth.“You can sort of think about this as almost a technology stack where we are going to run these growth plays and it won’t just involve one project – it might involve three or four,” said Johnston. “So you can imagine us working with a telco, an exchange, a wallet, and a protocol to provide some new service.”The newly configured adoption curve might be around bringing remittances into the developing world, he said, or expanding blockchain documents and record-keeping to traditionally expensive areas like mortgages.Johnston also wants to extrapolate his YGC thesis; he plans to publish a paper soon on decentralizing growth capital which will ask what this type of funding looks like in a blockchain world.“In a blockchain world you are working with open source communities and a lot of these communities have milestones and bounties to incentivize people around the world to add value to them. We are going to be connecting into that as part of our model,” he said. Asked if he expects to see a bounce next year when institutional money begins to flow into the digital asset universe, Johnson concluded,  “I couldn’t tell what the price is going to be a month from now or a year from now. We really don’t do any short-term speculation.”Left to right: Henry Liu, David Johnston, Gavin Gillas and Mark Thorsen of Yeoman’s Growth Capital, image via YGC.Correction: This article has been amended to reflect that David Johnston began investing in crypto projects in 2012, and founded a family office in 2016.

replicated in the bitcoin world,” Allen said. “I would like it for 
customers to say ...","Dec 5, 2018 at 21:20 UTC",One of the crypto industry’s biggest players is experimenting with ways to give its users more control of their personal information.,"Crypto exchange turned corporate unicorn Coinbase has a 17-person team currently exploring decentralized identity solutions. B Byrne, the product manager of Coinbase’s identity team, told CoinDesk he wants to “help people own more of who they are online.”Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, Byrne’s approach relies on creating bridges between Coinbase products, such as its mobile wallet, with a built-in decentralized application (dapp) explorer. He explained:“I’m looking at dapps, and which of our customers are using which dapps. That’s probably a good indicator of what types of activities [our customers] want to be doing in an on-chain way.”In Byrne’s mind, the best way to start lies in identifying a small segment of Coinbase users who would gain real value from controlling more of their personal data, rather than Coinbase repeatedly collecting and storing their know-your-customer (KYC) information across the platform’s products.Over the next 12 months, Byrne said his team aims to scale these experiments from just a few users to a “meaningful group” of dapp users. In addition to tech-savvy power users, Byrne said identity solutions could have the most immediate impact for customers that “aren’t getting access to things because it’s too hard as is.”Byrne added:“We think it’s an important part of our future and we’re thinking about the tools we need to ship for that.”As such, Byrne said his team is talking with projects like the W3C Credentials Community Group. W3C member and crypto veteran Christopher Allen told CoinDesk the group aims to launch a Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) Working Group in January that can recommend standards through the Massachusetts-based World Wide Web Consortium.Although Allen is urging companies like Coinbase to take a more active role in these standards-building efforts – arguing that at least 5 percent of a tech corporation’s budget should be devoted to community contributions – Byrne said Coinbase is hesitant because such efforts are still too academic and might distract from the daily priorities of serving customers.Indeed, Coinbase’s VP of corporate and business development, Emilie Choi, told CoinDesk there aren’t plans so far to delegate a portion of the $300 million Series E that Coinbase raised in October to the identities team or related community projects – aside from perhaps hiring at least three more digital identity experts.Joseph Weinberg, chairman of the data network Shyft, told CoinDesk that the whole industry needs to “figure out and formalize better ways” to standardize development models related to digital identities. Shyft is already working with government entities in Bermuda and Mauritius to test data-sharing and privacy technologies.“You need to also focus on the governance part [of development] because these are systems that people work with,” Weinberg said. “That’s the problem that we’re not so good at in our space.”By starting with a few Coinbase Wallet users, Byrne’s team hopes to find niche groups that could benefit from partially decentralized identity solutions in specific, regulator-friendly contexts. The operative word here is “partially.”“We want to protect [Coinbase] users and make sure it’s really safe,” Byrne said. “I spend time thinking about the Social Security Administration or the DMV [Department of Motor Vehicles], because they are the purveyors of so much identity today.”Based on his own experiences building international and compliant privacy solutions, Shyft’s Weinberg told CoinDesk he doesn’t think decentralized identity solutions will ever allow crypto exchange users to control all their own data.Regardless, Weinberg said companies can cooperate to give users the right to choose how data sharing happens. He added:“I have no problem paying for a service where I know how [identity data] is being used.”When it comes to building such systems, Allen, the W3C co-founder, emphasized the importance of distinguishing authentication – “the relationship between the digital data and a real person” – from authorization – “the ability to do different types of things,” such as buying securities.Coinbase’s Byrne generally agreed with this distinction, adding “at this point, it doesn’t feel like there’s a clear standard that we’ve agreed on that solves a problem.” He said it would be a steep commitment for Coinbase to be involved with each group that is currently working on its own identity standards.However, in Weinberg’s mind, collaboration could actually make it easier for companies to expand services across jurisdictions, which is a priority for Coinbase.For example, if the crypto exchange Kraken was already operating in one Caribbean country, then if companies like Coinbase entered the region they could simply query the international ID network for overlapping data instead of on-boarding users all over again.Even if Byrne’s team develops identity solutions that reduce cross-platform friction or increase customers’ privacy, these solutions will probably rely on public tools and protocols that exist beyond Coinbase.“It’s not a zero sum game at this point,” Byrne said. “Whatever standards we agree on, upkeep will be critical.”To underscore this same point, Allen mentioned the infamous Heartbleed vulnerability that impacted several types of open-source software in 2014. That ripple effect across the tech industry started because just one person was updating the OpenSSL code years after its initial creation. A critical bug eventually crept in.“I don’t want to see that problem replicated in the bitcoin world,” Allen said. “I would like it for customers to say: I don’t want to hire a qualified custodian unless you’re contributing to the commons.”Plus, Allen said, official working groups like the one that his W3C community project aims to become, can create international standards that are referenced as an authority by regulators and technologists alike.Without commenting on any specific resources or priorities, Byrne agreed Coinbase would need to commit to keeping the infrastructure for future solutions “healthy.” Byrne also expressed curiosity about how Coinbase could someday take a more active role in community efforts.“A failure mode of past identity thinking has been trying to win it and own everybody’s identity completely as opposed to working in standardized ways that decentralize and distribute out that power,” Byrne said, adding:“Everybody is still just getting started.”Colored pencils image via Shutterstock"

It’s now eyeing blockchain as a way to automate these processes in order to make them cheaper and more efficient since the parties involved will no longer need to submit the same information multiple times.In June 2017, Calastone claimed it successfully completed the first phase of a blockchain proof-of-concept for “distributed market infrastructure,” and said at the time it would move its system to a private, permissioned blockchain network in 2019.“A blockchain-enabled marketplace means alleviating operational inefficiencies, increasing performance and generating greater savings – a win-win for everybody,” Calastone’s deputy CEO Ken Tregidgo said at the time.Back in February, Calastone predicted that moving to blockchain could help the global mutual funds market save over $2.5 billion a year, using data from a 2016 Deloitte study.Other players in the asset management industry are also looking to bring mutual fund transactions onto blockchain platforms. As early as 2016, five major British mutual fund operators, including Aberdeen Asset Management and Aviva Investors, collaborated on exploring blockchain in trading systems to reduce costs.Last year in December, U.S. mutual funds manager Vanguard said it will begin using smart contracts in some of its business operations soon.

In the next phase of development, the Settler will support domestic deferred net settlement and real-time gross settlement payments.When a payment obligation arises on Corda during the course of business, one party now has the option to request settlement using XRP, said R3. The other party can be notified that settlement in XRP has been requested and that they must instruct a payment to the required address before the specified deadline. Once an oracle service validates the payment has been made then both parties can treat the obligation as settled.R3’s Corda platform has taken some bold steps to build its ecosystem while also building bridges between the private enterprise blockchain world and the public domain, with tokenisation of assets being added earlier this year with Cordite.R3 image via CoinDesk archive"

Research. News; Learn; Research. Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Nov 30, 2018 at 05:00 UTC","An influx of research and development is beginning to form around ethereum 1x, a proposed upgrade that aims to more quickly improve the usability of the world’s third-largest blockchain.","While the exact code changes that will comprise the upgrade have yet to be settled, active discussions suggest a myriad of different proposals could be activated by June 2019, should a final proposal ultimately be formulated, proposed and approved by users of the ethereum network.Still the plan, first reported by CoinDesk last week, is in its early stages of development.Indeed, there’s even been a suggestion by Afri Schoedon, release manager for the Parity ethereum client, to release the upgrade on its own, separate blockchain network. Nevertheless, there are many voices contending ethereum 1x ought to be activated on the existing blockchain – and soon.Originally thought to be an addition to an upgrade called ethereum 2.0 – ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin has referred to it recently by an older name “Serenity” – the roadmap for this upgrade changed in June to include new design specifications that are projected to delay activation.As explained to CoinDesk by Schoedon, developers are now more certain ethereum 2.0 will not go into production before the year 2020. According to Schoedon, developers “started panicking and saying, ‘Hey we really need to find intermediate solutions’” – creating the impetus for new ideas able to be implemented in the near-term.And though ideas for ethereum 1x may “sound too radical or controversial” for now, Schoedon said that the goal is to discuss any and all ideas inclusively with community stakeholders such that “none of the upgrades will be controversial in the end.”With plans for ethereum 1x originally discussed during in-person meetings at an ethereum developer conference, Devcon4, earlier this month, certain members of the community were disgruntled at the lack of public involvement. Still, the controversy has been set aside for now with the creation of public forums to openly discuss ethereum 1x.In addition, meetings to coordinate efforts on this proposed upgrade are expected to proceed under Chatham House Rules, meaning public disclosure of the content of discussions must exclude speaker attribution.With the intent of encouraging open discussion among developers, the first of these meetings will occur tomorrow at 14:00 UTC.“We need to to be very sensible about how we do this,” Schoedon told CoinDesk, adding:“We need to be very inclusive with everyone in the community and be very open and transparent about talking about all the ideas and discussing what might be the best approach.”According to meeting minutes from earlier discussions at DevCon4 published by Dan Heyman, the program director of ethereum blockchain development group PegaSys, there are currently four different working groups tasked with advancing ethereum 1x.One of these groups, led by ethereum core developer Alexey Akhunov, is leading the effort to introduce storage rent to the ethereum platform. Storage rent is a mechanism discussed by developers in detail back in March. Its purpose is to curb the growth of the ethereum “state” – otherwise understood to be all of the active applications and accounts operating on the blockchain network.Given the fast acceleration of decentralized applications (dapps) built on ethereum through smart contracts – self-deploying lines of code – the amount of data being stored on the blockchain to support these contracts is also increasing.This presents an issue for new users wanting to participate in the network by deploying software called nodes that download and maintain a full copy of the active blockchain state.The larger the state, as Akhunov told CoinDesk, the longer it takes for new computers joining the ethereum network to download such copies and maintain them.Adding to this, Schoedon estimated the size of ethereum blockchain data to be currently sitting at around 125 gigabytes, with the active running state of the network being roughly 10 gigabytes.“It’s growing at a pace that we’re probably looking at 200 or 300 gigabytes of chain data by end of next year and a massive state,” said Schoedon.As such, the proposal to charge a fee to users who are storing smart contract data on the blockchain is aimed at mitigating the speed at which the ethereum blockchain is currently growing and thereby ensure accessibility of the network for all users at least in the short-term.However, this is not the only proposal currently being discussed among developers. An alternative proposal suggests moving certain portions of smart contract data off-chain. This would effectively push the responsibility of data storage to dapp developers.The mechanism – called “stateless contracts” – to facilitate off-chain smart contract data would be simpler to implement than storage rents, Akhunov concedes.Still, there are concerns with this proposal as it relates to how dapp developers share and update off-chain data.“I have a problem with stateless contracts at the moment. People think they are actually easier to implement and they are easier to implement in terms of protocol upgrade,” said Akhunov. “But they will be much harder for the dapp developers to support.”In addition to storage rent, another 1x-focused group is exploring proposals to archive old information stored on the blockchain in a bid to relieve the pressures of a growing state.But outside of ethereum’s data storage mechanisms, a third team of developers – called “the simulation group” – aims to “analyze the issues that happen through the blockchain when block size grows or when the latency increases,” Akhunov said.This is particularly relevant due to code optimizations that have increased the speed of block propagation on ethereum presently. As a result of new blocks being relayed throughout the network more quickly, ethereum miners are also expected to be able to add in a greater number of transactions per block and collect a larger amount of transaction fees.Akhunov said that studies suggesting exactly how much more the maximum amount of transaction fees collected by miners – called the “gas limit” – are few and far between.“There are only a few studies that have been done to analyze how blocks propagate through the network and what would happen if you raise the gas limit,” said Akhunov.Some of the development efforts going into ethereum 1x are focussed on running simulations to test higher gas limits, given that it’s a key area of research around the wider progress toward relieving scaling pressures faced by the network today.As such, ethereum 1x – outside of addressing issues to do with blockchain state size – is also expected to feature improvements to transaction throughput on ethereum. Indeed, the two issues go hand-in-hand in the context of supporting more network activity.According to Akhunov, ethereum 1x is an “ensemble” of different proposals that are only effective when deployed together.He told CoinDesk:“We want to solve these problems together and not just one thing. It has to be solved as an ensemble rather than one thing at a time.”The dovetailing nature of the groups also covers the fourth working team, which is looking into decreasing the cost of smart contract deployment. The idea is that such efforts could lead to ways to balance out a potential increase to smart contract storage costs with proposals like the rent one.By putting forward an early implementation of eWASM – a new virtual machine that processes smart contract code – ethereum developers aim to leverage the new technology and create so-called “precompiles” more easily.Precompiles are commonly deployed smart contract operations that are optimized to run natively on ethereum for a fixed fee, or gas cost. And as Akhunov explains, there are currently only a handful created on the ethereum network.But the demand is high for more to be added to streamline smart contract development.With a “limited number of people in the core development team,” Akhunov admits that “if we try to start implementing all the precompiles people are asking for, we’re never going to be able to do anything else.”One of the biggest hurdles when it comes to developing precompiles is deciding what a fair gas cost for a particular smart operation should be.Normally, developers create formulas to gauge the energy and time precompiles take to execute. But through leveraging the eWASM engine, this process of pricing is done automatically.As Akhunov highlighted:“The eWASM engine will do something called metering. It will meter the operation and it will charge exactly as much gas as being consumed by the operation.”Predicting the construction process of precompiles to get much “easier” for ethereum core developers through the technology, Akhunov also added that once fully-tested, “the plan is to open eWASM for all smart contract developers.”Indeed, the longer-term goal is to do away with the need to create precompiles all together. Among other benefits to smart contract developers, the eWASM engine as previously reported is expected to run all smart contract operations at native network speeds and efficiency.Still, until that future is realized, etheruem 1x is envisioned to sustain the ethereum network with what Parity developer Afri Schoedon calls “out of the box” solutions.And while all these solutions are projected to be activated on “a very accelerated timeline,” Schoedon highlights that, on his part, no concrete action will be taken until a “broad consensus in the community” is reached.Correction:  A previous version of this article referred to stateless contracts as stateless clients.  Image via CoinDesk archives "

However, restrictions on deposits and withdrawals had been in place since April 2017, when Wells Fargo stopped providing correspondent banking services to Tether’s Taiwanese banking partners.While transactions from the Tether website were halted following the November 2017 breach, the company encouraged buyers “to use the services of any one of a dozen global exchanges to acquire or dispose of Tethers for either USD or other cryptocurrencies.”Since that time, customers have been able to deposit USDT to the Bitfinex exchange – which has overlapping shareholders and management with Tether Ltd. – and withdraw fiat, although many customers have complained that they waited weeks for their money to arrive.Some gave up and cancelled the withdrawals, transferring their USDT to another exchange, such as Kraken, which offers a USDT-USD trading pair. Following persistent complaints from customers regarding delayed withdrawals, Bitfinex announced new fees for large or frequent fiat withdrawals.In Tuesday’s announcement, Tether said that withdrawals and deposits would be subject to minimums of $100,000 and 100,000 USDT, respectively.It also detailed fees for depositing or withdrawing fiat from the platform. Depending on the size of the withdrawal, fees range from 0.4 percent (or $1,000, if greater) to 3 percent. Customers can only withdraw fiat once per week, and higher fees will be charged for those withdrawing more than once per month.For deposits of any size, fees are a flat 0.1 percent.Bitfinex also made an announcement related to tether on Tuesday, saying that customers would be able to trade USDT directly for dollars through a trading pair. It also announced a trading pair for euros and the euro-linked EURT.Bitfinex called this policy “Tether neutrality.” The policy appears to amount to allowing the rate at which USDT can be redeemed through Bitfinex to float according to market conditions.Whereas previously the rate of exchange was locked in at $1 to 1 USDT – because the exchange only allowed deposits and withdrawals – Bitfinex will now offer direct trading pairs.Across all major exchanges, tether’s market value hit its lowest level on Kraken in mid-October, briefly trading for just $0.85.Tether image via Shutterstock"

Back in October, Gemini Trust Company, an exchange co-founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, announced it would offer protection for digital assets through a consortium of insurers arranged by global professional services firm Aon.Centuries-old insurance marketplace Lloyd’s of London is also underwriting cover against the theft of cryptocurrencies as announced in August by Kingdom Trust, a qualified custodian of around 30 cryptocurrencies and tokens at the time.The crypto insurance market is estimated to be worth around $6 billion, but, as reported, that level of coverage is thought to be insufficient considering the top three exchanges each handle more than $1 billion of trades a day.

While the remaining banks were not named in official announcements, some sources say Santander is also one of the group.The initiative was announced at a recent EU blockchain roundtable event called “Bringing industries together for Europe to lead in blockchain technologies,” held on Nov. 20 in Brussels, Belgium.The new association will have representatives from both public and private sectors with an aim to “garner support from private blockchain and [distributed ledger technology] experts to contribute to outline the EU’s strategy regarding these technologies,” the BBVA said.The association is aimed to develop guidelines and protocols for the blockchain industry, and promote the EU’s blockchain standards internationally. It will further provide information for the implementation of Europe’s blockchain strategy.Carlos Kuchkovsky, BBVA’s head of research & development for new digital business, said that the association could have an important role to play in terms of “establishing blockchain best practice and standards and at avoiding fragmentation on a European level.”Kuchkovsky also believes that the EC initiative will help provide more clarity to the “regulatory uncertainty” that currently surrounds the use of blockchain tech.He added:“Blockchain is not only a technology, but it engenders new business models creating a tokenized economy and paving the way to a decentralized economy in the future.”As part of its moves to adopt and develop blockchain across the economic bloc, the EC in April formed the European Blockchain Partnership (EBP) along with 27 member countries to support the delivery of cross-border digital public services.European Commission image via Shutterstock "

The guidance will set out how nations should govern crypto exchanges, companies offering initial coin offerings (ICOs) and digital wallet providers.That initiative comes in response to leaders from the G20 nations who had called for international coordination on the issue and last week reiterated their pledge to regulate crypto-assets.“We will regulate crypto-assets for anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism in line with FATF standards and we will consider other responses as needed,” they stated.The U.S. Treasury’s Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence also called on the international community earlier this year for stronger cryptocurrency regulations.London image via Shutterstock "

Moreover, he spent investors’ money for his own personal use on hotels, food and clothing and more.After the firm’s formation, he began promoting AriseBank and AriseCoin around June 2017 through press releases, public video interviews, social media outlets and his own websites, according to a court document unsealed Wednesday.If convicted, Rice faces up to 120 years in federal prison, the Attorney’s Office said.Erin Nealy Cox, the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Texas, said:“My office is committed to enforcing the rule of law in the cryptocurrency space. The Northern District of Texas will not tolerate this sort of flagrant deception – online or off.”In January, Rice was also sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), together with his co-founder Stanley Ford, for alleged fraud and issuing unregistered securities during an ICO. The Texas Department of Banking issued AriseBank a cease-and-desist order in the same month.An SEC complaint from February further states that Rice is on probation as a part of a plea deal stemming from a Collin County, Texas, indictment in 2015 for theft and tampering with government records. He is also under felony indictment in Dallas County, Texas, for assault, after which he allegedly destroyed evidence by stealing the victim’s phone and deleting an audio recording of the incident.FBI agent image via Shutterstock"

Research. News; Learn; Research. Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Nov 23, 2018 at 13:00 UTC",Ethereum developers are quietly discussing a previously undisclosed upgrade that could boost the capabilities of the technology more aggressively in the short-term.,"Specifically, the minutes from four private meetings that took place at the Devcon4 conference at the end of October, refer to an upgrade named “ethereum 1x,” possibly to be activated in June 2019.An internal document containing the minutes was published to Github by an engineer of the ethereum virtual machine, Greg Colvin, on Friday.While previously undisclosed, the minutes have been verified by one attendee who wished to remain anonymous. They told CoinDesk that developers believe the proposals are too early-stage to be discussed publicly. Other developers did not respond to requests for comment.Still, the meeting notes give a window into one potential reason for the lack of response – ethereum’s more veteran developers appear to be of differing opinions of how best to solicit community feedback on technical proposals in sensitive ideation stages.Writing on GitHub, release manager for the Parity ethereum client Afri Schoedon expressed that he had been unaware of the document or that plans were in motion for an impending upgrade.As with all public blockchain networks, ethereum requires a distributed consensus among software users for any changes to its rules, though code changes are typically proposed by developers.At one of the meetings, attendees included ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin; Joseph Lubin, the founder of the largest ethereum startup Brooklyn-based Consensys Systems; and notable community organizers and developers including Lane Rettig, Peter Szilagyi and Hudson Jameson. The notes suggest that ethereum developers may be under pressure to augment their public roadmap in ways that seek to add improvements at an accelerated timeline. Several changes were discussed for inclusion in a system-wide upgrade, or hard fork, currently targeted for June, that have not previously been associated with a 2019 release.The series of upgrades potentially includes replacing ethereum’s underlying virtual machine (EVM), the component that processes smart contract code. It would also introduce “rent,” or storage fees for smart contracts, that would seek to stem the growth of the ethereum blockchain (currently around 1 terabyte on a full archive node), which must be downloaded by all participating nodes.A defining principle of the project, as outlined in the document, is a “sense of urgency.” Other project values included “small, sequential updates,” “as much public feedback as possible” and “data driven analysis to inform motivations for changes.”While the upgrade is still in early stages, developers have previously discussed the implementation eWASM as an alternative to the EVM, which would allow a faster and more dexterous approach to ethereum computation.Rent and similar mechanisms to curtail the growth rate of the blockchain have also been publicly considered, but may require a “large overhaul,” Vitalik Buterin suggested in the meeting. Other ideas to make the state size more manageable are also being discussed.Developers at the meeting also stressed the importance of working privately in order to coordinate more rapidly around changes. Pushing for as much transparency as possible, Buterin is said to have stated he is “uncomfortable with institutional private calls and absolutely against private forum[s].”Still, reacting to the meeting minutes on an internal developer chat Friday, Schoedon expressed disapproval that the planning had occurred without public involvement, writing, “If you want to have private working groups, that’s [fine] and makes sense but you should be transparent and maybe start with a public announcement.”In response to the meeting, at least three working groups have now been said to have formed – one to focus on the EVM changes, another to discuss changes to smart contract costs and another that would seek to simulate and model the impact of such alternations.A call is now scheduled for Nov. 30 to reconvene the members of these groups.Accelerating image via Shutterstock"

Research. News; Learn; Research. Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Dec 10, 2018 at 05:00 UTC","Stasis, a Malta-based issuer of stablecoins, has hired accounting firm BDO Malta to conduct quarterly and annual audits of its financials, including the euro reserves backing the startup’s EURS token.","The engagement aims to dispel any doubts that EURS stablecoins are backed one-to-one by euros. Many cryptocurrency investors and traders will be wary of any such claim by a stablecoin issuer, due to nagging questions around the dominant issuer, Tether.Tether’s USDT tokens lost their parity with the U.S. dollar in a dramatic fashion in October, due to widespread doubts that the company held one U.S. dollar in bank deposits for every token in circulation.More than a year ago, Tether reiterated its promise of regular audits to prove it held sufficient fiat collateral, but so far it has still not delivered. Rather it severed ties with the auditing firm Friedman LLP in January and instead produced documents prepared by a law firm in June and its bank in November, which vouch for the existence of sufficient deposits.Apparently alluding to the controversy surrounding Tether, Stasis CFO Vyacheslav Kim said in a statement last week:“The recent conversation around stablecoins has hinged on two things: compliance and transparency. By providing verification by a top accounting firm, in addition to EURS’ existing regulatory compliance under Maltese law, we’ve established EURS as a standout option for European investors.”In addition to the audits, BDO Malta – a member of the BDO International network of accounting firms, which operates out of more than 160 countries according to its website – will “provide weekly cash reserve verification” of the fiat collateral behind EURS, Stasis said. The first such report was published Thursday. It makes clear that the document does not constitute an audit.Stablecoin issuance is an increasingly crowded and competitive corner of the cryptocurrency sector, and a number of providers are aiming to reassure a skeptical market by publicizing their relationships with prominent accounting firms.Within the past month Circle, which provides the dollar-linked USDC, has published an attestation of its dollar collateral prepared by Grant Thornton LLP; Gemini, which issues the USD-pegged Gemini Dollar, has done the same with an attestation from BPM; and Paxos, issuer of the dollar-linked Paxos Standard, has published an attestation from Withum.Yet Stasis stands out by promising full audits.Michael Shaub, who teaches auditing and accounting ethics at Texas A&M University, told CoinDesk that “I would take much more heart” from a full audit of a stablecoin provider’s financials, as opposed to a verification or attestation.Explaining the differences between verifications, attestations and audits, Shaub said that an audit “is applied broadly to the financial statements” – including income statements, cash flow statements and balance sheets – while an attestation (of the sort Circle, Gemini and Paxos publish) “is limited to some narrow representation,” for example, that the requisite bank deposits existed at a moment in time.“The level of assurance is very similar,” he said, but an audit provides important context that goes beyond an isolated snapshot: “You can reach more of a conclusion of, is that money likely to be in the bank tomorrow? Was it in the bank yesterday?”A verification, meanwhile, provides far less context, and does not necessarily have to be prepared by a qualified accountant. Tether, as noted above, published a verification prepared by its law firm.In a verification, the firm in question and its accountant (or lawyer) decide on a procedure, and the accountant carries it out as agreed; that contrasts with the rigorous standards an attestation or audit requires.For example, Shaub noted, a verification does not necessarily indicate that the bank deposits aren’t simply a one-time loan, or being shuffled around between accounts.Stasis’ promised audits – the first is expected in Q1 2019 – are all the more notable since some issuers, and not just Tether, have claimed that audits are currently unobtainable in the stablecoin market.Cameron Winklevoss, Gemini’s co-founder and president, said on Twitter in October that “there is no financial report framework [with respect to] to audit conformity [with] a stablecoin. So you can’t perform an ‘audit.'”Instead, he continued, issuers must “rely on a 3rd party to attest to whether an assertion (that there is a 1:1 peg) is accurate.”Even so, according to a Stasis spokesperson, “BDO Malta will perform full audits once a quarter, plus verifications every week.”When contacted by CoinDesk, Sam Spiridonov, the audit partner at BDO Malta who signed Stasis’ first weekly verification, said the “audit will cover all the financial statements of STSS (Malta) Limited, including the euro deposits.”In the meantime, Tether continues to dominate the stablecoin market, despite the controversy surrounding it.With a market capitalization of nearly $1.9 billion, USDT is the seventh-most valuable cryptocurrency overall. Stasis’ EURS, by contrast, ranks 82nd, with a market cap of just $35 million, according to CoinMarketCap.Euro image via Shutterstock"

Non-dilutive funding means an entity doesn’t need to sell equity to receive financing.The funding program is related to the DHS’s November solicitation – “Preventing Forgery and Counterfeiting of Certificates and Licenses” – through which the agency is looking to enhance its capabilities to prevent fake documentation using blockchain technology.“DHS has need of the innovations coming from this community to ensure we are at least a step ahead of national security threats,” said Melissa Oh, managing director at SVIP.To qualify for a grant, blockchain startups need to present proposed solutions covering various use cases, including the issuing of digital documents related to travel, citizenship, immigration and employment authorization, as well as cross-border oil and raw material movements.The funding is open to startups and small businesses that have not had a government contract in the last year totaling $1 million or more and that have under 200 employees at the time of application, the DHS indicates.“The broad Homeland Security mission includes the need to issue entitlements, licenses and certifications for a variety of purposes including travel, citizenship, employment eligibility, immigration status and supply chain security,” said Anil John, SVIP technical director.He added:“Understanding the feasibility and utility of using blockchain and distributive ledger technology for the digital issuance of what are currently paper-based credentials is critical to preventing their loss, destruction, forgery and counterfeiting.”The DHS has been interested in blockchain technology as early as 2015 when it started accepting research proposals from small businesses to better understand blockchain technology.

You can follow her on Twitter at @doveywan. ","The following is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk’s 2018 Year in Review. While emerging assets are always turbulent, 2018 has been an especially violent year for the crypto markets.Many investors who entered during the bull market of 2017 got badly burned during this year’s prolonged crash because they were deluded into believing that market prices accurately reflected underlying value. However, this should not be taken to mean that crypto as an industry is doing poorly.There are, in fact, two facets to the blockchain industry: the investment side and the development side.Unlike the traditional financial market where we usually tend to have a clear expectation guidance and consensus around valuation models that can align the two, in crypto we have experienced a significant disconnect between investors and developers due to the distorting effect of hype on market prices and an information asymmetry in regards to actual development.So, while the bloodshed in the markets we’ve seen in 2018 is likely to continue into 2019, cryptocurrencies are actually making significant progress on the technology development front. This next year will be painful to force us to step out of the bubble, learn the lesson and do a reality check.Still, a healthy consolidation and the development of fundamentals will lead to eventual prosperity.We didn’t see another manic gold rush on the internet after the dot.com bubble, but the internet eventually ate the worldIn the past two months, I’ve had many hours of conversation with key players in all sectors of the industry, including exchanges, traders, miners, founders, primary market investors and regulators.My conclusions follow regarding why 2019 will be the year our violent delights reach their violent ends.Far too many projects raised far too much money, often at outrageous valuations in the hundreds of millions. Even zcash, a relatively mature project that is seeing significant growth, is now trading at a ~300 million market cap (fully diluted $1.2 billion). And yet, there were projects with less than six months of development which raised at a valuation on par with zcash’s.A proper valuation model is missing, investments are largely “FOMOmental” instead of fundamental.Additionally, many of these high-profile projects are set to launch their mainnets in 2019, and most fail to meet expectations. The underwhelming adoption they face will be a further bear signal to the market that the “real adoption” investors had been waiting for won’t arrive in time to bail them out.The organic community is tiny, developers are disappointed by the infrastructure and tooling and many investors will cut their losses and sell when they no longer believe “only the sky is the limit.”Our failure in managing expectations well will set alternative cryptocurrencies up for a major correction, as the market is also highly correlated with BTC’s price. Hashrate and difficulty is a trailing indicator of price and will in return influence supply – for the first time since 2011, the bitcoin mining hashrate has significantly decreased with massive miners scaling back.Many miners disassembled their mining operations entirely, because prices have fallen so much that bitcoin isn’t even worth the marginal cost to mine it. A big part of what landed us in this situation is the
“hash rate bubble” of 2017, during which many miners overextended their mining operations under the mistaken assumption that the price of bitcoin would surely rise in the short term.Miners who used to hold their coins may be forced to sell, sending the price of the coins spiraling further downwards. A lesser-known factor that will affect prices over the next few quarters is the fact that many funds that popped up in Asia from late 2017 to early 2018 are on a one year cycle (6 + 6 month terms). This means that they’ll reach the end of their term and must liquidate.Many western funds are on monthly redemption terms, but they also face panic redemption from LPs.When I told my friends that Eric Melzter and myself were leaving our positions at large funds in order to strike out on our own with Primitive Ventures, many asked us “Why now in such a brutal market?” Our answer is that it’s in fact a fantastic time to start a fund.Although temporary market trends may be brutal, that very condition creates the opportunity for extraordinary returns for anyone who can invests in truly valuable work while it is still massively undervalued by a spooked market. It may be the worst of times for the markets, but it is the best of times for real development.During the bull run of 2017 and early 2018, there was too much noise in the crypto space. Projects raised tens of millions even before what would normally be a Series A, and became slow, distracted, and unmotivated. Further, even quality teams were forced to compete in the game of token prices and had to divert a significant amount of their time and money toward keeping token price up and investors satiated.In this current colder climate, those who remain are truly committed, and they no longer feel as much pressure to issue pointless tokens that will only cause friction. It is more possible for a blockchain product to gain organic adoption now that investors won’t be confusing popularity with real usage.We are beginning to see fairer distribution models with real tech backing, such as Grin and Raven, which have attracted a dedicated community even without offering an opportunity to invest in a pre-sale or pre-mine. We are also observing the products of academic research being implemented in real-world settings, such as the integration of bulletproofs into Monero, the Sapling upgrade for zcash, and the Bitcoin_NG implementation in Aeternity as a part of their recent Roma launch.We have seen the emphasis return to real developer usability instead of chasing vanity metrics such as transactions per second, and native use case discovery rather than endless discussions surrounding on-chain governance.The non-technical development of the crypto industry is also by no means in hibernation during this winter. We have seen much activity amongst various jurisdictions hoping to become the “crypto capital” of the world and attract the talent, capital and enterprise that will gain them a share in an industry that could soon be worth many trillions.Silicon Valley’s dominance in previous technologies won’t necessarily carry over to crypto since it’s crypto ecosystem is not complete. The miners who are a crucial component of the ecosystem are certainly not located in California, with its high electricity and operational expenses, and traders are also largely outside the U.S. due to its high taxes and strict regulations.The distributed nature of crypto has fittingly allowed for the global distribution of the opportunities it creates.What does this mean for 2019 and beyond? Crypto is set to radically upend the way we transact, privacy, ownership and many more things we can’t anticipate. In the near term, market conditions will be brutal, but that is actually helping nurture real value that is simply not reflected in the prices yet.Investors and builders alike must not be blindsided by mistaking short-term market movements with real value. Now isn’t the time to put crypto on pause, but rather to take a much closer look at the projects addressing real needs in a way uniquely enabled by cryptocurrency, distributed ledger and blockchain technology.In short, it’s the worst of times, but it’s also the best of times.Have a hot take on 2018? CoinDesk is looking for contributors for its 2018 Year in Review.

They cash, they said, was taken for uses such as “investing in a software development business for personal interest.”Karpeles is also accused of manipulating the data on Mt. Gox’s trading system to fabricate the balance and playing a great role in “totally destroying the confidence of bitcoin users.”Back in 2017, Karpeles pleaded not guilty in the court to the charges of embezzlement and data manipulation, and he also denied such allegations at the time.Later in April of this year, he apologized for the company’s bankruptcy, stating, “I never imagined things would end this way and I am forever sorry for everything that’s taken place and all the effect it had on everyone involved.”Mt. Gox officially filed for liquidation in April 2014 after claiming to have been hacked for 850,000 bitcoin, some of which was later found.The case has been ongoing since then. In July 2018, creditors had a victory when the court issued an order approving a petition to begin civil rehabilitation.Last month, the trustee of Mt.

In December 2017, bitcoin peaked at nearly $20,000, but prices have since plummeted and the global average across exchanges was $3,387 at press time. The difference marks an over 80 percent decline in value over the period. Most other cryptocurrencies, including ether and XRP, have also been hit hard by the bear mood pervading the market.The FCA formed a task force early this year to “develop thinking and policy” around cryptocurrencies and blockchain. The group is assessing the impact and the potential benefits of the technology and will determine if, and what, rules might be needed in response to its findings.The watchdog said last month, however, that it was considering a ban on some cryptocurrency-based derivatives over concerns that retail investors are being sold “complex, volatile and often leveraged derivatives products” with “underlying market integrity issues.”Allianz Global Investors image via Shutterstock "

In particular, Davidson told Inskeep, he has suggested a private funding program wherein “the American people, or whomever should choose to donate,” (including residents of Mexico) would be able to fund the wall’s construction.He went on to add:“You could do it with sort of like a crowdfunding site or you could do a blockchain and you could have WallCoins, but you could raise the money and frankly if we get it right at the Treasury you could even pay with Mexican pesos.”Davidson noted that this funding would not support a full wall across the entire border and that some parts could likely be reinforced with fences.“There are areas that you would want to secure with a wall, and if you look at the areas where you have secured them with walls, $5 billion isn’t going to build a wall like the Great Wall of China, this is going to build secure fences,” he said.Davidson is an outspoken supporter of the cryptocurrency space, having previously held a round-table event with more than 80 representatives from both the crypto and finance industries to discuss possible legislation for initial coin offerings.A spokesperson for Davidson did not respond to a request for comment by press time.Border wall image via Shutterstock"

The tokens included in the list range from ERC-20 tokens to independent projects.“Over time, we intend to offer our customers access to greater than 90 percent of all compliant digital assets by market cap,” the post said.There are some caveats however. The post explained that the process to add new tokens requires “significant exploratory work” on both technical and legal compliance aspects, and the firm cannot guarantee that all the named tokens will actually be added.The post went on to say:“Furthermore, our listing process may result in some of these assets being listed solely for customers to buy and sell, without the ability to send or receive using a local wallet. Finally, as per our listing process, we will add new assets on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis, which allows us to add assets efficiently and responsibly.”The exchange warned its customers that some may see assets appear on public-facing APIs and other services before they are officially listed, but should that happen, Coinbase “cannot commit to when or whether these assets will become available.”Coinbase customers were able to see hints of tokens being added previously as well. Bots were able to take advantage of the exchange’s API to begin trading 0x a few minutes before it was officially listed.In another example, users reported seeing zcash appear on the Coinbase Wallet app before it was officially announced.Editor’s note: This article has been updated.Brian Armstrong onstage at Techcrunch Disrupt London in 2014"

Founded in 2002, it mitigates settlement risk for participating banks with a “payment versus payment” service, in which both sides of a trade are completed at the same time.But its new platform aims to solve current issues in the forex market, such as a lack of standardization and automation.For example, a limited number of participants currently net trades with each other on a regular basis, and even when they do, often there is a need to manage the process manually, according to IBM and CLS. In addition, many participants do not net the payments for forex trades, instead settling on a gross basis, which exposes them to settlement risk and leads to higher intraday liquidity demands, the companies said.“CLSNet will deliver the standardization and automation needed for non-CLS settled transactions,” said Adam Josephart, managing director of the fixed-income division at Morgan Stanley.Barry Lo, general manager for the bank-wide operation department of Bank of China (Hong Kong), added that CLSNet in particular “will enhance operational efficiency in trade matching and payment netting for non-CLS settled currencies such as CNH [the offshore version of China’s renminbi], and strengthen our risk management.”The now-live CLSNet works for over 120 fiat currencies and is designed to standardize and increase the level of payment netting in the foreign exchange market. It was developed in collaboration with buy-side and sell-side institutions. At the same time, the platform supports compliance with a code of conduct for the foreign exchange markets that CLS helped to develop, the company stated.“A standardized and automated payment netting process will lead to improved intraday liquidity, reduced cost, improved operational efficiencies and ultimately support business growth,” said Alan Marquard, chief strategy and development officer at CLS.CLS and IBM developed CLSNet on the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain. But CLS has been experimenting with blockchain technology since early 2015, before the Hyperledger consortium started.Those attempts eventually grew into CLSNet, with Bank of America, Bank of China, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Citibank, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley on board when the project was unveiled in September 2017.From the beginning, CLS worked with IBM on blockchain solutions. However, in May of this year, the forex trading utility announced a $5 million investment in another major enterprise DLT vendor, R3.Yet R3’s platform will not be used for the current services CLS is working on, Komarraju told CoinDesk.“Our investment in R3 has no impact on the future development of our products using Hyperledger Fabric, as we do not believe that DLT should be a ‘one-network universe,'” he said, adding:“We believe that the industry will benefit from a choice in providers, which is why we have chosen to align ourselves with two key providers, R3 and IBM, in the DLT space.”Meanwhile, CLS and IBM have expanded their collaboration. This summer the two companies announced a proof of concept for a separate project named LedgerConnect, a financial blockchain “app store” offering DLT-based services for know-your-customer processes, sanctions screening, collateral management, derivatives post-trade processing and reconciliation and market data.Currency trading image via Shutterstock."

Research. News; Learn; Research. Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Nov 24, 2018 at 11:20 UTC",Noelle Acheson is a veteran of company analysis and member of CoinDesk’s product team.,"The following article originally appeared in Institutional Crypto by CoinDesk, a newsletter for the institutional market, with news and views on crypto infrastructure delivered every Tuesday. Sign up here.With the market reeling from the SEC’s settlement last week with two ICO issuers for not registering their tokens as securities, something significant has been overlooked.Before we get to that, let’s briefly review what happened.Last week the SEC reached settlements with AirFox and Paragon in its first cases brought purely for lack of registration, rather than for fraudulent activity. In characteristic overreaction, the market seemed to assume that ICOs were now “over.” This is far from true. What is “over” (finally!) is the vapid hype of token structures that don’t make sense, fund-raisings based on no business plan and ICOs that followed the “me too” model.A new phase, a more realistic and constructive one, is just beginning.Earlier this month, an SEC director revealed that the agency plans to release “plain English” guidance for when a token is and is not a security. Analysts have been poring over the subsequent official statement summarizing recent rulings for a sign of this. They haven’t found it.What seems to have been largely overlooked is that the statement also shines the spotlight on crypto exchanges. This is likely to have a much bigger impact on the sector in the short term.Last week, the SEC announced a settlement with the founder of EtherDelta, a “decentralized exchange” for ethereum-based tokens, who had been accused of knowingly breaking securities laws by neither registering the platform with the SEC nor operating under an exemption. This was the SEC’s first enforcement action against a token exchange for failing to register.In its statement, the SEC outlines what exactly is considered an “exchange,” and under what circumstances a token trading venue would be required to register – basically, in all circumstances in which tokens change hands on a platform.Remember the report by the New York State Office of the Attorney General (OAG) on crypto exchanges from a couple of months ago? It gave a hint at what was to come: In the introduction it specifies “virtual asset trading platforms now in operation have not registered under state or federal securities or commodities laws.” Now, the SEC and the OAG are two very different regulators, with different remits and methods. But the objective is the same: to protect the investor.The OAG’s report goes on to point out that digital asset platforms present an additional risk to the investor – token buyers and sellers can deal directly with them, whereas traditional exchanges operate with the public via the additional buffer of broker-dealers. In the crypto world, the platform is usually the trading venue and the broker-dealer. Even more reason, one can infer, for the regulators to focus their attention on the middlemen.An important detail is that the SEC has not yet prosecuted an exchange – EtherDelta was not the subject of the settlement, its founder was, and he sold the business in December of last year.It will, therefore, be interesting to see what information comes to light in the first case brought against a trading platform for failure to register – and whether we will see crypto exchanges pre-empting the scrutiny by voluntarily doing so.When this happens, we won’t be able to say we didn’t see it coming – and we should welcome the development.While market attention seems to be focused on the ICO cull stemming from the now inevitable cost of security registration – and while it is a huge pity that so many investors will end up losing money on already-issued tokens that disappear as a result – its market impact is more dramatic than meaningful.Exchange registration, on the other hand, will have a deeper impact on crypto assets going forward. It will bring upheaval in some business models, incur significant additional costs in compliance and paperwork, and perhaps trigger a sector concentration.However, and more importantly, greater oversight over the middlemen will lead to the construction of a stronger infrastructure, that can work with regulators and institutions to bring increasing clarity and investment to the asset class.SEC image via Shutterstock"

Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Dec 11, 2018 at 16:35 UTC",Internal chat logs from a town hall held Friday by ethereum production studio ConsenSys show that employees are grappling with uncertainty in the face of recently announced layoffs.,"A day after confirming that 13 percent of its staff would be cut in what CEO Joseph Lubin called a “restructuring of priorities,” company leadership held an all-hands meeting to field questions from members of its roughly 1,200-person team, a meeting documented in a live chat viewed by CoinDesk.“How many months of runway do we have?” asked one anonymous user.“I would like to forfeit my position for a colleague (fired) whom I know will add more value to ConsenSys than me,” wrote one named employee in the chat. “Is that possible?”While CoinDesk was able to observe the company-wide chat in real time, the corresponding, video-streamed answers from ConsenSys leadership were not viewable.Yet because of what appears to be a reticence on the part of ConsenSys staff members to discuss the ongoing situation within the company, the chat logs present the most comprehensive snapshot to date of the major questions still roiling within one of the blockchain industry’s most notable companies.“We are not commenting on internal conversations,” a ConsenSys spokesman told CoinDesk on Tuesday. “Quite frankly, these tactics are beneath you and the role CD plays in the ecosystem as a source of veridical information.”Still, the ConsenSys staff cuts could be a sign of a larger change at the startup, itself comprised of a network of projects and startups all dedicated to building out use cases on the ethereum blockchain. ConsenSys has thus far declined to share which startups, or “spokes,” will be most impacted by the cuts.“We’re taking a careful look at financial sustainability,” Lubin told CoinDesk in an interview last week.On Friday, most chat participants were openly critical of the announced layoffs.“The wave of lay offs felt like re-enacting order 66,” wrote one anonymous staffer, making a “Star Wars” reference. “It looked ruthless and swift. Do the values we claim to profess and hold dear actually hold weight?”“Who is going to be held accountable for the decisions that got us into this situation?” another wrote. “Who and how?”Others asked directly about the financial state of the company, and it’s unclear if they’ve received answers.“Joe [Lubin] earlier today said at the current price [around $85 per ETH] we have many months of runway. Wanted to clarify if that was correct?” one user asked. “Thought runway was previously stated as years.”Though some chat participants used names that correspond with those of current ConsenSys employees, it’s impossible to verify if other outsiders also participated. Even without corresponding answers, the questions themselves reflect internal sentiment as ConsenSys embarks on a course of belt-tightening and business-minded accountability.Criticisms aside, some chat participants struck an optimistic tone about the moves and expressed support for the “ConsenSys 2.0” vision first laid out by Lubin one week prior.“I’m glad ConsenSys went through with this and believe it should have happened much sooner,” wrote an anonymous user. “Far too many people were coasting by on Joe’s benevolence.”“Thank u for all the opps,” wrote one named staffer. “I am more determined than ever to make C2.0 a success and am proud to be here.”While many questions remain, most agree that ConsenSys’ period of rapid growth could not continue.“At some point this needed to happen, but we didn’t expect the change [to come] so fast,” said one recently laid-off ConsenSys employee, who CoinDesk is granting anonymity. “Probably the ETH price forced this to happen.”ConsenSys’ ascent from a famously stickered door in Bushwick to a company with a “mesh” of 50 ventures spanning the globe has been internally funded to date (though Lubin suggested this could change as part of the 2.0 push). And yet while payrolls have skyrocketed as ConsenSys grew, revenues have not kept pace.As Lubin shifts his company toward more accountability and rigor, the business may also be consolidating its leadership ranks.Many employees – both in the Friday town hall and privately to CoinDesk – have said they were surprised by the swift downsizing in a culture that had previously bucked centralized authority.Sources with knowledge of the company have told CoinDesk that more staff cuts are likely.“Why doesn’t the leadership team that got us here feel the need to reveal who they are?” one anonymous employee asked Friday. “What are they afraid of by being honest with the mesh?”ConsenSys image via CoinDesk archives"

with a virtual machine that can execute decentralized applications, ...","Dec 5, 2018 at 05:00 UTC","“If we don’t stop relying on Infura, the vision of ethereum failed.”","That’s how Afri Schoedon, release manager for the Parity Ethereum client, described one of ethereum’s most popular – and controversial – technologies on Twitter in October.Infura handles around 13 billion code request per day and provides a way for developers to connect to ethereum without having to run a full node. And while the exact usage stats aren’t public, by creating a simpler method for interfacing with the network, it’s said to underpin the majority of decentralized applications in the ethereum ecosystem.But here’s the thing: Infura is operated by a single provider – the ethereum development studio ConsenSys – and relies on cloud servers hosted by Amazon. As such, concerns exist that the service represents a single point of failure for the entire network.“If every single dapp in the world is pointed to Infura, and we decided to turn that off, then we could, and the dapps would stop working. That’s the concern and that’s a valid concern,” Michael Wuehler, the co-founder of Infura, told CoinDesk in an interview.While many of the projects recognize the importance of Infura’s contribution to ethereum – referring to the service as a pillar that holds up the developer community today – many, like Schoedon, feel that steps must be taken to seek a decentralized alternative.“There is no point in having dapps connecting through Metamask to a blockchain hosted by someone else,” Schoedon tweeted.And Schoedon isn’t alone in his interpretation. Rather, he’s met by a host of new efforts to dethrone Infura as the go-to connection point for developers linking their decentralized applications to ethereum.For example, new full node incentivizations schemes like VIP node, Dappnode and DeNode seek to provide different kinds of alternatives.Equally, infrastructure minimizing efforts such as light clients are gaining traction, as well as experimental software restructuring like Turbo Geth. And according to developers, what’s at stake is the very decentralization of the ethereum ecosystem itself.“One of the issues that we’re facing in the space today is that decentralized application development is happening through centralized services,” Yalor Mewn, communications officer for Dappnode, a node incentivization scheme, told CoinDesk, adding:“We are building all of this infrastructure on top of a bottleneck.”Currently, there’s a total of 11,803 ethereum full nodes according to available data.Speaking to CoinDesk, Wuehler said Infura accounts for somewhere between 5 and 10 percent of the nodes. Yet because the Infura nodes are highly reliable – under 24 hour maintenance – they’re accounting for a disproportionate amount of traffic.“[We’re] effectively supporting the entire ethereum dapp ecosystem with the RPC traffic,” Wuehler said.And that’s partially because, as of the time of writing, a full archive node is said to take over 1 terabyte of data – beyond what a conventional laptop can store. For developers, as well as users, this means that the storage requirements are frequently outsourced to companies that have the means to manage that kind of infrastructure.“The way Infura works is they host their own full nodes and they open up an [interface] to allow you to easily access those full nodes,” Aidan Hyman, CEO and co-founder of ethereum research and development startup Chainsafe, told CoinDesk.For example, developers frequently opt for Infura as a way to focus their efforts on software, while users are often drawn to in-browser tool Metamask to hold their cryptocurrency. And both route through the ConsenSys full nodes.“Any dapp that uses Metamask also inherently depends on Infura (knowingly, or not). In that sense, nearly all dapps potentially depend on Infura,” Wuehler told CoinDesk.The impact of this is that developers and users are less likely to run full nodes, meaning that the number of full nodes supporting the network decline. As the risk that Infura might become a single point of failure, there are other repercussions to a lack of full nodes as well.Running a full node, for example, allows users and developers to keep much of their sensitive activity local, while Infura accumulates combinations of data from its users such as wallet address and IP locations.“Privacy is an issue,” ‘Dapplion,’ the pseudonymous developer behind Infura replacement project Dappnode, told CoinDesk, adding:“And Infura is hosted on Amazon. So what if Amazon says ‘You know what? Infura no more, just fuck off.’ Most of the dapps would be unusable.”As such, several efforts are trying to find a viable and usable alternative.For example, Parity Technologies has released a new code library for light client development, dubbed LightJS. Parity hopes that it will encourage developers to build light clients rather than relying on Infura as a service.And that’s because, while they promise to be much less hardware and storage intensive, light clients are intended to maintain the same degree as decentralization as running a full node.“Ideally, what we will see is less and less dapps connecting to Infura, and they will use a light client instead to achieve true decentralization,” Parity developer Amaury Martiny told CoinDesk.The Turbo Geth project by Alexey Akhunov also seeks to completely restructure how ethereum software clients handle storage. In the latest version of the software rewrite, he’s decreased the storage requirements down to a fifth of its current size.And several projects, such as Dappnode, Denode, and VIP node, target the underlying incentive layer to encourage more people to run a full node. And that’s because currently, unlike the miners that secure transactions on ethereum, full nodes are not rewarded in any way.But VIP node, working on a grant that has been given by the Ethereum Foundation, uses the identifier with which full nodes connect to ethereum to dole out rewards to nodes that are online, that are paid through a subscription from developers wishing to use the service.Another project, named DeNode, also creates a market between developers and node operators, but tries to decentralize the economic relationship between those actors as well.To do this, DeNode uses a decentralized autonomous organization, or DAO. An initiative by Toronto-based startup Chainsafe, Denode was conceived in May at ethereum hackathon ETH Buenos Aires and is funded through a grant by the Ethereum Community Fund.“The idea that we can build these structures in a decentralized way that allows for the democratization of power dynamics in economic systems,” said Hyman.Finally, Dappnode, founded by blockchain developer Jordi Baylina, takes a different approach by allowing developers to set up a local network that is designed in such the way that it is easy to engage in dapp deployment.“Someone sets it up the Dappnode and gives access to his family, his friends, a trusted circle of person-to-person connections that you have a trust bond. And then just with a couple clicks, as hard as it is to connect to Infura, you will connect to Dappnode,” leading developer Dapplion told CoinDesk.Several of these projects – such as VIP node and Turbo Geth – also receive funding from Infura itself.One of ethereum’s largest startups – the company behind Infura – Consensys is also funding a project, named Incubator, by which is trying to reduce Metamask dependance on Infura on its gateway to ethereum. Infura itself is also trying to diversify the number of cloud providers it relies on, so that it’s not purely reliant on Amazon, according to Wuehler.“Our efforts are mainly about continually trying to push more and more decentralization into the way that our technology stack is delivered,” he told CoinDesk.According to Wuehler, Infura’s popularity is due to a quirk inside the ethereum platform itself. And that’s because, by combining the functionality of bitcoin’s blockchain with a virtual machine that can execute decentralized applications, ethereum generates a wider range of data than simply transactions.For example, as well as relying on a blockchain, ethereum stores what is known as the “state,” which is the sum of all computation on the platform. And as the quantity of ethereum users continue to grow, the size of the state keeps expanding as well.The end result of this is that, as hardware gets increasingly more expensive and complex to operate – and due to ethereum’s underlying design – incentives aren’t in place to encourage people to do this.“We didn’t create the problem, we are just a Band-Aid on the problem. We are just providing a solution that is needed,” Wuehler said.Looking ahead, there’s work being done by ethereum researchers such as founder Vitalik Buterin to find a way to rewrite the underlying incentives so that full nodes can be rewarded for storing data, or what is commonly referred to as “rent.”Such a change is now being considered for inclusion in a proposed upgrade named “ethereum 1x.” Currently targeted for 2019, in the interim, developers are focused on finding solutions that can be deployed immediately.As Hyman from Denode told CoinDesk:“Though we are working as a community on these long term goals we also have to be pragmatic and focus on the present. This is a problem that exists right now and has persisted in the space.”Correction: A former version of this article misspelled Denode as “D-node.”Construct 2017 image courtesy to Steven Gregory"

This enables more efficient agreement procedures as well as significantly higher security and performance.”The first pilot blockchain apps are scheduled for launch in Q2 2019, with use cases said to be focusing on corporates and government agencies desiring to digitize business processes in a “secure and verified” manner.Swiss Post and Swisscom also said they are open to accepting other partners to join them on the project. Ultimately, they desire “to enable the Swiss economy to quickly obtain a leading position when it comes to using this promising technology.”The two companies are already using blockchain technology for several use cases.Swiss Post’s financial services unit PostFinance, for instance, launched a pilot project in May that provides smart energy billing via blockchain.

Still, with so few dapps yet launched it remains to be seen if there’s an appetite for an improved user experience of the decentralized web.Sirin wouldn’t commit to a precise date, but Nimrod May, the company’s chief marketing officer, said the firm projects that shipping will start sometime between Dec. 15 and 25. Sirin has partnered with one of the top electronics manufacturers in the world, Foxconn, to produce the devices.The $999 phone can be pre-ordered now for holders of the sirin (SRN) token. More payment channels will go live soon, and May explained the company will always exchange whatever form of payment buyers use to sirin as it closes each sale.There’s no relationship between SRN and the price of the phone, so those who purchased them in the token sale are at the mercy of the spot price. The token has bounced between $0.06 and $0.18 over the last three months, though trending up and occasionally spiking since last October, according to data site CoinCap.More players have entered the market since the Finney was first proposed. In particular, long-time handset maker HTC has promised a device designed with crypto in mind. Upstart Pundi X has also entered the fray.Sirin’s May declined to give CoinDesk a pre-order figure, but he did give a projection for sales: “I’m pretty confident that we’ll pass the 100,000 in the first year.”As a phone designed to carry around cryptocurrency, Finney makes strong claims about its security.May emphasized the team’s depth of experience in cybersecurity and its application of artificial intelligence to intrusion detection. The phone is also built with a modification of the Android mobile operating system, called SirinOS, which is designed with blockchain functionality in mind.That said, the security feature that will undoubtedly get the most attention will be its cold storage wallet. As May described it to CoinDesk, this wallet is effectively a second device in the same housing as the phone.He said it has a separate processor and users will interact with the wallet on a second LCD screen. Seed phrases will only be inserted through that screen. This can be seen in a design video released by the company.In order to get people to use new apps in the company’s “dCenter” or decentralized app store, Sirin will make it easy for app makers to send Finney users free tokens.“We incentivize the user by incentivizing with airdrops,” May said.Sirin Labs has said from the start that Finney aims to make crypto easier to use.For example, if users want to use different apps, they shouldn’t have to think about paying in the right form of crypto. Finney has been built to convert between different tokens as needed. At launch, it will only convert BTC, ETH and SRN.When CoinDesk first reported on Finney, the firm’s plan had been to use the Bancor network to run its swapping. May says swapping will now run on Sirin’s own software.One of the tokens running in the dapp store will be the sirin token. “The sirin token is designed as a utility token from the beginning,” May said.Its only utility, for now, is phone pre-orders. Later, it is meant to run Finney-specific features, such as allowing phone users to sell each other bandwidth on the go. A forthcoming software development kit will allow engineers to brainstorm and advance their own peer-to-peer use cases.Much as with Bancor, the original plan had been to power these services with the Iota protocol, as previously reported, but Sirin Labs no longer plans to do so. SRN runs on the ethereum blockchain, for now.Finney phone image courtesy of Sirin Labs"

so- ...","Nov 19, 2018 at 09:00 UTC",Michael J. Casey is the chairman of CoinDesk’s advisory board and a senior advisor for blockchain research at MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative.,"The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly,  a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers.The most commonly cited number for comparing the worth of different crypto projects is market capitalization. It is an extremely flawed metric.Critics note, for example, that poor liquidity, combined with lax rules at many exchanges, let founders and large holders easily manipulate market cap quotes at sites such as CoinMarketCap. This made for all sorts of abuses during the ICO mania of last year.But there’s a deeper, philosophical problem with market capitalization. Because it’s benchmarked in dollars, this measure (which simply reflects a token’s price multiplied by the number of issued tokens) implicitly judges the success of each crypto project in terms of some expected future fiat currency “exit.”For an industry rooted in efforts to reinvent money and create alternative, non-fiat forms of value exchange, that’s a contradiction. And it encourages bad behavior.Prioritizing the dollar-based return on investment fosters communities of coin-pumping fanatics, rather than those of passionate software and business developers focused on building successful decentralized crypto-economic projects.Yet the day traders and YouTube advisors, ubiquitous as they are, do not hold a monopoly over crypto culture. There are still plenty of people drawn to this technology for reasons other than making a quick buck flipping coins.More than any other type of asset, crypto tokens are defined by the communities they attract: ad hoc collectives of individuals motivated by a freely formed belief in an idea, a unique proposition for decentralizing an economic ecosystem. Not every token’s core idea is a good one, of course, but the point is that the enthusiasm in the idea is a key determinant of a project’s value.That passion also varies greatly, especially in the degrees to which it manifests as a real commitment to developing the technology and the community. If we are to truly measure the value of these assets, we must also find ways to quantify those qualities, which are, by definition, independent of each token’s dollar-based price.This is why I’m excited by the CoinDesk data team’s launch of its Crypto-Economics Explorer. Not only does it use a more relevant crypto benchmark than the dollar – bitcoin – it also downplays the significance of price itself as a measure of value.The Explorer offers a weighted, multi-dimensional representation of value incorporating a variety of objective measures of engagement and interest in each crypto project. Price/market cap is just one of five chosen dimensions. The others are developer activity, on-exchange transactions, on-blockchain transactions and social media activity.If you compare each coin through this lens – give it a shot; this easy-to-use tool includes a useful zoom function – you’ll find that it opens a whole new way of understanding the particular drivers of community engagement and communal interest in each project.Zcash, for example, is heavily skewed toward developer engagement, presumably reflecting the passion that many cryptographers have for the pro-privacy zero-knowledge-proof technology that underpins the coin. But it has very few transactions and very little social media engagement.The profile for XRP, by contrast, is dominated by social media engagement, perhaps reflecting the “XRP Army’s” vocal presence on Twitter and other sites, as well as the fact that much development is done in-house by Ripple.Ripple critics might be tempted to see this as proof that XRP is all show and no substance. But by the bitcoin benchmark-based terms of the Crypto Explorer itself, community development is an important factor in any crypto project’s value, and social media is a relevant proxy for that.Already, critics have attacked the choice of bitcoin as the benchmark, presumably viewing that status as supporting the biases of so-called “bitcoin maximalists.”A benchmark that’s built on some kind of weighted average of all coins might have assuaged such concerns, but that would be unnecessarily complicated. It’s important to note that the 100 percent score for bitcoin on all five dimensions doesn’t reflect an absolute; it is simply a basis for comparison. As explained in backing documents, it is perfectly possible for a competing coin to outscore bitcoin on any or all of those metrics – in other words, to get more than 100 percent.The model is, in this sense, no different from that of world foreign exchange markets, which use the U.S. dollar as their benchmark. On a purely numerical basis, one could say the British pound and the euro – currently at $1.28 and $1.14, respectively – are both “worth more” than the dollar. Of course, that would be meaningless. The point is to have some basis for comparison in time.In choosing a benchmark, CoinDesk had to start somewhere. And, by the measures chosen, bitcoin is without a doubt the granddaddy of crypto coins. In the future, perhaps some other composite could be used in its case. But for now, this is a perfectly good starting point for a model of comparative value.Still, it’s important to note that, as with any standard of value, the choices made in the Crypto-Economics Explorer’s methodology are, by definition, arbitrary. They are not based on some absolute truth.The good news is that CoinDesk regards this project as a work in progress and, in the words of Editor-in-Chief Pete Rizzo, is inviting the community leaders to “beat our tool up. Kick it to death.” Collaborative iteration will lead to an ever-improving model.So dive into the methodology. Perhaps you can think of an alternative benchmark to bitcoin. Perhaps there are good arguments for changing the weightings within each category. Should mining revenue account for more or less of the 20 percent at which it is currently weighted within the Explorer’s “Network” measure? Are there other metrics that are relevant to measure developer activity beyond the eight GitHub-derived numbers?This is a starting point, not an end point. But it’s a great place to start reframing the conversation around what we should be valuing in the cryptocurrency universe.And the timing couldn’t be better.No. Not because the dollar prices of crypto assets tanked last week and we need some other, non-price distraction, but because institutional investors are on the verge of entering the market and it’s vital that they set aside their dollar-centric valuation models and recognize that value is a different concept in the crypto world.These new big players talk about crypto as “a new asset class” – as if crypto tokens are just an alternative store of value, not too dissimilar to a stock, bond or commodity, that will one day bring them dollar returns when they cash out back into fiat. Yet what they’re really “buying” by investing in a crypto token is exposure to the whims of a community who’ve formed around a core idea. And quite often that idea has as its objective the disintermediation of the very institutions from which this new breed of investors comes. There’s some confused, contradictory logic in investing in something that’s designed to kill you.Regardless, the deep pockets of these investors have the potential to add significantly more volatility to the single metric of price for many token projects. So, as even more attention goes to the traders, it’s great that we have a model with which to point out that there are other ways of looking at this industry other than with dollars.Image via Shutterstock"

Research. News; Learn; Research. Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Nov 25, 2018 at 10:30 UTC","Having left one of the world’s largest financial institutions to build an ethereum startup, Amber Baldet appreciates both the needs of enterprises and the potential of open, decentralized blockchains. ","But in the Clovyr co-founder’s view, it’s too soon for the former to start doing much with the latter.“We want to build those bridges out to the public networks, but I don’t think you get there by shoving public chains down enterprises’ throats before they are ready,” Baldet told CoinDesk.Rather, a gradual process of bridge-building between public chains and the private kind favored by corporations is needed, believes Baldet. This is the task Clovyr was designed to perform, while keeping decentralization front and centre. “Until there is credible on-chain privacy or very well-designed privacy preserving architectures for enterprise applications on public chains, it’s a bit premature,” said Baldet, who oversaw the creation of Quorum, the private and privacy-centric fork of ethereum, when she was the blockchain lead at global megabank JPMorgan Chase.Baldet, who formed Clovyr in May with ex-Quorum engineer Patrick Nielsen, was in London to announce a partnership with IHS Markit & Fintech Open Source Foundation (FINOS) to build their Decentralized Ecosystem program.Earlier this month at Devcon 4, Clovyr released its first standalone tool, a code search for ethereum developers writing smart contracts in Solidity, the programming language.Baldet’s comments come as enterprises, once dead-set against public chains, are tentatively exploring the possibilities there. The 500-member Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, for instance, is developing standards which will port privacy-enhancing modifications into ethereum, and global consulting firm EY has championed enterprise use of public chains.On the other hand, some enterprise blockchain builders, such as the R3 banking consortium, believe the full-broadcast design of public chains, which is naturally disposed to sharing data with other nodes, is fundamentally the wrong architecture for businesses. Another immediate concern is scale: Baldet said a single large enterprise moving any portion of its core operations to the ethereum blockchain would shut it down faster than CryptoKitties, the popular tokenized cat game that inundated the network with transactions. Rather than being overloaded with computational complexity and burdened with a ton of smart contacts, a better endpoint for the public ethereum network is to be “a connective fabric between things that are happening elsewhere,” she said.Even in her banking days, Baldet espoused cypherpunk ideals about privacy. In her view, it is critical, not only so enterprises can protect their secret sauces, but also for human consent over how the data we generate is handled. Hence, Baldet wants to make building and connecting decentralized applications (not necessarily blockchain-based ones) easy and intuitive, while eschewing centrally controlled, data-hungry surveillance capitalism. Yet Clovyr also takes a practical approach. An example, said Baldet, could be something simple like creating a workflow for document signing and verification across different entities within a business, where DocuSign might have been previously used. In that scenario, “you don’t need to do a $20 million infrastructure lift of an existing application, so much as you simply enable that connectivity – and from there it’s a more organic way to build the ‘blockchain use case.’ You don’t need to get 10 organizations around a table with a bunch of lawyers and spend six months deciding everything up front,” said Baldet. While the blockchains being built by enterprise consortiums like R3 and Hyperledger will solve business problems of their target demographic, there’s much more on offer, she said, adding: “What we have right now is great for the 1 percent of businesses that can afford the expensive consultants and pay for the use case creation.”But like history, software development moves in cycles. ColdFusion, a scripting language used for web development in the 1990s, required expensive consultants, noted Baldet. Thereafter, a rapid period of evolution led to a point where thousands of mom-and-pop shops were registering dot-com addresses with reusable e-commerce carts they didn’t build themselves.“So we want to create those reusable components that dramatically lower the barrier to entry for the 99.99% of people in the world who have not even begun to explore what blockchain can mean to their business,” Baldet said. Regarding Clovyr’s business model, Baldet said she wanted to clarify that it is not a “dapp store” nor is it a pure interoperability play like Hyperledger Quilt or Polkadot. And while Clovyr makes it easier to search libraries and use them to spin up networks, Baldet is careful not to have the model conflated with the notion of “blockchain-as-a-service.”“Right now, what we have is everything that is ‘as a service’ comes to you from a central provider. Yes, we are creating that experience for developers, but we are not trying to create an intermediary that forces what they build to constantly phone home to Clovyr,” she said, concluding: “Delivering the usability modern developers expect in a privacy-first way isn’t easy, but it’s a problem worth solving.”Image via Consensus"

Firms may also be required to form a subsidiary to carry out the ICO.Finally, SGX RegCo expects listed issuers of ICOs to “safeguard” their own interests and that of shareholders. “The issuer’s board is ultimately responsible for maintaining a robust system of risk management and internal controls,” Gin said.Back in August, Y Ventures Group became Singapore’s first public firm to hold an ICO, which aimed to raise $50 million for creating a blockchain-based e-commerce system.To date, however, no token considered a security has been approved in the country by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), as Damien Pang, head of the MAS technology infrastructure office for fintech and innovation, told CoinDesk at a Consensus conference in September.SGX image via Shutterstock "

Corcoran, a long-time veteran of the trust company industry, to head the crypto security startup’s institutional custody business.","Announced Thursday, Corcoran will oversee billions of dollars in value as CEO of a recently formed division called BitGo Trust Company, one of a growing field of crypto custodians courting hedge funds, family offices and mutual funds as clients.  “I understand the regulatory requirements and how to comply with those standards and maintain compliance as we serve customers,” Corcoran told CoinDesk, adding that the first big-ticket clients are now being on-boarded. Indeed, Corcoran is especially familiar with the requirements of South Dakota, which granted BitGo a trust company license earlier this year, allowing the firm to hold cryptocurrency on behalf of institutional investors. He retired from First National Bank in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, in 2016, after 25 years leading its trust department. That same year he met Mike Belshe, BitGo’s CEO.“We met through the attorney representing BitGo who recommended that Mike talk to me about the trust industry in South Dakota in general,” Corcoran said, adding, somewhat cheekily:“I think it was a setup.”Stepping back, institutional investors are generally required by U.S. law to use qualified custodians rather than safekeep assets themselves. Although banks and broker-dealers can act as qualified custodians, the state trust company license has proved popular among crypto specialists such as BitGo, Kingdom Trust (which is also registered in South Dakota) and Coinbase (which set up a regulated trust company in New York this year).South Dakota is “if not the top, one of the top trust jurisdictions in the country, and that’s because of our very favourable trust laws and the manner in which we monitor these laws,” said Corcoran, who served on the South Dakota Governor’s Task Force on Trust Administration and Reform. “When I came here in 1979 there were a total of 12 trust institutions; now there are over 100 independent trust companies alone here,” he added.An attorney by training who reportedly helped draft more than half a dozen statutes, Corcoran explained that being a chartered trust company in South Dakota involves certain basic requirements. These, he said, include governance structure and accountability; compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act’s anti-money-laundering strictures; insurance coverage; periodic external audits; and capital reserve levels. “From a banking standards view, I think we would be considered well capitalized,” he said.BitGo CEO Mike Belshe at Consensus: Invest 2018, image via CoinDesk archives."

In a repo, securities are sold to an entity, with the seller agreeing to repurchase them at a pre-set future date and price. They are effectively short term loans.For the trial, Sberbank acted as the seller, Region as the buyer and the NSD as a settlement agent. The deal was for a Russian rouble-denominated OTC repo secured by government loan bonds. The value of the instrument was not disclosed.Utilizing blockchain allowed the three parties to automate various parts of the process, including the execution of margins, settlement and repository reporting. The deal was governed by local laws and was a binding financial contract that was signed electronically using a smart contract, the bank said.Andrey Shemetov, Sberbank’s vice president and head of the global markets department, said:“The combination of smart contracts and distributed register technology makes financial contracts more transparent and increases security for both clients and the bank.”He added, “We are confident that the market will adopt our technology as a new standard for carrying out OTC repo deals and market players will appreciate all the advantages it offers.”Earlier this year, Sberbank launched a blockchain laboratory to develop and test blockchain-based business solutions. In May, it also teamed up with telecoms firm MTS to conduct commercial bond transactions worth $12 million using blockchain.Financial institutions elsewhere are also exploring blockchain as a means to settle transactions in various financial instruments. Just yesterday, four European banks – Commerzbank, ING, Natixis and Rabobank – settled a live transaction for a short-term debt instrument on the Corda platform developed by blockchain consortium startup R3.And, last month, Singapore’s central bank and the country’s stock exchange developed a settlement system using smart contracts to simplify post-trade processes and shorten the settlement cycle.Sberbank image via Shutterstock "

The number of clients is up from 114 on Sept. 30, 2017, marking an increase of 323 percent.Its primary customers are crypto exchanges, with $793 million in deposits; institutional investors such as hedge funds and VC funds taking a focus on crypto assets, with $573 million in deposits; and other firms including new protocol developers and miners, with $227 million in deposits.“The majority of our funding comes from noninterest bearing deposits associated with clients in the digital currency industry,” Silvergate states, adding that that “unique source of funding” offers an advantage over traditional financial institutions. Those deposits are invested into interest-earning deposits at other banks and investment securities, as well as into lending opportunities “that provide attractive risk-adjusted returns,” it says.Capitalizing on its crypto relationships, the firm has developed its own crypto infrastructure, called the Silvergate Exchange Network (SEN) – a network of digital currency exchanges and investors that, it says, allows “the efficient movement of U.S. dollars between participating digital currency exchanges and investors” around the clock.SEN was developed and tested in 2017 with some customers and opened up to all crypto-related customers in early 2018.Bullishly, the corporation believes that the market for crypto-related financial services infrastructure solutions and services is “significant” and will grow as the crypto market grows. The addressable market for fiat currency deposits related to cryptocurrencies is possibly worth $30–$40 billion, it added, citing various research.For its IPO, the bank is seeking to raise $50 million and aims to list on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol SI.“We intend to continue focusing on our digital currency initiative as the core of our future strategy and direction,” said Silvergate.Featured image courtesy of Silvergate"

VAT is a form of consumption tax levied on goods and services.Ekniti Nitithanprapas, director-general of the Revenue Department was quoted as saying that blockchain would help verify VAT invoices and in turn help eliminate any that were not genuine. The agency is also reportedly planning to tap other emerging technologies such as machine learning, artificial intelligence and Big Data to prevent tax evasion and fraud.The news comes after a similar move by a tax authority in China back in May. At the time, the Shenzhen National Taxation Bureau partnered with internet giant Tencent to use blockchain in the fight against tax evasion.The project was aimed to create digital invoice on a blockchain platform as proof of purchase for goods and services, again with the purpose of combating fake invoices and “improve the invoice supervision process.”Thailand is starting to embrace blockchain technology in other areas too. In June, the country’s central bank, the Bank of Thailand, said it was carrying out a trial of its own cryptocurrency aimed to make interbank transactions both faster and cheaper.And, in July, a self-regulatory organization called the Thailand Bond Market Association said it was developing a private blockchain system to speed up corporate bond settlement in the country.Thailand Revenue Department image via Shutterstock "

Such malware is designed to secretly reallocate an infected machine’s processing power to mine cryptocurrencies, with any proceeds going to the attacker.According to Kaspersky, more users were infected in September than in January and “the threat is still current,” though it is unclear whether the recent collapse in the crypto markets’ prices will have an impact on the infection rate.The firm’s analysts said that a noticeable drop in distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks may be attributable to “the ‘reprofiling’ of botnets from DDoS attacks to cryptocurrency mining.”As the note detailed:“Evidence suggests that the owners of many well-known botnets have switched their attack vector toward mining. For example, the DDoS activity of the Yoyo botnet dropped dramatically, although there is no data about it being dismantled.”A possible explanation for cybercriminals’ increased interest in crypto-mining may lie in the fact that once the malware is distributed, it’s difficult for victims and police to detect.Of the various types of software identified and cataloged, most reconfigure a computer’s processor usage to allocate a small amount to mining, keeping users from noticing.The organization further looked into reasons for the prevalence of this type of malware in some regions over others, concluding that regions with a lax legislative framework on pirated and illicitly distributed software are more likely to have victims of cryptojacking.U.S. users were the least affected by the attacks, constituting 1.33 percent of the total number detected, followed by users in Switzerland and Britain. However, countries with lax piracy laws like Kazkhstan, Vietnam and Indonesia topped the list.“The more freely unlicensed software is distributed, the more miners there are. This is confirmed by our statistics, which indicates that miners most often land on victim computers together with pirated software,” the report said.Image via Shutterstock"

Please be aware of potential scammers,” the bank told CoinDesk in an email response.It added:“The only way to participate in Union Bank AG’s coin offerings is via a direct contact with the bank. There are no websites for contributions or sign-ups, and no wallet addresses are available publicly or privately to send coins or fiat money.”“Because ICOs are sold over the internet and pitched heavily through social media platforms, North Dakotans can be exposed to the offers whether the promoter is down the street or on the other side of the globe,” Tyler said, adding:“Financial criminals continue to cash in on the hype and excitement around blockchain, crypto assets, and ICOs – investors should be exceedingly cautious when considering a related investment.”This is not the first time the watchdog has taken action against companies promoting suspect ICOs in the state.

In particular, said co-founder Mason Borda, having a broker-dealer license grants the company the ability to provide services that the original technology firm could not, primarily revolving around issuance and management.Prior to acquiring the license, TokenSoft’s customers would have had to coordinate with another firm or determine the appropriate steps themselves for some of the process.To bring about the move, said Borda, the firm bought a 20 percent stake in a regulated broker-dealer called Marpine Securities LLC, which has now rebranded to the new affiliate. The companies will remain as two distinct entities with separate leadership teams, however.Initially, the company plans to provide referral services to custody providers or exchanges, meaning the firm will help token issuers set up accounts and services with the providers.TokenSoft Global Markets will be able to manage ICOs on issuers’ behalf as well, with the company providing support for each stage of the process, on top of its existing compliance platform. The company will also provide marketing support.Other services will also be offered going forward, though there are no firm plans yet, according to Borda.“We’ve been evaluating what sorts of business opportunities … we can have under TokenSoft Global Markets,” he said, adding:“TokenSoft brings a lot of technological expertise that’s not on the market right now, when it comes to security … when it comes to compliance.

For safety reasons, there are strict requirements regarding the qualification of personnel,” Pallecchi said, explaining the need for a robust identity system.The solution was developed by a blockchain startup Linum Labs using the open-source technology of uPort, a project started under the umbrella of New York-based ethereum design studio ConsenSys.In the proof-of-concept, workers created their digital identities in the uPort app on their mobile devices, and SBB issued them certificates confirming they went through appropriate training.The workers then used these digital IDs while signing in and out of construction sites where they worked. To enter the site, a worker would scan a QR code from the app on his or her cellphone.“Using uPort, railway workers, certification authorities and supervisors are able to have their own unique digital identities linked to their respective uPort ID’s, which is then anchored to an identity on the blockchain. A hash of the worker’s check-in / check-out activities is published to the blockchain so that the internal database can be audited,” Linum Labs wrote in a Medium post.The app can also connect to identity systems authorized by city administrations, like Zug ID, which also uses uPort’s tech. It was trialed this summer in the Swiss city of Zug to enable electronic voting via blockchain, and now is involved in another pilot: local residents can use Zug IDs to unlock bikes provided by AirBie, a Zurich-based bike-sharing startup.SBB’s Pallecchi declined to give any specific details about next steps, adding that the company “may have more stable information” in the beginning of 2019.uPort hasn’t been directly involved in the railway project, in accordance with the startup’s open-source ethos, its head of product, Thierry Bonfante, told CoinDesk. “Our partners are representing our system on the market. We’ll just make sure that they have all they need from us,” he said.However, while the railway pilot was underway, in August, uPort upgraded its architecture to address scalability and privacy concerns, moving more operations off-chain. As uPort is based on ethereum, which has struggled to scale, doing every operation on blockchain was making the system slow and ineffective, Bonfante said.Another issue that prompted the change at uPort: it was difficult to comply with the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) implemented in May. The regulation includes a “right to be forgotten,” which is, to demand that information about an individual be removed from the public domain at their request.“If you always put your information on the blockchain it’s irrevocable,” said Bonfante. “So you have lost your right to be forgotten.”With the new architecture of uPort, users’ personal information is stored off-chain, on their mobile phones. In the case of the Swiss railway, “blockchain is only used for additional key management purposes, such as key rotation, revocation and delegation to third parties,” Bonfante explained.The system works well for small amounts of information, uPort’s director of business operations, Alice Nawfal, told CoinDesk. But in the future, as the market gets to the point where more complex identity applications will be in demand, “it probably will not work on a phone,” so uPort is looking into creating a storage hub solution, Nawfal said.She added that SBB “really grasped” the opportunities of the verifiable credentials technology.“Before this, the use cases were, for example, that people were able to identify that they are residents of a particular city,” Nawfal said. “And the railways are going with a more complex implementation with certification and multiple credentials.”Swiss railroad image via Shutterstock"

In fact, the dominance rate for XRP, an indicator that tracks the percent of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization contributed by the cryptocurrency, reached a 45-week high of on 12.74 on Nov. 20 (it has since retreated slightly to just above 11 percent). For comparison, bitcoin’s (BTC) dominance rate is currently 53.9 percent while the rate of ether, now the world’s third-largest cryptocurrency registers 9 percent. Notably, since XRP began its market share uptick on Nov. 15, the broader cryptocurrency market has witnessed a significant sell-off, losing nearly $90 billion and 40 percent of its total market capitalization to date.Needless to say, the market rout has resulted in significant depreciation to many if not all cryptocurrencies against the U.S. dollar. XRP and ETH are reporting 22 percent and 37 percent respective losses in the 11-day span while the world’s largest cryptocurrency is down 32 percent.Despite XRP’s advance in the market capitalization ranks, ETH, has recorded significantly more trading volume as of late. In the last 24 hours alone, ETH’s exchange volume of $2.47 billion is nearly twice as large as XRP’s $1.3 billion, according to CoinDesk’s Crypto-Economic Explorer (CEX).Disclosure: The author holds BTC, AST, REQ, OMG, FUEL, 1st and AMP at the time of writing.Bitcoin Ripple image via Shutterstock"

Research. News; Learn; Research. Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Nov 26, 2018 at 14:00 UTC","Since raising $6 million in a 2017 initial coin offering (ICO), porn startup SpankChain has differentiated itself from the token-sale pack by actually delivering a platform with thousands of users.","Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, SpankChain boasted 6,136 active users as of October, and has paid roughly $72,422 in cryptocurrency to 31 webcam models since the site launched in April. Several freelance SpankChain performers say they are now earning more on SpankChain than any mainstream porn site.“I crunched the numbers,” performer River Sunshine, who has been camming for five years, told CoinDesk. “I was making on three sites combined, 6 percent of what I made in the same 30-day period on SpankChain.”Fellow performer Molly Mae Meow, who has been camming for more than six years, said she too makes much more money on SpankChain, which only charges performers 5 percent of their earnings compared to the standard 50 percent across the industry.“I think a lot of members appreciate that I’m getting almost the whole amount of it,” Mae Meow said, adding:“I was a little skeptical about all of it at first. But now I really, really love crypto.”Sunshine and Mae Meow are examples of sex industry veterans who were introduced to cryptocurrency through SpankChain. They generally cash out the platform’s ethereum-based SPANK tokens as needed for weekly expenses, storing the rest as some form of digital asset for long-term savings.“I feel more in control of my money than I did using the banks and payment processors on other sites,” Sunshine said.Word of SpankChain’s lucrative platform is spreading across performers’ social networks. According to SpankChain’s internal data, every week around 20 new performers sign up to join.Speaking to how “staking” SpankChain tokens on the platform, or locking them up and earning rewards for letting those tokens fuel the network, offers models a way to essentially control something comparable to equity.Mae Meow said: “Giving models that much power in your site can be very beneficial. You’re not just working on the site, everyone on the site is also working for you.”Of course, this raises a thorny question: Is SPANK an unregistered security under U.S. law, exposing SpankChain to regulatory risk?It’s too soon to say what legal classification staked tokens will eventually have given how U.S. regulators are cracking down on token issuers that, like this sex industry startup, considered their assets “utility tokens” rather than investments.“The question is how people perceive them and use them,” Preston Byrne, a partner at the law firm Byrne & Storm, P.C., told CoinDesk.He went on to add that, generally speaking, any token system that doesn’t include mechanisms to prevent speculative trading could present some risk from a securities law perspective.“Token issuers are setting them up for an almost impossible task,” Byrne said. Referring to the test created in a Supreme Court case for determining what is an investment contract, he added, “the Howey Test is deliberately extremely broad.”However, SpankChain CEO Ameen Soleimani told token holders, via the company’s public discord channel, that he’s not concerned about regulators hindering the ecosystem’s growth because the team “never discussed price appreciation of the token” and “deliberately tried to keep SPANK off the major exchanges.”Soleimani went on to say his company has not been contacted by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and would happily cooperate with such regulators.One aspect that complicates questions about SPANK is that SpankChain’s webcam platform itself isn’t the startup’s long-term revenue strategy. Instead, the webcam site is essentially a proof-of-concept for SpankChain’s crypto payment processing, using SPANK’s stake system, which Soleimani hopes porn companies across the industry will switch to as an alternative to traditional payment processors.As such, despite SpankChain’s popularity among performers, the overall sentiment in the broader ethereum ecosystem recently prompted layoffs at the startup.Without commenting on how many people were laid off on November 20, Soleimani told CoinDesk in a statement:“While we’re immensely proud of the impact of Spank.live, our main revenue model is based on the adoption of our SpankPay wallet across the adult industry—and that’s going to take some time…in the face of the bear market, SpankChain had to slim down and refocus our company efforts on shipping.”On the other hand, tokenized holdings aren’t the only opportunity attracting SpankChain’s performers to the network.In addition to gaining more control over their income, SpankChain models noted that the crypto-powered platform offers more creative freedom than other camming sites.For example, mainstream platforms that work with credit card processors often ban fetish performances, such as Disney princess roleplay or knife-play with real fake blood (though real knives). For Mae Meow, joining SpankChain opened up a whole new world of possibilities.“I love doing some taboo shows and I can’t do that on other sites without the fear of getting shut down,” Mae Meow said. “I love dressing up and doing Halloween stuff.”At the same time, increased financial censorship since SESTA-FOSTA bills passed through Congress earlier this year is forcing many performers offline to more dangerous, public environments.Sunshine agreed, saying that after those laws passed having control over her own cash out process was crucial. SpankChain’s system, like many blockchain platforms, allows for immediate access to funds because there’s no waiting to deal with credit card chargebacks.“I have more a sense of freedom to do [unconventional content],” Sunshine said, adding she now prefers crypto over any fiat alternative. “I wish I could pay my rent and bills directly from my crypto wallet.”Another distinction both Mae Meow and Sunshine noticed is that SpankChain users, predominantly veteran crypto fans, are less demanding and open to more diverse content, such as cooking shows, than general audiences. Instead of trolls demanding performers immediately get raunchy, as they often do on other sites, SpankChain viewers have generally been happy to let performers set the tone.“You have control over the show,” Sunshine said. “It’s honestly changed my life. I feel excited to get on cam now.”Molly Mae Meow image via SpankChain"

Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Dec 10, 2018 at 19:05 UTC",U.S. insurance group State Farm is testing blockchain tech as part of a new platform for insurance subrogation.,"State Farm announced Monday that it was trialing a blockchain solution to streamline the manual process of subrogation. Subrogation is the legal right for companies to pursue damages from a third-party responsible for causing a loss to the insured party.The trial is currently aimed at determining whether a blockchain platform is a “viable product for insurance industry adoption,” according to a press statement. State Farm is a notable entry on the list of firms testing blockchain, having ranked 36 on the Fortune 500 list for 2018.State Farm explained that during an auto claim, two insurance firms would determine the claim amount. The insurer for the party at-fault for damages would pay the insurer for the other party.Some $11 billion in claims were transferred due to subrogation in 2017, a spokesperson for State Farm explained in an email, with $750 million dealing with private-passenger insurance claims.“Today, subrogation is a relatively manual, time-consuming process often requiring physical checks to be mailed on a claim-by-claim basis between insurers,” State Farm innovation executive Mike Fields explained in a statement. By contrast, using a blockchain platform would provide a number of benefits, he said, adding:“It helps us automate a manual process securely and creates a permanent transaction record of each payment which can easily be verified for accuracy. It also has the potential to decrease the amount of time for consumers to receive their deductible reimbursement.”In an email, the State Farm spokesperson added that the blockchain solution may reduce the risk of an error in processing a claim due to the way the platform’s validation process. It would also decrease the number of paper checks sent from one insurer to another.Innovation manager Dustin Helland added that the team was looking at the immutability of a blockchain as another benefit from the technology.The test will run through the first half of 2019, alongside existing subrogation processes. Helland added that “the results of the test, along with other factors, will be input for a decision on whether or not to launch the solution into full production adoption.”Image Credit: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com"

Research. News; Learn; Research. Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Nov 28, 2018 at 11:00 UTC","One of the top U.S. financial regulators, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), has released its second guide to understanding smart contracts, with a reminder that the technology is covered under financial rules.","Announced Tuesday, the primer is part of agency’s fintech initiative LabCFTC. Described as an “educational tool” rather than official policy, it covers the basics of blockchain smart contracts including their history, characteristics, case studies, potential use cases and perceived risks.Stating that the concept of a smart contract was discovered some 20 years ago by computer scientist Nick Szabo, the CFTC states that the self-executing programs are only as smart as the “information feed it receives and the machine code that directs it.”The agency says that smart contracts can offer the benefits of reduced costs and transaction times, lowered counterparty and settlement risks, and increased security. At the same time, though, they present challenges, including operational, technical and cybersecurity risks, alongside the potential for fraud, manipulation, reduced transparency and accountability, says the CFTC.On the topic of regulation, the CFTC points out that that smart contracts are subject to existing laws, including the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and anti-money laundering (AML) rules, depending on their application or the type of product they are linked to.“Existing law and regulation apply equally regardless what form a contract takes. Contracts or constituent parts of contracts that are written in code are subject to otherwise applicable law and regulation,” the primer reads.In order to protect investors and their capital, the agency said, it will ensure that all transactions are subject to the CEA.The LabCFTC initiative was launched in May last year and the first primer was released in October 2017 on virtual currencies covers the basics of the technology, as well as a number of use cases.The guide also comes just over a month after a Brian Quintenz, a commissioner at the CFTC, warned that smart contract coders could be held liable if they knowingly use the technology to create functions that are considered predictive “event contracts.”CFTC image via Shutterstock "
