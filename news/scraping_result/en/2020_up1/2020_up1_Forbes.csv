In fact, there were only two major cryptocurrencies that outperformed Bitcoin in 2019.On Friday morning, Nexo co-founder Antoni Trenchev told Bloomberg’s Matt Miller why he thinks the Bitcoin price could continue to rise to the $50,000 mark in 2020.“I think that, very easily, we could see Bitcoin going up to $50,000 by the end of this year,” said Trenchev.Trenchev’s Nexo platform allows users to borrow fiat currency against their cryptocurrency holdings. According to Nexo’s researchers and analysts, a massive rise in the Bitcoin price could occur due to the upcoming halving event. A halving event in Bitcoin is when the amount of Bitcoin generated by the network roughly every ten minutes is cut in half. This event takes place about every four years.“The last time this happened, Bitcoin rallied 4,000%,” noted Trenchev.Trenchev also pointed out that Bitcoin is mostly uncorrelated to the rest of the market, providing asymmetric returns for holders of the cryptocurrency.Miller pointed out that Bitcoin hasn’t grown much as a payment option since he tried to live on the digital currency for a Bloomberg investigative report back in 2012, but Trenchev claimed the main selling point of Bitcoin has evolved over the years.“The initial idea was: We’re going to pay for coffees with Bitcoin,” said Trenchev. “But, obviously, that has failed to materialize. The narrative, now, that is much more persuasive is that Bitcoin is the new gold, and we see confirmation with the turmoil that we have this morning — Bitcoin is rallying on par with gold.”Trenchev added that the Bitcoin price would reach the $50,000 level if the crypto asset is able to take hold of 10% of the current gold market. The Nexo co-founder claimed that, eventually, people will only be able to afford to buy satoshis rather than whole Bitcoins for their portfolios.Members of the cryptocurrency industry are not the only ones who are aware of Bitcoin’s potential, as members of the United States Congress also envision a world where this technology could have a major impact on society. Congressman Patrick McHenry (R-NC) has said Bitcoin has enormous long term value, while Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA) is worried about the cryptocurrency’s potential impact on the U.S. dollar as the major reserve currency in the world."

","The bitcoin price, up some 40% since the beginning of 2020, smashed through the key $10,000 barrier to hit highs of $10,127 on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange earlier this evening—adding 4% over the last 24-hour trading period. The bitcoin price has been flirting with $10,000 for the last few weeks. The sudden jump in the bitcoin price comes as bitcoin traders and investors are gearing up for the looming May bitcoin halving event, which will see the number of bitcoin rewarded to miners cut by half. ""Bitcoin just hit $10,000,"" Anthony Pompliano, the cofounder of bitcoin and crypto investment group Morgan Creek Digital, said via Twitter. ""I still think that bitcoin will hit $100,000 by end of December 2021,"" pointing to bitcoin's ""fixed supply"" and ""increasing demand"" as the reason for bitcoin's performance. In May, the coin reward for mining new bitcoin blocks is scheduled to drop from 12.5 bitcoin to 6.25 bitcoin–cutting the supply of new bitcoin coming onto the market by half.There have already been two bitcoin halvings since bitcoin launched in 2009, one in 2012 and another in 2016. Bitcoin halvings are scheduled to continue roughly once every four years until the maximum supply of 21 million bitcoins has been generated by the network—something that won't happen until well into the next century. Many are hoping the 2020 bitcoin halving will see a repeat of the last cut to supply. Bitcoin prices doubled in 2016 and soared 13-fold the following year. ""Fireworks in store,"" Travis Kling, who runs Ikigai Asset Management, said last month, adding the coming bitcoin halving will see ""five years of trend lines perfectly coinciding with the most highly-anticipated event in bitcoin history.""Meanwhile, the number of people searching Google for the term ""bitcoin halving"" has been steadily rising along with the bitcoin price. Analysts at Arcane Research have said that an increase in searches could be a sign bitcoin's halving will recapture the wider public interest in bitcoin and crypto that catapulted the bitcoin price to around $20,000 in 2017.The bitcoin price has been climbing steadily throughout the first few weeks of 2020. However, not everyone is celebrating the bitcoin halving with one U.S. wealth manager, Andy Edstrom, recently suggesting it isn't necessarily something that's fundamentally good for bitcoin or the bitcoin price.""When hash power drops, that's a good time to attack the bitcoin network,"" Edstrom told Citizen Bitcoin podcast host Brady Swenson last month. ""The halving is the one time attackers can prepare and know there are marginally profitably miners active that they can push out.""Elsewhere, bitcoin bulls are looking forward to a number of other key developments in 2020. Bitcoin is expected to be upgraded in a so-called soft fork later this year, a development that's been called ""one of the most innovative additions"" that bitcoin's had.The soft fork, which is a change to a cryptocurrency's protocol that doesn't require all nodes to be updated and is backward-compatible, is expected to improve bitcoin's privacy and scalability.Alongside technical developments, a newly announced consumer app for bitcoin and cryptocurrency purchases from bitcoin futures exchange Bakkt will launch in the first half of 2020. U.S. coffee chain Starbucks will be its first launch partner, with the company one of the original backers of the crypto project, along with software giant Microsoft and Boston Consulting Group."

valuation roughly doubling itself over the course of twelve months.","Jan 19, 2020,10:10pm EST",Getty,"2019 was a positive year for the Bitcoin price, with the crypto asset’s valuation roughly doubling itself over the course of twelve months. Although Bitcoin declined heavily over the second half of 2019, it has started off 2020 with a bang.So, what’s to be expected in 2020? Here are five major trends to watch for in Bitcoin this year.The Bitcoin halving coming up in May is a key aspect of the bull case for Bitcoin in 2020. This is a scheduled occurrence that takes place roughly every four years where the number of new Bitcoin generated around every ten minutes is cut in half. Instead of 12.5 Bitcoin being included as a subsidy for miners in every block, 6.25 Bitcoin will now be generated instead.Opinions are split in terms of thoughts on how this event will affect the Bitcoin price and whether it’s already priced into the market. Either way, it should be noted that the only two previous halvings in Bitcoin’s history led to significant appreciations in the crypto asset’s price in the months that followed.The excitement around “The Halveninig” led to one industry executive to predict a $50,000 Bitcoin price by the end of 2020.Bitcoin has been referred to as digital gold for a number of years, but 2019 was the year when that meme became much more realistic, according to data from the last six months of the year. In fact, the idea of Bitcoin as digital gold became so prevalent in 2019 that U.S. Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA) claimed the crypto asset may be a threat to the U.S. dollar’s dominance in the global economy.At the start of 2020, the similarities between Bitcoin’s and gold’s price movements around increased tensions between the United States and Iran did not no unnoticed. However, longer-term measurements of the correlation between Bitcoin and gold still indicate there is a very weak correlation between these two assets. The digital gold use case is often referred to as Bitcoin’s core value proposition, so a closer correlation with physical gold could indicate a greater level of understanding and acceptance of this point from market participants. Additionally, the introduction of central bank-issued digital currencies could clarify the value proposition of something like Bitcoin in the minds of the general public.Unlike some of the smaller cryptocurrencies out there, Bitcoin does not see serious upgrades happen very often (and for good reason). That said, a major change could take place in 2020.Schnorr, Taproot, and Tapscript are all expected to be included in the same soft-forking upgrade of the Bitcoin network. A finalized proposal for the activation of these improvements by Bitcoin nodes could be ready as early as this year. Currently, developers are reviewing code related to these potential changes, which are expected to improve privacy, smart contract functionality, and general scalability of the Bitcoin network.Developments are also taking place on layers above the base Bitcoin protocol. The Lightning Network has been hyped as a solution for faster, cheaper Bitcoin micropayments for a number of years now, and Blockstream’s Liquid sidechain has seen growth in terms of the amount of Bitcoin and Tether US available on the platform over the past few months.Although the Lightning Network has enjoyed a greater level of attention up to this point, it may be Liquid that takes the spotlight in 2020. Due to the large amount of centralization of Bitcoin transactions around exchanges, Liquid could be helpful in lowering congestion on the base Bitcoin blockchain in a situation where there is a large amount of speculation around the Bitcoin price, possibly due to the halving.In a scenario where demand for block space stays relatively stagnant, it’s possible that neither of these secondary Bitcoin protocol layers will see much growth this year, as the incentive to change old habits is much weaker.There is a belief among many Bitcoin technologists that innovations like sidechains and the Lightning Network will eventually send the price of alternative crypto assets to zero. Notably, the altcoin market as a whole is down quite substantially against Bitcoin over the past two years.And, of course, the final Bitcoin trend to watch in 2020 is adoption by institutional investors. Adoption from institutions has been hyped for many years, but this is not something that happens overnight.2019 saw the SEC approval of the first ‘40 Act-regulated Bitcoin fund, which has led one analyst to believe that a Bitcoin ETF approval could be right around the corner. Additionally, Grayscale recently announced inflows of $600 million in new money from investors, mostly from hedge funds. Last week, a survey also found that that financial advisors may be increasing the exposure of their clients’ assets to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies this year."

Among the top ten biggest cryptocurrencies by value, bitcoin SV, an offshoot of bitcoin cash, which is itself an offshoot of the original bitcoin, has recorded the sharpest rise so far this year, rising 209%. Bitcoin SV, which broke away from bitcoin cash in 2018 and is controlled by the controversial Australian computer scientist Craig Wright, rocketed higher last month following reports Wright has acquired documents that might help prove he had a hand in bitcoin's creation a little over 10 years ago.The claim has been widely ridiculed by the bitcoin and cryptocurrency community and Wright has so far failed to backup his claims. Bitcoin cash is, meanwhile, up 113%. ""While prices appear to be increasing and substantial growth is happening in terms of institutional product offerings and regulatory clarity, there are still significant unknowns hovering over the market at large,"" researchers at bitcoin and crypto trading platform SFOX said this week, leaving their market outlook at ""neutral.""Bitcoin remains the prime cryptocurrency market mover, however, with its dominance, a measure of bitcoin's value compared to the wider crypto market, at 64.2%—up from just over 50% in February 2019. ""It’s not clear whether bitcoin will function as a safe haven in coming geopolitical turmoil; it’s not clear how much institutional appetite is actually there for all the institutional crypto offerings being launched; and it’s not clear what impact the upcoming bitcoin block reward halving, just four months away, will have on the price of bitcoin,"" SFOX analysts added. All other top ten cryptocurrencies, excluding stablecoin tether, have also risen even further than bitcoin so far this year. The second most valuable cryptocurrency, ethereum, is up 60%, while the third, Ripple's XRP, is up 47%. Ripple's chief executive Brad Garlinghouse marked XRP's year-to-date performance, tweeting his annoyance at former billionaire hedge fund manager-turned-bitcoin and crypto investor Mike Novogratz's suggestion XRP will have another lackluster year in 2020, asking for a ""factcheck.""Ripple's XRP lost 46% of its value last year.Despite bitcoin's recent rally, the price has a long way to go to reach last year's high of around ... [+] $14,000 per bitcoin. Elsewhere, litecoin, known as the silver to bitcoin's gold, is up 78%, with ethereum-rival EOS adding 77% so far in 2020. Rounding out the top ten, binance coin, cardano, and tezos are up 43%, 87%, and 62% respectively.

end of the year, the Bitcoin Suisse CEO offered key developments to 
watch ...","Jan 17, 2020,12:01pm EST",Getty,"Bitcoin Suisse CEO Arthur Vayloyan was interviewed by CNN Swizterland on Monday, and during his appearance on the network, Vayloyan discussed various reasons to be excited about Bitcoin and other crypto assets in 2020. While Vayloyan did not offer a specific Bitcoin price prediction for the end of the year, the Bitcoin Suisse CEO offered key developments to watch for in the crypto market.According to Vayloyan, fundamental improvements have been been continuing behind the scenes despite Bitcoin’s price drop over the past six months.A point that Vayloyan hit on multiple times during his interview is Bitcoin’s upcoming halving event, which is expected to take place in May. A halving is a scheduled change to Bitcoin’s issuance rate that is programmed to take place on the network every four years. This year, the number of new Bitcoin generated in every block will drop from 12.5 to 6.25.After referring to Bitcoin as the “mother of all cryptos,” Vayloyan went on to explain how halvings, which have only happened twice before in Bitcoin’s history, have affected the price in the past.“When you look back and take history a little bit as a prediction or at least an idea of what could happen, it so happens that price movements are actually quite positive in those years or in the year that followed,” said Vayloyan.There has been an intense debate between cryptocurrency pundits over whether the halving is already priced into the Bitcoin market. In terms of his view on what will happen, Vayloyan stated, “It will be interesting, but I would say the general rule is it will go up.”Bitcoin’s halvings are part of the system’s predictable monetary policy, which is a key part of the comparisons with gold that are often made with the crypto asset. Notably, data from 2019 indicates Bitcoin recently took a major step towards turning this comparison into more than just a meme.Another key point Vayloyan brought up during his appearance on CNN Switzerland was that the Bitcoin and crypto market has become much more mature over the past decade.“Crypto assets, in general, are here to stay,” said Vayloyan. “Why am I so sure about this? Because when you look at the last ten years and you take it forward, we have seen a major change in the participants. Before, it was the interested technical people with a high affinity to something new. But more and more we see now institutionals coming in — be it the banks, be it the central banks even. And they look at the technical opportunity that stands behind the crypto technology.”Vayloyan later reiterated this point about the mature Bitcoin market.“I think, after ten years, it’s fair to say that it has reached a fair level of maturity,” said Vayloyan. “And maybe the best gauge I can give: looking at the institutionals — those who have assets from their clients — they have an extra fiduciary responsibility to look at it. And they come in and look at it and do things.”Earlier this week, a survey of financial advisors shed some light on why some of them are adding Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to client portfolios.When asked for some key talking points for the crypto asset market in 2020, Vayloyan provided three answers.Vayloyan was also asked for his thoughts on Facebook’s Libra announcement from last year. While Vayloyan is cautious on whether the project will ultimately succeed in its current form, he also pointed out how the announcement was a positive moment for the cryptocurrency space.“I was extremely excited when Libra came on the market space because every board member in the world in the financial arena woke up when it came to cryptocurrencies,” said Vayloyan.Facebook’s Libra announcement ended up being a learning experience for many people who did not understand the differences between Bitcoin and traditional online banking, and it’s possible a similar phenomenon could occur when central banks eventually get into the digital currency game.Another industry executive has been more brazen than Vayloyan and outright predicted a $50,000 Bitcoin price for 2020. Additionally, ETF Trends CEO Tom Lydon has pegged the chances of a Bitcoin ETF approval for this year at 60%."

""The more individual cases that are identified, the more countries around the world that are affected, and the greater the impact on traditional financial markets, the higher the price of bitcoin has jumped,"" Green said. Others have suggested bitcoin has a lot to gain as market confidence falls. ""As trust in global institutions and markets continues to deteriorate, we will see highly mobile digital assets like bitcoin explode in value,"" Jehan Chu, managing partner with blockchain investment and advisory firm Kenetic Capital, told Bloomberg, a financial newswire.Not everyone is confident bitcoin's recent gains can be attributed to fears around the spreading coronavirus, though. ""Whatever's happening in the stocks doesn't seem to be having any affect on the cryptomarket whatsoever,"" Mati Greenspan, the founder of research group Quantum Economics wrote in a note. ""Crypto is neither acting like a safe haven in the face of the virus, nor is it selling off with the other risk assets. Rather, it remains completely uncorrelated.""Just last week investors were warned the latest bitcoin rally might have come too fast and gone too far.Analysis of bitcoin technical data revealed the bitcoin price was above the upper-band limit of the GTI Vera Band Indicator—something that has twice recently signaled an imminent correction.Back in July, the GTI Vera Band Indicator flashed warning signs before bitcoin began its steady fall from almost $10,000 per bitcoin to lows of around $6,600 seen in December.The bitcoin price has resisted fears it might be due a correction, with the price adding some 30% ...

(Photo by Chesnot/Getty Images),"Bitcoin prices have enjoyed notable gains lately, rising more than 25% since the start of the year. The digital currency reached $9,009.53 this morning, its highest since November 11th, CoinDesk figures show. The cryptocurrency attained this 2020 high after rising to nearly $8,900 on January 15th, falling back to less than $8,600 and then mounting a subsequent recovery, additional CoinDesk data reveals. Analysts cited many variables when explaining bitcoin’s so-called New Year’s rally, including Iranian tensions, anticipation surrounding the upcoming halving and the perception that the digital asset was oversold when the New Year began. [Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.]Rising VolatilityAs bitcoin rallied this year, the digital currency’s 30-day volatility climbed as well, reaching its highest in more than seven weeks on January 14th, according to figures provided by independent cryptocurrency analyst David Martin. On that particular day, bitcoin’s 30-day volatility rose to 62%, its highest since November 23rd, said Martin. While this figure represented the highest value of 2020, it was still slightly below the cryptocurrency’s average volatility reading of 63% over the last six months. In other words, bitcoin’s price volatility has picked up lately, but this was after the digital asset was relatively stagnant for the last few weeks of 2019, trading primarily within a relatively modest range between $7,000 and $7,500, CoinDesk figures show. The chart below helps illustrate these developments: Bitcoin's price, 30-day and 60-day volatility. Altcoin RallyOne factor that analysts have cited as bolstering both the price of bitcoin and the broader digital currency markets is the rally in altcoins (cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin) that took place earlier this week. Several of these digital assets enjoyed compelling gains, with bitcoin SV, an offshoot of the original bitcoin, skyrocketing more than 200% in a matter of days on CoinMarketCap. This sharp run up was attributed to rumors that Craig Wright, an Australian computer scientist who claims he created bitcoin, received keys to the s0-called Tulip Trust, an entity that supposedly contains over 1 million bitcoin. While Bitcoin SV’s response was clearly significant, the run up was entirely speculative, said Tim Enneking, managing director of Digital Capital Management. Skyrocketing Interest In AltcoinsThe interest in many prominent altcoins has surged lately, according to data on social media activity provided by digital analytics platform TheTIE.io. This robust activity helps provide a sense of the interest that traders have in these digital assets. “We are seeing absolutely massive spikes in the number of twitter users discussing altcoins,” said Joshua Frank, cofounder of TheTIE.io. “BCH, BSV, ETC, and DASH which have all hit their highest tweet volumes since last summer,” he stated. “Bitcoin Cash, for example, exceeded 2,000 daily tweets on January 13th for only the second time since December 2018.”The chart below helps illustrate this activity: This chart shows the twitter activity surrounding some prominent altcoins. Market OutlookIn the short-term, bitcoin prices may consolidate for a while, trading within a reasonably narrow range until one or more developments cause it to break to the upside or the downside, according to technical analysis provided by Joe DiPasquale, CEO of cryptocurrency hedge fund manager BitBull Capital. “Bitcoin started January around $7,200 but quickly rose above the resistance levels at $7,500, $7,700 and $8,000 by January 8, 2020,” he noted. “After that move, Bitcoin price continued to test the new support levels (previous resistance levels) at $7,700 and $8,000, before going on to try the next resistance zone between $8,700 and $9,100,” added DiPasquale. “For now, the price has decent support at $8,500 with the 150-day moving average, but the RSI is entering overbought territory, which indicates we may see further consolidation in this range in the absence of market catalysts,” he stated.

(Photo Illustration by Avishek Das/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images),"Bitcoin, similar to gold, is a good hedge against global uncertainties like trade wars.That's according to a lengthy working paper out from the Department of Economics of the University of Pretoria, ""Is Bitcoin the New Digital Gold? Evidence From Extreme Price Movements In Financial Markets.""The paper tests a popular claim in the media that Bitcoin has joined the ranks of safe-haven assets. These are assets where investors place their cash at the time of growing global uncertainties, as they flee risky assets like stocks. koyfin_20200115_110609569US Treasuries, gold, and the Swiss Franc have been considered safe-haven assets.Now come Gkillas Konstantinos and François Longin, the authors of the paper, to confirm this assertion by using the multivariate extreme value theory.That's the appropriate statistical framework to model the tail dependence structure of the return distribution.What did they find? Two things.First, they confirmed the findings of previous studies — ""that the correlation of extreme returns increases during stock market crashes and decreases during stock market booms.""Second, they confirmed Bitcoin is a hedge against turbulent times.""By combining each equity market with bitcoin, we find that the correlation of extreme returns sharply decreases during both market booms and crashes, indicating that bitcoin could provide the sought-after benefits of diversification during turbulent times,"" say the authors. ""A similar result is obtained for gold, confirming its well-recognized status as a safe haven when a crisis occurs. Finally, we find a low extreme correlation between bitcoin and gold, which implies that both assets can be used together in times of turbulence in financial markets to protect equity positions."" Still, Jim Powers, Director of Investment Research at Delegate Advisors, isn't convinced.""Bitcoin is not the new gold because the old gold (i.e., gold) still works just fine,"" he says. ""While similarities exist between gold and Bitcoin (e.g., store of value, price determined by supply and demand), gold has been recognized as a store of value for millennia. Bitcoin has been recognized as a store of value for less than a decade.""Then there's Bitcoin's reliance on the Internet. ""In an end-of-the-world-style financial apocalypse, individuals can still hold and trade physical gold,” adds Powers. “Try buying a loaf of bread with Bitcoin if the Internet stops working.""  "

Notably, Singh shared what turned out to be a correct prediction that Bitcoin would get close to $15,000 in 2019 with Bloomberg a little more than a year ago.“This year, I’m going to make a prediction,” Singh told Bloomberg’s Taylor Riggs on Wednesday. “I think Bitcoin passes the all-time high and goes past $20,000 this year.”While most other Bitcoin pundits have pointed to the upcoming halving as the main catalyst for a Bitcoin price pump in 2020, Singh offered an alternative theory. The halving event is expected to occur in May, and it will cut the number of new Bitcoin that are created roughly every ten minutes in half.“The technical and high-frequency trading is what drives this market in Bitcoin,” said Singh. “Any time you have an unforeseen circumstance like the Iran incident that happened a couple of days ago that adds new buyers to the market, they weren’t expecting that and that bumps it up. And that little bump actually in buying pressure really drives it to be up, next thing you know, 20% in two days.”In Signh’s view, the Bitcoin market is largely driven by traders who follow technical indicators, which is why unforeseen events where new buyers enter the market have had such a large impact on the cryptocurrency’s past price movements. Singh pointed to last year’s surprise announcement from Facebook about their Libra project as an example of this phenomenon.“This year, again, things like China, Russia, or India could legalize Bitcoin,” added Singh. “Some new companies competitive to Facebook could get involved. The American government could do something. Something unforeseen that could happen will really move it faster.”Singh also pointed out that fundamental building blocks for a stronger Bitcoin ecosystem are already here through developments like the launch of Fidelity’s crypto services and Square’s hiring engineers to focus on Bitcoin. However, he reiterated that it will be the unforeseen events that trigger big Bitcoin price moves in 2020.In terms of the crypto asset market more generally, it’s unclear if other coins would rise as quickly as Bitcoin in a bull market, as 2019 was a historically bad year for altcoins. The development of secondary protocol layers, such as sidechains, on top of the base Bitcoin blockchain, could spell doom for many of the alternative assets in the crypto market. Even a member of the United States House of Representatives has singled out Bitcoin as the real innovation in the crypto asset space."

","Bitcoin prices rallied today, reaching their loftiest value since mid-November as the broader market pushed higher. The digital currency climbed to $8,848.92 at roughly 1:15 p.m. EST, according to CoinDesk data. At this point, the cryptocurrency was up 3.6% for the day, and was trading at its highest level since November 12th, additional CoinDesk figures reveal. The digital asset has been following a broad, upward trend for the last several days, pushing higher after reaching a 2020 low of $6852.09 on January 3rd. [Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.]When explaining bitcoin’s recent gains, analysts cited both technical and fundamental factors. Christopher Brookins, founder and CIO at Valiendero Digital Assets, spoke to these developments. “The sharp move is the confluence of uptick in fundamentals” and technicals, he stated. “I think the bottom is firmly in,” said Brookins, pointing to the “strong uptick” in bitcoin’s hash rate and his analysis of the Hurst exponent, a momentum indicator that helps determine the strength of a trend. The digital currency was “very oversold at the end of Q4,” he added. Joe DiPasquale, CEO of cryptocurrency hedge fund manager BitBull Capital, offered a similar perspective, also stating that bitcoin’s recent gains were “driven by a mix of fundamental and technical factors.” “First, the digital currency appreciated during the US-Iran tensions, going from $6,860 to $8,460,” he stated. “This move took it above our previously cited support level at $7,700.” “Then, new developments in Craig Wright's legal battle fueled speculations regarding him being Satoshi Nakamoto (and potentially having control over the billions worth of initially mined Bitcoins), pushing up Bitcoin SV, and by association, Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin,” noted DiPasquale. More specifically, there are rumors circulating that Wright has received the final keys for him to unlock the so-called Tulip Trust, which supposedly holds more than 1.1 million units of bitcoin. Bitcoin SV has skyrocketed lately, its price up more than 90% in the last 24 hours at the time of this report, CoinMarketCap figures showed. However, this rally is a completely “speculative move,” said Tim Enneking, managing director of Digital Capital Management. Short-Term Outlook Going forward, market observers might benefit from watching a handful of key price levels, noted analysts. “Persistent buying momentum (at the moment, it looks like RSI will push towards 80) has allowed bitcoin to retest/break key resistance of $8442 and is currently completing a Kumo breakout,” said Brookins. “If that holds, it would confirm a resumption of the bull trend,” he stated. However, Brookins added that “in classic crypto form, bitcoin is trying to regain all of its Q4 loses in 2 weeks.”“So, it's overbought right now, but I wouldn't stand in front of the train for a reversal just yet.”“As long as $8442 (now support) holds after RSI decompresses, the bulls are in control again,” stated Brookins. Ramak J. Sedigh, founder & CEO of Plouton Mining, also weighed in. “A quick look at the trading volume shows a huge increase parallel to the price increases,” he stated. “So unless we break out of the 8800 and 9000 resistance levels this is just another price manipulation - intentional or not. So it’s bound to come back to re-test the lows.”For now, bitcoin’s recent price rally “looks too much too quickly,” he stated. Disclosure: I own some bitcoin, bitcoin cash, litecoin, ether and EOS. "

Bitcoin (BTC) is flight/safe haven capital and the global fear of this outbreak is creating demand for BTC. For me it is the indicator of the spread or otherwise of this worrying disease. 2) The Halvening. Coming in May, likely the 12th, this will drop the mining reward to 6.25 BTC from 12.5. The idea is that this will make bitcoin worth twice what it is now. Maybe it will, maybe it won’t but it certainly won’t make BTC cheaper and if demand for new coins is constant, it will drive the price up over time.So here is the chart of what we can expect with no shocks cropping up:How the Bitcoin price should move if nothing unexpected happensIt’s hard not to imagine a moonshot happens next but there is nothing to mandate it. When coronavirus is controlled we can expect a pull back but as I keep reminding myself, the future of the world is full of such events to try our patience and pump “fiat” into flight capital.Much above $11,000 and BTC will look very exciting indeed.If Bitcoin goes over $11,000 things will look excitingNow something interesting struck me this morning that I hadn’t recognized. Inflation is the same in the U.S., Europe and the U.K: U.S. 1.9%; EU 1.93%; U.K. 1.94%.That’s a lightbulb moment for me because it shows that this block is synced up in monetary policy at the hip. This has all sorts of consequences I’ll have to noodle on for weeks and many investing implications and opportunities, but the interesting thing for bitcoin is after the halvening the BTC inflation rate will be: 1.83%This should mean on its own, that bitcoin’s value should rise in terms of a basket of these currencies as its inflation will be below theirs and provide a hedge and carry. This is only marginal but it won’t take much of a rise in inflation to start to make a significant widening. There are many forces driving asset price inflation but the best returns are to be had on assets that are in finite supply. Bitcoin has a finite supply and the consequent upward price pressure is gong to be enhanced by new supply being less than inflation and significantly less than real global growth of 3%.From Forbes: Stay informed and ahead of the crowd with Forbes Crypto Confidential, a free weekly e-letter delivered to your inbox.

In fact, there was a large amount of hype surrounding the potential for Ethereum to overtake Bitcoin as the largest and most popular crypto asset on the market back in 2016. However, the Ethereum price has fallen quite considerably against Bitcoin since that time.There are a number of reasons to believe that Bitcoin will remain king of the cryptocurrency market, whether based on technical innovations or simple network effects. And the altcoin market as a whole has performed rather horribly against Bitcoin over the past couple of years, with only two major altcoins outperforming Bitcoin in 2019.Recently, Dragonfly Capital Founding Partner Alex Pack and Dragonfly Capital Managing Partner Haseeb Qureshi chatted with Laura Shin on an episode of Unchained. During the conversation, Qureshi shared a personal story related to the reality that Bitcoin has already won the competition to be digital gold.Before telling his story regarding Bitcoin’s role as the king of cryptocurrencies, Qureshi shared his belief that Bitcoin’s Lightning Network is something for which there is not much demand. The second-layer Bitcoin protocol has been built in an effort to offer faster, cheaper payments while retaining an acceptable level of decentralization (see here for a more in-depth explanation).While Lightning-based payments have been hyped in the Bitcoin space for a number of years at this point, Bitcoin’s payments layer has not gained as much traction as some originally thought it would.“It’s not a hard explanation that Bitcoin — clearly, most of the reason why people want [Bitcoin] is to hold it, not to transact for small amounts of money,” said Qureshi of Lightning’s slow pace of adoption.It was this discussion around the Lightning Network that led to a more general point regarding Bitcoin’s utility as a store of value. Shin asked Qureshi what would happen to Bitcoin if the Lightning Network does not work out.“All of the sidechains and things like RSK — any augmentations on top of Bitcoin — have really been tiny ornaments on top of what the real market is,” responded Qureshi. “The real market is: I want to buy and hold Bitcoin because I see it as a digital store of value. That, overwhelmingly, is, I think, what Bitcoin is going to be used for. And that sort of use case, actually, is totally fine with the state of Bitcoin clearing today.”Qureshi added that he does not expect Bitcoin to change much over time, though additional layers, such as the Liquid sidechain, and marginal improvements for efficiency and privacy will continue to develop.“Yeah, I think the idea that Bitcoin would ever be a medium of exchange has always been a bit of a libertarian pipe dream,” added Pack.According to Haseeb, he was drawn in by the additional development capabilities of Ethereum when he first got into the cryptocurrency space on a full-time basis. He saw Bitcoin as an outdated technology that couldn’t do much and thought Ethereum would clearly surpass Bitcoin as the most widely used and held crypto asset at some point.“But the reality, of course, is that Bitcoin is a lot more than just an open source project,” said Haseeb. “And at the time, I just really didn’t grasp that.”Haseeb added that his belief that Ethereum would overtake Bitcoin was held during the ICO bubble, when the hype around Ethereum was at its peak. According to Haseeb, Bitcoin’s key value proposition became more obvious over a short period of time.“The fact that it’s so static, the fact that it doesn’t change, is a large part of what makes Bitcoin so valuable,” Haseeb told Shin. “And it’s a property that Ethereum cannot emulate because Ethereum is trying to be a different thing. It’s not trying to be digital gold. It’s not trying to be the unalterable vision of 21 million [coins], deflationary, [and] store of value.”Haseeb pointed to a quote from The Wire in relation to Ethereum’s failure to overtake Bitcoin during the ICO bubble: “You come at the king, you best not miss.”“Once [Ethereum] aimed at Bitcoin and missed, I think, sort of, the game is over,” explained Haseeb. “Bitcoin kinda wins. And it’s pretty hard for anybody, at this point, to dethrone Bitcoin as being the claimant to what will be the digital store of value or digital gold.”To Haseeb’s point, data shows Bitcoin took a major step forward in terms of acting as a digital gold in 2019. Additionally, industry executives have made Bitcoin price predictions ranging from $20,000 to $50,000 for this year, with one analyst commenting that there’s a 60% chance a Bitcoin ETF happens in 2020."

However, bitcoin doesn't appear to be performing quite like traditional investment safe havens. ""I think the total valuation on 10 years that I use is about $8 trillion and that comes from various buckets,"" said Edstrom. ""Whether it’s taking share from gold, or taking share from fiat, or taking share from offshore assets, or slightly demonetizing other stores of value like real estate or new uses that we haven’t thought of, or are still under construction, such as micro payments.""If bitcoin were to reach a total valuation of $8 trillion, the cryptocurrency would be worth around the same as the entire gold market. Elsewhere, Mike Novogratz, the former billionaire hedge fund manager and chief executive of bitcoin and cryptocurrency investment company Galaxy Digital, has previously made similar bitcoin price predictions, claiming bitcoin could ""easily"" reach a similar market cap to gold’s $7.5 trillion over the next 20 years.""Some would say that's aggressive, some would say it's conservative,"" Edstrom said. ""But getting to multiple trillions of value on a ten-year view could either happen through hyper-bitcoinization or its just part of the evolution and it's in the next decade it happens.""Bitcoin broke out of its year-long bear market last year but has failed to return to its all-time ...

Further, “global regulators are working in conjunction to harmonise rules on AML KYC, travel rule and general standards for exchanges and custodians to operate by.” “This gives standardisation across national jurisdictions which allows for certainty of business and derisks for companies involved.”Disclosure: I own some bitcoin, bitcoin cash, litecoin, ether and EOS.

","After the head of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards' elite Quds Force, general Qasem Soleimani, was killed by U.S. forces in Iraq it was widely reported the bitcoin price in Iran had soared to around $24,000—this is, however, based on a common misunderstanding of exchange rates in Iran.

Iran-based bitcoin sellers on peer-to-peer trading platform LocalBitcoins were seen to be pricing bitcoin at around 1 billion Iranian rials, worth some $24,000 based on the official exchange rate set by Iran's central bank.However, the official exchange rate set by the Central Bank of Iran is only ever used by the government and a handful of businesses. Almost all people and businesses in Iran use a market set exchange rate when converting rials to U.S. dollars—that currently has rials priced at around a third of the official exchange rate. ""The going market rate for the U.S. dollar to the Iranian rial is one dollar to 136,500 rials,"" explained Mehran Jalali, an Iranian national who follows the crypto market and splits his time between the U.S. and Iran. ""The current bitcoin to rial rate posted on Iranian crypto exchange websites is around one bitcoin to 984,000,000 rials, equal to $7,208 per bitcoin in Iran, which is very close to the going rate everywhere else."" ""The official rate is what the central bank says. But literally, no one except some government organizations can get that rate while no one can use it,"" crypto expert Ali Beikverdi told bitcoin news site Cointelegraph. ""It’s a joke.""Bitcoin has been known to trade at a small premium in some places around the world, though never at the levels incorrectly reported in Iran. In South Korea, the bitcoin price traded around 10% higher until early 2018 when the country introduced tighter regulation. Elsewhere, bitcoin can regularly see a premium of around 4% in Hong Kong due China's strict bitcoin trading ban forcing people who want to buy bitcoin to use the stablecoin tether. Meanwhile, some bitcoin and cryptocurrency watchers dismissed suggestions bitcoin was acting as a safe-haven asset in response to the U.S. killing of Iran's general Soleimani.""Heightened geopolitical risk has resulted in both gold and bitcoin moving higher, but for different reasons,"" Peter Schiff, the chief executive of Euro Pacific Capital and outspoken bitcoin critic, said via Twitter. ""Gold is being bought by investors as a safe haven. Bitcoin is being bought by speculators betting that investors will buy it as a safe haven.""The bitcoin price leaped this week but has been steadily falling for the past six months.Last year, some in Iran turned to bitcoin to try to evade U.S. sanctions on the country. ""With exchange offices closed, sanctions and the rial dropping like crazy it seems like a good idea to use bitcoin,"" one person in Iran, who wished to remain anonymous, said at the time, adding bitcoin was ""literally the only way to get money out of the country."""

The digital currency declined to as little as $9,752.20 this morning, after climbing to roughly $10,200 on Saturday, CoinDesk data shows. Since then, the cryptocurrency has been trading mostly between $9,800 and $10,000, additional CoinDesk figures reveal. [Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.]When explaining these latest price movements, market observers pointed largely to technical factors. “The recent rally had also entered into the overbought zone, exhausting bulls and resulting in the current decline,” said Joe DiPasquale, CEO of cryptocurrency hedge fund manager BitBull Capital. Now, the digital currency is trying to “establish a support level in the zone between $9,800 and $10,000,” he stated. Going forward, “we can expect some consolidation in the current range before technical indicators cool down and Bitcoin makes another move above $10,000,” added DiPasquale. Jon Pearlstone, publisher of the newsletter CryptoPatterns, also weighed in. “Studying the daily chart since the most recent lows in December 2019 shows a continued grinding up pattern, and this continues around the $9500-$10500 range,” he stated. “There are bullish signs here but for now we are testing this key price range that has been hit multiple times over the last 18 months,” said Pearlstone. “Our pattern analysis indicates 2 months of grinding higher is a sign of a growing trading market with a bullish edge (currently) that means a lot more than the psychological price level of $10000,” he stated. Kiana Danial, CEO of Invest Diva, also commented on this bullish trend. “Bitcoin has entered a long-term uptrend, however, unlike the bubble of 2017, this time around its gains are more measured,” she stated. “That means, instead of just moving up out of hype, short-term investors take the time to take profit and get back in for more,” said Danial. “This time around we could see drops to as low as $9,500 or even $9,000 before we see the next move towards $11,000,” she noted. “This is a much healthier long-term uptrend for Bitcoin, which could sustain a lot longer and prevent a catastrophic crash.”Disclosure: I own some bitcoin, bitcoin cash, litecoin, ether and EOS."

A more specific version of this argument comes in the form of Bitcoin eventually being overtaken by a new digital currency owned and operated by a government or corporation.However, this theory is based on a complete misunderstanding of why Bitcoin is useful in the first place. In reality, central bank-issued digital currencies, such as the project being worked on in China, would only further solidify Bitcoin’s role as an uncontrolled, apolitical form of money in a digital age.It is sometimes easier to understand Bitcoin’s value proposition when the current move towards a cashless society is extrapolated out another ten or twenty years down the road. If governments are in complete control of the world’s financial system at that time, then the situation looks rather grim, with it becoming much easier to track all transactions, inflate the money supply, seize savings, and strengthen other forms of financial control over the general public.This is why it is necessary for something like Bitcoin to exist. And the utility of Bitcoin as a difficult to seize, censor, or inflate asset where each individual is in complete control of their money becomes much more apparent in this dystopian scenario.Indeed, a recent report indicates Bitcoin’s lack of correlation to traditional financial assets as a key driving force behind financial advisors adding the crypto asset to their clients’ portfolios. Data from 2019 appears to back this thesis of Bitcoin’s growing utility as a “digital gold” of sorts.In terms of competition from other cryptocurrencies meant to be decentralized, many investors think the competition to become the major digital store of value is already over. The altcoin market’s severely poor performance against Bitcoin over the past couple of years lends support to this thesis. Additionally, the further development of innovations like sidechains could make matters even worse for alternative crypto assets like Ether and Ripple’s XRP.Of course, Bitcoin is far from perfect as it exists today. For example, one large miner recently warned that better privacy is needed in the cryptocurrency network.The idea that central banked-issued digital currencies would help make the case for Bitcoin is not completely theoretical, as a similar phenomenon already took place last year with Facebook’s Libra announcement. The level of centralization involved with Facebook’s digital payments initiative was a learning experience for people who didn’t quite understand what Bitcoin was all about. One U.S. congressman even recommended Facebook simply adopt Bitcoin instead of creating a new digital currency from scratch.Additionally, Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA) appears to understand the threat Bitcoin represents to the United States’s control over the global economy, pointing out that Bitcoin is intended to displace the U.S. dollar as the reserve currency for most of the world.At least one industry executive believes the Bitcoin price will reach $50,000 in 2020 due to this potential utility of Bitcoin as an apolitical store of value for the entire world."

Tezos, trading as XTZ, has risen by 10% over the last 24-hour trading period, taking its year-to-date gains to almost 50% and giving it a market capitalization of around $1.4 billion. At the beginning of the year, tezos was the 15th most valuable cryptocurrency by market capitalization, according to CoinMarketCap data, but has now climbed to 11th—and is in touching distance of the top ten.Tezos, which styles itself as a ""self-amending cryptographic ledger"" and uses the so-called proof of stake consensus model, has emerged as a favourite blockchain and cryptocurrency for tokenized real-estate and security tokens. Tezos holders, if their funds are stored in certain wallets, can ""stake"" their XTZ and receive additional tokens as a reward for creating and verifying new blocks in the chain. The tezos rally, which began in November last year, has been pushed on by major partnerships with the financial world and the so-called Tezos Foundation’s Faucet, that awards users up to 0.01 XTZ every 12 hours. Last year, Brazil's BTG Pactual bank and Dalma Capital, a Dubai-based asset manager, announced they would use the tezos blockchain for security tokens. Meanwhile, Elevated Returns said it would use tezos to tokenize its real estate in Aspen. The tezos price has outperformed bitcoin and most other cryptocurrencies over the last 12-months. Tezos’ XTZ tokens began trading in late 2017 at the height of global bitcoin and crypto mania after the Switzerland-based non-profit Tezos Foundation raised $232 million in an initial coin offering. At its peak, tezos was worth a little over $10 per XTZ token but lost over 95% of its value throughout the dire so-called crypto winter of 2018-2019. "

The bill has the potential to solve a major issue with payments made via Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other major cryptocurrency networks in that an exception would be created for the potential capital gains taxes that often occur when these digital assets are used in everyday commerce.The bill was introduced with bipartisan support from U.S. House Representatives DelBene, Schweikert, Soto, and Emmer. Coin Center, which is a group that advocates for regulatory policy on behalf of the cryptocurrency industry, has been working on this tax-related issue with Bitcoin payments since at least 2017.Notably, 2019 saw a number of different members of Congress comment on Bitcoin. With Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA) claiming the crypto asset is a threat to the U.S. dollar and Congressman Patrick McHenry (R-NC) sharing his own bullish comments on the long term utility of Bitcoin.A key usability issue with Bitcoin payments is that taxes may need to be paid in a situation where a capital gain has occurred, which could be when someone is simply buying a meal with Bitcoin at a local restaurant. Under current U.S. law, the use of Bitcoin to pay for goods or services is treated as a sale of those Bitcoin holdings, which is a taxable event.In addition to dealing with the wild price fluctuations found in the cryptocurrency space, users must also track the gains made every time they want to use Bitcoin or another crypto asset as a medium of exchange — at least if they plan on paying the proper amount of taxes.While a previous version of this bill was focused on implementing a tax exemption for transactions in the amount of $600 or less, a different approach has been taken with the 2020 version of the bill. In the Virtual Currency Tax Fairness Act of 2020, capital gains taxes are only exempt in situations where the gains made by an individual as a result of the transaction would be $200 or less.This is somewhat similar to exemptions that already exist for foreign currencies, so cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are at a huge disadvantage when it comes to their potential use in daily commerce. That said, moves by governments to issue their own digital currencies this decade could be extremely helpful to Bitcoin’s value proposition.If passed, the tax exemption would be instated for the 2020 fiscal year.While the vast majority of Bitcoin users are focused on the speculation and store of value use cases, this sort of legislation could be massively helpful in a situation where more people want to start using the digital currency for smaller payments, especially as the Lightning Network continues to develop as a second layer protocol layer for fast, cheap Bitcoin transactions.The progress of this bill should be tracked closely by anyone holding crypto assets, along with the five other major Bitcoin trends to watch in 2020.In other Bitcoin regulatory news, one analyst recently said there is a 60% chance of a Bitcoin ETF approval happening in 2020. More financial advisors are expected to add Bitcoin to their clients’ portfolios in 2020 (according to a survey from last week), and this increased acceptance of the digital asset in the financial industry combined with the upcoming halving event are two key parts of one industry executive’s bull case for Bitcoin in 2020."

Wright claims the trust is currently inaccessible because several keys are held by an unnamed intermediary but now has until February 3 to find them.However, U.S. judge Beth Bloom has expressed doubts that the documents will eventually appear.""Given the defendant’s many inconsistencies and misstatements, the court questions whether it is remotely plausible that the mysterious ‘bonded courier’ is going to arrive, yet alone that he will arrive in January 2020 as the defendant now contends,"" judge Bloom wrote in a court order dated January 10.

Although people typically first hear about Bitcoin, that's just the tip of the iceberg, and most activity is happening elsewhere.Companies from Walmart to Goldman Sachs to Maersk are all working on blockchain, but most are using blockchains like Ethereum and Quorum (which is based on Ethereum). No matter where you stand, there's no denying the fact that blockchain is an important part of the global financial fabric. One good example is Calastone, which processes £180 billion approximately $235 billion) of value every month using a blockchain-based infrastructure.Going from zero transactions on the blockchain just over a decade ago, to now hundreds of thousands a day on the Bitcoin network alone is surely a noteworthy accomplishment. However, Bitcoin is to blockchain as the original iPhone is to smartphones.Bitcoin's status as the first successful cryptocurrency gives it a spot in the history books, but it's just the start of something much bigger. After all, outlets from Bloomberg to TechCrunch to The Guardian laughed at the original iPhone, calling it irrelevant, a ""bauble"" and ""rushed."" Few people expected the iPhone to change communication forever.But it's not like everyone today is using the original iPhone. We're using iterations, improvements and upgrades. Whether it's the iPhone 11, the Samsung Galaxy S10 or the OnePlus 7, we're not using the first iteration of the technology.We're not all driving around with a Ford Model T or playing video games on an Atari. We shouldn't expect everyone to be using Bitcoin as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system when faster, cheaper and more usable alternatives have come around.Predicting the future of technology is tricky, if not impossible. After all, Sony stunned car manufacturers with a futuristic electrical car at CES, and Elon Musk beat all odds by receiving 250,000 pre-orders for the Cybertruck within days of its announcement. And Samsung made waves after releasing a crypto-friendly phone. No one knows for certain what direction technology — whether it's cars, smartphones or the blockchain — will go.But some things are for certain: Technology is constantly evolving, and better technologies always win out in the end. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the cryptocurrency space, where massive price fluctuations, ""rapid"" adoption and wild claims are the norm.There's also a clear evolution, at least among corporations, toward other blockchains like Ethereum. From Amazon to JP Morgan to Microsoft, companies are picking Bitcoin alternatives.As Benjamin Franklin reportedly wrote, ""In this world, nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes.” Well, death is part of evolution, and while Bitcoin may die, other cryptocurrencies will evolve and take its place. Time will tell who will win among Bitcoin Cash, Ether, Ripple or any of thousands of other cryptocurrencies, but the takeaway is this: As one door closes, another opens."

Prices as of 4:00 p.m. on January 10, 2020.Last month, audit and consulting giant Ernst & Young announced the release of its new blockchain technology to the public. It’s part of the firm’s effort to get public networks ready for enterprise blockchain adoption, and the new release is another step in its advocacy of public blockchain network infrastructure as opposed to permissioned and private networks.EY blockchain lead Paul Brody makes a persuasive argument as to why the firm is attempting to fix the shortcomings in public networks as opposed to getting behind private networks as its peers such as IBM and Accenture have done, pointing to the challenge of adoption and on-boarding associated with private networks. Put simply, it’s hard to get organizations to join them.The blockchain and crypto community is ringing in the new year to a level of legislative and regulatory attention that would have been hard to predict a year ago.Since this time last year, Facebook launched the Libra project, Fidelity Investments announced a series of new crypto initiatives and the U.S. Federal Reserve Board revealed that it is working on a crypto-like project known as “central bank digital currency.” More than 200 new crypto projects were launched by technologists both in the U.S. and abroad. And the price of bitcoin rose 300% off its floor before settling in at an average price that is still more than double the late-2018 low. The lesson?

[+] Chesnot/Getty Images)","Bitcoin has experienced some compelling gains this year, climbing more than 20% in the last few weeks. The digital currency reached $8,897.64 this morning, up 23.8% from its price of $7,188.30 at the beginning of 2020, CoinDesk figures show. Some market observers have cited hopes the cryptocurrency will enjoy greater adoption in 2020 when explaining these gains. Others have pointed to anticipation surrounding the upcoming halving, scheduled to take place in May, as helping bitcoin push higher. [Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.]While these are certainly plausible explanations, there are other factors that may have been overlooked. Bitcoin Was OversoldThe digital currency was undervalued when the New Year began, claimed certain analysts. “The price just got too low at the end of last year,” said Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer of asset manager Arca. This development “resulted in a lack of selling coupled with ‘value’ buyers.”“From cost of production, to stock-to-flow, to MVRV and NVT, all fundamental metrics pointed towards value,” he stated. “Those numbers do tell a story of value,” said Marouane Garcon, managing director of crypto-to-crypto derivatives platform Amulet. Tim Enneking, managing director of Digital Capital Management, also weighed in. “The minimum value at which miners can operate also plays a role because ‘value buyers’ will only come in when they think they can buy at the bottom,” he stated. “Therefore, the more important piece of the equation is that $6k appeared to be a bottom because miners would simply stop adding to supply below that level,” said Enneking. Bitcoin’s Safe-Haven AppealAnother factor that analysts spoke to was bitcoin’s draw as a safe haven or hedge against macroeconomic turmoil. Several market observers cited the conflict in Iran as a factor causing investors to flock to the world’s most prominent digital currency. “The Iran/US conflict jolted Bitcoin, as it behaved exactly as you'd expect for a ‘safe-haven’ asset to perform... rallying on both air strikes, while selling off on Trump's de-escalation of further events,” said Dorman. “This gave investors confidence that Bitcoin can be a global macro hedge.” Evan Kuo, CEO and cofounder of digital currency firm Ampleforth, also weighed in. “My sense is in the past year, the narrative that Bitcoin benefits from global instability has started to take hold,” he stated. “With 2020 being an election year (among other things) people are anticipating a lot of uncertainty,” claimed Kuo. A Perfect StormAs soon as bitcoin prices started pushing higher, a multitude of factors helped amplify its gains, said analysts. “The start of a new year always lends some optimism and then the ‘crisis’ between the US and Iran provided a trigger,” said Enneking. “CME futures added momentum to that move and the prospect of the halving creates a bit of FOMO,” he noted. Dorman offered a similar perspective, stating that:“Once the market started to gain momentum, the usual suspects began levering up again, pushing the market even higher. In the past few days, we've seen a large increase in call buying, and futures buying.” Market Outlook“There are literally a hundred reasons to be bullish on crypto at the moment,” said Mati Greenspan, founder of Quantum Economics. “One aspect that I've been watching particularly is the affect of central bank action on the markets,” he clarified. “In the second half of 2019 all of the largest central banks very suddenly changed their policy to ultra accommodative,” said Greenspan. “The affects on the stock market are glaring and many tech companies are seeing their valuations soar. It did take a few months but it seems the funds are starting to trickle through the system into the crypto market as well.” Kuo spoke to other positive developments, stating that “there's no doubt the proliferation of PlanB's stock-to-flow analysis and Bitcoin's 2020 halving have people excited.”“Miners, who have to speculate ahead of retail investors have increased hash rates, further adding to this signal,” he noted. Enneking also weighed in, providing his outlook for the market. He emphasized that the January rally was “much more measured” than the sharp gain that bitcoin experienced in October, when it surged roughly 40% in a single day. “We’ve seen a succession of higher lows (which we haven’t seen since BTC hit almost $14k in the middle of last year), sharp moves up have been tempered and accompanied by a bit of consolidation (witness the last couple of days) and the trendline is much more sustainable over the long term,” he stated.  “Knowing BTC, we will, of course, see major moves up (and down), but the foundation is being put in as we speak for upward moves to continue after some consolidation – as opposed to the 110% retracement we saw after the gravity-defying, late October 2019 spike.”Disclosure: I own some bitcoin, bitcoin cash, litecoin, ether and EOS."

[+] Guesthouse on March 23, 2019 in Beijing, China.","Billionaire investor and Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio was interviewed by CNBC as part of their coverage of the World Economic Forum in Davos on Tuesday morning. During the interview, Dalio painted a picture of the global economy that sounds quite similar to the supporting evidence Bitcoin investors often provide in terms of their bullish scenarios for the cryptocurrency.While his general thesis on what will happen with the economy in the coming years matches up with what many Bitcoin holders think, Dalio’s advice for those worried about tough economic times ahead is to turn to gold, rather than Bitcoin, as a safe haven asset.According to Dalio, the global economy is facing a serious issue in that an economic downturn would be an especially problematic situation for central bankers due to the lack of tools that are available to use, with interest rates already at or near historical lows in many places around the world.“We’re in a spot in monetary policy where you can no longer stimulate the same way you did before,” said Dalio.Additionally, Dalio sees larger budget deficits on the way. In his view, newly-printed money will be used to pay for this increased spending. Dalio added that this scenario does not necessarily mean there will be an acceleration of inflation, as the new money could be funneled into financial assets.“The way it works is: They print money, they buy a bond, they give it to the seller of the bond, and they buy other financial assets,” said Dalio.However, Dalio stated that the attractiveness of government bonds to investors could decline in the coming years, creating new questions regarding what works best as a store of value.“When you get negative-yielding bonds or something, you’re approaching a limit,” said Dalio. “We are approaching a limit that will be a paradigm shift, I think.”In terms of the possibility of an economic downturn during the next U.S. Presidential term, Dalio claimed, “It’s going to happen.”When this economic downturn occurs, Dalio is of the belief that turning to cash won’t be the best option.“You can’t jump into cash,” said Dalio. “Cash is trash . . . because they’re going to print money.”This same sentiment is behind many of the bullish Bitcoin price scenarios that have been espoused over the past couple of years.While Dalio agrees with Bitcoin proponents in terms of the potential issues with holding cash in the near future, the billionaire investor disagrees that the cryptocurrency would be a proper alternative as a store of value.In Dalio’s view, a global portfolio with a certain amount of money put into gold as an additional diversifier will be the best option for investors to deal with the economic downturn that he foresees happening in the coming years.“If you want to oversimplify a portfolio, you probably want stock in the technology, disrupting companies and some gold,” said Dalio.When asked if Bitcoin should also be included in this portfolio, Dalio said no.“There are two purposes of money: a medium of exchange and a store-hold of wealth,” explained Dalio. “And Bitcoin is not effective in either of those cases now.”In Dalio’s view, Bitcoin is simply too volatile to act as a proper store of value, and over the long term, he sees more potential in something like Facebook’s Libra project. That said, there is reason to believe the level of centralization found in Libra and various central bank digital currency projects would actually have a positive effect on Bitcoin.“But also: Who is going to do the buying?” added Dalio. “Central bankers and others. What are they going to hold as reserves? What has been tried and true? Are they going to hold digital Bitcoin? They’re going to hold gold. That is a reserve currency, and it’s been a reserve currency for a thousand years.”Despite Dalio’s comments, data from the second half of 2019 appears to show Bitcoin has made progress in terms of becoming viewed as a “digital gold” by market participants. A potential continuation of this trend is one of the five key Bitcoin stories to watch in 2020.That said, while a survey from last week indicated more financial advisors are looking to add Bitcoin and other crypto assets to client portfolios in 2020, this is still a rare point of view among institutional investors. However, an improving regulatory environment around Bitcoin is one of the reasons an analyst has stated there’s a 60% chance for a Bitcoin ETF approval to occur in 2020.Additionally, a variety of factors have already led one industry executive to predict a $50,000 Bitcoin price by the end of the year."

Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.]January has yielded several bouts of upward price action for bitcoin as the asset looks back on an overall positive start to 2020. John Bollinger, financial analyst, trader, author and originator of the Bollinger Bands technical chart indicator, said he sees positive structure on bitcoin’s chart, but its too soon to declare a longer-term bullish trend reversal. “I’m very constructive on bitcoin’s price right now,” Bollinger told me in an interview on January 27, 2020 while bitcoin’s held near $8,800. “We’ve completed a meaningful bottom formation,” he added referring to bitcoin’s price chart. “We broke out, pulled back from very short term, made a little test of the breakout level and rallied higher,” Bollinger continued. Bitcoin then proceeded to fall back to the midline of the Bollinger Band indicator before bouncing and heading higher in price, he added. After starting 2019 below the $4,000 mark, bitcoin experienced an exuberant price run between April and June 2019, taking the asset up past $13,800 per coin by June’s end, according to Coinbase’s BTC chart on TradingView.com Bitcoin’s price fell on difficult times in the latter half of 2019, however, posting successive lower rally attempts until the end of the year, signaling the presence of a downward bearish price trend. In contrast, 2020 so far has yielded positive price action for crypto’s pioneer asset. Bitcoin began the year around the $7,000 mark, posting a seeming bottom-like price formation, as Bollinger mentioned. The asset has since rallied in price from its chart bottom near $7,000. Most recently, bitcoin rose from approximately $7,700 to almost $9,200 on January 19. The coin then fell down to $8,250 by January 24, finding support in that region before rallying to a press time price of $9,265.“It’s a pretty constructive pattern,” Bollinger said, adding to his initial comments. The expert noted bitcoin formed its price chart base pattern between November 2019 and early January 2020. “So far we’re progressing pretty well,” he said. Bollinger pointed to a tweet he posted on January 23 which expressed that bitcoin’s pullback to the middle Bollinger Band near $8,300 made sense as a support level. “I pointed out on Twitter a couple days ago that what bitcoin needed to do was hold support here at the middle Bollinger Band, and that’s exactly what its done,” Bollinger told me. “It held support. We’ve had two days of rally now and I think the price of bitcoin looks higher.Bitcoin’s recent rally begs the question — has crypto’s top asset broken its downtrend that began last summer? “I think it’s a little bit early to be convinced of that,” Bollinger said. “We just made an intermediate term bottom and just started up — we need some more evidence here in terms of a bigger picture, but I think the outlook is pretty constructive right now.”Crypto trader and Brave New Coin analyst Josh Olszewicz (CarpeNoctom on Twitter) expressed similar sentiment on January 28. “We’ll know how bullish we are in two weeks,” Olszewicz told me in a Telegram message. Mentioning multiple charting signals, including the Ichimoku Cloud and a moving average golden cross, the trader added, “All trend metrics point bullish soon.” Additionally, Olszewicz said his statement applies to the entire crypto market. “This is across the board on everything, not just BTC,” he noted. Despite bitcoin’s exuberant history and optimistic charts, some folks still remain bearish on the asset as a whole, including Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett, who called bitcoin a “gambling device” in 2019, according to a CNBC report.Disclaimer: I actively trade cryptocurrencies, as well as hold a small amount of BTC, ETH, LTC, XMR, NEO, ZEC, BEAM, BCH, DASH, LINK, XTZ and various insignificant other altcoin positions."

[+] Joles","I have maintained for a long time now that China is a very significant driver of bitcoin (BTC). I have also maintained that bitcoin is a leading indicator of troubles in China because it is a “safe haven asset” and “flight capital.”I have repeated the assertion that you can’t easily fly out of a country with cash or gold and for countries with capital controls BTC is the only way to get out of town with significant amounts of capital.Like it or not, the “people” are never the first to know when trouble is brewing. That is the whole reason “insider information” is illegal to act upon. The first to know in these emergency situations are the first to act.So if you were a rich Chinese person and you heard about this outbreak, what would you do? You would certainly consider packing the family off for a bit of a holiday. You might stick around to look after the business, but you would definitely get your loved ones out. You see this in the Riviera. The Russian oligarchs keep their families safe in France while they ply their trade in Moscow. Who would not do the same in that situation?However, you have to fund a long stay abroad and the best way to go, unless you are very well prepared, is to grab some bitcoin because once you have those crypto wallet keys the money is anywhere you want it. You might also buy it as a hedge against the worst.The coronavirus outbreaks started in early December, so let’s take a look at bitcoin:Bitcoin's movement since the Coronavirus outbreak in DecwemberRemember we are not looking to the future, we are looking to the past, a past where things are happening before we know about them. Bitcoin’s recent rally aligns with the assumption that Chinese demand for bitcoin because of coronavirus has driven the price.However, what are we looking for? We are looking for an early signal that things are going to blow over or get worse and I believe you can look at bitcoin for that “temperature.” As such, the chart suggests the situation is stabilizing, but of course it cannot predict the future, only the current situation.This is what we are looking for in the Bitcoin chartWith the media screaming “plague” at the top of its toxic voice, the stock market could well take a tumble, but unless BTC shoots above $10,000 and heads for the moon I will be holding and looking to buy. I wrote a fiction novel about global plague called The First Horseman so I’m pre-sensitized to think the worse, but people on the ground will know what is really going on and will react like rational economic actors; if they think the game is up the word will spread far faster than the infection and BTC is the instrument that will react sharply and send up the “‘SELL” flare and have me pulling up my drawbridge.I think we are going to get a buying opportunity in the market, not a global catastrophe, but that’s simply a barely informed guess. Instead I believe bitcoin will provide early warning of good or bad news and we will have a reasonably clear picture one way or the other within ten days.As such, I’m going to be watching the bitcoin price like a hawk.From Forbes: Stay informed and ahead of the crowd with Forbes Crypto Confidential, a free weekly e-letter delivered to your inbox.

For years, I've been hearing stories about this all-digital monetary system helping early adopters strike it rich. Or, how crypto will soon disrupt our well-established financial structures.","Still, interesting as it all sounded, I couldn't say I fully understood it.That's why I was thrilled to sit down with tech entrepreneur and cryptocurrency expert Deana Burke. Deana BurkeDeana is the founder of Gracias, a startup with a mission to share Bitcoin with young women, teens, and people from diverse backgrounds. She's also incredible at explaining complex concepts like cryptocurrency to even the least tech-savvy people (like me!) After all, Deana herself struggled with the concept of cryptocurrency at first. However, something about this new way of exchanging goods and making money intrigued her. Before she knew it, Deana had bought in. But Deana does more than explain Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. She's determined to show how it could change the lives of those previously left out of the wealth conversation altogether.The Bitcoin BasicsI couldn't wait to chat with Deana so I could finally grasp the basics behind Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. Here's just a little bit of what I learned:What is Cryptocurrency?Cryptocurrency is a form of currency used to exchange goods online using digital coins or tokens. Bitcoin might be the most recognizable form of cryptocurrency, but it's far from the only one. Thousands exist and are traded daily. Other popular types of cryptocurrency include Ethereum, Monero, and Ripple. As for why Deana prefers Bitcoin to its competitors? ""There's a purity in its formation,"" she says. ""Like the lack of a founder figure. It's truly powered by the network and by a community of developers."" She also admits that name recognition helps, especially since she has a message and mission to get out there.What is Bitcoin?Bitcoin was created in 2008 by someone known as Satoshi Nakamoto. To this date, nobody knows who Nakamoto is, if it's even one person—or if they ever existed in the first place. ""Very mysterious circumstances surround the invention of Bitcoin,"" says Deana, and she admits that this adds to the system's allure.Essentially, Nakamoto created Bitcoin as open-source software, which means anyone can have full access. ""There's no Bitcoin as a company,"" she says. ""It's completely decentralized. It’s powered by a community of people who are passionate about it, and who see it as a way to make money for themselves.""It's a currency that offers an even playing field.What is Bitcoin Mining?In a sense, Bitcoin mining is similar to printing traditional currency. However, since Bitcoin is entirely digital, this process is as well. Honestly, the mining process isn't the easiest to explain (think solving complex equations only solvable by high-powered computers). Even Deana admits to nearly dismissing Bitcoin altogether when she first heard about the concept of mining.  But we don't need to know how a dollar is made use it. The same goes for Bitcoin. If you'd like to know more though, here is a great article from Investopedia.How Many Bitcoin Are There?Unlike traditional currency systems, only 21 million Bitcoin will ever exist. To date, about 18 million have been mined. Once the 21 million Bitcoin cap is hit, no more will be created. This resolves many issues, especially those related to inflation. ""It's what's called a deflationary currency,"" Deana explains. ""The United States can just keep printing dollars willy nilly for all sorts of reasons. With Bitcoin...there will only ever be 21 million. ""That's one of the beautiful things about it. And that's a big reason why people predict that the value will continue to rise in the future."" New Bitcoins are unlocked at set intervals, so at some point, they all will have been released. ""At that point, it becomes something that looks a lot more like a gold asset with appreciating value.""How Much Is a Bitcoin Worth?When first created in 2008, Bitcoin was worthless. Like any other good or currency, an agreed-upon value needs to be established. Over a decade later, Bitcoin has emerged as the leading form of cryptocurrency, and that value has skyrocketed. At the time of publication, a single Bitcoin was worth about USD 8,600—though that price regularly fluctuates.So, if you didn't buy into Bitcoin at the beginning and can't afford the four-figure price tag, does that mean you're priced out?Absolutely not! ""You can buy fractions of a Bitcoin,"" Deana says. ""You can buy five dollars worth of Bitcoin... It's divisible up to fractions of a penny. ""In fact, it's divisible even more than dollars. That's one thing that makes it really interesting for micro-transactions. People are doing interesting things around tiny fragments of Bitcoin.""What Is Bitcoin Used For?Today, you can use Bitcoin with many brands and online stores, including Microsoft, Etsy, and Expedia. It also makes international money transfers faster, easier and more affordable. For example, if you wanted to send money overseas via a wire transfer, just think of all the hands that it'll ""touch"" on the way. Each of those hands will slow down the process and usually tack on a fee.""Everyone is grabbing a piece of the pie,"" says Deana. ""One of the beautiful things about Bitcoin is that you could send money to India right now. It would take twenty minutes and be at a fraction of the cost of wire transfer. It disrupts the entire banking system.""This all just scratches the surface of cryptocurrency. But now that we have a better understanding of what it all means, let's learn why Deana believes Bitcoin could restructure the face of the marketplace.Will Bitcoin Change Finance Forever?Deana's no doubt a fantastic instructor. However, her passion for Bitcoin goes far past just teaching others about the digital currency. She also believes that it can change the world—especially for those often left behind by traditional financial systems like women, young people, and those not born into money.So, how could cryptocurrency open the market up to everyone?For Deana, it's all about increased accessibility. ""The only thing keeping people from being able to access it is information and knowledge,"" she says. ""It represents a level playing field for people who don't necessarily come from generational wealth."" In essence, the newness of the system eliminates many of the barriers that have previously kept most people out of making it rich. ""The number one indicator of having money and being wealthy is being born with money,"" says Deana. ""One thing that I love about Bitcoin is that it doesn't have the same sort of history. It has no gatekeepers. Anyone could jump into Bitcoin today and make of it what they want.""It was this realization that impassioned Deana to launch Gracias as a platform to introduce people to cryptocurrency. ""If it's going to be this new economy in ten years, then knowing a little bit about it today could mean a world of difference to someone tomorrow. ""That's my personal mission. It's what gets me out of bed every morning.""Listen to my entire conversation with Deana Burke on the donothing podcast. You'll learn more about Bitcoin, why she became so involved with the cryptocurrency world, how she successfully built-up and sold her past companies, and so much more.  Also, I’d love to connect with you on Twitter and LinkedIn, as well as have you keep up with my company imageOne.

[+] tokens, including chainlink, are making huge gains.The chainlink price reached its highest in late June of 2019, hitting $4.55 and up over 1800% from the start of 2019.The massive rally was caused by interest in chainlink from China, the world's largest bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchange by volume, Binance, working with chainlink developers so-called decentralized finance products, and search giant Google using chainlink's blockchain to bridge legacy databases.""As with most blockchain projects in their infancy given the low liquidity initially, any surge in demand is likely to cause significant impact on price,"" said Simon Peters, bitcoin and crypto analyst at investment platform eToro. The chainlink price has fallen back somewhat from its all-time high but has broken the broader cryptocurrency downward trend—with almost all so-called altcoins failing to recover after the brutal crypto winter of late 2018 and early 2019. The chainlink price hits an all-time high of $4.54 back in July of last year and has since fallen ... [+] back from there but remains significantly up on the start of 2019. ""With chainlink developers working with the likes of Swift to help connect banks to smart contracts, as well as major companies like Google, naturally this has caused excitement around the potential of the platform going forward,"" Peters added. ""This has subsequently encouraged investors to buy the link token, speculating on the project's future success. With link prices increasing over the last year, this was further compounded by the 'fear of missing out' phenomenon."""

The prospect of a Bitcoin ETF has been tracked closely by cryptocurrency enthusiasts for a number of years now, mainly due to the potential impact such a product could have on the Bitcoin price.ETF or not, industry executives have already predicted that the Bitcoin price could reach $20,000 or $50,000 by the end of 2020. Additionally, the crypto asset took a major step forward in 2019 in terms of living up to its key use case.During his appearance on CNBC, Lydon mentioned a few recent developments that could indicate a Bitcoin ETF will happen in 2020.For one, the SEC recently approved its first ‘40 Act-approved Bitcoin fund in the form of the NYDIG Bitcoin Strategy Fund.“What it [does] is basically approve that it’s filed as publicly traded, so you can, like a regular mutual fund, like the Magellan Fund, there’s a sister mutual fund out there where you can invest in Bitcoin,” explained Lydon. “However, it’s limited to only $25 million at this point.”Lydon also pointed out that the CME began offering Bitcoin options for the first time on Monday. The ETF Trends CEO claimed the SEC’s concerns regarding a lack of liquidity and safety around the Bitcoin asset could be mitigated through the use of options and futures.“The more we can get on account statements like your Schwab account, like your TD [Ameritrade] account — that’s going to help things out,” Lydon added.Lydon shared his view that there’s a 60% chance of a Bitcoin ETF happening this year when asked to provide a prediction. DataTrek Research co-founder Nick Colas then shared his belief that there is only a 10% chance of a Bitcoin ETF being approved in 2020, and CNBC’s Bob Pisani agreed with Colas’s prediction.“They still haven’t figure out that — remember, you’re not dealing with the CFTC here. This is not futures, different people,” argued Pisani. “The SEC is terrified grandma is going to buy a Bitcoin ETF that is going to collapse, and five years later, all the people running the SEC are going to get hauled in front of Congress and get [asked], ‘Are you the guys who approved grandma buying the Bitcoin ETF?’”Lydon countered Pisani’s argument by stating everyone would be better off if Bitcoin trading was included on registered brokerage statements, so the regulators can track everything more easily."

""Having rallied over 12% in three days, [bitcoin] hit a peak of $9,389 overnight, its highest level since early November when it nudged over $9,400. This could prove to be the next significant hurdle of resistance, although if we do see a pullback, seeing the price make another higher low and maintain the 2020 uptrend will be encouraging for bulls.""Bitcoin bulls have been out in force over the last few weeks, with many hoping calendar highlights including May's bitcoin halving and hotly-anticipated upgrades to the bitcoin network could send bitcoin back to its all-time highs this year. The bitcoin price has climbed to year-to-date highs but is still far from its 2019 peak. ""I would conjecture most normal people are unaware of [bitcoin], and when the price starts running, the masses will come in as we’ve seen before,"" Luno Asia head of business Vijay Ayyar told CNBC earlier this month.

[+] east China, Jan. 7, 2020.","On Monday, Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk appeared on the Third Row Tesla Podcast to discuss a variety of topics regarding his past companies, current work, and thoughts on the future of technology. At one point in the conversation, Musk was asked for his thoughts on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, a subject he has been known to tweet about somewhat frequently.“I’m neither here nor there on Bitcoin,” said Musk in terms of his general thoughts on the financial technology.Musk was then asked to share how he felt after he read Satoshi Nakamoto’s Bitcoin white paper for the first time, to which the Tesla CEO responded, “I thought it was pretty clever.”While Musk sees value in Bitcoin as a tool for illegal transactions, he does not appear to be a fan of the “digital gold” thesis around the asset as a store of value.As Musk dove deeper into his general thoughts and feelings on Bitcoin, his general thesis on crypto became much clearer.“This sort of gets the crypto people angry, but there are transactions that are not within the balance of the law,” said Musk. “And there are, obviously, many laws in different countries. And, normally, cash is used for these transactions. But, in order for illegal transactions to occur, cash must also be used for legal transactions. You need an illegal to legal bridge. That’s where crypto comes in.”When asked if he was specifically referring to dark web activities, Musk responded, “It can’t be entirely dark because, otherwise, how do you buy normal stuff? And cash, these days, is used much rarer. It’s increasingly difficult to use cash. Some places, you can’t use cash at all. So, there’s a forcing function for transactions that are illegal, quasi-legal, and in some cases legal. But it’s got to have both legal and illegal.”While Musk sees value in Bitcoin as a tool for payments that may not otherwise be allowed to occur, the Tesla CEO also sees a need for a bridge to exist between a crypto-driven black market and the legal economy.Notably, a bill was introduced in Congress last week that could have a massive impact on the ability for Bitcoin to act as a legal, functional currency in the United States.Although Musk sees utility in Bitcoin for its ability to enable more illegal transactions in a cashless society, he seemed to throw cold water on the idea that it will become some sort of global reserve currency of the world.“Where I see crypto as is effectively a replacement for cash,” said Musk. “But not as a replacement for a primary — I do not see crypto being the primary database.”Billionaire investor Ray Dalio also warned against the potential for Bitcoin to become a store of value (similar to gold) during an interview with CNBC earlier this week. That said, data from the second half of 2019 appears to indicate a growing view of Bitcoin as “digital gold” among market participants. This will be one of the key trends to watch for Bitcoin in 2020.The expectation that more institutional investors will come into the market as Bitcoin heads into its third halving event is behind a variety of bullish predictions for the crypto asset in 2020. One industry executive has even predicted the Bitcoin price will reach $50,000 before the end of the year.In his final comment on the topic of Bitcoin, Musk clarified that he does not have some sort of moral objection to crypto.“This is sometimes taken as being like I’m being judgmental about crypto, but it’s actually — there are a lot of things that are illegal that shouldn’t be illegal,” explained Musk. “I think sometimes governments have too many laws. They shouldn’t have so many things that are illegal.”It should be noted that Musk has been rather consistent with his views on Bitcoin over the years, as he shared similar thoughts on the topic as far back as 2014."

China, in particular, has been drawing substantial attention, as many have been eagerly awaiting the digital yuan it plans to issue. The relative malaise experienced by bitcoin markets took place as the cryptocurrency struggled with lackluster sentiment, said analysts. [Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.]In December, the digital currency’s average monthly volatility reached its lowest since March, according to data provided by independent cryptocurrency analyst David Martin.Further, “bitcoin’s average volatility for the month of December (48%) was significantly below the yearly average of 65%,” he added. The chart below helps show this volatility: This shows bitcoin's 30-day volatility (by month) for 2019. The digital currency also experienced lackluster trading volume, a development emphasized by Mati Greenspan, founder of the newsletter Quantum Economics. “Throughout the month, bitcoin traded in a very tight range and on low volume. It did threaten to dip lower several times but managed to hold ground, possibly indicating that a bottom is in sight.”Bitcoin Trading Largely Range-BoundAmid these market factors, the cryptocurrency spent most of December fluctuating between $7,000 and $8,000, CoinDesk data shows. Bitcoin experienced some notable price volatility early in the month, surging to an intra-month high of nearly $7,800 on December 4th, additional CoinDesk figures reveal. Roughly two weeks later, on December 18th, the digital currency fell to nearly $6,400, its lowest point of the month. The cryptocurrency quickly recovered, a development that took place when bitcoin experienced strong support, said Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer of asset manager Arca. Bitcoin prices rallied largely because buyers drew a ""line in the sand,” he stated. “The general consensus was that the market would go lower near-term, but move substantially higher longer-term (as seen throughout December in the options curve with positive 1-month skew but very negative 3- and 6-month skew, and much higher volatility in the longer-dated options),” added Dorman. “This positioning meant that it was pretty easy for the market to move higher once real-money buying stepped in.”After experiencing this rebound close to mid-month, the digital currency spent most of December’s remainder moving between $7,000 and $7,500. Central Banks Steal The SpotlightCentral banks around the world have been drawing the interest of investors, traders and cryptocurrency enthusiasts who want to see the progress these financial institutions are making toward issuing fiat digital currencies. The People’s Bank of China (PBOC), in particular, has been generating visibility as industry participants wait for it to issue its fiat digital currency, called digital currency electronic payment (DCEP). Last month, reports surfaced indicating that the PBOC planned to test out DCEP by holding pilots in cities including Suzhou and Shenzhen. The idea was to hold trials using the digital fiat currency for real-world applications, according to CoinDesk. China is not alone in working towards the use of CBDC, as many central banks have been working toward releasing such digital assets. CBDCs have taken center stage, as a decision by a major economy to implement a fiat digital currency would be a major endorsement for the entire crypto space. Further, such a move could provide significant improvements for our financial system. “CBDCs are a reaction to the rise of cryptocurrencies and the realisation by central banks that existing payment rails for fiat currencies are slow, inefficient and technologically outdated, and that the private sector alone may not be able to fix this,” said Nic Niedermowwe, cofounder & CEO of Prime Factor Capital. “In addition, some countries such as China may see CBDC as an opportunity to spread the use of their currency beyond national borders in order to gain political and economic influence,” he stated. “An example would be the ability to sanction other countries by cutting them off from access to a payment system they have come to rely on, or conversely by offering them an alternative access to the international financial system.” Lackluster SentimentThe sentiment of bitcoin traders was relatively mild in December, according to data provided by digital analytics platform TheTIE.io. During the month, the cryptocurrency’s 30-day average daily sentiment score changed little, starting the month out with a value slightly below 50 (average) and finishing the period at roughly 51. This chart depicts bitcoin’s price movements and sentiment in December:Bitcoin price versus its 30-day average daily sentiment. While the figures supplied by TheTIE.io made sentiment appear lukewarm, Dorman took a different tack. He maintained that “negative sentiment in Asia” has been “weighing on Bitcoin” during the month, as “we’ve seen a lot more selling pressure during Asian hours than US hours.” As central banks around the world make progress toward rolling out digital fiat currencies and the broader digital currency space continues to evolve, sentiment could very well improve, helping place upward pressure on asset prices.

question ...","Feb 7, 2020,11:06am EST",Getty Images,"Bitcoin’s chart is at a crucial area. Stuck between lower highs since 2017 but higher lowers in its long-term trend, and the heralded “havening” around the corner, bitcoin speculators expect King Crypto to be on the verge of a monster move higher. But if bitcoin serves the purpose that true believers think it will, the next big move is likely to be lower. The most important debate around crypto is whether investors should think of bitcoin as a “safe haven” asset like gold and bonds. It’s the question that matters most to true believers, who see bitcoin as the solution to global central banks undermining fiat currencies. But at least in the short-term, evidence from the global economy suggests central banks will be able to stay out of the picture. If bitcoin really is a safe haven, then it should resume its trend lower. There’s no perfect box in which to put bitcoin, but bitcoin’s overall trend the last 12 months – higher during spring and summer of 2019, lower highs until December – does to a large degree match the trajectory of bonds and gold. And it makes a good bit of sense, if you accept that bitcoin trades on belief that it could be a potential store of value in a world awash with cheap money.  More specifically, bitcoin is best thought of as a *subset* of traditional safe-haven assets. Because bitcoin is viewed by enough of its investor base as a way to bet on excessive central bank activity that will one day undermine the value of fiat currencies, it moves in relation to expectations of central bank activity. It’s rallied when the economic outlook looks rough, because right now, the market equates uncertainty to central bank activity. Fed cuts also support bond bulls and gold bulls. This is why bitcoin has been trending lower since the summer of last year as a U.S.-China trade deal came to fruition, the Fed was able to pause its cut cycle, and the global economy turned toward stability. Bonds and gold followed, but bitcoin had the most pronounced move, because it has the most riding on central bank cuts. If negative interest rates peaked last year, economies stabilize, and the existing financial system is not broken enough to demand a solution to fiat money, bitcoin’s use-case falters. It doesn’t have the same track record as gold, and bonds attract buyers for all kinds of reasons. Bitcoin has the most to prove, the biggest hype to live up to, and will swing the most as those interest-rate expectations change. One could loosely describe it as a “high-beta” haven trade, assuming the solution to economic risk means interest rate cuts. And so as coronavirus sent the odds of another Fed cut soaring this year, bitcoin, bond and gold all rallied. Yet right now it’s looking weary next to its safe-haven peers. Gold broke out to a new 7-year high this year, bonds are the highest since early October, and bitcoin is struggling to break 10,000. Overhead pressure from bubble-buyers and whales likely remains, and U.S. economic data is crushing expectations. If this continues, the odds of a rate-cut will likely revert lower, and the trend lower in bitcoin should, according to this theory, resume downward too.  Or will it? The exception to bitcoin’s trend as a safety asset is of course 2017. The epic bubble in crypto then looked a lot more like the melt-up in risk assets like stocks than anything in bonds or gold. So what do we conclude if it indeed explodes higher? Unclear, but unless it comes with a big deterioration in the economic outlook, it’s probably a sign of gross speculation gone AWOL once more. In that case, it’s best thought of as a risk asset more similar to stocks – and that’s not good for its long-term viability."

hedge my stocks because the sort of shock that would knock the Dow on ...","Jan 15, 2020,02:55pm EST",Photo by Jack Taylor,"As highlighted a few days ago in this article: Altcoins will rocket when bitcoin is strong. A host of altcoins have exploded since I wrote this January 8. As someone that eats my own dog food, you can imagine I’m quite happy.Altcoins have rocketed recently.This event has left lots of people flummoxed, but the answer to why this can happen is “beta.” Beta is a measure of volatility. The more beta there is, the more volatile the price of an instrument will be.Back in the day beta used to be an investment thesis. To get an outperformance on your portfolio you bought “high beta” stocks because they had more ping in them in the market than low beta stocks. So if you thought things were going up, you would buy high beta to get higher returns than you would from a basket of low beta stocks.You can use high beta to hedge too, and I use the high beta of bitcoin to hedge my stocks because the sort of shock that would knock the Dow on its rear is just the sort of news that would sling bitcoin to a lunar orbit.Without doubt, something is up and its reflecting in bitcoin’s strength; you don’t have to be much of a chartist to see that it has broken out. I could have written about this earlier but this kind of breakout is fragile and easy to second guess. Such a chart is simply a very bullish indicator and four times in five such a chart pattern will fail.Bitcoin has broken outHowever, the chart looks great and bitcoin is showing good strength and there is certainly enough geopolitical fuel out there to slingshot the market should things go wrong. I have said before, you will read about what moves bitcoin a few days after it happened and you can imagine not all bad things “people in the know” hedge against, happen, so sometimes you will never know.Meanwhile, you can see this big altcoin rally right down the charts of coins because as the top coin rockets so the small ones follow as the speculators pile into the minnows. Bitcoin drives everything and the moves of the altcoins are reflections of their volatility and their exchange exposure to trading and acquisition.Markets always want to personify moves and so in this case the move in Bitcoin SV (BSV) has come into focus, the idea presumably being that the unlocking of a huge chunk of bitcoin would lead to them being sold and the proceeds invested in bitcoin SV, thus pushing the price of bitcoin SV towards the hugely higher levels of bitcoin. Another idea for the move is that bitcoin SV is about to get a technical upgrade. I’m always skeptical about stories driving markets. Money flows drive markets and few have the kind of money needed to make much of an impact and few that do get to keep it.If bitcoin continues its ascent then the high beta altcoins will outperform on the way up as they will underperform on the way down. These financial instruments are tiny in comparison to other instruments and can move hugely. This knife cuts both ways.My instinct in crypto trading is to flip out of whatever goes vertical into BTC, only to consider returning after the dust has settled. I did this today with Bitcoin Cash (BCH). I’m leaving my other altcoins because one thing equities teach you is its tricky to time the market, so if you are going to try, best stage it.While flipping out of alts into bitcoin after this huge spike may prove clever or stupid, the main message is, bitcoin is strong and altcoins are responding to this strength. Bitcoin’s chart looks great and the chances are that money flow is driving this and that is coming from one of the trouble spots on the globe we could all do with less of. If this continues then the speculators will climb on board and off we will go on another big rally.However, we should remember that the target of bitcoin believers is a number of years off so the key thing is not to trade the market and get left on the beach when, as is almost inevitable, you mistime a trade and get left holding “fiat” as crypto roars away.Get timely investing news and information delivered to your inbox from Forbes Investing Digest.

A 51% attack can be carried out on a cryptocurrency blockchain if a single miner controls more than half of the computing power directed at the network.

But it shouldn't be—stock prices are based on the promise of future investor returns. Bitcoin promises buyers nothing. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has previously praised bitcoin but he is unconvinced it is a sound investment. Last week, the bitcoin-Tesla comparison was made by GLJ Research’s Gordon Johnson, who branded Tesla's stock market surge ""effectively bitcoin on wheels,"" when speaking to Fox Business. ""We think this is a bubble,"" Johnson said. ""We think a lot of people are scared to miss the upside,"" suggesting so-called fear of missing out (FOMO) is driving the Tesla share price higher and pointing to elusive profits and unreliable demand from China.Bitcoin's 2017 bull run, which saw the bitcoin price surge from under $1,000 at the beginning of the year to almost $20,000 by December, was powered by FOMO on a global scale—and resulted in bitcoin's subsequent near-90% crash.Analysis of how both bitcoin and Tesla have performed during in their respective bull runs shows other similarities. The speed of Tesla’s recent rally exceeds bitcoin's at its peak, financial newswire Bloomberg reported yesterday, after it found Tesla's 14-day relative strength index, a gauge of the magnitude and persistence of price movements, topped bitcoin's in December 2017. ""Tesla at its current price is effectively the same as bitcoin at its all-time high in 2017,"" crypto trader Scott Melker said via Twitter, commenting on a bitcoin-Tesla price comparison chart shared by Mike Novogratz, the former billionaire hedge fund manager and chief executive of bitcoin and cryptocurrency investment company Galaxy Digital.These cosmetic comparisons are where the similarities end, however.Last week, Tesla reported earnings beyond Wall Street expectations, posting its second consecutive quarter of profitability and forecasting it should remain profitable. This week, the market was set alight by analysts at Argus Research who raised their price target for Tesla from $556 to $808 and by Tesla cheerleaders at Ark Investment Management who believe the stock could be worth upwards of $7,000 per share by 2024—calls based on market research and potential future returns. ""Despite past production delays, parts shortages, labor cost overruns and other difficulties, we expect Tesla to benefit from its dominant position in the electric vehicle industry and to improve performance in 2020 and beyond,"" Argus Research said in its note on Monday.Many, meanwhile expect bitcoin to make the same kind of rises Argus and Ark have predicted for Tesla—based only the expectation demand for bitcoin will rise. One U.S. wealth manager has recently said he expects the bitcoin price to soar by almost 50-fold over the next ten years, meaning he thinks one bitcoin will be worth a staggering $400,000 by 2030—giving bitcoin a market capitalization of around $8 trillion.However, during this time bitcoin will give the market no updates, will pay no dividends and can promise no profitability—it could, and very well might, be replaced by a superior technology.Buying Tesla stock right now might be like buying bitcoin in December 2017 but the valuations given to even surging stock like Tesla are based on something more solid.

Joe DiPasquale, CEO of cryptocurrency hedge fund manager BitBull Capital, weighed in on this situation. “January was very eventful for Bitcoin and the crypto space and saw a net gain in Bitcoin’s price despite volatility,” he stated. “We can attribute this price action to various developments, starting from the US-Iran tensions in early January to the Coronavirus outbreak near the end,” noted DiPasquale. “Add to these factors catalysts like the upcoming halving and the U.S. Fed leaving interest rates unchanged and it made sense for investors to turn towards BTC.” Bitcoin’s Continued AdoptionKiana Danial, CEO of Invest Diva, also noted other potential price drivers, emphasizing bitcoin’s continued adoption. “We’re seeing Bitcoin ATMs in more locations around the US than ever, including in airports and in shopping malls, so the Bitcoin branding is gaining momentum,” she stated. At the time of this writing, there were roughly 6,700 bitcoin ATMs around the world, according to data from coinatmradar.com. In comparison, fewer than 400 of these devices existed in early 2015. Danial also noted that financial advisors are warming up to the digital currency, stating that they “are slowly but surely allocating small portions of Bitcoin and other crypto-assets to their client’s portfolios.”This view is supported by recent survey data, as a January poll conducted by Bitwise Asset Management and ETF Trends found that the number of financial advisors who put their clients’ money into cryptocurrency is expected to reach 13% this year, more than double last year’s figure of 6%. Technical FactorsWhile several analysts pointed toward fundamental developments as helping drive bitcoin’s price gains, some market observers also cited technical factors. “Regardless of the current social and political climate that has contributed to the flight to safe assets, we also saw a very strong bullish indication beginning of January from a technical point of view,” said Danial. “This was right after the launch of options on Bitcoin futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), which triggered the recent bullish momentum,” she stated. “Bitcoin found support at $6,510 in December and broke above the daily Ichimoku cloud indicator mid-January, confirming the strong bullish signal.”Going forward, bitcoin faces significant resistance at $9,500, said DiPasquale. He noted that “$9,500 is a strong ceiling and we can expect the price action to lose momentum and possibly drop down towards $8,800, followed by $8,500, to affirm newly formed support levels, before it can realistically tackle the $10,000 barrier,” he stated.

""We have also seen many Central Banks looking into the creation of their digital currencies and implementation of blockchain technology in their legacy financial ecosystems,"" he says. Florian Glatz, Co-Founder of Fundament Securities, agrees. ""Benoît Cœuré, head of the Innovation Hub at the Bank for International Settlements recently asserted the benefits of digital currency and strong appetite among central banks and the European Central Banks (ECB) concerning their role in financial intermediation,"" he says. ""2020 will see the People's Bank of China launch its digital yuan, and the debate for digitizing the Euro will become more acute.""He thinks that the warming of central banks to digital currencies and hype and attention to Libra could help Bitcoin break its previous peak, and that it will surpass $20,000.Vaibhav Kadikar, CEO and Founder of CloseCross, isn't that optimistic. He sees digital asset prices stabilizing after the tumultuous 2019, rather than hitting new highs. ""In the new decade, the high volatility of the asset will become a distant memory,"" he says. ""Price stabilization will spur a renewed interest from institutional investors to enter the space.""As for Dave Hodgson, Director, and Co-Founder of NEM Ventures, he is skeptical about the impact of regulation and central banks' engagement with blockchain on cryptocurrency prices.""In 2019, we have seen an increase in governments, regulators and central banks engaging with blockchain and crypto in general - sometimes positively and sometimes not so positively,"" he says. ""Notably, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) recommendations around Know Your Customer (KYC) continues to have an impact on how crypto exchanges operate; the Libra association continues to divide regulators, customers, and the crypto industry, and the launch of the first Security Tokens by both major institutions (Societe Generale) and national markets, such as Germany (BitBond), is making waves.""Meanwhile, he is looking forward to several trends for 2020. Like Bitcoin's ""halving."" ""Previous Bitcoin halving events have grabbed the public's attention and the technical analysis is lining up to make sure this one is no different,"" says Hodgson. And the releasing significant technology upgrades by multiple large chains – Ethereum with ETH2.0 and NEM with Catapult - both in early 2020. ""I believe we will also witness continued innovation in the DeFi space, which is accelerating every quarter now, coupled with increased security token issuance and maturation across the board, and, if the market returns to fundraising, it will be a more well-structured mechanism than last time.""That's certainly a lot of ""ifs"" that could take cryptocurrency markets for another wild ride in 2020."

""We were not removed for being involved with cryptocurrency,"" Daniel Rice, cofounder and chief technology officer at Bling, wrote in a Medium post on Monday February 3rd explaining why Apple chose to boot Bitcoin Blast from the platform, adding the team will try to make the app available on iOS in the future but ""it’s also possible that Bitcoin Blast will never return to an Apple platform.""Google, which controls some of the internet's most widely-used services, could make bitcoin ...

The app has now been reinstated but only after its developers, Bling, made a public plea for help, echoing a similar situation late last year when Google's YouTube banned many of the most popular bitcoin-related creators on the platform only to, mostly, reverse the decision in the wake of the subsequent backlash.Shortly after the YouTube crackdown, Google suspended the popular MetaMask crypto wallet and mobile browser app backed by ethereum incubator ConsenSys from the Play Store, only to eventually reinstate it. The Bitcoin Blast ban caused Bling chief executive Amy Wan to question her company's future relationship with Google and she warned other bitcoin and crypto businesses to avoid doing all their business on Google's platforms.""Google’s suspension cited their 'deceptive behavior' policy ... but did not state exactly what behavior Google thought was deceptive,"" Wan wrote in an opinion piece published on a crypto industry trade site. ""In their last reply, Google stated that they were 'not able to provide any more information or a better answer to your question,'"" Wan said, adding Google eventually allowed Bling to resubmit the app to the Play Store even though she still isn't sure what Google thought was deceptive about the app in the first place.Google has not responded to a request for comment.Some in the bitcoin and cryptocurrency industry have previously threatened to boycott Google over its treatment of bitcoin-related news, services and products, while others have called for an alternative to the internet giant.

is ...","Jan 15, 2020,10:10pm EST",Getty,"A new report (PDF) from Bitwise and ETF Trends has looked into how financial advisors think about Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.Notably, the report indicates that roughly 9% of independent registered investment advisors (RIA) currently allocate a percentage of client funds to crypto assets. According to the report, the rate of crypto investment among independent RIAs is higher than the rates found with financial planners, wirehouse representatives, and broker dealers due to the relative lack of restrictions independent RIAs face in terms of the types of investments they’re able to make on behalf of their clients.While overall allocation among financial advisors is still low at around 6%, the report indicates a potential doubling or more for this sort of activity in 2020 based on survey responses.A variety of reasons for potentially adding Bitcoin exposure to client portfolios are provided in the survey, but the fact that the cryptocurrency is largely uncorrelated with other asset classes is the most highly-cited factor for financial advisors.According to the report from Bitwise and ETF Trends, 54% of financial advisors view Bitcoin’s lack of correlation to other asset classes as a reason to add the crypto asset (or one of its competitors) to client portfolios.“That finding aligns with Bitwise’s qualitative view of how the primary narrative surrounding the investment aspects of crypto evolved in 2019,” the report adds. “From our perspective, 2019 saw a significant uptick amongst both the mainstream media and traditional Wall Street analysts in discussing crypto as a ‘safe haven asset’ and a new form of ‘digital gold.’ That messaging appears to have resonated with the financial advisor community.”To Bitwise’s point, data from the second half of 2019 appears to show that Bitcoin’s role as a digital gold is going from theory to reality. Additionally, one industry executive pointed to this increasing view of Bitcoin as a digital gold when making a $50,000 Bitcoin price prediction for 2020.That said, only 9% of financial advisors surveyed in the report view “inflation hedging” as a reason to add crypto assets to a portfolio. The report states that part of the reason for this seemingly low positive response rate could be due to a lack of concern regarding inflation today.Notably, the percentage of financial advisors who said they would choose commodities as the area from which to pull capital for a potential crypto asset investment doubled from the 2019 version of the same survey, which could be viewed as another indication of growing sentiment around Bitcoin as a digital gold.In addition to the potential for returns uncorrelated with other assets, 30% of financial advisors said the high potential returns found in the crypto market made exposure to this asset class attractive for client portfolios. Additionally, 26% of financial advisors view client demand as a reason for Bitcoin’s attractiveness, with another 23% enjoying the fact that it’s simply something new to offer their clients.Of course, there are still a number of issues with allocating client funds to the crypto market, which is why the vast majority of financial advisors still do not feel comfortable with this proposition.In terms of specific road blocks in making a crypto asset investment with client funds, financial advisors included in the survey pointed to these issues:According to the report, the high degree of concern around regulation could be related to the level of scrutiny Facebook’s Libra project received from regulators and lawmakers after it was announced. Of course, there are key differences with how Libra and Bitcoin work at a fundamental level.Additionally, the first ‘40 Act-approved Bitcoin fund was recently announced, which has led ETF Trends CEO Tom Lydon to claim there is a 60% chance for the approval of a Bitcoin ETF in 2020."

significant headwinds in cryptocurrency payments using more traditional ...","Editors' Pick|Feb 5, 2020,10:00am EST",Lightning Labs co-founder Elizabeth Stark on stage at The Lightning Conference. ,"Bitcoin payments startup Lightning Labs has raised $10 million to expand its payments network that lets companies and individuals spend bitcoin as easily as more traditional services. Building on a seed round from Square founder Jack Dorsey, Robinhood co-founder Vlad Tenev, and Litecoin creator Charlie Lee, among others, Craft Ventures led the round, with a who’s who of traditional investors participating, including Howard Morgan, former global co-head of securities at Goldman Sachs, John Pfeffer, formally of KKR, and Forbes 30 Under 30 alum Jill Carlson of Slow Ventures, and formerly a trader at Goldman Sachs.In addition to the capital raise, Palo Alto-based Lightning Labs today launched its first financial services product, Lightning Loop, to monetize the so-called “layer-two” technology that sits on top of the bitcoin blockchain by making it easier for startups to accept the cryptocurrency. With traditional bitcoin payments firms like Bitpay and Coinbase making significant headwinds in cryptocurrency payments using more traditional technology, the one-two punch of fundraising and a product launch using the more efficient Lightning is a positive sign for the network’s adoption.But competition is right around the corner. Last month a team of five people working at payments giant Square’s crypto offices announced it was working on its own developer kit to make it easier to build on Lightning. If this new breed of cryptocurrency products catches on it would amount to a Visa payments network, without Visa as a gate-keeper, according to Lightning Labs co-founder and CEO Elizabeth Stark. “We’re building the Visa network for bitcoin,” says Stark. “But what I think is powerful, is unlike Visa, anybody can build on top of it.”Founded in 2016, by Stark and Forbes 30 Under 30 alum Olaoluwa Osuntokun, Lightning Labs is building on the open source Lightning Network codebase, a platform similar to the Visa network, which sits on top of a collection of banks and allows for instant payments. But unlike Visa, the Lightning Network consists of 11,000 nodes that anyone can run, and relies on the underlying, decentralized bitcoin network for its liquidity, not the traditional financial system.Since launching its first test version of the network that used real bitcoin in March 2018, 4,000 developers have started building on the technology, according to Stark, including 30 startups, such as San Francisco-based Fold App, which lets users shop at Amazon, Uber and Target using Lightning and earn bitcoin rewards; San Francisco-based bitcoin brokerage River Financial, which lets users buy and sell bitcoin on Lightning; and Hong Kong-based cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex, which in December 2019 started running its own Lightning node. For some comparison, the entire bitcoin ecosystem, including funds held onto by investors, totals about $171 billion, only $30 million of which actually moves on a daily basis. Visa on the other hand, transacted an average of $22 billion a day in 2018. In order to chip into that massive payments market share Stark says startups like hers need to build products that can handle more than bitcoin’s seven transactions per second (Visa can conduct as many as 65,000 transactions per second), and more advanced financial products for which people are actually willing to pay. So, while building on open-source technology like Lightning can be difficult to monetize in the early years, Stark believes a suite of financial services products being built on-top of the network could help make Lightning Labs self-sustaining. Publicly launched today, Lightning Loop is the company’s first such paid product, charging tens of basis points per transaction to help companies store bitcoin directly on the Lightning Network without Lightning Labs, or another third party, taking custody of the cryptocurrency—as opposed to custodial solutions where regulated software providers hold the cryptocurrency for their customers. In the last 90 days since the platform launched to a closed group of testers it has more than doubled in volume, according to Stark, who describes the volume as “not insignificant.”“People think: ‘lightning is open source, how can you make money off of it?’” she says. “But really we’re building a new type of financial network for financial markets, which has all these interesting possibilities.”To help complete other monetized financial products Stark says are currently in development, Lightning Labs plans to spend the new round of capital on hiring new developers, a project manager and a business strategist. The company has grown from 11 employees a year ago to 16 employees today, and plans to hire as many as six more over the next year. While Stark declined to share details about the other financial products in development, she added that the company will be working to integrate Wumbo functionality, code named after a bit in Sponge Bob Square Pants, which promises to increase the transaction capacity of each Lightning channel from about .167 bitcoin or about $1,500, paving the way for a whole range of financial products. To give an idea of the competition in the space, newly launched Coinbase Commerce processed $135 million worth of cryptocurrency payments in 2019 without using Lightning, while veteran cryptocurrency payment processor Bitpay transacted $1 billion for its merchants last year, and is now evaluating whether or not to add support for Lightning wallets. Also, in spite of being an investor in Lightning Labs, Square co-founder Jack Dorsey earlier this year revealed his company was working on potentially competing software for developers to build on the Lightning Network. As far as new Lightning Investor Jill Carlson of Slow Ventures is concerned, the more the merrier. Carlson, 29, spent two years studying what makes people spend (or not spend) bitcoin. In addition to helping allocate the blockchain portion of Slow Ventures $220 million fund, Carlson, founded the non-profit Open Money Initiative, which is conducting firsthand research with individuals in Venezuela who use bitcoin instead of the nation’s hyper-inflated bolivar. Carlson says the reason Venezuelans spend bitcoin is because the pain of using such an unstable currency outweighs the difficulty of spending bitcoin. But as projects like Lightning take off, which make spending bitcoin easier, that pain threshold will lower, making spending more likely. “Looking at the size of lightning specifically and bitcoin more broadly, it still feels so huge of an untapped area that I think it’s one of the few venture opportunities where we could see the 1,000X growth that we’re looking for,” Carlson says.Another new Lightning investor John Pfeffer, who previously led KKR’s private equity investments in the European retail industry, co-founded Pfeffer Capital with his wife in 2011, and bought his first bitcoin in 2016, when the price was about $400, compared to about $9,500 today. Since then, Pfeffer has invested directly in the development of bitcoin’s code by sponsoring numerous core developers who might otherwise be forced to work (or not work) on the open-source software for free, as well as making donations to non-profit advocacy group Coin Center, MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative and co-founding Bitcoin Optech to help bitcoin users better implement technology that helps bitcoin scale, all of which he believes could help strengthen the underlying asset class, but aren’t likely to generate any short-term returns. On the other hand, Pfeffer describes Lightning Labs as a rare opportunity for both to happen. “It’s good for bitcoin,” he says. “And we think it’s potentially a very attractive direct investment opportunity on its own.”"

Cryptocurrency is property.Bitcoin and its competitors look a lot like money: they’re a store of value and a means of exchange. But the Internal Revenue Service has decreed that these assets are not currency and not securities either. They are property. More like a shopping mall than like a $100 bill.As capital assets, they give rise to capital gains and losses when disposed of. A profit is taxable as a short-term gain if a position has been held for a year or less, as long-term if held for more than a year. If a coin is held for profit rather than amusement, which is presumably almost always the case, then a loss on it is a deductible capital loss.In computing a gain or loss you use as your starting point the “basis” of an asset, tax lingo for your original purchase price (after, occasionally, some adjustments).2. Sales are not the only form of taxable transaction.You have to report the disposition of a virtual coin if it is:—sold for cash,—traded for another crypto, or—used to buy something.But merely transferring coins, such as from a wallet to an exchange or vice versa, is not a disposition. Nor do investors who buy and hold owe a tax.3. The tax code’s wash sale rule does not apply.This rule forbids the claiming of a loss on sale of a security if you bought that security within 30 days before or after. If, for example, you buy a Tesla share at $800, sell it at $720, then buy it back quickly, the $80 loss is suspended.But bitcoins and the like are not “securities.” They’re pieces of “property.” So you can go out at a loss and then right back in without losing the right to immediately claim the loss.4. Exchanges squeal.Coin exchanges based in the U.S. file information returns on customers with a lot of trades. The 1099-K is mandatory for a customer who in one calendar year does at least 200 transactions with proceeds totalling at least $20,000. This is the same cutoff for other intermediaries handling property transactions, such as Ebay. (Some states have lower thresholds.)The 1099-K form is rather like the 1099-B that stockbrokers file, except that the latter form doesn’t have the 200-trade minimum and the K probably won’t tell you what your cost basis was for a coin. As with 1099-Bs, so with the Ks, the fact that you didn’t get the form (because you didn’t do a lot of trading or for any other reason) does not absolve you of the obligation to report all sales and other dispositions.5. Forks can create ordinary income.When a share of stock splits in two, by and large, there’s no taxable transaction. Its purchase price gets carved up and assigned to the two pieces; you declare a sale on either of those pieces only when you dispose of it. If and when you do sell a piece at a gain you’ll get the favorable capital gain treatment. This is what would happen if one share of Exxon Mobil split into one share of Exxon and one share of Mobil.The IRS has a different view of coin splitups that occur when a blockchain forks into two chains. It thinks that the split creates a windfall equal to the starting value of the newly created coin, and that this windfall should be taxed at high ordinary-income rates.This is what happened when bitcoin (BTC) spun off bitcoin cash (BCH) in 2017. Each old BTC coin continued to live on one chain while one newly created BCH, on a new chain, was dropped into the lap of the BTC owner. You were supposed to declare the value of BCH as ordinary income. It’s a good bet that many coin holders neglected to do so.How does the tax agency justify its rule? With some very strained logic. It sees a coin split as less like an oil company splitting in two than it is like a taxpayer stumbling on a $100 bill in a parking lot.The new currency created by a fork is income when you can get your hands on it. This is true even if you hold on to the new currency. The cost basis for the new coins is whatever you had to report as income.6. Airdrops create ordinary income. An “airdrop” is the random distribution of coins in the course of a marketing effort. (The IRS has also used the term, incorrectly, to describe the spin-off explained in the previous section.) With considerably more justification than it has taxing forks, the IRS considers marketing giveaways to be ordinary income.You report the income from a marketing scheme as soon as you get the freebie. That reported income becomes the cost basis if you later dispose of the coins. The dollar amount will probably be small; people don’t give away valuable coins.7. Mining creates ordinary income.Suppose you join a mining pool, spend $8,000 on electricity and get rewarded with a bitcoin worth $9,800. Even if you don’t sell the coin, you have to report a $1,800 profit and that profit is ordinary income.Your new possession has a basis of $9,800 and any gain or loss from that point is a capital gain or loss. That could create a painful result. If the coin collapses in value to $8,000 and you sell it then, you have broken even, but you’ll probably owe tax. That’s because you’d be combining $1,800 of ordinary income, taxed at a high rate, with $1,800 of capital loss, which may be worth considerably less on your tax return.The profit and loss described here applies if you are mining with the aim of making money. If, in contrast, the IRS can show that your mining is no more than a hobby, then you get stuck with hobby accounting. That’s a disaster. Hobbyists must report all their revenue as income but can’t deduct any of their costs.8. Staking gives rise to ordinary income.Some crypto chains, like tezos, reward participants for putting up their coins as collateral and then certifying transactions. The reward coins are treated, like bank interest, as ordinary income. Some exchanges handle this work for you and then split the revenue. In that case your income is your share of the fee, not the gross amount.9. Gifts of crypto to charity get treated like gifts of stock, up to a point.Buy a coin at $4,000, wait more than a year and donate when it’s worth $9,000, and you get a $9,000 deduction without having to pay tax on the $5,000 gain. But gifts of property (as opposed to securities) worth more than $5,000 need appraisals, so this can get messy.If you donate appreciated property after holding it for less than a year, your deduction is limited to your cost basis.What about depreciated property? Don’t give it away. Sell it and take the capital loss.10. Gifts of crypto to friends and relatives are treated like gifts of stock.A donee’s cost basis and holding period are the same as if you still held the coins, but with one small distinction: If the property has fallen in value during your ownership, then a special rule comes into play.Say you bought a bitcoin at $12,000 and give it to your niece when it’s worth $11,000. If she sells at more than $12,000, then she uses $12,000 as her basis. If she sells at less than $11,000, she has to use $11,000 as her basis, reducing the capital loss that she can claim. Any sale between $11,000 and $12,000 is in a dead zone that creates neither a gain nor a loss.11. Like-kind tax postponement doesn’t work.With the like-kind rule, people aimed to treat the exchange of one crypto for another as a nontaxable event, postponing tax until sale of the new coin. It probably didn’t work for tax years before 2018, because coin exchanges didn’t meet the exacting requirements for like-kind intermediaries. It definitely doesn’t work for 2018 and later years because a new statute limits like-kind treatment to real estate swaps.12. Bitcoin futures are Section 1256 contracts.Futures on bitcoins, traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, get the peculiar tax treatment of commodity futures: (a) Positions are “marked to market” on Dec. 31, with paper gains and losses recognized as if the futures position were sold and immediately bought back. (b) The gains and losses are assumed to be 60% long-term, 40% short-term, no matter how long the position has been held.13. Crypto is probably subject to the straddle rule.This rule forbids you to deduct a loss on closing a position in an actively traded investment (stock, option, whatever) while you maintain an open position that runs in the opposite direction. Thus, if you own an S&P 500 fund while simultaneously holding a short position in S&P futures, you can’t sell just one of these to claim a capital loss while still holding the offsetting position.You could run into a problem here if you have multiple positions in bitcoin, bitcoin futures or bitcoin options.14. Offshore crypto is probably not subject to FBAR and Fatca reporting.These two regulatory regimes compel you to disclose cash and securities held in offshore accounts. They don’t, however, apply to property that isn’t cash or securities. So your bitcoin account at Malta-based Binance is not covered by these rules.Some lawyers advise you to file the reports anyway. If you trade during the year into conventional currencies (like dollars or euros) you might cross a threshold and be required to file. The labor cost of filing is small; the penalties for not complying are severe.The FBAR (Foreign Bank & Financial Accounts form), which kicks in if an offshore account tops $10,000 at any point during the year, must be filed electronically. The Fatca (Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act), has different thresholds that start at $50,000. The form, number 8938, can be filed on paper.You don’t need to file these reports for assets held at a U.S.-regulated exchange like Coinbase.Exemption from account disclosure does not confer an exemption from the rule mandating the reporting of any sale at a gain. If you have a profit from crypto, even a dollar, then it has to go on your tax return no matter where the coin is held.15. Identifying lots works as it does with securities.Say you buy 5 bitcoins at $6,000 and 5 more at $8,000. Now you sell one coin for $9,000. Was it one of the early ones (creating a $3,000 gain) or one of the late ones (a $2,000 gain)? The IRS gives you two choices.The default choice is first-in-first-out. In a rising market, that tends to give you high tax bills.The second choice is “specific identification.” You maintain meticulous records enabling you to spell out which coin was sold. This enables you to make a selection that minimizes your tax bill (usually, the coin with the highest purchase price). It helps to have a coin tracking service handle the dirty work.For articles by this author on tax-wise investing, go here.For news on crypto and blockchain, go here.For a helpful Q&A from the tax police, go here."

Its purpose is to elevate fintech executives through shared knowledge, strategies, and network, and it poses an unparalleled opportunity for those on a mission to impact millions of people from all around the world, and to reach their set goals, faster.","At the Capital Mastermind, there won’t be any speakers, keynotes, booths, or retail investors since this is no usual conference event. Instead, they accommodate a maximum of 25 executives through a 4-day, 5-star all-inclusive and the Mastermind itself is taking place at one of the largest and most luxurious private mansions in Mexico. The Capital Mastermind is hosted by its parent company, The Capital, a financial micro-blogging social networking platform, powered by Bitcoin. In other words, it is a user-focused financial news platform rewarding those who share their knowledge and news on the platform through posts, also known as “caps”, and through articles, videos, or podcasts. With this system, you get all the benefits of social media and publishing platforms combined with incentives.When it comes to financial news, it can be extremely difficult to get the information that you want or to share the information that you know in a way that doesn’t involve a web design that hasn’t changed in the past 2 decades. Even if you do find a place to share your information, chances are you don’t get rewarded for your time and effort. That’s where this upcoming platform can make a big difference to you as a news consumer or content creator.The Capital allows anyone to create content relevant to finance. The better the reputation a content creator achieves and the higher reach the content creator pulls together, the more money they can earn in the so-called Satoshi, which is the smallest unit of the Bitcoin digital currency. Not only that, regular users are likewise incentivized to engage posts with likes, comments, and shares for a small, but noticeable Satoshi reward. The Capital is designed to feel like your favorite social media platforms while being 100% original, but if you’re looking to create paid content then you can get everything you need right from within this platform. If you have built a certain reputation for yourself, then you can allow companies to fund your posts in exchange for an app or logo placement within your post. In contrast to other platforms like YouTube, this gives you a much higher level of control over which companies advertise on your content, as well as the size of the income that you generate from it. The higher the reach and the better the reputation you have, the higher you can charge the companies willing to fund you. The Capital is probably the last place you’ll ever need for anything finance-related due to the way it’s reinventing social media and the ability to conduct research for content. The platform allows you, for instance, to watch crypto prices on Coinbase, do research on Forbes, or watch market movements on TradingView all while never leaving the platform. This is essential for a perfect and well-optimized workflow for content creation. PlatformThe Capital Mastermind and The Capital platform are founded by Emil Sterndorff and Stefan Petersen.

Last year’s bull run has already led to many 2020 Bitcoin price predictions, ranging from $20,000 to $50,000.However, there is one overlooked data point that sums up Bitcoin’s tremendous 2019 better than any other.Many cryptocurrency pundits have pointed out that the Bitcoin price responded to the recently increased tensions between the United States and Iran in a manner similar to gold; however, despite all of the comparisons, the reality is that there isn’t much of a correlation between these two assets at all.Having said that, Bitcoin became more correlated to gold than all of the major altcoins in the second half of 2019, which indicates that the “digital gold” term may be becoming much more than just a meme.While Bitcoin has been referred to as digital gold for a number of years, 2019 was the year when this analogy really started to take hold. Bitcoin was a topic of conversation around the developing trade war between the United States and China, the use of Bitcoin as an inflation hedge gained greater notoriety, and the ultimate bull case for Bitcoin as a true digital gold gained steam.Even members of the United States Congress began to describe Bitcoin as an enormously valuable asset that could eventually threaten the U.S. dollar’s global reserve currency status.The specific reasoning behind the increased understanding of Bitcoin’s role in the financial world is difficult to pin down; although, it’s possible Facebook’s Libra project led to an awakening. This was certainly the case for CNBC’s Joe Kernen.The above chart showers the historical correlations of Bitcoin, Ether, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin to ... [+] gold.As the above chart from Coin Metrics shows, Bitcoin separated itself from the rest of the cryptocurrency market in terms of a closer correlation with gold in the second half of 2019. Bitcoin’s 180-day Spearman correlation coefficient was over 0.1 for much of December, while the coefficients for Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin were all below 0.05. On a related note, the altcoin market more generally has severely struggled against Bitcoin over the past couple of years.While Bitcoin still has plenty of work to do in terms of competing with gold as a global, apolitical store of value, the crypto asset took a major step forward in 2019. Bitcoin’s relative correlation to gold compared with other crypto assets should be a trend to watch throughout 2020."

It is, however, easy to forget the altcoins.When bitcoin goes up, the altcoins follow. Altcoins are lashed to bitcoin by exchanges and they move in relation to the dollar inline, but not exactly, with bitcoin. When bitcoin rallies so do altcoins, but some underperform and others overperform.My basic premise for predicting this rally is:1) Bitcoin is a safe haven asset. To repeat a cliché, bitcoin is the new gold.2) Iranians will want to get into bitcoin as tensions rise.3) Speculators will want to trade BTC in a crisis because it has more beta volatility “pop” than gold or oil, so you trade that for maximum situation volatility instead of slow gold or oil.4) Anyone wanting to hedge their stocks might use the roughly, 5x hedging beta of bitcoin to cover their equities in a crisis situation. By my ready reckoning, currently, $1 of bitcoin gives you about $5 of equity downside hedge. That’s very cheap and compelling.But bitcoin is not the only game in town. This is the performance of the big high privacy coin monero, bitcoin and upstart bitcoin cash:Bitcoin, Monero and Bitcoin Cash performanceYou can see that bitcoin cash and monero have even bigger beta than bitcoin. For maximum impact it is the altcoins that can deliver the maximum return in the high risk trading game.It is truly fascinating that the ultra-privacy coin monero takes off early alongside oil and gold but that bitcoin lags a few hours. You can come up with your own conclusions on that one. I would put that down to two different audiences reacting to the news in different time zones.Whatever the reason, you can see that monero is the winner and you can judge that it is the privacy aspects of the coin that gives it the extra punch as there are most certainly “big money” players who will want extreme secrecy when using crypto as a hedge or a haven.This U.S./Iran conflict is not going to go away; as such there is a strong catalyst unpinning crypto for many months to come.The more dire an investor’s prognosis for what happens next, the more bitcoin they should hold because the worse the developments the higher bitcoin and altcoins will rise.In any event what is clearly established is that Bitcoin is a financial instrument that reacts to world events and that in itself it an extremely powerful use case, no less than any valuable futures derivative contract that trades in the billions of dollars of value between parties wishing to swap risks.——Clem Chambers is the CEO of private investors website ADVFN.com and author of 101 Ways to Pick Stock Market Winners and Trading Cryptocurrencies: A Beginner’s Guide.

A few weeks ago, I mentioned the possibility of a bottom in price that had become evident in mid to late December, based on classic technical indicators. It looks like a good call while we see if it’s just temporary or has staying power.Here’s the daily price chart for Bitcoin, annotated:Bitcoin daily price chart, 1 14 20.The “bullish engulfing” candlestick of mid-December is circled in red. The name is derived from the peculiar style of the price action. Sellers took it below the previous day’s low price and then buyers came in and took it above the previous day’s high price. Hence, engulfing. When this type of candlestick shows up, it can indicate the possibility of a reversal and it appears as if that’s what we’ve got.That possibility seemed to be confirmed by 2 other technical indicators used by price chart analysts since forever. First, you can see how the relative strength indicator (RSI), shown above the price chart, is diverging positively from the price. Second, the moving average convergence/divergence indicator (MACD), below the price chart, is also diverging positively.No single technical indicator by itself can be relied on as predictive, but when 3 seem to line up and agree on the possibility of a reversal, it’s a decent enough alert to price chart analysts that something may be up. In this case, it appears to have been on the money. Back above the Ichimoku cloud now is also a positive.Here’s the Ethereum daily price chart:Ethereum daily price chart, 1 14 20.Although some slight differences exist, this is basically the same basic pattern as Bitcoin. Ethereum traders tend to be more volatile with wider up and downs. You can see how much higher this crypto broke above the early January peak and on much greater volume (circled in red). Here’s the Litecoin daily price chart:Litecoin daily price chart, 1 14 20.It’s a big volume move that takes the Litecoin price well above that early January peak and above the Ichimoku cloud for the first time on this chart. A close above the November peak of 65 might be significant and it doesn’t seem to be that far away.After stocks began selling off today when news emerged that China tariffs would remain in place, I would guess that some of the speculative profits taken there found their way into cryptocurrencies. Just guessing. Whatever the reason, it’s clear that buying interest has re-emerged. Whether this will continue is the question, as always.I do not hold positions in these investments. No recommendations are made one way or the other.  If you're an investor, you'd want to look much deeper into each of these situations. You can lose money trading or investing in stocks and other instruments. Always do your own independent research, due diligence and seek professional advice from a licensed investment advisor."

Over two million small businesses use it to accept cards instead of cash.And getting a credit card no longer requires filling out piles of paperwork and answering a banker’s questions. Smartphone giant Apple (AAPL) made a splash when it debuted its shiny new titanium credit card last August.These disruptors will end banks as we know them. Nobody cares if banks have fancy lobbies with marble floors these days. Most Americans just want a fast and convenient way to manage their money.I haven’t stepped foot in a bank in years. And foot traffic into branches has fallen close to 50% in the past decade.Many folks assume “old” money companies like Visa and Mastercard are in trouble too. These folks are wrong.Visa and Mastercard Are “Untouchable” Stocks What few people realize is all the ""money disruptors” I just mentioned are plugged into Visa and Mastercard’s networks.Apple designed its titanium card to resemble its sleek products. But did you know it runs on Mastercard’s network? And credit cards from PayPal, Square, and Stripe all have Visa or Mastercard logos.These disruptors aren’t ripping out the pipes of our financial system and trying to cut out Visa and Mastercard. Instead, they’re partnering with them, sending even more money flowing through their networks.Remember, each time you pay with a card, Visa and Mastercard collect a small fee. In fact, even when you pay with your phone, these giants make money. Apple Pay, Google Pay, and Amazon Pay, are simply “apps” built on Visa and Mastercard networks!Nobody Can Touch These “Untouchable” StocksHow we move money around and pay for things has changed for good. Yet these changes have only cemented Visa and Mastercard’s dominance.They’ve built payment networks nobody can match. More than 30,000 banks use their credit cards. There are 3.4 billion Visa cards alone in circulation!And now partnerships with PayPal, Square, and others are injecting a new wave of growth into Visa and Mastercard. Visa’s sales shot up 11.5% last year to a record $22 billion. And Mastercard’s revenue jumped 20% to $14.5 billion.They Are Two of the Most Consistently Impressive Businesses I’ve Ever AnalyzedVisa’s profit margins are 5X better than the average US stock. It turns 52 cents on every dollar into pure profit. Mastercard’s profit margins are 3X better than the average S&P 500 company. If you’re investing for the long haul, you could do a lot worse than owning these two undisruptible tollbooth stocks.Get my report ""The Great Disruptors: 3 Breakthrough Stocks Set to Double Your Money"". These stocks will hand you 100% gains as they disrupt whole industries. Get your free copy here."

A rally that began three weeks ago lost steam last week.By Saturday evening, Bitcoin was down 6.43%, ETH was down 7.38%, XRP was down 8.44%, and LTC dropped 11.20%. Bitcoin slid back towards the key $8,000-mark.The retreat was board with only 18 out of the top 100 cryptocurrencies advancing and 82 dropping.That's a significant change from the previous when 90 cryptocurrencies advanced out of the top 100.And it came as the spread of coronavirus unsettled financial markets.That should have come as a surprise to digital asset experts. Bitcoin has emerged as a safe-haven asset in times of global uncertainties, according to some studies. And should have been rallying rather than retreating last week.koyfin_20200126_081340494Is Bitcoin's pull-back just the pause of the rally or something more serious?Christopher Brookins, Founder and CIO at Valiendero Digital Assets, thinks that Bitcoin is re-affirming his previous position that the rally takes a ""breather."" ""At the time of writing, the Hurst Exponent is still recovering from oversold levels and its recent ""breather,"" with a value of 0.52,” he says. “The resumption in upward trajectory after its brief consolidation and value still being far from overbought territory bodes well for price in the near to mid-term.""Brookins' estimates apply the Hurst exponent (H) model, which is rooted in mathematics founded by Benoit Mandelbrot, to determine if a financial market is trending or not.Screen Shot 2020-01-25 at 7.40.21 PMHe's watching the $8400 (short-Kumo Cloud) and $8600 (long-Kumo Cloud), but he remains bullish in the digital currency, in the face of the upcoming halving.And he sticks in his previous prediction that ETH price increases are unlikely to last for a sustained period, and that will lag behind BTC.""As stated prior, given the dramatic reversal in Hurst values to overbought, ETH price increases are unlikely to last for a sustained period in 2020,"" he says. ""Furthermore, given the divergence between ETH and BTC Hurst values, we expect BTC to begin demonstrably outperforming ETH over the coming weeks and months.""

Despite President Xi Jinping’s October statement in support of blockchain technology, Chinese leaders do not appear to be willing to relinquish control and power by welcoming decentralized cryptocurrencies to the country.""The currency is not for speculation,"" Mu Changchun, head of the People’s Bank of China’s digital currency research institute, said of the bank’s plans for its forthcoming currency that it hopes citizens will adopt in favor of bitcoin.Holiday trading volumes were light for cryptocurrencies, as bitcoin remained in a narrow channel around $7,000.

Prices as of 4:00 p.m. on January 3, 2020.United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres touted blockchain as an essential tool for the future of the organization that generates $50 billion in annual revenue. The UN hopes to use blockchain technology to be more transparent with donors about how its money is spent and reduce waste in its supply chain.“For the United Nations to deliver better on our mandate in the digital age, we need to embrace technologies like blockchain that can help accelerate the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals,” Guterres said in a statement provided exclusively to Forbes.One example that the UN has already put into action: partnering with Mongolia and its farmers in a pilot project to export sustainable cashmere using an ethereum-based blockchain.Hundreds of bitcoin and cryptocurrency-related videos disappeared from YouTube around Christmas. Chris Dunn, an influencer with 210,000 subscribers on the platform, tweeted that YouTube cited “harmful or dangerous content” and the “sale of regulated goods” when it took down his videos.Although YouTube quickly said the purge was an error and all the videos would be reinstated, it continues a pattern of resistance from Google against cryptocurrencies. The search engine giant, which owns YouTube, banned cryptocurrency advertising for most of the summer before relenting in September and also suspended Ethereum mobile wallet MetaMask from the Google Play Store.Forbes’ first Blockchain 50 list last year highlighted the steps 50 major enterprises are taking to adopt blockchain technology. With so many new blockchain projects launching since that list was published, we want to know which companies deserve to be added to this year’s list and which ones should stay on for the second time.
